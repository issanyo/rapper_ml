[HOOK #1 - ESHAM]
Ooh, ooh
Looking at you
Loving this view
Feeling brand new
'Cause I'm feeling so true
Girl, this song is 'bout you
If I was in Texas
I'd be like, "What it do?"

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
But I be like, "What up, though?"
'Cause you know I'm from the Mo-
Town, put it down
East side, got the crown
I done been around the world
And I'm coming back around
Round of applause
When you hear me
Clap 'em down
I was born up in New York
I learned that new talk
Was raised in Detroit
'Cause I'm a D-boy
Yes, yes ya'll
I'm fresh
No need to guess, ya'll
North, South, East, or West
Ain't no best, ya'll
Oh no, baby don't go
Getting money fast
But I spend it real slow
I'm a pro, though
Reel Life logo
R-L-P, not Ralph Lauren Polo

[HOOK #1]

[HOOK #2 - MASTAMIND]
Damn who's she
Looking at who, me
When she walks by
Got me thinking, "Ooh wee"
I think she
Liking how I do me
Surviving this game is
Small things to a G

[VERSE 2:  MASTAMIND]
I'm from the motherfucking D
Where the bitches hate fucking for free
I got a few stacks
So it's nothing for me
Make her play bartender
Fill the cup up for me
Make her play the role
Of a stripper and a wife
Let her lay low
Let me get this life
When they gon' catch up to the
Vroom, vroom
When they gon' salute
To the devil in the moon
God damn
I hope it's soon
I know she's down
'Cause she singing my tunes
Rolling with me
Rolling something short of loyalty
In Alabama
I will call you my shorty
In the Deep South
I'mma stay deep in her mouth
In case she got some ill shit
'Bout me to speak about
Respect, like The Godfather
You might see me hard at work
But I'mma party even harder

[HOOK #3 - ESHAM]
Oh, oh
Baby out cold
Finna get 'sposed
Curling my toes
'Cause I'm feeling so prose
Yo, this song is 'bout 'yos
If I was in Detroit
I'd be like, "What up, though?"
