I wanna know, are you true?
Can you woo woo woo woo?
They don't thug it like I do
Can you woo woo woo woo?
I wanna know, are you true?
Can you woo oo woo woo?
They don't run this like we do
Can you woo woo woo woo?

[Esham]
Is it true? Is it deja vu?
Is it you, can I come through and kick it with you?
Can we Woo Woo Woo, sniff a little OOH OOH?
Don't really matter, cause you still my boo boo
We can slide out, ride out, back to my hideout
Your man will never find out, you should just try it out
Ain't no hesitation, baby holla at this action
Cause I "Woo Woo Woo" like my name was Freddy Jackson
Baby askin am I blastin? All my homies is assassins
Cause the guns we like to flash 'em, but tonight I'm just relaxin'
Baby askin am I paid? Askin am I loco?
Askin if I'm gassin yours up like Sonoco?
Oh no, I Sonny Bono hoes like Yoko
On a train going from Detroit to Tokyo
"Konichiwa" but we say "What Up?" though
And if you actin' shady, we be like "shut up ho"

[Esham]
One two, can you Woo Woo Woo?
Three, four, five, six, all in the mix
Silly rabbit, tricks are for kids
Ain't no playing games when I got the Remi, twisting off the lid
Then I'm like shit, burn rubber skid
Girl you deserve this, ain't no telling what he did
Fuck him and them ugly kids
Let's "Woo Woo" till the ride blow off your wig

[Hook]

[Esham]
Tell me you don't, still don't ride, cause I can feel you there
I'm trying to get you near, thats why a killer here
You looking at me wierd, cause there's a hater in your ear
They only hate it when I'm near, because they fade and disappear
We 'bout to bar out, star out, I'll have them pull the car out
I'm trying to be with you until it's deep until tommorow
Your man ain't hit no switches, so he's mad and hitting bitches
But you better than beginners, give me head up on these spinners
See you standing with that fairy, ain't no way that he your man boo
Trying to understand you, open up and let the man through
I'm handing you the exo, and he went and got you pop
When its gonna stop? Come on lets hit the spot and make the car hop
Let's go to Puerto Rica, and we can go and freaka
I'm beaming light shining out your stereo speakers
We'll fuck in secret places only we will know
Rubbing faces, moving slow, let's pick the pace up and let's go
