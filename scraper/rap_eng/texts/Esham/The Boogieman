[VERSE 1]
Let's play dead
And give me a second to die
And if I do or die
I sing a lullaby
I'm not a crime fighter
I'm like a ghost writer
And then my rhyme is like a Chips Ahoy!
I bet 'cha bite a
And they don't understand
A rock and roll band
I'm not the KK Klan
But like The Boogieman
And Satan's in the mix
And you don't wanna dis
Because this is 4 All The Suicidalists
I'd Rather Be Dead
I'm Knocking 'Em Dead
Before you live you die
Roll over, play dead
And I'm the B-double-O-G-I-D-M-A-D-M-A-N
Amen, Another Sin
Here we go a-fucking-gain
Taking to the T-O-P
You don't want to fuck with me
Cause I'm The Boogieman and I'm M-A-D, G
Now you want know
Uh how we go and here we go
Unholy's my scenario
Kicking it in stereo
Stylistic
Kicking the ballistics
Kind of magnificent
But always staying mystic
You don't understand cause you can't and I can
I got the whole world in my hand
Cause I'm The Boogieman

[SAMPLES]

Call, call me The Boogieman

[VERSE 2]
I'd rather be dope
Than praying and wishing on a hope
That's all she wrote
So fuck John the Pope
And if I do that
I'll give a clue, jack
I'm the Unholy but you already knew that
I'm a Black Devil
Black sheep
Black rhythm
Black rhyme
Black beat
Yo, I never went pop with Acid Hip Hop
Uh with a 1, 2 and you don't stop
I keep it going, I
I know you're knowing, I
The way I'm going I'm showing you how I'm flowing, I
I hold my black dick
Just like a pool stick
My cue ball's in my corner pocket so watch it
But you don't understand cause you can't and I can
I got the whole world in my hand
Cause I'm The Boogieman

Call, Call me the boogieman (repeats)
