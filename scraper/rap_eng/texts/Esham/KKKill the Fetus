[Parliament-Funkadelic sample (from "Maggot Brain"):]
"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the Universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit."

"Mother Earth is pregnant ---" x6
"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time"

Why would you want to make a life in this world we live in?
Love ain't worth a dime, so then you nothin to give him
The baby had no father, he ran out on the mama
So raise him as a cannibal to be like Jeffrey Dahmer
Your life is really worthless: you live, and then you die
You're gonna die, and bodies rot and then you wonder why
And then you live in doubt:
Can you live or live without?
The facts you know, you can't afford to feed another mouth
Your head is steady spinnin
The Devil's steady grinnin
While you was steady sinning
From the very first beginning
Is it a boy or a girl?
I think I should be feral
You should terminate it, because it's a lousy world
Your life is on the line
You're out your fuckin' mind
You gotta do it soon, cause you're runnin' outta time
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though

The baby's premature
The mother is a whore
Contemplatin suicide, so what you waitin for?
I think I heard it kicking, but that's a normal state
Jam a hanger in ya asshole until your water breaks
You better use some caution
Givin' yourself an abortion
Death's the only way to solve a suicide solution
So here's my contribution
My suicide solution
You play the game of death, but then you can't win or lose it
You wonder if you want this
Or should you kill the fetus?
Life is just a waste, so then you oughta just delete this
"Problem to society"?
Society's the problem
My suicide solution is a .38 revolver [gunshot]
I'm your problem solver
Your life is full of horror
Some are born today, and some will die tomorrow [girl screams]
Vaginal tissue's torn
Your pussy's kinda worn
I think I oughta warn you if you're having a newborn
You're in your own perspective
There is one contraceptive
Your EPT is positive
So you can't let that baby live
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though

[Esham]
The planet's really fucked
So now you're kinda stuck
You should have thought about it before you busted the nut
It is a lousy world, I live a lousy life
I think I oughta stab you in the stomach with a knife
Or push you down a flight of steps
Until you fall and break ya neck
Did a little damage
Can you manage a miscarriage?
Life is not a choice, death is the alternative
Or should you let it grow up in this fucked up world that we live in?
These are the consequences
Add one more to the State Census
Born to die in poverty, so tell me, what's its sisters?
It's just another embryo attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though
