12 in da morning woke up with tha shakes
Cereal killa mista Frosted Flakes
My hands were all bloody and I don't know why
I'm thinkin bout my bitch and why she had to die
Some niggas outa get me she was settin me up
They pulled out they pistols started wettin me up
I see my life pass before my eyes in a flash
I drew out my weapon and I started to blast
My bitch caught a slug in tha back of tha neck
I emptied out tha clip them niggas hit tha deck
I ran for tha beamer it was sittin in front
I left my bitch body smokin like a Philly blunt//and it was In da Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour it all happened,In da
Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour they start cappin//I'm bleedin like a mutha
Fucka grabbin my chest,my heartbeat racin like a EMS,I called my parter up on
Tha portible phone,I blew my bitch brains out wit tha chrome,My nigga said he'd
Meet me at tha Omni hotel court date was today and he just jumped bail,Police
Outa get'em he was under arrest,Bench warrent for my nigga wit tha mental
Stress,Met my nigga at tha spot and he had nothin to say,Metro airport to East
LA,When we got to tha city it was drama again seen a nigga who we jacked in 89
For 10//and it was in da Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour it all happened,In
Da Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour they start cappin//Tha nigga started
Trippin he was wavin his gun,Pissed off since 89 cuz we murdered his son,Srtay
Bullets started flyin every way but in mine,Still bleedin like pig and I'm
Pressed for time,I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face,Now I'm mad
Then a mutha fucka tryin to embrace,My homie body turned cold,I felt him
Slippin away,He was just here alive now he's dead today,And tha nigga who had
Shot'em he was shot on tha floor,So I went to his body and I shot him some
More,He looked me dead in tha face and said you goin to hell,I spit blood in
His face as I started to tell//In da Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour it all
Happened,In da Midnight hour,In da Midnight hour they start cappin
