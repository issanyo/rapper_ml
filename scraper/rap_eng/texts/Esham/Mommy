Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?
Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?
(How ya doin'?)

[Verse 1]
Mommy how ya doin' boo, I hope you've been fine
Been on my mind, it's been a long time, I'm still on the grind
Can't help but think about the way you did your thang when you did it
You curled my toes when I hit it, I'd be the first to admit it
It's oh so good, I'm feelin' you, uh uh I'm feelin' you
So let me be your murderer, the only one that's killin' you
O-L-D school, kickin' game since pre-school
Down in Miami South Beach by the pool
Where the girls girls, be drivin' 'em wild
I tell ya one more time ma, I'm feelin' your style
Girl he can't be your Superman, but I can be your kryptonite
Cause you lookin' thick tonight, and I'm servin' dick tonight
I stick it like I kick it like, and no I don't go no look-alikes
And when I be chargin' hoes, I be like I drive a hard bargain
I beg your pardon boo boo, never sweat'er like a Fubu
It's true true that I'm cookoo for the chocha when I'm with you

Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?
Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?
(How ya doin'?)

[Verse 2]
Mommy don't mean to press the issue, but oh girl I miss you
Wanna kiss you, never diss you, cause what we got so official
My pockets stay lumpy, cookies stay chunky
And I can't mess with honey if she can't pop that monkey
Kick me down money, ain't shit funny
Cause I'm spinnin' on blades whether rainy or sunny
Mama, cookoo for the chocha, you know I
Never really can say goodbye, mama

Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?
Mommy mommy, how ya doin'?

[Verse 3]
I dedicate this erotic poetry to the mommies who knowin' me
Come blow dro with me, mommy come flow with me
Go with me, roll with me, on ecstacy
Let me be me, you can be you and be free
We, meaning us to just trust that this last
Never get back lost moments when time pass
Mommy cheers to you when I raise my glass
I hope it's always like this when we cross paths
