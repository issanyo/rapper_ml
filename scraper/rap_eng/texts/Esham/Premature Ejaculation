(Repeat 4x)
I can hear my mother call

Momma was a junkie and daddy was a playa
Man I swear, I don't care
About nothin', sometimes I'm rather be dead black
But that's about the millionth time I've said that
I get a headache everytime I start to think
I'm wonderin' why I'm not dead, I'm on the brink
Yo, it's kinda crazy, used to be my baby
But now you're not yourself because you shot yourself
I had a homie who tried to suicide
He died, he lied in a closed casket right
I can't take it, am I gone make it
Suicide's my answer for life's cancer
I used to pray every Sunday
But since Blaz4Me I gotta listen to what my gun say
Can ya dig it, can ya dig it, can ya dig it?
No 40, O.E., gin and juice I'm a swig it, yo
But back to my drama
I finally made my mind up and said fuck my mama
I'mma get my shit straight, my mind I gotta get straight
So I bought a 38 yo
I gotta get my head on
And if ya still think I sing that sad song then you're dead wrong
So check my situation
I guess you can call me a premature ejaculation

(CHORUS)
Man I ain't nothin' but a nut
A premature ejaculation

Yo, life's kinda funny
It seems like we all bleedin' tryin' to get some bloody money
I don't know why
Motherfuckers trippin', talkin' 'bout I'm always high
When I'm gone die, shit
How many problems can one motherfucker get yo
What's wrong with my mind
If it wasn't for the bad times I wouldn't have no times
My baby done left me
She claims I need some mental therapy, she called me crazy
It ain't no sweat though
Cause anyday I canplay Russian Roulette ho
So fuck that trick bitch
Anyway, she was suckin' the next nigga dick, shit
So fuck the perpetration
If you can dig my situation, a premature ejaculation

(CHORUS)

Yo, as the world turns
If one nigga die, 10 niggas might learn from that
The shit runs deep though
"How deep?" 6 feet deep put me to sleep bro
How can I make you understand
And stop you from Stevie Wondering how I'm going under and
You try and diagnose me, analyze me
But the shit don't surprise me
Realize that I see through all eyes gee
I might be wise, but I'm blind just as I see
I'm smokin' on a fat one
I got one in the chamber, cock back on my cap gun
That's the way my life goes
And my life ain't nothin' but bitches and money and hoes
Goes a little somethin' like this
I'm down to the E cause I'm a suicidalist, yo
I look forward to passin' away
And on my way to hell I get some ass on the way, yo
So check my situation
I guess you could call me a premature ejaculation

(CHORUS)
