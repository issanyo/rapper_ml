[VERSE 1]
Was it somethIn' I said that made me your idol
See I'd rather be dead that's why I'm suicidal
And my head keeps spinnin' like every day
But it's best to burn out than to fade away
See I am what I am, and that's all that I am
But when I'm not high, a poor excuse for a man
I ain't drinking no forty, thinking time with the nine
Can't you understand, I'm the trigger man
The dramas in life is so highly diluted
In time you will find wicked rhymes executed
From dawn to dusk you might hear me bust
Deep peep the Wicketshit and your skull'll crush
Exodus, Alpha, Omega come again
All the hate you create is comin' from within
Amen another sin, once my mind is bled
When it's done and said, I'm done and dead
Flatline...
