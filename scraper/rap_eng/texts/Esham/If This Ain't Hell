[Intro] (2x)
Free your mind and your ass will follow
The kingdom of heaven is the man

[Verse 1]
Are you woke, or are you sleeping?
The devil's groove is slowly creeping
It's too late, what's my fate?
Will they let me in heaven's gates?
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's doors
I see whores fucking on the floors
The fire's burning, the cross is turning
Upside down, now I'm learning
I know you knew, well I did too
The devil's in the soup, I drank the witches brew
Red rum, got to get me some
Bloody Mary, now my body's numb
I go, you go, The Serpent and the Rainbow
Adam and Eve, I believe
Picking fruit off the wicket trees
Will I bite? I just might
If I do then I'm through
Lord forgive me, how I lived
How's your wife, and my kids?
I did the crime, I'll do the time
White man trapped inside my mind
Adam and Eve, Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley, Vincent Price
Nappy hair, black sheep
In wolf's clothing it's all deep
Prophecies, coming true
Something you all never knew
Will you love me? Will you hate me?
Would you let your daughter date me?
Where would I take her out on a date?
We'll go knocking on heaven's gates
The President, wants me dead
For some of those things I said
Heaven's gates, the White House gates
Water Gates, paper plates
Look inside your dollar bill
In God we trust, if you will
The pyramid is the great seal
And all that stuff they had to steal
Black man running 360 degrees
The Bible in his hands, still on his knees
Still got to ask the other man please
Give me powder milk and welfare cheese

[Chorus] (4x)
If this ain't hell, I can't tell
Sell my soul inside my cell

[Verse 2]
Washington Redskins, black skins, let me in
Welfare in DC
The President says vote for me
If I do, it seems odd
How one man becomes God
White House, white man
God is money so understand
His plan, master plan
Is to kill off the black man, Jewish man, China man
It really don't matter with gun in hand
War sucks, big bucks
Tell me they don't give a fuck

[Chorus] (2x)

[Outro]
What is the difference? (What is the difference?)
Between (New Orleans!) 1825 (And New York!)
1992 (Washington!) 1776 (Miami!) 1995
In Cut City, there are no black people left
There are no black people left in Cut City!
There are no negros left, no coons left, no jigs left
No niggers left!
