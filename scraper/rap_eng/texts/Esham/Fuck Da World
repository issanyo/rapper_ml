[INTRO: TNT]
Yeah I got some shit on my mind
Some shit that I been wanting to say
Some shit that I got to say

[Hook]
Fuck the world
It's like fuck the world
Fuck the world
I said fuck the world
Fuck the world
You know fuck the world
Fuck the world
I said fuck the world
Fuck the world
You know fuck the world
Fuck the world
I said fuck the world
Fuck the world
It's like fuck the world
Fuck the world

[VERSE 1: TNT]
Fuck the planet I'm on
I wish I was never born
But I was torn to be warned
So now I mourn
My thoughts are paralyzed
I see terror signs
I recognize my mind that I metamorphosize
I hate this planet and the people that live on it
I sold my soul in vain
I feel no pain because I want it
And I'm torn between life and death
And death and life
My blood drips from the blade of a butcher knife
I have thoughts of hate and mental anguish
I hate you
I hate me too
I can't go back to the womb, so I resume the temple of doom
They want to put me in a rubber room
My mama told me there'd be days like this
I be feeling homicidal
Suicidal
Suicidalist
I capped his back
His peel his cap backwards
I'm not religious
But more than just a sacrilegious
You better ask some bod
About the nigga that's odd
And fuck you and your God
And your world

[Hook]

[VERSE 2: TNT]
I'm finna bust
So call me a Mossberg
The sky is falling like dominoes and Donald Byrd
Fuck the world
I'm not your regular human being
You'll never testify
A witness the murder scene
Mercy me
Lord have mercy for weak minds
Must I reach for my nine
Once I'm speaking my mind
They trip
Angel dust make me bust shots
Three little pigs
Blind mice
Why I hate cops
Headache
Migraine
Bring the pain on
What's my maggot brain on
Some insane song
So you sing along
Murder's my national anthem
Aryan Nation hunting for a Black Panther
But killers don't talk
They walk the flatlines
And you should know that I'm out my mind
So fuck the world

[Hook]

[VERSE 3: TNT]
Fuck the world I'm in it
Never represented
Anything
But Reel Life Products
That's why many sing
The Blues
Bad news
Bad times
Bad rhymes
Bad lines
Bad thoughts
Bad shit on my mad mind
Some people say that the world will never end
I got a secret
"Say hello to my little friend"
Push the button
I panic from manic depression
And with my Smith & Wesson
I'll teach you all a lesson
I'm sick of thinking
My mind's blinking paranoid
Once I counteract it
Bullets get interacted
Chain reaction
Can't get no satisfaction
The world is falling apart like Michael Jackson
So fuck them

[Hook]
