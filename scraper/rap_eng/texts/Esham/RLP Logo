Reel Life
Reel Life, Reel Life
One day you'll realize it's all about Reel Life
Reel Life, Reel Life
One day you'll realize it's all about Reel Life

[Verse 1:]
One day when you wake up, your eyes will recognize
That this world is full of lies so don't be surprised when
People come at you the wrong way, you gotta deal wit it
Ill life, Reel Life, still trife, killed twice
My advice, don't get in this game, stay in your lane, it's full of pain
Is everyone in the world insane? There's a black president and ain't shit changed
Gas prices still high, fiends still getting high
Everybody going crazy, to be famous they'll die
Sell their soul, soul for sale, just to get a show in hell
Jay-Z, Beyonce, the Devil yeah he know them well
Everybody blasphemous, the wicked shit I mastered this
But you ain't talking to Eminem if you ain't on the master's list
But still he had a ass to kiss, so you the one puck out your lips
A sleazy fucking lady, man this industry's so shady
It's the reason why you all think I'm crazy
I guess this why the radio don't want to play me, but fuck 'em!

[Verse 2:]
It's real out here, get killed out here, niggas don't give a fuck how you feel out here
Come to Detroit and act a fool, like Kat Williams get smacked out a stool
Crack a joke, gat to smoke, nigga ain't shit funny
I'm going off of what Ice Cube said "Life ain't nothing but bitches and money"
Playboy bunny, rainy, sunny, some niggas eat some niggas hungry
Still I can't explain these hunger pains I get in my tummy
Crime is life and life is crime
I drug your whole team over the touchdown line
"Touchdown!" 'Cause that's all I know how to do
You got your hands up and I ain't thinking about robbin' you
The Soopa Hero, Soopa Villain, I'll clobber you
Whip out the cannon jammie and whop-bam-bobba-loo
And then I come and disrespect at your funeral
Piss on your grave, your headstone will be my urinal
It's real strife I feel like it's ill life
A sucker born every minute, that's real life
