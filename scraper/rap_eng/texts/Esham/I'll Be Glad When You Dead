"Yo, Nineteen ninety ninety whateva
Closed Casket yo, we still comin outta coma
And yo, tell 'em how you feelin right now"

I'll be glad when you dead, takin two to the head
Fill the body bag, blood stains, bloody mag
I can't rest, til I put one dead in the center of your chest
N-A-T-A-S, fuck the gun control, sell my soul
Got the symptoms of insanity, I'm slippin, oh no
And my wicked, kick the wicked, some of the wicked shit I'm backin
Wit' the mack 10, motherfucka what'chyou wanna do?
Fuck yo crew, I don't give a fuck, you know what you can suck
When I buck, betta duck
Or I'ma take one, two, three, niggas down wit me
Cause I don't give a fuck punk, I'll be glad when you dead

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka
I'll be glad when you dead (I'll be glad when you dead)

I wanna see you do drop to them knees when the lemon squeeze
Blowin your brains in the breeze
I said Kill the Fetus, motherfuck a Jesus
Niggas bitin my melody, they keep on tellin me
Now I need some therapy, psychic connection
Dead bodies give me an erection, correction
Correctional facilities, can't get with these
I gave life to the rhythm and I made it breathe
I can't believe, you believe what you believe
If you believe in me then I'll let you see
Until then when it's done an said
I'ma bust one for yo head, I'll be glad when you dead

[Chorus]

I'll be glad when you locked in the body bag, zip-locked
Got the hammer cocked on the Glock
Shot's bust, ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
See the good die young, and all die must
And I trust in no man, no clan
I never run, I never ran, how I could just kill a man
Damn, lick shots Rude Boy come down
In Motown, I don't fuck around
I'ma a nigga-ro, my understandin's zero
Money is my hero
Don't blame me for H-A-T-E, towards me and my crew
We kick the voodoo, and always like fuck you

"Put him in a bag, put him in a bag
Put him in a bag, put him in a bag
Put him in a bag, put him in a bag
Put him in a bag  put him in a bag!!"

[Chorus] - 2X

I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka (I'll be glad when you dead)
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka (wrapped up in a body bag)
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka
I'll be glad when you dead motherfucka
