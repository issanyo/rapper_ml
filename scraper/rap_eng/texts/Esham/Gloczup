Bitch it's time to get paid
How paid?
Fuck a silly snitch
Smoke a motherfucker down
Smokin' on a Philly
Nigga say he gon' kill me
Oh really?
Is he? Is he? Is he? Is he Crazy?
Fuckin' around with Rosemarys Baby
Maybe he just wanna die
Maybe he just wanna die
I be the one to bust shots
I be the one you fuck not
Plus got more raps than any rhymer on your roster
Fake ass Wigga!
You just an imposter
Gotsta bust ya down with the Gauge
As I read ya mind I flip the page
It's a new day and age
2000 A.D
Still they tryin' to play me like a dog wit Rabies
They say he's crazy
Stay up out his way
Before he hits you wit the A-K spray
B-U-L-L-E-T-S
I see you like uh, C-B-S
We smoke the Ganj cuz we be stressed
Fuck with me and catch eternal rest
This is for my niggas in the low-low
On the dolo, stay away from the po-pos
I smoke a Pink Panther until I go doze
And after that I go powder my nose

(Chorus)
When they be like "What up yo?"
I be like yo "Gloczup!"
When they hit me wit tha "Wassup?"
I'm like whut "Gloczup!"
All my life been gettin' Chedda' never put the chops up
Talk some shit about Detroit and thats how you get shot up
Beotch

Homocidal, Suicidal, my Recital
Enough to take any rapper out they Title
I be the U-N-H-O-L-Y
Toe tag to Body bag make ya momma cry
I fly high in the sky cookin' up a pie
Cross me starin' down the barell lookin' up at I
Never wonder about this life cuz we all gon' die
So I redrum murder without an alibi
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Quick to bust cuz it ain't no fuckin' trust
And I must say kill a Gay Fag dissin'
Spittin' venom on my style you just a snake bitch hissin'
This and that grab the strap
Killin' spillin' ya blood all over ya raps
I'll shoot Dice until his ass get craps
Plus I keep more Macs than fros got naps
Slap yo bitch on the ass
Mash on the gas
Burnin' rubber all up ya block takin' off fast
Carry a concealed weapon incase I gotta blast
In the broad daylight without a ski mask
I see you on the other side
I see you on the other side
I see you on the other side
I be the undisputed rhyme champion of the universe
I spit that Wicked shit my Acid Rap is much worse
This white boy named Eminem say he's live like me
Talkin' about he from Detroit the East Side like me
Talkin' about he don't spit Acid Rap but spit Acid like me
Bitch I'm a Nigga
And you a Honky
