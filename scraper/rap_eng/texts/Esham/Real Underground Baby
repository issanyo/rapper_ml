Underground baby
Real underground baby..

[Violent J]
This clown don't smile and honk your nose
This clown don't wear big goofy clothes
This clown don't mind your hatred for me
You'll get turned into a dead corpse right before me

Real underground baby..

Role model, eat a dick up and swallow
Only model I follow be the Jim Beam bottle
And I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
Full throttle, punchin' in an El Dorado
Full bottle, I care about no tomorrow
When I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall

Who can paint their face up?
(Who can paint their face up?)
And wear a ninja suit?

[Violent J & (Shaggy 2 Dope)]
Floatin' through some backyards
Dropkick your knees in backwards
I'm outtie with a *poof!*
(And ain't that shit the truth!?)

[Violent J]
My days are long and lonely
Black rain is right before me

Real underground baby


My brain does nothing for me
Heyy! This pain'll be my story

But I'm, doin' it because I love it
And I'm, underground baby

Underground, 2 miles deep
