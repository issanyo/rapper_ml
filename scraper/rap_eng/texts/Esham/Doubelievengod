"You're tuned in to the number one group in the area"
"Bang, bang motherfucker, bang, bang huh?"

[Esham]
I never ever believed
I've been deceived like Adam & Eve
My thoughts bust to make my mind bleed
In god you trust, but in god I bust caps
To peel caps and fill bloody naps, bitch
You wanna go to hell or heaven?
I got the 3-5-7 pointed at ya
So you better pray
Before ya life gets takin away
Before the bullet hits ya dome all I have to say
Is do you believe?
Nigga

[Hook]
Do you believe in god? I don't know what this world is comin to {​*repeat 4X*}​

[Esham]
Do you believe in god nigga?
Who is god where is god?
Do you believe in god?
Where is god who is god?

[TNT]
Picked up the bible and burnt my hands
1-8-7 at the church
Dead body needs an ambulance
The unforgettable medication
The masturbation
Premature ejaculation, premeditation
Murder, meditation deep
Niggas sleep so I creep
My crew rolls 6 feet deep
Blaz4me sacrilegious to this religious figure
And I'm the wrong nigga
So do you believe?

[Hook]

[TNT]
Do you believe in god, do you believe in god? {​*repeat 4X*}​

[Esham Talking]
Some might wonder what god is, some say god is man
Some say god is space & time...
I say this

[Mastamind]
Tell me
Do you believe in god?
I'm thinkin' it's odd
I'd rather be dead underground covered in sod
When I walk the earth, walk this way
Leavin you in dismay
There they lay, to stay
You better pray
People dyin outside my town
Homicide surrounds the block
I'm suicide
Where I live both worlds collide
I'mma chop that image of your god up
Only a Reel Life Product can ask you
Do you believe in god?

[Hook]

[Esham]
Do you believe nigga? that's right I said do you believe?
So you believe in god nigga?
So don't ask me, ask yo self, motherfucker motherfucker

[Hook] - repeat until fade
