[VERSE 1: ESHAM]
Sick in the head
So I tried to kill a priest
I'm thinking of excuses
Instead of killing me
The Symptoms of Insanity's got me going psycho
Friday the 13th just like Michael
If I get wreck
Then I wreck when I wreck it
When I mic check
1, 2 when I check it
Looking for excuses just to get ill
How many pigs can one man kill
Many, plenty, all if any
A penny for your thoughts
But death is what you bought
From a public enemy, public figure
Keeping my hands on the trigger
Like a rusty razor but I'll faze you like a taser
Think of Malice Green
And then I get Deja Vu
Then I get voodoo wicket
Slide a rusty razor across your throat then I stick it
Get my man, my man get
Tick-tock-tick when the heater goes click
And by the way, (EDITED) you man
God damn, you better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)

[VERSE 2: ESHAM]
You better murder me man
Before somebody get hurt
Sister Mary do me work in the back of the church
Another one bites the dirt
When I put in work
Heh, you're talking to an expert
The Tazmanian Devil
Black Devil
That Devil you don't know
And don't want to know
Cause I'm kind of like a head hunter, jack
Chop it off and I'm gonna, black
You know I want to, black
Can't no, ain't no if, ands, or buts
When my jimmy swings low
I'm dropping my nuts to the flo'
Onto the flo', to let you know
Pick the hairs off my nuts
Or better yet my afro
Big trigga, cooped up gorilla
And like Ice-T I'm a killa, but illa
Vanilla Ice on the Ku Klux Klan
You better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)

[VERSE 3: ESHAM]
Redrum redrum
Murder murder murder
Standing in my way
Then I got to hurt ya
Never get happy
Hair always nappy
You'll get slapped, G
Unholy pappy
Visions of bloody bodies
Bloody bodies of vision
My mind and suicide
Head on collision
I vision an incision
Some psycho decision
Psychedelic funking
Slam jam dunking
This is do or die
So I'd rather be dead
Catch them out of line
Off with their heads
I flex the text
And break some freaking necks
Me getting done plenty sex
And special effects
Make me crazy, mad, boy I'm freaking bad
You couldn't even add all the problems I've had
Psycho sick, this is sick
Abracadabara, black magic
Voodoo wicket, wicket voodoo
Scare you, go boo
Funky doodoo
I'm wicket, standing with my gat in my hand
You better murder me man

[HOOK]
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
You better murder me man
You better murder me man, you better redrum, redrum (x2)
