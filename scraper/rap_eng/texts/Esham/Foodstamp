Deep in the boondocks where niggas pack Glocks
Everybody tryin' to come up slangin' crack rock
Man made money, no money makes man
Livin' life in the fast lane, short lifespan
Now... I gots to get some dough
Livin' the life of crime's the only life I know
Me and my brother J-A-Y, we do or die
Murder you all with no alibi
For dollaz
It makes me holla
Cash flow gettin' low
Streets dried up, aye, they be movin slow
In this game, such a dirty shame
You know my name
I'm with the rest of the hustlas, fuck the fame

(Hook)
I'm gettin' mail (gettin mail, gettin mail)
X8

They call me UPS, Federal Express
Untouchable nigga, Eliot Ness
Chef Boyardee learned to cook up a KI
Don't get high off your own supply
Went from nigga dreams to havin' C.R.E.A.M
Weight breakin' triple beams
Stare in the eyes of some dope fiends
Amphetamines got my hood on lock down
Jealous-ass niggas won't allow me to put the Glock down
I had to sacrifice my family and friends
Just to clock these ends, rollin in the Benz
It's kinda lonely at the top, but it don't stop
Time to do the flip-flop with the crack rock

(Hook)
