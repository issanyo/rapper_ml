Nervous breakdown
Stress build-up
Um
And I'm paranoid
Schizophrenic
I just think I'm God
I know I'm God
I'm God

I'm stressed out like a mu'fucka, hand on my heata
I told my bitch to get the fuck on, I don't need her
My mind on my money cause it's comin' up short
I just left court on child support
A witness to a murda but I will not tell
Cause most of my niggas in the county jail
Amphetamines make me fiend to stack C.R.E.A.M
Niggas on my team be gone off 'scalene
My hair fallin' out, it's turnin' gray cause I'm stressed
The police want me dead and a warrant for my arrest
I can't do nothin', plus the IRS
Know my telephone numba and my home address
This nigga wanna murda me, the bitches say they hate me
My heart been feelin like it bust on me lately
I'm gone in this muthafucka mind on 'noid
The simple situations in life, I can't avoid
Niggas out the murda me
Cause they never heard of me
America's most playa hated and underrated
Simply stated, niggas hate it, they wanna test
Homie been accused of playa hatin' so confess
Oh my, know why, these niggas hate me so much
It's cause I can't be touched
I'm diabolical sinister
Man I murda ya minister
Witness the narcotic
Reel Life Product

And I'm stressed out
Just gone
Stop steamin and lookin' hard
Stop, stop, stop steamin and lookin' hard
Just gone
Just gone
And I'm stressed out now
Stop steamin and lookin' hard
Stop, stop, stop steamin and lookin' hard

Nervous breakdown got a nigga on creep
My pistol be under my pillow every time I sleep
Niggas wanna see me 6 feet under the earth
I wish I was never, ever born for what it's worth
Now I got a problem, suicidal in every way
I don't even know if I'mma live another day
Seems like everybody against me on the planet
Niggas can't stand it I was born a schizophrenic
I see things with my eyes that ain't there
Knowin' it ain't fair, raised not to care
How could you wanna be me
When nigga you don't know me?
Every day I'm stressed out and unholy
A homicidal, vital recital is what I write
Some suckas get suicidal once I hold a mic
Nigga what?
Muthafucka you know what the rep
Every time they say my name niggas scared to death
My name sparks fear in the hearts of punks and hoes
Resurrect my intellect and I arose
Suppose you knew how I was you wouldn't guess
I need professional help because I'm stressed

Stressed the fuck out
