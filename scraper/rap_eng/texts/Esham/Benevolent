Benevolent
I feel benevolent
Benevolent
I feel benevolent
Benevolent
I feel benevolent
Benevolent
I feel benevolent

Perfectin’ my thoughts
Tryin’ not to come across as a bitch
Or a punk ass nigga that’s rich
Never switch
The game is fucked, good luck
If you got in it yesterday
Get you a life insurance policy
'cuz you bound to see the cemetery
And get a gun
'cuz in this game, it’s necessary
And never run or act like you in a hurry
You’ll be judged by six or six [?]
In my six on the block at 6 o’clock
Already know what time it is
So I don’t wear a watch
Police try to keep they eye on me like a cyclops
But they gotta look up in the air 'cuz I sky hops
No fly zone, if yo crash lands on my block
Your feet catch fire 'cuz the ground hot
AK-47, slug in the round hot

We got guns, guns, guns for fun
This America, boy, you ain’t the only one wit' one
Guns, guns, guns for fun
This America, boy, you ain’t the only one wit' one
You better go get one if you ain’t got one
I fell in love wit’ it the first time I shot one
Piggity pop when I think I’m gonna drop one
Somebody hear the shot sounds and the cops come

Guns don’t kill people, people kill people
Guns save lives cuz it’s good vs. evil
Heroin plus elephant tranquilizers, helephant
Must be the way I feel right now, benelovent
Without my gun, I’d feel irrelevant
It’s still some drug dealer out here sellin’ it
It’s still some dope fiend out here tryin’ it
They keep dying’ and they still buyin’ it
How can we win, in this world of sin?
I was tryin’ not to kill again, I’m feeling trapped like Gilligan
People robbin’, pillagin’ and purgin’ on your privileges
Livin’ through injustices, America’s an idiot
Idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot
