Let's take a trip, back into time, as I explain
Things ain't the same, I'm goin' back down memory lane
And as I travel, dirt roads of gravel
Two sets of foot prints for me and my shadow
The Unholy speaks as I walk in my sleep
And my speech makes you weak
Means my words are deep
You see society's sprung on a Bible and a man
With the will of the devil to destroy and he can
You see, time after time, have I made up my mind
Should I be a vegetarian or die eating swine
Can I lose my religion, every day, it's a habit
Is religion just for kids or am I a silly rabbit?
Am I lost in a book that says sins are forbidden
Who am I to believe when the Bible was really written?
I don't know, will I die?
I can't live in a lie
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'm losin my religion

Am I wrong or insane, using God's name in vain
When the preacher sells cocaine, how am I to be sane
You see first he's a preacher, now he's slangin' ki's
College educated from workin' at Mickey D's
I got no say in the world today
Livin' in AmeriKKK
You call me the devil 'cause I refuse to pray
But your religious games I refuse to play
Bible study's not my buddy
Shake the preacher, now my hand's all bloody
Daily gossip, religious philosophies
Nigga please, I'm losin my religion
