(Esham Talking)
Deadly shadows, so uh
You afraid of the dark?
Deadly shadows, in the dark in the dark
In the dark
Shadows, shadows
Gotta watch yaself out here boy

I be the icon, Autobahn, named Esham
Another victim wanna get some infrared.com
Who's your idle suicidal recital never take my title
Cuz what I know, crows never seen like a shadow
In a battle, my head move like a snake and my tail rattle
All those with beef get mutilated like dead cattle
Finally hearing true confessions and murder lessons
I keep the Smith & Wesson for the traitor steady stressin
Life's a bitch when I spit internet watch the glitch
I'm deadly as the virus that you don't wanna get
Wicked shit is all I hear
New year, I'm nuclear
Buried alive in a pine box is my deepest fear
Solar systems should be hidden
Like green leaves and green trees
Don't make me walk the waters across the seven seas
The serpent and the rainbow
The cocaine flow
The forbidden fruit telling you not to bite or I'll shoot

(Chorus 4x, repeats I'll Shoot 3 times)
Wicked entities with ya
Don't let the sun hit ya
In ya head you might picture
How your shadow's gonna get ya

When doves fly thugs cry
So you can't deny
When tears fall from your eyes
Up your soul to the sky
The fallen angel u-n-h-o-l-y
Hell I be helluva hellified
Cuz Detroit be suicide
In the darkness
Straight out the abyss
Spark the cannabis
No mercy for the weak mind not understanding this
Hardcore, or you're gonna die
Cuz I got the body armor I declare war for
The punk mutherfuckers
Biting every lyric
Full clips of hollow tips to release your holy spirit
Your unoriginal, artificial
Flavor tampering
If ya style was strach n sniff it would smell like dirty Pampers
Cuz you got clap
You heard a round of applause
Deadly shadows in the back when you break rap laws

(Chorus 4x, repeats when you break rap laws 3x)
