[HOOK]
How I need eternal rest
Help me through my mental stress (my mental stress)
(x4)

[VERSE 1]
See I've been to Hell and back
And that's a fact
I get a flashback one day I'm a snack
My mind is gone
To each his own
I wish the police would just leave me alone
I want to die
I do not die
I'm on the far side and it's passin' me by
I want to cry
I do not cry
I have to tell me, myself, and I
And who am I
I don't understand
I cop a kilo from a Colombian
Black man, my man, man
God damn man, oh man, man
It's a hit, tell me something I don't know
No hope, and I can't cope
With the mental stress

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
Life ain't nothing but bullets, man
And squeeze that trigger if the gun's in hand
(What trigger?) This trigger
(What trigger?) That trigger
(What trigger?) This trigger, finger on the trigger
(Oh no, what you going to do now boy?)
I'm fixing to go nuts like an Almond Joy
Bang my head against the wall
Three times until it bleeds
Wicket Witch of the East
The belly of the beast
See, that's just how it be
Nobody really gives a damn about me
And you see
That I ain't got no hope
Somebody help me cope
With my mental stress

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
You gotta lock me up and throw away the key
God took my mind and said bucj me
I kick the Wicket hit until I can't no more
I black out so much I can't think no more
'Til I die, 'til I die
Wonder will I die
How you plead to homicide without an alibi
No lie, I can't wait 'til I die
Bitches still think Heaven's up in the sky
And voices in my head call my name at night
Sometimes I don't know wrong from right
Insight, Twilight Zone's my home
I put the chrome to my dome when I'm all alone
By my lonely, I'm going to join my dead homie
No hope, and I can't cope
With the mental stress

[HOOK]
