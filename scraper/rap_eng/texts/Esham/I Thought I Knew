I thought you knew, but it seems you dont
So now I gotta put you in yo place cuz most niggas won't, give you all a piece of my mind
The truth will set you free and the truth is hard to find
Had a little hoe, she loved to wine n dine her favorite number 69 so is mine
In those times a nigga felt good, in the sunshine I misunderstood
Many hoes many hoes, I ran through plenty hoes plenty hoes
Call me a pimp or a mac dad, or call me a Mr. propalk dad
Its a toss up if my homies fell through, see I shouldn't have to tell you I thought you knew
I thought you know about the unholy black devil
Dick in my hand to let you know where i stand
Im with my man, wit the 40 in hiz hand
I can't trust the cops cuz they the klu klux klan
Mo-town all the real niggas know the radio try to play me like a hoe
Just cuz I won't criss cross over to the pop, just cuz I got a lil problem wit the cops
Props come and the radio go, but I ain't nobodys hoe
I thought you knew
I thought you know about a nigga like me I'm just into clocking cash but some niggas clocking me
They still dont know the time all on my line just cuz I'm fucking your womans mind
I gotta get my roll on, I gotta get my stroll on I gotta get em on
And once its on I'm feelin alright
I think ima might fuck your woman tonight
Cuz I dont care, I dont give a fuck about how shes kissin your baby and how shes suckin my nuts
I fucked her in the but like yesterday
What? I ain't got nuthin else to say
I thought you knew
