No game, nothing but big thangs
Big, big thangs, big, big thangs
Esham and J Dilla, 2012
Big thangs

Big thangs, get skrilla
Esham and J Dilla
Black and yellow, you a Pittsburgh Steeler
Blue and orange, I'm a Detroit tiger killer
From the east side, don't get no realer
Gas price is high, I still fill up
Big thangs, whole bird break you off a chicken wing
Old school, new Jack Swang
Biggy, Biggy, spiggy off the higgy
Smelling like the izzy, they like he be getting bizy
Girlies dig me, flier than a frizbee
Top floor penthouse, my attire crispycrispy
The altitude alone made your hottie dizzy
The breath taking views made her wanna kiss me
Slow down, baby, whole lot of honeys here
And let's make this clear, I'm tryna get this money here
Big thangs, sick thangs
Know I'm not a slave so I don't rock chains

Nothing but big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs, no games

No games, big thangs in the holsterhost up
I got the big bread with the big toastertoast up
Big drummazilla, big Mama-Dilla
Threw the old house shoes out and got some new slippers
Big talk, big walk to the bank now
I'm so much the shit, they call me big stank now
Hey you, little pooh, what's your little loot poo
You're like a little dude shooting on a little hoop
That's my house on top of the big hill
I got a green machine and a big wheel
Yeah girl, I'm kinda like a big deal
Esham and Dilla on the track, equal big bills (for real)
You don't like that, big problem
Come to Detroit and meet the big goblin
So close your big mouth, you don't know what big 'bout
Big guns, equal big clout
Big faces, big head up
Me and J Dilla 'bout to wake the dead up

Nothing but big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs

Big bank account, big money
I'm Fred Sanford you Lamont, big dummy
Big toys, big noise
Only way you do it big is working up at Big Boy's
And the big body with the big butt hottie
Big extra size, doing Pilates
Big lost to the game now that dealer's gone
Yeah, your butt big, but it's silicone
Big fake ass like a lot of these emcees
He's alright but he's not me
Lyrically, I'm B.I.G
You got the big ego, I got the big desert eagle
What I say, so don't you spit it, it's illegal
Big payback, big since way back
Put a big head out, big contract
Big brother's watching if you big dollar clocking
And the industry's still big cock blocking
But ain't no way to stop these fiends from knocking

Nothing but big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs
Big, big thangs
Big thangs
[Esham an J Dilla]
