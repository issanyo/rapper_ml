(Chorus) (Mastamind)

Can i, rest in peace when i die?

(Thinkin' will i live, thinkin' thinkin' will i live, thinkin' thinkin' will i
Live, another 24? -Ice Cube)

(Verse 1: Mastamind)

Can i, rest in peace when i die?
FUCK the world, (inaudible: die), go to hell then i fry!
To die, let the Devil take my soul from me, am i just a crash test dummy, riskin' life for bloody money?
Selfish crimes, i know we all got some evil minds, but i'm not afraid to admit it!
I'm wicked, and real life i live, but i can't live life, i'm still thinkin' about the night i lost my nigga in a gun fight!
Still got these killers after me, if that's the way it has to be, listen to my gun scream Blaz4me!
Why must i live by an eye for an eye, it won't be long, can i rest in peace when i die?

(Chorus: Mastamind)

Can i, rest in peace when i die?

(Thinkin' thinkin' will i live, another 24? -Ice Cube)

(Verse 2: Mastamind)

You was born in the ghetto, you gon' die in the ghetto! They stressin' some shit about me being a ghetto devil!
Tryna twist my head up 'til i get fed up and croak, murder one is all i wrote, in my last suicide note!
Can't go with mental stress, can't pass the mental test, keep my name out your mouth, when i'm dead is my last request!
Life after death, what's it worth?, what's it worth?, when i leave this Earth would you run my name through the dirt?
Why can't i be, just a memory, hope my death ain't no mystery, who the FUCK took my misery? If i, can't keep this bullshit deceased when i'm alive, can i rest in peace when i die?
Damn...

(Chorus: Mastamind)

Can i, rest in peace when i die?
