I know you hate me bitch
Cause I ain't rich
And I'm tryin to get mine
Fuckin with my mind
And I know you don't mind
What's yours is mine
And what's mine is mine
Let me do some time
If I find you switch
Then I gotta slap you
Bitch bitch, suck my dick
Till the funk in my trunk
That I packed to the mack
Play back, play back, spit it back
Rude boy, roughneck white duck
9 dead bodies then my bitch turns up
Lately you've been trying to play me
In a mental state G
Wait G

(Chorus X2)

I know you hate me
I know you hate me
I know you hate me
Bitch

I know you hate me hoe
You still can't let it go
]From a long time ago
Hey yo
Bitch take a check before you get ship wrecked
And I snap your fuckin neck
I ain't had em dat
Bitch, hoe, stank booty freak
Nuts in your mouth
Stretch marks on your cheeks
Ya say I ain't the same
Ya say I'm actin strange
Well bitch I'm still the same motherfuckin insane
I'm crazy like a wannabe
I'll shut your fuckin mouth up
Jump on ya stomach till ya cough ya fuckin lunch up
(Esham argues with his old girlfriend)

(Chorus X2)

I know you hate me
To be or not to be a bitch
A bitch, why you gotta be a bitch
Dumb hoe, workin on an ass kickin
Get yo ass in the kitchen and cook this chicken
Bitch or I'll slap you upside the head
Hoe have you ever seen a burnin bed
I ain't playin
Know what I'm sayin
Hoe you better act right
I ain't against fuck you up like a street fight
All in all in I think you've fallen
911 bitch get the call in the cops
Or better yet call homicide
Cause somebody in here just died

(Chorus X2)

I know you hate me

(Chorus X2)

I know you hate
I know you hate me
I know you hate
I know you hate me

I know you hate me!
