Is there anybody out there?
Esham and Twiztid
Twiztid!
Who thought it'd happen?
That's right bitch

[Hook]
Look at me! Look at me!
Come on dogg, I see you starrin'
Look at me! Look at me!
Is it the clothes you see me wearrin'?
Look at me! Look at me!
Is it them twenty-fours glarrin'?
Look at me! Look at me!
You know I just ain't carrin'

[Verse 1 - Esham]
Look at me, I'm from the 3-1-3
E-A-S-T-S-I-D-E
Who's the number one cheddar boy in the city?
Attitude shitty, sniffin' coke off bitches titties
You never thought that I'd be runnin wit the hatchet
Who runs Detroit? Esham and Kill Patrick
I can't forget about the Wicked Clownz and Psychopathic
And if you got static, I'm whippin out the automatic

[Verse 2 - Jamie Madrox]
I'm swinging for your esophogus
You gon' look at me or I'mma get to palmin' the world just like I was
Apocolypse
With that destructive and malicious look in my eyes
Me, Mono, Blaze, and Esham who wanna die?

[Verse 3 - Monoxide]
Fuck it y'all, I've been fuckin' with black magic
Now I'm standin' in the middle of Gratiot yellin' at the passing traffic
Nothing to laugh at, but I'm something to see
I spit fire, you can see my tounge blaze when I breathe
Look at me! Monoxide!

[Jamie Madrox]
Jamie Madrox! Soda pop rocks

[Esham]
Esham! Wicked shit boomin' out spots!


[Verse 4 - Esham]
Look at me, my life and times what they took from me
They overlooked me, the judge threw the book at me
Look at me, all blue Detroit hat
Suspect cause I'm driving while black

[Hook] -x2
Look at me! Look at me!
Come on dogg, I see you starrin'
Look at me! Look at me!
Is it the clothes you see me wearrin'?
Look at me! Look at me!
Is it them twenty-fours glarrin'?
Look at me! Look at me!
You know I just ain't carrin'
