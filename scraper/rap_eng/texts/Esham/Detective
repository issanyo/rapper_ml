(Esham)
I got a ill case, paranoia blood stains on my face
Close range sawed off shotgun bust
I never trust, it's a must you ain't down with us
From Gotham to Metropolis, nigga ain't no stoppin' us
Suicidal tendencies, fuck all my enemies
From aggravated assault, insurance is no fault
U-N-H-O-L-Y, murder's my lullaby
Sodomize your trick and make her recognize. bitch
So fresh it's ridiculous, merciless, meticulous
Some back in New York and Los A-N-G-E-L-E-S
A homicidal vital recital, Esham's my title
From stacks of heroin packs, I went suicidal
From symptoms of insanity slowly slippin' insane
Doin' 100 in my 850 in the rain
And I got retaliation on the brain

(Moebadis)
Retaliation's a must, when I bust
Who the fuck can we trust?
For all you niggas that ain't down
With the Reel Life Product
No time to contemplate I'm grabbin' that AK
Niggas in your hood screamin' out mayday, mayday
It's that killa, Moebadis
Kickin' you niggas and hoes, cause to me you on the same status
A rhyme apparatus, come get your head splattered
That's why in Detroit they call me Moebadis

(Mastamind)
Let the gat flow, let that weed grow
Don't let 'cha vehicle ride through the wrong hood
Cause bitch, we evil
I rained on a million people, drowned the world in my shit
Blaze the blunt, and shoot, blow this motherfucker to bits

(TNT)
Tony Montana, I shot up a body in Atlanta
Dump that bitch in the river it don't matter
Still make moves on the street and don't stop
Still got the connects for the guns and crack rock
Niggas hate...
