I don't give a fuck boy, I'm comin' like a maniac
Bitch, you better ask somebody, nigga, you remember that
See, I'm a bad muhfucka with a pocket full of money
Mean mug on my face, nigga, ain't shit funny
From the D-E-T-R-O-I-T
Get a OZ, some gan & some Hennessey
You might see me on 7-Mile bumpin' the beat
With a big-booty freak in the passenger seat
If I wasn't slangin' raps I'd be slangin' the crack
But fuck that shit, it ain't about all that
See, I get money, money I got
Hoes call me honey, they feel real hot
Don't ever let me hear you say I ain't debonaire
I'm better than any young nigga out there
When I'm rockin' the mic hoes stop and stare
At the nigga on stage with the nappy hair

(Chorus)
To drug dealers, and cap peelers, and big wheelers
Can ya feel me?

I don't give a fuck boy, I'm gone off hydro
Can't nobody fuck with a nigga with a calico
If you think you can bring it on to the slaughter
I'm lookin' for that nigga who beat me fo' that quarter
Yeah, this NATAS, nigga, yeah, I'm wicked
Yeah, I'm gettin' paid and nah, we ain't gon' kick it
Fuck yo punk ass, booty kissin' bitches I'm dissin'
A nigga gettin' mail, so who you gon' tell?
If I sell you an 8th you gon' tell the police
They just wanna see me in the belly of the beast
I wish a young nigga could just find peace
In a life without worry and safe from these streets
People live life in the story untold
A nigga just want a fat knot to fold
You get life, no parole, for the dope I hold
A millionaire nigga still livin' out cold
