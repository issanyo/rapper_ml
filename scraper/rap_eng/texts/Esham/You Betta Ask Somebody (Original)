All of Detroit City!
This is for all them big nut niggas in Detroit
I know you riding high boy, I know you riding high

[Verse 1]
I'm ice skating through my city, 500 dropped
Just got a fresh fade from the barber shop
Gonna pick up my nigga, we gonna hit the strip
Got the 3-5-7 just in case we trip
Might get a little drunk, might smoke some weed
If we fuck with some hoes that's all we need
I'm a real ass nigga and never fake
If you feel like me nigga, pump your brakes
See I made this shit for the niggas who roll
Tight like Tony Montana, out control
From the D-E-T-R-O-I-T
Can't no nigga out there fuck with me
I'm getting mail, fuck a jail cell, post bail
Esham getting paid, who you gonna tell
Wit' yo punk ass, I blast
Any motherfucker running up in a ski mask
Never outdone, only outdoing
Titty bar bitches is the hoes I'm screwing
Why, cause all my niggas did
Cause they're addicted
To selling iieiio, and yelling hey ho
If you don't know, I think you better go
Ask somebody about a real nigga ho, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't just talk when it comes to making my snaps
Cause I was slanging rocks way before all the raps
On the corner slanging dimes
Fuck the rhymes
Young nigga came up through the hard times
I'm a 7-mile riding, Benz gliding
Big bluntin', ain't no future in yo' frontin'
From the fall of the Best Friends, Y.B.I
Now niggas in my city like do or die
All I do is smoke weed and fuck these hoes
Have them waiting by the phone hoping they get chose
All you punk ass niggas be player hating
Cause I'm making this money, straight regulating
And you be illegit, all counterfeit
Ain't about no business, all about bullshit
Get your shit together
Stop riding on the next nigga's dick
And loving these tricks
It all started as a toddler
.45 bullet swallower
Dope  dealer, footstep follower
Slang  an O-Z, cause niggas want to know me
Bitch, mind your business, cause you're nosy
I'm thinking how can I come up on the 8 feet
I never let the money get a chance to get away from me
Street politicking, hoodrat dick sticking
Call me Colonel Sanders cause I got the fried chickens
Ill life wicket ways make me real trife
I bring the thought up it's all about Reel Life

[Hook]

[Outro:  Zelah Williams]
You better ask somebody, if you don't know
