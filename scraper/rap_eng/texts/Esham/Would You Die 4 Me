Closed Casket
Would You Die 4 Me

"Original style, original bad boy style, hear me"

I know a freak, I used to put my mack down on her
I used to boner her, make the other niggas want her
So Mona, that was the trick name
She's a sick dame, cold caught up in the dick game
I'm not a wimp, never simp like a simp
I'm a pimp with the limp so I pimp, put my mack down
Much juice, used to fuck her back in nine-duece
Her moms was crackin, my bank was stackin
I'm mackin, ain't no slackin I'm Cadillacin
No love for this ho cause this pimp stayed solo
She jockin 24/7 it's hard to shake her off
Some poppa his brother so I'ma break her off
She had a bad habit of sayin she loved me
If I was broke she wouldn't be thinkin of me
I said fuck it baby must be sellin stress
And I ain't with the stress she got the slug in the chest
She tried to get her pussy wet with the skins
But that ain't how I'm layin with the state of mind I'm in
I had to run a check on this hoe
And then let me see, if the bitch'll die for me

(CHORUS)
Once upon a time
Once once upon a time
Once once upon a time
Once once upon a time

Lesson 1:
That girl in the blue dress
Opened my mouth and I tasted a woman for the first time

I said I wanna hoe that'll give me the world
Don't try to juice me up like I was a jheri curl
I got no fuckin time for your little sillyness
Either you down or you ain't really ness
I need a bitch that'll die for a nigga
That'll cry for a nigga, that don't like to a nigga
She said she loved me and she never wanna let me go
I said back up off these nuts and don't sweat me ho
I don't really think you know what you in for
I ain't your ordinary nigga from the ghetto
I never loved, never liked
I treat a hoe like a dyke, until she get my game down right
She shed a tear and said she never wanna let me leave
And there ain't nothin that can come between you and me
I said nothin till death do us part
Well if this niggas truly in your heart, would you die for me?

(CHORUS)

Lesson 2: they never loved you
They never loved you
They never loved you, you were just a toy

A couple months went past and now we rollin real
And I gots my trick like David Copperfield
But my tricks gettin sick in the mornin
Growin up and blowin up
I told this bitch, yo, somethins gotta go
I had to inform her like that white boy snow
She said what you want me to do? You know he needs us
I said Jesus, told me to kill the fetus
And if you got any problems wit it
You can leave it outside and let the garbage man come and get it
I left the room a, I heard a boom
She shot herself in the stomach, I start to vomit
She fell to her knees all bloody
Bleedin nutty, hoe buddy
She said look at what you made me do
I love you man, and I'd die for you

(CHORUS)

"I've been asked after witnessing this God-awful
Misery for the last 17 years if I've finally gotten
Used to this.  Used to this after the human being
Eyes, and Ears, and Heart, get used to this."
