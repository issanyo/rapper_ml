[Chorus 4x]
Pop, pop
Piggity
Pop, pop, pop, pop


[Mastamind]
Can you hear my battle cry
Can you look me in the eye
Did you feel the heat
When I let these caps crackle in the sky
Don't get caught in the blood shower
Don't die as no coward
The night is mine
Cause I was born in the midnight hour
Never shoulda let my hate
For this world develop, see
Now I gives less than a fuck
It's time to raise the hell up
Gun blast piggity (pop, pop, pop)
Crash the deck
It's the season of the head hunter
Chop! Chop! Head check
Hypochondriac insomniac
I'm reaching in my nutsack
Nigga fuck that bust at me
I bust back
Once I get out this coma
Come up out this meditation
I'mma start chasing niggas down with retaliation
N to the A-T-A-S
Back up in this bitch, hell yes
What you hearing ain't no fucking test
Just so say farewell to the flesh, I just
Body count 'em down two into one
Cause murders fun
My shotgun said freeze 'em till he's numb

[Chorus 4x]

[T-N-T]
Pop, pop, piggity, pop, pop
I don't give a fuck if you a motherfucking cop
What's up now nigga?
Finger on the trigger
Boom, boom, gravedigger
Body bag zipper
You ain't shit
Bitch you gon' die
Made my mama cry
You murdered my brother, why?
Seen's ya in the squad car
Pop that bitch up
Bullets went through yo chest
Now doctors can't stitch you up
I'm coming to the hospital
Critical condition
I know you on life support
So now I'm on a mission
Grab the ski mask and the foe foe mag
Nigga I won't rest until you pissin in a bag
You killed my brother
And now I'm gonna kill you
He won't rest in peace until these slugs fill you
Room 212
I'm sending yo ass to hell
Popped him in the head
And watched his body turn pale

[Chorus 4x]

[Esham]
Pop the pill, cock the steel
I got the skills to kill
I'm from Detroit like Grant Hill
You all alone nigga
Tonight it's on nigga
I got the chrome
And I'm busting fo' your dome, nigga
Pop, pop, pop, nigga pop so you
Drop, drop, drop, nigga drop got that
Blood clot, hole in yo head
Chatty ass nigga
I'll be glad when you dead
Once I get to squeezin
And my reason's a revolver
My problem solver
So tell your mama sayonara
Wada, da dang
Wad, da, da, da, dang, hey
Listen to my Glock go pop, pop, and I like that
The way your blood be spilling up
Gushing up on the concrete so fast
Never let me see you slipping
Cause I'm down to blast in your ass
And I got that Glock cocked
With my finger on the trigger right now
And I know my homie woulda done the same for me
So now I must pow

(Chorus x4)
