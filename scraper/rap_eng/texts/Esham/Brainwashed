[VERSE 1]
Now I lay me down to sleep before I go to bed
13 ways why yo' ass should be dead
I used to love this ho but she went and fucked my boy
Now I'm fucked up fo' real, still
This is the real Mccoy
I try to tell myself that it'll be alright
I try to tell myself that it'll be alright
I try to tell myself that it'll be alright
But once my mind starts clickin' then I'm losin' the fight
Because

[HOOK]
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away

[VERSE 2]
Now who's that nigga gettin' brainwashed
Never, ho
I'm too clever, ho
But whenever yo
Ass want to play silly games wit' a true blue
Up for the down stroke
Kickin' that voodoo
I never had a ho I could call my own
I only had hoes who loved to bone
Every nigga in the crew who didn't screw
This bitch I knew
I guess she knew that she was

[HOOK]
Brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away

[VERSE 3]
I'm losin' my mind
Goin' insane like Kurt Cobain
Blowin' out my brains for a dame
It's the same ol' same
Everybody knows the 411
Call 911 'cause he's got a gun
Now who's laughin' bitch
Lets walk the flatlines once the hammer clicks
If it sticks, then I got a 666
And 'til death do us part
I'll be sick, 'cause

[HOOK]
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
I'm gettin' brainwashed like every day
I'd rather be dead than fade away
