Silence of the hams squeal pigs
Split they wigs
Mr. bigs
This is gonna flip they lids
Screw you f**king bitch

Now me tell you something about my side of town
Pork chops get sauteed so they don't f**k around
You have the right to remain silent
I plead the 4 5th flip the script on the bitch and get violent

And we high on Mary Jane enphadamies
Cutting they ears off ten year sergeant veterans
I'm like a young pig skinna from the H.O.K
Ain't no way we ain't gonna spray away
4 Killas and a Lapro? Ham
We staying ice out like the abdominal snowman
Ain't no man no ham no goddamn coppa gonna drop me
I'll pop em with the heart stopper

Silence of the hams is what I burst
But first
Let me tell you what's worst
October 31st
Bloody Halloweens
Screams and police sirens
Rapid firing my auto mattic pistol
I pop Chris
And I pop crystals
Shootin' off my missiles at police cars
Right out side your local tittie bars
These wicked stars

It's the silence of the hams and you lookin' hammy (uh-oh)
Sawed off pistol grip and I Glock click bammy (pow)
Oooooh ride with me and drop a coppa (bacon bits) (oh ya)
Brake out with the trumpet service something proper proper

So silence of the hams
Clint East I smell your cut
Lets talk about it over a watermelon blunt
Hannibal cannibal ate a cop for lunch
And chewed on his badge like some captain crunch
APB out on the juggalo
ICP and 3 insane search through the 313
You can't protect or serve me
Matter of fact ,you work for me

You fired faggot, F**K THAT!

Me and D and T and E and Shaggy 2 Dope
Rear rear f**k that buck pat dun dun dun dun
Psychopathic hatchets swinging catching a flinging bloody bacon
Body dropping bitches singing preacher preaching f**kin faking
Booty heavy bitches waiting back at my house
I be anticipatin' putting dick in they mouth
Ain't no f**kin cop about to raid on my parade
When I been dreaming about killing a cop from 2nd grade

P-o-l-i-c-e me
Homi-c-i-d-e
You don't wanna see me
Red and blue lights talking on the CB
Luitenant and a rookie
Damn I gotta cookie
All through my shit they wanna take a extra lookie
Probably wanna book me
Off to jail they took me
I know I'm looking at alot of time without some nookie
Ehehehehehh

It's the silence of the hams and you lookin' hammy (uh-oh)
Sawed off pistol grip and I Glock click bammy (pow)
Oooooh ride with me and drop a coppa (bacon bits) (oh ya)
Brake out with the trumpet service something proper proper

Boom boom boom (Switch)
Boom "Who the f**k is that?" It's E & J, Bitch
I don't give a f**k if you rap you gets no love
You can wrap your lips around my dick and suck faggot, what?
We getting wicked hallowicked when we kick it
Bring the pickit sign
Wicked rhyme d-time
It's raining diamonds
The sixth joker's card is in your front yard
Bitch don't be sccccured

It's the silence of the hams and you lookin' hammy (Cop killaz, police killaz)
Sawed off pistol grip and I Glock click bammy (pow) (muthaf**ka don't test me)
Oooooh ride with me and drop a coppa (bacon bits) (oh ya)
Brake out with the trumpet service something proper proper (Insane Clown Posse and Esham)
