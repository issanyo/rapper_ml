[Chorus]
All of my life
I need a husband, boy, you need a wife
And so let's make it right
I'm through with the thuggin' and the hangin all night
Oh baby, all of my life
I need a husband, boy, you need a wife
And so let's make it right
I'm through with the thuggin' and the hangin all night
Oh baby, all of my life

[Esham]
All of my life
I been searchin the whole world for someone like you
To maybe have a daughter or a son that look like you
If I was true and you was true and we was true together
Well then there's nothin in this world we couldn't do together
We went to school together plus we looked so cool together
They see us out there, they be like "Them two still together?"
No matter the weather, broken wings, you patch my feathers
And that's why it's always heavenly forever

[Chorus]

[Esham]
Let me tell you, girl, I'll never sell you, girl
Your heart's made out of glass, I won't drop your world
So precious as a pearl
I know I put you through some things that made you wanna cry, girl
But you stood by, girl
Girl, I need ya nose bleed if I leave ya
I love the way you rock my boat like Aaliyah
I can't wait to see ya, pull up in ya two seater
Drop-top, showin off ya smile wit a knock-knock

[Chorus]

[Esham]
I'm through with runnin the streets, my gun in my reach
I'm through with hangin all night; drinkin liquor ain't right
I just might wind up in the hospital
For bein irresponsible, the worst
I'm through with puttin everything first
I'm through with everything

Together...Father forgive me...for all my sins...I repent
