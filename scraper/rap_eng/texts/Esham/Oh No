[Hook] -x2
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back now!
Holdin' me back now!

[Verse 1]
Oh no motherfucker, suck up that lip
Because I'm back in this bitch and I'm ready to trip
So I hope you never doubted me, cause here I am
Packed in ya ear drum like a can of spam
And I wouldn't give a damn if you hated me now
Because my family hears me out and bumps this shit out loud
You can call us psycho, crazy, insane
With no one to blame, so we just sit in the rain
Waitin' for the right day to get what we deserve
Like respect from the cops on the curb at the concert
Nice titties, my oh my
But when the tear gas fire, you better close your eyes
Every time a new adventure, punch a horse in the face
Smoke a blunt in the forest while you piss in the lake
Situations fucked up, fun and foul
But it's a whole new year so try and stop me now

[Hook] -x2
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back now!
Holdin' me back now!

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in what you do?
Don't stop, don't let no one hold you
Back from what you really wanna do
Besides in this life all you got is you
Keep your heart clear (Keep your heart clear)
Don't let go..go..go.. so emotional
Believe me, I know!

[Hook] -x2
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back now!
Holdin' me back now!

[Verse 3]
You can't hold me back, because I'm comin' full throttle
Hand on my hatchet, who wanna see a head bobble?
I see my streets, like it's a native warfield
And I'm the only redskin left, standin' with no shield
So I started to chop cause I can't stop
It's looking too peaceful up there on the top
So I'm, doin' everything that I must
Even if I gotta bust the ones I can't trust

[Break]
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back!
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me from takin' what's mine!
(You can't stop me! you can't stop me! you can't stop me!)
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back!
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me from takin' what's mine!
(You can't stop me! you can't stop me! you can't stop me!)

[Hook] - Repeat Until End
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back now!
Holdin' me back now!
