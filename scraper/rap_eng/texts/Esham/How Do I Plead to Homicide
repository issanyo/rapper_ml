[VERSE 1]
Six in the morning
Police at my door
Dead body on the floor
From the night before
I caught a murder rap
'Cause I busted a cap in the whore
Left her body stinking on the bathroom floor
Out the back door
Cops seen who done it
One homicide
Now one man's wanted
APB, 187 suspect's on the flee
Six in the morning
It's a homi-C-I-D-E
They said her body's mutilated
Can't get an I.D
'Cause I shot her in the face
And took a hammer and busted out her teeth
Now I'm the run with a gun and a sledge hammer
Thinking to myself, "I'll be damned if I'm in the slammer."
Ran down a dead end street
Here comes the heat
Next thing you know I got my face in the concrete
Now I got a court date
On my way Upstate
Prosecuting attorney waiting for my fate
Thirty questions are asked
And thirty answers are lies
And as the judge and jury looks on
How do I plead to homicide

[SAMPLES]

[VERSE 2]
As I approached the bench
My shackles dragged across the floor
("Where were you on the night in question?")
"At the liqour store."
They wanted me to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth
I'll tell the truth only if you got proof
They ask me this, they ask me that
Then they switch the stuff up
And ask the same shit right back
But I got my shit together
I'm too clever
("Have you ever worshipped the devil?")
"No! Never!"
I said it once, I said it twice, I said it three times
Then they pulled my file and found all sorts of crimes
The victim's parents said the cops should have killed me
They asked me how do I plead
I said not guilty
They're getting angry
They wanna hang me
They called me the Devil
And threw holy water on me
Order in the court
It's getting out of hand
They got an eyewitness and she's about to take the stand
Now I start to panic
The truth and lies collide
How do I plead to homicide

[SAMPLES]

[VERSE 3]
The eyewitness took the stand
She said she saw me burning candles
Then she heard a shot
In my hand was the hammer's handle
She seen blood and guts and called the cops soon
And when they came
Brain fragments all over the room
The judge and jury looking at me like guilty
Then one jumped up and said
("Lock up the filthy bastard!")
I'm like damn
Can I get a Goddamn break
How much shit can one black man take
But the judge was black and the jury too
All of them looking at you know who
They asked me why did I do it
I said, "Fuck you!"
Show me a throat
And I'm going to cut through
They said the killing was a Satanic ritual
Then they called me a sick individual
I dropped my head and tried to plead insanity
("Your Honor as you can see, he's a threat to humanity.")
With no emotion in my face I saw her family cry
And since I'm guilty
That's how I'm pleading to homicide
