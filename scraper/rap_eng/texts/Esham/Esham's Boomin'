[INTRO]
Yo man, let me get one of them big motherfuckers and shit in there
(All right man, here you go man, give me the money man, give me the money)
That one, man
(Hey fuck that you don't get no damn choice, get the rock and get the fuck on!)

[VERSE 1]
Sitting down in a crackhouse earning my pay
If some basehead jump crazy I'll just blow him away
Cause I'm fully wrapped
I ain't taking crap
I got a Mini-14 with a shoulder strap
Baseheads had knocked on the door
They just knocked and knocked
My crack quickly disappeared one rock by rock
I had a couple more to go
But oh no here comes The Big 4
Busting down the door, so
I kicked out a window, jumped the roof next door
Took the money left the crack, but I'll get more
Jumped down off the roof
Cops start popping
All yelling "Freeze!"; who they thought was stopping
Cops on my tail trying to put me in jail
I slipped and I fell, got up and ran like Hell
I was running and running
Running fast as I can
If you'd have seen me you'd have said "that's The Bionic Man"
Yeah I was gone
This brother had got away
Cause up the block was my homeboy's hideaway
Banged on the door, he let me into his crib
Then I told him about the police and what they did
He gave the keys to his ride and I was back on the move
Jumped into his 'Vette and kicked "The Groove"
You see, crime is life, and life is crime
But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme
Not real life

[VERSE 2]
Cruising 'round town and the bass is up
Running big time lights, I don't give a fuck
Seen the police, put the pedal to the metal
The pigs was on my tail because the speakers rocked the ghetto
I knew they was suspicious cause this 'Vette was moving fast
They're not going to get me unless they pop my ass
Burned big time rubber on 7 Mile
I was driving like a drunk, cold acting wild
Slammed on the brakes, pressed on the gas
Dipped around a corner, cold lost their ass
Bust a move to my crib to change my clothes
And since I got away from the cops I'm screaming, "Fuck them hoes!"
Then I stepped outside, jumped into my ride
Seen a couple of baseheads hanging out at the park
Pulled over and parked, showed a sample rock
Had all the baseheads on my jock
A crack fiend got ill and tried to snatch my 'caine
Whipped out my Mag, blew out his brains
You see, crime is life, and life is crime
But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme
Not real life

[VERSE 3]
All the baseheads on the corner ran
Then a lady shouted out, "That guy killed a man! He killed somebody!"
Oh shit, God damn, I got a witness
Two to her head and said, "Bitch, mind your business!"
Jumped into my car, left the scene of the crime
Two murders uncalled for, doing no time
I'm a gangsta on the run, my solution's a gun
And I'll beat up your mama, just for fun
One day I was chilling on the East side of town
Not a basehead in sight and none to be found
So my Fila's kept stepping to the sidewalk beat
And my jammy's kind of warm cause I'm packing heat
You might think I'm a statistic or worthless repeat
But if I don't sell drugs then I won't eat
Some think that I'm dumb
I don't care what they think
But I'm gonna keep getting paid until I'm locked in the clink
Or Uzis be popping at my body like thunder
And I'm dead like a doorknob six feet under
That's the consequences
Got rich man inferences
I'll blow up your mama with military defenses
Unemployed with a Benz, make a schoolboy hate it
Bullet holes on the side so you know it's drug related
Ten G's in my pocket just for style and profile
And born in New York in Copiague, Long Isle
And raised in the Motown
Where brothers throw down
Beefing with the chief and best believe me you will go down
Don't start none boy, won't be none
Brother want some
Then you got to get some
Crime is life, and life is crime
But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme
Not real life

[VERSE 4]
Kicked in the face with the dopeman reality
The brother's hard with a criminal personality
No one scares me, no one dares me
Shoot a brother in the back for crack
Cause no one cares, see
I'm not 18, so I can be wild
Cause in the court's eyes I'm still a juvenile
Reel Life Product, it's a rock, it's a rock
Got your neighborhood smoking for blocks and blocks
If you're a fool be smoking, puffin' dicks be choking
Two weeks later your arms be broken
Wake up to reality
I don't have a negative personality
But everyone has to do what they have to to get by
Even if you sell crack, guy
