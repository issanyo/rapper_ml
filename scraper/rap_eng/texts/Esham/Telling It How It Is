[VERSE 1]
What's up ya'll my name is Esham Smith
The chosen one with the giving gift
Of speech to teach and just flow like fluid
I pray to God to make sho' I can do it
Niggas spitting venom, jealous talking shit
But those who oppose can suck my dick
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it to clock duckets
Jump on the stage, grab my dick and say "Fuck it!"
My brother named James is a hardcore nigga
Got the Mini-14 with a squeaky trigger
We're coming out hardcore
Give you what you came for
We're just some niggas that opened up Hell's Doors
Esham is here and I came to tell you
My shit's so dope it's drug paraphernalia
I hate to be the one to tell them you ain't shit
But if there's any questions asked I'll be telling it
Fuck it I'm running a play like a marathon
I'll grab the mic and begin to carry on
I'm the E to the S to the H to the A to the M
And I'm him
So don't ever try to down me
My shadow it darkens your doorstep so be warned
The Devil's been inside me ever since I was born
This is your first and last warning
You better pray to God you'll be alive in the morning

[VERSE 2]
I'm cooler than the ice on the ground in the winter
When I grab that mic I am finna'
Kick a rhyme in your face
Back to back with the bass
Then all the hoes will know Esham's in the place
I'm slicker and quicker
See I don't drink liquor
Wine is fine but it's about that time
For me to jump up and say my name again
See I don't stop rapping 'til the party ends
All ya'll silly hoes chasing Trues and Vogues
But you always see E in new jewels and clothes
Never thought I would get it
Now I got it now you want it
I'm going to use and abuse it
So I might as well flaunt it
I'm going to shake my thing
Bust a rap, don't sing
See my name ain't Elvis but I'm the king
Not the same old gimmick
Not the same old game
If you don't nod your head then I'm to blame
But I guess I got to go until the next intro
But remember Esham's dope, ho
