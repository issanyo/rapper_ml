[VERSE 1]
Losing my inhibitions
Call it my intuitions
Something's going on if I'm feeling not superstitious
I'm vicious
I'm trapped inside the paradox
Where my thoughts get twisted like some dredlocks
I never, or ever wondered about the voodoo
I sing the voodoo
And now my deepest fears is coming true
I never loved you but I hate you, oww
How could I love you how
Because I hate you now
So wonder
I'll take you under with the Wicketness
And with the Wicketness
I'll make a preacher slit his fucking wrist
No coming near me when I'm thinking this
Cause when I'm thinking this
I'm thinking Suicidalist, uhh
So back up off me, bust a brain cell
I bust a brain cell
I fall asleep and dream about Hell
Some wonder why I'm even calling ya'll
The sky is falling ya'll
But after all is my deepest fear

[HOOK]
Morty (nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide)
Morty (how you going to hide from the fears inside)

[VERSE 2]
Chemical dependency
Suicidal tendencies
Brain on melt down
Street lobotomy
Claustrophobia
Locked in a pine box
Now I lay me down to sleep
Six feet deep
Closed Casket
Just another basket case
Not a mannequin
But a mad man, so you're panicking
Run from it
Everybody scared, so you're calling out
Buckshot, shotgun blast
Now you're falling out
Everybody hide from the deepest fears inside
Watch me and my man Morty take you on a Murdaride
Suicide, Symptoms of Insanity
I'm blacking out
Polly want a cracker but I'm never ever cracking out
Call me Dr. Frankenstein
Dead bodies stinking, I'm
Gonna get with you
When I hit ya I'mma slit ya
Nobody can hold me
I'm going to say this clear
Buried alive in a pine box is my deepest fear

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
It's ever so clear
My deepest fear is to hear the screams
The sounds of a madman
Embodied in Morty's Theme
I dream
And nightmares come true, simply voodoo
Hallucinating visions of killing you
The thought of even thinking that I think I need a shrink
In fact I think I need some therapy
Cause ain't nobody helping me
Since I got no excuses for mental abuses
I'm losing faith
My only fear is to love instead of hate you
Born and bred
Born dead
My mind bled
Every time the Holy Bible was read
Instead I lost consciousness
And wound up with wicket ways
Think about voodoo dolls
Running wild, my last days
Spent with Morty, my shorty
No ventriloquist
Esham the Unholy
Straight Suicidalist

[HOOK]
