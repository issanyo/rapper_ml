(Esham Talking)

Verse 1: Esham

Im a Detroit Playa like Biggie Smalls saids
So I never on tricks thats bald head
And the car you riding in, I know you loves Black
Im from Detroit baby, I been test drove back
And plus you dirty rat, you need a chineese slap
You say you wanta battle me, but you can't rap
In the new millenium, I hope you all would die
Cause some of those styles yaw chouse is wild

Verse 2: T.N.T

From the East out-of-towner, where you find T.N.T.,
With the smoke in my hand,in the fithy reme
Back 7 M.I.L.E., West to East (Westside)
Hit crashes
Swerving
100 spokes
Hataz wanta me to krash it
Pus I pack the plastic
The situation drastic
Still Political
Still Poetic Ho
Yeah

(Chorous x4)

Verse 3: Esham

You say you wanta get your gamble on
Get your bang on
Slang on
Get your trick
And get Gone in the Wind like Ghandie
Out hunting for a fine little mommy
Might see "E" on 7 M.I.L.E.,
Manhattan N-Y-C, East Coast
To Cali
I be running through this bitch like Barry Sanders
Detroit underground commander
Say you bust something
Disscus someting
Smoke a little crush something
Plus ride a little plus on em

(Chrous x4)
