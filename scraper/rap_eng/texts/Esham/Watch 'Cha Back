[VERSE 1]
Well where I stay it's like basehead Heaven
Brothers clock dollars 24-7
Some get caught and some don't
Some'll make big money, some won't
Some bite the bullet the hard way
Brothers play the game of death
But don't know how to play
Money in your pocket, can't roll 'cause you're square
Living day to day is a black man's dare
Money, things, and jealousy's a big part of life
You thought you were the man
'Til they stabbed you with a knife
They took your whole sack
Got stabbed for a piece of crack
Brothers don't know how to act
Watch 'cha back

[HOOK]
They're going get you
You better watch 'cha back (x4)

[VERSE 2]
Grow up in the ghetto acting savage
When junkies smoked dope
And murder was average
How could you cope in the city of dope
Young brother hanging from a tree by a rope
Your selling pound to pound
Earning nothing but a name
In the streets you got fame
But it'll kill you all the same
Flashing cash and thinking you're on top
But you fell to the bottom when the gun went pop
A brother who's nothing will always have nothing
That's a fact
People don't know how to act
Watch 'cha back

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Walking down the street around 12 at night
Trying to sell rocks but ain't a basehead in sight
One pops up from out of nowhere
And then another and another and another
Should have watched 'cha back like a soldier
I told you
They're gonna get you brother

[HOOK]
