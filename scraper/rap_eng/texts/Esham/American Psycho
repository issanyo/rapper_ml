[Intro:]
Yeah woke up on the wrong side of the bed
With all these voices in my head
One of them said

[Hook]
It feels like I'm taking steps closer to my death
Today I just might have inhaled my last breath
What was I think smoking wet in cigarettes
The only explaination is
I'm trying to kill myself
It feels like I'm taking steps closer to my death
Today I just might have inhaled my last breath
What was I think smoking wet in cigarettes
The only explaination is
I'm trying to kill myself

[Verse 1]
Cahin blunt smoking my thrid eye open
Would fly back to heaven but one of my wings broken
Hoping God forgive me holla if somebody here me
Only send my blessings when the demons ain't near me
October 30th must be devil's night
So turn down my mic and make sure my level's right
The suicidal note I write, I recite they mind
They trying to stop me from living life with all they might
I spit that potent pass it, I make too many classics
Plus I'm the poison for all you fucking rat bastards
So follow me into a suicidal flow
Spit it suicidal just like this
Suicidalist

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
Please lord for heaven's sake let me just get that cake
If not then give me the ingediants and I'mma bake
I can make the earthquake I can make the Earth shake
Done him in the worst way killed him on his birthday
The more I drink the more I think I'm heading for cremation
But if I blink I just might be in a bloody situation
I lived a hard life in the fast lane, hard pains
Winning big money from the devil in the dice games
Everything on the line playing with my life man
You win you live, you lose you die
It's kinda frightning

[Hook]
