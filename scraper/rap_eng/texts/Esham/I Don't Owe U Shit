[INTRO]
Yeah, this goes out to all them niggas
Who bit my shit In '93
And still think I owe' em somethin'
Check it out ya'll

Eat a dick up, eat a dick up, eat a dick up
Eat a dick up, eat a dick up, eat a dick up
Eat a dick up motherfuckers
(I gotta let these niggas know)
(Maybe they're just jealous of the dollars I'm makin')

[VERSE 1]
I don't owe no nigga nothin' but some feel like you, so
Left yo ass alone like Robinson Crusoe
I can freak the styles like I motherfuckin' want to
And if you wanna kill yourself, why don't you?
13 ways, now it's all in the news
Life after death, which one do you choose
Of course, I feel no remorse for a sucka
And if you wanna die you just a dead motherfucka
So pucker up and kiss my ass for me
My shotgun said Blaz4me
Blasphemy is what I'm speakin'
Freakin' my technique, and wreckin' the set
With a TEC you get wet
Upset, I shipwreck the whole skit
Just like Bobbitt, cuttin' off dicks in the mix
Fuck them tricks like in them flicks
I'll burn that ass like a BIC
'Cause I don't owe you shit

[HOOK]
Psycho alpha disco beta, I don't owe you shit
Psycho alpha disco beta, I don't owe you shit
Psycho alpha disco beta, I don't owe you shit
Psycho alpha disco beta, I don't owe you shit

[VERSE 2]
I don't owe you no nothin' like I said once befo' and
Niggas like yourself best to act like you know and
Oh man, I fucked your ho and
Left some semen in her
Demon like The Omen
Yo man, don't even try that shit
With the Unholy Black Devil, niggas can't get with
I fuck up shit just like this 'cause
This is for the Suicidalists
Don't miss if I bust a cap at your cranium
Russian Roulette who let me explain to 'um
Death ain't nothin' but life without the Bible
Oh don't let me go get my fuckin' rifle
I'll go get my 12-gauge and bust one
Slug in your head, In God you trust son
I don't like the reverend when I state
Don't even pass the collection plate
'Cause I don't owe you shit

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I don't owe you, but I know you
So you think you can get inside my head like a shrink
But I'm down with the crew called N-A-T-A-S
And we burn up shit like David Koresh
Nevertheless don't stress me, test me, or press me
Or the cops will have to come and arrest me
For kickin' up dust, if I must, I bust
In the 9-4 more niggas I can't trust
So when you see me better realize and recognize
That I can't be chastised
Open your eyes sucka, and see me just for what I am
A bad ass nigga who jams, God damn, bam
Niggas betta scram
I'm shootin' up the joint like Yosemite Sam
I am, not your regular nigga, I will
Whip out the steel if you feel
'Cause I don't owe you shit
