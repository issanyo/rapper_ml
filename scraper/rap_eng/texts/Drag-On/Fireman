[Introduction]
I don't really want to hurt nobody, I just want to live my life
Feel me, come on, baby, where we at, baby, let's get it, come on

[Verse One]
How many niggers' seen a shotgun shot
Looks like something's coming at you non-stop
A James Brown make you say it loud, let's walk through this block, head up
And, anybody can pop a lead off, let me see you shoot a fifty calibre
And, pop a head of, we can read it all, I said whoever's in my target
I'm going to end it all, some niggers' better move back, move back
Somebody better duck their head
Because your buddy's mum's about to be in the 'All Black'
Because a niggers' white tee is about to turn red, and I don't give a fuck
When I'm sitting before the judge, 'Yeah, I did it, what'
Pumping in the cell by myself because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigga with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman

[Verse Two]
Who the fuck said Drag couldn't come back, he said it, now where's my gun at
Nigga won that because I done raised a lot of niggers'
And, now I want my sons' back, I catch a nigga at a party, matter of fact
I be up in his lobby letting my man hold my shotty, niggers'
I don't want to hrt nobody with some guns, I've got to do what I've got to do
Pull out, and then shoot who I've got to shoot, hang a nigga off the roof
By his shoes, and slip, I hope he's got a parachute, I'm the zone, dog
I'm by myself at my home, dog, everybody, just leave me the fuck alone, dog
Because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigga with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman

[Verse Three]
I wasn't grown right, my head wasn't screwed on tight
Andm so I pause every line because it takes time
For a boss to be mad about his crime, this is how I deal with a snitch
Cut his tongue out, and mail it to his bitch because when a nigga run his lips
That makes me want to hurt somebody, but I ain't that nigga, that, uh
Come over for chitter chatter because if you owe me a favor
Talking don't really matter, either you've got it or you don't
Or you will or you won't, trying to take your dough, you ain't no better
Hide your thoughts, now you on life support, and can't cry, might die driving
Pull the stick, I'm going to pull up in my Audi, niggers'
Because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigga with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman
