[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than the knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
The body's just a vehicle
Transporting the soul
Its whats inside the people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 2: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all begot
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

[Verse 4: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born inna nuh manger
And him never crucify as nuh savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler
Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure
So be careful of dem cellular and pager
Cause I sign see dem I see danger
So dem great but Selaisse I greater

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 5: Drag-on]
Me think me wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclot
And fill the block with bumbaraas cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And
Before another brother's in chalks And
I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott-free
So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told 'im come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air
'plah!'

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 6: Damian Marley]
So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road, miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic, and always be aware
The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion, can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
