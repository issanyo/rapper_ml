[Drag-On]
They stepped up Bronx City
You know they gonna get dirty
You rap niggas fuck around and get very early
Fuckin with that firemen and that birdy birdy
Nigga knock it off
What you know about the ?? when top cut off
Everybody wanna talk about they got guns
But them niggas don't pop it off
We been shootin, fightin, robbin
Niggas have been stabbin
We them paralized niggas
And left them handicappin
Yo want some Cash Money
It's gon be a Ruff Ryde
We see that star muffin
?? tears on baby's eyes
So when you see us comin
Nigga get the runnin
We treat the hood like the woods
We do some nigga huntin
Cause ya niggas ain't black or something
I let em fly, I dare to God
Took ya niggas ??
Hop on the jet on to Red Island
Don't forget this is the Dirty Dirty
Drag-On and not Birdy Birdy
They niggas ?? pussy ??
I burn a whole in your throwback jersey
You don't fuck when I shot it
Everybody tryna divide us
Keep them fake niggas from around us
Muthafuckin nigga!

New whips, they all new Cadillaccers
Fish, french fries
Brand new Benz with them wires getting ?tied?
No ends

With no friends

Walk, talk, and I talk like I walk
Out of line meet that white ?shark?

Tryna hustle on some big chips
Bricks, stash
Birdman nigga tryna come up on alotta cash
Biatch!

What ya niggas just say
To every word I say
Niggas left me flipted
But I came back anyway
I've been gone for 3 years
But I'm gon always be here
I don't need ya niggas
I'ma treat ya niggas
Fuck ya with ya niggas
Don't hear me
And ya niggas don't feel me
Niggas let me know
Cause motherfucker like when I blow
I don't want ya niggas near me
I can spit flows faster faster then slow the shit down
?? on ya'll but nothing like whoa
Who's the shit now
See the difference between me and ya'll
Is that my album's hot and your album's not
I done been gettin movie deals

And five double o's
And 1 2's spinning like a windmill
Through your body I send chills
Uh uh, ?? sell 10 mills

Stuck with this god damn e pills
