Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

DMX verse..
If I'm gonna rob I'm a rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'm a play till I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
'Cuz honey friend fuck many, many men
Stay wit' the rats 'cuz the rats is real
Wanna fuck? Then we fuck already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like just show the real
Then I keep spot that we can go to chill
I Love life, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come round is for the hoes
Life works, I play it down for the hoes
Hit em off wit that dark brown you kno?

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Drag-On verse

You fucking wit' me ain't keeping your health right
'Cuz me and my dogs we keep it gelled tight
The shit I pack is heavy but the shells light
When they drop the same time you drop without a fight
Burning anything that I'm putting my name on
You might take a Drag but you can't flame On
I know y'all niggas don't know me wit' a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know where we are
Niggas spitting mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me limp at the bar
Spit fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cuz y'all you don't wanna see how my simmy act
Fake hustling niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit I done laid plenty flat

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
Do you hear wat I tell you, understand wat u hear
Don't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear
Don't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear

What you niggas want? 'Cuz I got it right here
Y'all niggas front then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On 'cuz he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all taking over ain't shit the sa
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
