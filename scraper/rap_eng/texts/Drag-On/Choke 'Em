[Verse]
I see a nigga get shot, it's not footage
I got a nigga with one arm, trying to block a bullet
I used to weigh about a buck 20
So I kept a fully 'case I had to plug a bully

And who the fuck is these new niggas?
Couldn't quote a Bigge line if they knew the nigga
Couldn't quote a Pac line but they 'Thug Life'
Their bitch tell them what to do, they got a thug wife

I see my come back put the fear in niggas
I sneeze around them cause I'm alergic to weird niggas
They say I still got a glow about me
Still a lot of people that don't know about me

Nigga this' Drag
Them rappers dressing up as women, that's a different drag
Any beef? We find out where they living at
Where their mommas stay at, where their women at

They hate it out the gate, but I'm at the top
They at the bottom so I should be out of their way
My coupe make niggas want to race
My blunts make niggas want the eighth

My eigth make them want an ounce, my ounce make them want a pound
My pound make everybody get down on the fucking ground!
I need everything, these bullets in this shit is making this shit heavy man, don't make me make it lighter
My barz got tighter, y'all better give me a call when y'all need a writer

Cause y'all trash, so went and bought a real big garbage bag
So I can fill it with niggas that don't can't hardly rap
Now how hard it that?
When you know a nigga is serious as a heart attack, you don't want no parts to that!

They back spitting bars, I started that
Niggas with felonies, I only target that
Bust in your bitch mouth, she gurgled that
Now her teeth got protein, got that sparkle back

I ain't playing with you garbage niggas
Shout out to CT, them homicide ??? niggas
Shout out to BX, nigga I got you
Show 'em how a Bronx nigga hostile!
