[Chorus 2X: Charlie Ray]
Don't make me take my mask off
Unless ya
Ready to catch a fuckin' fast ball
Cause when I
Get to choppin', watch your heads gone
So if ya
Think you can fuck with me, you're dead wrong
Dead wrong

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Kids, gather around the campfire and listen up to my stories
Then one day maybe you grow up to be wicked, sick and gory
I will tell you the truth, the stuff your parents don't want you to hear
Here, lend me your ear, and do not have no fear
Real MONSTERS under your bed
They waitin' for you to just lay your head
When you go to sleep, that's when they come out
With big ass teeth and kill you dead, yikes
And they all bite, the werewolves and the vampires
And the big ass oogly-booglies
And the shits that breathe that damn fire
Every motherfucker better carry 9 milla
You can ask anybody who know me, I'm reala'
Get a nigga really kind of sick, but I'm iller
They don't wanna end up in a liquor wine cellar
We're serial ?known? killas
Motherfuckers that'll have niggas like you go hidin' shit (hidin' shit)
Hurry up and find this bitch (find this bitch)
Keep my supersize and shit (shit...)
And that would be gruesome
Put the body all up in a freezer, gotta use 'em
Right next to the bitch that abused 'em
I call 'em the Gruesome Twosome
And you should'a heard how they begged for me
To take off my mask and talk to 'em
But if I did that then I really gotta fuckin' do 'em (do 'em...)

[Chorus 2X: Charlie Ray]
Don't make me take my mask off
Unless ya
Ready to catch a fuckin' fast ball
Cause when I
Get to choppin', watch your heads gone
So if ya
Think you can fuck with me, you're dead wrong
Dead wrong

[Verse 2: Charlie Ray]
Don't make me take this mask off
And break your fuckin' glass jaw
Take a puff of grass and
Go Jurassic, eat your ass raw
Carcass in the trash
If you're parkin' to the brass
Nigga, don't start with any remarks
I'm sick and the barf is in the bag
Enough of that barkin', bitch, this isn't a game
I'm markin' my targets, inflictin' the pain
Twisted Insane, he told me to kill 'em all
Roll with the villains who sick in the brain
Niggas do nothin' but bitch and complain
So I'mma go dig me a ditch and say "Game!"
And put you motherfuckers out of your misery
'bout to make history, Hitler was lame!
Mass murder on a massive scale
Laughing as every single casket fill
It's time I go watchin' the enemies in my vicinity
Travel the path to hell
You ain't gonna make it to the panic room, I bet you when I'm
Done, they gon' put me in a padded room
For the gruesome scenes
While I remain elusive from authority's use that screen
Shit, I scream with your bitch
Murder your ass in the booth right quick
Niggas don't want me to move like this
Until they repairin' that tooth I chipped
We call a body count taking score
Add you to it and make it more
And I'm havin' a blast, if I need a mask
I cover my face with yours! So...

[Chorus 2X: Charlie Ray]
Don't make me take my mask off
Unless ya
Ready to catch a fuckin' fast ball
Cause when I
Get to choppin', watch your heads gone
So if ya
Think you can fuck with me, you're dead wrong
Dead wrong

[Verse 3: C-Mob]
Apparently, there were some
People who thought they could fuck with me
They must have been puffin' tree
And thought they were in protective custody
You really must suck to be
Them because I came up and I ruptured three
Organs that they consider to be vital
I'm homicidal with my cutlery
Have you had enough of me
And all of my mischevious ways?
I'm gifted and praised
Burn you up in a ridiculous blaze
Take your Face/Off like Nicolas Cage
We are livin' in the wickedest days
I'm out of my mind, I'm sick and I'm crazed
Sometimes I shoot bullets in every direction
Just so I can see how the shit richochets
And you could'a lucked out, but you chose the fuck route
See, cats like you are nothin' but an infection
It's time to be squeezin' the puss out
Got enough clout, you get stuffed out
And put in the soil soon
With my supervillainy, I got enough artillery
I could destroy the Moon
And I'mma deploy it soon
Killin' your colony, all of these boys are doomed
I do not fight fair, I'm a nightmare
Like Freddy's boiler room
So do not approach me with a hard head
Cause I know that your ass soft
Killin' comes easy, I know you
Don't wanna see me take my mask off

[Chorus 2X: Charlie Ray]
Don't make me take my mask off
Unless ya
Ready to catch a fuckin' fast ball
Cause when I
Get to choppin', watch your heads gone
So if ya
Think you can fuck with me, you're dead wrong
Dead wrong
