[Verse 1: Minus]
I was doing what i had to
Cooking product in the bathroom
Pen and pad with a mad crew
Middle of the map, we can send them back bashful
In fact dude, never saw it coming
Til i cut him i'm a natural
Let them ask who? if i was half the man
Demanding handfuls of cash in advanced you'd
Probably look past, the bullshit we had
To push past to pass my whole staff is bad news
Past due for the credit i swear
Put the money on me, man i mean its not fair
When i should of OD'd in 03, compared
To old me this shit has been so sweet eclairs
I beat defeat now i speak my peace
Preach god almighty like a Jesus piece
I'm knee deep in this bitch, pre-season seats
I'm sea sick, wanna see sick, read the beat
Its four 5's when i fold the deck
Six lines when i hold the check
Sevens know the rest, i guess
Ya'll bitches so upset, i set the bar so i high i don't know no depth
But i sure don't stress, i just tend to fall back
On the drugs for the buzz, what the fuck ya'll call that
Fell through the game from the range in all black
Trying to stay sane but my brain is off track
You ain't seen committed i mean i meant it
Mentally obscene demented
When i was 23 i was eating greens and spinach
In mod 3 with Black Jesus street lieutenant
You don't see what i see but you seem to get it
A cross breed between me and G's invented
A better emcee at the very least admit it
You mince meat mother fuckers can't speak you get it
Where were ya'll when i bent the block
Blockade had my shit on lock
Swerved out 20 days, Carter Lake and it ain't on pot
I plot twist on them hoes that complain off tops
I got, one shot at it I, pray up to Malachi
Man i'm high, using Anaheim as an aliby
I abide by the fucking code, it dont matter why
Bitch

[Hook: Twisted Insane]
No hope when you pushing from the bottom but you popping like a loaded four-fifty
No hope when I never get surrounded but you rocking with a crease in yo dickies
I bet you wish you were in the cup with somebody but they sure said i'm 5150
And i don't wanna hear shit not a word if you want me come get
Leave em all with no hope
Hit em all with a 5 4 3 2 1 you done leave a nigga hurt by the road
Leave em all with no hope
Tied up with the insides fried up dried out blacking out from all the dope fo' I said
Leave em all with no hope
Better run the weight lift what you facing hit em with the K then we'll be chasing
Leave em all with no hope
Life be cause i be erasing when they come and go find you in the basement
Leave em all with no hope

[Verse 2: King-ISO]
Bitch I started in the dirt to divert purpose
And people telling you you were worthless
And now I made it but I'll still-a wet em up like the Earth's surface
And wipe em out like they were surfin'
It's kinda funny how I started on the corner of the curb servin'
When dope was the preferred purchase and perps lurkin'
And now I'm selling dope verses them pervs slurpin'
And fiends flying off the sail like bird perches
I'm smoking purps cuz my nerves hurtin'
You thought them niggas was your homies but they weren't cuz they were serpents
That's on the turf you'll get murked urgent
Them thangs squirt cross a nigga name out like a word surgeon
You niggas scrubs go to work nurses
Shit I knew it all along I'm referred to in third person
These rappers run around in skirts, purses
And try bangin in their music you could die, was your verse worth it?
I'm comin to get you niggas better foot it
Kill you when whoever lookin
Seven foot up under Killa Rel a put em
Take your cerabellum put the metal to it
I'm a killa the truth is sittin' in 'plane' sight like 9/11 footage
How the hell you lookin like you mad? Cuz I made it homie
They wanna fill me up with lead cuz I got this paper on me
I'm on The Edge and with this razor give you a taper homie
Promise you right hand up, and you can take it for me
They want my life? Then come and take it from me
I run with killas and they support me basically all the Brain's an army
All them threats they makin' like they can harm me it's brazy doggy
Treat em like my nigga Snake we can beef like I came from Arby's
Twin Glocks, call em Snoop and Pac, that's a gangsta party
Keep the Tech cuz I'm Treacherous niggas know my Nature's Naughty
Lethal Weapon and veteran like I'm in the Navy y'all see
If they step my direction I guess I gotta take 'em off me

[Verse 3: Omega Sin]
When I was staring at the stars I was breaking into cars
You had to have a steady hand or you can set off the alarm
Make sure noones watching when its time to break the locks in
Watch the company you keep cause even friends can get to talkin
Im gettin high like boom biddy bye bye
What a helluva night I caught a body with the cianide
Got me spittin on the mic killin every beat
Look me in my eyes when I tell you that its my time
I got a blade thatll rip right thru ya denim ill give em an enima
And pump the body fulla venom
Make it a movie so you watch it at the cinema
I can buy your soul all I need is ya signature
Leave em disfigured soon as the mechanism triggered
When i pickle my liver i'm like a psycho off the liquor
Pick him off from the river I got the rifle out the window
Haul em off in the pick up then use the knife to cut the liver Man I
Started slanging since the tender age of 5 in the kitchen cookin pies but I ain't really cookin pies
I see the lies thru the dilation of ya eyes
Wise guys if you violate it then you die
Its a code that we live by chrome at my bedside
I think Im paranoid from the stric 9 I got it locked like a pit bite
At the stroke of midnight i tell you this is gonna be a sick sight
Show some gratitude a psycho with an attitude Ill fuck around
And kill you when i wasn't even mad at you (Aghh)
This is what I have to do snatch cash and dash fast
I wear gas mask and a black rag
Cause ain't no other option than to put you in a black bag
This is dedicated to the underground
And every drugdealer in the trap selling fat bags
