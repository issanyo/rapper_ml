[Intro: Charlie Ray]
Fuck Lady Luck, tell me can I get a bit of Miss Fortune

[Hook: Charlie Ray]
You would never see me tripping I am loose and free
But it got me thinking all about the shit I use to do
And I can't help, but wonder what you'll do for me
'Cause I fo sure already know what I'ma do to you
Baby finna the O in twos and threes
Sorry for them other niggas if you snooze you lose
Baby don't mind I'm stickin to decode my streak
Come and kick it when I blow my weed
Now that I put the gun away you already know I'm brainsick I need a little Miss Fortune
Baby don't mind I'm stickin to decode my streak
Come and kick it when I blow my weed
Only one I can trust, but fuck Lady Luck, tell me can I get a little bit of Miss Fortune

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Ain't nobody finna cut and no pass and go
I be in 'em with a big ol dick finna put it up in yo vaginal
Take ya round the world all i do is sit her down behave you wanna get the passion flow
I don't really think you knowin what you bout to get into or what you asking fo
Come into the room and hit a nigga with the fashion sho
Slip into a lil sum sum
Get to bumpin hoppin on this dick
Ain't nobody even comin close
Man they cling on most
Eat the pussy in the bed 20 minutes later her was in the bed yelling out Twisted
Fuck around get the pussy drippin
And she really ready wanna push a nigga deep inside man I'm ready for ride I'm inserting
Just the tip
A  little bit of this Brainsiaick
Plus there's no quit till you squirtin
That's some shit
Climb another fuckin mountain so we can sin
Swing on a nigga dingaling so we can see how far you can bend
Dick covered with the whipped cream why don't you taste it
Nothin bout a nigga basic just wasted so faded off Juice and Gin

[Hook: Charlie Ray]
You would never see me tripping I am loose and free
But it got me thinking all bout the shit I use to do
And I can't help, but wonder what you'll do for me
'Cause I fo sure already know what I'ma do to you
Baby finna the O in twos and threes
Sorry for them other niggas if you snooze you lose
Baby don't mind I'm stickin to decode my streak
Come and kick it when I blow my weed
Now that I put the gun away you already know I'm brainsick I need a little Miss Fortune
Baby don't mind I'm stickin to decode my streak
Come and kick it when I blow my weed
Only one I can trust, but fuck Lady Luck, tell me can I get a little bit of Miss Fortune

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Don't pay attention to the hoes you already know they gone come with that hatin shit
You better think twice before you take they advice you know right they got fucked up relationships
We could live up on a island
I could eat the pussy every single day in private
Wouldn't nobody pryin'
Now put yo legs up on my shoulders so i'm in it deep
Knowin I'm a freak
Take a minute to get in you I be in the voodoo with you when I'm high
Take yo body for a ride and I guarantee you feel it to the fullest
Feelin like you bout to cry eat the pussy like i was magic bullet
Everybody finna die if I really gotta mother fuckin pull it
I just wanna sit up in the pussy all day all night
And just screw it lets get right to it
Lay down put the pussy up on a platter
Play heat from 93 sdub-v and xscape
All yo life fuck around with dick thats so bamma
Break out this camera lets make this here sex tape

[Death Sentence: Twisted Insane]
Death Sentence muthafucka!
The 40 bottle and a bad bitch
Sicker than yo average
Ain't nobody(?)
Anyone who wanna murder
They can have it
I be on my dead shit
But I'm flippin shit and hit you bitches with the shit that make you get up do a backflip
Military tactics 1-8-7 murder redrum
How would you go hard when I'm the fastest
Mother Fucker
A black mask like I'm space ghost
I never met a bitch up in life say no
The sickest out of daygo
Fuck it I'm the sickest on the west
Keep a vest just in case they want the fuego
Nigga run the pesos
Nigga running fast every time we catch you slippin' when you running with yo bank roll
Ain't no way in hell I'ma let get away wait 'till I pull up we can strap or battle run that safe lil nigga
