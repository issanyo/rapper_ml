(Twisted Insane)

And I was often known for the dome split
Get niggas who trip and get to gunnin wit the pistol I whip
I shoot bullets to the windows of the homes of bitch niggas
Who really wanna get up and get on some shit
I send that ass to the coffin quick
Cuz where a nigga from all I ever saw was evil and treason
Little homies runnin up wit the gun
And tell me they dont even know but it is fun
To kill a nigga for no reason
Its on when its open season
Fuck the police
Get hot up in the streets
For kickin that peace shit
Niggas'll get sick off followin muthafuckas
That end up gettin swallowed by the belly of the beast
And now everybody all pay attention when a nigga speak
Mad from a lifetime of disgust nothin else to do wit my time
But gangbang and write rhymes
Why the fuck you think I tell you my business?
I dont know whats the conclusion
I ain't never losin
I'm sick of niggas muggin when they crusin
Now all these muthafuckas wanna hop again
I'm brusin I kick the type of shit
That will blow ya whole roof in
Nigga saw the .44 now he actin like he dont bang no mo'
Funny how a nigga changed fo sho, shit
Muthafuckas is tough
Right before they get hit up
By some real niggas wit some real triggas at yo throat
And even if you niggas try to run away
They would all get smoked
Everybody real from the braids to the shoes
And I was in the house wit a 40 in my mouth
Laughin at you muthafuckas on the 10 o'clock news
Niggas'll get battered and bruised
Slippin would only make you a murder victim wit those slugs
Different situations is fillin my occupation
Whatever a niggas facin is waitin that's on bloods
I bring you muthafuckas pain
