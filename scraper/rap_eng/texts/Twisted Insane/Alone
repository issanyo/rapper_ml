[Intro: ISO]
This shit sound like uh...
You down to your last gram, right
And you just chilling on the front porch, homie
Brackin'

[Verse 1: ISO]
I be on the road doing dumb shows
Getting hella love, countin' up guap
But every time ISO gotta come home
My niggas sounding ugly and love stops
Try and diagnose him but it's unknown
The feeling that I'm getting everyone watch
Sometimes I feel I really need to be alone
And when I'm all alone I be like, "Um, not"
But that's just my resort
If I could just resort my thoughts that I overlook
As I overlook an ocean while I'm at a resort
Then I could reverse all this remorse to sum it in 3 words
(Take a vacation)
And leave all of the fraud I see
Always be honest we all wanna get away from
The evil is regardless, we are the rebels
We are the kids y'all just think all are devils
Won't be long and meddle
Jail beds with a camera over our heads
Eating meds all day and y'all think all are settled
I recall the days I would wreak all the havoc
Don't be shooting me wrong it be on the ghetto
It seem like my angels and demons agreed on it
Me mentally on my seesaw was level
(Damn)

[Bridge: ISO]
I'm hoping that I'm right like right away
Because I could be wrong with it, might be
I wanna be alone and I'ma die this way
Or maybe I just want somebody like me
Til then I'm a loner if I find a way
To cope with it, I'ma have to go and sight-see
Smoking marijuana getting high today
I'm low downing a Corona like it's iced tea
Looking around as I say

[Hook]
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2: ISO]
Solo when I need to smoke on the weed run
I don't wanna be alone, shit I need one
I'm so sick of being broke but when the green come
Here the funny people go again, rerun
I thought a little bit of fame'll leave the beef done
I was trying to get paid so I could eat some
As long as my son fed and gotta Capri Sun
Shit I could put the pen down and I could be done
And no soul but I seen young
Been through just about everything under the sun
Fast lane, the police come
I'm in posted so quick my post get the B1
I come from roaches and free lunch
Til my mama started getting hella guap because we need some
I want your ball out of loan like "Look at me, son"
I did it from her, what I would become
Was probably sick of being shitted on
I seen her helping everybody
Even people she ain't get along, with
But I ain't tripping cause she really strong
And got me thinking how the hell could she have did it wrong
Her mindset that you ain't shit alone
So that's what I'm gon do, my mama got me in a different zone
You wonder what's going on like Marvin
I'm finna get it on, but that's a different song

[Bridge: ISO]
I'm hoping that I'm right like right away
Because I could be wrong with it, might be
I wanna be alone and I'ma die this way
Or maybe I just want somebody like me
Til then I'm a loner if I find away
To cope with it, I'ma have to go and sight-see
Smoking marijuana getting high today
I'm low downing a Corona like it's iced tea
Looking around as I say

[Hook]
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone
Looking around as I say
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
I grew up on the corner with the crack fiends
And no one's gonna sit and tell me that's equal
Put up on a pedestal  my black queens
And the fact is, I still dream for my black people
Looking out the window from the backseat
Mind be playing tricks when you on tour
I try to give 'em food off of my plate
I ain't got much, people say they want more
But that's reason for me to leave 'em in the street
I delete 'em, no need of more for me to eat
Gotta beat 'em I can't believe in no retreat
I've competed and beat 'em all just on the beat
Who's the god? When I'm on the road
Hop up on a tour bus, do a hundred shows
Hit the Mariat, just runnin' through these hoes
But when I'm at the pad, um, nobody would know
I be up in a room by myself just married to my music
Look at how fast time flies, my mind I'm starting to lose it
Living a life alone, I could've been on I thought I knew it
And I don't wanna be sixty thinking "Man, I really blew it..."
Screw it
And I be on a weed boat, he goes
Get the best of us and thinking I might do it
Triv, you gotta live all night and day you wanna hit
Running through the verse but hell, I might do it
Lit, You need some brainsick it's coming right away
I've come to play the venue with a big crowd
And walking through the fans shaking hands and
Trying to find the girls with the big mouth
Every day's a party when you living life
Taking twenty shots a night then it's on
Walk up in my house, throw my coat on the floor
Kiss my kids, close my door, turn around, I'm alone

[Hook]
I don't wanna be alone
Turn around I'm alone
I don't wanna be alone
Turn around I'm alone
I don't wanna be alone
Turn around I'm alone
I don't wanna be alone
