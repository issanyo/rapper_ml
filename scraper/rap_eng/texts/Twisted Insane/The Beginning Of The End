[Intro x4]
I am the one that affects your brain

[Verse 1]
A lot a niggas that be coming on the scene
Better pay homage to motherfuckers sick like me
Never did I resemble to Ice-T, so the nigga how mention will better get like me
Stretch a nigga like he must be made of silly putty
Pullin' back the hammer then get hit with the McGillicutty
No remorse for individuals, they're stealin' from me
Y'all will let you suck it if you will really, really, really love me
Guzzle a bottle of my sperm, every single one of your friends is waiting they turn
And some of them, want it hotter than a perm
Dripping candlewax on the pussy until it burn
Brain matter body batter blood will splatter
Everybody they can tell that I'm a sicko
They be tellin' me like every week that I'm a beast
And If I believe in myself then I can eat 'em like a hippo
Leavin' a nigga like fucked from the get when they run up on niggas that's ready to bust
Believe it Iâ€™m poppin' and droppin' and ready to bust if anybody come
Whether or not you really don't want to be up in the way they clear the dust
You better off dippin' away and hide and seek before I pull a gun
Highly intelligent, that's irrelevant now reluctant you're running from me into the Netherlands
Niggas are tellin' them that I might have to eat the evidence cause I am the wicked and this motherfucker's benevolent
Niggas said I got no business up in this business I'm finna
Take a minute just get all the venom, I really don't wanna hear another song about you bitches
While everybody is broke and you motherfuckers are spendin'
In the middle of the night nigga
I heard that's when the micheal come out and bite niggas
Wait a minute that was me that never liked niggas
Cause I'm really kinda sick of playin' nice nigga

[Hook]
All wanna be, all wanna be, all wanna be
Um, Brainsick wit' us [4x]
Everybody running like a bullet
They'll be dead before my gun and now I'm finna hit 'em [x4]

[Verse 2]
Step into the scenario, meet your burial, look into the eyes of your doom
I never got a problem with you broken to the fullest if you really wanna pull it, I got bullets that will zoom
Put you in a muzzle he put the puzzle
Hit you with muzzle he might retaliate with his friends
So I put him in the oven and press the button and heat once you screamin'
And fussing love it when I get up over dens
Love up and I splash it in your Benz
Pullin' a .38, and I hit you in the medulla
Homies they wanna do ya and niggas is packing rugers
Better run and get away before bullets is running through ya
How ya motherfuckers that be choppin' you better watch it because
I'm higher than you off of thizzle
Anyone can get in there and "Bbbbrizzle!"
With the yingst this time I hit 'em I'mma do it with sizzle
Grabbin' the mic and doing it tight then hit 'em whenever they wanna fight
I'm taking 'em on but a cannibal predator better dip in their fuckin' brain
Takin' a life and doing the price and remember it when I say goodnight
Now hit 'em when he'll bent over with a bullet to the fuckin' brain
People who was overlookin' and said that I'mma finna hit 'em until I retire from the booth
2011 I was like "Homie I'm gettin' better"
2012 I am like "Fuck it, I am the truth"
Anyone can be up on the list
Just stay up outta my booth because homie I do not miss
Introduce you to a whole different kind of a sick
At first I was playin' nice but now I'm just gettin' pissed
Every insaniac with me
Standing with the forces and then we pull out the 50
Choppin' off necessity then we pull out the kidneys
And then disappear in the nighttime quickly

[Hook]
All wanna be, all wanna be, all wanna be
Um, Brainsick wit' us [4x]
Everybody running like a bullet
They'll be dead before my gun and now I'm finna hit 'em [x4]
