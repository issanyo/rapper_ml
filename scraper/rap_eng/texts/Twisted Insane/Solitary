[Hook: C.Ray]
Solitary in my way
Stubborn motherfucker till im buried in the grave
I know they know not to play
Games in my direction they would never see my face
And they would never see me coming
Till the time I hit you where you barley breathing rushing
Off to the emergency the hood ain’t saying nothing
Even though I did some shit that should ‘a had me up inside up in solitary

[Verse 1: Marco Parks]
(I’m) Waking up outta my sleep making somebody come through and talk to me
Any minute I’ma give em the riveted
Kill every motherfucker who don’t jock the beat
Auctioning of these body parts stomping we soft need bodyguards
I don’t think you really feeling me
Little nigga from Tennessee
I finna be the illest if you wit it we can rip his heart
Man I can shit i need to figure out
Why the fuck am I felling so lonely cause I’m all alone
But for the moment home bitches looking hungry dumb bitches up on me
Only just a Diss so point if you missed the point
Then you better go back and rewind
Three times he shines divine lick the feline like Keline (Hay)
I was sent from the motherland to re-invent with another clan
Military with the upper hand
Then get up a grip nigga you a pan
Hay so everything that I do is so much
So you must get the fuck far away from me
I’m sitting and talking at myself like when I get it I’ma show off a savoury
Chains with pay trips on slave ships don’t say shit I made it
You hate it go grave dig no thanks kid we ate this like Caymus

[Hook: C.Ray]
Solitary in my way
Stubborn motherfucker till im buried in the grave
I know they know not to play
Games in my direction they would never see my face
And they would never see me coming
Till the time I hit you where you barley breathing rushing
Off to the emergency the hood ain’t saying nothing
Even though I did some shit that should ‘a had me up inside up in solitary

[Verse 2: Twisted insane]
I be on a different level by my lonely and I’m only in a premier estate
I don’t want nobody all up in they mental with this shit
So get the fuck up out my space
I made a booner from a deep end
Talk like could he make it evil when I’m coming for my fate
I feel like I was just a piece of bait
The reaper coming for me all a nigga wanna do is sit and wait
Nobody wanna big kid wit a mask
Run and motherfucker
I be on a different level what with the sick
Symbolic I’ma demon I be fiending for the bitch and murder
I be in the middle of the forest and I dip
I think it’s time for me to move it to a different time a realm
I’ve been livin with the monsters
Fucked since i came up out the pussy
The type of shit to make a motherfucker with no love go bozonkas
Momma never told me gotta to get down
They don’t ever try the nigga shit though
Eyes greened up banging on the block
But the homie’s in the turf tossing up sand since 4
Now I’m posting at a pad when I backdrop
Jacking off to a Bitch on my laptop
Got niggas outside running, dumping on the block
And they all wan just to get some crack rock
Blood I’m on a android edge and I
Just my jump put to pump to your head and I
Bring a nigga down to the ground and when im around, no sound
Now drown to the beddy bye
Man I’m a different nigga
No love for myself I get help from nobody
So it’s only me
What can one do
When I creep and I’m hiding a body

[Hook: C.Ray]
Solitary in my way
Stubborn motherfucker till im buried in the grave
I know they know not to play
Games in my direction they would never see my face
And they would never see me coming
Till the time I hit you where you barley breathing rushing
Off to the emergency the hood ain’t saying nothing
Even though I did some shit that should ‘a had me up inside up in solitary

[Verse 3: King Iso]
When a nigga never been up in the system
But the nigga always acting like a victim
Forget them
Im bout to put the bomb in you noose head
Never see me coming getting fast
Let alone a prison
Listen you ain't ever picking with the life niggas
Commissary really get you right niggas
Gotta ride a kite niggas
Someone get the money sue you right bitches
Fight niggas getting shanked and sliced niggas
You ever been drugged so you lose your brain for like a week
They go insane in solemnly
You probably wondered put a nigga kinda like the humane society
Mans I take varieties
Twenty three
I would like count for like how many days like ninety three
They tried to rape and silence me
Then I got up and out twisted insane inside of me
I hate these niggas on songs
I hate these niggas won’t imitate
Pain is something you can’t emulate
I hate that we call that stimulate
I’ma run a nigga like Emmer jay
Came a long way from that prison break
Steady yelling free my nigga snake
I remember he would whip the game
Traffic get all on that interstate
You never did it you niggas just rep it you in the way
Fuck it I’m about to catch a fade like the temporary
Cut though like spades I’ma hit the temple first
Fuck a nigga I for, will be looking at your paper work
The clock said that it’ll make me better but it made me worse
I be having woofle when I make a verse
You niggas better go and take a seat where someone stoned Like it was commissary
Told you niggas that my mom was kinda scary
Only the insanity plea my nigga
Keep the solitary
BRAIN
