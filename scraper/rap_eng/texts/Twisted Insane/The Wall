Sitting in my room, thinking about my life
Looking at that draw, thinking about that knife
Never said I ain't wrong
But who's saying I wasn't right
Toughest part is figuring out which way of the wrist to slice
Fuck, I'm nothing nice
Maybe it's just this alcohol, talking to me in the night
Telling me to kill, slaughter 'em all
Am I going crazy? Maybe
Hoping the different mention  niggas listen to me daily
The motherfucking Monster In The Dark
In the night
They don't wanna see me bring the dark to the light
I think about that shit, that's why I do not sit and write
'Cuz I don't wanna sound like I just sit here and recite
By a flame, ignite
I am way to tight
To be searching for a motherfucking couch to sleep at night
Surrounded by the hype
Feed into the lights
'Till you wake up in the morning and realize its just a night
What The Fuck!

[?Ho Ho, I hear footsteps in the attic now the closing in close?]

Ghoulies, goblins, ghosts and bazonkers
Come into my room and meet that real Cookie Monster
I think it's to host a toast for the game, y'all
Cook a nigga like roast when I  flame all
I must've been the way I bust with the game [?doll?]
{Can't make out the rest}
One of the sickest in game
You can Google me, name Twisted Insane!

Crowd Cheer:
Twisted Insane (x11)
