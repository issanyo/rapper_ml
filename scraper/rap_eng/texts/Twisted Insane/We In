Plus i'm independent homie I ain't gotta listen to nobody but myself I make em tuck they shine
One at a time I gun em all down outside like I hit the ball foul
But I be on the move fucked up drunk with a couple sluts hun
We can do this humpty-humptity-hump-hump
Then I get space ghost
Back to my niggas in the bottles you can find me with a high whenever they toast
Bottoms up my nigga don't be spillin on my J's though
I'm fighting anybody ruinin shit I gotta pay for
Back to the function, let's get brain

Witted killer in the pitch black yeah I did it (yup)
Admit it (what)
Cut em no slack when i'm in it no question the bitch'll come back when I visit (hey)
Sugar cane tool, when I put the pain to em

And they got me feeling like there's nothin that I can't do
And there's a group of niggas who be dealing with the same fool

Up in the club with nothin but love enough of them sluts depend
Spark up the bud it's time to get totaled no soda mixed in with the Hen

They don't wanna see me on they best day
Rip a nigga breast blade, I will send a bullet through your chest plate
Hurry up and send you to your death day
Built up out of good to make a win for all my niggas in the SA's

Put a muzzle in your mouth and make you bout it when you wanna bang
Turn you up until I make you pass out and put you half on I got my dick up in your hole now who you wanna thank
Somebody better tell this motherfucker he a fool
Or you know when its about to go down so I stay strapped
Pull the pistol out to make you glint, talk to bitches on the bench light skin like a prince but I stay black
Hop in the bitch to easy with two bitches look at me
Niggas don't ever say she with the bitches on your team
Its way too much for when you wanna handle with the green
In my hand now who the man like yeah i'm never on TV
I'm a savage with the venom, I dress em up and send em
To the track and they come back and then they look at what I made

I'm a hard egg to follow, a hard egg to swallow
It's go time nigga show time at the Apollo
That ratchet ass bitch coming through, hmm
I don't wanna fuck the bitch i'll do that shit tomorrow
And I really feel no sorrow for the hoe I let em know i'm with the brain game
Wishin that you was up on my team
