[Chorus: C. Ray]
If you would just take the shot, fuck, leave and disappear
Then I'd be okay with you complaining in my ear
About how you’ll do they shit and how you think it's cool
Well if you stop all that talkin I got the strength I shoot you shoot

[Verse 1: C. Ray]
Yeah as I take it to the neck
Offer me a chaser but I disrespect
But im tryna holler at this broad and get her faded with me
Then I finna knock it out the park and go see Raider Griffey
And I'm hoping that she doesn’t catch a feelin cause I walk around like I don't give a fuck and that's appealing
And apparently her rarity is guaranteed but I be drunk and focused on my drink so you can stare at me
All you want or you could help me empty these fore I have to drink you underneath the table actually (suck a dick)
Now I'm playin' I'm just tryna keep my buzz
But the fact that you just realized your mans a fuckin scrub
Is irrelevant so stash all that sentimental trash for that nigga that'll listen to it just to get the ass
But that ain't me I’m off the shelf
Right after I sacrifice this bottle to myself follow me

[Chorus: C. Ray]
If you would just take the shot, fuck, leave and disappear
Then I’d be okay with you complaining in my ear
About how you'll do they shit and how you think it’s cool
Well if you stop all that talkin I got the strength I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
Hey line em up I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
You talk to much I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
What you just said I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
How bout instead I shoot you shoot

[Verse 2: C. Ray]
Yeah I shoot you shoot
Till there's nothin left but empty bottles at the stoop
Designated driver hit the throttle on the coupe
Sike we be in a bucket you don't mind it do you boo
Boo, boo, boo, you don't mind it do you boo
We gon roll it anyway regardless if you do
Hit the liquor store pitch I go and get the drank
And if there’s any change we gon throw it in the tank
And check it, we ain't worried bout the past
Lookin towards the future so this story ain't gon last
Cause your friend got at me and I hurried with the math
What a nigga drinking vision blurry and I'm smashed
And now I think it's time me and this hoe escape
No brakes and all I remembers hitting home plate (safe)
And don't pretend that you don't wanna stay
But you can thank me later take care bitch no drake

[Chorus: C. Ray]
If you would just take the shot, fuck, leave and disappear
Then I'd be okay with you complaining in my ear
About how you'll do they shit and how you think it's cool
Well if you stop all that talkin I got the strength I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
Hey line em up I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
You talk to much I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
What you just said I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
How bout instead I shoot you shoot

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Shoot, what you thinkin I was a fool
Knowing you only wanna hang around because right now my shit is cool
And I don't wanna hear about the boring shit you do
If I did don't you think it would've been me that's asking you
And I rather be with this bottle getting full sips
Instead of sitting at this barbecue and listening to this bullshit
I don't wanna hear about no past relationships and shit
Fuck the last I just want the ass without the chips and dip
Mostly because they trade their soul just to fuck with you
Fuck a coupe, um, shoot, you belong in buckets boo
And I wouldn't give your raggedy ass a buck or a two
All I need is a one way street and a speedway beat to fuck you two
And then make a nigga mad enough to kill shit, real shit
Pass the bitch to another dude to deal with
And I will put this dick up in your face
You can thank me later take care bitch no drake

[Chorus: C. Ray]
If you would just take the shot, fuck, leave and disappear
Then I'd be okay with you complaining in my ear
About how you'll do they shit and how you think it's cool
Well if you stop all that talkin I got the strength I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
Hey line em up I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
You talk to much I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
What you just said I shoot you shoot
Woo woo
How bout instead I shoot you shoot
