[Verse 1: Acie High]
Kill myself with the same gun Martin Luther died with
On the same scene Kennedy caught them live hits
Need to ask God now about the sins I did
This damn Bibleâ€™s making my third eye twist
Is this Heaven, ain't see many wide halls
In the lobby, my three friendly guys talk
About murders, a grand many died all
Jeffrey, Ted, I think Lee Harvey Oswald
Can't get infested with these men
Not my cup of tea, that's the kinda mess that make you cringe
Went to the secretary to address her for a pen
And a blonde bitch just posed with a dress up in the wind
Told her "Let me leave a message for my friends"
She laughed and disappeared, then appeared a man saying:
"Ride on the enemies, cause my enemies are the ones
That make me bleed, never fear a man! See that nigga right there?"
-Right where?
"Right there, yeah that fat motherfucker have to follow my rules
For what goes around, straight comes around. Now he gotta go round for round with me without him mouthing his crew
So if you come to ask is retaliation bad
You think about calling, you don't want to lose sleep
When you don't mob first, you gon' get mobbed on."
-If I don't do them, them niggas will do me?

[Bridge]
Bloody murder in the night, bloody murder in the dark
Leave you sleepin' with the fishes, in the ocean with the sharks
Watch you beg me for your life, while you take your last breath
Got a nigga thinkin' to myself, is there really life after death?

[Hook]
Life after death, is there really life after death?
Watch a nigga beg me for his life and he even did it twice with a knife in his chest
I told a nigga way more than once, never leave your house in the night with no vest
This shit is bad for your health, now I'm thinkin' to myself: Is there life after death?
Life after death (x4)
I told a nigga way more than once, never leave your house in the night with no vest
This shit is bad for your health, now I'm thinkin' to myself: Is there life after death?

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
I woke up early in the morning, took a piss and brushed my teeth and hopped up in my fucking whip
A full moon last night, I do not know what happened I could blame it on the rapping 'boutta get in some deeper shit
Wanna be up on the level of me Imma tell you I come with wickedness
Ain't nobody ready for me when I kill ' em up murder so iniquitous
I did it but they bit this shit
Now I gotta be on my shit like who is this I would admit that motherfucker different
Somebody tell me why I am the phenom?
Often you be talking I be walking with my demons
I am here to tell you it's a nightmare you ain't dreamin'
They wanna see me they better be ready for he to become a nigga streamin'
Casted out like Lucifer dangerous nigga famous I got ones that'll come up in your house and shoot you in your anus
Walk up to you when you're asleep to let you know it's real
I won't take a dollar bill to say you suckin' on my stainless
Steel nigga that's real I'm on that 'I kill' 'I Could've Been' type shit
Pull out the razor blade and fuckin' the pussy with the night stick
I put it on my brainsick it really ain't nothin' to me
They say fuck this rapper shit then hit up us with an ice pick
187 it really don't matter stand in feces I will cut you up into pieces til there's really nothing left
But if you go before me I just have one request
That you come back and tell me if there's life after death

[Verse 3: Priceless]
I can answer that question but watch niggas faces get filled up with panic expressions
They run away scared and get manic depression
My words leaves em all with satanic impressions
I died and came back to haunt the same cats that don't be too falsely claim that
I died to save man from his sins explain that
They tried to change the color of my skin it remains black
My heart too, now i'm on another life call it part two
Or part three part me and that nigga that's livin with precision and rhythm who's Christian that's really spittin' hard as me
It ain't hard to see the artistry runs through my arteries arguably
Since the beginning of time I been inventin' the rhyme who wrote the bible cause it's hard to read
I'm an author see, the father see, the lawless need, thief in the night call it larceny
I could slaughter all philosophies the sodom breeze that makes it really hard for the gods to breathe
Killin' off all of the prophecies the mockeries the lies and revealing with astrology
And it's still another policy that all can see, so that they may properly acknowledge me, follow me
