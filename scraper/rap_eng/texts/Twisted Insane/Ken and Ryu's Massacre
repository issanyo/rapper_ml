[Twisted Insane]
Woke up in a good mood and I got a phone call from blood
Telling me bullshit 'bout a nigga wanna get deep in the funk
How is this? Man, they get me pissed, when I only show love
That's the type of shit that'll make a nigga wanna pull that heat from the trunk
I am different type of nigga that'd be waiting for you in your living room, bring you to your doom, motherfucker whom is you kiddin'?
They don't wanna go to war
Put the nigga brain fragments on the ceilin'
Don't take my life, tell my wife hide the children
Phony, niggas acting like a motherfucker really know me
Go to war, homie bring the .44 like it's Xbox or Sony
My sight got him with the red dot, aim right at they dome
Hit them with the chrome
I got more where that came from, that's on me
I'm a pistol poppin' poltergeist, and puppet master, puffin' purple, puff a puff, a bottles bustin', barely breathin', beat 'em, buck 'em, but I'm boolin' back and brackin', motherfucker (woo!)
Nuff of the talk time to match wits
Which one did I poison? Should I drink? Did he switch?
Every time I wanna go to war I got 'em runnin' like a motherfucker put him up against it murder man and they gon' have to find the body part up in a ditch

[King-ISO]
Run up on a heavy with the fuckin' MAC-11
Take a nigga heart right out the middle
Tell me what now, duck down for the ground
And do you really wanna come and get to flexing
Blood, I'm built for this shit
Look at everything a nigga done built, brain, I'd kill for this shit
Do we have a problem?
Do we gotta put the millimeter to your noggin?
Blow your memories out, then we leave out broad daylight joggin'
[?]
Turn a nigga six months old, call it crawfish
Melt 'em like it's time to call to heaven and we put 'em in a creek
No Dawson, quit talkin'
Bitch y'all is just targets
'Cause [?] the one who that doesn't apply to
[?]
My dick, please get off it
Your bitch leaves it softened
I'm in it, ISO is so intriguin', awesome
I don't have any sense left

[Twisted Insane]
I will put a bullet in chest

[King-ISO]
Lift a nigga like a bench press

[Twisted Insane]
Looking like you're born of incest

[King-ISO]
Like Johnny my shit's in-depth

[Twisted Insane]
[Wish you talkin' 'bout who been next?]

[King-ISO]
We 'bout to bubble like it's meth

[Twisted Insane]
Run up on him with the Semtex

[King-ISO]
Really I'm not impressed

[Twisted Insane]
What you run around and say that we'll have to hear it
When you're rapping to me in the parking lot, have no interest
Hurry up, I gotta get up in this fucking vehicle and get up in this
Little pussy waiting for me with the 100 man the bitch is tremendous
I'm a-fucking-mazing, when it's coming to the racing
I be swimming through you niggas and I'm winning like I'm Michael Phelps in Beijing
No chasing, no niggas up in here it's on the roof and bitches tastin'

[King-ISO]
Pull up on a nigga, they get at me
Hit 'em with it, let you niggas do the gay thing

[Twisted Insane]
No faking

[King-ISO]
On the real shit like I'm artificial for the base G
Oops I mean bath salts
I'm an asshole, shits I'm taking on anybody that be steady coming with the bullshit MJ Team I'm dope
Put him in a hole like an 8 ball, no MJG

[Twisted Insane & King-ISO]
What's bracking!?

[Twisted Insane]
You don't wanna be the one to run up on a nightmare
Nighttime ah, I'm finna push a nigga might fly with a MAC-10
Hop back in then be around the corner
Clack-clack with the strap and
Watch brains drip, it's the brainsick, niggas ain't shit
Matter fact when I

[King-ISO]
Run up on him and I

[Twisted Insane]
Catch him in the parking lot, like "What's up?"
Shit I'm sick, it'll be your worst day, you thought you had nuts

[King-ISO]
Niggas never really knew what he was dealing with
And like a dealer's stack get cut homie now

[Twisted Insane]
Now what's about to be the last thing you see 'fore you cut blood, you stuck

[King-ISO]
In a sticky situation like a bitch and I'll be with her penetrating
I don't really give a shit if niggas hating homie where the fuck are you insinuating
Bet you niggas always tripping
I'mma get to take the boobies suck and fuck I really don't know, pity tho
Tripping on a bitch, end a nigga that quick video, just

[Twisted Insane]
End it
Different nigga wanna get defended, suspended

[King-ISO]
Like a whip out my nigga bounce out with the brand new suspension
Got tension, pull the MAC out, blackout, leave no witness
When I get this, it's like a pat down
Restaurant give you the business
Hey Twisted

[Twisted Insane]
Quit this brackin', everybody slackin'
Ain't nobody rappin' like a devolution, homie you pollution
When I pull up on 'em bustin' with the MAC
You better get your back up when I'm at your back
And they don't wanna come and see what's in my sack
And niggas at your back door with a fat bowl
Or a Henny bottle on my lap
I put you on a raincheck
And that will be the little bit who really wanna say shit[?]
I can run until the day your muthafucka wanna step up to the paint
They don't wanna piece of a hundred beast
Undefeated when I'm on the range
Anybody wanna go against the best
Put me to the test and I'm always game, nigga this Brain
