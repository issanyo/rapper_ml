I be off of my shit that's why they piling in at my shows
Shit is sick the moshpit that nigga's all wildin' at my flows

Fuck around and get watered down and get super clown in this bitch nigga
Shit that'll never be me, these are the fools that ain't spittin' right
And if you just hearin' bout' me, That shit's cool but I been tight
Do the work, research, look at the clips on Youtube
Look at the fans that be at my shows, so don't be lookin' at a nigga like "who's you?"
Solid nigga, speak the truth, I ain't superman but I can take a punch
I ain't got alot bitch I ain't rich, I still eat ramen for lunch
I still eat on captain crunch, young nigga eat on fruity pebble's
Im still up in the alley drunk for these bitch nigga's claim that they (keep it ghetto)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And I be all up on my shit and that is what you get for hangin' with them super good ass nigga's
They don't really want it when they run up on a hundred and i only hang around with super (hood ass nigga's)
Hit em' with the venom like i was a spinnin' cobra multiplied when off of gasoline
I was never to amount to nothing so I got it caught it bluffin' do it till I never mash for green
Nigga's off the weed, I feel it lift me off my feet, I put a bullet to their teeth, I only fill 'em up with heat
But ask me if I can be beat, I feel nobody can compete, I did this shit all by myself and didn't nobody care bout' me
Yes I'm a weirdo I'm a freak and yes they wanna hear me speaking  do it every single weekend doin' it all but getin' geeked
It's feelin' like im pullin teeth,and They was tricking I was beefing and do 'em whenever they wanna run up and get an autograph from me
Room filled up full of gangsta nigga's, some of 'em don't want photo's took, camera's out, cell phone, Ipads, all get took
You be off that Captain Hook, I be off that Peter Pan, way too hot but still way too cold and I do a show for bout' twenty grand

[Hook x2]
I be all on my shit, I be all on my shit, I be all on my shit, nigga I be all on my shit

[Verse 3]
(And I don't really know, if the world is ready for somebody like me yet, hahahahahaha, oh well)
Everybody always wanna come ahead it felt like I was failing living under black rain
Never thought that I would get up out the situation I was in when I spend but I only got change
Watchin' other rapper's all up in the rap game and they wanted that change but they only got fame
Wanna hit the weed but they only got caine, sign up in the industry and only got made
Now the reaper rushin' feel the repercussion hope nobody fussin' this is what you all signed up for
Bitch I am Twisted Insane and I'm in another lane off the chicken chow mein and a Siamese ho
Why me for? why me? who you? Twisted Insane bitch, who the fuck you too, ask about a nigga like me young nigga?
