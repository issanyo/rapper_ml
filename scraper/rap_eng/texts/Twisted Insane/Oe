[Verse 1]
I like to drink so much I think it's a problem
(so much I think it's a problem)
I don't fuck with these stogies so smoke 'em if you got 'em
(smoke 'em if you got 'em)
Shot after shot even though I know I gotta go up
(though I know I gotta go up)
If you’re lookin’ for me, VIP layin’ in my own throw up
I’m off that OE
Never stoppin’, I be goin’ all the way until the end
I’m a fiend for friendly competition
(I’m a fiend for friendly competition)
We can drink but I’m gonna prolly get up with a
Long Island Iced Tea I’m itchin’
(Long Island Iced Tea I’m itchin’)
Washington Apples, a double plus weed and I’m faded
(double plus weed and I’m faded)
Gimme one more Adios Motherfucker, I made it
(I be off that OE)

[Hook]
I be so drunk
Drunk like a skunk till I pass out
I done had so many nights
Got throwed up and just blacked out
(I don’t wanna OD)
So many drugs in my system
I’m much more than wasted
There is no good ?ending? to me
When I be all fucked up and faded
(I be off that OE)
I be so drunk
Drunk like a skunk till I pass out
I done had so many nights
Got throwed up and just blacked out
(I don’t wanna OD)
So many drugs in my system
I’m much more than wasted
There is no good ?ending? to me
When I be all fucked up and faded
(I be off that OE)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, faded everytime I take a sip and gotta
Feel that I’mma be up in it totalled any minute
Drinkin’ on a little bit of liquor got a nigga
Feelin’ like I’m Popeye on spinach
(like I’m Popeye on spinach)
Never knowin’ what the fuck is gonna happen
When a nigga’s gone off that malt liquor
(when a nigga’s gone off that malt liquor)
I be thinkin’ ‘bout the cake, I need E, weed, Swishers
Everytime I go into a show they always ?fiendin’ 'bout a? drinkin’ competition
I be in the bed and wanna get a hit and chase it with another shot of vodka
Man, I’m undefeated, I be havin’ niggas goin’ up and never showin’ off in work, showin’ everybody on the ground how hammered I gotcha
Pop ya? Shit, by now motherfuckers know
That’s fo’ sho’ that I’m sicker than rabies
Might be I was born this way
Might be the fact I drink E on the daily
(I be off that OE)

[Verse 3]
I be faded
Come to think about it, I don’t even know how the fuck I made it
Post up at the bar, gotta go? Fuck that, I’mma get sedated
Ain’t nobody finna outdrink me, oh, don’t you hate it
Oh no, don’t you say shit
Ho, I put you in the Matrix
Line ‘em up shot after shot, drop top, Brainsick Nation
Ain’t no whore’s life finna get your night feelin’ this sensation
So numb, trigger finger ?tongues? when you on the floor ?to your? vegetation
Temptation’s … got me in the kitchen lookin’ for another bottle like I hit the lotto and I wanna follow, I be on a mission for the motivation
Head up in the bowl, lookin’ like I really need a little bit of weed
Off that E, yes indeed I be on the Brainsick rotation
Location? Shit, by now motherfuckers know
That’s fo’ sho’ that I’m sicker than rabies
Might be I was born this way
Might be the fact I drink E on the daily
(I be off that OE)
