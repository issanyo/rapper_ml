[Intro]
Fear is only as deep as the mind allows
Everything you want is on the other side of fear
The only thing in life to fear is fear itself

[Hook: Playz]
It's a natural habit that I'm a runner of pain
I ain't never seen you niggas in the city you claim
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Got the Nytro gang chop em to the left with the remains
We ain't ever gotta hide
You a neighborhood troll and even though we on the road
And you know where I'm bout to go
I ain't ever seen you motherfuckers pull up at the show
Nigga you be pillow-talking hoes
Bitch I'm outside

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
On a full moon
Make a drink up out your homie but its too soon
I ain't hard to find a poster nigga to groom
Standing in the corner with the homie
And felt like he never do shrooms
The 40 bottle in the loom loom
They wanna go I let em know to get lit
Put a bullet in they face and erase them
Take em and make em and grit em into bacon
What you facing is murder murderous sick
Put a body in the whip
But a bad teen, running from bad dreams
Motherfuckers acting like they won't get hit with fat creams
I'm rolling with a strapped team
You told your people that you with it but I could tell you was acting
And I ain't with no bullshit, I ride up on em solo dolo with a full clip
I laugh and post em top of nigga with the cool whip
This shit was hella easy blood I'm talking ruthless ooh shit
I ain't ever gotta hide if anybody want me come get me
Ringed up with a backpack and fat strap in my dickies
They didn't really want the big gun that big 1 450
I'm giving nigga venom i ain't giving niggas pity
I'm faded off the Henny, lifeline
Packing up and rolling through the nighttime
They tell me keep it professional and not to go let
But who the fuck said I was in my right mind
You motherfuckers watching Lifetime
I'm not just talking bitch I'm walking with the Brainsick
And I'm waking the hell off before my thang spit
It ain't no running I be at the window gunning leave your brain split
And everybody die hanging them out to dry
Hit em with the millimeters on sight
And nobody crash I'm with the devil dancing feeling like Manson
Blessing two bitches at night
Bitch I'm outside

[Verse 2: Fury Figeroa]
I ain't ever hiding from a sucka motherfucker
If you want me come get me I will face you with some thunder
My anger for a hater when I feel my lifes in danger
Never take out a cater stay in my rollerblader
Ill down a thump but fuck the chuck up the nuts
It's nothing to pump thrust my fist through the guts, uppercut
So they lungs bust nose full of white stuff to fight me
I might be the clear seller phase
So no presence of evil its preservation life
I put hollows in my 40 before you think to take your mind
Before you're slipping thinking twice I'm dipping with the knife
Its a ninja meant predicament a similar with the slice
And i don't really think about the consequences either
Im a nice motherfucker but dont put up with nothing either
Im just way too private to get caught up in the bullshit
But if i do you earned it, no verbal specific confrontation
Preemptive incentive no sentiment severance
Ever its never with reverence, etiquette leverage
I make embarrassments perish from souls I just hold it and stare at it
Can't think about it that deep, think it takes the backseat
Reaction takes the wheel when its real on the backstreet
Or public like fuck it im mashing those trees
I dive in face first like its assets and beavs
Feeding my depleted enormous defeated quench
I'm beating up on this heat with the elastic euphoric breath
Demons still be speaking in speech preaching death
In your ear when you hear it smear like creeping stench
Thats some weaving in your head against your better judgment
Assuming that you fucked up in front of your bitch in the public
And I ain't even running from the scene with a burner
I just pull up my hoodie dip a foot and get a burger

[Hook: Playz]
It's a natural habit that I'm a runner of pain
I ain't never seen you niggas in the city you claim
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Got the Nytro gang chop em to the left with the remains
We ain't ever gotta hide
You a neighborhood troll and even though we on the road
And you know where I'm bout to go
I ain't ever seen you motherfuckers pull up at the show
Nigga you be pillow-talking hoes
Bitch I'm outside

[Verse 3: Playz]
I'm quick to catch a slipping if they out a pocket
I keep a solid got you tripping but you can't knock it
The figurerer when i flip it on the road when i cop it
And it was all for the profit, we ain't ever gotta hide
They love me when i shined on the block
But where them suckas at when I climbed to the top
If you hating on me now, want the grinder to stop
Then nigga you can slide to the spot
Bitch I'm outside

[Verse 4: Creeper]
When you know that I creep an OG to defeat
My enemies are meeting and are starting a beef
And I don't even need a reason I'm a thief
And I'm bringing the heat the cold freezing
A heathen ahead of my team and it sound like cream
Dropping jaws like a demon with a legion, heavy breathing
I follow my dreams and mean things with red beams
And bitches always drinking my semen
So don't compare me to people I'm better than
Gonna keep rapping until the earth the label veteran
Gonna send a gang gonna keep offending them and ending them
Rappers nowadays not considered competitive
Or a predator hunter in the game not the regular
Pushing major wages for fame that's a peddler
Goddamn look at white boy delivering backhands of that man
And never go ghost running from Pacman to pulling out my Glock
And aiming at that man pouring from the block
Got the grouch in the trash bag but if I got the guap
He be doing the backstab
I'm the fucking typa guy no one should laugh at
Pulling apparatus on the street and pick passback
And medical insurance bitch I'm already past that
Driving the matchstick put the cash in the backpack
And burning the bridge pay the toll and get fast-tracked
I'm the typa guy that's never hiding in the night
Because I'm always packing the heat and bringing a knife to a fight
Because I'm ready to die and with my trident
Ima tie it and I fight like a cross between lion and a lycan
Im an icon walking through the darkness with the light on
The only color that i see is life from the krylon
And my songs leave you choking on the tide pod
Listen to my songs and my lyrics like I'm gone

[Verse 5: King ISO]
I ain't never had an enemy when I be with them killas if them niggas wanna play wrong
Standing on the corner with a fully automatic said my 40s pager beeping on my payphone
Yeah I'm really thugging it do not mean nothing if they tripping on me then they way gone
Niggas acting hard but never really make songs like a stolen car radio i leave they face gone
Better call state farm blowing up on niggas like a napalm
Pulling up on they lawn with case drawn
They gone turn me into a convict like Akon
Thinking that they fucking with me facepalm
Diss me on a record pull up on em like race on
With a HK drum like did it take long?
This for you to see your fate moving you like real estate
Now put em in the trunk and whip away with the bass on
They got me heated flame on rolling up pull up with the 40
Busting out the ice cream truck like I was faze on
Niggas think they tough cause they got some brand new Js on
Turn into a zombie when I leave your days gone
Like I'm shooting you biceps nigga I spray arms
Leave you in ways harm I mean harms way what are they on
Play hard but they be softer then want a Drake song
How you mumble throw em off a roof with a cape on (ah!)
Yeah i just killed Batman
Been fucking Selina cow but still need a cat scan
You never struggled to have to eat a mil out of trash cans
Like Selander I pull up on your grandma and crack grams
Say I'm wack but everything slap like bat cam
That's like an obese bitch giving a lap dance
Cute white bitches be like damn that black man
Call the feds and everybody pulling in black vans

[Hook: Playz]
It's a natural habit that I'm a runner of pain
I ain't never seen you niggas in the city you claim
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Got the Nytro gang chop em to the left with the remains
We ain't ever gotta hide
You a neighborhood troll and even though we on the road
And you know where I'm bout to go
I ain't ever seen you motherfuckers pull up at the show
Nigga you be pillow-talking hoes
Bitch I'm outside

[Verse 4: Playz]
I'm quick to catch a slipping if they out a pocket
I keep a solid got you tripping but you can't knock it
The figurerer when I flip it on the road when I cop it
And it was all for the profit, we ain't ever gotta hide
They love me when I shined on the block
But where them suckas at when I climbed to the top
If you hating on me now, want the grinder to stop
Then nigga you can slide to the spot
Bitch I'm outside

[Outro: Playz]
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Bitch I'm outside
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
We ain't gotta hide
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Gross Guttz fucking with the Brain
Bitch I'm outside
