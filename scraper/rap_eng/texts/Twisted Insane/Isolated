[Intro]
Yeah, deep thoughts, that's real
I didn't choose this path I'm walking, path chose me
I'm just walking this mother fucker trying to find out where it lead me to
Try to maintain and keep my sanity
But it seems like that's hard to do nowadays
Real shit
As life continues to spiral out of control and we try so hard to maintain
Ante up, ante up, ante up
We try to
But you know, sometimes I feel like it's just too much combustion
Like my mind is just like a bag of popcorn ready to explode at any minute

[Verse 1]
Terri sent a message to me on the book and told me that I am the best-est
And she like to listen to me every time she wanna take a razor to her wrist up on a mission with a death wish
I ain't even read it, I was busy with the kids
You told me 'bout the sin and all the wicked shit you did
And asking why the fuck I don't reply
Am I getting high do I really ride for my fans like you said
Told me that your little brother listen to me daily, 'cause you showed him all my shit on YouTube
And every time you listen to my song, whether right or wrong, you can feel I'm speaking right directly to you
Maybe you was too cool to hit me back, but I know you was busy
But every Friday I be on ya live drinking whiskey
Just me and my little brother 'cause I ain't got no friends and I feel like you the only person who do really gets me
So please hit me, I'm on the edge and I'm falling
Looking at the barrel of a rifle doing a 150 in a Camaro
Waiting for bracker barrel what ever happened with you and ISO everything is still brain ain't it?
Anyways, hit me back, much love man, I'm your biggest fan
And when I finally hit her back, I got a message from her little brother saying that they found her in a trash can
DAMN!

[Bridge]
They'll never understand this shit that we've been through
(There's no more sharing your thoughts when you isolated)
Never
I Panicked
I mean a regular person living in today's society
(Wanna the run, but you just can't walk when you isolated)
The norm
You know
When you been down the path
(Wanna speak, but you just can't talk when you isolated)
Through the darkest mother fucking tunnels nigga
The darkest tunnels
(Going nuts and you just might pop when you isolated)
How could a normal person ever understand that

[Verse 2]
I got a message on the gram from Dan, told me he surprised that I got fans
I try to laugh it off like I don't know damn, what you message me for? Ain't you a grown man?
He went on telling me that I don't make hits
And when I rap fast I don't even say shit
And in his top 10 I was number 86
And then he went on saying fuck the Brainsick
Man, I'm feeling like I'm being fucking cat-fished, really
I feel like reaching through the phone and slap him, silly
He told me everything I do will fail and it would be a cold day in hell before I stack a milli
I'm sick behind these bars like I brack at chilies, but I don't wanna hear it, so I'm faded
I'll be lying if I say that shit didn't get to me mystery hits when you been isolated

[Chorus]
There's no more sharing your thoughts when you isolated
Wanna run, but you just can't walk when you isolated
Wanna speak, but you just can't talk when you isolated
Going nuts and you just might pop when you isolated

[Outro]
They wanna keep you down
They wanna keep you down they always wanted to keep you down
But you will rise
You will rise
I will not lose
(There's no more sharing your thoughts when you isolated)
You know what I'ma keep my mother fucking head up
I'ma Keep my chest out
(Wanna run, but you just can't walk when you isolated)
I'ma walk through that mother fucker fire and I'ma come out the other side clean
(Wanna speak, but you just can't talk when you isolated)
Yeah
(Going nuts and you just might pop when you isolated)
