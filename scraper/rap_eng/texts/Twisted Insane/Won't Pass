[Intro talking]

[Hook]
You can tell me that my game is trash
And I don’t mean shit
You can laugh ‘cause my ass
Don’t got no gas in my whip
But you won’t pass on this dick - (repeated infinite times)

[Verse 1]
It’s obvious I’m try’na get up out this situation
I never really gave a shit or bitch about you hatin’
You told me that you kinda with it but you wanted patience
And I ain’t really keen on sittin’ ‘round and fuckin’ waitin’
Put this shit in quotations:
“I don’t wanna sit around this motherfucker
With your mama all up in a nigga’ business”
Always comin’ in, fulla Henn’, wanna talk shit about dishes
I just wanna get up in the pussy, I don’t wanna hear about this shit!
Take you to a different level, pussy drippin’ all upon a nigga
Do you tell me that you love me but you really love it
When I eat the kitty cat, I’m in it vicious
Told me that you never really listen to the radio, up in your stereo
It’s a little bit of RnB, but you always fuckin’ with the sick shit
This shit, take you out and have a couple drinks, [?I’m on me?]
Catch you reach up in your pants and you ain’t got no panties
You was ready for me from the get-go
If you would’a told me that you wanna bump me, I’mma hit the telly
Shove it in your belly, listenin’ to Makaveli
I be in the mood to hit it in the 6-4
Info, severed, now I gotta get mo’, pistols
Even if a nigga’s all the way, she let me hit those, get ghost
Hotel room bumpin’ like I’m on the fifth floor, it go:
Bang bang bang bang, bitty-bang bang, bitty-bang, it’s on!
Lickin’, pussy like it was some chicken, stickin’
She grabbed a nigga dick and looked at me and told me
I don’t know if it’ll fit in, but I’m with it
Grabbed her head and then she took a breath before she did it
Beat the pussy while I’m chokin’, I was makin’ strokin’ all up in the kitchen
Mission, she don’t really gotta clench it
I don’t need an intervention
Take your mind, I’m on adventures
Dropped her on her knees and then she looked at me
And told a motherfucker Grinch
Shit, I kinda gotta have her call me Insane, The Thirst Quencher
Baby, I’m a little different, I’m a little more efficient
I don’t got no cash, you may laugh or some shit
But let a nigga hit you on a late night, try’na smash
I ain’t even gotta ask, you won’t pass on this dick
That’s real

[Verse 2]
It’s obvious you wanna learn about a nigga money
And tell your little ratchet friends I look bummy
I stay strapped up, wrapped up like a mummy
And every time I hit your DM, you comin’
Oh, what you thought, it was funny?
Funny how you wanna talk about me to your friends
Even though that ain’t their business
Always goin’ in, wanna spend, but I do not got riches
Go ahead and laugh, you won’t pass on this didnick
I’mma hit you in the middle of the night
I got up in it with the Henny, I don’t got a penny
But I got a tongue that’s workin’ like a
Magic Bullet and you love it
Love it when I eat the pussy in the morning, gobble it
You get to bobbin’, won’t you go and hop on top and drop it
On me like you really wanna get up on a Blood dick
Thug shit, I’m a type of nigga that’ll walk up in the house
Bend you in the kitchen, put you in submission
I'mma dominate it, baby, can you manage?
I be fuckin’ bitches silly when I get too with it
They be in my inbox, try’na win cock, off of ten shots
Took ‘em down till they speak Spanish
Damage, I be in it with the dick like Titanic
Dick stand like an X-Man and your ex-man can’t stand it
Sayin’ he don’t feel me, he gon’ kill me, goddammit!
I be breakin’ up in laughin’, it’s just some niggas can’t manage
I know you talkin’ ‘bout me to your friends like I ain’t shit
But then you hit me on a late night up and fiendin’
2 o’clock in the morning you on my phone
Talkin’ ‘bout you cannot go to sleep
And you just up watchin’ Dreamin’
Dreamin’, pussy hole was steamin’, mhm
Always on the 'Gram or Snapchat, just lookin’ for attention
Always at me for dick extension…
Oh baby, umm, did I really fail to mention?
Baby, I’m a little different, I’m a little more efficient
I don’t got no cash, you may laugh or some shit
But let a nigga hit you on a late night, try’na smash
I ain’t even gotta ask, you won’t pass on this dick
That’s real
