[Chorus: Redro Killson & King ISO]
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga, fade, nigga, fade, nigga)
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga)
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Pussy nigga, come catch a fade!

[Verse 1: Qiayz La Beastress]
My nigga, this trick is all up in my face
Talkin' 'bout she never heard my motherfuckin' name
I'm like 'you, you serious? You never heard Qiayz?'
Same hoes quartered in my pussy every days
Same hoes approachin' me when I get off the stage
I don't really care how these bitches know my name
Cause I'm killin' 'em anyways
I do not fill up no bitch, unless it is a bitch I be whippin'
When I take your bitch to the ditches
And I take her spirit right outta her feelings
You layin' and shiverin', I stomp her chin and that's
How I make bitches witness my wickedness
I do not care, I am aware
These bitches is scared, these niggas is dead
We the new brand, Brainsick, nigga
Where is my head?

[Chorus: Redro Killson & King ISO]
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga, fade, nigga, fade, nigga)
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga)
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Pussy nigga, come catch a fade!

[Verse 2: King ISO]
Pullin' out the liquor that I drink and a ganja
But I'm never wolfin', you could be what you wanna
Ridin' with the heater, I mean he's in a sauna
Smokin' like the presidential green to Obama
Sick of the niggas who wanna be comin' at me with the drama
I don't be givin' a fuck about anyone, please, you're a goner
Take the body parts are ID's ?said the donor?
But I really want the fade like black jeans in a washer
The dream that'll haunt ya, if anybody try me though
Cause I be on the type of zone that's ratchet hoes and microphones
You talkin' till your life is gone and pop a bunch of Ibuprofen
I don't know if I could go another day with rifles loaded
Jesus, homie, I just quoted, I don't know what happened
Slap a nigga, people told me I was only rappin'
Caught him by the show and had to whop him, he was yappin'
Blood all over me and don't nobody know what happened
Ghost Town Gangsta if anybody askin'
Ride around dolo in a bucket with a ratchet
Fake fuckboy like a dick that's plastic
He ain't been seen in a while, ?Geoffrey Jenkins?
Take your bitch and eat the pussy good, messy napkin
See me with a bitch and take a hit, you better ask him
Sick of niggas trippin' on a bitch, that's some wack shit
She be gettin' flipped like a ship with them fractions
Sick of niggas wolfin' on the internet
Go dumb on a nigga, no intellect
Put him in a box like a cigarette
Your bitch wanna chew me like some Winterfresh
Fuck you rappin' ass niggas, blood, I been a vet
Hold up, pussy nigga, I ain't finished yet
Brainsick, nigga, and we been the best
Come and meet the devil, nigga, in the flesh
Nigga, catch a fade, nigga...

[Chorus: Redro Killson & King ISO]
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga, fade, nigga, fade, nigga)
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga)
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Pussy nigga, come catch a fade!

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Pull up on 'em with the heater up in the apartment
I don't wanna be the one to pull it, if I gotta do it, I'mma use the hands
Take 'em all up in the back and beat 'em one on one and get ?off in they pants?
I can pull the pistol on 'em but I rather put 'em on the
Ground like a man
Get up in the van, been around the corner
Everybody lookin' for an ass whoopin'
Take a minute for a nigga ?find about? I got the
Right and left hook
And you shook when I hop up with nothin' but hands and you book
And I'm knockin' motherfuckers blocks off
These rocks hot and cookin'
Lookin' ass niggas and bitches never get up and say shit
Always on wolfin' disrespect but never with the Brainsick
Combination makin' everybody hit the ground, no AK shit
Just take 'em in the backyard when they act hard and I slay shit
Face it, ain't nobody superman, nigga, that's real shit
They run up on a nigga like me, they best have grenades
I don't wanna hear another motherfuckin' word about
How you got straps and you clack, that's bull
Bitch, nigga, come catch a fade!

[Chorus: Redro Killson & King ISO]
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga, fade, nigga, fade, nigga)
I need your fade, nigga
You better not close your eyes
When it's time to die
I need your motherfuckin' fade, nigga
(fade, nigga)
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Bitch nigga, come catch a fade!
-Pussy nigga, come catch a fade!
