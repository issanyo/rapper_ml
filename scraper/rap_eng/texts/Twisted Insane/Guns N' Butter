Intro:

I hear you
You know the problem wit' you lil nigga's
You think you know everything about the damn world
And you don't know shit
I see you got yo selves a lil bidness' going well that's good, that's good
You make that paper
But when you makin' paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
There's two types of nigga's in this world
The niggas wit guns and niggas wit butter
Now what are the guns?
The guns, that's the real estate, That's stocks and bonds [?] Hard work
You know shit that depreciates with value
Whats the butter?
Cars, clothes, jewellery all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it
That's what its all about guns and butter baby
Lil dumb motherfucker

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]

I was never with the bullshit
Fuck a internet i really wanna hit the set and pull up in the front yard catch fades wit' ya
I don't wanna hear no excuse when i get loose in the ring
Bad-a-bing run up by yourself and tell the people you don't want no help from dazing ya
Really round no gangsta's?
I ain't wolfin' only whoopin' have a nigga shoot it outta me was lookin' for no lame ass like you blood
I'd a rather people told me to just hit the gas a motherfucker had to crew jump
Waitin' for ya bussin' wit you gun if i be right there blood do somethin'
Talk how you wanna talk when its time to walk then you better then
I don't need no help, come in by myself solo when its time to sock chins
Talk about a nigga so sick then 'oh shit he walked in'
On a baretta, Conor Mcgregor dome split better stop him
Somebody anybody come and help me ain't nobody wanna pop him
Shootin' all the bullets that i got up in my gun he's not droppin'
What the fuck well stop him
No i hope he don't get poppin'
We just wanna keep him underground and we don't wanna see him in the top 10
Save it, i don't wanna hear it show me yo location
Call my phone sayin' "you a bitch" then hang up that's some gay shit
Catch me in the street no heat hands and feet blood i'm waitin'
Hit me with the same energy i'l end yo vacation
Bangin' with the blood nigga's and crip nigga's 'sup T Nut
Why these nigga's wanna act like they will not get beat up? (beat up)
Real nigga's throwin' B's up and C's up (C's up)
Leave a nigga fucked, face down and feet up

[Phone call]

Woo hoo hoo, Bluh'
That muhfucker right there too (busy?) right there, Super brackin', too brackin' nigga
That nigga (laced?)
Hey on gang boy
Easy nigga

The question everybody wants know is why they gave this nigga stardom

[Hook: Twisted Insane]

Word, nigga you ain't bout' shit
Really from the turf, nigga you ain't bout' shit
People get merked, nigga you ain't bout' shit
You will get hurt, nigga you ain't bout' shit
Bitch it's Brainsick
Talk how you wanna talk when its time to walk then you better walk then

[Verse 2: T Nutty]

Bounce out with a roundhouse and a drop kick
On some blocc shit better clean em up with a mop nigga's better stop this
I'ma get to slackin' at the top lift
Fall down and drop quick fore' i draw down with a chopstick
I ain't really with the gossip
Talk shit nigga's die really
Pop up at the moshpit and fight really
I'm high really
Thinkin' about the dead homie's and cry really
Coulda been readin' the bible, but in my hood them nigga's be ready to fly (killy?)
My crib and its fly really, you nigga's is (boosy?)
Two fingers in the koochie
Coz' you dick ride like a groupie
Absoloutely
You nigga's better relay something Mr. Loopy [?]
T - Nutty one a' tha' best of em' that's how ya introduce me
Or i'ma check somethin' like nike's on your 2 feet
On the set cuzzin'
Warren [?] block not talkin' bout no movie
Line it up like a barber shop
These nigga's in the parking lot
We don't even like to talk alot
(*GUNSHOT*) Motherfucker
Bang bang on the west coast where they hard to box
Way better like Mayweather take fade's hittin' all the target shots
Let the nigga's act gay together say whatever then the ball'l drop
(?) coz thats what kinda heart he got
Yeah he act hard but he prolly' not
See me tryna scrap hard with a few nigga's he gone prolly' watch
And rolex to the roller ball you don't wanna get dirty
I'm pushin' up like a burpy, bumpin' into nigga's like a herppy
Work heap [?]
Like a jive ass turkey motherfucker
Merk somethin' when i ride past worth nothin' sucker [?]
And a bunch'll leave your head swole like a pumpkin if its jumpin' off
Got security runnin' coz we really gunnin' and dumpin' off
Half of these nigga's fulla shit mixed with tough and soft
My whole clique got amputated had to cut em' off
I can do it by myself bitch i been a boss
It's Nutty so please don't put no sucker shit up in the sauce

[Phonecall]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]

Hit the corner bent, don't trip when i shoot shit like a free throw
Touch em' on the chin don't trip it's like i filled up with the cheat codes
With the big homie's and the big guns nigga i ain't talkin' bout D-Loc
Raised up like a freak show, young B-Bone tell em ain't nobody fuck around and better break out some tuxedo's
Semi automatic chew a nigga like a 3 piece and dorito's
I been tryna keep it cool but ive had about enough of nigga's ego's
Hands like Torpedo's
(*GUNSHOT*)
