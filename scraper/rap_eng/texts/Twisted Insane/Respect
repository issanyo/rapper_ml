[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
A couple of nights of Old English, I'll be all good
Took many days, but now I'm straight to almost all hoods
Spent many days on empty stomachs, not even a cup of noodles
Ten years old and hungry as fuck, I could eat a cup of doo-doo
Laughed at for going to school in the same clothes every day
Dusty chucks, holy shirt and fucked up braids
I grew up thinking I would never be shit
Slept in rocks and piss nigga ain't that a bitch
Bitches used to pass me by, I never looked twice, just keep it pushin'
I begged these niggas to just play my music, but they just wouldn't
I never had a cushion to fall on when anybody pushed me down
Creepin' up on it, I got another sound
And now I be making noise up in the underground
I'm all Jesus, some of these niggas they say I'm all devil
But no matter the case, they tell me I'm hard as fuck on all levels
Grew up on moldy bread, expired eggs and Top Ramen
That's some of the shit we had in common

[Hook: Charlie Ray]
I made a name for myself 'cause I've been at it my whole life
I remember when I needed some help and everybody walked on by
But thank you for neglecting me
'Cause I found my independence, that's what set me free
Make 'em pay with every sentence 'cause respect ain't free
Now get it every time I breathe

[Verse Two: Charlie Ray]
A couple of nights of yack and weed and see I'm all good
Puttin' up with despite I'm all but right, you're in the wrong hood
When I'm in this frame of mind Imma kill em
They try to delay it, fine but
Believe, Imma take my time if I see to it that you vacate your life
Cuz I'm sick of the struggle
And sick of my niggas not making a living in chains
It's really the way do we kick it
But we don't admit it, just live with the pain
And I grew up thinking I would never be shit
Never spit or embark on endeavors as clever as this
But my bigger brother Twisted is inspiring
He didn't gave up and did it by himself
And that's what motivates me when I'm tired and
Shut the fuck up, I tighten up my belt
Let's get it cracking, we don't need the idle time
And to provide for mine, I gotta rip it, spit it quicker with the fine design
And kill a critic when I'm in it and it's time to grind
I'm not a genius, not the meanest - just a small pebble
But whatever the case I peep my fate and shape a strong mental
And though my past has kicked my ass, just know I'm not stopping
That's some of the shit we got in common

[Hook]
I made a name for myself 'cause I've been at it my whole life
I remember when I needed some help and everybody walked on by
But thank you for neglecting me
'Cause I found my independence, that's what set me free
Make 'em pay with every sentence 'cause respect ain't free
Now get it every time I breathe
