[Verse 1: King ISO]
Yeah
I’m am not the one you niggas wanna have problem with
I be keeping it one hundred but you niggas kinda fit
I be getting higher than a motherfucker out of it holler then
H-E double L hockey sticks
Fuckin’ with the brain and I’ma have to put a shot in his
Niggas can’t beat me believe me it’s obvious
Scary how sadeq killed the cat don’t copy this
Been a thug since Macintosh took a floppy disk
Bangin’ out walk around cocky dick hangin’ out
Bang your spouse like I’m Rick James when I stain the couch
Could’ a been the one that catch you slippin’ with the stainless out
Could’ a been broke but I chose to put famous route
Real nigga posting in the back gettin’ faded now
Fake niggas need to move back till they faded now
Funny how I was a nigga everybody hating now
Got the same niggas on my dick because I made it out
Iso B-R-A-I-N sick serial killer on ya facebook friends list, list like Shinlers
My shit N list
I go dumb like Marlin senseless
Marvin the martian I’m high of pen pits
I be ducked of at the drugies like get this
I be of kill like a hitman hit list
Mean like kick stand big miss sip this uh
Everything I do is fire got a fetish pyromaniac
With pistols get me at it I come from the dark zone niggas just don’t get it
Confuse me with the devil they tell me I’m hellish (BRAIN)

[Hook:  Marco Parks](x2)
Everybody finna die enough
You can tell me murder ma told us with the wraith of the demon
And I mean it
You better get the preacher on redeker
You better call the preset
The devil lives inside of my veins I’m hellish
The devil lives inside of my brain (I’m hellish)

[Verse 2: Twisted insane]
I mean it I’m the fiend of all the evil
Ouija board will summon me I’m gonna be pinning ya cerebral
And I’m always gonna represent the sick
Pistol up a nigga till he bleeding
I am dead englove lethal
Get the Molotov I hit em whenever the bottle off
Nobody don’t wanna be around me when I’m on that bullshit
I be on that sick
I mean coo coo for the voodoo
Cut ya head of ya shoulders top brain with the cool whip
Hellish mixed in with the relish
Stew crap but there’s some sound some kind of relic
Bing, bing with the right hook and I know he felt it
That ain’t really what happened yeah but I let you tell it blood
I’m evil like I’m motherfucking Satan
Murder up in the kitchen just to cook you like you bacon
If you think you’re gonna win then you are sadly mistaken
I will re-arrange your brain and put your face on my plate
And you hear that I’m sicker than you thought I
Wasn’t give a fuck about nothing nigga nada
Hop out the bushes say hello and then I pull a 44
And put your guts up in my fucking enchilada
I’m on a different kinda mission
Looking for a bloody pussy I can stick my dick in
Call it devil worship if you’re worshiping yourself
Put the moaning in the middle motherfucker quit your bitching
Nigga better be perfect don't blow it
Devil nigga if he make one more mistake this shit’s gone
To shit nigga that’s real this is fucked up
And you ain’t gotta tell a motherfucker shit bitch I’m knowing
Screaming bloody murder
Come and take a walk on the darkside with me
But you never know where you gon’ be
Dead put him in a bed with that said cut apart from his feet

[Hook:  Marco Parks](x2)
Everybody finna die enough
You can tell me murder ma told us with the wraith of the demon
And I mean it
You better get the preacher on redeker
You better call the preset
The devil lives inside of my veins I’m hellish
The devil lives inside of my brain (I’m hellish)

[Verse 3: King ISO]
(nah)
I’m of that purp and that pucker
Roll up that dro let it burn like I’m Usher
Whipping the kitchen like turning some butter
Don’t be this shit twisted I’ll murder your mother
ISO case your like do hard and no other
Pull out the burner then I burn her like rubber
Serpent that word getting wordily you earned it that dirt
When I squirt leave convertible hummers
Lift up her skirt then I fuck her
I’m of that shit like I work with a plunger
Perverted as fuck when she hand out I fucked her
Won’t give me your name but I work with the number
Like fuck pull a nigga fuck from the back door
When you gotta work out be through that bitch’s backdoor
It’s where I got so good leaving home with that bad bro
You found out but guess what I’ma be back though
I don’t know why niggas thinking they be fucking with the brain
I could fuck your bitch
And I could picture out the picture frame
I stick a dick up then I hit the switch while I’m sipping drink
Then when I finna swear that I’ma ditch it to a different brain
Niggas ain’t sicker than me inner city switching lanes
Leaning out the window with the semi when I finna bang
Slipping your thumb up when you’re sleeping with your bitch again
And then I blow a nigga brain all over the pillowcase
Niggas taken let me keep never whipping niggas game
Talking bout the pulling up don’t even think they can feel a tain
They hating on me cause I’m getting money
Yet them niggas ain’t
Twin gats like kit kat cause I finna break
Tell em this is my way or toss em on the interstate
I beat the pussy bloody rare eat it like freaking steak
Fully automatic got to get em make a ricochet
Now I gotta take you motherfucker through my nigga snake

[Hook:  Marco Parks](x2)
Everybody finna die enough
You can tell me murder ma told us with the wraith of the demon
And I mean it
You better get the preacher on redeker
You better call the preset
The devil lives inside of my veins
I’m hellish the devil lives inside of my brain (I’m hellish)
