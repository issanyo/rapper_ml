[Intro]
Into the darkness...
Through the tunnels of abyss [with a psycho?]
Twisted Insane
Eat the evidence
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
He didn't hear me creep
He reached for the heat, so I shot him in his perm
Why the fuck you think a nigga go from town to town because a nigga put it down like I was [Gotti?] off of sherm
The roof's on fire, let the motherfucka burn
And they will nevah learn to unda-estimate my visions
I'm sicka than [pneumonia?] and I come from California, we run up ya, my nigga, [we do?] dig for exhibitions
Break nigga's jaws in the middle of the street, I got people that's [stealin?] evil, [than when?] take a nigga fade
[Hurtin her?], nobody heard of na', but I've been servin the purpose, we finna bust up in they crib, that's on the gang
So brainsick...
Think about a nigga when I pop one in my clip
Fuck a bitch!
I'm so aggressive, I cut a nigga, disection, [get the rest of this?] [?], take a bath in his guts and shit
I'm Gang Green
Nigga, don't be talkin 'bout we on the same team
Bullshit!
I just bought a new K, shoulda seen the look on a nigga face when a mothafucka pulled it
Rag on my face, gang bangin with the pistol out the window, finna whistle to ya momma house
In the end, everyone of you muthafuckas can feel the wraith of a nigga that'll blast, [bring the drama?] out
Shoot the block up, hit my nigga Key Loom, tell em that a nigga needa come [and boast?]
I'm doin the [smoochles?] [?] [did it?] in broad daylight, pick a flight to the [poker?] [?]
Now homie, I'm 5150, blood on my dick, strictly infurious nigga to put you in a tomb
Filla fo' realla, kill, [pilla?], Godzilla [villain?], when I'm pullin bitches all up out the womb, I'm Twisted Insane!

[Bridge]
[Eat the evidence]
I want him to carve me with blade...
[Eat the evidence]
I want no mercy...
[Eat the evidence]

[Hook X2]
I will get him up, we gon get em up
Let's just split em up
I don't give a fuck
[Happy clown?] pick him up, then they zip him up

[Verse 2]
I woke up out my sleep with the Devil at my feet
Lookin at me like I was [something?] about to [be?]
But maybe it was something 'bout the evidence I eat
Should have of never known because I'm always on the creep
Niggas always lookin at me cuz I throw grenades...
And I will take a muthafuckin fade
Take a bullet from the clip and put it in your face
[And if they clear, might?] hop over the gate
Outta Diego, California come the Twisted Insane!
Who just smokin, puffin on the doja
Got so many individual wolfin at the lip, I told you Imma get my shit, well muthafucka, thought I told ya
Risen from the Belly of the Beast, and turn the [beats into peach-red pieces of?] [?] Brainsick
[If I only could witness the phone and take a baffler?] up on a mission, [and they were listenin to this spit game sick?]
Psycho, finatical, I will scribe one in ya dome
[And may go?] mothafuckas by the minute
Might get a little faded off of doja, [but you might think that I'm Popey by the way a nigga's slurpin off of spinach?]
I'm givin a fuck, and givin it up, [a nigga by? my side
Suddenly, I will be the one to first take flight
There's so many niggas that's runnin cuz I be dumpin and have em throwin up mucus and bloody piss all night!
Aim for the brain, [?] cuz we shoot [from the?] [?] to the afro
Aim for the [main frame?] [?] [asshole?]
Cuz I be on a muthafuckin fence
For me to make a mistake, it will be no kinda sense
I am the one to be posted up [and?] [?] whenever you wanna get away [?] the evidence

[Bridge]
[Eat the evidence]
I want him to cut off my toes... and my feet
[Eat the evidence]
I want him to cut off my toes... and my feet... and work allll the way up
[Eat the evidence]

[Hook]

You have a hard on already?
