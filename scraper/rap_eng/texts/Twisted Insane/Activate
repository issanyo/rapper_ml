I woke up on the morning, with my breathe still stankin, on the corner with a bunch of nigga that's gang bangin
The homie came up to me sayin, "listen to this"
I said, "who made the beat, blood, it sound like shit"
Hit the parking lot, where the dice game's brackin, sold my heat just to let em know that I was strapped and...
Ready fo' whatevah so don't try no dumb shit
Yes, I'd like to scrap or we can get into gun shit
[Broke up on the hip?] and got back in the [cutlass?]
Caught a nigga slippin, so I said "fuck it"
That's the same nigga that kissed the [one bitch, Imma beat?] if that nigga wanna kiss the gun clip
Step to the nigga with the 2-2-3
Blinded that busta with the [bright juice drink?]
Nigga, you know who I am, you know what this is about, but I'd rather put the strap down than knock blood out [yeah!]
I spit fo' the Bloods and the Crips of the West
The niggas that roll with the bullet-proof vests
Cause it's wicked in the city that I come from nigga, and it's banged the fuck out with the Uzi trigger
[Gun shots]
