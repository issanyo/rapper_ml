[Intro]
Yeah!
Mmhmm
Can you muthafuckers even here me?
Can you niggas hear me on this muthafucka, nigga, cuz it seem like for the last ten years ain't nobody been listenin
Mm

[Verse 1]
They never told me about these [thieves?] and these bullets I'd be duckin
Just these bitches that be up in my face and the [smokers?] to get to bluffin
Nigga, tell me that ain't somethin when you eleven years old...
And all a nigga ever witness is body baggin and toe-taggin toes
It's the monsters in the dark...
That made a nigga the way I am
I'm [on Michael Jackson's thriller?], nigga no time for Sam I Am
Eat up the green eggs n' ham and scram...
Out the back do'
Might hit a [switch knot?] with that bitch and [yo trap ho?]
And I'm that nigga that's out the [deck?] and quick to hit ya
Leave ya froze, body cold, you gets the picture
[?] how to get ya when this slug gets to lettin loose
Pass the heat to the homie and Blood gets to lettin loose
Muthafucka, ain't no SouthEast gang truths
Smashin on nigga with a nine, homeboy fuck a deuce deuce
But if you a real nigga, you gon' [conquer?] what you got...
Back on the block with the Glocks that pop and muthafuckin bodies drop
Shoot for the face

[Bridge]
What these muthafuckas don't undastand nigga, is I got heat nigga...
I got muthafuckin heat rockets nigga, I'm a commodity in this muthafuckin game nigga
That's real
[?] mothafucka, don't believe this shit...
Shoot for the face

What you gotta understand niggas, is when you mothafuckers see me in the street nigga, when you see me in the mall doin what I'm doin, don't even trip on me nigga, just know I'm finna get where I wanna be muthafucka!

Why niggas wanna fuck with my kind? [with my kind]
Cuz my kind is crazy [so crazy]
Why mothafuckas still wanna waste my time? [niggas waste my muthafuckin time]
Mothafucka just pay [ya betta pay me]
Just pay me [ya betta pay me]

[Verse 2]
Cause oohh I'm too cool plus I [deuce?] the voodoo
Shootin off for ya face, Twisted Insane, who's you?
I be a muthafuckin regular nigga like [Mitch?] said
And if the ho [sayin she celebrate?], nigga the bitch dead [ha ha!]
Put a bullet in ya braids and gets ghost
Chewin up body parts with syrup like French Toast
And for the most, this shit's whack, I was born to [mate?]
Now all you mothafuckas hang from my sack
But I'm lyin...
Cuz nobody know about me
But how can...
I be ever so sick and none of these niggas know about me?
[Shiyat]
You got me...
They should've stuck it up in that mothafucka that got me right before that nigga shot me
Shoot for the face

[Bridge]
[?] goddamn gifted with this shit nigga
You know what I'm sayin?
I don't even know homie
I don't even know
Practice makes perfect
Shoot for the face
You know what I'm sayin?
And I don't even write shit nigga, I just get in this muthafucka and just spit it homie
[As is?] nigga
You niggas want mo'?
Okay, check it out Imma give you one mo', check it out...

[Verse 3]
I'm a broke ass nigga with no money, yes I speak now
Approach the ho from the do', get out the seat now
Cuz I ain't got no time for games, I'm already playin the game of life
My joystick?
These guns are nice!
[And never?] to be so hype
When I'm like a Pitbull and sick em
Stick em...
And nobody dissin, wishin that he missin
And pissin in the kitchen, and pissin in ya mouth cuz I'm a sick, sick nigga with the big dick [schnow?]
Well pow wow, my shit's ever so sickening
And these [?] streets is thickening
But I'm on some money the most cuz I'm broke
I need some ends to spend, that's no joke
And scramblin niggas like they yolks
But some of these muthafuckas is too strong on they own dope
And happen to get they life erased
Whole murder case, one tough taste, now who's the [base?]
Shoot for the face...
