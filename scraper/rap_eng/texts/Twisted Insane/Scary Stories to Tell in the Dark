[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Sit down, let me talk to you, kids
I'mma tell you all a story
It might get a little gory
But I promise you that it will not be boring

Under your bed at night there's really monsters
I'm telling you this because I've really seen them
They're scary, and hairy, and
Eat up the kids with big ol teeth
And so

You better be ready to run with the evil I said
We be killin, be eatin them kiddies and ready to feed
Hoping and peepin' and ready to fill you with treason
They only get period dreams like Freddie on Elm Street

So when you in the bed, and you hear that noise
Something's in the closet, messing with your toys
It could be a ghost, it could be a monster
And it likes to eat little girls and boys

[Hook: Twisted Insane]
You're A monster - Scary stories
When they see me coming, bet they screaming
You're A monster - Scary stories
When they see me coming... - LISTEN!

Let me tell you a story, It'll fill you with glory
I know not if you will survive
These twisted procedures and monstrous creatures
It’s gon' be one hell of a ride

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Listen kids, this is sad...
I don't know how you will react. (Where's mommy at?)
Just last night, mommy got ate up by a monster bat
Wit' big ol' wings and big ol' fangs
And they likes to eat little kiddie's brains and (I'm scared!)
Why you're scared? (There are monsters..)
I'm Twisted Insane...

I could've been the one that's under your bed at night
That's grabbing up at yo' feet and runnin' away from the light
My thoughts are wicked as fuck, my thinking is never right
I'm murderin' any and everyone comin' up into my sight

Make it a habit to grudge it
And get in the sick of their pride
Stuck up on everything envious (hallawack?) cause I will be
In the beginning I killed on the sinner night
Hit em with venom and then they get logged up
Addicted to killing em, then I'ma sing

[Hook: Twisted Insane]
You're A monster! - Scary stories
When they see me coming, bet they screaming
You're A monster! - Scary stories
When they see me coming... - LISTEN!

Let me tell you a story, It'll fill you with glory
I know not if you will survive
These twisted procedures and monstrous creatures
It’s gon' be one hell of a ride

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
You know, son, when I was a little kid, I saw a monster (What kind of monster?)
A real, real scary monster (I'm scared!)
Heh heh heh heh...
Don't be scared, son. It's just me. Come here!
Remember the story about the big bad wolf who wanted to eat the little pigs?
Remember the story about the big bad wolf who wanted to eat the little kids?

They're runnin away and they jumpin up into their house
Hoping, and wishing that when they come, he don’t conquer
Son, I'mma tell you a secret about me, don't freak out
But I'ma just let you to know that your daddy is a monster
