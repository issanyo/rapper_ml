[Chorus : Twisted Insane]

Never know when they is coming, know when it's time for you shut up
Never know when they going to pull up in front of your house and hop out bitch like "What up?"
Never know when you got niggas like me outside of your house waiting for you to get home
Never know if i'm already inside of your house and you thinking that you was alone, when

[Verse 1 : Twisted Insane]
Jim was offended by the comments that you making made him feel he was belittled, till he opened up her window found that bitch up on the couch and shoved her face up in the pillow and he went up in a roar
As he began to penetrate her he was trying to suffocate her but she started fighting back and got to scratching just to make him pull the mask up off his face , he put the blade up to her neck and said "Bitch forget what you saw"
He left her lying in the semen got away up out the window and thought it be good to steal diamonds from a demon tellin' em what abouta bitch who run her mouth and up and lying to her team and pretty sure you gone run and tell a person who dont give no fucks at all
He hit the bus stop with a bus pass with a couple rocks saw the po-lice comin' so he hopped off tryna duck that
It didn't really matter coz her baby brother saw him coming out the window and followed Jim to his house with that brand new chainsaw

[Hook: Twisted Insane]
Never know when they is coming, know when it's time for you shut up
Never know when they going to pull up in front of your house and hop out bitch like "What up?"
Never know when you got niggas like me outside of your house waiting for you to get home
Never know if i'm already inside of your house and you thinking you was alone, when
(Never know when, never know when, never know when so im always on 10) [x4]
WHEN!
