[Verse 1]
Met up at the video shoot "Chop Shop"
She was hella [?] man, I wanna eat the pussy up in the drop top
Blood on her face, can I get a taste?
Let's take a break, head to the bar to get a drink
Then I sat down, like, so "What's up?"
It's nice to meet you, Can I eat you? Just kidding, no
First of all, I wanna thank you for being in a nigga video
Normally, I don't do this, but damn, you're so pretty, though
Invitation to my place, sit on my face with your kitty, oh
But, I be on that sick shit, that wicked, oh, you with it?
I can choke you till you pass out, you ain't trippin'
Can I come in the window when you asleep, you pretend you a victim
And fuck your pussy over and over till it start spittin'?
And everything was going good until
I hit the road and baby started trippin' with no chill
I'm standing with my fans and taking photos, smoking [?kill?]
And she like 'who is this bitch in the picture', on the real?

[Hook]
I wish I never met Nikki
I wish I never met Nikki

[Bridge]
Things can get sticky situations get iffy
That really ain't shit if you can still get the stiffy
Trying to find the one but I'm really too picky
But I walk through dark hell in my gasoline dickies
She started to flip, I mean really get bitchy
I started to trip, I mean really get sickening
She could've been the one, now it's done, shit was fun
Why in the hell did I have to meet Nikki?

[Verse 2]
Really? I'll put you in the bathtub for real
Ain't no video that you call me black steel
Tie you up with the duct tape, you scream
Noone hear a thing, could've been a dream
Cut your toes off with the [?] talk, this shit's real
I fill
The tub up with the acid, put your ass in, take a bath
Hit her with the wrath, no one does me like that
Show you what it really means to be Brainsick
I ain't no motherfuckin' Ice T, but I'm likely the last demon in fact
Remember when I took you on that road trip?
You was on that roller coaster looking at me
And telling me that I was the best you
Ever had and told me you wanted to be the one
A fool, I must've been spun, and all that fun
Was just to motherfucking test you
And everything was going good until
I hit the road and baby started trippin' with no chill
I'm standing with my fans and taking photos, smoking [?]
And she like 'who is this bitch in the picture', on the real?

[Hook]
I wish I never met Nikki
I wish I never met Nikki

[Bridge]
Things can get sticky situations get iffy
That really ain't shit if you can still get the stiffy
Trying to find the one but I'm really too picky
But I walk through dark hell in my gasoline dickies
She started to flip, I mean really get bitchy
I started to trip, I mean really get sickening
She could've been the one, now it's done, shit was fun
Why in the hell did I have to meet Nikki?
