Stay high
Stay faded with all these

Twisted thoughts around me

Those twisted thoughts around me
Twisted thoughts around me
Those twisted thoughts around me
Twisted thoughts around me
Those twisted thoughts around me
Twisted thoughts around me
Those

[Verse 1: Iso]
Everybody and they mama claim they know me
All because of rumors and some made up stories
Fuck that, I'm the nigga that'll straight up call me
Nutbag, with a case of the Jason Voorhees
They said. "Take it back." That gangster rap
I'm Doc Dre and Jack The Ripper, how gangsta's that?
Niggas not fuckin' with me, they ain't I swear
I don't chase dreams my nigga, I chase nightmares
Grey Nikes Airs with the all black dickeys
Hoes on my tip snortin' all that Iggy
Whip it in the kitchen like a callback, did he?
Ya lady wanna give a nigga ballsack hickeys
Leanin' out the window with a spark, that's witty
I go geek squad with a small mac-mini
I'm Raw like Eddie but we all act gritty like
Come into America, you know I had the semi
Nigga wish he would try beefin' with the hardest
I wish a nigga would like a genie in the forest
Internet thug 'til I creep in ya apartment
Like a bearskin rug if I'm sleepin' on the carpet
Mainstream rappers and you gon' be the target
Same thing labels always thinkin' they can market
They know what time it is like Public Enemy
I'm the old-school Tech N9ne, fuck the industry
What's the enemy? Someone who don't bust as sick as me?
Mad cause I got his girl mouth to bust this Hennessy
Do I really need a doc, what the fuck is hickory?
Couldn't pay my bills, where the fuck is Hillary?
Pickin' up a syringe like was there anything?
Got enough artillery to clear the vicinity
Anybody want a problem, they can come and get at me
Fuck it, the nuthouse gon' come eventually with these

[Hook with vocals]
I got fucked up shit that's in my brain a lot
So I smoke a lot and drink a lot, Yeah
I got fucked up shit that's in my brain a lot
So I smoke a lot and drink a lot, Yeah

[Verse 2: Iso]
I'm a ghost town nigga, but they prolly want me dead still
Lookin' like the Matrix when I'm bustin, fuck a red pill
I don't wanna get into ya head but this lead will
You goin' nowhere fast sprintin' on the treadmill
Everybody wanna be a killer 'til they friend kill
In a minute, niggas get they head to the anvil
I done dig dirt deep, hardly in a standstill
Pop another hydro, what the fuck's an Advil?
At will, I'm a bad boy with the Toolie
Double eye club, hell lookin' for the Julie
Everybody tune in cause a nigga loony
Spittin' at their cards and they prolly like, "Sue me"
Ya girl wanna do me and I don't mean shoot me
Shmurda that hoe, yep, tossin' up your floosie
All black clack flat, call her Paul Mooney
Make a nigga face sack lookin' like droopy
Do we have a problem at a reply?
Jack boy, steady snatch a nigga out his Levis
Bitch get it too, yep, lookin' at her ringside
She would let him live, I don't know, let him decide
Jeez, I been goin' in on this shit
Even poltergeists are feelin' this shit
Like B.o.B, I'm still in this bitch
Like kidnappin' a ho, I'm stealin' this bitch
Ay, give me the spliff or you mentally finna be skitzed
Like the interlude, nigga, he sick
Really these freaks tell Iso, "Tickle me pink" sort of like that Kimberly chick
Please riddle me this, G code
I be stickin' to her like gorillas, we finna be, bitch
I don't give a shit about you niggas that get softer than soliloquies with ya weak energy, bitch
These

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Yeah, man, I'm on, incredible
Hulkin', made it bulk up in the federal
I wasn't chewin' on the vegetables
I eat the pussy, put it on a platter, doesn't matter if it's edible
Goin' up out of my mind, I need the big bad bee boo
Post up with a bad bitch, take a stop, coulda been two
Met the bitch's brother and, thought everything cool
But he wanted to come through and Do-Do-Do-Do
Nigga, that's really what it is everyday in my life, this shit brazy
An 80s baby who grew up sicker than rabies
The opposition got a proposition, will I fuck with it? Maybe
But most of the time, everybody turned out to fugazi
And I'm okay just actin' with the mandible
All you people turned me to a cannibal
And now you niggas cryin' like a bitch
While these motherfuckers wolfin', I dismantle though
Tell me how a nigga figured that I won't bust this here pistol
Move when I put two and I'm gonna bust this here issue
Dismiss you, you gon' have to go and get some tissues
And hide deep in the closet when the monster come get you
That's real, lost up in a mi casa turned crazy
Drunk as a skunk on the daily
Mind is brainsicker than rabies
Then what the fuck you ever gave me?
I use the alcohol even though I know it's not conducive to the shit I do daily
Top of the roof, Geronimo
Jump, land up on a ho, maybe fuck up my Mercedes
All the niggas want life
But in the future there is only death
Jumpin' off the roof without a net
It's funny how you sit around and think of what's next
When you only have
