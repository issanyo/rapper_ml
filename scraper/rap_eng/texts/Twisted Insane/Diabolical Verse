[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
And after that slow shit, they notice
I'm mean like it's Halloween with no "Hocus Pocus"
I'm clean like a guillotine that slice through your choch
Bitch please nobody wants your ass your shit got the roaches

Nobody wanna fuck around with a bitch who got mildew
Soon as he hit the door won't you show him the real you
I can't believe the shit these niggahs let you get away with
If you'd of been my bitch I would've motherfucking killed you

Then I'm off into Colorado with my niggas, they be on Park Hill
Brained out, got a bang out like '94 for real
What the fuck you mean chill, nigga? Insane has no chill just
Chew a motherfuckers face as I make them my meal

I don't even wanna be around him if he ain't no rider
Grew up and I threw up with real south east siders
Niggas that good night ya, walk up to you when you having
A picnic at the park with your bitch and provide ya

Brainsick reminiscent of a nigga hung up like Jesus
No lines sicker than ebola since I came out that fetus
I only get my kicks in jackin off my dick or stompin a
Niggas face in with a shell-toe Adidas

Night time creepers under the moon light, you got shrooms right?
My niggas don't want get fucked up, especially on doom night
Watch you mean I zoom right? passin and I'm gassin off of super
Unleaded(?) you will get beheaded nigga who's tight

Who's Twisted Insane? You should be ashamed if you don't know that name, alter lane,  15 years, chewing rappers up in the game
I can have your bottom bitch give me brain, bobble head
Like spencer's gifts, nigga keep the loose change

Never really gave a fuck though, i'm cutthroat, leaning
People coming at me everyday with for the new shit they fiending
Quit your daydreaming, Twisted Insane ready to hit your motherfuckin brain up, I am the last demon
