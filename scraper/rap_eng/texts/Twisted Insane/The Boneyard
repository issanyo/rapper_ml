[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
I'm finna take them to the boneyard quick
Bringing the body, Beat it
Rest in Peace
The masterpiece that's bloody
The slick rick
Cuttin' a bitch in pieces, on some real sick shit
Then bury the body up in the woods
Then watch the real Blair Witch
Boo Boo, When I'm comin'
Moo Moo, When I'm dumpin'
Muthafucka, I'm a werewolf
Dracula, Always coming after 'ya
Hope you get away before I catch 'ya
Putting a bullet in 'ya noodle
Scrape 'ya brains out with my spatula
I murder bitches like you and I do it on the daily
Might put you in the oven, cook the meat up with the gravy
The animalistic set, 'bout hit you with the rabies
Everywhere I go, the people look at me like I'm crazy
Meet the Beetlejuice monsta'
Bitch, I'll come and haunt 'ya
[?] While I'm blowing on my gunshot
You be wishin' you was dead
I put one in 'ya head
And just like a nigga said
I'll be muthafuckin' on 'ya
Walk up in a party
With my party and an army
Put my hand up on my trigger
'Case you niggas try to harm me
Leavin' a muthafucka scarred, killa charged
Now we walkin'
Runnin' streets like everyday
Her face is purple-r than Barney (Shit)
I be on that Hannibal Lector, Jason Vorhees
Ed Gein, You can vector [?ass?]
I can turn your fucking face into a leather
Mask and the rubber, with the Freddy Krueger sweater
Somebody better tell this muthafucka we ain't playin'
I pick him up and drag him to the basement for the slayin'
And every time he scream, He try to beg me for his life
Another person in your family is dyin', I'm just sayin'
I'm evil, come into your house when you was sleepin'
Put the mallet in 'yo dome, Everything face to play
Put you in the trunk, I hope you kissed 'yo mama bye
Muthafucka, you ain't ever coming back
I'mma take 'em to the boneyard

[Hook: Mark Bone] [x2]:
I never [?] kill an MC, Even if they go hard (Boneyard)
You better watch where 'ya stepping
It'd be a shame if I had to catch you off-guard (Boneyard)
'Yo body bloody and bruised because you got beat down
With a crowbar (Boneyard)
So, never play with a psycho, They'll find your body chopped up
Besides your own car (Boneyard)

[Verse 2: Mark Bone]:
I been murderin', all good
Take [?] of composition
Homey, I've gone nuts
You wonder why whenever you see me, that I be on blunts
[?] inside of my head, yo, I don't give a fuck
Never should've gave me a gun, cause now I'm gonna hunt
Grab it up, Hold it and laugh, I got no timers to
Ride it pass and poppin' the haters, you know it's all fun
Especially whenever you stop and you see 'em all run
No one is gon' realize a killer before it's all done
Watch who you be fuckin' with, cause I'm the wrong one
Not everybody in the hood is [?]
Gotta separate myself from the shook ones
Everybody nowadays, they a crook, son
But they ain't hangin' with the heat when we cook some
In the kitchen, they're sittin', that they look dumb
Cats going off with the bank, call it a snare drum
Never mix the liquor with [?], I'm drinkin' bare rum
I'm getting money over here, while you just stare, bum
So, if you want it, come and get it, I'm gonna bare none
Heavyweight whenever I'm walkin', like I was one ton
Ain't no sense in fakin' and lyin', I keep it one hun'
Psycho like a [?] side, now watch the blood run
Hit 'em really hard, With a [?], I leave them mossed, done
Thinkin' about startin' a serial killer trust fund
Bodies on the side of the freezer, they gon' taste [?]
Dinner and a movie, I do you like Brotha Lynch Hung
Midwest chopper, you notice I got a quick tongue
Brainsick, Twisted Insane, we leavin' lames low
Put the body up in the truck, but don't say nothin'
Especially whenever we ride, I carry a big gun
Body layin' next to the [?] and the big pun
Got myself a shovel, a hole, It's time to dig one

[Hook: Mark Bone] [x2]:
I never [?] kill an MC, Even if they go hard (Boneyard)
You better watch where 'ya stepping
It'd be a shame if I had to catch you off-guard (Boneyard)
'Yo body bloody and bruised because you got beat down
With a crowbar (Boneyard)
So, never play with a psycho, They'll find your body chopped up
Besides your own car (Boneyard)
