[Intro]
Yeah, and that's fo' real
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Cause y'all don't know what I been through in this game
In this lifetime of turmoil
Bein' hard, real hard
But I'm still here, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
Three years old in the alley with the cold
And my mom's in a trash can
In southeast San Diego with no sauce on my Prego
I was tore up and laughed at
I didn't have no birthdays, I didn't have no Christmas
I didn't have no tables with food 'n shit
I didn't have the new kicks
I knew I didn't want 'em, but we didn't have the money to do this shit
I really came from nothin', wasn't suppose to make it
Wasn't supposed to be up on these stages
Lookin' at all the painted faces
Gettin' sick of logical leavin' my shit and tossin' out the basics
Wasn't even supposed to be livin'
Saying he will end up dead or in prison
Never stopped me from goin' on missions
Take my position, stood on my legs and got money empowering all on my vision
Watchin' any niggas in my mind oughta try for the rhyme or they were try'na be friends with me
I remember when a couple years ago them same motherfuckers really thought was an enemy
And I'm the one who keep it real
I remember 7 years old, I thought my pops was a preacher, the nigga was sour
Tied me in the trash bag, tossed me in the closet
Locked me up in that motherfucker for hours
My love for the music came as a little snotty nosed kid
With my whole life ahead of me
They ain't seein' the best of me at 106 & park
At the dark with the sharks as my destiny

[Bridge]
From the diamond in the rough to a diamond who's shinin', blinding, ain't givin' it up
Swervin' the tip of my cup, sippin' they cut
Right beside motherfuckers who don't be givin' a fuck
Enough, I really wanna blackout

[Pre-Hook]
Sittin' by myself with the pistol in the middle with the devil when I put it to my dome
Nobody can step into my shoes
Tellin' 'em what I gotta do just to [?]
Doin' different shows, different city every night
They be hidin' when they right up in the zone
Somebody bring it, meetin' different people everyday
But they realize that I'm really all alone

[Hook]
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away

[Verse 2]
11 years old, still lookin' bummy and dumb with no lunch money
Started taking knifes to school, just in case one of these motherfuckers try to take somethin' from me
Introduce to weed at a young age, now it's on my lungs
And my gun's on the front page
This isn't fun what has begun
I am so young, I am the one, I want to run away
Lookin' at the world with a pure descent, and they all wanna hear my shit
All 'em niggas that be spittin' wish me dead 'cause they can hear my spit as I chewed on my spearment
And I'm the one who keep it real
Lucky if I was even to get a happy meal, livin' on crumbs for real
My mom was ill when motherfuckers was trippin' over unpaid bills
Shit
It is the life we lead, the right to breath
But I was on a mission
Don't do that stay on the right track
But it's hard to say that to one who'll never listen
(Superior flow never knew no competition)
Sure I was hot, but I had no pot to piss in
Makin' my circle around me so tight
And if they yell I'd keep 'em off in a distance
From the L.A. deep from resistance
Down with the homies
I see aida hooked up with the sickness
I'm legally carried, and that's legally scary
But until they bury me, I'mma 'come visious

[Bridge]
From the diamond in the rough to a diamond who's shinin', blinding, ain't givin' it up
Swervin' the tip of my cup, sippin' they cut
Right beside motherfuckers who don't be givin' a fuck
Enough, I really wanna blackout

[Pre-Hook]
Sittin' by myself with the pistol in the middle with the devil when I put it to my dome
Nobody can step into my shoes
Tellin' 'em what I gotta do just to [?]
Doin' different shows, different city every night
They be hidin' when they right up in the zone
Somebody bring it, meetin' different people everyday
But they realize that I'm really all alone

[Hook]
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away

[Outro]
Yeah, that real
Thing before you judge, homie
'Cause you have no idea what I've been through, nigga
Oh shit, you have no idea what I've been through, man
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's why I verbally attack niggas like I do, man
That's why I do this

Gotta get up and then hit 'em with the verbal attack
Gotta get up and then hit 'em with the verbal attack
Gotta get up and then hit 'em with the verbal attack
Gotta get up and then hit 'em with the verbal attack (x4)

[Hook]
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away
I just wanna blackout, blackout, blackout
I really just want to run away
