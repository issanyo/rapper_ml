BRAIN

[Verse 1: Charles Xavier aka Charlie Ray aka C.Ray]
Welcome all to the cerebellum celebration
Top of the chain of food a couple of zany dudes
Whoever they blazing through the vegetation
Stop complaining you cannot contain em
Maneuver the block a payment fuck an invitation
Cookin' hinges and i go and get the pin and slip the venom in yo medication
Have'em waiting
But not for long, drop the bomb shit and fuck yo Soccer mom, Quick in VIP but see believe me none of my niggas furtive you we just feed em proper long dick
Given a bit and watch her spark and catch the feelings
Simple arithmetic you aughta' respect the villain
Give me a different bitch that I can't forget in a minute but I'ma forget her anyways if that shit ain't. (BRAIN,BRAINSICK)
That's who it is
New strange with our backs to the wind
New bane kill the bat no revenge
New flame in the sack for my friends
Do blaze keep it back go again
Few days on yo back for my kin
Pain like a nigga back from the gym. (BRAIN)
You ain't doing shit but sittin' (down with)
You lucky cause the way your catching heat you could compare if it's me from the Pitcher's mound
Though quick and stop and make an example of these little half little rappers that remain
You can blame insane, he the one that got the illest hydrofunction
Now nobody fucking with it if it ain't

[Chorus: Maserati Maeson]

[Verse 2: King ISO]
Why do must some of them niggas who jump when they wanna go see
Drippin' a 9 millimeter and nigga I fill it with heat
Niggas you wouldn't believe the way that they murder a nigga
They put em inside of a box in the back of they Chevy Caprice
Nigga whats up with the beef
Women they fuckin' with me
Making a couple of kids when they be fuckin' a bitch
Givin' the women the dick and they lovin' it, really they suckin' and suckin' it, that's your ho, she is slut of the week
Brain, brain when a nigga blast guns
Brain, brain a nigga wish I had one
Give her lobotomy when they be riding this nigga
Everything I do is sicker than the last one
How the fuck is all you out of bucks?
Niggas hot as fuck when you ain't never smashed nothin'
I be fuckin hella hoes nigga never know your new bitch could be my last one
Bangin' a pistol like my name was Pistol Pete
In the ville like Nash no Tennessee
Even in November I go trick or treat
Knocking then I smoke 'em like a swisher sweet
Who as sick as we, in the industry
Ain't nobody fucking with our infantry
Murder everybody give the mission peace
Oakland nigga bitch, make 'em send a tweet
Brainsick I know you feeling this shit
Michael Vick flow I'm killing this bitch
Niggas ain't believe me, now they prolly see me tryna' fuck with me jumpin' and shit
Packing a pistol grip and I ain't goin' let it
Niggas faker than a rhinestone bet it
Ain't nobody in the game wanna see the brain nigga tell 'em ISO said it

[Chorus: Maserati Maeson]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
I kill 'em whenever they want the heat on 'em
So many people I will teach you over the rail and beat you grabbin' a bitch and skeet on 'em
Want to be off on a member they want to be optimistic
Got two bitches one for me and one for you
Ready to switch and get in a different shit it's been about time just fightin' us with the bullshit under you
Tell her i just wish it could've been
The nigga that spreaded the semen on your chin
Then properly take it and rub it up on your skin
Sicker than putting the time to turn it on again
Who wanna go mano a mano with Tony Soprano, I hit 'em with syllable rippin' a nigga a brand new ass hole
They go wolf but [?] and say all they want, I murder a nigga, this shit is hotter than Tabasco. (BRAIN)
Brain Brain
I'm coming to eat yo muthafucking brain
I hope you choke on a chicken bone, chocolate milk, chichas, and some J's
Summon a demon and want me to pick up the piece and let me off the leash and I ain't got no common sense
I run up on niggas with diesel type of trucks and tearin' bitches up and hangin' em over the wire fence Brrrain

[Chorus: Maserati Maeson]

[Verse 4: KamiKazi]
I'm the little voice inside yo brain
Been one of the best well that's venom i cannot contain
Sick ascended peter so we're not refrain
Sever the poison i consider him off the chain
Gobble'em up i puff a blunt until i'm numb i played this haters no retention given'em none
You can see him by my lonely homies swarm me bring an army you will never see the sun (BRAIN)
Brainsick, now I'm not the same shit you would listen to is basic yada yada rappin' bull for bush and see that payment shit we grip is innovation
In the darkness reach in for the lighter i go to my tombed room but i will survive my pursuance moves how about you and i can include the voodoo i can do this in the mind
I'm choppin' the rhythm i kill'em i hit'em up with that venom sick of the sticks of a villa but hit'em up with that weapon
Vengeful devil low for the mental levels all my enemies better be off my momentum and obey is wise suffer the consequences thinking that maybe i will suffer the opposites when I'm in for comin'
Opponents on the mic control mode the mufas sick-opotamus
(BRAIN)

Y'all don't wanna listen to me fine talk
I'm a lethal weapon intertwined with the instrumental till the done line
[?] I am surrounded, so pick up the sword before the war [?] rip em up before the [?]

[Chorus: Maserati Maeson]

[Verse 5: Dikluz(Of Firing Squad)]
Shouts out to the brainiacs gettin sick in the buildin
Makin a kill off the independent muzik that we makin, why? cause our brains are spinnin'

Only one cat got the sickest is the brain! (BRAIN!)

[Chorus: Maserati Maeson]

[Verse 6: Z(Of Firing Squad)]
Murder with a mic of a syllable lyrical rhythm I take em all
Wait a minute the mic is on
I could tounge wrestle with a python
Some of them cyclones in my mind gone
You're like my song
Gon' make you bite on suicide bombs until your life gone
Take a parson to a pipe bomb
And say goodbye mom the step of life gone
Murder with the pen burning through the skin
Chopping motherfuckers up into vegetables
Thought you would begin with the brains that hit the skin
With a razor shit we chop impeccable
If your compassionnel but don't say shit
Just let the blood drip to the pavement
Just needed a fucked up mind to go play with
And tell the world that i'm fucking brainsick
Doing it with the wrong but the ruth's i can't slaughter
Dumping it with the pump for the babies to the father
Brainsick in momentum with a psycho with a pencil
But i'm salivating therefore I don't think I can be bothered
Chopping it with my dynamite finna get my son
Soon if i get a print out wonder what that would have to do with god
Publicated chopper with a drive for seeing a doctor
We don't fuck around so I could fucking make it fun

[Verse 7: Bishop]
