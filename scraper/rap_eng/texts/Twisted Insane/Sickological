[Verse 1]

And I'm a nigga that's sick-o
Jackin' on my dick with the blood from the chick that I split
I am that nympho
I gotta make sure that she dead when I fuck a nigga bitch
'cos a nigga really love that
Scissor the bitches pussy and put it on the blades of the Killah
Tellin' ya where the slugs at
Fallin' up out the pussy with the rest of the razor blades for the Killah
Brainsick
I am the demon if you wanna keep pretendin' I will keep runnin' up into your home ('fore the time go?)
And I walked up in that muthafucka hanging on your WIFE and you DAUGHTER and your SON with a blindfold
Movin' through the hall whackin' and then starin' from bedroom to bedroom keep peepin' 'em
(?) (?) (?) trippin' and just feindin' to eat
But I know that I smell the blood of an Englishman

[lots of screaming, potentially from one of Twisted Insane's victims]

And have a mothafucka coming
Suitable to get the rest of the body ready for the stomach
Saw this shit on TV
An' turned around and told the homie that I already have done it
Already off the gin
Finna be off of sin
Creepin' around the den
Gettin' faded on tha mothafuckin' block
Puffin' up on a blunt
Niggas don't wanna stunt
Pull up and get dumped
You will and everyone you know is gettin' shot
'cos imma be some nutcase
Murder murder whatchu talkin' 'bout
I'm ready to see whatchu was about
And homie we can touch (bases?)
And look into the eyes of the devil and you gon' weep without a doubt
'cos nigga I'm a PSYCHO
Lookin' up under the bed for bloody bodies in my visions
And I give a fuck what niggas say about me cos a mothafucka's always ready to bust slugs with precision

[Chorus] x2
'need go head and let me shoot that mothafucka
I just keep dumpin on 'em, BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
SERVED you mothafuckas!
Droppin' like flies, 40 droppin', cigarette droppin', niggas tryna run

[Verse 2]

Some niggas want me to gas, and rap fast all the time
Some niggas want me to slow up, so they can hear every line
But I'm a-619
South East San Diego
You come up in that fine line you get your brains mixed with prego
I ain't no bitch ass nigga
I ain't no gay ass phony
I ain't you
I ain't scared of no nigga to come for me homie
These niggas rap that shit (kill niggas)
But they ain't clack they shit
I'm official they prolly in they house with some big fat bitch
I love when niggas hate
And got my name in they taste
But when I'm all in they face
This is all that they say
'I love your shit I love your spit
You's the reason I rap
I love this song I love that song'
And all of that crap
I don't give a fuck 'bout my life
So what makes you think
I give a solitary FUCK
About your wife and kids?
I wipe the blood with the bin
And take a shit on your face
I ain't no mothafuckin' joke
You get your life erased
Nigga

[Chorus]x2
