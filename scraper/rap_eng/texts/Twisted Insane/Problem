I am a Problem
Hurry get up on your knees
Pray to Jesus
Days I was in a cage
Now I'm on my way to my thesis
Cut a nigga with a butterfly
Then chew him like he Reese's
Pieces
Throw him in the oven
Cooking bodies like quiches
They don't wanna go against me
I'ma kill 'em all off one day
Doing One Hundred and Fifty
Reversin' all in one way
Nobody up on the level even with the demon
I really put fitty in your ass
Ready to hit the gas and blast on a Sunday
