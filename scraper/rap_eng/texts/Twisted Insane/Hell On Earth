[Verse 1: Firing Squad (Z)]
See my face drippin', the sweat sizzling, to this concrete touch, with these flames risen
It feels like cocaine in 'em, cause my brain spinning
But I'm cool karma, couple strings in em
9 and a half is the WiFi password
They talk the truth, but never lacin' em
Now as for my death for disgracin' em
But 'nough wreck of the real rap when I'm chasing 'em
My kids gotta eat, then there's food to come
But don't sun if he ain't left with no room to judge
Grew up in the mud, I still stomp to these slugs
And everything that i do is for this family i love
Try to to talk different
I'm a guy full of pivot
I put some holes in ya fitted
Leave them poverty stricken
I put out exhibit, It's the guy that done did this
And [?] in the streets I was livin'
Fuck chasin' women, Tryin' to grind to the end
I've been perfectin' out this hell with this fire that I'm spittin'
Managin' satan, The ground's the limit
Fire resistant, been in hell for a minute
But me, Y'all can't tell me nothin'
If whether or not, this 4-5 will listen
But hell is fine if that's where all my will of Jesus sits in


[Hook: C.Ray] [x4]:
Predetermined to fail since birth
With no way to derail this urge
So i sit back and inhale this herb
Cause I'm living in this hell on Earth


[Verse 2: Firing Squad (Dikulz)]
Man... you can tell I'm cursed, it's a warning, a scorning
But tell 'em first, I've been real ever since I could build a verse
For real motherfuckers on this hell on earth, but yeah but my eyes are watching, gotta watch my option, because I'm learnin' to G
Where the block is poppin', yea, the cops are watchin, tryna get themselves on some "he say, she say"
But no, they will never test me
Maneuver to lumens, they'll never catch me
Whatever you do, then you gettin' abused
When you step to my crew, so just come up and see
Believe me, there shouldn't be problems
I come from the block with this goblin
Yes, we all squabblin'
See me just coming, and F-I-R-I-N-G all for my squadron
But see, my bars are just hustlin'
'Fore they get charged with the publishin' (Fuck!)
I'd rather go smash on all of these artists that's out and partially hustlin'
Cause me, I'm lovin' an artist that's hustlin'
Upside it's bubblin, Downside it's bubblin'
But I'd just rather go get it than sit on my ass
Than starvin' and strugglin'

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Niggas, they really want me to bang again
To give up the rap, and go back to aiming thangs
I'm running now whos up in abrasive chains
See, I was set to get up in yo' brain bra-brain
The homies hanging all around me I'm about to snap
I put the heat up to my noggin, they can vouch for that
I have people tellin me that we about to brack
But, fuck it all, I'mma make em say ouch for that
Now I'mma kill 'em
Break up out the womb, and I was dope from the beginning
I was wicked leave yo' brains up on the ceiling
Sick of seein' everybody dyin' round a muthafucka grandmamas and grandchildren
Do you know the feeling?
When somebody that you love is taken from your life
Like a thief in the night?
And makin' sure everybody got weed in they pipe
You want me to burn em up well indeed i ignite
So, I'mma keep walking the path, knowing there's nowhere for me to go but I'mma keep on pushin endlessly
It's like I'm on a one-way trip straight to hell
Oh well, hope somebody in this bitch remember me
And now I'm runnin'
Shit has hit the floor I got the gun up
But you never brushin', know whenever anger hit
It's when you find little kids, like 3 years old
Layin in a puddle of blood up for banging shit
