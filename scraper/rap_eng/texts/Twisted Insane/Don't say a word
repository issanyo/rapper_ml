[Intro]
Don't say a word

[Verse 1: C.Ray]
Everybody underground I don’t side from any of you niggas underrated like I prolly burn grab em by the pussy
Like a penny when I'm pinching
Set up and knock em down I don't need a pen
I’m in the lane I'm independent
Built up for the crown I said they got it
But as soon as they wasn't able to defend it
Hit a piece I really can't believe it
I be trying to watch a movie with the youth
I don't get to see em all the time
Be time I got no time I need a doobie in the booth
I be sick in here I'm bout to ratchet
Did you not get it were re-living the shoot
I be gotta turn around, around
I be coming back into my city with the loot
Treading through the muddy waters in a pair of trunks
And a backpack strap and I'm walking through the crip
And hella faded barley mean it hit the bed
And I would black in and fuck out
Fed up running like a bus route man I really gotta nag for this
Why the fuck they killing me
I don't wanna wonder If I may step off on a mad trooper
So I gotta tone it down even though were heavy with the pain
Just a little take a nigga slap a nigga silly
But they really wanna play like a fiddle
I’ve been holding back the whole time when I done em all
Gon’ make me tip the gas out then I bury
Everybody beep in a world where you beep till you blackout

[Hook: C.Ray]
Don't say a word
Mention me could be history
So easily homie don’t be absurd
My rivals are sideshows bitch I know it hurts
They lonely it's okay just don't say a word

[Verse 2: King Iso]
(BRAIN)
Ain't nobody better than a veteran you better get a bullet
I’ma hit it then never wolf competitors be rowdy
Nigga better get a jersey like James
Settle even dealing with the metal if your ever feeling murky
Kill a fella with the shovel and I bet you kill a rel'
And never tell like Brittany Murphy nigga damn
It's evident the rhetoric I get em with is devilish
Or hurt me I'll burn it till your elements have settled in
And kill em like avenger devil dirty how I bang
You're telling me you're eligible eat em like I medicating edibles
So beat it with you imbeciles and better damn believe it
I will get into you so tell me why you came
Never have I ever been a lame
And I bet you niggas coming at me
They'll get to chopping like propellers to a plane
And fell up on the fellowship replenish it we fake
So we tell em hit the plane
For the niggas not respecting me I bet you all
We check em like teller with the bane
Niggas sticking at the betting but they ain't
They'll be sweeter than an edible arranged
With my feet up on a peddle while I swang
And were leaning out the window with the bang
And proceeding to the ghetto with the gang
Shit I think I nearly said it I'm insane
Anybody really want it with me come and get me
Ain't nobody messing with the king
I'm too heavy for you feather freaking weights
You thinking that your better
But I bet you haven't said it to his face
And when you get in front of me you looking like a dork
Like I'ma 7 to a 8
So when you see me don't say a word
Like do never learn the letter in the grave
Cause I'll cut you into pieces and I wear a niggas skin
Like a leather man ok
I'm really brain sick so better get away
With the 9 mili strange shit with a tech up in your face
I'm the don silly look at other people that you light up in this place and when I try really nigga
You can run a fucking dead list on the brain

[Hook: C.Ray]
Don't say a word
Mention me could be history
So easily homie don't be absurd
My rivals are sideshows bitch I know it hurts
They lonely it's okay just don't say a word

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Dancing with the devil look at what you made him
We could fade it get the bladed
Almost take the mickey
But you wasn't living off forgiving
Listen to me run up bet you wish you doom
I don't give a shit about what you was giving
Just a minute tell the bitch I got witness
Looking at me can away a head and bust it
Might just as well just get the fuck up out the room
Grabbing to get where you reaching for your spoon
Hopping the beat they want to get to you consume
Dropping the conversation bite me to the boom
Pushing up daises
There ain't no murder motherfuckers on the loom
Hitting you bitches all up with the little boon
You was stupid like you were a big buffoon nigga you brazy
They could all be running at me heater runner
Go on put the gun up at me any money really funny
Come and club me
Anyone that pull up from the waist
I be on the voodoo type a ritual a sicker individual
I wish you wouldn't boogie man will get you
When you go to sleep at night to see your fate
Don't you say another fucking word i'm on a thunder bird
And you ain't saying shit
I gotta come and murder don't you worry
I'ma tell your family when they get your break
I don't wanna hear no bitching when i go and get the knife
Up out the kitchen in a minute
She was finna in the mist and knowing now best be a niggas fate prolly leave a nigga leaking just for speaking blood
They all up in the mud
Coming here to get me all his money and his woman
I don't give a motherfuck
Maybe I should tell em I forgive em when they looking for'
I put em in the dust
Someone get the tape and put it on his mouth
Cause i don't really hear him fuss
I don't wanna hear another mother fucking word about it
Should I kill you in the dungeon
One they don't wanna see a nigga when i'm posted with a loaded gun
Two post up in the park and then i'm killing everybody pistol, brain

[Hook: C.Ray]
Don't say a word
Mention me could be history
So easily homie don't be absurd
My rivals are sideshows bitch I know it hurts
They lonely it's okay just don't say a word
