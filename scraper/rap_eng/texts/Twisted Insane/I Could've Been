[Verse 1]
I could've been that one that lurks in the parking lot waiting to get ya
Grab ya, tie you up, throw you in the back of the van then split ya
I could've been that one drunk nigga that went Postal and killed them all...
Fellas, ladies, babies, BRAINS ON THE WALL!
I could've been on night-time shit
Security guard on the night-time shift
Wait for the bitch, then tazer the bitch, get to raping the bitch on the night time tits
I could of been waiting for the right time to hit
Under your bed, or in your closet, I'm gonna get your money deposit
Put it up in the sink I think I already have lost it
I could've been the D.C. Sniper, picking niggas off from LONG RANGE!
I could've been like Charlie Sheen, hella fucked up off of cocaine
You could've been the one to die...
I could've been the one who killed...
I could've been the one who left your face looking like a fucking Seal's
I could've been that, kill'em all up, FUCK'EM All, nigga I don't need no gun
Leave them all bleeding, straight leakin', face looking like they fucking spun...
I'm NOT DONE!
Cut them up, put them in the backyard I could've been that one
MURDER, BLOODY...MURDER, For Fun!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I could've been that one that killed infinite men on that Brainsick
Try to run and hide get caught on the wrong side of that hook I maim with
Hang with nothing but gorillas that be steady bustin' triggers on the enemy
Those who all tried to get rid of me, but I will be right back with like ten of me
I could be the one that you hate for fucking your bitch, I'm incisioned
I could be the one to give two big shits about your criticism
I could be Sickapotamus nigga, I could be The Monster in The Dark. I could be The Root of All Evil for slaughtering people, I have no heart
You could be the sunshine, I could be that... Moonlight
We can have a fun-time
It's the 15th nigga, that's doom night
Drunk as fuck, walking on coals with no shoes, nigga, I'm WASTED, Total, Swerving McGervy, I'm perving like APE SHIT!
