Verse 2 (Twisted Insane)

I be off of weed I'm about to stuff an eighth up in a blunt
Hop up in a circle let em hit it if he want
Take a puff and hit this shit for 50 seconds ain't no punk
I be posted in the back of a Cadillac blowin skunk
Smokin around about a pound a day i hope you get the picture
Somebody better hop up in the whip and get the swisher
I can be high from here until the moon
Smoking weed and eatin shrooms
Maybe if i chew but it be my elixir
One more bar right before i hit the door and go
One more fresh bowl before i hit the liquor store
Homie all i need is just a hit and go
People lookin at me like its really so forbidden though
Homie whatchu splittin for?
Everybody in this motherfucker gettin high up off of weed
You will wanna take a hit indeed
I will match you back to back and keep on stackin with the trees
I wake up in the morning the first thing i gotta do is take a toke
I only wanna smoke up on this shit to make me choke
Shit imagine how much weed that we can fit up on a boat
We should take a trip and homie we can really fuckin float
Did i bring enough so we can load a  bowl up? Check
And bring enough that we can even roll up? Check
My life is always filled with so many so ups did i bring enough liqour so i be laying in my throw up? Yep
I needa roll another one another green thumb
I be fiending for that shit like it's really a fuckin drug
I need it like i need the air i breathe
I take another leaf
And put it in the air becoming with the bud
And everytime im going through some shit
I take a hit to really ease the pain
Roll up when i load up in my spliff
And i do admit that I'm in love with mary jane...brain!
