[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]

Fuck it i get with the murder put em in a coffin
I am abomination with the domination of incredible hulk off of Sherm
If you get a mix up with a nigga then you better know it somebody get burned
Never go reachin' for a nigga wouldn't gimme 50 feed it? till it is yo turn
Nigga betta learn some of us packin' for dollars? and get me on the instrumental
I beat the pussy til the shit is squirtin' pon' a nigga but i wasn't gentle
Maybe its my mental got a motherfucker goin' hella crazy hope he got some denim?
I am a gorilla, run up on a killa, put em in the griddle it is that simple

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]

Any which-a-way you get nigga i'm a rider
Walk up on you when you slippin' and i'm about to get the homie and provide ya
I don't wanna hear another word about the hey you bad about the men that really did it?
