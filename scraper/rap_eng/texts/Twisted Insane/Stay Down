[Hook: Charlie Ray]
When you see me coming, hide ya sound and stay down
No there's nothing you can tell me, y'all are snakes now
And every time I turn around, they got they fangs out
Ain't it hard when friends and enemies the same thing now
There is nobody worth my time if they can't stay down
And they left ya homies chilling when the rain came down
And every time I turn around, they got they fangs out
Ain't it hard when friends and enemies the same thing now

[Verse 1: Charlie Ray]
Yeah, now tell me what I gotta do
