It's triv...
I put that on the set, and if you don't believe me, nigga, come through the [jex?]
Nigga, it's triv...
I put that on the set, and if you don't believe me, nigga, come through the [jex?]
Nigga, it's triv...
I put that on the set, and if you don't believe me, nigga, come through the [jex?]
It's triv...
It's triv...

[Verse 1]
Bang on niggas like it's '84, [I toast to sin?], you can bet that I pound these niggas
Ion' give a fuck where the nigga from, you run up talkin dumb and I drown these niggas
Got some lil homies that'll clown you niggas
Run up on the venom, Blood, I ain't a bitch
Hit a muthafucka with the missile outta a nigga pistol if a nigga really want the ignant' shit
All by myself, with the homies gone, I walk into a room fulla gangsta niggas
Back to the wall when these niggas all muggin, only a matter a' time 'for I bank a nigga
Fuck what you thought, I'm a sick nigga
Real with this shit like a fuckin man
The bitch shows up with anotha nigga - good luck, that's a bitch I can't fuckin stand
Niggas who be actin all tough n' shit, you know the ones that be thinkin they be buff and shit?
Last year, nigga was a lil too skinny, now you're just the right size for my slug to hit
Just the right color for the Bloods to get
Posted outside with the [infa-green?]
Beam on a nigga when I lean on a nigga with the hollow tips out the AR-15, I mean...
(I mean)
Should I really just get this nigga?
Hit em wit a Mac, hit em in the back - never that - put em in a sac, then zip this nigga
Had all lil homies just zip this nigga
Pick em up, then hit this nigga
Fuck what he talkin 'bout, drag a nigga butt-naked all through the set, then split this nigga
