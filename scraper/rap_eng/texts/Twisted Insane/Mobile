[Intro - Twisted Insane]

[Verse 1 - Twisted Insane]

Hit 'em with the psycho shit
They don't want to run up and get done
To fill the body with the motherfuckin' venom
When I get up in 'em, I'ma have to fill 'em with the sick
And everybody trippin' cause I'm rippin' niggas like a denim
I'm a weirdo
But it really doesn't matter
Cause a motherfucker splatter people's ear lobes
And I'm here for
Anybody that wanna get
Take a trip into huntin' on me, the dear ghost
I'm that one in the dark room, kinda like dungeon
Here with the harpoon, (later might punch it?)
Sick, jackin' off with a baboon on a full moon
Off of shrooms and the OE buzzin'
Hit 'em whenever they run up, let me get their ass dummin'
Fuck it, I'ma put 'em in the oven with the roast
Maybe all my bitches had the [?] by the feelin'
We're the great and everybody say they love it at the most
Are you ready for the toast?
He's finna call, people will fall
He kill 'em all, there was no escapin'
Everybody's homies take it deep, fill 'em all
Bleedin' 'em all, he's gonna ball
Kinda like a nightmare
But he's really standing right there
And you know I do not fight fair
Hit him with the mace, kick him in the waist
Shoot him in his face and I'm off
And I win like I'm [flat air?]
I am the monster in the dark
And I'm under your bed and I'm up in your closet
When you go to sleep
And I really murder anybody
In the middle of the night because I creep, dump 'em with the heat
Or maybe get to choppin' off your feet
Stuck in the pit with the big sick python
Wavin' the 44, nigga don't know
Any minute they will get him with the ticking time bomb
