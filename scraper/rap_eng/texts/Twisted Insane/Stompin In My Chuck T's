[A bunch of mumbling]

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Bustin a slug, got your cranium split
Dumpin em at your water melon, leavin a nigga fucked up while his ass runnin like a felon
It ain't no game, [?] name Insane, I'm dumpin em at your fuckin brain, never smokin that cocaine
I like to smoke the green
And off of the bomb weed, [to?] have you fucked, walkin around, [stuck?] like zombies
Nigga, cane ya, fuck around when I dump and nigga cane ya, fuckin around when I squeeze [a masport pump?]
I ain't no jump nigga
I likes to smoke niggas, leavin a nigga fucked up [for smokin on my roast nigga]
It's the way that I approach niggas
That make em a nervous wreck
But I hit what I'm smokin on nigga...
To keep your nerves in check
I'm dumpin away at the stomach, havin ya vomit, mucus, loogies
Suck on tampons, that's why these bitches think I'm Screwy Lewy
I likes to fuck ho's booty
Yours truly, Frankenstein
Diggin up in your beef curtains, till you bleedin from behind and I'm...

[Chorus: Twisted Insane]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Mmmm, mmmm, yeah]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Nigga, this motherfucker nigga, tryna get my shit prepared nigga]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Every motherfuckin day nigga, I be stompin in these mothafuckas, nigga]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[It ain't no game homie, it ain't no game homie, let em know]
Stompin in my Chuck T's...

[Verse 2: Guaran T]
Makin somethin outta nothin, ya gotta know...
Know when to hold em, when to fold em and...
Know when to bluff em if you show...
If you show a nigga's weapon at ya feet then you know you gotta dump em
I track and [packaged this?] heat for streets so you know you gotta bump em
Any [wha]
[And your?] motherfucker think she's sweet, keep holdin that assumption
But not too long, [?]
[She's a ho]
Oh yeah, so bitch [?] think she somethin [tell that bitch]
If it ain't daily, it ain't maybe, it ain't nothin [from the staple to the table]
[?]
Niggas wanna wage war and threaten, it's hot in this kitchen, but see I ain't sweatin
There's pockets in this kitchen, but few can [shev?] it
That I jack their lyrics and few contest, [said?] I jacks their lyrics
If you got that game [?] nigga run wit it
I got somethin your monkey ass won't nigga, come get it
You kept tyrna to do that, nigga, I've done did it
Get that wig split

[Chorus]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[What these muhfuckas don't understand nigga, a nigga is...]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[We'll mash on you homie, ya understand what I'm sayin, we'll fuck you up nigga...]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Leave you bleeedin nigga, no remorse, no remorse when we bust, no remorse when we bust]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[San Diego California ridas nigga]
Stompin in my Chuck T's...

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Bustin at niggas with the [heat to rock a?]
Knockin em off they pedestal, my shit is sick
Leavin yo nuts cooked like vegetables
Hopin up ovah the gate gate with the AK
Leavin that nigga's wife screamin: "MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY!"
That's what you say [when I was cold and?] on the night train
Fuckin em up
Eat bloody duck like [Chinese main!]
And you really do not wanna...
Run up on the real monster
[?] like I'm Chewbacca, stickin the dick up in they [cocka?]
Creepin through the dark
With a mini Mac-10, [the straps?] galore
You think you packin heat...
But nigga, I'm packin more
Cuz I'm the one that's on the run up on niggas and hit em [with metal?]
[Gun?] they feet and put it on griddle
Watch a nigga while I play the fiddle
I've got a fuckin riddle...
For the one to ask the question
He was a man...
But that night, he felt like an adolescent
Cuz niggas get they brains split off in the brainsick
Quit talkin ya raggedy bitch and just pay this
And I was...

[Chorus]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Mmmm, mmmm, yeah]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Nigga we do this muthafuckin shit everyday nigga, daily]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[Stompin in my muthafuckin green Chuck T's nigga!]
Stompin in my Chuck T's
[It ain't no... It ain't no game nigga, let em know]
Stompin in my Chuck T's...
