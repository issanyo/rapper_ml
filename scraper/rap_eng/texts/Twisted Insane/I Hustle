[Verse 1]
I be on the blocks everyday with the Glocks and the Ks and a bag fulla CDs
No flat-tops or a fade, and no Dr. or Dre, just a nigga with street heat
People that be wolfin like a were, man, I really don’t care
'less a person wanna see me
Then I'm walkin all up in the middle of the street with a wife-beater, solo, and a three-piece
And I be all up in the middle of the window whenever they come pushin
And spendin too much time lookin
I’m tellin you I’m hot up in the kitchen whenever they want cookin
Habanero sauce, [that'll be the boss?]
Ain’t nobody comin hotta' than me [and siz em?]
I see em gettin lost when I'm takin off, I be leavin everybody all up in the ditches
(Take off on em!)
I be so ahead of everybody, they be wonderin just how a nigga did it
But I get it when I spit and be [dumpin off?] for the sick
I be leavin em in the dirt [when the men all done cracked his head?]
[In?] a bodybag, Imma zip it
[I'm fundin killin, could R.I.P.?], and I got em all lookin at me cuz I be offa dat shit
If ya lookin to get a hit, I got CDs to getchyou lit
And we gon' burn up everybody that's hatin up in the ditch
I be on a graveyard [ship?] cuz I be pushin in the night, by the gravesite
And I be on the daytime shit cuz I push by the [slight?] in the daylight
24/7, I gotta be steppin in whatever direction if they want my...
Products, CDs, shirts, hoodies, jerseys, beanies, I...

[Verse 2]
They be goin to sleep at night...
Ion' nevah stop
Different city every night, they still on the block
I be on a roll when I not be at home
Everybody want it, so I get em in the zone
Hit em wit the heat and I get all-way gone
Now they lookin at me like I'm next to the throne
[Murderly?], everybody has heard a' me cuz I be burnin rubbers in the third degree
Maybe it will occur to me, all of you wanna murder me cuz all a' my opponents been gettin up in the surgery
"I been offa him since he did Ticklish."
"I dunno why he sound so ridiculous."
"Everyone I know is all gettin into this."
"I can't understand a word he sayin, it's soundin gibberish."
"Twisted Insane... You're in your own lane. You gotta sick brain.  You need to sign with Strange!"
And every single time I hit the stage, I be leavin all the [fades?], lookin like they filled with novacane
I'm [punchin?] everybody, [finna toes to the ring?]
I want everybody from the old to the Yang
I want everybody from the king to the sick
I want everybody from the school to the gang
Here we go again - [we're wit it?] when I spit it, gotta get it when I been off, [ain't nun'n when I hit it?]
[When I throws?] em in a pen - toss! - send em in the river [with a nigga 'til the squim frost bit em?]
Er'body on me...
We gon' give it to em on three
New CDs, fresh DVDs, brand-new Ts, a fat sac a' weed
And if ya lucky then maybe a couple a' O.E.s, I…

Twisted Insane!
Let the beat ride, mmmm
