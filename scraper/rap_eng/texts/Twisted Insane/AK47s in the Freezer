[Hook: Twisted Insane]
I got AK47's in the freezer
I got AK47's in the freezer
I got AK47's in the freezer
I got AK47's in the freezer
Feels like I'm drowning, drowning in pussy
Lil' niggas on my nerves, man I swear they gon' push me
I don't wanna be around 'em, I ain't no rookie
You gon' have to pack a gun, bigger than the one that you pushing
Bitch you don't get it, maybe I'm too wicked
You gon' be up in the ground quick, if you do not make it
Aaah, follow the leader
There's no way to win, you've run into the reaper

[Verse 1: C-Mob]
Bring pain and I maim lames when I dump
Aim thangs, then I bang bang, let your veins drain in the trunk
Maintain with the brain gang and I rain flames on a punk
You're not in the same lane, you're a plain Jane and you can't hang with us chump
Where's my pump? I think I left it where the chainsaws at
Brains all splat, no love puttin' four slugs in your kangol hat
People so trife, get the bow knife, I'mma change all that
They got no life, I got more stripes than a Bengal back
AKâ€™s in the freezer, pistols in the cooler
Level up until I gleam gold, I'm like king cold with the Ruger
I'm ill and see I do the, prime villainy a user
Of my ability of killin' I prefer the nine millimeter Luger
Shooters on the rooftop with heads in the crosshairs
Why does every rapper think they're what Pac said was a boss player?
Off their, rocker, it's great when I shot ya
Purify 'em when I dump 'em in the waters of lake Minnetonka
Off the wall like MJ in seventy-nine
Don't stop 'till I get enough, I'mma hit 'em up, enemies dyin'
We shine, never decline, we grind in the meantime
See I'm so gone you approach wrong, better rewind
Up to my neck in feline
It's like I'm drowning
People telling me to be kind
Bitch I been clownin'
Give 'em this pain when I grip and take aim
C-Mob and Twisted Insane, sick in the brain

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Blood stains when the slugs came in the dark
Nine times out of ten I'm gonna sin, aiming at your heart
But to fuck your proposition, led and drug 'em to the basement just so we could start
Coming face to face you tried to plead the case and it was just a waste, I tore his ass apart
The last demon crept through the door slow with the fro, brain so sick
I don't wanna have to blast hun, I'll be the last nigga, better tame your bitch
Run them in the gas, then I let a match burn them in a flame so thick
Leave them dying in they feces, cut them up in pieces blood so we can feed your pits
Real life cannibal, mind state of an animal
Pop your cantaloupe, put a clip in and make you smilin' bitch and make it so you can't elope
There's no antidote, no fucks given, no luck for the masked men
Ask when you was finna die? Nigga no lie you ain't lasting
Face bashed in, I am sin, I got bloody guts in the floorboards
With four more whores torn I don't give a motherfuck
Automatic heaters and an eye out for the peepers and AK's all in my freezer
Man I'm on a mission, [all I feel take 'em all for a ride?]
Everybody thinking it's a party and they drinking on Bacardi, getting faded but they really finna die
I got murder in my eye, think about it before you wanna lie
Call you they were looking for your ride, run up on you with the pot, peel you up and then take your life
Ain't nobody stopping even if the niggas fried, semi-automatic lie
I'mma have to go into the freezer, get the heater up, then run up in the house
Hide up in the bathroom while their coming down the hallway, I'mma hop out like I'm 'bout to show my niggas what I'm 'bout
You won't make it out the house
Came in this bitch 20 deep on a creep and looking for a lick
And your homies got to running from me leaving you alone, and isn't that some shit?
I've got-
