[HOOK] (0:11)

Run it run it run it run it
Oh you got a problem better bring it to our face
Run it run it run it run it
Now you got a problem cause you fucking wit some apes
Run it run it run it run it
Only way to solve it is to come and get the fade
What the brain is bout, we don't fuck wit fakes
You keep my name in your mouth cause you love the taste, i tell em

Run it run it run it run it
Hold up you think you can't get pilled?
Run it run it run it run it
Run up on you and this shit get filmed
Run it run it run it run it
Oh you owe me that bill?
So you think you that ill?
Oh you think this ain't real?



[VERSE 1: Twisted Insane] (0:39)

I'm mellow wit the heat rollin
Niggas wanna go to war but they gon keep folding/
You can talk about me if you really want to, shit well
I'ma step up to the line and shoot like i'm freethrowin/
The 40 bottle got me faded
Dickies hanging to the floor so gang related/
Anybody wit it they be wolfin
"like to pull it 1 on 1 don't get a gun"?? i thought you really wanna fade?// (Whats brackin nigga)

And I ain't got no cheat codes
You be walking round like you some kind of super hero, zero/
Thoughts about you comin with yo people
I been lookin all around and homie ain't no equal/
I be on tint, pull up on the jet black "swint"??
No cadillac tires, no rims/
Where do I begin? I been rappin since 11 years old
Brainsick hoe, I don't need friends// (hahaha)

And they tell me that i'm evil
A little wicked when I get in your cerebral/
But i just wanna "share the hand with all my people"??
So you ain't gotta run when I pull in the regle/
He's lethal, people tell me i'm the G.O.A.T
Gimme instrumental and that's murder that she wrote/
Everybody drown nigga don't nobody float
Face down way down got a pound we can smoke nigga//

... oh what is it too soon?
"tryna get brained"?? on the full moon/
Can't meet the family i'm "too woon"??
Are they scared of what ima do to em?/
Ain't nobody in the home i'm posted
Right in front of your apartment all night/
Here he come pullin out fresh off of work
Soon as he get out the whip, BRAINSICK take flight, trill//

[VERSE 2: DIKULZ] (2:04)

What you got a problem?
"get ready if you want to"??/
Fists rain down like a monsoon yea they all floatin down here
Bodies in the water floatin like a pontoon/
Super villian no costume, i don't need one
No mask see my face when i aim n poke/
I finna roll up "  "?? your eyes swoll shut
Till you lookin out slits like them asians folks//

... yea, talk is cheap i got expensive taste/
See you offered a drink and wanna mess with apes
So talk soft and that sauce get you extra "phased"??/
I'm not playin, fuck what they sayin
They complain and they growl but they make no sounds/
Can't fuck wit the brain, no way no how
Betta bow out now 'fore that thing go blow// (BARAAAAIIINNN)

Hear that? well it's too late for you
Oh well i don't dwell on that shit/
Rather go and take piss
While your family leave a boquet for you/
I be chillin in the middle of a dark night
If i see a shadow then you know it's on sight/
Yea, everybody CAN get it and they will
Ima hit em wit a left if they all right//

... we don't care who it is
Or where you may be if you there with your kids/
You get caught starin n shit
Get knocked out and embarrass your kids/
I won't stand for the bullshit
Nuh uh gotta keep it one hundred/
Bout to get blunted, slide out
Hit the whitehouse and then say, ay, homie lets//
