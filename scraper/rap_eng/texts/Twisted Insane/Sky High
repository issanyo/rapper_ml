[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
I used to take her with me
Everywhere a nigga went
Sipping on her every day
That’s where my time was spent
I used to hold her hand
And kiss her on the lips
A bottle or a can
I swallowed every drip
I was the talk of the town I could always be found in some kind of a ditch
Or handcuffed in the back of a van ain’t that 'bout a bitch
All my bitches' parents used to say they know how to pick 'em
But on the real though, when I looked in the mirror, nigga, who was I kiddin'
If I keep going this route I will end up dead in a coffin
Every now and then, shit, I’m doing this often
I’m already lost in some kind of a daze and minimum wage
Doesn’t pay shit I got too many bills for me to even stay, shit
I’m Brainsick
I’m hard of hearing
I stay lit
In the bars on weekends
Any minute it might be my limit
And I’m off the deep end
They want me to quit her
But that liquor it is on my beak and

[Chorus]
I’m sky high, faded to the maximum
I’m sky high, spent so many racks I’m numb
I’m sky high, I can’t hear or see you, see
I’m sky high, so much on my mind so I stay high

[Verse 2: Charlie Ray]
I’ve been off'a the weed and off'a the liquor too
But for good reason I’m off of the drinkin' so this spliff’ll do
See I be on blackout status
When I’m sippin that vodka fruit
Then I wake up in the morning scared to look at my wallet
Spent a lotta loot
With nothing to show but a couple of days in bed with an aching head
But I got me the dro with a couple of flavors fed, I raise the dead
Then I get back on my game, forget about hoes an get off on the music
Cannabis keep me on top of shit high like a monolith, that way I know I don’t lose it
You can blame Twisted Insane for it
He done put me on game and sicked me on y’all to catch you with the flamethrower
You were sittin' on ya ass I was in the lab try'na get paid for it
Put you rappers in a bag we can make it drastic and get ya veins flowing
And speaking of veins I gotta clot in mine
Right in my lung, this here is no fun, I pray I don’t drop and die
Yeah it’s kinda scary
I think I’m off the deep end
They want me to quit her
But my Mary she is on my beak and

[Chorus]
I’m sky high, faded to the maximum
I’m sky high, spent so many racks I’m numb
I’m sky high, I can’t hear or see you, see
I’m sky high, so much on my mind so I stay high
