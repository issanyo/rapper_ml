Verse One (J. flyer)

Yeah, I'm the chosen one
Keep a fat bag full of frozen bud
Always on a rap and i might have fun
Always on a rap and i might get funds
Luger's in the bag you don't see no gun
But the AK-47 leave ya slumped like one
And when i come in spittin i can dunk like one
Click click bat bat leave the chum dumb dumb
Bang back of a motherfucker too damn close
I can use some personal space and a few fats rolled
I can use and murder your face in a cruise that's cool
Give your neck a lil twist oooo fast foward
Now i gotta get blunt
Not a rap not a gram but i gotta confront
That fake shit
All the time wasted
Everything is so watered down I can't taste shit
All these motherfuckers wind down my patience
Tell her and I'm running through em with that J shit
Im comin to you when my shit is  like jason
Cut your mic cords like dreads on a 'hatian
Fuck yo dreams like freddy in a basement
Watchu niggas sleep tight never gon' awaken
Cause you fuckin realize you ain't  gonna make it
And until the mean time I be gettin faded, uhhh
They ain't got a god damn thang on me
I can rap a circle 'round space homie
Fly back to the lab with K homie
I say homie i say
And i killin this shit everyday
Ain't you feelin this heat that i spray?
Pay attention I leave it to brain

Hook (C Ray) x2

Now it will cost everyone dearly
If you're not pay attention raise your hand if you can't hear me
Schools in session learn a lesson shut your mouth and listen clearly
Here we come to tune the station place your fate if you dont fear me here we come

Verse Two (Dikulz)

Mainstream sucks dick, I ain't fuckin with that or a letter of bullshit to bring the numbers in
Me? I'm with me brethren hoverin smotherin artists so they could all feel the sufferin
Yeah, then I'm seamed to the pillow case
See you put my damn bullshit out the pillow K
Finna lunge in the cab or when i jump out the back go bash your head on the dash till the window breaks
Uh, Yeah, thats real
Loui get you finna prada thats skill
Shit i was raised on that wordplay where you heard that one verse and your shit got chills
Used to get that feel, try to listen now but it makes me rethink
Cause the beat's weak and the spitsly retweet and the hook's stuck on re-re-re-repeat
Fuck em, shit's whack
Fucked it all up I mean look where shit's at
Never shoulda touched it just left it intact
Now we just movin tryna bring shit back
Man it's all mismatched
Tryna get the dough but the witch get cash
Fuck it, too hard than the own risk that
Sacrificed it all hope we get shit back
Sellouts, ain't a slave to the industry
Ain't no way you can cage my imagery
Or rearrange my chemistry
Yeah niggas quick to sell out and they change their identity
Huh, better bite your tongue
Better not say shit unless they prompt you
Shit, over here at Brainsick we do whatever the fuck we want to

Hook (C Ray) x2

Now it will cost everyone dearly
If you're not payin' attention raise your hand if you can't hear me
Schools in session learn a lesson shut your mouth and listen clearly
Here we come to tune the station place your fate if you dont fear me here we come

Verse Three (Twisted Insane)

Im like a Freddy and the jason
Waitin
Fitted with the wicked and the evil you would think that it was satan
Like i was a zombie 'tack invade em if i chase em maybe they will run away and if they come back I'll erase em
Ima monster in the dark, a fiend for this shit black magic in the night time and im on one
Heat em up, kill em off and make em feel the pain puttin a bullet in his brain and a bud up in his lungs
Im Lucifer and i always pack a burner
Turn a  watermelon to a motherfuckin turnip
Burn up, any individual who turn watch a nigga body squirm when a nigga shit worm guts
Burn got to post up all alone up in the dark
And givin niggas pressie i dont really have a heart
You raised by the guppies i be swimmin with the sharks
I'll burn your house down and then i put my shit in park
And ima watch that shit melt
Felt, the hand that you was dealt
When you do know what they call me vetity
Who risen from the grave bring your dark days throw em in a cage lock em up and then i throw away the key
Now who was you meant to be? who me?
Indeed i be a monster
Brainsick, I was sent to motherfuckin conquer
On a, nother mission ima go bazonkers
And turn into a demon when I'm dead then ima haunt ya
Dazed by the phenom, dreamin to be the last motherfucker standing up I'll be the last demon
Tell me whats the name of that amine is
Smokin on sativa the fluid in my cup got me heenin
I was in a corner steady leanin
Strap on my waist lookin like i wanna take a nigga life
One slip up and i be up at your house with a new chainsaw and a motherfuckin knife, brain!

Hook (C Ray) x2

Now it will cost everyone dearly
If you're not pay attention raise your hand if you can't hear me
Schools in session learn a lesson shut your mouth and listen clearly
Here we come to tune the station place your fate if you dont fear me here we come
