[Intro]
In this country you got to make the money first
Then when you get the money you get the power
Then when you get the power, then you get the woman

Shrooms, ecstasy, alcohol, and the weed, heroin
Overdosin', crystal-meth, pick your poison

[Verse 1: Twisted-Insane]
If I take another hit
Then I'ma have another fit
And get to talkin' to my seat belt
Really get to zonin'
When I really get to rollin'
The homie told me you know I know exactly just how he felt
Hit em all up I hide behind my heat
Feelin' like I was trippin' 'cause I couldn't feel my feet
I'm running up on the deep
And I'm right about to leap
And why the fuck can't I stop grinding my teeth
Pick your poison and bring your boys in
I got the toys and they go through niggas
Fully loaded clips when I'm off a trip
You don't really wanna see the shit I'll show you niggas
My heart is beatin' quicker
Maybe it was the pill or maybe it was the liquor
You feel like superman when your drinkin' from my elixir
But there ain't nobody stoppin' this venom I will deliver
And I want more seepin' into my pores
Got me sicker than a horse
Even if it was yours
I will leak it up on the floor
Have you wiping up the blood and semen when you do your chores
And I don't really care about how sober you are when you walkin' because you are gonna leave lit!
You can shoot it, you can light it
You can sniff it, you can shit
I got a million different ways for you to take a fuckin' hit
Pick your poison

[Chorus: Charlie Ray]
Over doses in bottles or baggies take your pick
Dawg you ain't had enough if that shit ain't make you sick
We in the street for that profit to get them pockets swoll
Now get to pickin' your poison and watch that rocket go

Shrooms, ecstasy, alcohol, and the weed, heroin
Overdosin', crystal-meth, pick your poison

[Verse 2: Charlie Ray]
Huh, now a nigga like me
I ain't fuckin' with the powder see I'd rather really pop a pill
Chase it with a little bit of liquor hit the Mary got me feelin' like I got some helicopter skills
And when I thought I was done there's more after
My niggas lookin' at me like dawg you gonna have ta
The hits on me and since I'm in the rotation I betcha
That I'll make it to Mars before NASA
Now shut the fuck up and give me a pain pill
So I can remain chill
And stay in the game still
Otherwise I'll be dealing with pain
Irritable and ready to murder somebody there's nobody I can't kill
You niggas better lay off or it's Adolf
Put a motherfucker in a oven with the steak sauce
But I probably hit the weed and forget and burned my fuckin 'house down you can see that I'm sick so
Whatever just make sure I'm loaded
So I can take my mind off of this ho shit
I see so much of this dosage
'Cause y'all niggas disrupt my focus
And I just wanna be numb
See I don't care what it is so give it up or I'ma have to stick a sword in
They probably wonderin' who the hell let the boys in
Twisted Insane and C.Ray pick your poison

[Chorus: Charlie Ray]
Over doses in bottles or baggies take your pick
Dawg you ain't had enough if that shit ain't make you sick
We in the street for that profit to get them pockets swoll
Now get to pickin' your poison and watch that rocket go

Shrooms, ecstasy, alcohol, and the weed, heroin
Overdosin', crystal-meth, pick your poison
