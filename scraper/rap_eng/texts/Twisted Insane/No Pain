See, I come through
(Nose hard as spoon?)
And they hopin' that I lose
The world is filled with spiders
Just the same old thang
But I keep movin', I take my lumps
And I take my bruises through this
Very simple principle: no pain, no gain

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
I travel through the rain with no umbrella
I just space and come in face to face with demon
Did I mention, never listen when the gun tick
Half of the time we never know what it is meanin'
I wanna be a rapper, they would tell me I was dreamin'
Probably cause they always saw me sleepin' in the park
Post up with the homies every day and I was chiefin'
But I never had nowhere to go when it was dark
And I, I was always norm
I was gonna make it, keepin' it pushin' just to show 'em
Always had a dream that I would be up on a TV
And these bitches fuss on me and say
"Shit, I don't fuckin' know 'em"
Well bitch you fuckin' blew it
I wanna give you the time and day
So get 'em all away (amazed?)
I've been fuckin' alive in that bitch
The clubs used to make me but I reside to this bitch
Now they want me to come around and just get high in this bitch cause
I was already known
One day they would try to put me and I would say "naaa"
I don't need to be a menace
But I walked around my canvas
And I'm kinda like a dentist
"Baby open up, say: aaa"
I really wish you got some kind of head up with this shit
I knew that you would never really lead up with this shit
Kamikazi come and get me but I'm fed up with this bitch
I'ma make her feel the heat and put some leather in this bitch

[Verse 2: Kamikazi]
I travel through the rain with no umbrella
Nobody gets me, I live with this on my thought
For all of my life I just wanted to be a part of something
Somebody cross me off for my lonely attend to walk
Buryin' myself a spark
For hangin' out of the dark
The shadows, they movin'
I'ma pursue the root of the heart
Now come off Ruber
My attitude is due to these sharks, they ruthless
I gotta learn it, the movement groove in my art
This has been my dream since way before my teams
I was in my mama's belly
Keep the rhythm to the deep
Just playin' Sugarhill Gang
Kurtis said they cheap but
Daddy wasn't around much
I heard he'd like to be hooked
Guess what I'm tryna say?
It's no matter why I'll be stayin' in this
One thing that never turned on me, so I learned to use it
And if only you knew why they got me through
And I must not be confused
Whatever the circumstances, we had some music
Seems like a lifetime, made it on my right mind
Still chasin' dreams, am I really need a life line?
Lookin' for the nice guy
Drive like I might die
Right upon a time Tech N9ne came with Einstein
Pullin' 'em up into my fight
Try severin' the venomous cocaine
Whatever the weather
I better myself to help with the homie Insane
Weather is filthy so outside
Turn around and wrap up this game
But I wanna take the pain and make gains
To see what I might find
No pain
