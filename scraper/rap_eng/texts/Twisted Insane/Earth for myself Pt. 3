This that 666 shit, you wanna meet the last demon, come see Twisted will give you all the business
Since 10th grade I always did that shit that paid, shoutout to Brainsick for fucking with me I get paid, i got it made
So they will have maids, everybody gotta have ways when you’re doing the shit because you really can’t even be new in this shit
The rap games is flooded with all these newbies and shit, they blow dubious and quit, they make movies about the shit
So what the fuck is wrong with that image plot, after to it take nowadays because if you [press square?]
I gotta stop and stare, look at the plotting snare but it got me here, I’m just doing my best so bout to call me here
Wait till we overseas till you see where we at in the next 10 years, you won’t be here you probably won’t even be near

[Verse 4: JC Blu]


[Verse 5: HOUSE]


[Verse 6: Mister Hyde]
I got the whole wide world in the palm of my motherfuckin' hand
The way it stands, they don't have to understand
It's the way that i am, don't give a damn what you think
You should of seen this shit coming like you were planned to get hit
Mark it off of the calender, happy holidays!
Sit in amazement, with the picture we paintin'
All together on the canvas, we all over America
With the number of characters, bitch starin'
We airing ya' and wearin' ya'
And we're in ya' area
Catch a plane if we (?) ya'
In ya face with the (?)
Matter of fact, (?) You aren't prepared for this

[Verse 9: RC Tha Hazard]


[Verse 10: Arkatec]

This world is mine for the taking
Fucking with the Ark I’ll leave you vacant, you ain’t matter
Me and you will never be adjacent
And you finna get offended by the way I leave your brain matter stained on the pavement
You fake and the veins scatter, roll over the place now your fragrance is hate that'll
Put you in a grave when I pull and rush a sword, decapitate you all when you screamin out, hey batter
Never wanna get up in the way when I slay faggots
Drag em down to hell when I leave in oblivion
I control the round that you’re facing and gain status, of a living legend who’s fucking with me- really none
Flames i've already brung, aim at your petty lungs
Brace for your fate, you be vaping cause anyone
Tryna make a statement, we’ll pay with your life cuz a fully loaded chamber raised, why does everyone
Say that I’ve been illuminated from the dark sky
I am just a messenger and pain is what I’ve archived
I’ve seen it all, my place of worship in my heart lies
I will never bow before an idol that’s when art dies
When I’m bustin motherfuckers they refer to I
As a different kind of caliber that's cursin, why?
You don’t really want it when I merge your spine
With a semi-automatic you can squirm and die
You can burn in fire when i purge cause I’m
Feeling motivated when it’s murder time
Killing every individual that surges high, to divert to Christ and the world is mine

[Verse 11: Eradicate]

They say “Eradicate’s that demon when you look into the mirror,“ can’t remember that you’re fucking with a demon, talking
Imma get a motherfucker like he’s rock soft, pop tops off, anybody come around you get sprayed like you’re Lysol
I be licking on that pussy like it’s motherfucking licorice, sticking my dick up in that bitch till I ain’t fucking living, shit
Cause I promise y'all don’t really fucking want it when i bust up on the corner with the chopper cause they ain’t no stopping shit
Earth for myself, did it right by myself, since a little fucking kid I ain’t never got no help
But I’m coming up in that bitch I’m bout to give y'all a chalk line, fuck the TSA I bring my gun on the airline
Hijack the plane I’m bringing it right to your house boy, park it up in the grave yard, burn em with aluminum alloy
I’m talking about the Devil, bringing em to the bottom level when I get up on the pedal boy there ain’t no stopping me
Shooting blood vessel when I whip em with the pistol boy, ask your fucking bitch if my dick is still a issue. When I’m popping up on the pussy she ain’t never gon miss you
I’m bout to call Brainsick, bitch And make it official
Swear ain’t nobody really fucking with that Beast Mode Division, any motherfucker banging better sit down and listen
Pussy faggot bitch, you can get dumped on like a dump truck, in the Southside, boy you can run up any day and see how we ride
I’m Eradicate, that motherfucking pit master, molded in the dark with no heart with no answer
Throw em in the bushes ain’t nobody fucking looking, thinking about my life and a wife, I’m so stupid
How in the fuck is this bitch still moving, shit I might as well eat her pussy, start chewing
About to head to my old school start shooting, DIY, till I die, bitch I stay booming

[Verse 12: Twistid Rob]


[Verse 13: Twisted Insane]

The earth is mine, put it in the palm of my hand, then walk up to a muthafucka talkin' ‘bout a bitch I had blended, I could be fucked and covered in duck skin and get stranded, if you really wanna go to war, get the millimeter and hit 'em like a rabbit, goddamnit! Ain’t nobody on my level when I be shootin’ ‘em like a devil, I’m too sick for my own good, nigga, that’s real talk, bang bang bang, hit 'em in their brains, shoot 'em near the sidewalk, I shoot niggas in the face and look at brains on the dry wall. Murder, how can they be on my earth when I bust through this verse? Holla! Things I bust through a nigga’s brain is work, niggas don’t wanna meet me 'cause I’ll put their bodies in the desert, then run up in a bitch’s pussy, shoot a bullet in it, and see how much that shit’s worth. Puma, tip homie: don’t trip out, I’m so brained out, I might come in your room while you’re sleepin’ and blow your brains out, don’t ever take my route, I be on the highway triple 6 holdin' my dick with my bitch and my thang out. It coulda been nice to meet you, but goddamn, I’m out though, you ain’t gotta say a word especially with your mouth open, I’m up in hell, so I might as well send a bitch up for the torture ‘til I come back with the shit that I’m in doubt for. I put their body in the trunk, there’s no other way, then have 'em go ahead and give it to me, speakin’ of a nigga, I start to spit at the minute, cut the bitches up and see how they think of it. This is my earth, fuck the whole world, I just had to squirt it in your own girl, you been drinkin' too much fool, get offa the brew, and hit the toilet, bitch go oral. I’m brainsick and I’m lovin' it, got the planet in my hand, damn, I’m the man, shit, said you was gon' takeover, though you was gon' do it, but when it came to it, you can’t flick it like, damn

[Verse 14: Yung Statz]

These motherfuckers would’ve never thought I’d be charging that much foolish a cost, and if you feel I shouldn’t be charging for verses then you can fuck off
You mad because your bitch been sucking me off and I’m bout to chop it on your ass so you ain’t proving me wrong, shit
The homies all stay with me, the whole top of Brain will mill who the fuck came to deal with who the fuck came with me
See this shit isn’t plain to see, I got this Earth for Myself, mind’s coming down and you will never try to go with it, tame the East, a timber wolf beast
I shapeshift into a vampire, bite you in the neck with my fucking teeth, don’t ever fuck with the Braniacs, especially the ones on the East like Yung Statz of BMD
Shoutout to ISO for making me such a dope ass beat, and everyone who was part on this shit on part 1, 2 and 3, you all killed the shit
Show em how we came to eat, we came to feast who came for peace, gave em warning they deceased, the murder rate was increased
All because they never sweet, all of us killing no matter how hard you could go on your beat, if you let us, I got this Earth for Myself as we speak
You owe me credit worse too don’t try to come around acting like you brand new or something, because the shit ain’t even new
You try fucking with a few, keeping it 100 is what I do, when you see us, you’re a fool and I’m a genius, I’m apocalypse
You can not defeat me, because my world ain’t easy, my planet Earth needs me and you can’t beat me
