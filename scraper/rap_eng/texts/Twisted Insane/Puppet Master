[Verse 1: Bishop AKA Young Bop]
(Yeah)
Straight from the worshop, dead in the dungeon
It is what it is, they wanna treat me like a puppet
Kids with the sickness, they like it and they love it
Pain and suffering gets hotter than the oven
Twilight skies with the lights getting dim
Raised like a caged doing life in the pen
Blow like a grenade when I slide out my pen
My crazy evil ways got me way on a limb
Anger management says I need to vent
Dancing with the Devil, bust my every sin
They tried to throw a money wrench in my blueprint
Psycho alumni, I'm a student
Gloves on my hand, blood shed and laughter
Scared of the church, never listen to the pastor
I am a factor, when they pulling on my strings from a master
(Yeah)
The gutter got my heart covered with icycles
Bitches wanna ride me like a tricycle
So hot that I sizzle living in Sacramento
Keep it lit like I'm  candle jumping like Jack Be Nimble
Screws in my wig, got a split personality
My body nigga would come and study my anatomy
(?) Let me kiss anc check I got the cavity
Purple haze got me in a place with no gravity
Focus, with no emotion like a mannequin
I'm sharper than the sword, I got the force like Anakin
Panicking, thinking about the shit that I been landed in
My hoe a psychopath, she got me flashing like a camera lens
Gloves on my hand, blood shed and laughter
Scared of the church, never listen to the pastor
I am a factor, when they pulling on my  strings from a master

[Hook]
(In the workshop, lonely soul
Where I was born like Pinocchio
You never imagined a place so cold
There's the place where the hopeless go
Pulling on my strings puppet master can't escape his hold
The hold done made me tired but the fire is still blazing on) x 2

Oh wise Puppet Master, pulling on my strings
Show me there's life after, far beyond these strings
Fall in to a deep trance, dancing as I sing
Follow me to the sweet land
Where there's a place for you and me

[Verse 2: Bishop AKA Young Bop]
(Yeah)
A wasted of a skitzo, still blade packin
Situation critical, I'm in a straight jacket
Houdini could show you this form of black magic
At midnight, you could hear me creeping through your attic
Put it down for my town from the clown like It
Underground is where I'm found, where my sound is sick
My skin look like butter, when I'm cutted on my wrist
Baby let me touch it unless she lustin for the dick
Insane and twisted
When I kick it, I try to restrain but my brain is shifted
I'm infecting the speakers, the reefer keep me lifted
Protecting my creatures where evil existed
Gloves on my hand, blood shed shed laughter
Scared of the church, never listen to the pastor
I am a factor, when they pulling on my strings from a master
I'm from a place off  the map, come and take a visit
Hustle and grit'll get the way most scratched
Based on that
Baby girl is with me and she let me hit it like a baseball bat
I've been gone in the dreams, a yadda yadda mean
Her father gonna hate that I've got her on my team
It's nothing, I get to cuttin like the Wolverine
Fire got me higher (?)
No hatchet killer, Michael Jackson thriller
Take a nigga head off like his neck had a zipper
Pop a couple adderall, mix it with the liquor
I'm a Kottonmouth King, I smoke like Johnny Richter
Gloves on my hand, blood shed and laughter
Scared of the church, never listen to the pastor
I am a factor, when they pulling on my strings from the master

[Hook]
In the workshop, lonely soul
