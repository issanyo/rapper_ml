[Verse 1]
I used to jack off in the night time and write rhymes lumpy
Get my kicks off and I take off like a two face bumpy
Watchin these bitches on TV that's bigger than Humpty Dumpty
I am the shit and only sport outfits that's greener than Gumby
And I get the type of attention that Denzel Wa-
Shington would get if he walked through the sick car wash
Bitches jumpin up and pullin out titties, pussy squirting
They never thought for the day that they'd ever see me in persons
They got me posted with the Chinese dude in the room
Looks like the kid from Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom
But he was cool and had shrooms in the basement and taken
And I'd be alright if his fingers didn't start lookin like bacon
It could'a been good night in the casket and then I was ghost nigga
Take a thing for the casa roll, put the blunt on a toast nigga
Dice it up with pepper and eggs, scrabble with it
Wild out, take a shit on your fortune
And then say that Nick Cannon did it

[Hook]
He don't care about no bitch and he's always on his grind
With a fat ass sack, a Cadillac and a big ol' King Kong dick
I used to jack off in the night time and write rhymes lumpy
Get my kicks off and I take off like a two face bumpy (bad motherfucker)
He's the shit

[Verse 2]
Known for the take off with your face off like Helter Skelter
Tramp with the bane, then eat his brain like it's a Hamburger Helper
Keep right out the ill punchline and had him with them
But I gas faster than Carl Lewis without the faggot in him
You think you be the only one bustin'
You gon see us clear out when niggas sign It's some nuisance next
I play circles around niggas and rope you under the table
And liquid asses got shit from the clit to the nail
I mean diamonds in your pussy piercing, real custom
Thinking about pussy and dimond makes me wanna bust one
I got a big ol' King Kong dick, big and girthy
Love when bitches suck on my shit like it's a slurpee
I love a bitch whose pussy squirt and get gummy
But not more than love a bitch who work and get money
And I'm a fiend for the Brainsick nympho
Feeding her fried bear and hair
Don't be scared for them signal

[Hook]
He don't care about no bitch and he's always on his grind
With a fat ass sack, a Cadillac and a big ol' King Kong dick
I used to jack off in the night time and write rhymes lumpy
Get my kicks off and I take off like a two face bumpy (bad motherfucker)
He's the shit

[Verse 3]
I'm in the room with the O.E bottle and the porno
And I'd rather take porchetta sauced up over digiorno
And you say a nigga ain't no saint, bitch bonjourno
And I'm sick of this four braids that I'm normally cornrow
I call it the advanced playa writing for no scrubs
I hit you niggas fucking up and tryin' fix it on the dubs
Would they say a nigga went mainstream
Even if I cut off your bitches arm and fucked her with it 'til the shits gangrene?
I mean I gotta be the god damn man, eating all that spam
Hold on a minute while I open this can
*opens can and drinks*
That's the ticket
Shoot you in the stomach for another hole for me to stick my dick in
I'm in the kitchen off a bowl of Top Ramen
I turn the omen to amen
And I ain't rich little bitch I'm not common
I'm a nigga that'll shoot that thang
And put two in your brain
Leavin' them stains 'cuz they fuck with the game, Twisted Insane

[Hook]
He don't care about no bitch and he's always on his grind
With a fat ass sack, a Cadillac and a big ol' King Kong dick
I used to jack off in the night time and write rhymes lumpy
Get my kicks off and I take off like a two face bumpy (bad motherfucker)
He's the shit
