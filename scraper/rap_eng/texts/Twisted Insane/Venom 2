[Chorus: Twisted Insane]
Imma hit you with 1-8-7, only when you fucking with them killers
The realest, nigga you was dealing with Godzilla
The illest, you King Kong, I'm banana peeler
Pop you with the milla, you know it that there ain't nobody iller Imma hit 'em with the venom
Gotta hit 'em with the venom
Blood I hit 'em with the venom
Imma hit you with the venom
Call your momma tell her that I did it
Blood I hit em with the venom

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Niggas wanna wolf all night
Put the phone down lets meet up blood I wanna just fight
Fuck this rap shit, lets hit the park,  I done wanna just squabble
I ain’t Superman, but I put it on my momma nigga you will get wobbled
Hit 'em with the 1-2 combo, what you wanna go I got my cardio on just so I can deal with you bitches. (On the set)
Mano y manoI, I lump you niggas up and then I leave your eye lid full of stitches. (On the set)
Lets hit the ditches, take a nigga’s chucks to the mud
You call me and then think I won’t show?
Bitch please nigga I’ma Lincoln Park blood
Green flag hanging, chuck t’s swanging
The sun goes down nigga, bullets start ringing
Everybody in this motherfucker gathered up, then I show up drunk like nigga this lincoln
The fuck is you thinking?
I catch a fade with all of you niggas
You can even jump me, slap my face in the dirt but my AK will come back and swallow you niggas
Knocking niggas out that’s why I spend all my time in the fucking weight room (Lifting)
So when I hit you motherfuckers all in your lip it’s a one way trip to the tomb (You crazy)
Yeah, I heard that before, by every bitch I ever fucked with
But all these ratchet ass bitches got niggas on my phone talking bout some fuckin' shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: King-ISO]
Shit, niggas thinking it be all rapping. (Man fuck this rap shit nigga)
Wolfing all up on the internet I wanna vim and start acting
(What’s good my nigga?)
Be up at these shows and I snuck a gun in just in case I gotta wet y'all niggas
On the set for rap, if it wasn’t for the music but I never would’ve met y'all niggas
I be on my A wax all outta shape, doesn’t really matter gotta Glock on my waist
But I don’t give a fuck how big blood is if a nigga try me getting mopped in the face
Young brazy ass nigga that i’ll kill if I have to it’s good I ain’t tripping
All rapping ass niggas act hard but it’s funny how i’m young and got you shook like bitches
Nigga talk big but they won’t walk one, talk about fade but they ain’t caught one
Imma disrespect niggas so motherfucking bad, have em lured at the pad, like nigga spark one
I ain’t fucking with you foul ass niggas, know where i’m at but don’t wanna get down ass niggas
All rap about it but you ain’t bout that, nigga's you bomedy out the hood old blawn ass nigga
Ghost town blood and my red rag hanging, fuck rap shit nigga
Fuck what you was saying
Fuck you and anybody who associated with you, from your hood to your kids on the set, I ain’t playing
See me from the shutters if you bitch niggas think you can whoop Iso
Got this local nigga saving up, promoters like "Please don’t bug Iso"

[Chorus]
