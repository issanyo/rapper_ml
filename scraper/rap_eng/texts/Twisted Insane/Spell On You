[Intro: Twisted Insane]
I don't care if you want me, I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you
(You will be mine for ever, and ever)
I put a spell on you
(You will be mine for ever, and ever)

[Hook: Twisted Insane and Redro Killson x2]
Dungeons and dragons and wicked black magic
And shit you will tell in the dark
I put a spell, a spell on you

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Nobody wanna hang around me cause i be doing the voodoo
When they think im fuckin different
Taking them to the chair, grabbin a piece of hair
Little chicks that fuck in an instance

I don't care if you want me, I put a spell on you

So I'm doing it by a spell
Whenever the time is right, get ready to get your brain fucked, bitch
Go ahead, try to scream, nobody's gonna hear your ass for miles and shit
Sticking a needle in a voodoo doll will make you bleed from across the room
Messing around with me and you're gonna meet your fucking doom, dumb bitch
I put a spell on you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Nobody ever leaves me, it won't be that easy, im going to make you fuckin pay the price
Take a knife, poke you on your pretty pussy, really on I'ma take your life
Shit, it ain't no tellin' how many other niggas ran up in your clown and in your room
Messing around with me and you're gonna meet your fucking doom, dumb bitch
I put a spell on you

[Hook]

[Outro: Ritchie Valens]
You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity
