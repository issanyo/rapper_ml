[Intro]
Hold up here he come nigga
Bitch ass nigga!
Help me drag him to the whip
Psh, heavy ass muthafucka
Alright help me lift him in the trunk
Bitch ass nigga!
Come on
Let's ride

[Verse 1]
Drunked up behind the wheel, fuck
Rising up in the night time on an ill one
Remind me to turn a blind eye like a real one
Do or die hit 'em by a mile high with a steel gun
The night has begun
No it ain't a re-run, this shit live when I'm in the building you get high with the sickness
In the cut I roll it up and take another hit before I get vicious
The monster in the dark unleashing demons and they coming to me with the witches
Leaving no witness
Blaze spliff with the Brainsick after dark
Shootin' shit up out the water bottle when I put a hollow in your car
Fo' fifth hocus pocus [lil baby Lar?]
Walk up with the pow pow give a shoutout to Bizarre
Sick when I'm with the mask on like Michael
Walk in full of hate, Norman Bates type psycho
Come out in the night, time better get your rifle
Spin around ten times and you let it off when I pull the blindfold
When I'm up in Colorado [wait up hold on where'd you find?] me with the weed
Hit the homie baby Louis pull up in the foreign roll up on the beat
He told me that he got some info on the where abouts of all the enemies
So I pull up on him with the heater hanging out the window talking 'bout "you remember me?"
To keep it all the way G, I done did it ever since I had a pager
Middle in the night I come into your house looking for fucking paper
Anything to pursue some money, even taking DVD players
And I ain't going home until a nigga hit up another hundred capers
I'm a god, nigga that's that Manson
Mob, but I got a time for your ransom
Nine better be fine are they dancing
Nigga like Suge Night got no time for your dancing
Murder 'em them is a fashion
Grew up and I really never had trust
Plus I will really come into your home invading your space
Any minute they gon' find that they up in a dark room with the fiend
Time to run away from the demon then I put somebody's skin on my face
Ed Gein

[Bridge]
Nature of man to do the things he did to that person
In plain sight scattered throughout the house was a ghastly array of human remains
It's so macabre, so bizarre, so deviant, that we can't look away
His name was Ed Gein

[Hook]
Nigga this that
Ed Gein on Halloween, I'm Brainsick
I murder everybody on the microphone and murder everybody in real life
Nigga this that
Ed Gein on Halloween, I'm Brainsick
I murder everybody on the microphone and murder everybody in real life
Nigga this that
Ed Gein on Halloween, I'm Brainsick
I murder everybody on the microphone and murder everybody in real life
Nigga this that
Ed Gein on Halloween, I'm Brainsick
I murder everybody on the microphone and murder everybody in real life

[Verse 2]
Ed Gein on Halloween I'm Brainsick
They be woofin' on the phone, but everytime I meet 'em they don't even say shit
Knowing every single word'll get up on my nerves, and I be giving face lifts
Make an incision off a wrong decision now you walkin' 'round this buildin faceless
Take this, bullet to the [monkey?] head, I hit 'em with the badabing
How the fuck you want my trust when I don't trust the mother fuckers on my team
Darkness finna come any minute [then you get hit with the B?]
Stick a nigga make it sicker maybe it's the Brainsick in me
You one of the only ones, fuck that, you ain't the only one with a loaded gun
Wouldn't trust you with my life, always had you in my sight even when I'm rollin' one
Raised up at the Jurassic Park with the T-Rex, you ain't knowin' one
Give a nigga couple bitches, took him out the ditches couldn't even say I owe you one
But that's a different [conflict?], niggas get all big headed
I beat the shit up out a perpetrator [boring?] nigga fuck a diss record
You the type of nigga that'll run away and then cry to the detective
And I'm the one to be cramped up in a hotel just suspected
Bodies hangin' in the corner with the marijuana, yes I am a fiend
Put a person to their death, I cut 'em with incision, bitch I'm Edward Gein
[Bring a person to the lab and then I finna take a bite from out your?] spleen
And doin' all the wicked type of shit that you muthafuckas only have dreamed
I mean, cut 'em up make a wallpaper with your titties
Don't trip if I'm all out we can go out get plenty
Hang out with brains out with the bang bang no chiddy
Then walk up on him in the broad day in a hallway with the 50
Get me, but I hot [fo' fo'?] trippy, when I shot through your dickies, but I'm not photo shitty, But I'm not so so iffy
But you run around with your chest out on super thug
Like them niggas would be like fuck that, so what I been shot before
Turn your leg into a lamp; I'm on Ralphy Shit
Hoe lookin' like an alien type tramp; Alfy bitch
Beat off, cut your feet off for fun
And trust you don't really want none with the one
Ed Gein

[Hook]

Ed Gein on Halloween, I'm Brainsick
I murder everybody on the microphone and murder everybody in real life

[Outro]
Investigators were completely stunned and appalled to discover this incredible collection of human body objects. Uh, and among the things they found were bowls that had been made from the tops of human skulls
And then they found what looked like trinkets, but it was like a string of nipples from breasts, all on a string
They found a shade pole that was made from a set of of women's lips
And they had found other body parts there. Then you'd go out into what would be like a living room and they found furniture
A lamp shade that was made out of human skin, a chairs that we upholstered in human skin
They found face masks, Gein had apparently flayed the skin from the heads of victims and preserve them and stuffed them with paper and hung them on the wall as decorations
Hanging from the rafters, upside down, with her head off and gutted like a deer
His name was Ed Gein
