[Intro: Twisted Insane]
Yeah
It's about that time nigga
Mmhmm
Give me my weed [bitch?]
Give me my strap
West Craven, you did this nigga?
This heat uh
I like that shit homie, that's heat
Check it out...

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
I bet you never knew you fuckin with a psycho bitch
Hit em wit venom and rip a nigga at his jaw
Hit em wit venom and sock a nigga in his jaw 'for the nigga even knew what the fuck he saw
I bet you thought I was perverted...
Because I dig up in the booty and I made the pussy leak
I never thought the ho squirted...
Until I licked up in the pussy and they thinkin bout me
Creep with a motherfucka wanna be villian, up in the liquor store to get a 40 bottle of the SHIYAT!
Niggas wanna trip, is when I pop open the clip and leave a motherfucker reloadin and ownin this shit
Mmmm...
I donâ€™t give a fuck about the shoot em up show or the knife show
Im a killa fo' realla, I eat a motha Godzilla but Imma eat a nigga brains like a psycho
Bitch I'm like no
Nigga that you ever did seen
The pussy this red erotic on the team
But you never lookin at me like a nigga was me
You never thought that you would meet a brainsick fiend
Shit up in the bitch's mouth and then i get a blunt
Because I dont wanna smoke on contact
When I got up in the house, I had my balls in her mouth like [please don't choke, use a [?]]
You could be my comrad...
And we could do it everyday until the middle of the Summer when the shit gets deep
And the shit gets deep...
When I really be up on the creep, shit gets deep when the pussy leak [aahh]
In between the sheets...
I would stick it up in the hole until the bitch was psycho
And tried to use her teeth...
On my dick, so I hit a switch and got that rifle
[?]
Stuck it in her butt, then blow booty chunks all over the wall, I admit that I was drunk, but goddamn couldn't get rid of the funk
So I had to get up out that motherfucker, run across the street to McDonalds where I grabbed me a double cheese
Cause I only had a boodle in my pocket and the bitch behind the counter had a pair of some double D's
Now bitch you can smother these...
When I get up in the booty in the middle of the late night hour
And I dig up in the pussy til I get so sweaty that I just have to get in the shower
And I devour...
Til the pussy goes sour
I show em I got the power and nobody cower
With the heat on my waist, Bullets at your face, you will get showered

[Chorus: Twisted Insane]
[The Dookie Monster]
Here he comes creeping through the dark with [heat?]
Here he comes creeping through the dark with [heat?]
Here he comes creeping through the daark...
Here he comes creeping through the daaaark...
[The Dookie Monster]
Here he comes creeping through the dark with [heat?]
Through the dark with...
Here he comes creeping throught the dark with...
Here he comes creeping through the dark with [heat?]
[The Dookie Monster]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
[Pissin?] the blood from out the nigga dick, a motherfucker trippin [let's see this chick gon' get?]

And find a nigga naked when I'm rubbin on those tits
And ever-y-body wanna be known for the brainsick
Hit em on the realla, when I [empty on?] the clip
Two for the brain, [the rest of em?] [?]

Nobody can run away [?] sick
