[Verse 1: C. Ray]
Pull the plug on 'em when the super start to kick in
And my shirt'll get to ripping got me feeling like I'm Bane
And I'm looking for a victim and I sure know how to pick 'em
Watch I run up on the weight to see how quick they get the fade
You can bet I rep a set but I don't gangbang homie
On the bench the only time I let my chains hang homie
I don't even bodybuild but got the same gains on me
While you tweaking with a needle at the same frame phony
So how is it I'm coming with the gains? Genetically
See them 45 pound plates? They enemy
I don't need no juice there ain't no lying in my recipe
A calisthenic killer pumping iron in my pedigree
Look at the intensity you thinking I'mma cut you
When you see me mean muggin and screaming at the muscle
I be on my sixty but you bet that I come in that I am on some power damage you ain't seen a harder hustle
Power level ten thousand, only way to put a stop to my anger
So I'm always in the gym to keep myself alive, ain't I
Looking like I came up out the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
Doesn't matter what my max is
I'm just tryna be ready when they run up
Yeah you said you going to the gym but if you ain't goin hard where in the fuck is you goin' nigga shut up

[Pre-Hook: C. Ray]
Pre-workout kicking in
Stackin on a couple more plates
In the gym I ain't got no friends
I'm here to win homie fuck these weights
Every time you think that I be done
I be throwin up a couple more reps
They find it crazy 'cause I think the pain is fun
They know that I'mma walk in here and kill my sets

[Hook x3: C. Ray]
Go hard or go home
Hard or go home [x3]

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Gym rat when the pre-workout kick in
I'mma get into the zone pushin to the muthafuckin max no pussy
Creatine with a blend a bottle full of protein
Do a couple rows for the hoes like Chris Jones I don't need trainers to push me
Tricep extensions overhead press one more rep
When I turn around and run up out the gym? blood fuck that one more set
Gotta go hard every single time I be up in these bitches they be so wet
Got gains that gonna make by enemies bitch I'm gon get
Swole, let a nigga know, add more plates, bro
Big girls need love too and you never know when they run up for that tussle
Every day up in the weight room, try to press three or four sets, off to the next
Tryna get a muthafuckin chest like Kali Muscle
Squat rack overtrain shit I got this, gotta shock the muscle drop sets
Clear my set so the combination is deadly
I'mma sit up on the bench and never leavin', try'na get a break and hold on, wait a second I'mma get a break and let me put the weight up on 'em, run off in the medley
