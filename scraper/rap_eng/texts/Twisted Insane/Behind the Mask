Laying down sitting on the couch all [?]

[Twisted Insane]
As I travel the globe
People come to my shows
And they want to know
What's behind the mask

[Fans]
Is that twisted insane?
Oh my god it is
I think he's the best, and he raps so fast
I don't know how he do it
Man I heard he ain't human
I heard he's a ghost
I heard he's a demon
I heard he's a monster
Ain't from this world

What's behind the mask?


Brain
The mask, the mask, the mask
My war paint designed to strike fear and reveal the monster inside
A representation of the demon within
A visual to my soul
A symbol of my presence
When I enter this mask, I enter my realm
I see the world as is and as is the world sees me
[something backwards, will check later]
Ha Ha Ha Ha


[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
I can already hear you talking twisted is the wicked so we talking about the heat or he be rapping too fast
I be reading every comment on my facebook and youtube and even on my twitter when they wolfing that trash
And its behind the mask always talking in subliminals
But tell me why the police want to label me a criminal
Under estimate me I'm a motherfucking general
I'll pull a razor blade and get to chopping off your genitals
And I could be drunk driving up outta crash man
Foot up on the pedal as I put ya in the gas tank
Filled it with the octane
Take a moment to be silent for the people dyin living life up in the fast lane
I'm Jason and Freddy mixed with a little Eddie -
Scissorhands and chopping people up into confetti
Left them laying in the street chest looking like spaghetti
I be standing on the corner if you want me come and get me
It's like Amityville but on the real sometimes I feel like I'm a demon
Doesn't matter who I do believe in
I used to be afraid when it was dark
Now I sit without the candle burnin posted with my forty and my weed in
I bet you feeling real safe when you talk shit from your keyboard in your home, quiet as a mouse
Don't know who you was fucking with
I could be the one to get a fully loaded gun and get to breaking in your house
Told your people I'm the wrong
One to bring the funk into
Niggas think it's music but I really bring the heat
Chewin through your face, murder was the case
See the demons all around me every time a nigga try to speak
Thought about chopping off the feet there will be no running
When I cut you up I'll put you in a room full of pain
I'm getting sick and tired of all the people on the internet
That's wolfing up but they don't really want to see insane

[hook: Twisted Insane]
They ain't phasing my sick (x8) (says nigga after 3rd & 7th)

Real pain, redrum (x4)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
They tell me I'm a devil because the way I spit it
Tell me gets em reminiscing to a kind of wicked genius
You find out what's behind the mask you're running from it
Why don't you erase the dark and tell me what you want and if you need it
Hopin this enough to win them over but they feeling me
The fact that you continue with this crap it often killing me
I never change my content
If you bangin bring your niece and told me
Please you stupid bitch cuz that would jeopardize the enemy
You'll never get the realer me
Niggas run up and get knocked out then I put the shit on Instagram
Nigga better back up he can act tough
He was fruity as the motherfucka Toucan Sam
Nigga that was sega genesis
They don't want to see behind the mask because they be look into the eyes of horror death
So mytholical and diabolical I'll rearrange your itty-bitty brain and put my symbol on your chest
Turnin your room into a mess
Pissin on your dress and while you get your blessin not to mention on the bloody walls
Fuck your negativity if you ain't got no Righteous shit to say about a niggas shit donâ€™t say that shit at all
I be looking at the feed
Smoking on my weed
Take a hit and get to trippin while you motherfuckers wolf
If I hear somebody say I might to get to thinking that i mustve fucked his bitch at a show and she hooked
When it come to pimpin' I'mma play it by the book
Walk behind a nigga yous the shadow of a pimp
And everything you hoes
Ever done
To me we young
Number one
Reason i have hate for a bitch
Skip to my lou and kick rocks when you dip
Fuck 'em and I cut 'em bitch you already know
Pick your poison and bring your boys in this motherfucker so they can come and carry the body out the door
