[Intro Skit: Dikulz & Twisted Insane]

[Verse 1: Dikulz]
I open the door
Body's all sore, we been going through war
We can't take no more, then we see the decor
And notice blood soaked floors, think we been here before
Then the door slams shut and it locks, fuck
Twisted, not again, I think we've gotten stuck
Just then a shadow emerges, I'm feelin' baffled and nervous
I pull the [?] then have shots buck
But it don't do nothin'
Passes right through it, it just laughs and it disappears
I look at Twisted, "Ay, Twisted, listen, we gotta find a way to get up out of here"
So we split and we get down the hallway
Man, I fucked around and I must have went the wrong way
'Cause when I look right behind us, a wall just divide us
At the end of the hall, I see a long face
Screams and it starts chasin'
I freeze, I'm in awe like I'm stargazin'
Then I dip to the kitchen, I'm try'na get out its vision
I'm try'na keep it quiet, can't, 'cause my heart's racin' (Shh)
I can't be found
Huh, what the fuck was that sound
Fuck that, now I'm doublin' back
I try to hustle, but it come and attack
And then it flung me to the ground
Then it grabs me when I try and crawl
Damn, I'm all pinned against the wall
Lookin' at his face, shit was all dissolved
Look like Sammy Sosa, I'm sick and I'm appalled
Then I fall to my knees and I try to just plead with it, please, please, please
But it's not [?] it leaves, it just squeezes the soul from my chest
Now I know I'm possessed

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane & Dikulz]
Step back, I'm 'bout kick the do' in
I can't believe we came in here, I thought you was jokin'
I'm try'na get the bitch open, I really am hopin'
Before we end up in the back all hangin' by ropes and
Hold up, hold up, niggas, what the fuck is some [weird folk ?]
And then I heard somebody sayin', "What is you here fo'"
I turn around and see somebody comin' I got to runnin'
I need to find a gun before they cut off my earlobe
[I hit the left and the right head ?] and waited
Thinkin' it's just a matter, my time's been deflated
Dikulz, I'm comin' to get you so walkin' through the kitchen
I grab a knife off of dishes, know I am serrated (Get me out)
I'm tryin' hard as I can, fam
Try'na keep it quiet and all I'm hearin' is bam bam
Is anything around (Let me see)
That can help like some shit on the shelf, or maybe keys to a Grand Am
Huh, I gotta see what's up
Keep lookin', though (For what?)
How am I 'posed to know what you lookin' fo'
Twisted, let me out now
Man, you soundin' kinda different, homie, if you wasn't family, I would buck and go
Holy [?]
Blood, you kicked the door off of the hinge (Run)
Wait, hold up
Why you comin' at me, lookin' funny, what the fuck is wrong with your grin
Are you off your wits?
Man, you really lookin' like you kinda lost your shit
Leavin' up out of the window with your fuckin' [?] to split
If you didn't find the keys, then I'mma [hot ?] the whip (Shit)
I can't believe we made a mess
A demon got a hold of you and he gon' take what's best
If I put the knife up in you, he'd be laid to rest
The only way that I could save you is a blade to chest
