[Hook: Chris Ray]
I get's my dough my dough I get my money money
I get's my, I said I get's my dough my dough I get's my money money I get's my
I said I get's my dough (I stack it up)
My dough (I stack it up) I get my money money (I stack it up)
I get my, I said I get's my dough (I stack it up)
My dough (I stack it up) I get my money money (I stack it up)
I said I get to my money

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Outside the club looking way too clean
Fifty on my wrist, two hundred on my feet
Liquid assets fashion got me feeling myself from the time
I wake up in the morning till the time I go to sleep
Fresh chinchilla with the installed heat
I'm already well done and you raw meat
Cause any minute I might get with it become a villain and start
Busting up in the courtroom like I'm Kwali
With a feeling for the beat in my two toned seats
Anybody want it they can come my way
He could be three-hundred and fifty pounds
From the ground up, a hound that's not even half my weight
Hopping out a new Lamborghini they wanna be me cause they all in bikinis
Sipping on apple martinis bumping the system provided by twisted insane
Hit em get em lit em up looking like a reappearing Houdini
They gone hate you for this one
I know I don't give a um
They gone have to face it I'm really amazing so
Keep on hating my blood is racing but my feet is numb
Tell me do you really wanna go one on one with the
One that's having the fun and making my money by the ton
Haven't you learned your lesson I'm guessing I'd be the best
And I'm testing my opponent strength 100 to the 1
Feeling like I'm bigger than godzilla on the rilla
From the shoes on my feet to the sheets on my pillow
And you got to admit I'm sicker than I'm salmonella
With the heat no goatee for gorilla
Move through the dark shining bright
Cause I'm unlike anybody that you could ever know
It don't take a genius for you to figure out
I'm letting everybody know, I get dough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Put it on my tab I ain't worried for this coffin
Sitting and I'm flipping through the brand new flossin'
Happily favored by the undefeated when I'm tossin
Money around because you know it's nothing to a boss when
Ya making money by the ton
The twenties and the tens and the fives and the 1s
We spend em in the fifty dollar bill and one hun
We toss em in the safe that's how fast they come
Everything up on me you could tell it's brand new
A crispy white T
And some pearly white shoes
If you really wanna run up and you think you too cool
Anybody that wanna go up against me will lose
And I don't really give a
You don't really give a
We don't really give a
Here we go again I'm spending cheese
Tipping on my henn and I ain't even bought the Benz
But I'll be having all the woman on bended knee
Well I could only catch you looking at the scenery
Visons when I get em popping off the greenery
I can still remember when they all was mean to me
Now it seem like every girl just wanna be wit me
Everybody running man they really wanna bump it
Put it all up in ya stomach cause I get em when they coming
People always jumping when they hear the music strumming
Cause it really gets you pumping so make one for the running
Got a lot of money falling all up in my jeans
Spit em get em addicted they falling into fiends
Feet on red meat and lima beans and I don't leave the table till I eat all my greens
Move through the dark shining bright cause I'm unlike anybody that you could ever know
It don't take a genius for you to figure out, I'm letting everybody know, I get dough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Hold up(x3)
The money is stacking and if I lit a dollar you could probably see it for miles
Know what(x3)
I'm running over my competition
But I will diss em like olympic trials
Switches on the hip, to the drop from the stones on my watch it's much more than time
Come with me while I rise to the top double fisted on the yacht with nothing but dimes
Making money just because the way I rhyme
Bar for bar and pound for pound, I'm king
I am the ruler of my time the invisible line that separates you from me
Sick from the get go get
Running from a newer dollar you ain't saying nothing
I think a wise man once said got go got mo hot hose making money cause it
I said I get to my money!
