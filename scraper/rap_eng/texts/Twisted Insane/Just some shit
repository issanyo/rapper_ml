Hey, when the album coming out nigga?

...Soon

I like to drink, slurp
Laying in my throw-up
Couple minutes gotta go up
And all the fans done showed up

These other rappers are so what x 2
Obviously yes, obviously it don't take talent just to blow up

I'm like drank, and I ain't gonna rap about bitches all in my whip, nope
And I ain't gonna rap about condos all in my wrist

I just drank, slurp
Laying in my throw-up
Couple minutes gotta go up
And all these fans done showed up

Now how the fuck do I walk out on these fans in my shows when a nigga ain't on TV
Because I love to interact with her remember one time they could feel me like I was in three deep

I'm at the bar and I'm ready for shit to stop
I don't wanna hear motherfuckers saying I can't hang
I like to drink, what you smoking dank? What, you in the parking lot?
Even when in the frozen rink

Stepping in the venue, I can barely fucking walk
I know I gotta rap, but I can barely fucking talk
Give me five minutes, I walk up in the bathroom
I'm pissing like a horse, but I can barely fucking stop

Done, now I gotta get up on the stage
Feeling like my motherfucking ass is over
Don't hang with this nigga, dangerous nigga
Really kinda faded, but I'm feelin' sober

[switch]

Bending bitches over
I'm from Minnesota, where the shit is really colder
But I really gotta phone her
My position when I told her, that it's bigger than a boner

I really wanna get a boner, so I hit her with the boner
Paying no attention, took a hit with this suspicion
Then I'm ripping everything when I get up in the walls

Niagara nigga, that's how I felt when I felt that pussy melt
Hop on a niggas balls

Rain, pouring
All these rappers is boring
I'm asleep to the morning
Wake me up if I'm snoring

[switch]

Wake up
Nigga you asleep, shit is weak in the game
You say shot 'em in the face cause just they listen to Twisted Insane
You walk in the spot, fronting, so I'm roasting this bitch
I told them to pick their poison, they overdosing and shit

Well shit, don't they know this twisted insane shit go realest?
Gonna have niggas on shooting sprees like Tony Montana
I'm about as hard as they come with this music shit
You can ask my niggas around me if I really do this shit

Brainsick

[switch]

OE
8-Ball
Ask them niggas if I drink that 8-ball
But I drink so much you think I'm drinking piss
Pull up with the homies, now you shitting bricks

Oh no
Not me
I'm socking niggas up like I was Rocky
I can be by myself and a nigga still like fuck 'em all
They can jump me today but tomorrow I fuck 'em all

Take a nigga life with the four fifth
Hop up in the whip, then hit that corner
(Brain)

Running red lights get away clean, looking for a nigga
I'll weave that corner (Brain Brain Brain Brain)

OE, I need some fuckin more
And I won't stop until I'm laying on the fucking floor

[switch]

They always tell me that you drink too much Twisted
And you need to slow up or else one day weâ€™ll all be up at your funeral Twisted
Maybe you don't give a fuck and you living your life how you want to do, Twisted
Maybe I'm tripping the day where I keep making music and people don't listen

I'm sitting alone in my room
Flipping away through cartoons
I can remember when I was rapping on the stage
And I was too fucked up on shrooms
