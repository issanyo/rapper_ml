[Intro: Reporter #1]
?
Went down and cut up the body and then they took part of the body and they put it in a ravine area underneath some branches
They took the head and the arms in a trash bag, threw it in the trunk of their car, stopped at the McDonald's drive thru because..of course..they were very hungry after all this..and then went to Black Hawk State Park and dumped it in the man hole

[Intro: Reporter #2]
After they did all this..right? After they killed this girl,after they tried to burn her body, after they cut her up, dismembered her, they smoked some weed then they went to went right to McDonald's and they ate

[Verse 1: Trizz]
Swervin' and parkin'
We all on the street
Twisted Insane in the passenger seat
He told me I'm good when I come, that's deep
I show him the same, if he come that's b
Niggas got beef so we packin' some heat
Niggas is deep so we packin' the jeep
Who actually G
'Cause we bout to see
Who really get active who down to go creep
Fuckin with me and you'll probably lose sleep
Havin nightmares about me like Freddy and weep
Niggas got money but talkin' is cheap
You pay for protection, like bitches you weak
I go to a block and get love 'cause I'm me
You kissin' they ass 'cause you scared to get beat
I'm solo, I'm dolo 'n' hella discreet
Cross me like Jesus, get wrapped in the sheet
Pull up to functions, don't show my ID
Just walk up like fuck it, they let me in free
Bitches be on us, they buyin' us drinks
They fuck with this G shit, they love how we speak
We take 'em on missions, you take 'em to eat
She holdin' my knife in her purse with the weed
We argue a lot but shit, that's what I need
Fuckin we fuck 'til she weak at the knees
Bitch I don't party, I'm posted with G's
Smokin' on tree, drinkin' on E's
R.I.P Caddy, my nigga OD 'cause he was that dope and was servin' emcees
Wanted for weed, we family indeed
Call that the heartshed and black when I bleed
Eyes bloodshot like I'm freebasin' speed
The devil be callin',  I pick up and leave

[Hook (x2)]
These niggas be trippin', they comin' to get it
We bout to get active
It really can happen, It can get crackin'
Pull up and hop out with action
It can get tragic, wrapped up in plastic
Ashes to ashes
Put that bitch in a casket
This is my passion
I'm workin' this magic

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Night time
Fixin' to write rhymes for the end tho
