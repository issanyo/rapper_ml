I kill, I kill
(I just want these motherfuckers to feel me on some shit..As I sit alone in my dark room, all alone in my dark room)

[Verse 1]
I be livin' on the dark side, come take a trip into the brain of wicked
I be havin' 'em burnin' and put 'em up in the kitchen
And quit your bitchin' and flippin, don't get offended with it
My premonition always comes into existence, paranoid since I had my forevision
Llluminated like I'm walking on water,
I could've been the one that's been walking in your mansion with a hatchet
Slaughter every single woman, even off in your daughter
Nobody's runnin' from the devastation
I'm too mothafuckin' evil to tell me that I'ma kill off a demons
I never really listen to it
Anybody said I never take it to the head, but now my nigga I kinda believe 'em
And I can feel it within me, it's like talkin'; telling me to murder every single person right in front of me
Yo I don't really know I should even be listening
To this nigga, ?? the one to smoke a blunt with me
Fuck it maybe a nigga trippin'
I'm waking up off of liquor, and maybe it was the shrooms, maybe it was the tombs
Hate my overreaction I'm sweating like I was fighting a muthafuckin' baboon
I never really said it but
"Ainâ€™t no other rapper really fuckin' with me, I be choppin niggas into dust"
They be workin on the speed but they ain't really caught up to my delivery I don't wanna hear you niggas fuss
I walk up in the bar and everybody is crazy
Give me the whole bottle but I don't want to fuckin chase it
Ways to get wasted, take it up to the face and drink it like a pussy and sit back and taste it
Niggas'll need Lasik, to see what the fuck I say, when you look into my mother fucking eyes at night
When you talkin' bout the brains you better be careful about what the fuck you talk cause you can die on sight
I kill

[Hook]
Run up and I kill, run up and I kill, run up and I kill, nigga
??
The rap assassin motherfucker with the razorblades
I remain the great, rockin your brains and face, and you never really knowin if today's the day
Cause i kill [x2]

[Verse 2]
Kill anybody that on the flow
Told you bout the Devil what you runnin' for
I put a bitch right up on her bed and she wanna ho
Your divin' in the pussy yellin' ho Geronimo
Beer drinker, weed smoker
Finna' get myself into some ign'ant shit
These mother fuckers prayin' for they life up on their knees i never really got into that whole religious shit
I'm finna' take em to church,only its gonna be worth it cause i was there choppin' bodies up in a hearse
I shred em all into ashes for anybody attackin' incredible hulk is smashin' i put em up in the dirt
And everybody that runnin' they will all get hurt
Everybody runnin' from the brains to the, hold up
Nigga's get there face split up
I pulled the heat to his noggin until that mother fucker gave it up
Every single day i blaze it up
I ain't no mother fuckin' hype or nothin' nigga but i need my weed
I smoke trees indeed, and get to smokin' out a mother fuckin' bong
Tommy Chong and a swisher sweet
Ever seen a murder in the 5th degree?
Lyrically choppin' their bodies up into pieces
Eatin' every single one of em like they was Reese's i put em up in the ground and cover the face with feces
Yea, fuck your life, fuck the world i had a wicked year
I made a deal with the devil he told me that it was settled when every nigga was dead but (i'm still here)
Nigga, its so official
Its already there but put your lips on the whistle
I told you that a nigga really doesn't fuck with the system but i'm movin' over mother fuckers like i was a missile right here

[Hook]
Run up and I kill, run up and I kill, run up and I kill, nigga
??
The rap assassin motherfucker with the razorblades
I remain the great, rockin your brains and face, and you never really knowin if today's the day
Cause i kill [x2]
