(Yo turn my headphones up a little bit? Aight, Aight)

[Verse 1: Jordan Royale]
(It's) It's my time
This is my grind
And I'll meet y'all fucks at the finish line
I'm remarkable and y'all are just fine
It's my time to shine in due time
I incline while y'all decline
Brought a whole new meaning to rock rap while y'all sit back and sniff a coke line
I don't care and I don't mind
You can stay underground
I'll be signed
You can be reminded
You can reminisce
I'm up on a planet like Genesis
I told ya bitch, I'm your nemesis
In the rap game driving 105
Times like this that I feel alive
Ride or die and I'll still survive
(Still survive, still survive)
(Stick) Stick to your cruise control
Make you go crazy and lose control
You're crap underneath my shoe sole
You're shit at the bottom of the toilet bowl
I'm on top of the motherfucking totem pole
Thought I already fucking told ya so?
(Power, power, power, power)
You're lyrical game ain't nothing
You see me better be running
My style and my tongue are cunning
And emcees is what I been hunting
Don't try to even be stunting
Broke rappers is fronting
Y'all look like you're on something
I'm on a whole lot of vodka and nothing

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
I'm brain [?] that you're friends with me
And don't nobody wanna see me it's catastrophe
I got these bitches only here to [?] sucking my dick
And I ain't never really leaving 'til my masterpiece
You make a move, I make a movie
You can keep me like a checker
Triple decker, homie ain't nobody fucking with me really
And normally I be up on the cool
But if anybody come and disrespectful I'm a slap a nigga silly
I ain't selling for a milli
I don't care about the industry
As long as when I die a couple people do remember me
How could I have gone right before your hating song
[?] music last past a century
Microphones I kill em and I eat em up
Try to get you to go but you pussy whipped
Try to cool me down but I'm a eat em up
I'm a pull a jedi knife full [?]  the ignorance
Drunk driving, weed smoking
Hot box the whip when I'm on the move
[?] Pull the windows down, and buckle up and shut up and try to keep it cool
They pull me over if they wanna I'm a basket case
So they can drink it with a wish and go to fucking hell
Murder you and put you all up in the basement
Like I was Jason
I really can't stand that fucking smell, I got

[Verse 3: Jordan Royale]
(I'm) I'm tired of y'all saying I got this
And I'm tired of y'all saying I got that
It's time to bring the real music back
Can't understand you on the track
Maybe it's 'cause you're real whack
(Fuck) Fuck you eat my ballsack
And I'm 'bout to teabag on this track
'Cause real lyrics is what you lack
It's time to make my comeback
I'm that drug that you call crack
Stop saying you in the studio
What the fuck you mean? You doing blow
And I may be a little cold though
And I don't care what you think so
What the fuck you mean you going in?
What the fuck you mean you going out?
I give all my homies a shout out
But that's a lie 'cause I don't go out
I sit at home and drink my face off
And write lyrics while I jerk off
You're a fake wall I rip the paint off
You're fake cold with a fake cough
You're a fake heart with a fake soul
Wait what the fuck you mean bro?
(Bro, bro) Bro what the fuck you think that means
(Woo)
I told you once I own the scene
I shit success while you shit beans
You out there feeding fucking fiends
I work my ass off to make ends meet
Don't care if you out there on the street
You're shit ass music can take a seat
All you rappers out there are beat street
Eat the grass off my sneaker cleat
You thought hell was hot and I bring the heat
Pete and repeat were on a boat
And then Pete fell off I said who was left
Yeah repeat (repeat)
Repeat (repeat) Repeat (repeat)
Get it? (Get it)
(Haha)
Now fucking repeat
