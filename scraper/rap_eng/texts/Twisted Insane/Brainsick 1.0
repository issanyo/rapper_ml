[Verse 1: Hurricane]
Label me as murder compatible
I’m a sick individual, that’ll chop you from the land of Oz
Brain sicker then a fuckin' lobotomy on the side of me
I got the tools out the garage
And the machete that’ll make confetti
Of niggas who thinking they ready
I’m deadly like a serpent bowl of spaghetti
When I spit it I do it to them
Leave 'em in a predicament, here they die
Crumble up negaros when they try
I’m a midwest guy
Better yet I’m a the wizard Insane done simmons
You can clearly hear me comin'
Adrenaline steady runnin'
I’m yearning, fiending for something I’m about to get it now
I was overlooked by the snake and the bat
Now I'm fucking with the cat from the Cal
Verbal anomaly, odd psychology
I probably oughta be in a padded room or a straight jacket
I don’t know man, I think I’m
Insane!

[Verse 2: Mr. Dos Muchos]
Anybody tryna be the one to come and get it
Then they better be upset that a ton of us are ready
If we talk about the internet then they could really live it
I don’t wanna be the person that you’re hopin' will give pity
'Cause they’re lookin' at ‘em differently, come across a menace
I’m invincible, pretend to put his hands on trenants
And look what I got all those jumpy niggas as apprentice
And I gotta murder everybody comin’ with a vengeance
One ain’t no sicker that be comin' for the brain
And I ain’t got to tell nobody 'cause he’s the leader of the gang
When they lookin' at him and really wanna be the motherfucker
That’ll put a muzzle in ya body then I track up in you name
Wanna copycat but they don’t understand my ways
And I making more money like my name is Damon Wayans
So don't mess around and be a victim when I’m kill them with the venom, blame it on
Insane!

With- with- with the thoughts you'd be thinking

[Verse 3: Troll]
Trigger like an animal figure my ammunition is quicker
Like I pull on the trigger when I deliver these scriptures
Everybody partyin', get in quiet like a menace zippin' it like I pull an automatic
Hit 'em with an automatic, got 'em runnin’ like a rabbit
I trappage and I chizzle him in Colorado canvas
They call me a savage 'cause I damage anything in the way with the brain and I'ma clan
Brain!

[Verse 4]
One ain’t no sicker that be comin' for the brain
And I ain’t got to tell nobody 'cause he’s the leader of the gang
One ain’t no sicker that be comin' for the brain

And nigga don't give a fuck about a nigga with leprosy

Insane!

[Verse 6: Crucified]
Pull 'em, stuckin' 'em, get 'em all nasty and takin' 'em and puttin' 'em all up like majority
So then bustin' 'em through the hospital
It's like a posse
And so bring 'em around the corner
On the street in which we take 'em and then
Go on 'em and make 'em feel like insane
And so motherfucker they are never confront us
And we get 'em with the powercand with question
How do you feel pushy and don’t give a fuck because of it
And like an evil we smash 'em
And take 'em to the another song
Whenever we hit 'em a front me
After smash 'em we gonna hit 'em with the venom
And wait the moment till my choppers
All will feel and will go like an insane
And we are murdering 'em all like murderers
And venom all 'em and get 'em all blinked motherfucker
I'm fuckin' beast, we are that murdering choppers
And we still get 'em on the flames
This is for sneak and for the venom
As soon as I'm steppin' I get 'em all victimized
What's chopper from us bring 'em
And stick 'em motherfucking majority
And like a leader come and fuck the fucking ego's
It’s time to chase 'em everybody
'Cause it's real hard to fuck that bitches
And make 'em like pitches in the fucking visions
And make 'em all be the scared
I’m that motherfucker that gonna beat 'em
And gonna rip 'em
And hold 'em on their bag
And saying like you are my ham and something shit
Because they are very wicked bitches that might gon die
And I gonna take 'em and kill 'em bitches
And runnin' up in your house
Insane!

[Verse 7: KD the Stranger]
Psiny psevdo
Sovety davali, no bedy minovali, potomu dokonali moral'no
Menya tupo ne ponimali, potomu namereno meshali
Potom pytali, podumayte puli parabelluma byli letal'ny
Tochony navyki po nocham, po nachalu i minovali strany
Eto potomu byli zavisimy ot mikrofona
Naoborot takimi polomali talony
Polovina kotorykh pytalis' potom balabolit'
NE zombirovany massami
Za gramotoy ne laminirovannoy oni pryatali razumy
Slovami zaminirovali vidy srazu
Tebya postepenno dva materika atakovali frazami
No vy bili nogami po polu
Ne slyshali my topota
Tak zavedeno bylo
Insane!

[Verse 8: Charles Xavier]
Hmmm, bitch please, you be layin' in the gravel
When I know about the niggas that I’m bringin' to the batter
I be kickin' on your head and got it shakin' like a rattle
Anybody wanna beef and I'ma murder all the cattle
Skedaddle, get ghost
Quicker than my brain gets when I hit the slopes
We be bittin' mother flame, they deliver the pain
But when I take ‘em with the griller
Then I'ma hit again the do’ with the flow so switch
I fuck ‘em with the lyric and murder, I’m homegrown
I be singin’ like an alien and tell ‘em to phone home
Like I’m about to hop in the ship with the brother
Take a drink over with 'em
And tell 'em how many bitches slain dick
Then I gotta go with the niggas who can’t spit
Every single record that I bring is the same shit
Here’s why you don’t fuck with niggas who Brainsick'n
Insane!

[Verse 9: Z (of Firing Squad)]
I’m a monster in the dark, when I tore up their face
Give it a barely other inevitable, I have to pay
I chop for the brain but heat it like I make music with insane
But we’re equally gassed so I Shoot For The Face, shoot 'em with the A
Show pity when I’m switchin' lanes
And strategically came to the spittin' range, split the thangs
Stop, get choked, the chains
It’s the Firing Squad, that’s who, [?]
Literal when I get on when I gas ‘em with the mask off
Talkin’ about what we said, then I be comin' surely after
I’m mysterious, hate ‘em, let 'em laugh all they augh off
It’s pitiful, I couldn’t boy, none of 'em are [?]
Act when I smack, my brain gonna fuck 'em
On way to my mind, hold on motherfucker
Killer when I’m dealin’ with the villain that is speakin' B.R.A.I.N
Insane!
Brainsick, bitch

[Verse 11: Twisted Insane]
Hit 'em whenever they wanna run up and get a bullet up in they noodles
Choppin' 'em up into pieces, doin' the feces when I'm doin' the voodoo
Thinkin' about my thesis, finna be deep enough in telekinesis
Takin 'em off a leash and put a meat shredder through your fucking poodles
Over the top and people lookin' at me like I'm Godzilla
Comin' up out the ocean with bullets ready to kill 'em
I seek 'em like I'm a pillar I'm lookin' for my division
If you thinkin' that they would suffer then I'mma potato peel 'em
Takin' 'em in the back
And puttin' a sack up over their dome
And tell them "Tell me everything I wanna know or they fucked"
Finally get to talkin' after I told 'em it would stop but when they tell me everything I wanna know they're still fucked
Dumpin' 'em at your bunk
And finna be puttin' your body in 'em
And then they don't wanna see me when I really do my thang
I will cook 'em in the kitchen and eat 'em up with the feast
Muthafucka I'm
Insane!
