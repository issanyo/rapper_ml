[Verse 1]
Nighttime shit, different shit, fuck your couch nigga that ignorant shit
Gibberish shit? come to your house in the night with a bullet delivering shit
I'm sick of this shit, but I always stay ready, so I keep machetes like I was on Jason
Halloween, Edward Gein, Elm Street, Crystal Laking
[ready the roots to go bait him?] I'mma fry everyone like they was bacon
Take 'em, and rape em, then scrap em off the street at night; they think I'm Satan
But I'm really just a motherfucker who likes to get high at night
Cut them and hang 'em up over the bridge then watch them die at night
Murder is a lovely sight, in fact, I love it when the shit is close range
Grab 'em and, stab 'em and run up his face with cocaine
Look, I really hate to be one to brush you off, but a motherfucker really got a problem
I came here from hell, but I don't know where I was going
I just MURDER AND MURDER AND MURDER AND CHOP 'EM
Put em in the pot then cook and pop 'em mix ready like I was on Dahmer shit
24/7 I'm effed the fuck up, but they all want me on some calmer shit
The wickedest witch, and I am not talking about Harry Potter
Walking death, nighttime, moonlight, scary slaughter

[Hook]

Night stick
I will get
Deep in you brain with the ice-a-pick
Mind if it, split your wrist
Excuse me if [Imma slur I'm-a-blitzed]
One in your chest, One in your brain
Won't be catch you disrespecting my name
For people that's acting too funny, I'm going up over the hill with the [caine?]
Or I'm the..
X2

[Verse 2]
"Mayday, mayday, somebody is in here stabbing my husband"
That's what she said 'fore I cut off his head then I listened to her tell me how much she loved him
Told her pick up his head hold it straight just so I could take pictures of him
Niggas be rapping and singing the same shit over and over because they have no substance
Fill em up [with death on the tape?][could have been bigger better come from the dungeon?]
Nightmares, rigor mortis, dark days, body crunching
Circumstances, certain situations have me on one
With the long gun ready to bust from the hip 'till they all done
Take 'em right up out the game every time a nigga pull up, and I'm bustin' with the pistol
I was only wondering about some kind of issue, now a nigga walking with a bullet in his tissue
Yeah, aight put him in the trunk with the rest of these niggas that's wolfin'
Tattle-tales, fucking rats, dirty snitches all get took and
Give them tons of ass-whoppins, look at how all them niggas are shooken
It made my fucking day to see them niggas all ready to get up and start booking
The Wickedest witch in the west, and I am not talking about Harry Potter
The phenom, the [hemon?], the demon, scary slaughter

[Hook]X1

[Bridge]

I'm off that shit and I just can't explain
The way that I just split her brain
That scary slaughter
I've been ripping her face with this dull razorblade
Fill her wounds with cocaine
It's that slaughter

[Verse 3 Redro Kill]

I'm patiently watching you die slow
[Im mom in?] mixed with the hydro
I've been advised to eat you alive oh
Eating your face has been my goal
Sick in the brain since I've been alive
I want you to die so me and this knife
Will paint a picture with your blood tonight
Brainsick, squad up, they don't wanna let us all bust
They be [knowing?] we can spit shit
So she gon' have ta let us all fuck that
Scary Slaughter
Name [izervene mishguts?] [Wiggle with a hard dick?] so this dead bitch finna get fuck that
Scary Slaughter
She's bleedin', and screamin', I'm searching for reasons
To keep her I need her to love her, but fuck it I rather just [sin and Jesus is at?]
