Hook x4
Slide through the dark off a night time shit with a clean 4-5th and your wrist I split up

Verse 1 (Twisted Insane)
Slide through the dark off a night time shit with a clean 4-5th and your wrist I split up
Brains in my plate and I play with this food 'fore I eat it for the moment I am sick I get up
Knife in 'em and I'm on a mission in the middle of the night when everybody put their babies off to sleep
I be lurkin all up in the mental while they mention me whenever I be takin motherfuckers off their feet
Double it when I be coming and flippin and gonna be poppin at everybody that wanna go up against me
Niggas already tempt me
To put a bullet in your menoodle
Send you to funeral trippin up off a Bentley
Fuck your life! Conversation is minimal
People tellin me that my music is sendin you subliminals
Sick of livin in slums and how you bumpin your gums a motherfucker keep wolfin I'm rippin off niggas' genitals
Better make way when the Reaper come, I told you niggas all the visions that are right around the corner!
He comin for you it don't matter where you from, I was born and raised in San Diego California
With the fully auto with me and I'm off that shit
Put 1 up in you or 2 up in you or 3 up in you or 4 up in you
I'm finna fill you with bullets or how you runnin back to the captain I'm wonderin why them motherfuckers said you a fool with it
Feelin like I was soon hades the frontal poppin the carnival  looking into your soul
Say you looked around the world and couldn't find me...
I was up in the pitcher house smokin upon a bowl
I was up in the murder fest I was up on a roll
Fill em with bullet holes then I gotta get away quick
People they wanna wolf and they gettin put in a hole
Niggas they wanna switch but I'm always keepin it sick
Brainsyck nigga!

Verse 2 (Dikulz)

Slide through the dark off a night time shit with the clean 4-5th and your wrist I split up
Comin to harvest your guts, cuttin the carcasses up
Eat your flesh and the rest I zip-up
Huh, man I'm gettin a feeling
Spitzafrenik, get a medic, gonna be makin a killin
And try to use a lot of blood when they pull through the building
And making you a piñata watch you hang from the ceilin
Now watch... As i beat em and peat em
I cut em and gut em i weed em and clean them
I grade them fillet them i even cazeed em
Im evily creepin I'm leavin em leakin

Be clever remember I'ma smother their brains
Then they wanna fear the sync of the lyrical chain

So back-y the fuck up before I go chunk em cause i got no time to just mess with you twats
Unless you wanna get it, going kamikaze with it I'ma catch your body with it cause you're here to get shot
Dead on the spot cause the artform they losin
Or let them just rot cause we often just rude to em
I'm causing contusions they off in illusion
We constantly bruisin them thats what we do to em
So i just lash at their face and I grab the duct tape and a sign to explain to them I'm simply amazing

Alot of people wonder if i took it too far but i tell em hell naw man this ain't shit
Alot of people told me that i need to go in switch but i tell em hell naw cause i gotta stay sick Brainsick!

And I can warn you about the premeditation
But they still go brainless while the squad go "Brainsick"
