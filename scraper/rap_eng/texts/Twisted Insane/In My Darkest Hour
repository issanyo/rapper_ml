[Intro]
Unknown
Living life day to day walking into a world full of unknowns
Survive, that's all one can try to do

[Verse 1]
The life of a young child, abused, and for days I would lay in the junk pile
Never seen one smile, I used to bomb the beaker on them when I was walking every one mile
There wasn't no lectures
My strap was so jammed, so there was no protection
You must have a death wish
I can't walk away so I stay to protect it
Smokin' weed, chasin' dreams
I walk out the door trynna face my fiends
One day I promise I'll be livin' off of rap shit, that's it
[Now I'm going in so I can't think of things?]
I'm on a mission, listen
I just wanna progress, no stress, blowin' on some cess weed
I was on the front line daily walkin' with the heater just in case some wanna test me trip
Posted with the homies, I ain't dealin' wit' you phonies
I be better off just trippin' off a bottle of the liquor
And every time you come around, you never got no money for no weed and yes indeed you wanna hit up on my swisher
And I don't even like that shit
Who wanna [pull me?] you be quiet than a bitch
I don't even know this nigga, who the fuck you come with?
I don't give a shit I only need my wife and a spliff
One pipe and a hit
Guess I got my trees indeed you would think it's just a hobby, but I need my weed
It was a dream for me making it in the music
Now If I lose it every time I think I need some cheese shit
Shit is hella' crazy, a quarter mile trynna walk me an inch
So I said and I think to myself that I came a long way since I slept up on a bench
Thank you

[Bridge]
And I'm still livin' this life
Watchin' time pass by
As I begin to realise my omnipotence and embrace it
We become more intuitive individuals
Individuals that will not be overpowered or overwhelmed
By anything that stands in our path
That's real

[Verse 2]
Stuck on the fences
No type of rent is due for me since it's
No way I can fix this shit
Take it out on all so who's on my hit list
Who wanna get this work no clue what to do
When I pull for the dismiss
This ain't a picnic semi automatic get to cookin' through you niggas like some Bisquick
Smokin' weed, doin' drugs
Days that be tellin' me I'm fuckin' up
I wanna mention that it be always in the back of a nigga mind that
One of these times I ain't wakin' up I know
Fucked from a young age
I tell people I've been cursed since birth
Feeling like they gon' find me on the floor with a body full of holes and my face up in the motherfuckin' dirt
First things first
Trynna make a mil and do it independent and if it wasn't for my fans than I'd be barely fuckin' livin' with the homies in the ally and the roaches in the kitchen plus I do it for my people trynna make it out of prison
So many people wanna come and copy ya
In a savanna it really don't matter ain't nobody stoppin' ya
I'm drinkin' bitter ain't no better than the shit I'm droppin'
But is why I'm laughing when you people say someone is toppin' ya, nigga
I live life one day at a time in a line on a Monday
Shit, I don't know what the hell is worse
Might end up in a hearse from my birth never church on a Sunday
Ain't nobody on my level maybe one day
I wouldn't get my hopes up though
I don't give a fuck about your favourite rapper I'mma dump knives
Fuck your little punch line flow
I'mma let you niggas know
To beat me it is gonna take a miracle
You just started doin' shit that I was doin' years ago
You be choppin' up a little bit
And comin' around out the back of the lack and all that shit, but you ain't really fuckin' lyrical
You ain't have them other niggas fooled
You ain't got it you should hang it up I'm sorry to be rude
When you comin' with the wolfin' I'mma split your fuckin' doom
I'mma reala killa illa dude
My face on the front page
I'm lost and I don't know why
I be in the backyard faded off of Olde 8
Understand hi is the time pass five
Shit is hella' crazy, a quarter mile trynna walk me an inch
So I said and I think to myself that I came a long way since I slept up on a bench
Thank you
