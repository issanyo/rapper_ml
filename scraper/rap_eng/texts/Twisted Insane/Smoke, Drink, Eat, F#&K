[Intro]
Brainsick!
Mmmm

[?]
[?]
Ya know
Put ya guards up homie

[Verse 1]
Now how many of these muthafuckas want they mouth split?
One hundred and fifty G's on studio time, no this is house shit
[Slip and?] never again will have no house bitch
[?] and no extinguisher can douse this
Murder music is what you hearin up outta ya [renavato?] with an XBOX on [the flow?] to play the Halo
With niggas [that ain't?] never been it, they go...
Hit a nigga's brains with Prego
Smear a nigga blood on the bagel
I'm one of them [?] mini boat bitches up in my state

[Hook x4]
Smoke, drink, eat, fuck

[Bridge]
And muthafuckas iiiiiiiis, yeah... [da da]
Listenin to that G shit nigga, that brainsick shit uh
So I'd invite you to just sit back and listen
Open ya ear wax, sit back and nigga just...

[Verse 2]
Listen to what I say when I do spit shit
Like some of these niggas is hatin... and some of these niggas addicted
Runnin up on me like "Twisted, Twisted, Twisted!"
I do any and everything if you listen to this shit
In this bitch, happen to be the one to never fuck with me
Now the bitches wanna fuck with me like a nigga got em all stuck on me
And I don't really give a fuck about these rap hoes
Hit em with venom and send em right out the back do'
Anyway, I move in through the dark
Move in with the guards
While I move in on the park and you move in on the heart
[Lest?] niggas'll get ya shit bit by the bark
Shit bit in the dark, [?]
Dump at the skylark
Don't stop till his butthole's in the gas tank and the shit blow
Nigga, then it's time to get ghost
Muthafuckas wanna act like they got 64s, but I been pimpin and [gatherin?] bitches cause nigga I got 64s...

[Hook]
