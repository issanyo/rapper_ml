[Verse 1: Charles Xavier]
Sea of my people, friendships what I'm locked into
But dammit I hate humans and I'd rather have my solitude
Cause y'all see evil, speak and hear it too
So do I, but I never let that get into the way of what I'm here to do
I gotta feed my son, and get my father out this raggedy apartment
So I Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum till everybody hear the giant when he stompin'
But we all still breathin', so tell me how can I complain
As we begin a new season, I'm jumpin out the beaches so that I can play

[Pre Hook: C. Ray]
But every time I step foot in this game I see
Everything that I hate about I love to do
And you know just how di-scouraging it can be
When you think that everyone has heard enough of you

[Hook: Charles Xavier x2]
(I'm burnt out)
When I write these songs (I'm burnt out)
And I lace this heat (I'm burnt out)
When I mix your tracks (I'm burnt out)
And I make these beats (I'm burnt out)
And tune in to the radio, I try, but everything that's new can't stand it (I'm burnt out)
And I feel like I'm running out of time, and I'm loosin' all my life like a candle and (I'm burnt out)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Long time gone, then everybody think I'm on some good shit
They really need to hit that bowl before they get to me and have me right back on some hood shit
Cause y'all see evil, speak and hear it too
So do I but I never let that get into the way of what I'm here to do
You know me, then tell me what you got up on my bo-dy
I live a life secluded on my lone-ly
Ain't got no time for dinner with my hom-ie
Frown when I'm not around, put me down and smile in my face
And I swear if another individual look at me sideways, I'mma catch a case
'Cause I know evil, you do too
So you better kill me before I kill you
But I got my people who have felt my pain
And now I got a lot of family and homies all around the world reppin' Brain

But every time I step foot in this game I see everything that I hate about I love to do

[Bridge: Charles Xavier]
Yeah, I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna spit the flu daily
And y'all not the dope that you advertise to me I hate it
See I am not confused, it's just you, y'all are kinda lazy
So we just sittin' in the studio just tryna spit the flu daily
