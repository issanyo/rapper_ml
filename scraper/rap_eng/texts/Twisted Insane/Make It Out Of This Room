She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)

[Verse 1: Redro Killson]
I got thousand problems, can't stop choking this bitch
She won't make it outta this room, got her wrist bleedin' and shit
Calm her down, give her drugs, put ten molly's into this bitch
She gon' die singing my shit, She gon' die singing my shit
I'm brain sick with this week change
When I'm force feeding these coke lines
Fuck her 'til she wake up, stab her 'til she float by
I've been waiting, so long, to catch you, in a dark hall
With a mask on, my knife meets and your heart's gone, I need that
You won't make it outta this room bitch, believe that, yeah I got you ho
Life is a bitch so I've chopped that ho
And left her for dead on a bathroom floor
I don't give a fuck if she find out, she'll be bleeding out soon
I made you a promise, won't make it outta this damn room

[Hook: Redro Killson]
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)
She won't make it out of this room (make it out of this room)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Will anybody give a fuck about me when I’m gone
Pour out some of your drink and pull off in a bong
And I bet some niggas will play some of my songs
And some other motherfuckers wouldn’t give a fuck at all
I creep in your house, I was quiet as a mouse, and
I was drunk as fuck and I was pissing like a fountain
All up in the planks and your living room, ready to meet your doom
Bust a gloom, puttin a razor on your couch and
I move through the hallways, murder always
Will you walk again? Depends on what the saw says
If you get the call from the Grim Reaper with the street sweeper
Comin' in the bedroom, killa all day
The ho was tryna make a move, I really think she lost it
I’ve grabbed the bitch up by the hair and threw her in the closet
She got to kickin' at the door, I told her “shut the fuck up
Or I come up in the bitch and I will flip you like an omelet”
I tie her to the bed and put the mask tape on her
’cause I’m knowin she’ll be screamin' when she feel that pain
When puffin' a swisher sweet I put the ash out
On her knee cap, when I did that she went insane
I’m ready for whatever nigga this bitch bring
It’s nothin' to be bustin' with the click click bang
I put ‘em all up in the freezer whenever they wanna release the heat
I cooled them bitches down and drowned them in the sick thick rain
I told you motherfuckers I’m a voodoo black
Magic in a night time and I meant that
And I’mma mind attack, remind you that
You will never make it from up out this motherfucking room
Because you’re where to find you at
Fuck with me and you gon’ make it worse, that I can promise you
I will show you demons turnin' everybody on to you
And when you start to beggin' for your life
I take the knife and cut you into pieces
Chewin' on your fetus like it’s ramen noodle
