Fuck that nigga, when I catch your man in traffic

Getting money then we ride

Steady be duckin' when I'm bustin' if it's beef we meet
?Coopin your Soddy? rippin' your body like a 3 piece meat
Funny how they talk about EBT
Now your bitches gotta see me on BET
Murder a nigga that givin' a fuck about MEB

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
They lookin for me and they find me up in these streets
I’m runnin up into ya house ya bitch skeet skeet
I’ll rip her to pieces now she’s prayin her way to Jesus
So I cover the ho with feces before I, delete
The strength of incredible hulk on PCP
And they don’t want get in my way when I do eat, thee, meat
You niggas don’t like to play by rules and use cheat, sheets
Pop, lockin on niggas like I was up on, thee, Beat, Street
Now murder opponent when I be up on it I hit em with some of that venom
When I get up in em I fill em with sick and i catch em one hot sweet heat
Ya don’t wanna be the one duckin from my deet deet deet
I’ll blow ya brains all over the bed and get some new brand new sheets
Nigga back up back up before you speak with me
The mumble up on the street is you SVPD
I’m too brackin for your bitches blood I ain’t fuckin with snitches
That gotta lie to a nigga just to speak to me
I’m sicko like psycho Michael but cycle like psycho seal
Slaughterin people when I say hey look at what I did
I am the one that nobody likes to invite because I do bite at you bitches
When I am fishin like what it is
The ouija board is speakin sin more fliers through your dickies
And if I happen to miss well then just try to come and get me
You try to catch me slippin comin dippin up in my house and I’ll be posted on the couch
With the mothafuckin .50, nigga
