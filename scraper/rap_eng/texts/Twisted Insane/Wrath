[Intro]:
Tonight we are going to have what in temporary Christianity would seem a quite unusual theme
But a most certain theme, very important, a very important one
And it is on the wrath of God
It is a very very important indispensable aspect to the knowledge of God and that is to understand his wrath
I'm going to ask brother Charles Leiter he is going to come now and teach
He is a pastor of a church in Kirksville, Missouri and be praying for him in this splendid and awful and difficult task, thank you
Psalm 7, Verse 11, God is a righteous judge and a god who has indignation everyday, everyday
Now how are we to understand this
What does it mean that God is angry
What is God's wrath, well the first thing I wanna say is this
God's wrath is not like the majority of all the anger that you've experienced in your whole lifeline
That's not what the wrath of God is
It is terrifying, God's wrath is his holy light hot hatred

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Pray to your Jesus
I know people who murder for beef fajitas
Now whenever they meet us
They wanna run away, label us schoolish and creepish
Choppin' bodies to pieces, my this is melodic
Robbin' all of you of your soul
They will all follow you now
But who will be standing when none of you go
I be standing with a drip up on my face
The world will race you when I come in with the wrath
Wish you got ahead too and when I open up the door
Take a look at everybody and there was a bloody bath
Shit, you do the math, people is dropping like ash
Process get often in your ass, put em up in the bag
Anybody living or forgetting this forbidden that you been finessed
Bitch you were so trash, your whole life was a lie
And you spend your time running from demons
Then you walk in the bathroom just sick at me
Three or four dicks are just covered in semen
But you told me you never will niggas be dead
But inept and sometimes triple teaming
But you can't get away from the wrath
If you think you can then your ass is just dreaming
Im what you think, im what you suffering
Dont give a motherfuck on what you think
He was just wolfing on you was a pussy
You don't wanna push me, hit you with the shank
Now homie that's real, I will lay back and waiting
Then I see you faded with the steel
Better keep an eye out for the wrath
Upon you will get you killed

[Hook: KNG DZL]
Bitch you about to feel the wrath, this ain't no 700 club shit
Smash in the Vatican, rappin' and speakin' in tongues
We the fastest baddest addicts and hustlers with mad cash
And you acting up back of the faggots showing you wrath in abundance
Bitch you about to feel the wrath, this ain't no 700 club shit
Smash in the Vatican, rappin' and speakin' in tongues
We the fastest baddest addicts and hustlers with mad cash
And you acting up back of the faggots showing you wrath in abundance

[Verse 2: King Iso]
Well maybe I'm a nonbeliever
And maybe that's the reason I don't talk to preachers
It used to be game like I'm off the bleachers
When I lure em with the buzz it was all facetious
There are too many faults that they often teach us
And die for us faults when they call beneath us
My tithes and my offerings all could be what
I bind with the rhyming but y'all could keep it
Want to seek for true knowledge, I'll do it first
And for my thunder, I'll bend when I do a verse
Hopefully truth emerges when you do disperse
Fuck humanity, my faith in the universe
Take every religion and tell me who is worse
Who really said it and who did the users worst
Most of the time, I see people that's truly hurt
Everybody getting looser than Lucifer
Tell me what you prefer
The wrath of a human ver-sus Saturn and Jupiter
Whats happening through the Earth
Is actually making people get the acting way loonier
Lose-lose situation but you could be lunar whenever you lose the earth
Like fuck the world I'm 'bout to do the dirt
That's not what I meant, that was too perverse
But when i do traverse, through the loops and hurdles
Of the world, I don't wanna make a move that's worse
So when you see me on the road and moving merch
I'm thinking everything I'm rhyming and I'm cool as hearth
Cause when I think about it, the way that the universe
But you can't stop that
Like plain Creator whenever you push on one top back
Guess that's why you feel god's wrath

[Hook: KNG DZL]

[Verse 3: KNG DZL]
Opening up to nobody a loner I'm zoning
And nothing get out of my head
Soak in the blood of the pope and I'm fucking a couple of ones
Please god forgive my sins
Toke another bomb and I'm off again
Far from anybody here and I'm a foster kid
Boston brought the bombs of promise was awesome
Run like you motherfuckers lost a limb
Oh too soon?
Shooting fags in a club with a .22 in a tutu
Then I zoom-zoom to school for the same shit, boom boom
New rules for the Buddhists
I've proven that you took a move with a mood that looks like me
Well i better put a vitamin in a box wonder when the blunt will get a little obnoxious, Jesus
There is no reason for every bit of hatred i take
Been flipping the fall of the world like fuck the whole human race
Carlos said Rose is a bitch and the bitch if it is then the bitch evidently is gay
If silk store, cancer's repulsive, convulsive lotion
Gaze of the bitches today
So take a walk through my town, welcome to the fucking downs
Munching knowing-it-all faggots always running their mouths
You think they missing a brain and isn't it strange
Think they give that I give a shit what they think
You work like a bitch for minimum wage
While I'm spitting admit I'm twisted

[Verse 4: Billy Cartel]
Sipping and sipping, they talking, rocking
Crosses lost and promises, never have I been an optimist
You might've been hot but not with this
I'm losing my mind so foolish or not
Thought you would decide to prove it to I
Put through to your ride
Threw two deuce to your nine
That toot that I shoot at the truth of your spine
Call an uber for rides and a stupid disguise
Chopper go blat, hitting you when it goes
Glock is unloaded, yeah I just exploded
Cause you thought you could think but are not to be spoken
And letting it off you get dropped in the ocean
Stayed in a place that your wallet get stolen
Suckers and pussy I'm not gonna roll with
Fuck up my man I am not with the motion
Can everyone fill out my rapper diss, trapping rapping packages
Slept on these fags with the strap and clip
Hoe you ain't worth two bags of shit
I came up feeling no optimism, broke as fuck, no pot to piss in
And every night these cops are trippin'
Bang bang, try not to miss 'em
It's crazy it made me degrading as fuck
Taking the homies and lacing em up
Fuck all these suckers who faking and fuck
And those who are sleeping, I'm waking em up
You stay in a way while I'm spraying your duck
Your stories a flop man you making em up
Ask the police if I'm slanging the stuff you punk
