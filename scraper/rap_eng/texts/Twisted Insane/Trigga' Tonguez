[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Choppin anybody with karate as i pull up on'em poppin everybody
Droppin somethin now they really runnin
Stood up on the grave bury him up in the cemetery
When you finished with the millimeter homie it is still beggining
Bust'em when i kick the door watch'em with the shit
People really wonderin like who the fuck I'm with
I dont really get it so i keep a wicked trigger finger
Feeling hella itchy
Imma pull on this bitch
I hit'em with the shit that make a nigga
Wanna get up out his seat and mess around a motha fucka like a rabbit
Only if i could a been a nigga workin at a mickey d's double cheese
But the swishers automatic
Homie it could be erratic but the devastation
Posted with the fiends
Im a sickling
When i rip beings
Never ping
When the clip sing
Hear the phone ring
Let your team get the beasting underground king
Ima lean on a nigga
Black mask toe tag so sad
When i hit beans on a nigga
I remember when it used to be cool
But that was way before the ratchet bitch put rings on a nigga
Hit 'em with the trigger when I'm spitting
I don't really care if anybody walking while sayin i ain't shit
They can eat a fucking dick
I'm it
Hit 'em with a bullet put 'em in the trunk then hop up in the whip
Then move to the wind
Grippin up on a motherfuckin 40
And im faded of the juice and the gin
Loosin' the swim
Doin' bout' 150 moving through the night
Nigga who's finna win?
Wasted
I don't really know if I'mma make it
I'mma fucking train until he gets to location
Bathe in a bitch guts
Right before I cut
Pardon me if i keep anybody waiting
I'm in the fast lane
With the Pedal to the Metal
Doin' about 108
Wait
Don't wanna be late
Shit
I'mma push through the night
Homie, I don't really wanna miss the brains on my plate
Remain hella great
Probably cuz' I always keep my zip to my own
And my lips on the bong
Anybody wanna go against that, hit 'em up
Make a muthafucka feel the clip, from the tongue!

[Hook: Loc Saint]
