[Verse 1]
And even if you wanna bitch
Because I'm popping off the switch
Lurk around the corner pumpin' off a nigga for the fifty so don't snitch
My niggas prolly got a fuckin hidden mini mac could drug it steal the money put the dirty body all up in a ditch
First that you say "Poppin' off the dome, smoking with the chrome" to figure out you're fear
Don't you worry thick, and here's some money for the chrome
Cause individuals took it no body 'bout to be there
Got you runnin' from a nightmare, I'm right there, with a light there, fight there, fly a kite there
But the pussy finna bite there, right there
But Im knowin' that a muthafucka' never fight fair
For the dope in the dome, I'm finna pop it off in em' it misses so what we get too pimpin' come wit' the automatic weapon to catch em' I pack a pistol or tech and begin to wet em' and pappin' em' then get too stealin' or recommend and then I'm wreckin' em' and if I can I know I never mention
That I'mma hit 'em now so he could take a bullet to the brain
Feelin' funny when I'm takin' money, do you think you yummy? yeah don't take me for a dummy I'm Twisted Insane
Unfortunate pain
Half of these bitches be off in the hood, rep wit' no shame
Put 'em in the ditch, hit the bitch with the cane
You two bitches time to start washin' the stains
And it gotta be a problem when I get too solvin' get the revolver
The witch who cut it off feet , I'm comin' off deep if you fear me
On the d-low , wanna be in love
Nigga don't wanna gobble the bullet up in the gut because a nigga don't scare me
I'm a Brain sick fiend, poppin' the bottles like I'm a casting cream
Lurk around corners like I'm a basket dream
Peelin' the bodies like I'm a bad dick crane

[Hook]
You have turned mentally insane and you will get your DOME SPLIT
They put a bullet in your brain and you will get your DOME SPLIT
You have turned mentally insane and you will get your DOME SPLIT
They put a bullet in your brain (in your brain) and you will get your DOME SPLIT

[Verse 2]
Leave your body in the mud, poppin' all off with the slug
Wrap our hands around a corner dropping off another bullet in the gut
My homies telling me to hurry up and get the party started we got honeys wanna take it get buttfucked
I had a body in the car I wanna be a murderous hider and seek another bitch
We was ready coming but I never let alone I always trippin' with a copper niggas better put it on with
Feeling crappy cause I'm suffering and they hit it 'em off gates, feelin' like late, their knee to my face
I'm feelin' the pain, the blood up in my cyst it got me hungry when I get 'em
And I take it to the pin and then I have to throw a grenade, it's funny go bang
Like I was dumb and whatever part of pity for part of whenever stuntin' but then a money get better
Get on, and nigga you better get on and you better get on, and nigga ya hangin' on
I'm sick, when you get to flowin' with a nigga that'll get a back up outta you my dome in a song get the chrome
For a motherfucker layin' on the ground like you screamin by the phone, it keeps on goin'...

[Hook] (2X)
You have turned mentally insane and you will get your DOME SPLIT
They put a bullet in your brain and you will get your DOME SPLIT
You have turned mentally insane and you will get your DOME SPLIT
They put a bullet in your brain and you will get your DOME SPLIT
