[Verse 1]
Yeah, oh shit man it feel like I'm sick
Dead to the brain, break bread is the game
They know the name, they gon' scream at the clique
Peep where we at, they done seen niggas trip
Windows tinted, and some bitches in the whip
We all lit, everybody in this bitch showin' it
Hoppin' out the whip with a stick
In my defense, I do whatever for my chick, where my shit
I ain't waiting, I'ma need it quick
In all cash I'ma need my [?]
Hit a lick, just give me what I want, and [?]
Ain't no rent, cause I paid for my shit, we legit
Tell it how it is, it make sense
Made dollars, niggas yet to make cents
It's hella smoke, they gon' need to make vents
For we air yo ass out and commence to make hits

[Chorus]
We ain't hidin' niggas know where we at
And we ain't trippin' 'cause we know where we at
Finna try, out here niggas on the map
In all black smokin' weed in the pad

We ain't hidin' niggas know where we at
And we ain't trippin' 'cause we know where we at
Finna try, out here niggas on the map
In all black smokin' weed in the pad

[Verse 2]
Oh shit man it feel like I'm sick
People always have to tell me when they take me to a party, don't trip
Never know if [?] up leave a nigga with his dome split
[?] that they put me in, I was on set
[?], fall deep,  on the slow creep in the whip
Schwarzenegger like to run a man with a rubber band on my clip
My everyday surrounded by [?] and riffs
Yo everyday on the Xbox with Capri Sun and chips
We lit, hella weed, but the kush is sweet on my lip
Tryna get it by the pound, at least buy a couple of vents
Bail up to the function, I think he suckin' off the fit
[?] homies, slappin' [?] DJ quick
Don't trip, [?] my shit
When its time to ride, when somebody die, that's who I'm rollin' with
[?] window when I hit
I ain't playing games, homie gon' pray, when I see the nigga that's it
Fuck [?]

[Chorus]
We ain't hidin' niggas know where we at
And we ain't trippin' 'cause we know where we at
Finna try, out here niggas on the map
In all black smokin' weed in the pad

We ain't hidin' niggas know where we at
And we ain't trippin' 'cause we know where we at
Finna try, out here niggas on the map
In all black smokin' weed in the pad
