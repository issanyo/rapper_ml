[Verse 2: Twisted insane]

I fill em with the [beam?] and body burstin' with the shotty catch em off a molly and i prolly open up ya guts
I send you too the devil after [we have settled?] if u wanna meddle with a motherfucker go n push ya luck
I'm a demon full of evil, i will fuckin eat you with the barbecue and make you wish that you were never livin'
A pistol whip you homie if u really want the drama i will turn into osama when i break inside ya crib
Shovin' a knife up in ya shit i was urgin'
To walk up in the motherfucker lit and then i cut ya like a surgeon
Man everybody know i put the work and i will never leave until i know the silly bitches are for servin'
I'm quicker than Serina i don't need a misdemeanor even tho i beat her i will beam a nigga with a scope
I'm a night time killer even when a nigga write rhymes
I'm with this shit no matter if i'm wicked, go
Puttin' a bitch up in the trunk and really gas her brotha' she had asthma drain her for her blood and the plasma
Said imagine, how i post up on the roof and when you walkin' up il shoot and now you labelled as a has-been
I'm overdosin' off of flow n' venom when i spit
You was watered down and i'ma keep it with the sick
If u run upon me it be like you stepped in shit black mask on my face toe-tag and you zipped
Young homie i'm an animal damage a nigga
Can't nobody hang with my stamina nigga
I'm brainsick hit em with the .223's won't you shoot through me who's an amateur nigga?
Fucked out my noodle bitch suck cock-a-doodle better suck every drop i'm so brainsick
Make hoes hit the floor then its up gotta go i be up out the door fore' i go ape shit!
