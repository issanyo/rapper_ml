[Verse 1: Mizury Mize]

[Hook: Cynical]
Everyone be wonderin' why I be on that dumb shit, I'm Reckless, wreckin' everythin' and I'm findin' it fun, bitch, I pop Another cap and run off in the night to run shit, I run this, Cause ruckus, I'm socially a fungus
I pop another cap of Fukitol!
1000 milligrams, I pop it all!
Then wash it down with lots of Vodkahol!
I make this world my bitch and fuck her raw!

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
I pull up with the pistol out the window

[Hook: Cynical]
Everyone be wonderin' why I be on that dumb shit, I'm Reckless, wreckin' everythin' and I'm findin' it fun, bitch, I pop Another cap and run off in the night to run shit, I run this, Cause ruckus, I'm socially a fungus

[Verse 3: Omega Sin]
Here, take a 1000 milligrams , prolly overdose like Michael Jackson did on deprovan
Pull up in an armored van coming with the cans with the wam blam thank you ma'am like I came here for the 100 bands
I don't wanna kill-em then get a way like the son of Sam
Hittem in the numbers like a pass from Randall Cunningham
I think I'd rather steal_em with a grenade and a gun in hand
Light your ass up like Dynamo did in running Man
Funny man , boon doc saint I'm a hunting man


[Bridge: Cynical]
Everythin' I do too much this time pops so Much Fukitol that I've gone and lost my mind

[Hook: Cynical]
Everyone be wonderin' why I be on that dumb shit

Wreckin' everythin' and I'm findin' it fun, bitch
I pop another cap and run off in the night to run shit
I run this
Cause ruckus
I'm socially a fungus
I pop another cap of Fukitol!
1000 milligrams, I pop it all!
Then wash it down with lots of Vodkahol!
I make this world my bitch and fuck her raw!
