[Intro]
I was hittin Swishers in my low-low
We would go front-back, side-to-side
And you were in my ride, but now you're gone... Now you're gone
We would go front-back, side-to-side
And you were in my ride, but now you're gone

[Verse 1]
Buy two, light-skin, but the ass for days
Pop bottle after bottle with the [?]
Suck my dick and then cook me steak
I would eat this shit up so good, have to work [to change?]
Remember all the muthafuckin stains on the shit
Some nut, some blood from the way that a nigga be
Tickle yo feet with the knife, she coulda been my wife, but I married the O.E. instead, life is life, with...

[Hook]
O.E. on the yacht
And I got the low-low cracked
So Imma hit mo' Swishers
She got freaks all around
And that one ho run around
So Imma hit mo' bitches
One ho don't stop the train

[Verse 2]
Drop-top, cadilacs with the diamond grill
Big rocks on my neck and this shit is real
Or I could pull up in the dusty Capris
Any which way it went, it didn't matter, she was coming with me
Is she down?
Nigga, check the tag
Brainsick, both arms, left and right, yeah, this shit was matched
But she couldn't stay off her back
Lettin any [blaine, weenie?] 'round town come through for swackin
[Is that?] nigga, what?! Is you absurd?!
Wanna be beat, makin fuckin [air?]
Gangsta rap reject, bitch you know who I am?
I'm Twisted Insane, the culligan man
And the [twenty for monsters to brew up?] in yo can, got two [on geak?], just couldn't say "no", the resistance was weak
Tickle yo feet with the knife, she coulda been my wife, but I married the O.E. instead, life is life
And that's... real

[Bridge]
That's what I've come to find out at least, homie
Ya know what I mean?
You never gon find that one, nigga
You may think you had that, nigga, but you don't, nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin?
Fuck em all, nigga
Literally
Ya understand what I'm sayin?
With...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
40 ounce bottles, just to ease the pain
O.E., weed, shroom, I don't fuck with caine
On a yacht, with a bitch, gettin super brain
This big ol' horse dick make her think I'm super main
Yeah, she big, but she ain't the same
Hundred and fifty dollas say that bitch don't know my real name
And she'll neva eva be my wife
I married the O.E. instead, nigga, life is life, with...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Keep it movin, nigga
Keep it movin, homie
Fuck em all, nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin?
Me and myself, nigga, I married the O.E. bottles, nigga, I'm married to the O.E., nigga
And the weed
Heh... I keep myself pushin
Brainsick!
