[Verse 1]
I am the same nigga that you will see creeping while sleeping up in your dreams
You look in my face, see the hate of a nigga that been drug through the mud, but clean
Hop into my whip, looking way too sick, y'all needs to hear my tunes
Turn up the 15's, show these motherfuckers, all hear the BOOM
Strap at the waist, get up out of my face when you're running with bullshit
Get hit in the parking lot, lookin' like Speedy Gonzalez when I'm moving
You should've seen the way they was running , like Brutus get hit with gray
They was all rushin', the chopper was bussin' and don't forget the grenades
They don't want the way that I'm punchin' and murderrin'
Nigga I will hit you with the venom if you with it
Nigga down for nothing, everybody got a purpose and  everybody got homies, and them niggas don't forget it
Hit 'em with the front then the back of my feet, then bitter and batterin' watch all the spatterin' like I was a spider in the night
Homie came in for the intervention, then he saw the nigga lookin' like spaghetti
Nigga get ready for this sick sight
Feelin' the beat in a dark room, no lights, camera, action, just nocturnal vision
Creep with a pistol when I speed it like a missile, motherfuckers keep looking like Daffy when shitting
Twisted Insane was sent by the one, the humans will turn away from the eternal flame
Into my stew when I'm off with my crew, introduce you to eternal pain

[Hook x4]
I'm on one, I'm on one
I'm on one, I'm on one

[Verse 2]
So Imma keep making my music and leaking my fluid while guided by evil
Speaking in tongues for the ones that don't understand, [?] like I'm Heasel
Hit em up with the voodoo, who knew they would now listen to me like I was a phenom
To those who don't boast [?], you've been exposed to a demon
Whenever they wanna get into, [?] into another level when i get em
[?] the feeling making them worry that maybe a motherfucka wanna kill em
Hoppin' all the way towards feeling of insanity [?] i be coming from a dark room
[?] kill them when I'm feeling like the hardest
[?], they'll think I'm absurd because people turn into gorillas
He killed his bitch on the first when he heard of my word, pointing at me like I was the killah
Look at what happened to Lurch, my shit could be worse if a nigga don't slow up and think
It was called turd, I was cursed, never went to a church, so jump off before you can see me

[Hook x4]
I'm on one, I'm on one
I'm on one, I'm on one

[Bridge 1]
Sick mothafucka I am it
My brain say little went through
Sitting in a dark room, zoned the fuck out
Just doin' [?]
Niggas be copy of a motherfucker
Industry deny me, now I'm hungry than a motherfucker
Imma eat they brains and they elbows
When they come Imma probably tell them bitches, "Hell no"

[Verse 3]

[Bridge 2]

[Hook x4]
I'm on one, I'm on one
I'm on one, I'm on one

[Outro]
*backwards*
Nah man, I'm the murderer of some of these motherfuckers, nigga
Yeah, someone got to do something about these motherfuckers
Niggas just be thinking these motherfuckers be the best that's alive
I would just be, in the dark with my
Talking about I need my shit, I need that-

Some of these motherfuckers they get they face with the-
I mean they need that motherfucker
I would just kill 'em all - kill 'em all
