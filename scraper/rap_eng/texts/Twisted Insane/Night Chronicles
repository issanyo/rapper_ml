[Verse 1]

I am the Brainsick heathen
Some will call me different cuz I do believe in demons
And they all end up screamin'
They all do it different when they suck up on my semen
You can find me in the night, posted in the alley with a bunch of fucking weirdos
Sick individuals that bite, Tyson motherfuckers when they chewing on these earlobes
Coming around the corner drunk, [with the incredible pump?], ready to dump, [slump and the bump on some screen humps?]
I told him "I am not no punk," cut him into chunks, then I left his body in the forest when I'm kind of Gump
Brainsick little nigga
Been that way ever since to get little niggas
Catch a fade, or you be a bitch little nigga
You gon' get what the fuck you get little nigga
Even a machete to your skull, niggas that get hit up with all type of different weapons
Even if the blade is dull, kitchen utensils used to my discretion
I'm the Monster in the Dark bark if you are gonna bite either that or be silent
You get ate up like a shark in the middle of the ocean with nothing but violence
Practicing black magic, you silly rabbit grab it, like I was an addict I gotta have it like a bad habit
Go ahead and have at it, they all end up with a disease, begging "please," for every nigga took a stab at it
No one can hear you for miles
You could even be like real real loud
Go ahead scream and shout
Anything can happen when the full moon is out
Night Chronicles

[Hook]

Murder you niggas
[look around the corner what they do serving you niggas?]

[Verse 2]

B-B-B-B-Back from the dead, trigger finger itching with the strap full of lead
S-S-S-S-Sack for the bread, is the reason they want me in the 'lac giving head
On my ding-dong, beat it on my chest just like a nigga King Kong
P-P-Polishing me bone, all you motherfuckers wonder "is he on?"

Y-Y-Yes bitch we on, shutting down this game for these squares and these clones
T-T-Till I have or I don't, and I kept my checks clean cuz they always on the [don't?]
T-T-To the top of the throne, and if they disrespect that, get the black of the chrome
Yak and it's on, from the city by the water niggas shooting for the dome
But to get back his own

But that don't really matter when you stay up on the [chrome?]
Always keep a weapon, if these niggas disrespectin', I will happily deflect them when their brains get blown
Hit these motherfuckers with the strychnine times outta ten I get up in the whip high
Aiming for the bitch eye, why try to miss when niggas will come back and put a bullet in my fish fry
Putting one in your lung, I'm doing it all for fun, I hit them without a gun when I come like a real one
Did it without the homies on my side, by myself up in the ride
I done been up in some ill ones
No one can hear you for miles
You could even be like real real loud
Go ahead scream and shout
Anything can happen when the full moon is out
Night Chronicles
