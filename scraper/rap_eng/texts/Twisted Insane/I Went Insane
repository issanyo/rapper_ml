[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Ok, I'm ready to kill em, and come inside your house
Without permission through a stereo affectin' many children
They could be influenced by my voodoo
And I spit that doo-doo, who knew? You be millin'
And ready to kick a  motherfucker to the ceilin'
I told you people that you're dealin' with some kinda fiend
A sicko, psycho undergrounded nigga by the sins
Can't get away, but it's my fate I really think it's not a dream
You can find me in a full moon
Runnin' through the forest in the middle of the night
Like I'm some kinda wolf-man
And runnin through you bitches like it's boom boom bam
This ain't for entertainment, this is who I am
Can't even reason for myself, I'm like a bipolar case
And by the way I got a K, I will spray that nigga
Pull up on his ass when he walking hop-out
So what everything you talkin' then i bake that nigga
I could be the bigger man and walk away, but fuck that
I was raised in salty San Diego, we gon' bust back
Fuck what you was comin' with
We don't give a shit 'bout nobody
But the homies we can take your nut sack
And I hope you will trust that
We gon' catch you slippin' while you sleeping
Tie you up with tape and drag you through the woods
Don't know who you was messin' with
Cut you on the section from your feet up to your chest
And then i bury you for good
Sick of everybody wolfin' on the internet
They're feelin' hella safe behind keyboard
'Til I come into their house
These motherfuckers talk about how they ain't even playin' shit
Then see how they was beggin' with the gun up in their mouth
And homie this is real, I give a fuck about a dolla bill
Cause when youâ€™re rich you really don't mean shit
And I don't even wanna sit around
And listen to a nigga tell me how many condo's is up
On his wrist... Brainsick!

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
Somewhere along the line I heard em say I lost my mind
But I don't never pay attention' cause I'm always high
Talk shit from safe places, that's the only time
And I really hate to say it but
Bitch I went insane!
(Bitch I went insane, ho)
Bitch I went insane!
(Bitch I went insane, ho)
Bitch I went insane!
(Bitch I went insane, ho)
Bitch I went insane!
(Bitch I went insane, ho)
And I really hate to tell you but
Bitch I went insane

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
Hey man they finally let me in this game
Hey man I can't believe I'm on a track with Twisted Insane
Hey man it wasn't long ago that I was shackled and chained
And with this ink all on my body I'm addicted to pain
Fat mans songs don't get no realer
Never one time said "I'm no killer"
But I know one thing, that's for sure
In my hometown I'm a known drug dealer
Came right up from the bottom, y'all
Tell em truth, they don't want no problem dawg
Fake ass rappers I'm hot at y'all
Because you always talk shit but won't pop it off
When the shit gets tight, we call the law
That's the only time that the cops involved
You ain't never did shit, you ain't never had shit
You ain't never been shit, no not at all
Man! Let me let it go
I'm tryna tell the truth, tryna let you know
Made it out the game with a reckless flow
I ain't got to call, collect mo mo
Kept it real, held it down
Repped it for that underground
Always kept that southern sound like Outkast comin' down
Southern playalistic, cadillac fuck your music
A Games the movement, just check it from my new shit

[Hook]
