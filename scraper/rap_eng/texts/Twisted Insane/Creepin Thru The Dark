*Minute of silence*

[Chorus X2: Redro Killson]
[This room ain't never for a sermon?], yeah
Some nights, some like it wet, yeah
You wanna be divine, understand the sum ain't yours, only 27 minutes left, yeah

[Verse 1: Redro Killson]
[?] [call back?]
I can pay you to blow, see these white bitches think they all that, yeah
[Gave em all my seed?], she only gave one back
Whitney Houston in the bathtub, Clive Davis [pulled the fuckin plug?]
Try to join the 27 club
[Go bring me?] my cocaine
[Amy told me do the?] damn thing
[See me pullin on my heart's chains?], yeah
Rudy Lewis [ say came to do right from his?] overdose, yeah
PCP on my lips, tryna smoke the fuckin [Holy Ghost?]
[Why it ain't up to me?] [?] fuckin [no?]
Stuck in this water, I'm Brian Jones
Now my dad is a Rollin Stone, all I got is this hole in my nose, [I mean?] hole in my heart [came for me in bed, I love you?] more than fuckin cane
As long as I give you my pain, I pray that [this room ain't never?] for a sermon, yeah

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Come on, 27 seconds [it could be a Ruger, find em and the ho done shot em?], nigga never had a chance to live a dream
It was taken from me, [now must take a break?] and I'm lookin at my body, thinkin to myself I coulda gon on bigger things
Now I'm on the road up in the Hell, I'm feelin like I'm caught up
In a [fuckin spell, n'?] doin it real with Jimi Hendrix
Fillin my family up with the pain, Twisted Insane, Kurt Cobain, Gary Thain, can I get a witness?
In 27 minutes, I be in the coffin, ready to be lowered down
It could be a murder, suicide, or overdose to put me in the ground, 27 rounds hit me when I wasn't lookin', but it really doesn't matter now
Shoulda got my body [drug em?] in the body bag [and they all runnin, oh just sow?], blood KA-PLOW
Wait by the gate, feelin like I'm in the Matrix
Feel like Imma na' get 27, I don't give a shit 'bout what the date is, as long as when a nigga go, I know I show much greatness, hence they will talk about a muhfucka like ([woah?] was the greatest)
Janis, [?] [drop to?] [?] [chop shop with?] [Mr. Morrison?]
[?] but I was faded, [jump right off a'?] topic
Take a dab, [?] with the homie and I'm fuckin lit up like a rocket, I shoulda listened to my daddy when he told me, "muthafucka betta' stop it."
27 [bitches?], later I was on a good one
Turn the [music and the party down?] like a [high blood?]
(Who got that nigga?)
The 27 club [could dare?], some drown, some overdose, some had to choke, hand in the coat
(Who shot that nigga?)
Bitch I'm 27 years ahead of you, ahead of you
Nothin' but dark days in a nigga past
[But then?] [?] a nigga [thought incredible?], 27 more miles left, how long will you last?
Follow the bright light when you dreamin
Hope you have a safe night while you leanin
Betta yet a safe flight fo' this evening
[Gaged?] by how many days, [yet a nigga?] lived through
27, I don't wanna go, I rather hop [?] in the igloo with 27 bitches [?] 27 pitbulls and thinkin Imma die, I'm talkin [?] kid you
Nigga this that shit fool, [to get a muhfucka?] [that could use?] your brain like Insane, blood on wasted
But y'all don't wanna get took off this Earth 'for you taste it
I could be about to die, 27 years 'for you say shit, brain

[Outro]
27
It's an unexplained statistic that's become both Rock and Roll myth and legend
I want to show people that I will last past 27
And they were unstable people with personality disorders
In a sense, we should thank the parents of the 27

[Chorus]

[Outro Continued]
Do you have any thoughts on, on why hard drugs and rock stars are, have become synonymous, I mean Billie Holidays and like whatever they went, they went through, I mean if I were them I suppose I would take anything that was available
(Understand the sum ain't yours, only 27 minutes left, yeah)
But uh, is it in any way a way of emulating those other people who...
Just wanna get high... I mean basically it starts with people who just wanna get high
