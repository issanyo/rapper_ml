[Verse 2]
[Twisted Insane]
In the dark with the mask on
Ready to blast and hoping the bullet hit em
Ready to hit em up and making' em feel the wrath
Fire upon his ass and lifting' him to the ceiling
Niggas so sick of poppin the 40 of penicilin
But niggas that really killen em put you up in the trunk
Hoppin up out of the whip with niggas that pull the pistol
You put em up in a pickle these motherfuckers will jump
Niggas be actin funny when they really wanna funk
I put em up in the dirt and then take em out to the trash
Then haul them off like hall off with a sawed off im all off that grass
Im not that nigga that you wanna fuck with homie im a theif in the night
I fill em up all with venom kill em all up everything in sight
Hm
My shit is mean i mean fill a nigga with gangrene
Niggas wanna trip shit
Slip on a clip
Then leave a nigga blown like charlie sheen
