Brain sick!
I am off in the wind
Yeah, i am off in the...

[Verse 1]
Brain rattle suck a lot of cleet
Fuckin their brains while they watch a nigga drain cattle
Even if it wasn't for the fame people lookin at me strange
Buts its really just insane babble
What the fuck is this nigga sayin while he be spittin
I dont know so imma take another listen to him
If u ever hear another nigga talking bad about the brainsick
And you're right there, do him
Imma go against the grave
I dont need a record deal because i got on your face
Till i blacked a motherfucker till im layin in a grave
So its twisted against the world that twisted insane
Sittin in a house hella skits
With a bottle and a stick watchin friday the 13th
Nigga like fuck every bitch
So im jacking my dick till its throbbing and hurting
Now we on night time shit
Ski mask lit hella bloods in the basement
Errybody louder than a motherfucker
Grandmama trippin get the thugs out the basement fuck
I was in the zone, she ain't stoppin until erryone here is gone
We only live once and we gotta live it strong that's why i clear the everclear out of a beer bong
Im on old english,ever clear, gang of beer, weed and shrooms
Fuck these niggas that dont like it
And then kiss my ass its just what we do
Half of the time there ain't really nothin to do
I be in the condo with a bottle of v
Everywhere a nigga go they followin me
And everytime a nigga leave i got a motto on me, im on

[Chorus]
Im on old english,ever clear, gang of beer, weed and shrooms
Fuck these niggas that dont like it
And then kiss my ass its just what we do
Im on old english,ever clear, gang of beer, weed and shrooms
Fuck these niggas that dont like it
And then kiss my ass its just what we do

Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
When i been all up in the kitchen steady servin heat
X2

[Verse 2]
Fuck with me
I be in the kitchen whippin heat like this shit was on iron chef
Walk up in the spot so god damn creased i dont even got no motherfuckin iron left
Feed me more i leave the pussy sore
They turn into a dinosaur like its a power ranger
Meet the guts and you can eat these nuts
Well shit im blowin up so much you would think im a stranger
Im just danger-ous like i was motherfuckin mac when he was up back up '91
I ain't really had no kind of asian yet
I think its about time for me to try me one
Okay bulldoze the game because it really seem like everybody is giving me the cold shoulder
Other rappers telling me that im so sick
But deep inside really want me to roll over
If i wasn't sober i prolly be wreckin your spot
Up above of your head like in a drunken rage
Feelin so illated tellin everybody that im the greatest to ever do it while smokin blunts
Dont give a fuck about these niggas on the radio, fuck em
Dont give a fuck about these niggas on the tv, fuck em
I did this shit all by myself and did it all without no help
But ill begin with just me pushin cds
And im sittin at the bar with the fans and shit
And errybody talkin bout im smashin shit
They ask if im comin up with a mask and shit
I said when it comes to this music im so passionate
Im stumblin away case my ass is lit
And i stll got a 40 bottle in the whip to drink
I had to stop over to earl up in the parkin lot
They ask me if imma keep pushin nigga what you think im on

[Chorus]
Im on old english,ever clear, gang of beer, weed and shrooms
Fuck these niggas that dont like it
And then kiss my ass its just what we do
Im on old english,ever clear, gang of beer, weed and shrooms
Fuck these niggas that dont like it
And then kiss my ass its just what we do

Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
Who ain't heard of me
When i been all up in the kitchen steady servin heat
X2
