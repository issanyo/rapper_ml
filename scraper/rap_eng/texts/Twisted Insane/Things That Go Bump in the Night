[Intro: Twisted Insane]
Johnny, I need something DARK
(Johnny Juliano)
(*speaking backwards*)
There are things that go bump in the night which the ordinary human will never truly understand
I will influence the lifes before me
They will feel my presence
I am king
If they do not kneel before me...
I will inflict wrath upon them

[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
In the middle of the night
I'ma wake up from my sleep
I will see'm
Like some kind of a green demon
I was in a wicked dream
And I mean never to think
I would blink
And wake up to this deep heathen
Now that I'm awoke
Gammin' at my throat
I might have to go
Ready, but they did want me to go, no
Is this some kinda joke
Cause you never know
When somebody's gonna hop out with some kind of video
Draggin' me down the halls, finna got me 'bout my testies
Scratchin' at the walls 'til my fingernails embedded
Take me somewhere ready, only lift 'em up, he deadly
Hit 'em with telekinesis, chop 'em to pieces like I'm Freddy
I don't know 'bout you, 'em, but I'm tryna really work it out because I (knew it wouldn't be my pay?)
He don't really wanna hear what I was tryna say so I guess that I have to find another way
Told me that he was takin' my soul for the wrongs I commited
5150, yeah, maybe I'm cookoo
Maybe because I'll sever you noodle
Or maybe because I'm babblin' doodoo
Or maybe because of [?] voodoo, I'm fillin' to you my venom
(And do you while hoppin and quick ill give it to you fill you and feel you that nobody stoppin him and steadily socking it to them and have them all off in a tootoo?)
I was really feelin' lost, in a green marsh
Put 'em off, with a chainsaw, and I feel raw
Maybe it was off with the leg
Off with the head, off, put 'em all in a nee naw
Run from the fight
Run to the left while you run to the right
Run for the dark while you run for the light
These are the things that go bump in the night
