[Verse 1]
It's the sick in my brain that a make you wonder
It's the sick up in my brain that make me fuck your grandmother
Put in the [?] and fend it sideways
Stay from coast to coast and [?] does it my way
Them liquid do or die days, motherfuckers get
Dirty donkey stains, sicker than pieces
Releasing over your nieces with Cheetos and chilled monkey brains
Giving a fuck and carrying 'em up and running 'em up, my shit is so nuts
My shit is way past psycho fanatic
With AR 15's, Chuck T's, and gang-tats
The human cannibalism, this motherfucker so phat
You can say what you want to 'bout me nigga, I will manage
With a big ass dick for that bitch to suck on
Imma take that ass back to the pad and get my fuck on
Beat it until it's bloody, please believe it
Fucking 'em up in the butt to the gut 'til its brains are leaking then I leave it
Matter of fact, the brains are still leaking out the anus
Give her enough, bloody nuff and still brainsick
Take a chick to the SuperBowl like I'm famous
But then I came back to the track and it's the same shit
Doing surveys in the mall, see its the same shit
It ain't got no ends and I really ain't got no friends in this game
Got no ends and I really ain't got no friends in this game
My name? My name? You know my name
Jumping up with the bump, see I was dumping when I came, nigga
Brainsick, trademark of the main nigga
See you's a lame nigga, gotta get your brain, nigga
I'm a bonified scary monster
Under your bed, bullet to the head, and shit that haunt you
Running in the dark, smash off into the Skylark with that nigga
Bullet to the heart, this is not my heart with that liver
Always represent this shit, Brainsick

[Hook]
You don't even wanna get to fuckin' with the brainsick (with the motherfucking brain)
Them niggas is crazy (they motherfucking psycho)
I said the niggas is crazy (motherfuckers so psycho)
And you don't want to get caught up and fall and trip (call this a motherfucking trip)
The south thinks he's crazy (crazy, cray)
The south thinks he's crazy (Brainsick Muzik)

[Verse 2]
Don't you hear me coming down the block with the Glock hot get my shit tucked
Don't you fuck around and make that [?] and get your shit fucked
Brain matter, nigga that's some of that [?]
Millimeter when I got the heat that's guaranteed to blow your cock and balls
Boom, boom, splattered the bed its all over the room and get
Watching my shit, popping and whipping and throwing it up with the click
I gotta be sick because I was always hell-bounded
Every motherfuckers in the reppin' take a fifth and if anybody found it
Drowning motherfuckers take niggas out the game
They see me, they acting all G but he a lame
Throwback jerseys, toe fades, and platinum chains
But that don't mean no thang against a mane with the name Insane
Brainsick, trademark of the main nigga
Fuck 'em up and cut 'em up like they playin', nigga
Yeah I'm psychos-tic, I must admit
But I guarantee that there ain't nobody in this game fucking with it

And that's real nigga, you gotta put your motherfucking time into this shit
Make sure your shit tight, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cause every motherfucking day, i be walking down the street
And niggas [?] trying to sell their punk ass CDs you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want your shit, nigga
Gimme a motherfucking refund
But it's always (Brainsick Muzik)

[Hook]
You don't even wanna get to fuckin' with the brainsick (with the motherfucking brain)
Them niggas is crazy (they motherfucking psycho)
I said the niggas is crazy (motherfuckers so psycho)
And you don't want to get caught up and fall and trip (call this a motherfucking trip)
The south thinks he's crazy (crazy, cray)
The south thinks he's crazy (Brainsick Muzik)
