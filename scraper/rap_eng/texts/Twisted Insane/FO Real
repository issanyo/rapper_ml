(Twisted Insane)
Yeah, I be on my shit
Put 'em in the river
I deliver you the sick
Demwonz won't you go into
The room and get the bitch
Put the pistol in her pussy
Fuck around and make it click
Creep with the wicked
Ain't no time to kick it
I been moving like a spider in the
Night time crawl
The bitch wasn't breathing
So we had to leave her in the hall
Get it wicked nigga
Im in awe, just like Saw
But its not a movie its real
Devil was there handling me the Uzi to kill
Peel, people skin right up off of they face
I just wanna get a taste
I ain't ate no meal
Brains and the bloodstains of my victims
Cover me, I was lucky, ain't a witness
Gotta flee like a track meet with the quickness
Ditch the heat, hit the side street with the business
Its people that be acting
They with it but they really isnt
Bitches, when you see 'em on the real life scene
People they be talking about how they got cream
Im about to let the bullet rip thru spleens
Zip thru Jeans , fuck it !
Imma leave a nigga leaking
Put 'em in a coffin just for mothafucking speaking
Keep it up and get yo whole face beating
Tell me why the fuck we gotta do it every weekend
No nice buddy , knife all bloody
Gonna kill , put you in the trash bag to be dumped (x3)
Its so sad but a toe tag with a full mag to be pumped (x3)
Any motherfucker wanna get it
Won't you go and step up to the plate
Thats about the time you will learn that Im psycho like Norman Bates
