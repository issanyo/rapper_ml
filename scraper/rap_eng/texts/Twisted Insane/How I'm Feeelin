[Chorus]
This how I'm feelin'
After a billion yeah imma make the haters feel this
This how I'm feelin'
All the talkin' ain't nothin homie i don't feel it
This how I'm feelin'
Came to party brought all my gangsters they the realest
This how I'm feelin'
All these pussies man they got me ready to kill shit

[Demzwon]
Got a hang over
I'm still drunk from the night before
Liquor flowin' through my system
Tearin' it up as I perform
If you cool with us try and get bodied
There's gonna be bodies all over on the floor
Goin' all out [?]
Which makes us ready for war
Only got real ones on my team
And most of them have been there since day one
Holdin' it down sayin' 100
[?]
Leave you leakin' blood
I've seen too many corpses
[?]
That's why i give em my archers
Form my music into an immortal
Puttin' everything into the business
This my last resort
It's time to make it a break
Sick of this shit can't take no more
Been through so much in life
That I don't think I'll ever see peace
But failure is not an option
So I ain't stoppin' for a thing

[Chorus]
This how I'm feelin'
After a billion yeah imma make the haters feel this
This how I'm feelin'
All the talkin' ain't nothin homie i don't feel it
This how I'm feelin'
Came to party brought all my gangsters they the realest
This how I'm feelin'
All these pussies man they got me ready to kill shit

[Twisted Insane]
Wake up and I'm still faded (faded)
Drinkin' bout a gallon of the liquor last night
Lookin' at my knife its all bloody
Thinkin' nothin' of it must've got into a motherfucking fight
I roll about a gram amount of weed
Put the millimeter in the center can pop it to get ghost
You don't want me to flip out and pull the heat I do the most
(ah ah ah ah)I'm not real I'm on a whole 'nother level
You can send me straight to hell
I don't give a fuck about the devil
I've done did too much shit in my life to try and make amends
My only friends is just the body and the shovel
One more blunt to the brain now I'm good
Shit i thought i never was gonna feel it I was wrong
I be in this motherfucker foaming at the mouth
Every time i see a fresh bowl packed in a bong
Let me hit it on a mission with the bitches on my phone
Trapped up and I got the homie for the back up
I ain't really even trippin' though
But you know how these little niggas wanna act up
Too much drankin' motherfuckers think they rebel
Comin' in shootin' like a mad dog
Blappin that Lambo
Killing everybody in this bitch
Have your little homie lookin like
Damn bro
