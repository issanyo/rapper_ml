[Verse 1: C-Mob]
Have you ever danced with the devil
In the pale moonlight, playing in the meadow
I can make you, like the hands of Geppetto
Or bake you like Hansel and Gretel
I give no offer list, often there ain't no stopping Chris
Often pissed off and talking shit, popping six on the opposites
From my esophagus, lava spits like necropolis
Choppin' with proper lead, I be droppin' shit 'til apocalypse
I would really much like to know ya
Plus I live just right below ya
Do you wish this rough life was over?
We have such sights to show ya
No care I give 'em I stare within 'em to tear up in 'em
My pair'll dig 'em, my terrorism, I'll share it with em
I'm there to get 'em, fuck with 'em by perishin' 'em
And you cannot stop my Carnage 'cause you are barely Venom
They said he wouldn't be shit when he grows up
But now my flow's sick and it goes up
Anybody wanna trip when he shows up?
Bitch you can suck a dick with a nose plugged
We can bring the heat
Thinkin' on my feet and I'm freakishly elite
Do not put your faith in trinkets of deceit
There is nothing that can save you from meeting your defeat

[Hook: C-Mob]
Since I was a baby I could feel the darkness inside of me
From the depths of Hades, but a good kid's what I tried to be
They called me crazy and the in-crowd never accepted me
Now I've embraced it, and they're about to see my devilry
I bring darkness, death, and hatred
Guess you should've never underestimated
Me? I take the beef and I escalate it
By the time I'm done you will be decimated
I bring darkness, death, and hatred
Guess you should've never underestimated
Me? I take the beef and I escalate it
By the time I'm done you will be decimated

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Come with me off to the dark
Ain't nobody get up out the situation
I ain't on the bright side
Everything you ever wanted, I will give it to you, pussy over there
You ain't gotta pay, why don't you come into the corner and spin a fight right
Nigga night night
Mind full of hate, brazed up with these sharks
So much time I think about the murderin' and tied up in the dark
Caged up aggression like an animal on the ark
I'm so Brainsick I might go schiz and then go cannibal with your heart
I'm really on Voodoo
Look what you made me do to you
Why in the fuck you push my buttons? I am cuckoo
Ready for the [world ?] mask on, strapped up I'm Shaka Zulu
It's like walkin' with a spirit of demon runnin' through you
And I was runnin' with a gun in my hand
That turn me evil, for all the people I'm a prodigal blend
But turn around and saw me standin' with a gun and you ran
And now that you's about to die you won't get bored with a man
The shit is awful, really unlawful
Lookin' down, I'm surrounded by bodies, ridin'
I'm gonna [drill ?] it again
Ain't no way to get up out the shits
Thrown at you cause got no balls and now the Reaper reapin', comin' to win
This shit is brazy
Will you take a walk on a dark side?
Turn into a demon, have nobody to save me
Devil talkin' to me and he told me they all die
When I open up the door and now no one will escape me

[Verse 3: C-Mob]
Coming wicked, the sickest
I throw a brick at the wig of a bigot, did it to
Split it, 'cause see I gotta be
So very vicious and this is the type of business
The devil dishes to bitches and there will not be apologies
Demons audibly speak and I be the prodigy
Heat that I keep inside of me
Peepin' is he the odyssey
Meet the unique dichotomy
Deacons say need lobotomy's
Needed 'cause I'm a freak and I'm deep in this demonology
I don't play so go pray
Lay low, stay out of folks way
Now obey or you'll pay
Let my flow spray, my foes lay DOA
There is no way you're fucking with it like Sol√©
Death dealing, load TECs and let's kill 'em
It's the best feelin', to de-stress depressed feelin's
Get the flesh grillin', hear the screams are deafening
Nothin' left in 'em, never testin' [Nephilim ?]
My mind is designed for the grind
Dark with these rhymes, no peace sign you'll be dying
Then police find your body up underneath lime
In the meantime, I'll remind a weak spine
No effin with me I don't need no weapon with me
Death is quickly coming, this is definitely not your element
I see your jealousy, now you will see the hell in me
I'm introducing you to my devilry, I'm devilish

[Hook: C-Mob]
