[Intro: Busta Ryhmes]
Attention please, attention please
This shit here feels like a whole entire WORLD collapsed
Motherfucker
Busta Rhymes now, M.O.P. now
What you want now (What you want now)
What you want now (What you want now)
What you want now (What you want now)
What you want now
What you want want want want want want buck, buck

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Ante up, no cut that fool
They want to act stupid gun-butt that fool
When I cock that tool, nigga run your damn jewels
Fore we fuck around and lay you up in your own blood pool nigga
Hunt you down nigga, run your ass down
Unleash the hounds til them niggas'll gun your ass down, stop it
You fronting like this was a thing of the past
With tattoos over the scars a nigga left on your ass
My niggas think lopsided, bust they gat cross-sided
In the subways they rob trains running along-side it
See motherfucker we don't play with that shit
And if you want your shit back you had to pay for that shit
You little costume niggas, Romper-Room niggas
Get you in the night or early in the afternoon niggas
We taking your whole shit while we pass through
Even the shirt off your back, nigga run that too

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I catch you backstage, give me the keys to the Escalade
You think you cute ho, take off them Gucci shades
I get my dogs to do you dirty, they all 730
Rock a ski-mask whether it's June or February
I take your show money, take your 'dro money
Yo, yap that fool cause I don't know money
For my peeps that hate slow money, I put em in the industry
So they can come and take all your money
Wish I could bring Pun back, bitch run that
Bitch run that, bitch run that
So keep acting like you don't know where the funds at
And I'mma show y'all motherfuckers where the guns at
Ante up, yo yap that bitch
She try to spaz out then smack that bitch
Ho you don't be rhyming, you still memorizing
Remy want them goddamn diamonds

[Hook: M.O.P.]
Ante up, yap that fool
Ante up, kidnap that fool
It's the perfect timing, you see the man shining
Get up off them goddamn diamonds
Ante up, yap that fool
Ante up, kidnap that fool
Get him (get him) get him, hit him (hit him) hit him
Yap him (ZAP HIM) yap him (ZAP HIM)

[Verse 3: Teflon]
(Ante up, yap that fool)
Fuck hip-hop, rip pockets, snatch jewels
(Ante up) what, my whole family nuts
Run up yo' stash house, tie granny up
Make you strip butt-naked
Young buck got struck with the gun butt
For what? For tryin to tuck the necklace
I'm young hungry armed and reckless
On the streets with a death wish
Don't hide when you see me, I'm on the guestlist

[Verse 4: Lil' Fame]
(Ante up) Show no mercy
B.K., nigga, thirsty thirsty
We bang hollows, you misrepresentin the game
Motherfucker you're lame and your chain hollow
Hit him (hit him) hit him, flash the tech
Yap your chain, smash the lens in your specs
Listen, it's Lil' Fame right
With that Brownsville mentality to Shanghai

[Verse 5: Billy Danze]
Hey yo I'm firing outta coppertop city with a whole empire
A clip full of blue-tips and a hand full of fiya!
Eat deep dirt nigga, it's Berk'
I put in work until it hurt nigga step
Easy out the truck punk, 'fore I leave your ass leaking
I'mma bang til the springs in this thang start squeaking
Die cocksucker, boom bap, boom bap
Aight motherfucker, what's wrong with you

[Hook]
