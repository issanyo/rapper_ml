[Intro: Fat Joe]
Yeah, yeah, it’s the West Coast remix
Westside's the best side
Snoop, Game, E-40

[Hook: Infared]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana]
Shorty, what you want? Shorty, what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You niggas riding in a Lexus
I’m floating outer space with Elroy Jetson
Battlestar Galactica, who rollin’ with you?
I’m way up, twisting like the solar system, so official
Air traffics, notified
Blow the whistle, old pistol, forty-five
My weed miss you, these weak bitches horrified, glorified
Bitch you better get your story right
Or disappear, vamoose, Papoose
That’s my nephew, so you know we got the juice
Loose lips sink ships, trip this for a second
I’m all the way up on this Fat Joe record
Don’t let me down, I’m too high for you to get me now
22 years on top so you could never forget me now
There’s no way to shut me down
Rock and roll with the Lion if you’re with me now
Hit me now
I’m back to the Snoop shit
LBC, Eastside, that’s the movement
Gangster music, do it, do it, I do’s it
I make it rain, pop, pop, bang

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse 2: The Game]
You can catch me Milly Rock-ing through Manhattan
Kobe retired and Brooklyn on the bandwagon
Hundred bands in my pockets got my pants sagging
My granny still tell a nigga 'pull them all the way up'
Bentley truck splashing on 2 Chainz
Got it on monster truck tires, I’m in two lanes
Hop out, Marty McFly, my kicks Liu Kang
California plates, black and yellow nigga, Wu-Tang
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, yeah Old Dirty Bastard in this Mulsanne
My whips change colors like a mood ring
I hear that Big Pun playing, nigga turn it all the way up
Back on my bullshit nigga
I’m a Golden State Warrior, fuck that Bulls shit nigga
Steph Curry with the pot, Draymond with the Glock
Turn your body into clay/Klay, I see your truck and shoot it all the way up
Catch me on the West like 'Ye
Or on the East like Dave, hear my beats by Dre
And if a bitch in my DM’s, I know what’s up
She tryna fuck, pull her panties to the side and go all the way up
Now let me see them hands, throw them all the way up
Like I’m DJ Khaled, put ‘em all the way up
Make a Westside, throw it all the way up
They looking for Eazy, I point it all the way up

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse 3: E-40]
What you know about turning a quarter zip into a half a brick?
Making it out of the ghetto without your wig split
Wrist watches that don’t tick
With the international warranty card that comes with it (BIATCH!)
Courtside seats, arena suites
Shining, got diamonds, 10 thousand dollars in my teeth
Cool with the hustlers and athletes
What you make in a year, I make in a week
I can eyeball and hand-weigh the yola, I’m an appraiser
Put you out like a cigarette butt, shut down your circuit breaker
Got a key around my neck, clientele and clout
Longevity like that boy Kevin Liles and Steve Stoute (Bosses)
One hit wonder what I’m not
I used to rap back in the days with Pac
Believed in myself, went with my gut
Tell ‘em pimp

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana + Fat Joe]
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12V
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
