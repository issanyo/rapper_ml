Are you dumb? *laughs*
Are...you...dumb?  Are you dumb?

I want to thank God first and foremost; I've been through a lot!  To everybody who think there's no such thing as second chances, I'm here to tell you that's a lie!  You just gotta keep working hard.

Shoutout to everybody in Bedford Hills Correction Facility, Albion Correction Facility, anybody on parole; it's hard, but you can do it, you can get second chances, you can make mistakes and come back.

My husband, Black Love, I love you Papoose!  When I didn't believe in myself, you believed in me.

My business partner, MY BROTHER, Fat Joe Crack!

The whole entire team, Remy Mafia!

I just want to say:

"Y'all bitches got fat while we starved,
Shots in your ass, pads in your bras,
Y'all some liars, it ain't no facts in your songs,
And YEAH, THAT CROWN IS COMING BACK TO THE BRONX!"

Queen La, I see you Kim, I see you Cardi, M.A, I love y'all!
