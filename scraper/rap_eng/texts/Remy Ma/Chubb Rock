[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Yap yap, straight from the top
I ain't even waitin' for the beat to drop
You see all these bitches hatin' but they need to stop
Because use it ain't my fault I spit ether god
Most swag than you ever could have
And the purse worth more than the money in the bag
Stupid, y'all bitches make me laugh
You should quit niggas got you gassed
Y'all try to do this, me, I does this
You should see me when I'm with my cousins
Yeah, we buzzin', y'all just buzzards
Y'all thought that y'all was poppin', but y'all wasn't
Y'all pop two bottles and you think you stuntin'
I pop ten bottles like it's nothin'
Please don't worry 'bout who I'm fuckin'
Ima homewrecker, I'll fuck your husband
Easy
Microphone checker what is this
How many times I gotta tell these bitches
I'm like a infomercial I'm about my business
And I just got started, y'all been finished
And everybody know Remy hard as fuck
I drive dolo through the city in cars and trucks
And they starstruck, All shucks
All y'all broads is washed up
Ya gotta
