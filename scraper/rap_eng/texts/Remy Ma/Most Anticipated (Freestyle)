Turn it up louder
Most anticipated
Something Bout Remy nigga
Look

[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
I ain't thinking bout bitches
I'm on the road on promo tour
You in the hood fucking for free
Straight promo whore
Dildo in ya butt that should be your logo slore
I send you prostitute bitches on a porno tour
I had few exclusive spots but they ain't low no more
I heard you stopped by now I don't go no more
I send  40Cal shots through your Volvo door
Yo I rock more Chanel than that Coco girl
You coppin knock offs acting like its really a Gucci
I hops out the Porsche in Emilio Pucci
And walk up in the corner store and get me a loosie
And I dont even smoke just to shit on you groupies
And get a brown paper bag so I can sit on the stoop see
It dont more hood than your girl Rem truthfully
Like Keyshia and New Jack City the movie
Rock a bye baby you niggas is Pookie
And I got that crack
I dont know nothing about slow money
Grey base, pure white
Call me a snow bunny
You never fired a gun I keeps it so gully
My gun fire like Mike Saunders for  Payola Money
I'm conceited Rem could never be ugly
I take a Chinese chick ass before a face like Buffie's
The rumors is crazy, I must really be that bitch
How can I have time to pipe Pap and yall on his dick?
Picture me robbed by a washed up video chick
And how I'm arguing with Foxy and she can't hear shit?
Matter fact dont even ask me nothing bout nobody
With a clit, a pussy, a ass, or some tits
I ain't gay I can only tell you bout dick
And thats word to the saliva in my mouth I spit
That shit like none other
Fuck ya baby mother
We piped in the crib
I wipe my pussy with the baby covers
Yeah I'm crazy I know bitches hate me
But really ion love em
And yall can't make me
Nope
