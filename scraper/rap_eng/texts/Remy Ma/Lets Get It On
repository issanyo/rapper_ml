[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Remy Ma is that bitch
Plus the camp is here
When I come through call me kiss cause the champ is here
These bitches kill me claiming that they best
Bet you take that bass out ya voice when I cave ya chest
Your 15 minutes of fame been came and left
And I just started bubbling yall bitches are in trouble man
One phone call and you finished cuz my squad stay on the double
Man we got cannons, handguns and toys that go blam-o-blam
I dont think ya mans and dem' understand that
When my boys get tight they'll pop like a rubberband
And you when you get shot its gone shock all ya other mans
Like when SDot brought in JL that SummerJam see
I'm Remy Ma see to tell the truth I dont give a fuck
I do all yall bitches like I did that chick in Lady Duck
Sleazy, I swear to God it's too easy but
I can't stop now the industry needs me nigga

(Chorus: Remy + Fat Joe)
You wanna get it poppin bitches?
Ok Lets get it on
U wanna see Remy just pop a bitch then?
Well lets get it on
It cost u 20 just to hear her spit (Listen)
Terror Squad I know you fearing this
C'mon Lets get it on
U wanna get it popping bitches
Ok lets get it on
You wanna see Remy just pop a bitch then?
Well lets get it on
Rusty opps or a hollow tip
Cockback and swallow it
Remy been a  problem bitch
Now Remy making profits nigga

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
A few years ago I was really tryna be lenient
Since yall acting like  fried chickens I'ma do yall greasy
Believe me Remy is of the heazy I run shit round here
Like my name was M-Easy
Ain't a need for u to ask where Rem been
You know I'm getting guap , when the face of my watches spinning
I got BET all on me, MTV calling me
The cover of the XXL, and The Source see
The Vibe is next, they signing checks left and right
Everyday I'm catching flights was in LA last night Miami this morning
See I can go thru any weather , curls got me G-foreign
So when I say I gets fly
I really be getting fly
Smoking haze on the plane or then really I'm getting high
And you just be getting by looking for a handout
Stop Hummer stunting you frontin let the can hang out nigga

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
Look Pun opened the door and now I'm in it
Terrors the squads and cook coke Cracks the lieutenant
I always thought of Remy Martin as a sergeant
But I'm cool being a kernel cuz now I'm poppin'
I spit so butter I'm still so gutter
Switched up and still flows like no other
I'm like yea yea yeah lean back
I'm in a NY state of mind stressed , like where the fuck the pheens at?
Cuz I got that crack
And I ain't talking bout a pack
See my niggas gone dont make me have to bring em back
I'm reppin the X, T-s on my chest
That nigga wildn and ride em N yes emto death
So we can go to war see
Thats a true story
I got niggas with weather millas that kill and shoot for me
And I dont hate cha but
When you on the top of New york you tend to do things of that nature
