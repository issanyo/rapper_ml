[Verse: Remy Ma]
Yo, I'm a real bitch, these sluts ain't
Six years I did upstate
I did walks like I'm on a catwalk
These bitches walk like they butts stank
See my jewelry, you'll see rock
Like that imported vodka that Puff drink
Embrace the haters, I love hate
Cause y'all showing love, but that love fake
I'm from Castle Hill where they pump weight
The murder rate high and the drug rate
Them thugs love me, I got blood money
Cause I stash my money in a Blood bank
I been doing good, my son great
Y'all better have my ones straight
Hurry up, I don't fucking wait
I'll eat her food on my lunch break
Cuff me they uncover the truth
These hoes lie, yeah her too
Art of War, I'm Sun Tzu
I'm back bitch, don't know what to do
Your run was short like a (?)
Your hood where the ops live
Speed across the Ed Koch bridge
And pull up in front of that thot crib
I don't argue that's bum shit
My Mackage gets unzipped
Reach on you then dump clips
Punish her - that's Pun's shit
They all lost already
They don't want me to win
I'm 'bout to kill these hoes - Scott Peterson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
