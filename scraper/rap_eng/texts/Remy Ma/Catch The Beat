[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
Said that I got it I'ma give it and take it to these bitches
And once I start ain't no stopping I'm talking no intermission
I know these bitches be listening
Steady think I'm dissing em
But they pussy they ain't tryna fuck with Reminisce and 'em
My flow got a cold and I'm really getting sick of dem
Spitting holy water they dont want me to glistening
I'm from murder murder Castle Hill
I pull out the burner burner melt your ice grill
Remy Martin ain't no bitch ill as me
Only chick I like is Lauryn and she Hennessy
Call me infinity cause ain't no end of me
You ain't a blood relative you a fucking enemy
I smoke alot of weed but I got alot of energy
Type to fuck your man in ya crib where your dinner be
Wearing yo robe making noise while ya kids asleep
Call you on the phone so you can hear while he digging me
Yeah I know you feeling me, these females be killing me
I'm a grown ass woman so you can't be kidding me
You need a laxative cuz yall bitches can't do shit to me
No you a hoe you can't change your identity
See I bust guns, and I cop keys
You in the studio like (I'm tryna catch the beat)
You really think your better than me?
Bet your G, bet your piece , whatever I got extra cheese
Like a hamburger, no dude you ever heard of
Is anywhere next to my nigga shells burner
It's a problem out the gate
And you know they gone hate
When they rewind the tape
And that hear that nigga Gates
Steady tryna catch the beat
Can't even fucking catch the beat
