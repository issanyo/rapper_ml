[Remy Ma]
He put the gun in my hand
I took my hand and put the gun in my pants
I took my pants and pulled 'em up on my ass
Got the cash out my pocket, dropped it and got my ass out of Dodge
And put it into the car, started it
Stepped on the gas, looked at the dash
95 really don't seem fast when you so fuckin mad
And you so fuckin high and you can't stop cryin
Oh shit, I just ran a stop sign, fuck it
It's nothing, this nigga got me stressin
I can't believe he got me buggin now I'm drivin wreckless
I can't even see and my highbeams ain't really helpin
But nobody really be usin the streets before 7
Got the pedal to the metal like I, lost my mind
And I ain't even see the school crossin sign
Car and the bastards yeah, wind blowin in my hair
Seatbelt light's blinkin but, I don't care
Somebody was crossin the street, came out of nowhere
Ran right into him, body flew in the air
Oh my God, my face already covered with tears
Sayin my prayers, I ain't even seen her I swear
I stop out of reflex, saw blood everywhere
Mostly 'round the head of the little girl holdin the teddy bear
I'm sorry, all I can hear is I want my mommy (mommy!)
And then I ain't hear nothin from the little girl's body
I'm scared but I can't stop, what I'm gon' do
The first thing the cop's gon' say is it was drug influenced
They ain't gon' understand what this nigga was doin
How he made me drive fast when I shoulda been cruisin
And they probably won't believe that it wasn't the weed
And shorty just popped up, in the middle of the street
And they really gon' be hatin, this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty pulse and I don't think she gon' make it
Dial 9-1-1, or damn should I run
I'm just weighin out my options before somebody come
If I stay I go to jail, if I run I'd be wrong
This is takin too long, fuck it I'm gone
Hit and run, damn I shoulda hit my brakes
Hit and run, sometimes we all make mistakes
Hit and run, I guess I'm not that heartless
Hit and run, cause now I got a guilty conscience
