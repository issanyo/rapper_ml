Fuck outta here, nigga
No bet chill
[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
See the girls back home like mulberry
Now they call me Hag and Daaz 'cause I got ice
I got cream in my car cherry, Remy Ma ready
And not to contradict my name
See I don't really like to play the bar heavy
I'ma pothead, so even if my eyes not red
I ain't got an enemy that's not dead
Oh, you a hothead, I'll leave your head hot
You know, I got lead when you see that red dot
And plus I'm dead nice, these bitches dead not
My chain Flinstone, bracelet bedrock
And when I'm not in Miami, it's hot like Miami
I got twin Glocks call 'em cotton and candy
I got cousins that get it poppin' named Tequila and Brandy
I spent like 10 thousand just shoppin' for panties
Know these bitches can't stand me, catch me hoppin' out that Cadi
Shawty gased up 'cause I'm frontin' and I'm callin' him daddy

(Chorus)
If he ain't a looking good then I'm like no bet bhill
If he don't keep it hood, I'm like no bet chill
If he ain't actin' right, if he ain't packin' like 9 inches
Then I'm like, yeah right, no bet chill
If he ain't gettin' dough then I'm like no bet chill
He don't want me to smoke and like no bet chill
He tying stupid shit like I'm a groupie bitch
Then I'm gon' flip yeah right, no bet chill

[Verse 2:Remy Ma]
Homie, I ain't impressed 'cause you dropped 450 on a New Jersey
I just dropped 450 on a crib in New jersey
But I'm from South Bronx, muthafucka, you heard me
I can tell you a bird 'cause you get up to early
You actin', askin' who's really that bitch
I know a fever when I see it you ain't really that sick
I spit full blown, you a mile cold
I'm 21 years young, y'all bitch wild old
Can tell you in your 40s like you pushin' 40
Got like 4 kids and trynna be somebody's shawty, stop
You really need to lay off the cock
Y'all bitches Bacardi Breezers and I'm Remy on the rocks
Watch and I ain't talkin' 'bout a chain or a watch
I'm talkin' sum Joey crack shit, I'm 'bout to get a match
And you know the summer comin' I can use another drop
Got the ghetto barbie but I got a lil' pop, pop

(Chrous)

[Verse 3:Remy Ma]
See I know how to rhyme and I'm nice on the mic
And I know how to ride 'cause I'm nice on them bikes
And not for nothin', I'm the type to wife
See I can cook and clean but I like to fight
I had this shawty like to bite I called 'em Iron Mike
Changed it to Jack Frost 'cause he started buyin' ice
If I'm lyin', I'm flyin', never catch me cryin'
You'd think I was down with the clipse the way I be grindin'
See a lot of chics is sick but I'm the sickest one
I got 99 problems but a dick ain't one
I got 99 guns and I still ain't done
Until this day I wish that I could bring back Pun
Yeah, I know you can't take it, kid
See, it wears the pants in this relationship
But you gotta love me 'cause I'm so real
When bitches try to hate 'em, like no bet chill

(Chorus)

(Remy talking)
What do you mean do I love you?
Of course I love you , I love all of y'all
Yeah, Larsen, I got my chills let's be for real
