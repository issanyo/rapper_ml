[Remy Ma]
You already know its not a game when the guns is clappin
See its hard to scream for help when ya lungs collapsing
You was standing there laughing, yapping, acting as if it couldn't happen
And ya ass got popped
You the type to go to jail when ya ass get popped
Little faggot ass snitch start talking to the cops
So sad Niggas is crabs and bitches is pussy
Qnd my trigger fingers itching nigga dare u to push me
You can find me any day hoodie down in the boogie Bronx
Pounds of the brown, right on the Boulevard
Yeah Remy Ma nigga, whats good really thought I wasn't the Type to squeeze the mac milly
I hop off the bike and smack a bitch silly
Cuz I asked for a Dutch and she bought me a Philly oh
I'm so nasty moving at a fast speed with no intentions on stopping so how u gone pass meï»¿?
