"Remy Ma - What's Going On"
(feat. Keyshia Cole)

[Verse 1]
[Keyshia:] Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Heeeeeeyyyyyy
[Remy:]
Why Didn't I See The Signs I Was To Busy Getting High
Runnin Up The Studio Smoking Dro Writing Rhymes
To Blind To Notice My Abdomen Was Growin
Having Sex Wit Out Protection Now My Belly Is Showin
Nobody Know That Me And My Boo Trying To Decide
What To Do He Buggin Like That's A Little Me Inside Of You
It Ain't True And I'm Scared And I Can Tell He Is Worried A Bit
So We Proceed To Get The Weed And Straight Ignoring The Shit
My Jeans Don't Want To Fit Every Morning Hurling And Shit
I Had To Tell My Family I Knew They All Was Goin To Flip
And His Was Happy Thinking He Was About To Be A Daddy
But I Knew It Wasn't True Even Though We Both Wanted It So Badly

[Hook:]
Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong
Can You Hear Me Lord When I'm Callin For Give Me My Baby
How Am I Supposed Feel The Situation Is Real
Neva Wanted To Let Cha Baby Go We'll Meet Again I Know Baby

[Verse 2]
We Love Each Other Madly So Much To Gain So Much To Lose
I'm In Pain Your Mind Frame Change When You The One That Gotta
Choose Talk A Walk Step In My Shoes Think In Negative Thoughts
Politics And Shit Quit When The Doctor Says Positive It's A Life Living
In My Body But It Don't Gotta To Live It's Up To Me But If I Keep What
The Fuck I Got To Give I Mean I'm Still Young And I Don't Really Have
Shit And If This Nigga Up And Leave Then My Child A Be A Bastard
This Is Drastic Nobody Really Understands Me And My Mom Don't
Give A Fuck And Neither Does The Rest Of The Family They Like
Remy You Can't Afford It You Expect Us To Support It
I Feel My Seeds Apart Of Me And I Don't Want To Abort It So:

[Hook:]
Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong
Can You Hear Me Lord When I'm Calling For Give Me My Baby
How Am I Supposed Feel The Situation Is Real
Neva Wanted To Let Cha Baby Go We'll Meet Again I Know Baby

[Verse 3]
I'm Not Steady But I Can Get Ready For Responsibilities Shit Where
Would I Be If My Moms Got Rid Of Me I'm So Stressed And I'm
Under A Lot Of Pressure But All I Need Is The Remedy To Make Remy
Feel Better I Knew I Couldn't Win So I Chose To Forfeit Its A Shame
I'm Over Four Months And I'm In The Doctors Office I Swear To All That
I Love That I Wanted To Leave And Wait Five More Months And Birth The Child
That I Conceived But I Sat There Because I Felt I Had To And I Cry Everyday
Because I Realize Boy Or Girl That I Wanted To Have You Don't Be Made At Me
How It Is Is How It Had To Be And Any Pain I Put You Through Is All Coming
Back To Me

[Hook: Repeat Until Fade]
Tell Me What's Goin I Know What I'm Doing Is Wrong
Can You Hear Me Lord When I'm Callin For Give Me My Baby
How Am I Supposed Feel The Situation Is Real
Neva Wanted To Let Cha Baby Go We'll Meet Again I Know Baby
