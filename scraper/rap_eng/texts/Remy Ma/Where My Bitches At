Where my bitches at?
Where the fuck my bitches at?

[Verse 1]
These chicks know who I be
I got this rap broads scared to death of me
I drink gallons of Yak, smoke pounds of the weed
See, Duchess alone gone cost me a G
If I need a hot track I'ma call Lay-Z
Like what up Ma I'm coming thru
And my mans is dimes they coming too
So while I do my rhyme they doing you
Yea I love my bitches they keep it gully
Monday room bars havin drinks with sunny
With all my ice on till they turn the lights on
Lefty gun in my right palm like Myson
Bad chicks, mad you ain't know I get my style on
Witcha fucked up face looking like Dylon
Mad makeup painted and piled on
It'll prolly crack if you smile wrong

Look
Done up I'm a dime
I'm a 9 when I'm natural
But dont get it twisted bitch I'll still smack you
Your friend wanna act up?
She can get smacked too
Ok wanna play then them things can cop
It ain't a thing anyday I can pop your top
And I just got started ain't about to stop
Admit it  the flow retarted and the girl is hot see if remy ma the best then i guess you not
See  most chicks want a dude with a tool with a nice clip
Me I want a tool with a scope and a nice clip
You know a N1 or a AR15
Equipped with shell catchers night vision and end beams
Plus extra bullets for all the haters
I keep it street like Styles and flow  sick like Jada
If the squad was the Lox I guess id be chic, background like suck my dick all over the beat
Walk with me

Like Pun said
I ain't a rapper I dont rap
Think I was pink the way  they scared to catch eye contact
Bitch you ain't crazy
You dont wanna get smacked call me miss vma
Bum bitch lean back
Lean back you don't want
What the fuck you can't be serious
And I can't be touched bitch period
I know you hearing it my name gotta heavy ring
I got them screaming "damn Rem on everything"
Thats word to everything
You can catch me anyday anytime
Any hood bitch heavy bling
See that's gangsta
I'll get my up north niggas
That just came home to shank ya
