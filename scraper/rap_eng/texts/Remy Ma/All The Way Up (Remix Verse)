(I'm All The Way Up)

It's funny that's my timbs got moon dust
Up here wit MJ, and the room's plush...
If a hater talk then I get they tomb rushed...
Certified grave digger, don't get ya crew touched
Bars? I murder, slaughter and body em..
Bodies everywhere like rappers getting pilates in
This ain't the Panda beat, illa spittin true ether
Diarrhea all over the beat, call the zoo keeper
They don't want the issue,  nah they neva did
Got shooters up on the roof, &  they neva miss
All these snakes out bragging bout the better hiss...
Top 5 or dead alive...  Aim for the legends list
They having trouble reaching the potty, they hella pissed...
I'm talking to the team, like what the hell is this
These degenerates are prolly making Ellen pissed...
So next time ya hear em talking... Tell em this...

(I'm all the way up... )

It's funny I keep the Reaper on speed dial...
In case I need Cochran to come and fix the police files
Grab the weapon that OJ used, and OJ crews, til they leaking OJ juice...
I know they moves, every time they move they  make a post...
Casper, Tommy,  and phantoms when I move I make a ghost....
Biggie and Pac tendencies, I move & take a coast...
For my next move, I'm just praying they taking notes...

Nope... I'm done but I bet now they know what's up...
I'm always down to carry a casket,  that's how they know it's us...
Sleep these rattlesnakes, give em the cobra clutch...
One shot, aimed for the dome....  It's over bruh
No reviving at all, now it's a murder case
Big Mac, splitting they whopper give em the burger face...
Set em straight, in case they ever got it wrong
I'm a pallbearer, they call me so I can homi songs
