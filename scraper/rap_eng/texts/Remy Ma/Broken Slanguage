Uh
Base your eyes on the guy
Who travel from the Bronx to Bedstuy with my ride or die
Leave your jaw wired, Kanye
Niggas getting hit up on the highway the NY way
The bread winner, killer, lead giver
Reggie Miller shot hitter, crack cocaine rock dealer
The unleasher, one who cops sneakers
The kid who fly every Easter, the Mastercard and the Visa
The jewelry remover, the point prover
The nightmare, Freddy Kruger, the car jacker, take your Uber
The case catcher, the thug who hate rappers
The young master, the heart colder than Alaska

[Remy Ma]
The stabber then slap her with the hammer, the toe tagger
The troublemaker, the I-hate-haters hater
The thot popper, the rockwilder
The Bronx bomber, the twat proper, the drop top driver
The great spitter, the I don't play with her
The cake getter, rape niggas, the jail upstate bidder
The college graduate, diploma hanging on refrigerator
Bitch trasher, stuff hoes in the incinerator
The money maker, the chicken flipper
The Lou Vuitton Red Bottom sister, the Dom PÃ©rignon sipper
The Bloody Mary but a lot scarier
The realest bitch out
The [?], a single ox carrier

[Papoose]
The Goodfella, the hood dweller
The spelling bee big word speller, the thugga thugga yeller
The getaway driver, the king of drama
The money splurger, the truth without Sojourner, the back block lurker

[Remy Ma]
The four-fifth gripper, the one bitch
[?] low clips, ain't scared of no ho who bleeds once a month bitch
The boss bitch, the first and the winner
The long line skipper, and still the hottest chick on the market, nigga

[Papoose]
Grim reaper, the freestyle leaker, the gun in the speaker
The New Jack City repeater, brother's keeper
The comatoser, who never sober
The shoulder holster soldier, the black Gucci loafers
The strong stamina, world tour, UK down to Canada
Big tipper, they're scared of us, giving racks to panhandlers

[Remy Ma]
Brick smuggler, number one weed customer
The club rusher, the known gun buster
The shot caller, the one who more real than all of them
The band holder, the dealer taking out the jokers
The weed planter, the car scammer
The hip-hop, Fetty Wap jammer, the Milly Rock dancer
The mob hitter, gun in my bra, the bra lifter
The scar giver, I spit fire, Godzilla

[Papoose]
The artist disser, the pissy elevator pisser
Blessing my soul with Easy Jesus, the ENJ sipper
The Mr. Mackie, kept it real since Pataki
I kept a gun in my khakis since niggas was wearing clothes baggy
The beef bringer, swing like Venus, Serena
The Alphabetical Slaughter recorder, the Nacirema Dreamer

[Remy Ma]
The Giuseppe wearer, quilted Chanel chick
Mrs. Get Fly, the fleek bitch, the streak crash street bitch
The hood rich, the Instagram lit
The Facebook sick, go on Twitter just so I can block a bitch
The title stripper, black bottle Rozay sipper
The bitch who pop wheelies nigga, the motorcycle lifter

[Papoose]
The man smart as MacGyver, the heist schemer
The Joe Pesci, find you and leave you, the life leaver
The letter writer, got to support the lifers
The one who killed the BET cypher, you nice but I'm way nicer
The illest rapper, the mic snatcher
The Benjamin dead pres' stacker, my wife got a record bragger

[Remy Ma (& Papoose)]
The bitch in the mirror
(The man in the mirror)
The rest of them fear us
(They try to be us, my vision getting clearer)

[Remy Ma]
The big wheel pusher, I hook off on a fucking hooker
The good looker, I'm still a queen you hood booger

[Papoose]
The block swerver, the one twenty learner
I send you to the voicemail, the call curver

[Remy Ma]
The bullet in the burner, killing you motherfuckers

[Papoose]
She got my back, I got her back, so they never snuck us
New York's number one shooters

[Remy Ma]
Mickey and Mallory, the Bonnie and Clyde overdoers
