Bitches better spit some shit
Cause once I get my pen you know is a problem
Niggas think cause Rem got money, that I won't fuckin rob em
Attitude, you should call me Diddy, the way I'm boppin
Keep a, deuce deuce, like OG Bobby Johnson
But this ain't South Central, I'm from the boogie down Bronx
It's queen of NY, you just a princess of the projects
A bitch bummy with lil money, these hoes sho' is funny
Go cash your WIC check bitch , ain't yo kid hungry?
By the way your kids loves me, and ya man love me
And it just gets worst, I don't think you understand honey
You see I call him daddy, and he calls me baby
And your son is so cute, he calls me pretty lady
And your daughter I spoil her, I know you really hate me
Damn, what has your man done for you lately?
It's crazy I know he's never there when you need him
Cause from the AM to the PM we be fucking when I see him
We be touching, sucking, humpin, lustin, loving when I see him
You be buggin, I'm wassup, it's really nothing when I see him
When you see me you get sick, you know I'm doing my thing You probably puked, cause I'm cute, when you saw me in King
And whats really fucked up, is that my album's coming soon
Got damn, it must really suck to be you
And its hot to be me you ain't got to think of me
Just don't listen to radio, read magazines, or watch TV
See, I be's the hottest chick on the market
Reminisce Remy just Rem or Remy Martin, bitch!
