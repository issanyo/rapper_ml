[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
I left the factory I was on the 645
Got dudes runnin' up on a don like yo bitch so fly
See I been talkin' to the kids and the kids don't lie
They like R to the E-z M to the Y
It's the hottest chick out and yall really got a problem
But I know how to solve em
We ain't gotta rob em
We the Bronx bombers we Timberland stomp em
Semi-automatic or trade revolve em
The squadron the hardest regardless I'm heartless
Once said I was the type to fuck your baby's father
Now all these snake niggas tryna crawl in my garden
But I need a dude with an anaconda

(Chorus)
I need a nigga to hit it and quit and me scream (Ahh)
You know I'll pull the trigger let it squeeze (Ahh)
Down South I heard they go for 17
I got the stash spots in the V, nigga please
Got damn
Remy is so hot, yall hoes is so not
I'm hot like a coke spot
I'm burning up
Remy is so hot, yall hoes is so not
I'm hot like a coke spot
I'm burning up

[Verse 2]
Hey , Have you eva eva, eva, eva in your long leg life
Seen a cutie with booty got a flow so tight?
See I really can rhyme and I know how to hold a mic
Work with the purple and the green, and even better with the white
Plus I'm rich bitch I'm a real big timer
Your in a line up with Nickel and dimer
I'm spinning dollars on platinum and diamonds
Got the old school rims on my old school ride
Yall liars and I'm as hot as fire
Bout to change my name to Jambalaya
Bout to change the game from all the priors
You should do the Jay and just retire

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Yo, you don't gotta tell me that I look good
White Airs, white tee, damn I'm so hood
Whenever I could  I rocks my hoodie Reps the Boogie where You'll get smacked out for talkin loud to me
And the word around town is that  it's no game
Yall know my name and I'm not playing
I flow insane, was flown on a plane straight to MIA
Got that beat Novocaine, set the streets ablaze
Yeah the girl is flames I'm in heavy rotation
And I'm killin the tape
Don't a day go bye I don't got a date
It's like everyday's my birthday got so much cake

(Chorus)
