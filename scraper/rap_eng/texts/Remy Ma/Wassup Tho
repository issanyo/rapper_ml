[Verse 1: Remy Ma]

I'm tired ion wanna fuck
I just wanna lay back and just suck
I really wanna go, Cuz I just wanna cum
But i dont want cock, I just want tongue
Its nice and hot you dont need no plate
I want u to eat me  nigga stuff your face
You'll love the taste I'll love the feel
On my heels,  enjoy your meal
Yeah, give me some head
How u like being fed in bed?
I know u wanna dick me  I don't mean to be picky
But I'd rather have your mouth instead
Wassup tho?

(Chorus)

Wassup bitch, Wassup ho

Wassup bitch, u tryna fuck tho?
You tryna go?

Like me
What a bitch like, what bitch like (like what)
Like me

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]

I'm not in the mood to have sex
I told you I just wanna get blessed
It's no panties under my dress
You do a good job, I might do u next
Open my legs, kiss my lips
See, Oooh..nah just give me 60
First you lick then u suck
Slurp it up, lets oral fuck
Yea, give me some brains
I wanna see if u can make it rain
I know wanna pipe it, and i'll probably like it
But tonight im in the mood for a change
Wassup tho?

(chorus)

(Hook ) 2x
I'm sorry but I'm sexy
And all I want u to do is just bless me
All I want u to do is just bless me
Just bless me
Just bless me

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]

I got a message from my thighs
And my thighs  they never lie
They said it's not gonna hurt, but its not much work
Cuz the na-na never dry
I got a message for your mouth
Tell your mouth to go down south
I got a 1 way strip , this a real short trip
Lemme show u what I'm talkin' bout
I wanna do it like this baby
I wanna do it like that sugar
You know what I need boy
You know what I like boy
Like this baby
I wanna do it like that sugar
You turn me on, and on and on and on

(Hook)2x
