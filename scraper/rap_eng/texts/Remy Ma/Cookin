Montana
Skrr

[Bridge: French Montana]
Bad bitches, fuckin' everyone of 'em
Ten chains, rockin' everyone of 'em
I'm in the club, bitches beggin' me to shoot 'em up
With the seventeens, sixteens, there ain't a new one up

[Hook: RySoValid]
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Summer's gone and we still doin' Lebron numbers
Make Rihanna want the Don on her
Bag alert, Goyard on the duffel
So much beige up on the plate niggas swear I'm shavin' truffle, han
El Chapo notice me
He said work forever, my lady got bricks of Jodeci
Don't it look like I been cookin'?
Trump in the trunk, half a ticket in the cushion
Hit it once had to curb da hoe
And she ain't even know she was a squirter, yo
Bad bitches, mami with the slanted eyes
Half black, half white, that's my panda vibe

[Bridge: French Montana]
Bad bitches, fuckin' everyone of 'em
Ten chains, rockin' everyone of 'em
I'm in the club, bitches beggin' me to shoot 'em up
With the seventeens, sixteens, there ain't a new one up

[Hook: RySoValid]
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I got a lot of bread, cause I'm gettin' dough
Yeah I got that cake, I be on the stove
We are not the same, I'm one of a kind
It's my time, you hatin' on me, get in line son
Rem on the mission, I'm in the kitchen with Joe and
I just chiefed up a yacht, I'm tryna whip me a Boeing
Mami you're like average, I'm in the white palace
I'm out in Dubai, everybody lookin' like Khaled
The match chinchilla, my pets been killa
I'm cookin' like it's the last Thursday in November
That means it's Thanksgiving, I'm making baked chicken
I'm on my second plate, and your pieces ain't hittin'
What it look like, bitch?

[Bridge: French Montana]
Bad bitches, fuckin' everyone of 'em
Ten chains, rockin' everyone of 'em
I'm in the club, bitches beggin' me to shoot 'em up
With the seventeens, sixteens, there ain't a new one up

[Hook: RySoValid]
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'

[Bridge: French Montana]
Bad bitches, fuckin' everyone of 'em

[Hook: RySoValid]
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
It look like I been cookin', it look like I been cookin'
