[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
It's been 3 weeks since the diss from Little Kim
The one you played it once , and never played it again
Remember when she told yall she was bout the Benjamins?
Yall act like yall ain't know that she wasn't writing then
To begin, how you think you really gone pretend
Like you got the crown and you nicer than Rem
Plus when, you had to get your stomach pumped from swallowin' them kids
If you did it then, then you'll probably do it again
Talkin' out your face saying you from Brooklyn
With a fake nose and fake tits
Now that was the sin that Kimberly end
It ain't my fault that the record didn't spin
You ain't gotta ask cause I'm nice with the pen, girlfriend
Lemme break it down for you again
You know if Rem you say it then its truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really just a gem
Babygirl Reminisce is really not the one
Your peoples lying to you and you believing em', see
Remy Ma is only human
You act like you ain't been through the same predicament
At the radio station I shout you out when you was in
