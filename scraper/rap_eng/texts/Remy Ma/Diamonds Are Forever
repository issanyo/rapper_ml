[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
You see these old bitches they dont want it
They already know I gotta watch these young bitches
Tryna master the flow
You know the ones by the backdoor handing me a CD
Talking bout when they make it to the top they gone see me again
It ain't that I ain't impressed but I ain't pressed
See I don't listen to these bitches
But I ain't deaf and I ain't blind shorty must be outta her mind
I'm watching all yall motherfuckers, yea who the fuck want it?
And got everybody ducking bitch ain't CEO
Ands thats an acronym for better instead of them calling us hoes
And if you ain't coming with us , then you know you gotta go
I seen Young Jeezy and told him I got that snow (yeah)
I'm spitting like I'm still in the projects
22 forty-five apartment 9F
I never did Lean Back, and I ain't on yet
But in my mind I'm 18 and Pun ain't gone yet (check)
I'm banging on the table in the lunchroom
Crispy Jordans, matching Jansport, NorthFace snorkel
Recording in Q crib, using towels to soundproof it
Still battling the Blood bitches in Soundview
I'm smoking beef & broccoli in the lobby I be pollying
Niggas bringing niggas to the block so I can body em
Bitches really hating cuz they heard they husband hollering
But I don't give a fuck cause in the hood Remy like Rhodaman
Keep a heater, I'm a leader and I got some followers
Told em Ima take them from the projects to the promised land
And I ain't lying man you see I really mean it
The girl Rem's on fire I got these bitches heated
I'm undefeated and If these chicks is looking skinny
It's cause people heard of Remy and none of these bitches eating
And man forever-ever-for eva-eva
I gots the crown!
