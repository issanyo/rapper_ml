(Chorus)
We got plenty cars
Pull up to the club they know who we are
We gotta couple bottles we buy the bar
Terror Squad be the clique, tell em who you are
Me, I'm Remy Ma
See I'm a dime nevermind the scar
The Queen of NY dont make me pull ya card
Bitch I don't give a fuck imma superstar now


[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
Me, I'm a serious problem
Reminisce if you nasty Ms.Martin
I'm the type to beg your pardon
Flowers on the casket , [?]
Me, a certified Bronx Bomber
Castle Hill residence straight out the projects
5'9, brown eyes, skin chocolate
My hair half blue and half blonde bitch
Me, I'm super paid
And I do is Malibu and haze
I'm that bitch that'll catch you backstage
Saying bitch told you take off the Gucci shades
Me, I be where they sip lean at
Hot girl of the summer make ya niggas lean back
First lady of the squad Murda Mami, TS
Take a pull up in the car
And the size of my Rims are older than me
And I'm 22 going on 23
Ain't a need for cash cuz I don't pay for shit
Security see my face and valet my whip
Rem!


Me I'm nothing like the average see
You a bad girl, me I'm a bad bitch
And now that we got that established
Yall can stop askin how I feel about female rappers
Me, I don't really give a fuck see
And you dont wanna rump with bumbaclot me
Whether it's for free or a hunnid G's
Or your imaginary but it's got GT
Me, I'm in the hood with a hoodie on
On the run getting eating getting my Sam Goodie on
And I'm looking so good , homie got a Woody on
Either I'm so right or these hoes are really wrong
Me, See I'm quick to say that anytime you can get it
Not only can I rhyme I'm photogenic
And everybody got camera phones so the windows tinted
The rims is spinning but you gotta stare and if not it looks like I'm floating
I call video hoes ghost its like they not there
I gets the paper so i dont care
