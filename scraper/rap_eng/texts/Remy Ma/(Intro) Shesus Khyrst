[Hook] [2x]
If Jay-Z is J- Hova
And Nas is God son
And I was spitting crack to the people and die son
And then I came back like I never left nice
Then I'm the BX Savior , Shesus Khryst

[Verse1:]
That's right I don't listen fuck with you told me
I shits on these bitches niggas can't control me
Pissed on my contract , dissed Ms. Joey
Now I call him Sprint cause that mothafucker phony
Ya'll looking for Rem? Well I'm roaming literally I'm in Italy Nigga I'm holding, puffing that young six piff
I'm smoking you popping that E mothafucka' you rolling
See Pun told em shes so nice and when it comes to the pen That she was like some of the greatest of men
The way she would write
And now I'm the BX Savior Shesus Khryst
Don't mention my name in vein no bitch surpasses me
Don't piss me off and I should not commit a casualty
I'm the best none before none should come after me
Talking against Rem ? Now that's blasphemy
Actually I'm laughing cause what could you say?
See I stay fresh and my swag up crazy
Plus these chicks lazy so how you gone stop her?
When my spit game sick and my whip game proper
See her in Hollywood or you could see her on the block
And they telling me I'm the one number one chief rocker Evolution is evident these old chicks Genesis this is Revelations And I'm the New Testament
