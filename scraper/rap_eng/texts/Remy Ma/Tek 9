(Chorus) (2)
Tek 9 plus a AK (2x)
Chrome to ya dome! (2x)

[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
My name is Remy Ma and I don't play
I let that led fly in the broad day
A nigga push up like a bra I'm strapped
He like "yo ma what's that? "
I'm like "Oh thats in case you  wanna get clapped"
I just click (pow)
Chrome to ya dome leave you face down
Bullets logged in ya bone
Yeah I'm a rapper but it ain't just rhymes
So what's you know about turning a autograph singing to a crime scene
Throw something on my stage and I'ma bust in the stands
Wouldn't mind going to jail for clapping one of my fans
You don't want it with Ms. Martin see
Everything bother me
And I really got a serious problem with authority
Keep thinking cause they  always think a chick a never shoot
Till I bust at they feet leave him doing the Chicken Noodle Soup
Tone Woppin it's a reason why I'm bopping
Resurrect the dead so he can tell you what I got bitch!

(Chorus)
