[Intro]
Everything is real on me
Yall know what that means
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Remy Ma Madness
Let's go ..

[Chorus]
Bitches talking shit when I was gone
See they quiet now that Remy home
Talking tough but they fear me though
All these little bitches ratchet
Me I really bust my ratchet
Mess around I really clap it
All these fat transfer implanted bitches
All they do is ass clap it (hoes)
Coulda took a little dirty snotty nose kid
Turned em' into bastards (forreal)
I coulda turned into a casket
I coulda put her in a casket
Yall probably mad im still rapping
I know yall mad im still laughing
Im the realist bitch after reality tv Im going into acting

[Verse One : Remy Ma]
Yall know how I give it up
I never really gave a fuck
On parole smoking blunts
My piss clean in the cup
See these hoes can't trust em'
Hoe fucked your cousin (ew)
Then you went and cuffed it (ew)
These niggas disgusting (forreal)
These bitches disgusting
I don't wanna discuss it (why)
I violate these [?]
Cause these bitches soft
I spit on the dick then i lick it off
Im the best of both worlds nigga
Im not the average girl nigga
Throwing shots but you not a killa
These bitches deaf i dont hear em'


[Chorus]
Bitches talking shit when I was gone
See they quiet now that Remy home
Talking tough but they fear me though
All these little bitches ratchet
Me I really bust my ratchet
Mess around I really clap it
All these fat transfer implanted bitches
All they do is ass clap it (hoes)
Coulda took a little dirty snotty nose kid
Turned em' into bastards (forreal)
I coulda turned into a casket
I coulda put her in a casket
Yall probably mad im still rapping
I know yall mad im still laughing
Im the realist bitch after reality tv Im going into acting

[Verse Two : Remy Ma]
I be ignoring hoes
Dont come for me If i dont send for you
Ima go so hard on these bitches that
Motherfuckers forget to remember you
Can't say i ain't try to be friends with you
But you gone make me put an end to you
Trust , you don't want smoke with me
Cause you won't go home where you post to be
Keep playing i'll smack a hoe
My shit be laying a bitch got bundles
Look how it's swinging they call me rapunzel
Azelia Banks , Ms. 212
So tell me what the fuck you wanna do
20k for a walk through
All yall bitches run through
And wonder why niggas don't want you
Wack bitch !

[Chorus]
Bitches talking shit when I was gone
See they quiet now that Remy home
Talking tough but they fear me though
All these little bitches ratchet
Me I really bust my ratchet
Mess around I really clap it
All these fat transfer implanted bitches
All they do is ass clap it (hoes)
Coulda took a little dirty snotty nose kid
Turned em' into bastards (forreal)
I coulda turned into a casket
I coulda put her in a casket
Yall probably mad im still rapping
I know yall mad im still laughing
Im the realist bitch after reality tv Im going into acting
