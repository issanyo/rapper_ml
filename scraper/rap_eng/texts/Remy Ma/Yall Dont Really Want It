(Chorus)
Really it's really nothing
Bitches be really frontin
Niggas don't give me nothing
Take everything that I want and
Soon as I get confronted
I'm telling niggas run it
Yall don't really want it
Nah yall don't really want it

[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
I switch my flow but I'm straight from the Boogie nigga
You know my style black Tims black hoodie nigga
Yeah it's clear , its my year
Remy Ma run shit round here round here
I kicks that southern slang it's from from right thurr
Oh you got bitches coming? Where they at? Right where?
Wife beata, Nik-errs, nice jeans, nice hair
Gun in my purse, ice all in my ear
So who the fuck you think you talking to bitch?
Know who you fucking with
The Bronx Bomber ,Ms.Martin  government name is Reminisce
And you don't really wanna piss me off
Look you dont wanna push me
They say you are what you eat so you know that means you pussy
(Right)I'm in my  Hummer stunting, I'm on the Henry Hudson
Don't care which lane, so  I switch lanes from left lane to right lane its nothing
And I'm doing like a 100
So how I'm gone dump my Dutchess
See niggas is nervous
But I'm swervin on all yall mothafuckas

(Chorus  2x)

[Remy Ma: Verse 2]
(Damn)
The pedal scuff my Chuckers
And still can't no one touch us
If the world was free of suckas it wouldn't be no one but us
Remy Ma get it on  and prospect
Sunshine, Big Pun, and Joe Crack
Terror squad and you already know that
Bitch threw two at me  I throw four back
Bitch hold that, yeah throwback
As a matter of fact  wait hold up
Tell me this beat ain't a beat that make you wanna
Get some weed and roll up
See my ears, my neck, my wrist, my fingers look like water froze up
I'm a p-i-m-p I got male groupies
Hot damn jeez down there  hoes up
When I say hoes I mean bitches
And by bitches I mean ladies
See No bitch could ever play me
Push a aqua green Mercedes
And you driving Ms.Daisy
Rem be driving em crazy
I'm big pimping just like them niggas Bun B & Jay-Z

[Verse 3]
Ok ya girl is here the night is right
My gear is  crazy ,crispy white on white
Just got the trucks valet and
I'm here a little late but who really gives a fuck
It's  not like I gotta pay
Hate these dike ass security with grown men hands
You half nigga, my squad got in with all the cans
But you know I gotta cop a bottle soon as I step in
I don't even drink like that I use it as a weapon
Why you think I'm gettinig drunk poppin Corpse
I'm just patiently waiting for something to pop off
And these bouncers is fucking cowards
They think cause they brolic
That they can't get smacked with a bottle of Hypnotiq
Now they tryna tell me that  we can't smoke in the club
Dont give a fuck about a , but I'm smoking my bud
Somebody better tell the kid Remy dont really care
Set it on anyone, anywhere
Bitch I ain't never scared
