[Bridge: Tamia]
With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
Everytime that I'm near you
I realize that you're heaven sent, baby
I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me boy
There's not one like you around

[Chorus: Tamia]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

It could be the way that you hold me
It could be the things that you say
Oh I'm not too sure what it is boy
But I know I like feeling this way

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Tamia]
Oh I really like
What I feel when I'm with you
Your a dream come true
Don't you ever leave my side
Cuz it feels so right

[Chorus]
