[Verse 1:]
One look in your eyes and there I see just what you mean to me
Realize that being single ain’t all what it seem to be
Been around the while and I see the scenery
But when I go to bed at night is you that I want sleep with me
Here in my heart I truly not for nothing do believe
I don’t need shelter, don’t need water, don’t need food to eat
I don’t need clothes, I don’t need sleep, I don’t need air to breathe
For me to live your love’s the only thing I ever need

[Chorus:]
And you ain’t never sleeping around right? (Right)
You never treat me like a clown right? (Right)
You ain’t never try to play me
You my daddy I’m your baby
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)
But you gonna always be around right? (Right)
You gonna always help me down right? (Right)
You gonna always really love me
You won’t put no one above me
I’m your queen I got the crown right? (Right)

[Verse 2:]
I look in your eyes there I see what happiness really means
The love we share together makes us sweet as jellybeans
Together forever yes 24 is you and me
Just call us after A ‘cause we will always be
This our love feels so right I know that it can’t be wrong
This how I feel inside nah this just ain’t a song
If they say infinity, I say that it is
They say they couldn’t be alright because we are still going strong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]:
When I look in your eyes there I see all that love should really be
There’s no facade with us, you’re really you I’m really me
I need you more and more each day your going’s a vacancy
There’s nothing on this planet that can take you away from me
You’re forever mine, and I’m forever yours
They should have never said never we gonna weather the storm
We’re like that raven in that poem, we forever more
Our love got different meanings, we a metaphor

[Chorus]
