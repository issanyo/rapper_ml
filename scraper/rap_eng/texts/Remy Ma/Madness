[Intro]

[Hook]
Bitches talking shit when I was gone
See they quiet now that Remy home
Talking tough but they fear me though
All these lil bitches ratchet
Me I really bust my ratchet ask around I really clap it
All these fat transfer implanted bitches all they do is ass clapping
Could of took her little dirty snotty nose kids turned them into bastards
I could of turned her to cabbage
I could of put her in a casket yall prolly mad I'm still rapping
I know yall mad I'm still laughing
I'm the realist bitch after reality tv I'm going to acting

[Verse 1]
Yall know how I give it up I never really gave a fuck
On parole smoking blunts my piffs clean and a cup
See these hoes can't trust him
Hoe fucked your cousin then you went and cuffed it
These niggas digusting these bitches disgusting
I don't want to discuss it
I violate these chicks cause these bitches soft
I spit on the dick then I lick it off
I'm the best of both worlds nigga I'm not the average girl nigga
Throwing shots but you not a killer
These bitches death I don't hear em

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be ignoring hoes don't come for me if I ain't send for you

Motherfuckers forget to remember you
Bitches can't say I try to be friends with you
But you gone make me put a end to you
Trust you dont want smoke with me
Cause you gone go home where you supposed to be
You keep playing I'll smack a hoe
My shit be laying,  a bitch got bundles look how it swinging They call me Rapunzel, Azealia Banks miss 212
