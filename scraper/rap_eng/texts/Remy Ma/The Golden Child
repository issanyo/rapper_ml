[Intro: Papoose]
Yeah, yeah, uh
This for my baby (baby baby)
Golden Child (Golden Child)
Ha-ha (ha-ha)

[Verse 1: Papoose]
It was love at first sight, when I met your mom I was open
While she the queen, I'm supposed to bow
Pretty face with a potent smile
We planned to have you back then but tragedy slowed us down
'Cause she went away for a while when your dad had to hold it down
I questioned God, like "Why is this happenin'?"
You know it's 'bout everything that happen, happen for a reason, I know it now
We argue what we gon' name you, I feel that's over now
It don't matter to me 'cause to me, your name is the Golden Child!
The love we share, they ain't build it, that's why they can't destroy it
Truthfully, I understand the ploy, this is something they can't avoid
I sing to yo' mama stomach, she say, "I am annoyed
"Won't you shut up and just go to sleep, I don't want to hear it, boy!"
She always say I'm annoyin', but she just paranoid
She afraid I'ma spoil you, you loud and she hate to hear the noise
The world is yours and I promise don't gotta share your toys
I won't let you cry unless the tears you cryin' are tears of joy!

[Hook: Papoose & Angelica Villa]
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
They say first comes love and then comes marriage
Never mentioned the devastation of having a miscarriage
I was torn up, broken down, felt less than a woman
But all that pain was erased when the doctor said you was comin'!
Me and daddy were so happy, this is all we ever wanted
So protective of your presence, I was scared to show my stomach
The rumors, had to dub it, said pregnancy's supposed to change you
My belly, your dad would rub it, he was hatin' on my angles
'Cause in pictures, had 'em down pat, from the front it looked all flat
From the side you was pokin' but never could I be called fat
Still fit all my clothes and you had me glowin'
I was overjoyed, ain't care what I was havin', 'cause girl or boy
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
Instantly knew me, you and daddy would never part, please!
All my ladies, listen up
Never think of givin' up
Docs said that we couldn't, but look what God has given us!

I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Take you to school every day, before you eat, say your grace
You can achieve anything; marathon, not a race
Tell the truth, never lie, the limit is in the sky
When you talk to a person, make sure you look in they eye
I'm sorry the world we live in is not a place much better
Sorry that you was born into the Donald Trump era
Thankful that I'm a King, thankful your mom is a Queen
You was born under marriage, black love is supreme
Always respect your elders, say "thank you" and "please"
Your grandmother gon' make you some macaroni and cheese
I tatted you on my arm, some people say it ain't smart
I put you on my left arm 'cause that's mo' close to your heart
I'm excited to meet you, my eyes excited to see you
Your mom got milk in her breasts, she excited to feed you
I would never mislead you, misguide or deceive you
My fists are here to protect you, my mind excited to teach you!

[Hook: Papoose & Angelica Villa]
I heard your heartbeat
I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat

I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!

I heard your heartbeat
I cannot wait to strap you down in that car seat
I heard your heartbeat

I can't wait to make your bottle; I'm you, you are me!
