Mmmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm telling you
Whoa, now

Oh, I was a little girl
A little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees
A little girl
A little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees

A little girl
Little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees
A little girl
A little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees
A little girl

I'm a product of my environment
Nine out of ten of us living
We gonna die in it
Gotta get that bread
So pressure
Yeah, we applying it
And all that bullshit you selling
Nah, we ain't buying it

I'm on my own
A single mother
I'm doing it
I'm in the zone
The music
Yeah, I'm pursuing it

Feeding the family
Yeah that's the reason I'm doing it
Sick and tired of check to check living
The kids are crying

I was a little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees

A little girl
A little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees

A little girl
Little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees

If you always acting gangsta
Then you fake
If you love money too much
Then you a snake

If you go against the grain
You ain't straight
Go against my team
You ain't safe

I'm on my own
A single mother I'm doing it
I'm in the zone
The music
Yeah, I'm pursuing it
Feeding the family
Yeah that's the reason I'm doing it
Sick and tired of check to check living
The kids are crying

Oooh
Yeah, yeah
I'm caught up
It's cause the way I was brought up
No mother, no father
Guess you can say I'm poverty's daughter

My house was not a home
Violence was highly condoned
Nobody gave me shit
So I had to make it on my own

Now I'm filthy rich
But I'm still living on the road
But it's better than being in the pen
Living through the phone

I'm tenement building born
A product of the projects
A real dough getter
Being broke is not an option
If these walls could talk
They tell you the streets is watching

So be careful who you buy from
And cautious of who's copping
Only buy the paper for the horoscopes and comics
I go to the block if I really wanna know what's poppin'

Chicks think it's easy
And they could pass cause they pretty
But you can't pay your mortgage with ass and titties
I smoke trees and I hustle
But that's what I have to do
See, I'm just a girl that got caught up in the avenue

Oooh
Ooh
(Oo oo oooh)
I'm so tired
(Oo oo oooh)
Of living check to check
Being broke all the time, oh
(Oo oo oooh)
There's gotta be something better, yeah
(Oo oo oooh)

A little girl caught up in these streets
Became a victim to the hustlers and trees
