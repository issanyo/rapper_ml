[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
Why would I display the 7 put you a nigga news
When I can spray the desert take a nigga out his shoes
See these niggas mad pussy, and these pussies mad loose
Cuz they been getting fucked and pimped like prostitutes
And still your crew so soft I ain't even gotta shoot
I can punch you in your face, put the footage on Youtube
Whats wrong with you, you ain't part of the crew see
If you ain't the rapper then your a male groupie
(yup yup yup)
The girl so Gucci, the Princess of Pucci
Lately they been calling me Lady Louis
The Vuitton vixen, female Fendi
Shorty Chanel Rodeo Drive Remy
I'm fresh but what you expect
Yes I take cash , credit,  and personal checks
Oh yeah I'm a bastard
When I shop I ask the cashier if she want paper or plastic

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Shesus Khryst tell me who's fucking with me
And if shes so nice tell that bitch to come and get me
The Queen of NY I gets busy
I got a Ace and a 9 and I'm still like (Hit me)
Get me got me
You can't stop me because I'ma go-getter
If you need that snow, then my name cold weather
See I keep that white girl, Christina Aguilera
Whip proper, Betty Crocker (no one can do it better)
No need to argue or debate it
I'm like Floyd you should appreciate me sparring with these haters
You ain't never been the best, and you far from the greatest
You like Mayweather father , you swear to God that you made us
I read the website pages and they saying I'm the illest bitch
You look like a puppet and you need a ventriloquist
These females are fans, these guys are groupies
So I'ma let you star in your own movie
Then I'ma (shoot at you actors like movie directors)
