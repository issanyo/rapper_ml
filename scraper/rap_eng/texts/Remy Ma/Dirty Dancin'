Put your drink in the air for the queen LY
Put your drink in the air for the chick Remy Ma
Put your drink in the air if you know she nice
Put your drink in the air for Shesus Khryst
I got my drink and my two-step
My drink and my two-step
I got my drink and my two-step
My drink and my two-step
It's on, it's on, it's on
I'm home, get the patron
And tell them that it's on
Yeah, please believe it
R to the easy
Can't leave rap alone, the game easy

[Verse]
Can't come to the phone coz I'm sleepin'
Shawty came over and spent the night
On his knees going down, down baby
Down just like a rollercoaster
[?], baby, right hand, my shoulder holster
Y'all got little congestion
Go shimmy, shimmy - pow
I got big guns
My shit like click, click - pow
They got little Rem now
I'm like "yeah, look at me"
Straight stuntin' just like my daddy
I got a little fatty and some big ass titties
Even got [?] in my face and I'm still mad pretty
And these bitches can't catch me
So these bitches mad at me
So I smile in all my pictures
Yeah, I'm mad happy
I heard that you said that when you see me
That you was gon smack me
Yeah bitch, I'm laughin'
This is blowing out of proportion, don't gas it
This bitch out of her mind, and she plastic
This bitch barely can rhyme, and she garbage
I'm convinced I'm the last bitch standin'
And they can't stand it, that's why I can't stand shit
Shesus Khryst mixtape, you hope you got bandage
You prolly [?] get remanded
Yeah bitch, I'm laughin'
You sittin' at home alone and you spazzin'
I'm sittin' on your man, facing, he's gaggin'
I'm talking like he can't breathe coz I'm black
And back and forth, and forth and back
Better pull his head out for a second
Coz he's gaspin'
Then I shove it right back in
Meanwhile I'm still trying to figure out what happened
Yeah bitch, I'm laughin'
Got hoes and jokes, now y'all real frenzy
Y'all hoes is broke, don't got no money
And ya man's a bum, so don't even ask him
Yeah bitch, I'm laughin'

[Hook]
I got my drink and my two-step
My drink and my two-step
I got my drink and my two-step
My drink and my two-step
It's on, it's on, it's on
I'm home, get the patron
And tell them that it's on
Yeah, please believe it
R to the easy
Can't leave rap alone, the game easy
