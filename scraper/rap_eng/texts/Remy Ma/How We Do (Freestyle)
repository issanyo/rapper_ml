[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
I be's the hottest bitch on the market nigga
Remy Martin from BX to Compton nigga
And if you see Game tell em it's not a game
Cause every nigga ever fucked me is pussy whipped something crazy
True story you'll be all on me like damn she a certified shawty
Oh yeah boogie down my city
Pretty Remy have em sick when they see my titties
Plus my lips like (uh),  my hips like (uh)
My ass like (nah) you gets none
Pussy niggas is too scared yall really need to run
I know they told you to get a dog but you need to get a gun
I was never a motherfucker, I'm really into sons
Brothers, fathers, uncles and husbands
And every and then I might be do a cousin
I'm a nigga magnet to attract em it's nothing
I left the factory I was on the 645
Ain't a need for wooden doors when a bitch this fly
Got cut in my face and I'm still a dime
Have a nigga on parole in my room getting high
If you wine me, dine me, and buy me diamonds
I'll give it you , just how you like it boy
And my shit stay wet , how much you wanna bet
I'm as real as it gets
They say I fucked up cause I wrapped Luck up
Them rap hoes do not want me around
Because I spits it, and when I spits it
All they rhymes gone get shut the fuck down
They say my LP flopped and my whole team wack
And I only blew up because of Lean Back
But I'm like fuck you because my G's stack
Plus my whole squad killers and you can believe dat
Nigga!
