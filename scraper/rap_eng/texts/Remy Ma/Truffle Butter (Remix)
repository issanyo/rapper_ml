[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Thinking out loud
Yall know I got the 4-fizzy on me right now
People keep saying ,"Rem you need to drop a record"
I'm like in a minute let me body bitches records
Yea, for the millions I will kill these pop hoes
Ain't no one in these streets like me and potholes
Bout to put yall all out of business, shop closed
And since I dropped Hot Bitch all these chicks den got cold
I'm around wassup?, I don't care right now
Five 40-inch bundles in my hair right now
Whoa, do you feel me?
I'm a real one fake ones fear me
I might fly out to your hood if they clear me
Ain't met a rapper chick yet that ain't scared of me
You talk tough but I really did a sentence
In black ink , your fingers never been printed
Showing black love post, I invented
You be dragging it ma, I'm authentic

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Yo, eat em like chow
Like Nas said in Ether "yall love my style"
But niggas in the streets and the niggas locked down
Ever need a shooter, they got me on speed dial
Makaveli still here, ain't a killer but don't push me
Violate em like parole
They let me out the pen (Why?)
To put them bitches in the coffin
Cuz she a lil ho, black eyes like a raccoon
Knockout, leave her snoring
Leave ya head full of blood, girl
You should join a rap group
Cause as a soloist you boring
I'm a female God, on my Wu-Tang cash rules
Yall hoes is retarded, live wire no shortage
She'll be smokin' crack soon
Bitches loving me like sausage, hottest chick on the market
I'm the hardest smartest goddess regardless
Walk with revolvers, you pressing charges
Born in the projects, with the cops & robbers
In the Bronx we bombers, Remy Mafia mobbin'
You know
