[Hook (Ron Browz)]
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to fuck me [4x]

[Verse 1: Ron Browz]
She be looking right around my waist
Ask me how I'm doing, "I'm ok"
I'll go to any club, I don't bang
But you don't want no problems today papi
She thought I was gon' violate
Thought I was cheating, she was climbing up the fire escape
Tried to catch me with my pants down
She let me beat it, I'm the man now

[Hook 2 (Remy Ma)]
He said that he don't like me
But every night he called me
Said he want to fuck me [4x]

[Verse 2: Remy Ma)
He be getting money in the town
Ask me where I'm at, I'm around
He call me the Queen, I got a crown
Everywhere I go, I shut it down
He thought I tried to line him
Thought I was leaving, poked a hole in the condom
Tried to show me he was serious
He tried to eat it on my period

[Hook 3 (Ron Browz)]
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to love me
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to fuck me
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to fuck me
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to fuck me

[Verse 3: Ron Browz]
I be browsing in the pussy
Matter of fact, I be saucing in the pussy
Imma' ring her in the pussy
Know a nigga pull the ring out for the pussy
I be solo in the pussy
Matter of fact I throw adobo on the pussy
I be seasoning the pussy
Go to sleep and start dreaming in the pussy

[Hook (Ron Browz)]
She said that she don't like me
But every night she call me
Say she want to fuck me [4x]
