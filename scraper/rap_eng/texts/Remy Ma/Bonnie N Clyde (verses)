[Verse 1: Remy Martin]
See I be on some other shit
Like fuck your dead mother shit
Disrespect ya whole character
Call you by your government
I dont know what these bitches think
You ugly and ya pussy stink
Ya whole flow is borrowed
Stole everything but the kitchen sink
See you just mad bitch
And you suck mad dick
My shit is fire I does my own adlib
With no practice
I spits backwards backwards I spits
I practice; no atlas
And niggas should call you frying pan
Your face is like a frying pan
And niggas throw they meat in you
You burn em like a frying pan
I ain't lying man
See yall dont really want it
I got these Bitches Scared To Death
They Know The Album Coming

Yeap See Slate
This Is Why I Told You
I Can Not Do Mixedtapes
I Just Be Talkin Fuckin Reckless
Its Crazy

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
And I Ain't Gotta Force It
My Shit Come Natural
You Dont Want Me On Every Mixtape
As If I Was Papoose
Exposing All Your Skeletons
Straight Getting  At you
Tellin Everybody Imma Fuck You Up
When I Catch You
No What Im Talkin Bout
Im What A Thug About
Tella Nigga Im Frontin So The Squad Can Slut em' Out
My Brand New Whips And Gut Em Out
Then Come Back With Some Different Shit
Lookin Like Its It But Just Pimp My Shit

Yall Bitches Need To Step Ya Rap Game Up Immediately

Im Talkin Like Fuckin Last Year Like Last Decade
(Hahahahaha)
