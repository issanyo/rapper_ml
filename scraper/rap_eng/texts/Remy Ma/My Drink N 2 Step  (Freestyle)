(Chorus)
Put ya drink in the air for the Queen of NY
Put ya drink in the air for that chick Remy Ma
Put ya drink in the air if you know she nice
Put ya drink in the air for Shesus Christ
I got my drink n my 2 step , my drink n my 2 step
I got my drink n my 2 step , my drink n my 2 step
It's on , it's on , it's on and I'm home
Get the Patron and tell em that its on!

[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
Yeah
Please believe it R to E-z
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't come to the phone cause I'm sleeping
Shorty came over and spent the night on his knees
Going down down baby , down just like a rollercoaster
Keep heat baby right here in my shoulder holster
Yall got little guns yall shit go chimmy chimmy pow
I got big guns my shit like click click pow
They like look at Remy now, I'm like yeah look at me
Straight stunting just like my daddy
I gotta little fatty and some big ass titties
Even got cut in my face and I'm still mad pretty
And these bitches can't catch me so these bitches mad at me
So I smile in all my pictures
Yeah I'm mad happy
I heard you said when you see me that you was gone smack me
Yeah bitch I'm laughing
This is blown out of proportion don't gas it
This bitch out of her mind and she plastic
This bitch barely can rhyme and she bad bitch
I'm convinced I'm the last bitch standing
And they can't stand it, thats why I can't stand chicks
Shesus Khryst mixtape you hoped it got banned
You probably hope I go to court and get remanded
Yeah bitch I'm laughing
You sittin at home alone and you spazzing
I'm sitting on your man face and he gagging
I'm talking like he can't breath cuz I'm blacking
Back and forth, and forth and back and
Let him pull his head out for a second cuz he gasping
Then I shove it right back in
Meanwhile , you still tryna figure out what happen
Yeah bitch I'm laughing
Yall hoes is jokes now yall real funny
See yall hoes is broke don't got no money
And ya mans a bum , see don't even ask him
Yeah bitch I'm laughin'

(Chorus)

[Outro]
Please believe it R to E-z
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
