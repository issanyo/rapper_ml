[Hook 1: Papoose (Remy Ma)]
She says she love my nature
She don't love me, she love my gangsta
She don't love me, she love my paper
Caught me creepin with the next door neighbor
It wasn't me (If it was, it was)
She'll still love me, cause love is love

[Hook 2: Remy Ma (Papoose)]
He said he love my body
He don't love me, he love my punanny
I'm in love with the things that he buy me
Caught me with the next nigga in the lobby
It wasn't me, (If it was, it was)
He'll still love me, cause love is love

[Bridge: Papoose (Remy Ma)]
Now what's my name? (Daddy)
What's my name? (Daddy)

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
And I still love him even when I'm aggy
He has me wrapped around his finger
And in my cell phone, he got his own ringer
Now, sometimes he get heated
And I know he don't mean it
But as much as he accused me
I should have cheated
And even if I cheated, he wouldn't believe it
Cause right after I read it, messages gets deleted
And I know we even but, I don't never see it
When I step on the scene, the groupies gotta beat it
He caught, it's cool, but we break up
New bag, new shoes, and we make up
He buy me diamonds, that's my darling
Guess I really believe that he sorry
As far as I can see, he called for me
How could I not accept his apology

[Bridge: Remy Ma (Papoose)]
Now what's my name? (Baby)
What's my name? (Baby)

[Verse 2: Papoose]
And once I get it, I'm gone, I'm Swayze
I do the damn thang and I run
I knew she was a freak, cause she had an earring in her tongue
Cop a whip, I cop rims, I'm not those dudes
How you gonna buy a suit and don't cop no shoes
Put the sugarfoot inside her stomach
Man I have her climbing up the wall like Spider-Woman
She gon' ride through the hood on back of the motorcycle
Sexy, she got more thighs than the Bible
Can't tell a woman you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love, you gotta prove it
A man give you his trust, you can't abuse it
Annalyze your choice before you choosin'
Ask Snoop Dogg, I let it bang
I got the hardest chick in the game screaming my name
