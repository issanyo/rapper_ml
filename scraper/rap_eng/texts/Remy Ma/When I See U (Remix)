Everybodi's likes he's no item
Plz don't like em
He dont wife em
He one nights em
N I value my friends opinions I don't wanna fight them
But I'm really fe3ling that this one is the right one
You always on my mind when the night comes
So I leave a key under the door mat just incase you might come
Staring at my window
Picture on my wall
Phone on my pillow so I hear it if you call
If you saw how I be's when I se3 you
Babi I even be blushing when I leave you
Its sumthing bout my bodi being next to you
So sexci boi
You sexci boi
You make me shy
N might get nervous
If you know it I think you staring at my eyes on purpose wish on a sign hoping it to come true
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue
[B.G]
You don't believe when I tell you that I need you
I get this tingeling in my body when I see you
I get upset when I call and can't reach you
It anit nothin i want to, to please you
To see you always smiling back
I anit copy that benz or the dimiond ring
We can take us a trip jus you and me
Get a pin house 4 week long (miami beach)
Have fun hit the water on the jet skies
The leartard saying jus sex me
Come show your boy love
Give a gangstar a hug
Clearly ain't nothin missing a thug
Oh yes I miss you
Got you a gift to
Open your legs baby girl I wanna kiss you
Everything about you I adour
Your the first I want to see when I get off ???
[Fantasia]
I Put Your Picture On My Mirror
Start To Blush When Somebody Say's Your Name
In My Stomach Theirs A Pain
See You Walk In My Direction I Go The Other Way
I Start To Stutter When I Speak
Try To Stand But My Knee's Go Weak
What Happening To Me In The Dark Can You Tell Me What It Means
I Lay My Head On My Pillow
Staring Out The Window
Wish On A Star For A Sign
Its The Reason Why
Your Always On My Mind
When You Come Around I get Shy
When I See You, When I See You
Never No When You Might Walk By
So I Gotta Be Right On Time
When I See You When I See You
[Young Jeezy]

Truth is ima call you later
Im on the grind right now trying to get this paper
Im in this streats all day im just trying to eat
Your in the bed all night you just trying to sleep

It Is What Is, Baby Wipe Me Down (Yeah)
Think back how it was with out me
And How Everything Is So Thug About Me said
[Fantasia]
Your Always On My Mind
When You Come Around I'm Shy
When I See You, When I See You
Never No When You Might Walk By
So I Gotta Be Right On Time
When I See You When I See You
[REMY MA]
Sumthing Now Is Taking Over Me N I Don't Know How
But I Gotta Be On Time When Ever You Come Around
Ask Me When I'm Coming
I'm Coming Right Now
I Think Bout Chu Whenever I Go To Mr. Charles
Got A Pen N A Napkin
Writing Our Names Down
My First Name
Wit Cha Last Name
I Know We Not Married But I'm Practicing

Wish On A star for a Sign Hopeing It Come True
I Wonder If You Know Or Do You Have A Clue
