[Intro:]
I’m around, I’m around [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I’m the queen I got a crown hoe
I wet bitches I try to drown hoes
This is punisher , I ground hoes
I don’t play that , Homey the clown hoes
She a deuce ,She got chopped up
These pussies loose , She got fucked up
You act bougie You get stuck up
I’m about a dolla , You get bucked up

[Chorus:]
It’s going down, I’m around
Just touch the sound, I’m around
Where my crown, I’m around
I’m around motherfucker, I’m around
Money I’m around
Guns I’m around
Cars I’m around
Drugs I’m around
I’m around
Tell them niggas I’m around
I’m around
Tell them bitches I’m around

[Verse 2:]
You a bug ,I’m so flee
I give you some, I’m so me
That went over your head , I  OD
I’m Bobby Johnson , I’m a OG
I hit my 40 ounce , It’s OE
I got thick hair , A whole heap
Whole scared , Y’all got cold feet
Your run is over ,You a slow leak

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I’m a felon , My gun goes off
I burn bitches , I’m a blowtorch
I cancel bitches , I’m a showoff
I’m too hard ,I got blue balls
I told greasy, My mouth too slick
I’m on fire , The girl fuse lit
, I’m a bitch I’m a blue pick
I throw it up ,Bitches you sick
[Chorus]
