If she ain't the chick in the mirror she can't out spit me
See dudes see this ass and they think I'm 'gon fornicate
Christmas tree niggas leave 'em hangin like they ornaments
I have 'em order rims, import 'em in
No loiterin, straight origin
Miss flirtatious part mercedes

[Verse Two: Remy Ma]
I'm the soul controller
G.I. Joe, ho I control the soldiers
Float like Noah, and I toat for stolers
Leave the nappyhead ho with a comb and a coma
Go console her, yo leave this ho supposed to be
Stylin like me with them posters posted
Know you showed her, I just hold composure
Suck my teeth and sound like an open soda
.....Body like a Coca-Cola
But I quench a nigga thirst like cold Corona
Rode your toaster, I got the coldest shoulder
But I keep my heat warm with my shoulder holder
Coast to coaster, I pays no payolla
And I never do a show, for a broke promoter
Walk in the Queen's kingdom and overthrow her
I'm a first class bitch I ain't got time to coach her

[Hook: Ayanna Irish]

[Verse Three: Hedonis Da Amazon]
The Philly swagger they diggin ya Philly auror
To the O.G.'s I'm Oprah, to the young girls I'm Dorah
I walks, with a glide my talk be 'bout money
Broke niggas always askin why I sound so funny
Huh, communication's key, he never moved a key
He never drove the V, who he talkin to me?
Usin a pick up line by Jay-Z
I'm far from a dummy chick he loadin up his dummy clips
I'm like next, bein broke ain't a protocol
My ears be chandeliers, my chain like a waterfall
My ass like a backyard, heh heh!!!
You never seen a crib steppin out of a car
Let that lightnin bug out of that jar, try to bottle the light
Let it roll like a kite, wind blows catch flies
I'm catchin flights from The U.K. back to U.S.A
My number rings say F-U-C-K

[Hook: Ayanna Irish]
I know you like my style, and I see you checkin us out
