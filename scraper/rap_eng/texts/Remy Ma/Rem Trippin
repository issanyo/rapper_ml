[Intro]
Y'all know this my type of shit right?
Remy Ma

[Chorus]
Smack you in your face lil bitch, I'll knock your weave out
Frontin' like that’s your hair and I see the leave out
Rock a Pucci coat, Louis boots, and Gucci pouch
Fashion Nova jeans, wife beater, and my titties out
Smack you in your face lil bitch, I'll knock your weave out
Frontin' like that’s your hair and I see the leave out
Rock a Pucci coat, Louis boots, and Gucci pouch
Fashion Nova jeans, wife beater, and my titties out

[Verse]
I’m so different from you bitches
Look good in real life, you look good in pictures
Got my own money but I still get his
Got sidechick pussy with wife privileges
I post on the Gram and she be sick
But I don’t want your man, I just need dick
Maybe a bag or two, fuck the bullshit
Perhaps a lil sloppy toppy with his full lips
Mommy’s home, now they all dubs
It’s on sight, stay away from all clubs
Said Mommy’s home, now they all dubs
It’s on sight, you should stay away from all clubs
I’m a real bitch and they all fake, the hood feel me
They fuck with Remy, yeah the long way
Its litty, I run the city, I hear that all day
Sitting pretty, I’m booking busy, that’s what they all say
She mad, her friend mad, I’m pickin' up bags
Your money low, it's coming slow, they switching up fast
Snatch your wig, now she sick, need a urologist
You was cold, now you cold, yeah you fucking bricked

[Chorus]
Smack you in your face lil bitch, I'll knock your weave out
Frontin' like that’s your hair and I see the leave out
Rock a Pucci coat, Louis boots, and Gucci pouch
Fashion Nova jeans, wife beater, and my titties out
Smack you in your face lil bitch, I'll knock your weave out
Frontin' like that’s your hair and I see the leave out
Rock a Pucci coat, Louis boots, and Gucci pouch
Fashion Nova jeans, wife beater, and my titties out
