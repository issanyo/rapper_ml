[Intro]
Like seriously this shit is getting out of fucking control
Let another fucking nigga make a fucking song for these strip ass bitches
Get money nigga!

(Chorus)
Fuck the weatherman with that desert I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that AK I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that Uzi I make it rain on em
And hurricane on em, and leave his brain
Fuck the weatherman with that desert I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that AK I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that Uzi I make it rain on em

[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
I'm like damn it's about to be summer again
How the fuck these niggas still tryna  make it rain?
Running round with these cowards talking love is pain
That's exactly why I had to roof that TS chain

I got that Remy Ma chain crazy ,pink and white bling crazy
Earrings, bracelet, anklet, bling crazy
I ain't change been crazy, Niggas ain't been claiming
They know its the God honest gospel truth if Rem say it

A year later still singing the same gingo, no ring on your wedding finger
Where the fuck is your second single?
And yall know how Rem do I be greasy rapping
And now I'm tryna see what happen you dont see me laughing

I'm Remy straight , no need to gas it
You Henny and Alize, ya fucking Thug Passion
Matter fact all yall niggas straight faggots
Type to let your chick stick her fingers in your ass

She be sucking your dick, you nut in her mouth
And then she give you a kiss, then spit it back out
You fucking homo , I asked your man if you pop off
He put his hand up, shook it  a little and said so-so

I fuck with that D, dat white, and that coco
You be fucking with Ice-T and his wife Coco
So all that shit about how your gun go
Really don't matter cause the last few events you was a no show

This don't make no sense, Rem ain't go no sense
I'm spittin that 08, you still kickin that 06
If you dont want beef you should keep it gravy
Cause I'll have this shit poppin all crazy
Smack fire out the face of yo baby
With no , if's, and's, or but's cop the maybe
NIGGA!

[Outro]
It's the Queen of NY , Remy Ma aka The BX Savior aka Shesus Khryst

(Chorus)
Fuck the weatherman with that desert I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that AK I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that Uzi I make it rain on em
And hurricane on em, and leave his brain
Fuck the weatherman with that desert I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that AK I make it rain
Fuck the weatherman with that Uzi I make it rain on em
