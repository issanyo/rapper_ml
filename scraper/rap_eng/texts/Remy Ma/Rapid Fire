[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
Now the girl was gone but I came back
When I came back, came back in a brand new baby blue blue Maybach
Terror Squad the squad and we don't play that
Remy Ma, bad bitch I know you hate that
Can't take that I state facts, I guess thats why cats be grillin
Got dro, got dough,got fly clothes, got condos, got dam we chillin
Now BET wanna know how we living, and MTV wanna film my cribs
No kiddin, go get it, We kilt it admit it we be's the shit
Yall can't believe that we did it right?
Ain't think we get it right?
You hear the change in the flow when I spit it
Like yall niggas ain't ready its really heavy its Remy
[?]
I'm smokin spaghetti and thats why people forgettin that
Cats pussy, push me and you gone get it
Got diamonds embedded in the front and back of my pendant
Dont mean to hurt you boo its reversible
So you can flip and flop it
I got the sickest watches, Watch it my ice nice and the band is Ostrich
I got kicks that ain't never even left the box
It's so crisp, ask Pap he be licking the bottom
You dont got em, can't get em
Watch how I match the fitted
I stay on my job so I can give yall the business
My tits is the biggest, Hips the thickest
You try to diss us, I'ma make sure you that you little niggas swim with the fishes
