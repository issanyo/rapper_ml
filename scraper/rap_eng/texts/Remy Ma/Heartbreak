[Verse 1: Fat Joe with The-Dream]
You should leave the house for a moment
Lately, I can't help but to notice (Focus)
That he don't acknowledge you
Nah, he don't be out with you
I get it, I get it, where I'm from we on that bullshit
Yeah you love that bullshit
Real shit, I can't even lie to you
But you gotta walk for me
You said you've got friends, saving them up for me
I'm out of time, you know it gets hard for me
I gotta respond, the money keep calling me
You know it be calling me

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Now I can't prove my love
Heartbreak 101
And you stay here in my arms until the song's done
They say nothing lasts forever, but forever's always wrong
Now we're in that moment where you wanna do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Come boy, you know that I'm wit it
Yeah, anything you want, you know that I'll get it
Cuz I'ma get it girl, you get it boy
I'm a city girl, let's leave the country for a minute
Let's go, pack up the bags now
Let's go to Tokyo
Let's go to Paris, yeah
Let's go to Rome
I'm so all insecure, I can't contain it now
His love good, but your love's the best
And it only gets better so let's not forget
Want me out of my clothes and turn the lights down
I wanna give it to you, I'm talking right now
Do you got a pillow, I need to bite down
I ain't ready to go, I'm spending nights now
You know I know that you wanna give me your love now
And I know you know that I wanna give it back

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Now I can't prove my love
Heartbreak 101
At least stay here in my arms until the song's done
They say nothing lasts forever, but forever's always wrong
Now we're in that moment where you wanna do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na

[Bridge: Fat Joe]
We at the Pablo show in the Kardashian row
With the Kardashians sipping the Kardashian show
We at the Pablo show, minks down to the floor
Got six bad bitches in the back of the row
We at the Pablo show
We at the Pablo show
The father's back

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Now I can't prove my love
Heartbreak 101
At least stay here in my arms until the song's done
They say nothing lasts forever, but forever's always wrong
Now we're in that moment where you wanna do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na
Do anything but go home
Na na na na

[Outro: The-Dream]
I wanna be with you baby, I wanna
That's why I'm tryna leave with you, baby
See I wanna be with you, baby
That's why I'm tryna leave with you, baby
I wanna be with you, baby
That's why I'm tryna leave with you, baby
I wanna be with you, baby
That's why I'm tryna leave with you, baby
