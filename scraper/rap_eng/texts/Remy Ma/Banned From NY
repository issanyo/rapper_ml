[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Mic check 1-2 , 1-2
In school I walked the halls with a sharp pencil
Now I'm drawing a pistol, let a nigga do a bitch move
Or let a bitch move I'm shitting
Wiping my ass with em like tissue
And then I gotta flush em see Remy really don't love em
Same shit different toilet, so like a plum I'd hate to plunge her
And If a nigga got some trees and a nice piece of lumber
And could make some paper than I might just fuck him
And If I stick em , than  I stuck em
Like a chicken I'll pluck em
Gave him some scrambled eggs
Now he walking so I duck him
Niggas got bubblegum blow
Pop broads like Rem some sorta sucker
Put some money on that bitch and I bet you I Lady Luck her
If she want a problem , cause a uproar or a ruckus
It's never nothing for me to quickly Timberland chuck her
Dead in the middle of ground zero
I'm like a Superhero, female Joe Pesci, Al Pacino modern day Robert De Niro
Defend my niggas that do murders like Robert Shapiro
Drink Malibu, pineapple juice and puff piff by the pillow
Forreal tho, Tell my flow ain't so crazy
Just shot at yo crib
Not where you live but where you lay yo baby
And lately I been spittin on some I'm real yo Conceited shit
To me chicks is like dicks
I'm quick to tell em beat it bitch
You hang around boxers, but your no tough cookie
You only get hard when your around pussies
I do chick greasy K Sleazy know my M.O
Why you runnin round like  please, please listen to my demo
I'm in a new MB bitch and I'm buggin at the windows
With the tints, limo black cause I'm blowing down the Indo
You may stunt round them other broads
But you don't want it with Rem tho
Take your posters down on some petty shit like my nigga N-O
I ain't saying that you garbage
You better stuck where you started
You could neva ever ever ever be Ms.Martin
I flow retarded, You can't stand to see me
I know you was wishing I was really banned from TV
That still wouldn't stop me from talking reckless on mixtapes, and CD's FM, XM, Satellite, and DVD
I'm remarkable it don't matter who I'm talking to
They all flow mediocre and they faces ain't marketable
Look ma you need more than some shades and some shiny lips
For me to believe you a rapper, and you really can spit
That you even next to me, Do yall hear this bitch?
I wish I was Foxy right now I don't wanna hear this shit
You need to fuck back, I know you been sneaking round back
You and your weave is loose I can see your tracks
You ain't fire , no bitch you ain't poppin
You a burning sanitation truck, ma you hot garbage
You a bum bitch, you hear the trumpets
It's the Queen of NY, Remy Ma
And I ain't nothing to fuck with
Rem!
