[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
Keep coming with the same lines
Everything but the truth
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
So know I’m not the one for the bullshit
I empty out the closet like a full clip
You tried so hard to get at me
I wish you would’ve left me when you met me
Whole squad said you was a hoe though
Let breezy know these niggas ain’t loyal
Blowin’ up my phone turn my phone off
Can’t take no bitch nigga phone call

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
Keep coming with the same lines
Everything but the truth
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
You picked the wrong one, now you pick the right one
Got no love left and I ain't even tryna fight dumb
You keep your birds cause I’m gone when my flight come
You know what you did and honestly I been type done
How you getting hoes take 'em home then you wife them
It’s really no comparison cause I ain't nothing like them
Bestie said fuck him, I’m like don’t get me hype cause
At one point would had been gun point on site bum
Now I look at it like owww, that something light hun
I’m happy that its over yeah you only had a slight run
I can be a fowl bitch fuck your whole life up
I might spend the night with your bro out of spite cause you a fuck nigga

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
Keep coming in with the same lines
Everything but the truth
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby

[Verse 3: French Montana]
You know these hoes ain't loyal
Mama always told me these hoes ain't for you
That’s why we never mix like water with the oil
Baby keep the pussy mine, and ima keep ya spoiled
(And you know)
Real one hold you down like a real army
But I picked the wrong one like Steve Harvey
Same boss boat dock for 8 days
But you a thot selling box on the back page
Sitting, reminiscing, way before I started tripping
About what he said and she said
But I ain't having it, your game weak like seven nights
Coming with the same lines like Trump's wife

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
Keep coming with the same lines
Everything but the truth
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You just played me for the last time
I’m done fucking with you
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
You picked the wrong one, yea yea
You picked the wrong one baby
The wrong one
The wrong one
You know you picked the wrong one
