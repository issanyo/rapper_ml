I don't care enough to lie and that's the truth
I could get you shot I don't have to shoot
Whether off the top or in the booth 100 proof
Remy Ma, Absolut, yeah obsolete
None of yall hot to me
I hear yall talking but I know its not to me
To one of them , other bitches it got to be
Cuz if a chick say Rem she gone swallow teeth
They say I'm losing weight, I should probably eat
Well then feed me rappers or feed me beats
The term female rapper dont apply to me
I'm the Queen and this is chess they playing hide-n-seek
Like seriously where do these chicks be?
It's been over 5 years and still no CD
No feature , remix, or mixtape
Not even a guest appearance or
No DVD, I never seen you on the panel
No radio stations, no TV channels, no cable, satellite
No XM, even your Facebook page ain't got no friends
I dont know who hyped you
You don't really wanna fight boo
But your not hot and nobody likes you
Its to the point now they dont even care if you droppin
It's Remy Ma yeah yeah , and I'm so poppin
