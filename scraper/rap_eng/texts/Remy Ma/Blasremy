[Intro]
Here ye, here ye all rise
The Queen of NY
Remy Ma
The BX Savior
Shesus Khryst

(Chorus)
I'm the best none before
None should come after me
Talking against Rem now that's blasremy
I'm the best none before none should come after me
Talking against Rem, now that's Blasphemy

[Verse 1: Remy]
It's like I caught a case now these little bitches wanna dumb up
Think I was Fendi the way these little bitches wanna come up
They mad cuz I'm a ten and I'm getting Dinero
I ain't deep freeze but I know these hoes  Sub-zero
P-p-pussies is loose I wanna let my niggas loose
But I already know that these rappers is pussy
It ain't Houstoun fire crotch
Baldheaded bitch better mind her fucking business (whoeva)
Niggas is rats and these bitches is mouses
Matter fact shout out to all my bitches in the pink houses
I be in the studio writing puffin' on trees
Yall be in precinct, crying talking to the D
So please it's me bitches Shesus Christ
It's Blasremy, saying she's this nice so keep advice back when they'll leave her alone
I'm like the stadium in Katrina I ain't got all of my dome
So how the fuck you think you get me mad by calling my phone
When I answer it and let you hear ya man fucking and moaning
It's 5 in the morning , don't you got somewhere to be going?
Some type of J-O-B or place of appointment?
Bitch

(Chorus) x2

[Verse 2]
This bitch is annoying matter fact bitch this a warning
Next bitch talk shit gone be kissing my Jordans
I does whatever the fuck I li-zike and yall be kissing ass
Cuz all yall bitches is di-zikes and yall dont wanna fi-zight
I come thru on a bi-zike
My swag so up it got all yall bitches ti-zight
How the fuck she tell's Rem  that she gets it in?
That every time
She a sucka fucker  fuck her I'm thugger thugga
Go head and act crazy  like you really wanna, wanna get fucked up right in front of your son and your daughter
Somebody better call her, cause I'm about to smack her
And I dont wanna have to
But I keep reminding these bitches that I am not a rapper
And I am not actor but my life is like a movie
And I wrap yall bitches up just like yall bitches was a doobie

(Chorus)
