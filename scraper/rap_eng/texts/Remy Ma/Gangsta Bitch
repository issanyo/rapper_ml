[Hook](x2)
You ain't never hear me snitch
I live the code of the street, I'm a gangster bitch
I hold my own, I hold my own
Hold my own, I hold my own

[Verse 1]
I like my beat down low
Top back in my whip
I got my hate up lockers on just to puff in my pip
The truth is we selling me or Remy, you that bitch
And I be high
I roll the windows down like yeah, yeah I know that shit
Only fuck with gangster niggas cause I'm a gangster bitch
And Remy Ma is straight cash, you gotta check your shit
You pussy
I get you robbed, even though I'm rich
I'm disrespectful, tell your mom yous' a son of a bitch
I'm a international hustler, if you want it I got it
I'm talking import, export, my passport is poppin'
But I'm cautious of who's coppin'
Cause I don't mean that pretty bitches is fallin' when I be sayin' [?] is, drop it
Nigga

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2]
I do my dirt all by my [?], why you bastards hatin'
I hold my own like I'm masturbatin'
And no, I don't have a statement, no
I'm not signing my name on no [?]
No accusations or allegations, no
I can't help with the applications, no
I don't have any information
And y'all can label me as uncooperative
Rats in the garden and the apple is rottin'
See the avenues is listening, the streets is watchin'
But I live by the code and I'mma die by the code
And can't nobody say that Remy ever told me nothin'

[Hook](x2)

[Bridge]

Put your motherfuckin' guns in the air
Yeah and if you'll split, you a nigga cause he snitched on you nigga
Put your motherfuckin' guns in the air
Yeah and if you stab, you a nigga, cause he [?] on you nigga
Put your motherfuckin' guns in the air
Yeah and if you kill, you a nigga, cause he squealed on you nigga
Put your motherfuckin' guns in the air
I'm a gangster bitch
