Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
Its whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva, whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva
See if the God say get her imma get her
Ill have her wit a pillow where the casket won't fit her
The only reason I hit her was she kept talkin greasy
Lil jump skeezy betta ask somebody who I be
See Im R to tha Ez, its mid-summer got on long sleeves cause my arms stay freezin
I gets fly for no reason, see I got money but its always robbin season
See hip hop needs me, the beats is Swizz, the girl is sick and please believe, that imma start, see every damn night I ball ? is blue and grey like Seton Hall
Chorus
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
Its whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva, whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva
Yea see Rem is a monster, Im raps MVP the star on the roster
Officially a boogie-down Bronxer, Terror Squad ain't the Brady Bunch and I ain't Marcia
My shits so butter they should call me Marge
And I ain't gotta be boss just as long as Im in charge
And whateva I say goes, so if I say NO, dont ask why just assume its because I say SO
Ive been doin it too long, ain't nothin ? me, Ill run through ur lil gated community
You know how the girl be, Im a show stopper, Ill give it to you early before the toast pops up
Chorus
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
Its whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva, whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva
See this goes out to my Bx crew, put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Fuck em all day, fuck em all night, treat niggas like hoes
Its whateva like a four long blaze, and Im hotter then hoes that work at the Days Inn
People tryin to make shit to make niggas bop, I make shit they play that get niggas shot
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Right hand got a blunt, left hand got a cup
And you already know the rules dont apply to us
We gon do what we do, its whateva 2 fuck
We got the fly shit here we go, drivin backwards down the one like Big in the hypnotized video
Bang this in your stereo, turn it higher, now everybody light your lighters
Chorus
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, Put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
Its whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva, whateva, whateva, whateva, its whateva
