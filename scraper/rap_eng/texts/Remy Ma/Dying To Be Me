[Chorus]
I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

[Verse 1]
Hair done, brows waxed
Lashes laced, lips MAC'd
Nails nice, toes match
My clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, shoes from Saks
Now the bag is dope, the jewels is crack
And I pulled up in the what-the-fuck-is-that?
And this pretty face really don't help
It's practically masturbation the way I'm feelin' myself
And I'm not alone, nah, the dudes be on me
I mean when I'm regular in my Abercrombies
Tank top, flip flops, no makeup, hardly
They still can tell I got a body-ody
I don't need no friends, I'm a one-bitch army
They say I'm a ton of fun, like a walkin' party
This is my prerogative like my name was Bobby
Dial 646 that bitch, you wanna call me

[Chorus]
I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

[Verse 2]
I'm pretty, attitude shitty
Do I think about  care these hoes? Not really
I mean really, I kinda understand
No one likes the bitch that's fuckin' their man
But damn I got swag and he's into fashion
He said I be killin 'em, fatal attraction
I'm a 1 + 9, call me MAC 10
You a 5, I'ma call you Jackson
They say I talk mad shit, that's a fact
But ain't none of these bum bitches smack me yet
I be so lit, cute as ever
I go all the places you could never
My bag say GG or CC
Some say MJ or CD
A few got MK or LV
Your bag say H&M or AMP

[Chorus]
I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me

[Bridge]
I'm sittin' in the drop that look like cotton candy
That's probably why they say they can't stand me
Their man be all in me every time we fuck
That's probably why they say they hate my guts
My buzz is so crazy and they can't take it
That's probably why they say I'm aggravatin'
I'm killin' y'all broke bitches and all y'all hasbeens
Put my condolences and flowers on your caskets

[Chorus]
I don't know
And I don't care why they hate me, to me it's so funny
Cause while they're all hatin', I'm gettin' this money
Think they just so mad and I be laughin', bitch
I'm good even when I'm baddest
Is there a doctor in the house for the bitches I make sick
I gotta keep a condom cause they stay on my dick
Can I get a moment of silence please?
Rest in peace to the bitches that's dying to be me
Dying to be me, dying to be me
