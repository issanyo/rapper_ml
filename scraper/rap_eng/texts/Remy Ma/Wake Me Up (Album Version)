[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Remy duffed 'em
I told you not to touch 'em, it's not up for discussion!
All my clothes is custom, straight from France
My hands like Mayweather's, all my friends 8 and better!
I get a, lot of money, honey
Queen Bitch, inf beam bitch
Body a guy for my guy make you a meme bitch
I'm his dream bitch
Mean bitch, take one for the team bitch!

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Wake me up, mmm, when the mornin' come

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch!
You fake-ass bitch, you owe homage, pay that shit!
Spray that fif', the crown, I'ma take that shit
'Cause you a clown and Homey don't play that shit!
See, they ain't slick, be talkin' all cray and shit
And then you see 'em, they be like that they ain't say that shit!
I hate that shit, I can make or break your shit
See, I got options, don't make me weigh them shits!
I heard he lay that dick, you let him filet that fish
You just met him, how he bae that quick?

Take that trip, get money, make that lick
Take your pick; that's your set, claim that clique!

If that's your dog, I suggest you go train that bitch!
