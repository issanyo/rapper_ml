[Intro]
I could fuck your bitch, oh, she thick
I could fuck your bitch, I'm lit

[Hook]
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho

[Verse 1]
Pull up in a Royce, suicide the doors
Jeweler got me gold, oh it's getting cold
Damn, I'm looking fresh
Diamonds in my (?)
Drank in my cup, I just got a check
I just got a check, pussy niggas slept
I don't wanna fuck, I just want the neck
Timbs on my feet just to run the street
All my hoes fleek, Chanel every cheek

[Hook]
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho

[Verse 2]
Damn she looking bad
Where she get her bag?
Who did her hair?
She got all the swag
Jacking on my fit
Her ex ain't shit
Told her that I'm rich
Took her to the Ritz
Fucking on your bitch
Got this nigga sick
If he wanna trip
.40 with a kick
Nigga on me brave
(?)
Racks on deck
I'ma run it up

[Hook]
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
Pull up in a Royce, now I got your ho
