[Hook: Dre]
If a nigga talk shit to me
Nigga all I know (Kato, Chi-Town Rest in Peace my nigga)
I let them things go
I let them things go
If a nigga talk shit to me
Nigga all I know. Yeah
I let them things go
I let them things go

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Hot child warned 'em but he wouldn't listen
Then I had to run up on 'em with that thing that glisten
That nickle plated 40 mil thats for the real
All the city be talkin who they thought he was ?????
I guess the game done changed
See we come up in the 80' belive me it ain't the same
Lord forgive my temptation to kill
But I got to give this fagots the deffinition of real
Gotta keep it clapin' cause this streets is ill
B'live them niggas sleeky cause they sleepin on crilts
When we back up niggas pack up and move out
Cause we animals, we abduct and pull out
Washed up rapper you not respected
4 years passed and can't even sighn to Koch Records
Check it:
You won't be the first to get his first on
Quit rap biagon and get to church on motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
...see it's the squadres and we Terror so this niggas better listen
If I touch it I destroy it, they callin me demolition
But my name is Remy Ma, get smarten or reminiscein
If you be's that nigga you can call me that bitch
But if you don't know me
Don't call me shit
All I know I let 'em go if a nigga talk shit
I'm slicker then all you and all y'all can kiss my royal ass
I get's it poppin like a piece of a ????
My album is dropin nothing now it is a classic
First chick try to front first chick I'm smackin
And I'm known so sick bitch I spits backwards
Backwards spits I bitch, nigga I'm laughin
We don't need no passes we got all access
And I'm straight fire so please don't gass it
Cause I might blow my mic flow too hot
I let them things go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Selah]
I don't think that they ready
I'm a problem The worst and youngest one outta three
I'm a problem The first to get the gun and squeeze
I'm a problem Decepted personality
When I burst in rapidly your verse shoot backwardsly
You see the back of a hearse you can reharse that with ease
Take two I make you a superstar
6 o'clock news nigga, fuck who you are
Cause you nobody till somebody kills you
Pardon, so who is ready for stardom
Niggas talk gun clang
See I quit hearts harder
Like a cold block of ice you try to stop my life
Fuck my gun you better watch my knife
I ain't come to rap with ya
I came to scrap with you motherfucker

[Hook]
