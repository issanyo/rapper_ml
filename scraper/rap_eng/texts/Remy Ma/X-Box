[Remy Ma: Verse 1]
(It's funny to me I'm fucking laughing)
I heard these Biggie Small bitches is ready to die
Cause everybody say I'm Remy Ma the Queen of NY
The streets say she mean, and then she say she nice
I know I'm the BX Savior, Shesus Khryst
Fucking with me you better think thrice
Because I keep that ratchet, my mase, and my knife
And I don't pop pills but I will OD and
I'll pop that steel of a GP
See, I break ya jaw bitch, I been real
You the type of whore wanna  break my windshield
So stop acting crazy, cut the shenanigans
Yeah I fucked your man, and I'm gone fuck your man again
See me in the physical stiff like mannequins
Use they children for shelter scared to death panicking
Respect my handle bitch R to the Ezzy
X-box yes ma please believe it!
