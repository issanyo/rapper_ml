[Intro]
Oh really, this what y'all was doin' while I was gone? Playtime's over
I'm around, yeah I'm around
I, I'm around, yeah, yeah I'm around
I'm around, yeah I'm around
I'm around, yeah, yeah I'm around

[Verse 1]
I'm the queen, I got a crown, ho
I wet bitches, I try to drown hoes
This is punisher, I ground hoes
I don't play that, Homey The Clown hoes
She a deuce, she got chopped up
These pussies loose, she got fucked up
You act bougie, you get stuck up
I'm 'bout a dollar, you get bucked up

[Hook]
It's goin' down, yeah I'm around
Just touched the town, yeah, yeah I'm around
With my crown, yeah I'm around
I'm around, mothafucka I'm around
Money, I'm around, guns, I'm around
Cars, I'm around, drugs, I'm around
I'm around, tell them niggas I'm around
I'm around, tell them bitches I'm around

[Verse 2]
You a bug, I am so flee
I give you some, I am so me
That went over your head, I OD
I'm Bobby Johnson, I'm an OG
My hat, my 40 ounce, it's OE
I got thick hair, I hold heat
Hoes scared, y'all got cold feet
Your run is over, you a slow leak

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a felon, my gun go off
Burn bitches, I'm a blow torch
I cancel bitches, I'm a show off
I'm too hard, I got blue balls
I talk greasy, my mouth too slick
I'm on fire, the girl's fuse lit
I'm a bitch, I'm a blue pitt
I throw it up, bitch are you sick?

[Hook]
