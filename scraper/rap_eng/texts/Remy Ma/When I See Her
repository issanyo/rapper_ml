[Verse 1: Remy Ma]

January to December 12 months of the year
60 seconds in a minute it's a problem when I see her
7 days a week, alternate sides of the street
I'm a drag that bitch like the mothafuckin' beat
That's word to me I'ma smack her when I see her
You the type to be like "I'ma ask her when I see her"
And still be scared to death, you walk past her when you see her
See I treat her like a check and straight cash her when I see her
I'm a leave her when I see her, casadia when I see her
"It's me bitches" yea Swiss beater when I see her
See it's on when I see her, she a goner when I see her
Word is bond I'm on her, I'm a stomp her when I see her
I'm a put hands on her, I'm a snatch her when I see her
Like my lil' cousin Pat say trash her when I see her
These broads is garbage I be laughing when I see her
They be copping pleas like "Rem what happened? " when I see her
I don't question her when I see her, I address her when I see her
Wash her up and permanently press her when I see her
Apply pressure when I see her, disrespect her when I see her
This is chess but I'm a chin check her when I see her
I don't give a fuck yup! I'm a duff her when I see her
I swear to my mother I'm a snuff her when I see her
It's nothing when I see her, no it's something when I see her
That bitch best bets to start running when I see her
I dare her to talk back and start frontin when I see her
I just might snap and start gunnin when I see her
Now I'm a step to her like a grown woman when I see her
Naw, I'm lying ya'll already know I'm dumbing when I see her
Yeah I'm coming when I see her
See it's over when I see her
So don't act like I ain't never told ya'll when I see her
I'ma Ether her like Nas did Hova when I see her
And then come back like HOV, and take over when I see her
Ya'll could call me Diddy cause I ain't stopping when I see her
I ain't Lil Mama, but my lip gloss poppin' when I see her
She ain't rocking when I see her, cause I'm rollin' when I see her
I'm a have her whole fucking face swollen when I see her
Rem!
