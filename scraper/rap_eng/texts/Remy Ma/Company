[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Baby, what you want from me?
I been gettin' money, I could really put you on your feet
I was gettin' one visit, two phone calls, three showers a week
Now I get like 90K for my voice just to touch the beat, but yo
I will never ask you what you got for me
I just want some sloppy, every couple days I want the D
I don't need no E, I got some M's and now I got a G
Can't explain the nueva, boy, it's somethin' you gotta see, but yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She just want good vibes, she just need company (company)
She don't go outside unless she come for me (come for me)
V12 in my 'rari, who's catchin' up to me
My baby said goodbye, now she don't fuck with me
I ain't got no time for her, she tired of me (tired of me)
Fuckin' with my mind, she tellin' lies to me (lies to me)
Lately I been runnin' out of company
My baby said goodbye, now she don't fuck with me

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Yeah, see, I'm a real bitch, real niggas fuck with me
If I ain't send for you, bitch, then don't come for me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, hoe, I'm livin' comfortably
You not a G and took a L, why? 'Cause you ugly
I'm petty, it's fun to me, are you done? You dumb to me
I be laughin', all these chicks is Jackson, they a dub to me
I just bought another house, so now that makes that number 3
Now they call me marathon, because I really run the streets, yeah

[Chorus: Remy Ma]
He just want good vibes, she just need company (company)
He don't go outside unless he come for me (come for me)
V12 in my 'rari, who's catchin' up to me
My baby said goodbye, now he don't fuck with me
I ain't got no time for him, he tired of me (tired of me)
Fuckin' with my mind, he tellin' lies to me (lies to me)
Lately I been runnin' out of company
My baby said goodbye, now he don't fuck with me, yeah

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Baby, what you want from me?
I can put you on, yeah, I can put you where you wanna be
I ain't had no job, no 9 to 5, no, I was up the street
Now I got that guap, now I'm a problem, I'm a fuckin' beast
But wait, she just want good vibes, she just want company
She just wanna wear my diamond chain so they can know that's me
Every time she pull up in that V12, yeah, they know that's me
She just scratched my whip, she said I'm fucked up, now that she's over me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She just want good vibes, she just need company (company)
She don't go outside unless she come for me (come for me)
V12 in my 'rari, who's catchin' up to me
My baby said goodbye, now she don't fuck with me
I ain't got no time for her, she tired of me (tired of me)
Fuckin' with my mind, she tellin' lies to me (lies to me)
Lately I been runnin' out of company
My baby said goodbye, now she don't fuck with me
