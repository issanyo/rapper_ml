Fuck what you heard I am that bitch
And I'll pluck  a bird on some subliminal shit
You see I'm the type of chick that a be looking for you
You can't say nothing slick to a can of oil
Now reckless they talk out they mouth
And then I see them they talking about
That I ain't they one they talking about
See this is the shit I be talking about
Too many rappers running around these chicks is tricks Them niggas is clowns and I'm the only one holding the crown
The Queen of NY nigga  R to the easy please believe me
Yo that nigga that you loving tho
I got dough when he needs me
He don't wanna wife you, you a jump skeezy
And I got dirt on him so he tried to throw a seed in me
