[Verse 1: Mariahlynn]
'Bout a week ago made like 50 thou'
Went to business meeting at Mr. Chow's
I ain't takin' no losses, I'm gwinnin' now
Time is money, 'bout my business now
Mariahlynn, I'm a boss bitch
I don't care what it cost, bitch
All my diamonds is flawless
And all my homegirls is gorgeous
It's goin' down like Bernard Hopkins
Out in Vegas and I'm car shoppin'
M-I-A and I'm bar hoppin'
I'm booked bitch and the tour droppin'
Wake up and I'm countin' cake
Hit 'em with the money gun, shoot 'em in the face
Steppin' outside in a Ferragamo lace
Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait
I don't care 'bout the price
I just buy what I like
Louboutin with the spikes
I just went up on my price
I hop in the Lamb and it's lit
Pull up and I flex and I dab
Just bought some Benz [?]
I'm up and it's makin' them sick

Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike, ay'thin' new edition
These fake hoes be rentin' and Remy Ma so real
Ay'thin' is mine, mine, mine, call me Johnny Gill
Bitch, you see these heels, bitch, you see these wheels
When I come swipin' that black card, bitch, I ain't got no chill
I run up the, run up the tab, I come with the, come with the bag
I won, bitch, number one bitch, you angry birds so mad
See, I told ya stop playin' with me and ya hoes still playin'
Now show love, stop hatin' on me and ya hoes still hatin'
What I'm sayin' is "I'm up and you can't do shit"
I'm poppin' in real life, on TV and in music

[Verse 3: Mariahlynn]
Bottles pop and I pop out
Cameras flash when I hop out
Slayin' foreign fabrics, got foreign habits
'Cause what I'm wearin' is not out
You can find us in the store
I spend bands when I'm bored
Just put marble on the floor
I got style you can't afford
