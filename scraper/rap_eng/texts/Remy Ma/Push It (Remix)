[Intro: O.T. Genasis]
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money go get the money
This the remix and I'm lit
On the line cause my hits
Damn my plug Dwight Howard cause I'm waiting for the bricks

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
I'm on the west with O.T
I just flew in from the east
On that Bobby Shmurda shit, just caught a body last week
Since then wouldn't let me drink
When I get a post release
I'ma buy so many bottles they gon' think I'm Big Meech
When I caught that bird bitch I'ma put it to her beak
No I'ma put it to her brows, now they really on fleek
See I grew up in the 'jects
Had to fight for my respect
Elevator wasn't workin' so we took the pissy steps
I went years without no sex
So you know that pussy wet
And you ain't a real hustler if you can't bust a check, bitch

[Hook: O.T. Genesis]
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money go get the money
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Gotta push it to the limit
Push it like the Salt N Pepa
Put the bitch on the perky
The coco make her feel better
She got her groove back stellar
You ask about I'ma sell her
I got the white like vanilla
Call that Thrilla in Manila
Push it, push it, push it
Ask 'bout the back we took it
Get it from the fuckin' rookie
And I'm sellin' whole cookie
Got your fuckin' main bitch cookin', cookin', cookin', cookin'
You know, yea we sellin' coca
And we got all the yola

[Hook: O.T. Genesis]
