[Verse 1: JoJo]
Sweetie, I don't want your cookies
If you're looking for applause, keep lookin'
Your recipe's boring, need a little more spice in my cookin'
Honey, you don't want my problems
If you had 'em, you would sink to the bottom
You should bring your life jacket
Cause people like you can't handle this, no

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
Where were you when I needed you?
Tell me, where were you when I needed you?

[Chorus: JoJo]
Fake-ass bitches
When they smile in your face, but behind you, it ain't well wishes
When they eatin' all the food off your plate and they don't do dishes
When they words and they actions blur and they don't know different
No time for these fake-ass bitches

[Post-Chorus: JoJo]
You can go jump on a bandwagon
You, your money, and your lame-ass friends
Go 'head and jump on a bandwagon
With you fake-ass bitches

[Verse 2: JoJo]
I been down in the trenches
You should know but you don't pay attention
You wouldn't know real talk if it screamed out loud in your face, now listen
You got away with it, I believed you for a hot minute
Could've used a friend in the moment
But you had to go ghost, leave me lonely

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
Where were you when I needed you?
Tell me, where were you when I needed you?

[Chorus: JoJo]
Fake-ass bitches
When they smile in your face, but behind you, it ain't well wishes
When they eatin' all the food off your plate and they don't do dishes
When they words and they actions blur and they don't know different
No time for these fake-ass bitches

[Post-Chorus: JoJo]
You can go jump on a bandwagon
You, your money, and your lame-ass friends
Go 'head and jump on a bandwagon
With you fake-ass bitches

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
You not my BFF, you not my bestie
You a fake-ass bitch just like the rest
See, I was all the way down, you was all the way gone
Now you tryna come back cause I'm all the way on
I got both middle fingers all the way up
And for fraud broads, I don't give two fucks
If I say something, my moves'll back it
You be running your mouth and it don't match your actions
And I ain't throwing shade, I'm just saying
Act like it's a buffet and eat off your own plate
Cause it not a compliment when I say you fab
You just a F-A-B with your fake-ass, bitch

[Bridge: JoJo]
How about a hand for the real ones?
Put it down, had my back since day one
Never hear about 'em throwing no shade, no
So if you one of us, stand up
Tired of the gossip? Think you had enough?
Don't worry about 'em, middle fingers up to these...

[Chorus: JoJo]
Fake-ass bitches
When they smile in your face, but behind you, it ain't well wishes
When they eatin' all the food off your plate and they don't do dishes
When they words and they actions blur and they don't know different
No time for these fake-ass bitches

[Post-Chorus: JoJo]
You can go jump on a bandwagon
You, your money, and your lame-ass friends
Go 'head and jump on a bandwagon
With you fake-ass bitches

[Outro: JoJo]
Wit' yo' bitch ass
Wit' yo' bitch ass
