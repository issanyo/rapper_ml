(Hook: Clarence Liew)
When you come around and show me that smile you remind me
All I have to do is give you that love you deserve
For me it matters to wait for face to face
To tell you that I'mma feed you that good loving, ashe

(Verse 1: Shing02)
I know she's heaven sent, that's why I'm hell bent
I mean I have to be myself to stay relevant
Therefore it's evident, been smitten ever since
I had the blessing of meeting a lady radiant
So benevolent, she skips the gradient
Picnic on the median, nights like Arabian
Lately magnificent, sky I'm kissing
Highly reminiscent of the feeling I've been missing
Man on a mission is my title in addition
To you on my menu and a long list of wishin'
Ask for favors and prayers intermittent
It might feel permanent but know it's never given
That's the chime of destiny manifesting
Poster child going for gold chucking a javelin
Mind unraveling, driven
I'm Marty in Delorian traveling time

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
The you that amuse a combination of spices
My palette overflows with saliva, entices
We can be together like Osiris and Isis
Let me bestow you what nice is
And the me that you see a compilation of choices
Every song multiple layers of voices
Some samaritan and some into vices
You know my gifts come in all kinds of sizes
I might be killing it, take me as a villain or civilian by day, superhero Night-drillin'
Fire fighter starter kit, spark plus an etiquette
To be the baddest at the job, be an advocate
Of a risk-taking venture in the wild
Trust over money, go for broke for a wow
Live-versus evil but relative-to what?
Not a wrap till the skipper says cut

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Shing02)
You're bright as star, not obedient
Independent thinking and you know when to listen
Wire images your way, my remittance
When you chase the cold be gone, good riddance
Data forbidden, shall remain hidden
You can't be freestyling and busting a written
Doping and creatine a cardinal sin
I can find the strength within

(Hook)

(Verse 4: Clarence Liew)
We gonna show the world our loving, we gonna show
You walk out the door, you looking so fly
You tell me to watch while you strut on that tie
Wearing that dress, so smooth on the sides
Flawlessly blessing the ease on my eyes, yeah you
Don’t tell me that I don’t know what I’m missing
Apple of my eye, could you tell that I’m trying
Buddy’s on a rose, now you what I’m rolling
Asking all day and night not done trying
Honest to god he’s missing an angel
He’ll find her on a planet getting picked up by a mister
She’s tossing her hair, she’s smiling to herself
She knows that one day she’ll give into herself

(Hook)
