[Verse 1: Shing02]
Cause if you miss the last train
Then you're stuck 'till the first
In a land where there's no last call for alcohol
Kids in the hall will get crushed 'till their heads burst
Fingers out of focus with the deep thirst
For hydration libation line up like a patient
Waiting for a shot from a medic occupation
Such is life afterhours under pass tracks
The barracks called clubs
And cig butts fill the cracks
I ask the operator don't use the smoke machine
Go easy on the lights with the maximum sheen
I tell the kid in the front row to put it out
And he's the first one to flick a lighter no doubt
We building castles in the clouds with the guards gone
Even the ghosts join the party and you know it's on
Unless I take a cab back to the hotel
Or made the last train after all so don't tell

[Chorus]
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) I’m on the last train leaving
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
I’m out of breath barely breathing
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) I'm on the last train skipping town
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) This is my life so believe it

[Verse 2: Kero One]
The years '03, first tour in Japan
Rocking shows in Tokyo taking photos with fans
Next stop Tohoku region where I'll be meeting
Gaggle, DJ Mitsu, the Jazzy Sport family
In Sendai city, population 1 mill
Who knew in 5 years, this bustling city would be still
But now it's alive and well with every street's filled
Students in uniform, black suits dropping bills
Painting izakaya's ebony, boredom's the enemy
They glance, as we pass lugging merch up the mezzanine
Sound check, mic check the shows wrecked
Sake and Gyūtan, before the sun sets
A couple hours of sleep and we're off to the next
Leaving behind snow and clouds of fog from my breath
We board the train...

[Chorus]
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) I’m on the last train leaving
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
I’m out of breath barely breathing
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) I'm on the last train skipping town
(Kero One) I'm on that first train getting in
(Shing02) This is my life so believe it

[Outro: Shing02]
So another day under the belt, another one for the books
Job like no other let's get this show on the road
I can wake up not knowing where I am
Sometimes I'm so tired, forgetting who I am
Then it comes back when my dream disappears
Like a screensaver game of life, gotta pack and jam
