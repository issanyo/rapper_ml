(Hook: Shing02)
Fresh outta box, fresh outta box
Fresh outta box, fresh outta box
It's that feeling, it's that feeling
It's that feeling, talk about that feeling

(Verse 1: Shing02)
Fresh outta box and the smell is appealing
Style so fresh you know it's worth stealing
You already hooked on to what we dealing
Like dope furniture, we in the building
Boy I got a fresh verse ready for you
Sick lyrics are twisted and it's all brand new
Hype like the first time you heard bizarre ride II
Whiffed the ink of the cassette and it felt weird too
'Cause when I was a youngster I only knew the chorus
Didn't hear the verses my brain was porous
Now I listen back and I'm like oh what
He was dropping mad science and I slept through class
Left the syllabus on the bus, legends still bust
On the record they cuss, we imitate and discuss
Game recognize game, and that's a must
The news didn't like it and blamed it on us
Sold straight outta trunk so what the funk
Made a whole scene out of it, a legendary dunk
From the free throw line the rest is history
In this day and age we are the industry

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
G-G-G-G-Girl I made a cool mix tape for you
The songs that are on it are fresh like dew
And I pause-mixed my fav jams and tunes
I put hidden gems and oldies too
You can check it on the tracklist I wrote on it on the cover
With a marker so it doesn't have to smear
You'll hear the intro and you know how softly I killed it
Title is cheesy but you love how I milk it
I can't wait to hand deliver it
One man Fedex en route, I'm deliberate
With the presentation that I planned with patience
Mad information just to have you feel amazing
Fast forward you can burn your own cd
The internet MP3 is a freebee
You can send links and upload a mix
Get likes on your page, but you won't get a kiss, nah

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Shing02)
Oh you got a fresh idea? Let's put it on a silk screen
Print it on a t-shirt and wear it on the avenue
1997, I started e22, made hella patterns and I sold plenty too
Enough that I had to hang it up to do music
Blame it on the resource, was mine to choose this
Over the other, took a while for my mother
But I met a lot of brothers in a band to discover
The world as we know it but the map is so plane
Fill it with experience and borders are in vain
You meet kids everywhere, crazy savages
Wise intelligent, more than the packaging
So I miss that era in my own mind
A notepad and a pen that I can't find
Hot damn it no ink, where's the cartridge
Pa-pa-pa-pa, ask my fam partridge

(Hook)
