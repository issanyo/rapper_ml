Just another lazy afternoon
I'm tired of being bored it's time to take the board out
Hit the south side
Strap it on the top or slide it in the back seat
I'm the driver, she chilling in the taxi, glancing
Over the freeway feeling kind of lucky not going to an office
Instead going straight to the point, Diamond Head
Maybe on the way pick up a cup of coffee and bread
Or order some soda and poke bowl, whatever the feels
Extra protein and carbs, gotta burn your build
The temple of the body, feeling godly
I'll be back again 'morrow morning, probably

On the south side
When you're driving on the south side
South side
When you're cruising on the town side

It's still a mystery to me
How the moon pulls the body of water
And causes the tides that we ride
And the cycle signifies the womb of a woman
Life is a common tie that exemplifies
The fact we're all connected
Not just in the physical form
But also in the tethering state of mystical
Born from a single cell into a full-fledged being
Human is a name is a title is fleeing
Surrounded by cobalt blue and emerald green
A blank slate of mind, nothing in between
Me and the ocean
Except for the piece underneath my feet
Such a pure retreat

On the south side
When you're riding on the south side
South side
When you're cruising on the town side

It's the mellower shore for sure
Don't get it twisted though
You can get pounded like dough
I lost my keys once out in the blue
She ripped it out of my pocket nothing I could do
Carried a 9' 6" back to my friends
And I had to call a cab just to go get a spare
Break into my own pad a messy affair
Hitch a ride back, and I'm right back on square
One where I started earlier in the day
Fast forward a few hours, learned something today, hey
It ain't easy to make it look easy
Struggle is real but the weather breezy

On the south side
When you're chilling on the south side
South side
When you're cruising on the town side
