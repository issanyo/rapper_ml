[Hook]
If we can't make love
We can always make peace, can't we
If we can't make love
We can always make peace, can't we
If we can't make love
We can always make peace...

[Verse 1]
Can't we have a minute or two?
To come face to face ya know
Just name the place and
I'mma be there half an hour early
So I can feel the joy in my chest
While waiting for...
Even if you' re late a couple of ticks
It'll feel like forever to sit
In front of the building
Watch the crowd walk by and you're not in it
Doubt reach a limit
Then you surprise me
With your presence
The dopest present of all
Totally in awe
By the simple fact that you came
Plus you answered my call

[Hook]
My body love you like water
Dry land thirst to the highest order
Sweet memory saved on recorder
Two pal birds sitting on the border

[Verse 2]
So much on my mind and yet
Before I lay to rest I find the space to
Think about a long lost friend
Wherever the excitement went
So did the air and the heavenly scent
Now the stench of my own breath
Got me sucking on a fruit of death
Real life and debt around the world
Got me fiending on the times we spent
I don't know, how the two relate but they do, see
Believe you me
I never felt so wanted
Like a fugitive on a poster
But you already had me
Like a coaster on the bottom of a fine glass
Translucent the most
A reason to pass n' pour from a sealed bottle
We can crack shells like a pair of sea otters
Gaze like crystal
Geyser with the mineral
Rich with the natural gift

[Hook]
My body love you like water
Dry land thirst to the highest order
Sweet memory saved on recorder
Two pal birds sitting on the border
Now break it down like...
