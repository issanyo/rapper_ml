(Hook: Shing02)
We hi-coasting, the sun roasting brings
Tan coating skin, fun toting fling
So potent, fly like pollen, swing
Love boating, king Hawaii toasting, ding

(Verse 1: Shing02)
What, land of aloha, Waimanalo to Kona
White sands of Dahab to desert of Arizona
City of Angeles, Venice to Santa Monica
The governator said the state of California
Where I'm from the same size archipelago
I'm known to spawn mixes a cappella flow
So we take the heat and flash in Japonica
Shoot then take a break, Hayama to Kamakura ooh
Ruler of grammar and the master of tracks
Call me a finalizer comp, free radicals ionizing
Running around like rascals, cells terrorizing
When the poop hits the fan quit the analyzing
I'm in the present but in multiple dimensions
Did I fess up I'm dope, yes I did, off the grid
Thoughts transport the body, the body takes the mind
My focus is psychosis of the poets on the grind

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
Nothing is guaranteed or under warranty
But my care for you is infinitely novelty
Young and the restless, essence of energy
Target of envy everyday till we old navy
The coalition got the music ammunition
Vibes situate the people in position
Where hate is poisoning you know love is the remedy
The heart is beating like ch-ch-check out the melody
Bring back the pride fighting our prize is humanity
Could be as hard as diving and finding a manatee
Super competitive so much for parody, repetitive
But my original flavors are clean of additives
And right about now we can let it be
While commuters take a ferry, I can swim in my estuary
You can drop off the load for me to carry
It's true, your face is my grace, your thoughts my sanctuary

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Shing02)
We put in years and yet still searching for benefits
The news is manic depressive, won't hear the end of it
You feel lost like a dentist on a pirate ship
Or a custom agent trying to fight the flow of counterfeit
Silent like a pantomime, swing of a pendulum
Could be controversial like the petals of chrysanthemum
But the point to get across above the net is that
If you wanna win you better risk what you bet

(Hook)
