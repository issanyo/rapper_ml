My vision 20 / 20 / 20
Nuff asaid, I can end it right now
But let me get my hit like pow!
Freaking heads like oh shit, mouth open like wow
'06 stop pretendin' like u dont know how
God damn it, which god should we ask
Can't we all get along, who we?
Huh not to say we ever did, but oowey
Oh how numb you gotta be to act dumb
When they take a candy away while u sucking your thumb
Stuck in a lump of mediocre runners, nope not in my camp
Gunners style, league hustle the champ
Ooh its getting closer to crunch and faces acting reptile
Cold blooded versus warm blooded in erectile
Position submission, u wishing u were rather fishing
But the kitchen full of hungry kittens itching for the ditching
Get your paper straight before the last leg taper
Blast off this planet code hyper

Lift the fog up
See thru the mock up
Real hook up
False flags pick up
Fly touch up
Can't stop us
Dirty coppers
And penny droppers
Get ya propers
Time to step up! lift the fog up
Press down push up
Keep ya chin up
Now put ya hands up
A la stick up
Dem can't stop us
Fad hoppers
And eavesdroppers
Get ya propers
Who gon' step up?!

Heart bindu, cobalt blue
Circulating all-city like a sold out brew
Already been thru rite of passage, paid dues
Collected notes hand to hand like a toll booth
Now I'm speedy gon' on etc
Etceteras stay behind like I feed these kids!
It's the saga of a leader but I heed the right message
So I be the one that beat the clock to the punch and
Hit the hole, score the golden goal and go to luncheon
Sound ascension, it's essential for the soul
I thought u knew, a plate of instrumental
On top of which I spill my beans like a lentil
Super fragile broken hearted mended with a stencil
Over the crack with a fat cap, wassup?
Blow whistle, danger than a DU missile
We won't let the flame fizzle
Like locking lips under the mistletoe bet ya spine sizzle

Lift the fog up
See thru the mock up
Real hook up
False flags pick up
Fly touch up
Can't stop us
Dirty coppers
And penny droppers
Get ya propers
Time to step up! lift the fog up
Press down push up
Keep ya chin up
Now put ya hands up
A la stick up
Dem can't stop us
Fad hoppers
And eavesdroppers
Get ya propers
Who gon' step up?!

So I talk weird, my flow's awkward, it's artwork!
Give it a mild chance, me spice is addictive
Nice wit a hint of vindictive
Attested by the audience, so receptive
Germ killer antiseptic so effective on immediate release
So free media dependency and u'll be able to see
Third eye sight, six, seven, eighth degree
My vision 20 / 20 / 20
Nuff said, I'mma end it right now
