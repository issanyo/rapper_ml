If I were to start again
Would I do it any different
Than how it went down
All these ups and downs
Like a buoy in the ocean
You think you're floating but
The waves cave in like the fall of the wall
That separate chance and order and
All you're trying to do is
Keep your head above the water
When the clouds bring rain
To refresh your brain
Bad memories fade
And so does the pain
Thus in theory it begs the question
Would I be better off without seeing these tribulations
Or is it necessary for a champion to meet
Trials on the path to true jubilation
Like getting to the finals and scoring a hat trick
Roar at the crowd never mind the theatrics
Will power alone can make the whole world pause
Like palming the globe like you own it
The synchronicities you couldn't have planned for
The stuff of a folklore
Even if you knew it was coming
You wouldn't have hit it
Like a high heat up and in, a bean coming in
While it's happening you watch your own body react
Jerk faster than the thought of, where my baby at?
Your entire life flashes in random access
Who the hell said you can't avoid what and taxes?
You can live free forever
Impregnate the earth
Before the spirit and the host link sever
For good like eternity, headed where the best be
Rest in serenity with my foreign family
Friends that stick with you
When you're sick with em
Then you realize that love makes blood a thick liquid
Make you warm in the cold like a cardigan
Fresh like a mulligan
Gonna start again

Are you with me?
Stay the course, why give up
When there's a light at the end of the interstate
Veer off wide and the ride might disintegrate
Please don't sleep now
You might not awake in the morning
Drive through the night just to fight this yawning
So you keep going till the break of dawning
But the eyes start to play weird tricks on ya
Reflection on the windshield flicks on ya
So you try to focus on the yellow line or the white poles
But the mist makes it impossible to follow
And you see little people on the side of the road
Waving at you like they know you
And they're already gone
By the time you can check the rear view
Then an old man in a bike scare the crap out of you
You read the speedometer, it says 65
Then he smiled with a wink and disappeared like an owl
Your heart skip a beat like a needle on a record
And it picks right up on a groove in a second
But that 100 millisecond seemed more like a thousand
Had mad dreams about cruising the islands
Then you get a grip like a vice on wood
Snap out of a trip like a mice trap would
You wanna take a leak but you don't wanna stop
Cause you can't look back like you're running from the cops
But you're not
Crack the window and ha you're freezing
Tickling the nostrils and choo you're sneezing
And you go, I can't do this anymore
One thing's for sure, I need discipline
Gonna start again

If I were to start again
Would I do it any different
Than how it went down
All these ups and downs
Like a buoy in the ocean
You think you're floating but
The waves cave in like the fall of the wall
That separate chance and order and
All you're trying to do is
Keep your head above the water
When the clouds bring rain
To refresh your brain
Bad memories fade
And so does the pain

Allow me to state it simply
The brutal truth exists within me
I plea mea culpa but not for forgiveness
Cry me a river, nah right, if I could kiss
Miss devil on the temple bye, adieu
And if I avoid contact for a few
I can void a contract like a two-face
The last word tastes cool but it ain't food like toothpaste
Take a mint and a hint
See a tint in your iris, a dent in my pride
D.i.y? oh f.y.i recognize I can fly and I'm not gonna hide
So I treat every week like
Eat every meal like
Write every song like it's gonna be my last
In the instance should I be tapped to go the distance
Would I feel ready to leave everything
All the shenanigans
Imagination flows infinitely
Like a game of ping pong on a table made of glass
In a room full of mirrors and you let the days pass...
