[Chorus ]
All these years
I’ve been waiting for you babe
To see you once again

All these years
I’ve been waiting for you babe
To call you once again

[Verse 1]
Yeah
So as long there’s a leave we gotta let you
Know that as long as there’s a stage for me to step to
Fly to the moons and Neptune
Nobody except you will ever come close like I pulled the thunks out, the heart strings
Then you played it like a harp now my heart sings
When you hiding in the shadows my heart sinks
And the farther you drift I can't think can’t quite gone empty
Whatever happened to the field gives plenty
Whenever I caught a glimpse of you parted pull my arm will descending
The upside down in this vertigo
Too many choices can leave you stranded
The world in your palm is still and I understand it
I’m still charged at looking for an outlet
I have forgotten where we met
That I've finally found that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh
So many variables
But I want you to be the constant, my North star
Who needs a pickup line
When you’re the one that picks me up and the star's align
C’mon
It's called a sesergy more like a synergy
So many wise well will ask why
I don’t have for the answer just educated guesses
A message would lessen this sessions with essence
You know the less is more sometimes when i reminisce about the past
For times and everyday its fair but now
Sunshine, can't avoid it like a play can be
Cause I when i try to verbalize is that
No matter how fast the clock and chronicle flies
For good is this spot your name occupies
I've done sitting on porcupines
Imma call you mine

[Chorus ]

[Verse 3]
All these years
My space and hours
The longest silence
Devours the remnants of our lavish encounters
Where does it all go if the energy bursts in us concern
Waiting like planes by the windows of watch towers
And I remember the night
The space was ours

You didn’t open up to me
I could feel that in your eyes
Was sad interlude
They touch me deep inside
I could feel that in you now
Was a sad interlude

[Chorus﻿]
