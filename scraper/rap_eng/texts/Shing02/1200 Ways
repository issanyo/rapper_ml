(Hook: Shing02)
Twelve hundred ways that you showed me
How I can be the one for you and still be the old me
A pair of you and a mixer, trinity holy
In your arms is where I want to rest solely

(Verse 1: Shing02)
The video of you getting down on a kitchen table
Turned me on as a sprung teenager
Rugged yet sleek in figure
Built tough on the bottom and silver on top
You were magnetic not a belt drive
Should I go at 33 or 45
Spinning platter like a mirror ball on a stage live
I wanted to get to know you inside and out
Turned me into somebody that wants to feel you
Everyday in my sight, even when I sleep tight
I can picture you in my dreams alright only
If I could get my hands on a set, good night

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
Over the years, I watched you grow up
Mark 2, a young model when I first met you
When we got close you let me pick your brain
Flipped you over and you didn't complain
I was amazed how you were so grounded
Touched your colorful wires, and sounds bled
Thin like capillaries, burned circuit I replaced it
Soldered ends that were meant to be
Copious amount of screws on the wooden floor
I know you let me in where others wouldn't tour
Around like some clowns but you knew that I'm legit
Sealed you up and now you're ready for the hits

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Shing02)
I heard they stopped making you a while ago
Cut you off the assembly line and in catalogs and still strongly
Pursued on the market like online dating
Servicing billion of records that are waiting to be slapped on
And the needle to be played and be scratched on
Like all digi everything you gotta be kidding me, right
How can they replace thee?
I mean a moving disc with a piece of plastic
Putting a scooter ahead of a sedan
The young guns don't know any better cuz
Once they get to spend a day with you, hot damn

(Hook)
