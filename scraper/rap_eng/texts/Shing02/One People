[Verse 1: Shing02]
One People

People call us naive, backwards petwater bottle rocket science
March with them picket signs made of pizza boxes
Oxytocin intoxins
Drum circle live from zuccotti park to the port of oakland
Where did they come from, comfort of their homes
Take it to the red zone, rubber bullet to the dome
Suckers spying the web like they used to tap phones
Hellfire missiles dropped by predator drones
700 billion a year for defense huh
More like offensive on the 99 percent that
Still shop at stores named 99cents
So I'll chip in my two for the popular dissent

[Hook]
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

This one's for
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

[Verse 2: Shing02]
I Get off the couch to the parade to the general assembly
Springing up like bamboo shoots in monsoons
Fooled once, duped twice, bamboozled for strikes
It'stime for your conscience to put up a fight
Motherhuggers,real lovers know what it's worth, yes
Price tags can't have enough zeroes to purchase
Every little thing that you can bake in your pie
You can try to divide but impossible like pi
Occupy this speech, besieged
Land property seized improperly
You can break the monotony
Bored of living on a board of monopoly
This game of life is still odd to me
A dream is a lot less brighter than it ought to be
Poverty spread like a tumor on top of the
Average income pulling household economy
Taxed out the gate, gotta topple the authority
Truth almighty on this side of the barricade
Doesn't matter which one us you interrogate
Wanna bet what changed since the watergate
Juliet told Romeo to serenade

[Hook]
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

This song's for
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

[Verse 3: Shing02]
So my power point being are we ever gonna have
Peace of mind, body, and soul
Not likely if remotely controlled by the psyche of the flag
Shipping off labors and disturbing our neighbors
Distributing rations of irrational behavior
Trapped in an orthodox, looking for a savior
He ain't second coming when u guessing his name
Xavier onassis, minute hour day month year time elapses
Neuron fire lapses
The war intensifies overseas white lies
Life of a butterfly, better yet a sacrifice lamb burger
Lettuce and tomato on top with the curly fries
Hot sauce burn your upper lip
Truth makes you bite your tongue
Here's a serum take a sip
Real activists show more heart than a click of a hactivist
Who cares about evidence of relevance
Self-governance or face detriment
Let freedom ring Tahrir to Tiananmen
So would you keep mum when they hush
Or would you paint your own picture with a brush
So would you keep dumb when they crush
When your button is pushed

By the people
