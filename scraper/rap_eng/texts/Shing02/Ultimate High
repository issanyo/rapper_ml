In this world
Expectations are rarely met
Especially, if you dare to dream to set 'em high
Way above the standard
The so-called protocol
But isn't that what we're supposed to do
In this lifetime of ours, last hours or not?
When the temperature rises
And the plate gets hot
You start to see the true colors
In folks you once felt close
Those you care about the most
And one by one turn their backs on you
Put their own priorities ahead of you
When you know for a fact
You know for a fact
You would put your life on the line for them
Even in the craziest of situations
Without hesitation like in a blink of a fly's eye
Thats right, ain't no two ways about it
Ay yo, I really do mean this
At the end of the day
Its like yeah, here we go again
How does it feel to be alone at night
You gotta keep at it
When nobody's watching in the audience
If only I had an angel like a guardian
To guide me to the path, so lost
Like a stray dog without a place to call home
Roaming the streets for a scene long gone
No familiar faces or friendly tones
But then, but then, but then, but then, but then
I put my headphones on and play my song
And then, and then, and then, and then...

I can come run to you
And tell you the kind of things
That most would never know
Cause they won't even show
An interest to hear
This here is like a prayer
Except I don't wait for a reply
The timing is already perfect
When I'm down and out
On the ground licking wounds
Some old, some new
You come through and be a real mate
With care unlimited, unconditional
Nuff of the trade-offs and calculated talks
Just take a walk, face lit by the full moon
And sit by the oak tree, put my head at ease
Then I release
All the pent up energy
Let the eyes secrete
And to know for the first time
That everything is free like it ought to be
Clear the mist of miscellaneous data
On my mental desktop
Foreground music, blast melodramatic
The feedback is automatic
Rocks the body electric
It makes you wanna say

Fuck sex, it's the ultimate high
Original organic till the day that I die
Ecstasy, poetry in motion
Brain drug factory churning out the potions
Catalyst for a runaway chain reaction
Designed to give that pure satisfaction
Trigger a moment
Much bigger than life, defined by the media alike
What I like and I dont like?
Disconnect, reconnect to the channels I want
To receive the feed of rush delivery
To the vessel, fly ride like a fleet enterprise

Once the damage is done
Say whatever you want, hon
Nah, you're not sorry
Why worry now that I'm so over it
Would I ever lose faith in this world
So I won't set myself up for yet another fall?
Nah cause I've seen many grown-ups
All bitter, words full of pessimism and cynicism
Whatever the reason beneath the surface
A dark force took a toll on a young mind
It might have been a case of a shattered heart
Courtesy of somebody he or she trusted deeply
Or it might have been a picture of modern-day slavery
Painted for 'em ever since nursery
And today if it ain't the artificial state of fear
Might as well be the sound of Babylon
Collapsing on its own weight
Oh wait, and as a bonus, the weather getting eerie
Minds growing weary, you got a con theory?
Wouldn't doubt it, but seriously
Your whole outlook is clouded
Like a windshield in the winter
And get stuck like a splinter
On a ring finger, wood-shedding in the back
I begin to piece together these clues
How you might end up with an ego on bruise
And out in the cuts, like a recluse
But then, but then, but then, but then, but then
I put my headphones on and play my tunes
And then, and then, and then, and then...

Right when you figure that you've seen it all
And you've heard it all
That everything great is cemented in the past
Freeze framed for eternity
Never to be topped or tampered with
Think again my friend, what if we opened ourselves
To see the bright talent around us
It can be so damn refreshing
To know that a fellow human being
Can manifest miracles despite
Equally stricken with the laws of gravity
Always had to be self-appointed, thus anointed
And you heard this yet
Difficult to apply like a job out of league
The truth hard to deal with
Take a dose to conceal with
A quick fix but why would you
When you also know it could be too good to be true?
Yeah you gotta be the one
To search for ethereal high
We gotta be the ones
To be that stereo in the system
Bring balance back to an equilibrium
Its that one note you hit
However short it may be, a flash on a retina
On a whim, catch a glimpse into the next realm
Hues brilliant to overwhelm
It makes you wanna say

Fuck sex, it's the ultimate high
Original organic till the day that I die
Ecstasy, poetry in motion
Brain drug factory churning out the potions
Catalyst for a runaway chain reaction
Designed to give that pure satisfaction
Trigger a movement
Much bigger than life, defined by the media alike
What I like and I don't like?
Disconnect, reconnect to the channels I want
To receive the feed of rush delivery
To the vessel, fly ride like a fleet enterprise
