5am, pavement a hint of blue
Opposite of mayhem look for clues
No visible signs of tires, lazy signals
Way home from a long night out and about
Faint sounds of paper routes
I can send shouts cross-town, check the time
The second hand pegged at first glance
Starts to move in a quantum chance
With help from back of the eye lids
Soles peel off the concrete
Feel free to complete
Unfinished poetry in a black book with a hook to boot
Staircase of air
Past the mezzanine eye level with multiple tiers
While stories ascend, vacant offices signs for rent
Sailing around the bend, around the bend, around the bend

An upward stream will take you there
Bizarre affair
Balloon mind state
Hovering straits
Dock to ships, piers for windows appear to kindle
Giant murals painted by rays
Chisels produce all shades of gray
Sun dial towers over parks
Light devours remnants of dark

Diodes slowly fade to rest
Material properties made to test
Unprimed canvas staff of cables
Early birds sound off in triplets
Silhouette on billboard
Getting up in the frame
Without leaving a single trace
Underneath, leaves waver like seaweed
Train cars sleep in beds for eels
Miniature models, life-size goals
Am I flying? more like swimming in a
Metropolitan aquarium
Let go of equilibrium
Million-volt phosphorescence
Oscillating reflections

Bit by bit increase resolution
Bit by bit gain perspective
As I come down rubber kiss the asphalt
Eerie stillness, teary yawn
Hour glass smashed by tide of dawn, tide of dawn, tide of dawn

More like swimming in a
Metropolitan aquarium
Let go of equilibrium
Million-volt phosphorescence
Oscillating reflections
