Island of happiness
Joy bliss and tenderness
Scenery heavenly
Hand picked delicacy
Grandmother's recipe
My mom's working on it
My friends tripping on the
Weekends it's gonna be a
Splendid springtime
We spend it in the sunshine
Easy on the fun I'm
Chilling like a wind chime
Let nature be our guide
Maybe we'll take a ride
Travel the countryside
View of the pacific tides
But on one march afternoon
A little before three on a Friday, boom
As the world got turned downside up in a soup bowl
Made everybody miss their rooms in a group home
Nests collapsed, trees flushed
Away, and left nothing
Had to be high and dry
Wet dolls with stuffing
Can't even blink when you don't have time to think
A lit wick on the brink of being extinguished in the wind
In the wind

The waves moved in with impunity
Unplugged the power and
Force quit the memory
A vacuum of community
Shaken foundation in a wake of a tragedy
Live communication for the sake of the families
A lost tribe gripping on mobile devices
What's the focus to be alive during a crisis, life is

Island of emptiness
Who could have thought of this
How could you ever miss
Something you forgot existed
When you least expect it
You can get disconnected
Try as you may
It's hard to remain unaffected
As the world wept another news swept in
Stole the headlines and
Sent ripples worldwide
Old plants crippled
Stems snapped like pickles
Seeds blew out pollens
Hot like popped kernels

The goodwill poured
From four corners of the globe
To help the S.O.S. in strobe
Oh the work to restore dashed hope and the strength to cope
With the cold facts to swallow till tomorrow
Image of catastrophe
Travel in telepathy
Push back the fears
Shed tears, and kill the apathy
We can reach out and each one
Teach one to fight the wicked things they bring being
Carried by the wind, by the wind

The rebuilding
Starts from the day you stand up and then decide to pick
Up a tool or you can read up on a book
This group has no symbols or an insignia
The axis we're placed on is linear
And our great heritage is circular
Divine and miraculous
Encourage every child
The entourage will be waiting for
Journey in a galaxy of trillions of planets tour
Places beyond far
And you might pass a shooting star
Fall in love, someday the cycle will continue
And you'll see the joy that I receive for seeing you in my timeline
See the joy that I receive for seeing you in my timeline

Refine the work we did, (ready set)
Define the thoughts we felt
Now is the time for us
Now is the time for us

Island of happiness
