[Scratch Intro]
"One, One, One"

[Verse 1]
This is just a little rap song
Built upon a simple note
Other styles are bound to follow
But the root is still hip-hop (hip-hop)
Now this new one is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
There's so many rappers who can rap and rap and rap
And just say nothing
Or really nothing
They have used up all the styles we know
And at the end we've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into this one mic
All the love I feel for you ("...one love")
Anyone who wants the whole show
Let him be the one fo sho
He will find himself with no show
Better go for what you know

[Scratch Hook]
"MCs act like they don't know"
"...What?" "One love!"

[Verse 2]
There's so many rappers who can spit and spit and spit
And just say nothing
Or really nothing
They have used up all the styles we know
And at the end we've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into this one mic
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Let him be the one fo sho
He will find himself with no show
Better go for what you know
