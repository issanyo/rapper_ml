Kon'nichiwa I'm b-rhymin
And I'm here to do an assignment
Never quiet never silent
Always dripping shit thats timeless
And I'm always at my finest when I'm on the mic and I'm rhyming
Rawer than raman like a raw mineral like a diamond
Lyrical invasion with some Asian persuasion
And yo I can't keep on waiting for these haters to hate it we go
On and on and on and on
Nothings wrong when you put b-rhymin on a song



Yeah whatever he said, don't understand then press reset
Shing02 and b-rhymin fuck with us you'll surely be dead/
Stay on topic don't degrees
This ain't school in progress no recess
I use my head not my penis/ and that's why I am a fucking genius
Impregnating these rhymes just like was spitting semen
See man I can flow much than the sea can
Its a different kind of drug that kids are do it on the weekend
It's called hip hop that everbody fiends In


44k remix I show no weakness but uniqueness
I make great songs for y'all even when I'm sleeping
I go to school in the morning then come home and rap for the evening
Rapping against me Is like the number 3 it's just not even
Recognize I hope by now that you have realized
That I'm no punk but I'm one of the real guys
That's left in hip hop that's what I feel inside
So when I spit I spit hard so I know you'll feel my rhymes
