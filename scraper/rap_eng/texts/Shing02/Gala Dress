Chorus
I dedicate this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand isles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala with a myriad of guests...
Send this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand miles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala...

[Verse 1: Shing02]
A fine morning
Dew on web
Paper on steps
Hop outta bed
And let's get fed
A special day
Crease on legs
Collar on neck
Cuffs on wrists
Atop on my list
Or should I say mind
Runnin' em errands and checkin' on time
Since I don't wanna be late
For a chance to hug and congratulate
On everything and anything it's all love
Takin' in the stuff a good life is made of
Trees with the leaves give the seeds and the fruit
We can eat, feast, and drink on the juice
Cheese for the lenses, cheers with the friends
Here's to the peers who will stay till the end
And when I'm talking to the crowd like who's missing
Speak of the devil she sends me a text
Out and about, fixing up her dress
She sounds like a mess so I message her re: "don't worry be chill
But hurry if you will, don't miss a plate of bomb coconut curry"
She laughs it off like I'm catering jokes
And I'm savorin' the semi-colon-p that she wrote
I'm so proud I could prance on clouds
Nothin' in this world stresses me right now
Two hours pass and gettin' kind of antsy
Cruising the venue and ladies lookin' fancy
But all of that, disappear in a drop of a hat
I had to break in the middle of a chat
To comprehend the gravity of the
Moment the door parted
A monumental momentum shift in the whole set
A silhouette of a dress, burned to memory
Pop a mentos and mozy my way over to greet
An instant center of adulation
Undeniable infatuation
If it were in fact written, my gosh
Cause I must be smitten from the dome to my sole
And the role that you play is the star that is lone
In the play that you make incredibly your own
May I make a comment on the garb you have on?
Makes the rest just pale in comparison'
Magnificent texture, extraordinary
Very fly with the pattern, intricate embroidery
Nobody in the house can make it look better
Than the body inhabiting it, on the realla
Sorry if I'm overboard with the compliments
But I'm overcome with the sentiment
How I wish that I won't forget
The way her blush matches the bright character of her dress

Chorus
Yes, I dedicate this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand isles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala with a myriad of guests...
Send this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand miles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala...

[Verse 2: Shing02]
A fine evening
Trail on web
Pep in steps
Blocks ahead
Let's, she said
A young night
Clique in tow
Diner booth
In hoodies and sweats
Stroll outside
Bathe in lights
Feels different
With her in sight
The air she carries
A pocket of hearts
Sittin' face to face
With hands in place
Here's the deal
Mixed in with a dream
Well, I guess you could call it a scheme
But a scam, never that
Even in the oddest key
You are the goddess, see
Who got me on this odyssey
Honestly, I don't have the slightest clue
But I have a grand vision of what I aim to do
To hold you, in every part of the world
And having fun on the road, it won't ever grow old
