(Hook: Shing02)
I'm that boy that you wanna be down with, can you keep up with me
I'm that boy that you wanted to be down with, but you switched gears on me
I'm that boy that you wanna be down with, can you stay up with me
I'm that boy that you wanted to be down with, but you switched gears on me

(Verse 1: Shing02)
I'm that boy that you wanted to be down with
So I came and lounge with the girl who's in love with
My profile from the jump the get-go
Colors are fresh yo don't blink like gecko
Online greetings, offline meetings
Daytime cafes, evening cuisines
The grid can't stop us, light cycle hoppers
Time robbers and window shoppers
Then it's time to take a break for work
When we're apart you sent some nice words
How much you missed me, so much you dissed me
This means now I'm on the hot seat
I feel the heat, every now and then and some for my mishaps
And hiccups I'm like alright I'll sprinkle cups of
Honey bunny sugar pie sweetness
Add a lullaby in the mix and we're speechless

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
As opposed to talking that cesspool
Your chest poofs but my vest proof, you best move
First, can we talk about the good times
That we had and haven't had yet, the right vibes
Hustle on the daily, put us on the map
And a route that we take is the one less traveled
With a one-way ticket the off-road gravels
More to see, so scenic, ain't it?
Then your parents called and nature called me
You hopped on the bus and probably
Never looked back but it's all good
'Cause now I see you push like on my pics and I don't follow you
As much as I would if I were alone, but now
I'm dedicated to the path than I'm on so pow
Walk until the cog wheels fall off
I know in my heart that I worked my ass off
For your rocket to be built and to lift off
But I'm on my own shhh no need to be P'd off

(Hook)

I don't play dead or play for keeps
I don't brag tags, rich or cheap
It's like how deep are your eyes under the ocean gleam
What have you seen with your naked eyes and not the screen
Describe how you feel with your own style
Shared folder but a pass on the file
Can I crack the vial and get the code to dial
Then I can run a thousand miles, right

(Hook)

Don't switch gears on me, please?
