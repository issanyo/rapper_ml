[Verse 1: Shing02]
Now let me reach out to my fam across the globe
Whether you're out on the road or nesting a home
Looking for real work or carving your own
Feeling sky high or a little bit low
It's a new era and it's more than a brand of
Fitted caps on your brain chassis
Beyond the logo rep the solo
Confident glow appears classy
Carry the self in a positive light
In this age of darkness come twice as bright
Yeah act right used to be on the down low
Now it's so easy as a click and a
You said it, the message embedded in the frame
And you bet it is sweeter than canes

[Bridge: Shing02]
Real kings and queens walk the face of this earth
We all recognize life for what it's worth

[Hook: CAV3 & Shing02]
(CAV3)
We all are makin it day by day and
Livin' this life ain't always easy (whaoowah)
[Shing02]
Real kings and queens kiss the face of this earth
We all recognize love for what it's worth
(CAV3)
Cause its a story writtin on our hearts
All a man can do is just play the part (whaoowah)
[Shing02]
Real kings and queens kiss the face of this earth
We all recognize love for what it's worth

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Now if you worked for the bread that's
Baked by the man with some dirty hands
And he wiped on his pants
Wouldn't you wanna open up a bakery?
Just for the fakery
I mean cash rules everything in this creamery
I've seen kids selling flowers at the cemetery
Life is whatever you word it, b
Believe what you want, then let it be
Let it breathe, so we can truly be free
Of serving temporal codes and laws
Rulers with obvious flaws like obsolete metrics
Cling to their seats with claws
So if the world tears at the seams
Jump in feet first like a pair of jeans

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shing02]
We're all sick from the anecdotes
Gotta cancel out the poison with the antidote
Hip-hop taught me the right kind of dope
The kind to inspire, the kind to give a new hope
Like Episode IV, foe or friend both flex the force
Though it ain't only when you rock the vote
It's every time you pay a dollar for a bar of soap
Opera, on a map quest for rapture
A greater legend expands the proper
Cause a real MC's a philosopher
Teach the youth how to fight Lucifer
Give the fallen a chance to rise
To the clouds past smog on horizon
Let CAV3 paint downtown los angeles
Thick like a soundtrack by Vangelis

[Hook]
