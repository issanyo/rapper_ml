[Verse 1:]
I'm an airporter
Make a living on the road, kinda sorta
Let the songs travel across borders
And where I hear supporters that want me
I’ll board the plane on the dime, check the sky scanner
For the last minute deals, watch for the scammers
Give your info and it’s mad spammers
Not a tinfoil but I got a tape over laptop camera
Try to hit me with the tax $152
I know it burns gas but I’m burning money too
Wanna visit nations with the aviation
Been around the whole world on a delegation

[Verse 2:]
I ain’t left yet, huh
Packing my things on the day of
Even though I’m getting better save for
The equipment in the bag 50 kilos limit 23 lbs
And the cheapo airlines wanna charge
For extra check-in not a carry-on domestic
We the people, get what we pay for never treated equal
But I’d rather splurge on a hotel
So I’m riding coattail with a buddy pass
Walked past a kid in the first class cabin, call him Akira
Oversized chair, eyes glazed like a mirror

[Verse 3:]
So I’m chillin in the air, best be on my best behavior
Aforementioned pass affords me no saviors
Basically a second-class citizen on this side of the curtain
We breathing the same air, still separated by service, it ain’t fair
It got me thinking while i’m watching these movies
Reality is not far from my two feet
All the way horizontal like the booths at the internet cafes where I stay at
That contradicts what I said earlier, but I’m thrifty with it
Quick-witted language, lugging luggage

[Verse 4:]
Jetlag is always worse going eastbound
So I hit the ground running on a westbound flight
To the far east, cross the dateline losing hours
International plan switch cell towers on the fly
I kinda tripped out when the customs guy
Knew me already and smiled, wild
Such is the life of an airporter
Might as well be a teleporter
Catch me if you can runnin’ through terminals and crowded halls
Never kill time, barely alive for the final call
On the rebound y’all
