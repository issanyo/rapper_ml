(Hook: Shing02)
You gotta put a squeeze on it
You know you gotta put a squeeze on it
You gotta put a squeeze on it
So put a squeeze on it

(Verse 1: Shing02)
Grab the bull the horns, Jason Bourne
Gotta take a stand to right this wrong
'Cause if you don't say shit, it's the same shitty situation
Case in point, BS is what am I facing
The bass in your chest, it's a beat sensation
Get off the high horse a whole new relationship
We can look eye-to-eye but your brain on vacation
Eggs in the frying pan no more questions
Storm out the press room
Cut the conference short and be back soon
With a super soaker so never assume
Or underestimate the force of a nozzle, go boom

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
Ayo here's how it's gonna be, crazy as I wanna be
Box like a kangaroo, dance like a wallaby
I got a vision with an extra zoom, say
I can spot an a-hole from a mile away
So when the day goes bad with the whole plan
Take matters and the law into my own hands
Put my foot down, and my lone stamp
On the job in the field like a grown man
Or a woman who can handle her biz
Put in the work, and then pop the fizz
If it is what it is, then it ain't what it ain't
It's not for the faint of heart
You know you gotta put a squeeze on it

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Danny McEvoy)
McEvoy is hitting the track, you wanna rest soon?
Better put your back out, I'm aiming for the best tunes
I get my mic out and throw it to the sky
Spinning on the clouds trying to amplify the light in your eyes
I'll let you know that the fight's on
My light's on so you know that I'll be hitting it like Tyson
I've got my mind on the zone
And having that fact, man I never walk alone
And Shingo grabs the bull by the horns
I'll jump on the back pull its tail with some rollerblades on
You got to know the situation, get your preparation
And then you put a squeeze on the nation

(Verse 4: Shing02)
Whether you flash your teeth or lash out at an imbecile
I stop a foe out to embezzle
My funds and my glory, so appalling
Guaranteed victory, end of story
I pick my point and a place to cross the rubicon
Then drop a sound bomb by the megaton
Leave a crater in your head, I'm decepticon
To be the greatest that ever did

(Hook)
