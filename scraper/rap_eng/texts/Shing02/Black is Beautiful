Black Is Beautiful

Black is beautiful to me
Wake up brethren Asian persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
Love Self sistren Asian persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
Respect brethren African persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
One Love sistren African persuasion

Afro-centric music is the roots but
Ever since birth I've wondered
Who, what, when, which, how did we get to this place
Island culture cultivate the race
Faces, basic smiles speak a thousand words
That go a million miles
Until we realize that we gotta stay true
Despite the lies, read between the lines
And move forward
Oh Lord
Heritage manifest in the color of the mane of our men and women
New born, blessed with natural melanin
Living and shine like filaments
Pitch black hair, rich black eyes
Capture the rapture of mother nature
Beyond Africa, Pan Pacifica, Antarctica to South America
Health before wealth in the kingdom of righteous
Fight until death do us part and I might just
Travel to the depth of the heart of Atlantis
Pledge to the state of the art so I plan this
Expedition as my mission all the while
Competition lose not knowing why
Til the day I chill in the east of the River Nile
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah

Who wanna test their blackness?
Let me guess, fake jocks frontin' like Loch Ness
Life blessed you to look the best
When you're dressed with less but cover the rest
Some kids with straight strands want dread locks
Some girls with a fro want to straighten their chops
It's all good we all grow out of it just like hair-do
You gotta vibe and flow with it just like air do
'Round the globe youth carry the hope
That one day everything's gonna be just fine now
Press rewind to a world color blind
Zero complex, find a space all mine
I grew up on the East Coast, opposite of Ivory
In the 21st, reckon economic slavery
Beyond Africa, Latin America, through Jamaica back to Japonica
Man and machine make the money that manipulate
Mind over matter meaning make moves to motivate
Before we globalize commercially
We need to mobilize community to spread the music with mercy
'Cuz exploitation is the blast from the past
Conversation help future visions last
Til the day I fill the post I'm supposed to live by
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah

Black is beautiful to me
Respect all state, all color, all race
Black is beautiful to me
One love, one god, one mind, one heart

INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y
INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y
Receive, Respect, Reflect
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on
Receive, Respect, Reflect
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on
