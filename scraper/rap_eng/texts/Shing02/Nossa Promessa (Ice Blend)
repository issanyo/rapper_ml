[Intro]
This is a sad song
But also a pretty one, female, you know
And, um... since it's been a minute
I thought I'd write you something
And I'll make it short
I promise

[Verse 1: Shing02]
It's much harder to keep a promise
Than a secret, that I know
Cause the hands of time
Will change things in ways you couldn't predict
When you're young and innocent, so right
Until proven otherwise by those misty eyes
Staring over the waters
Dreaming of blue skies
And distant isles, miles away
But close to her heart
Like the charm on her necklace
Getting restless
How she laid by my side
Singing her favorite songs and lullabies
Had to meet by fate
So didn't say good bye
See you laters, better days in sight
We glorify life as we know it as an open book
Blank pages turn to filled ones
We took the scenic route to the train station
Let the clock pass with a conversation
Dear fellow traveller, drifting through the city
Like a seasonal wind from another city
Ooh she's an infectious groove
Once subjected to, be aroused and soothed
A tone rings hollow if I can't forget, but...
Luck follows where the hope is kept
So I set my goal and continue to step
O que e que aconteceu con nossa promessa

[Hook: Shing02]
Oh promete me
That you'll wake in bliss
Even if it's not next to me
Everyday I miss that zone
We caressed, yes
Very special like our first kiss
When nothing else mattered
But the sound of the lips mixed with the
Pound of the beat matched with the
Wave of the heat
Alleyways to the busy streets
From the concrete hills to the hidden beach
Our songs will reach
Rest assured
Treat each hour like the last I can afford
What's for sure
Best friends, we were made for
And yet trade speech like
Lovers on opposite shores

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like somewhere between scared and sacred
No lie, when I saw her naked
In the dark, sucked my air out like a vacuum
Never before, pale shades of gray meant more
To the lens
Hunger for real warmth evident
The thunder, a shock to kill for, heaven sent
Now understand that
My core yearns for raw touch
My soul has a hole, like a donut
That only she can fill
And I can feel her vibe enter
Hit the tender spot
Soft like chords on a fender rhodes
This year, I'll send her an electric rose
So who knows, that's how it goes
Beyond columns and rows, x's and o's
Yesterday I ran into a mutual pal
And he asked me, where in the world is she now?
My fellow traveller, the girl was the city
After she was gone, felt like any other city
All that was left behind, asymmetry
Your guess is as good as mine
No two will last long without trust
Thrust to the gut much stronger than lust
So I set my goal and continue to bust
O que e que aconteceu con nossa promessa

[Hook: Shing02]
Oh promete me
That you'll wake in bliss
Even if it's not next to me
Everyday I miss that zone
We caressed, yes
Very special like our first kiss
When nothing else mattered
But the sound of the lips mixed with the
Pound of the beat matched with the
Wave of the heat
Alleyways to the busy streets
From the concrete hills to the hidden beach
Our songs will reach
Rest assured
Treat each hour like the last I can afford
What's for sure
Best friends, we were made for
And yet trade speech like
Lovers on opposite shores
