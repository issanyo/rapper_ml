[Hook]
Snow flakes in January
Heart warm like February
I wouldn't ordinarily
March to the drum, play a fool like April
May the best dance in a Juno bridal
Power of the will, Julius and Augustus
Aw you know, it's just us
In a new semester, back in September
Boy, I wonder if you still remember

[Verse 1: shing02]
Meet me half way from mars to venus
Beep beep, the chase is on between us
Retweet the sweetest piece of confection
Hand made device for remote connection
Ask a question
Wait for an answer and make a suggestion
A time and a place for a first impression
Second and third to a fourth dimension
Rise above the weights that hold us captive
To a square, swear that I, I the captain to
Cruise in sci-fi, red sky burn like sapphire
A moth to a fire, but we can fly higher
Till we reach an apex
We fit tight like a glove with the latex
Bring it down to earth for a cooling session
Laying sideways and glazed in essence
Gazed each other in the eye to find galaxies of
Uncharted nebulas
Heard joy over spilled milk on a quilt, of lavender
Woven in the fabric of our calendar
Dress up at the end of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Verse 2: shing02]
When you took my hand, I couldn't hide it
Way too delighted
Tried to ride it cool but obliged to write it
Wouldn't fight it, how my watch paused
When I put my lips on your eyelids
The lost second, deposit in a memory bank
Every chance I pocketed a cent
A blank check with ya signature
Font sans serif, the curvature, a lone harbinger
With toys play coy like fish in a pond
Fond words serve poems like dish
Life is short like a doggone leash
Or a fuse in an open circuitry
That got struck by lightning
Hang a painting on the wall over the writing
Brighten up the room for a private dining
Increase the peace and cease the anxiety
Spread love and cc: the whole society
You got me shooting off on a tangent
Like I always do when I'm on the fringe
And the tally of the letters will reach
The valley where the wings will seek
A series so classic at the top of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin
