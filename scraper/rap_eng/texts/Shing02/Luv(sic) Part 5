Till death do us apart, and it did
Come sudden like clouds, and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let them whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

In your last breath you told me, that you had to go
Cause it pained you so
Oh I loved you so much so
Was I selfish to hold on
And cling on to your body that hosts a soul
That wanted to set free the eagle in a cage
And you became eagerly what I wanted to be
You the person to leave, I the person
To see off another best friend to land's end
I watched grown men moan, and women weep
As you quietly descended six feet deep
But the spirit ascended before our wet eyes
A gift from god, returned to sender
Though I like to pretend that this never happened
I can turn around and see you laughing
But the fact is you could never practice
Getting blind-sided and eating the wind shield
Endless field of shards of glass
This too shall pass, but reality bites, it says not so fast
First you must climb a calvary of shattered hopes
And then a mountain of prayers unheard
'till you reach that peak where you can see the dark abyss below
Then you let me know if you have what it takes for a leap of faith
I had to say, hell no, heaven yes, but not yet
Please bless a forehead, cold in a bed
Or alone on the road with nobody to hold
When the pouring rain is too much to bear
It's a reason to live for a seed that needs care

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let it whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Now I hit this stage in honor of you
How's the other side, I bet it's a splendid view
No more stress for rent, or to make ends
Collide in a cocktail, shame with envy
I can hide behind lens that block the UV
Looking in from the outside the bowl is murky
The toll for the bridge is rising
Weatherman says storm, city hall is burning
Same ol' chaos, gotta shut my cell like I'm waiting to take off
On the runway, scoping out the window
The moisture covers the sight though
Telling myself it's just another day in the life of a starving artist
Trying to paint a dream you woke from
Chasing the departed
We used to hang by the banks to see who can skip a stone the farthest
What I thought was a stream is now an ocean
No such thing as an extreme to show devotion
To your craft, which I didn't know the half
Tried to knock down your door and caught the backdraft
And a whiplash, all in reverse
Then I finally stood up and said, we reserve the right to serve anyone
And on the same note you deserve the best of the most fun
By the way I got your letter, you said you were fed up
Well I second that and I reckon that you tried
So I don't place a blame that you took the fifth
And the first flight out of town, into the mist

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
Your truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let 'em whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Whether a tree lives to see the end of centuries
Or a random hand picks it instantly
Life is art, a miracle for all to see
I must tell you that you lived beautifully
