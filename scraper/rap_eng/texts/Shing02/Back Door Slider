(Hook: Shing02)
Back door sliders BDS
Back door sliders BDS
Back door sliders BDS
When itâ€˜s time to make moves, we be the best
Pound for pound, we be the best

(Verse 1: Shing02)
Back door to back door, rendered service
No tender cash make anybody nervous but us
Style the opposite of rough plus
The transaction a nod and a handshake
ID not a fake or bake, it ain't easy being awake
Getting hooked up just a cherry on a cake
Or a pie a la mode with some pecan, so we can
Join the gang having fun on the weekend
Truck full of goodies, line around the block
Never cut to the top, escort to the rear
Entrance now we in the house, it's weird
How we get around the town around here
Down with the clowns that frown without fear
They gave me the key to the city it appears
Unlock the doors, make sure it's clear

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Shing02)
Bumper to bumper, burn gas and rubber
Necks on the freeway, give a leeway
Bypass congestion peppermint flavor
Mario Kart on carpool, ask a favor
But it's the labor that comes with the perks
Enjoy the fruit, first put in the work
You know the deal, you throw the slider
Wicked two seamer, then a high heater
Some come south paw, side winder
Submarine flows and the ump knows
Expand the strike zone, retire the clones
Shut it down, dead ringer inning changer
Jack Morris in his prime and
I'm in business class with economy prices
Pad that leg room, booth with WiFi
Pass security with soon to be wifey

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Shing02)
Waiting in a line? Never the case
Paying full price? Never the case
No more tickets? Never the case
Guest list full? Never the case
Stuck in a queue? Never the case
Lost in a town? Never the case
Out of ideas? Never the case
Show up on time? Depends on the case

(Hook)
