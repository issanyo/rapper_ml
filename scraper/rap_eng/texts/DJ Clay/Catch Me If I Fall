Juggalos and Juggalettes!
It makes me proud to announce... from The South of Hell
Boondox


[Hook (x2): DJ Clay]
Who gon catch me when I'm fallin down into darkness?
What have I created? my dreams fall apart when
A demon gets discovered, an angel has to suffer
Just leave me in my hell, I won't put nothin above us

[Verse 1: Boondox]
One brick from an inferno pinch
Fire in my veins burning like a bitch
So sick till I get my fix, I'm sweatin in the corner with a crucifix
Her tears they fall like bastard angels fall from Heaven's graces
This Hell I'm livin in, this sin, I'm seein' demons faces
The darkness take over, my senses fall into a coma
Mix blood and soma, wash it down with some holy water
Dance with the devil by the pale moonlight with a needle for my appetite
Get on my level, six feet in the dirt, never see the light

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Boondox]
No rest for this wicked soul and everybody suffer when it takes control
My family lookin at me like I'm the demon
I'm trying to hide it but they know, somehow they do
Gotta keep movin down this vanishing path
When I'm stuck in a chemical bath, soaking on my own behalf
But I'm takin them with me, as much as I try to lead them right while I go left
I know they're trying to help me but I gotta face this demon by myself
As I wonder who gave me this curse, it was me and yet no other
If I can't win against this demon, forever my angels have to suffer

[Hook]x2

[Bridge: Boondox]
On my knees I look to the sky, please, lord help me now
It's got me and I don't know how, but everything I know is gone
Sittin here I'm all alone, and trying to figure everything out
