[Intro:]
Exclusive shit, strictly for the fam
Me and my homie Bailz from Southwest
Hustle straight up murder shit

[Verse 1:]

[DJ Clay:]
I plug who you wanna plug, anybody can get it
What? Give me the word and it's done
You can stay on the block you ain't got to get up
Man I got this one dog, man it's murder I love

[Bailz]
It don't matter, we need to get 'em anyway
Just make sure you ditch the whip don't forget the K
1 O'clock, 2 O'clock fuck it do it late
Let 'em have it, let 'em get it right where you stay

[DJ Clay]
Okay I got you, it's over
It's nothing, it's easy, I'll do this I'm rollin'
If I don't see him then I'm postin'
Wait till he pulls up and leave him wet before he knows it

[Bailz]
Bang bang shoot 'em up that's the motto
See how he feels when his body filled with hollows

[DJ Clay]
Shells hit the ground and he falls to his knees
Hands on his chest and his back on the leaves

[Bailz]
Please I ain't worried about this bullshit
Can't think about it anymore, I used the whole clip

[DJ Clay]
You know I did let go, bullets rip blood flow
I don't think we gon' be hearing from him anymore

[Hook:]

[Bailz]
Real niggas do real things
Salute the fallen soldiers and the real OGs
I kill if you kill if you'll only ride with me
You feel how I feel then I know you'll die for me

[DJ Clay:]
Real killers do real things
Salute the fallen soldiers and the real OGs
I kill if you kill if you'll only ride with me
You feel how I feel then I know you'll die for me

[Verse 2:]

[Bailz]
I'll murk who you wanna murk, anybody can get it
My word, couple shot sprays on the curb
You got it twisted this is what he earned
Anything for the fam making bullets burn

[DJ Clay]
And I know what this dudes mama say (where you at?)
You got to go do this it's too touchy I can't
I'll text you his address, do it like magic
Make him disappear I don't want him coming back yeah

[Bailz]
Care less for anybody I'ma handle it
Black gloves, black mask, punk with the pistol grip
Ran in the house popped off, missed a few kids
Saw him running up the stairs so I put it to his ribs

[DJ Clay]
Okay I seen it on the News, they don't know who's the shooter
They said one dead and there's two others wounded
In daylight too, I don't know what you used
But the bitch with the mic said it went right through

[Bailz]
Shit, you know I had to dish that
It was hot, I loved that gun I had to ditch that

[DJ Clay]
You mean the one with the? Yeah! With the all chrome? Yeah!
The one with all those? Yeah! With the extended? I know!

[Hook]
