Hand me the knife (x4)

[Verse 1]
More pin than a pin girl
Long, thin, shiny
She my whole world
Has the power to bring me up when I'm down
Take a smile and turn it to a bloody frown
But wait theres more listen wait for a second
She'll take 20 knives Stab it and wreck it
Front, side, turn

(?) leave you naked
Hands tied tight, ball-gagged in the mouth
Go out and get three more and back to the house
Shit takes hours
Full time job but start with the (?) bitch-kabob
My girl cutting flesh

Bitch

She down for whatever
Old school as ever
When its time to do work hand me that motherfucka

[Hook]
(hand me the knife)
So I can spill some blood
(hand me the knife)
Soaked all in the blood
(hand me the knife)
The most powerful drug
(hand me the knife)
She my only love

[Verse 2]
I love the way blood drip down my bitch spine

Bright make my eye twinkle

Stainlesss steel

First 48 no confession

Toxic relationship, maybe
She never ever leave my hand thats my baby

But best believe I ain't tryna shed wood

And bask in the glory with my bitch, my dear

[Hook]
