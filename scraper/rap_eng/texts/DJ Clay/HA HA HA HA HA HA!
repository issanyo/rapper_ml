You said, I'm a murderer in a seed... Now why did you say that?

[Monoxide]
Woke up on the bad side of bed again
I can't escape this phase
Everywhere I turn is another wall
And the medicine got me feeling like I'm stuck in a maze
I can only find my way out by subtraction, murdering's my reaction
Look in the basement and you can see what I mean
People all cut to pieces, soaking in gasoline
I always knew that I was different from the start
Born with a black heart, addicted to pitch dark
I still don't understand why I'm so in love with killing
So I just sit and stare up staring at the ceiling
Hoping I'll get to take this jacket off
But not with all this crazy talk
Maybe I'll pretend to find my sanity
Or just embrace the fate that the voices have handed me

I'm laughing laughin' like a lunatic
I'm laughing laughin' like a lunatic
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I'm laughing laughin' like a lunatic
I'm laughing laughin' like a lunatic!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha,...
I'm laughing like a lunatic!...
I'm laughing like a lunatic! ha,...

Bloody bodies in the bathtub
For over two whole weeks and the smell is deadly
Pieces of their flesh fall from off the bone
And float along on top of the water like confetti
People in the basement cry cause they're hungry
And they want to be fed
Now I'm looking for replacements
All of the others that I brought em are dying or either dead
Standing in the parking lot of a shopping mall
With a "I'mma take one home" look in my eye
Moments later, driving home and I got it in the trunk
Everything is gonna be alright
Why did I get so worked up to the point that I thought
That I couldn't go through with it
When every time I do it the thrill is even better than
The first time that I ever did it
