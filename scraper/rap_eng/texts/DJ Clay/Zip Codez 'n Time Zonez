[Hook: Blaze]
Zip codes, time zones
Every other day a different state
But the juggalo love remains the same

[Verse 1: Blaze]
Everywhere I go I get love with occasion no mean mugs
But like me some of them killas ain't nothing
But straight up street thugs and bustin' caps
As a product I was raised like this short tick of a clock
So I dance on a 12 gauge and blaze up like the song say
Do you feel like they come at you the wrong way?
Come and let's the bullets sway
I killed them haters so only love will exist
This is all I have and on my time is invested in this

Zip codes, time zones
Every other day a different state
But the juggalo love remains the same

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Everytime I wake up, I take a risk of being killed
Everytime I sleep though I may suffocate up in my pillow
But there's haters in the woodwork jelous of my success
Mad, cause I help make scrubness kinda fresh
And the love we get is so much stronger than the hatred for us
It's scrictly family love waitin' at them backstage doors
Our people are like underground mafia network of ninjas
From the cactus juice coctails at campfires in the Carolina's
To the wet streets of London or behind the titty bar
Getting high with some juggalos and their funny ass looking car
This shit cannot be removed, these times are forever stored
You hate me's cause you're moppin' floors while I'm rockin' tours
Quit tryin' bitch

[Verse 3: Blaze & (Violent J)]
(I was runnin' with my hatchet down at beach in Orlando
See some juggalos cookin' scrimp in their sandal)
I was runnin' with the hatchet on the shores of Seattle
Juggalos bumpin' DL making the floor rattle
(I was deep in the smoky mountains and ran out of gas
Some juggalos came through even gave me few blunts out of his stash)
I was hanging out in Wooster, chillin' at the bay
Had too much to drink and lette drove me to the car
The road is my home, sometimes it feels that way
Rollin' on in tour bus for months and weeks, I can't complain
They show me love in every state
Like one of the greatest is my time
And on the ?C/sea? puttin' it down since 99 (eastside!)
I hope you understand I do this for you
When you ment to ride, to bump, to smoke, to come
To drink your fill and pick you up or let if you want to
It's all love

[Verse 4: Blaze & (Violent J)]
Ridin' through AZ stoppin' at 10P
Met a juggalo in the compton now I'm in southern Cali
(Passing through the town of Chicago I hit the dark streets
Listen at the darkest hour here I'm bumpin' our beats)
Out in New York city they'll be runnin' with the hatchet
Seen a juggalo rollin' blunts you know I had to match it
(High up in Colorado, mountains of the river
With 5 lettes naked all fucking and cooking dinners)
