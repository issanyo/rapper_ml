[Hook:]
Why don't you just let me be?
This is my life, let me lead
If you don't like what you see
Then you's a hater, you's a hater

[Verse 1:]
Why don't you leave me be?
When I'm walking all alone in the streets
Minding my business, doing what I do
Without always being stopped by some pigs like you
Asking me questions, looking at me rude
Telling me the music sucks that I listen to
Acting like they've got a right to hate
Without a killer like me dumping one in their face
Why don't you leave me be?
All I want to do is live free and be me
Smoke a fat blunt where I stand and not see
A bunch of fingers pointing because they smell good weed
Or be in a crowd without being a gang
Good times are forbidden if you look kind of strange
That's why I walk around looking to scare
Because I know you don't like it and I really don't care

[Hook:]
Why don't you just let me be?
This is my life, let me lead
If you don't like what you see
Then you's a hater, you's a hater

[Verse 2:]
Why don't you leave me be?
Or is it just because you like what you see?
I get a little hate to a degree
But fifty percent of those haters wish they was me
Why don't you leave me be?
And don't come around if you ain't family
Just walk away and let bygones be
Because if I can't see you then you can't see me
Why don't you leave me be?
Worry about your life and stop living through me
Walk in the shadow of your goddamn self
And try to recognize the one who needs help
Why don't you leave me be?
Acting like a pain because you're a disease
No one ever likes the energy you bring
So kill that hate inside and hope for better things

[Hook:]
Why don't you just let me be?
This is my life, let me lead
If you don't like what you see
Then you's a hater, you's a hater
