[Intro: Mortal Kombat Sample]
FATALITY

[Hook]
Niggas don't want no gun play
Cause I stay with the wretched
You fuck around and I clap it, I fuck around, let you have it
Niggas don't want no gun play
Yeah the twelve gauge shotty blast
Fuck around I leave ya hood full of body bags
Niggas don't want no gun play
When the shells come out the cartridge
Turn 'em all to targets
Niggas don't want no gun play
Yeah fuck it, lets get it started
Niggas don't want no, Niggas don't want no

(Whoooo Kiiiiid!)

[Verse 1]

You know my gun on me, cocked, locked, and loaded
And if a nigga want it, I will pot shot you homie
Threw away my forty, had to many bodies on it
Shotty wit buckshots spray your crew tryin to act hard
Get a nigga kidnapped, buried in my backyard
Guns in a dufflebag, Money out the bank drawyer
Bitches in my bubble bath, need I say more?
Capice? I ain't for gameplay
Fucking with these boys
These toys squeeze off
Fall back or ease off
Skully come down mean the ski mask on
When the fullest come out, it mean the beef back on
My lil niggas a damn eye witness, when its on, its on
Yeah we ain't giving no passes
The motto is if you flash your blasted
If shit get drastic, I'm burying you bastards
You know it's a rap when they throw the dirt on your casket nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If a nigga got a problem (we gon come for 'em)
Every nigga you see with me (got a gun on 'em)
And If you ain't got one (you better run for it)
Cause if not then ya dumb ass will be done for
Yeah its that go hard killer shit
Banana clip gorilla shit
With more bars than forty yards, harder than cement
Gun charge felon at large
Fresh out the precinct
Got a grudge with the judge so fuck what he think
Get money the bank truck and if a nigga move
I let the oozie eat 'em up
I let hundred round drum on the tool beat 'em up
Pushing the line, no easing up
Squeezing a nine, no freezing up
If I hit 'em up the coroner gone have to pick them up
Gang full of goons, you got to make haste stick 'em up
Tell 'em wave a white flag, fuck it we ain't giving up
My forty-four a nice mag
Nigga now what?
