G-G-G-G-G...G-G-G-G-G...G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT!

[Tony Yayo:]
You a half time hustla, im a full time hustla
[50 Cent:]
Cuz I stay on the grind, i stay on the grind
[Lloyd Banks:]
While you chasin your dick, I'll be chasin them chips
[50:]
Cuz I stay On the grind, I stay on the grind
Man, the D's on me, cuz they caught me with a nine
And I, stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
[TY:]
Wife be beggin, for me to spend time
[50:]
Cuz I, stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
All I do is sit and think of ways that I can come up
Catch you joukes and run up, and leave a nigga dun up*
My pockets i'm hurtin homie, I ain't feelin this shit
Have yo mama screamin "BABY MOVE! IT'S A HIT!!!"*
I ain't Scarface, "No women no kids" I dont give a fuck
Better teach that bitch and that little nigga ta duck
With a P90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive, you gon feel what talons'll do to ya*
I'm a hard-headed nigga, I came up so hard
Had to get shot 9 times for me to find God
If them planes hit the projects, nobody will care*
Look around, they ain't nothin but black folks around here
When brothas become political, and start to manuever*
They'll give you a hundred years man, they did it to Hoover
Ya, you can hate me or love me, when you see me bust shots
Or come and hug me, come show me she loves me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I ain't got time for love. I'm tryna get mine, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got more than a little, and I'm always gon shine, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call when I'm busy, when you got spare time, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I got cliental, I flip coke in a hurry*
Darryl Strawberry even called me on the celly
And Whitney Houston, so my coke be movin
I got the china white from this Cuban*
And my dope connects, a doofy African*
He got Boo-koo bucks, he be traffican
I know feinds that'll rob a train, to feed their vein
Feinds that'll kill an addict that support their habit
Feinds that'll pawn their jewels for dog food
So when I'm on the strip, you know I'm on the move
Fuck coppin a Bentley, wit low ass milage*
I cop ten bricks and pay for a palace*
Now theres coke in Atlanta, dope in Alabama*
I'm, not a rapper, Tony Yayo's a scrambler*
Remember back then, is when I slinged on the corner
I had the sheep skin, my girl had the leather bomber*

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I ain't got time for love. I'm tryna get mine, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got more than a little, and I'm always gon shine, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call when I'm busy, when you got spare time, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Dont get caught robbin the pot, 'cause your hand'll be tossed
And playin both sides'll getcha man buried, boss
I'ma flood the watch, and every cross
Nevermind the chorus, im in a Porsche, its my turn to floss
Don't put me in a mix of your rap lies
Diss me, Ill dip you in toilet water so you can get baptized
I grew up with the peasants in the halls
Elevators is broke, probably had asbestos in the walls
Now haters get reckless with the calls
'Cause I'm fuckin' their bitch and they buyin' breakfast in the morn
Not to mention, he dresses in the malls
New Prada footwear, X and O necklace with the bars
I don't care if you over 300 pounds, don't seduce me
You'll get your big ass cut up like Bruce Lee
I won't stop til my squad eat
We got tools, that'll spin your ass around like a 5 Heartbeat

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I ain't got time for love. I'm tryna get mine, and I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got more than a little, and I'm always gon shine, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call when I'm busy, when you got spare time, cuz I
Stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
