Woah-oh
(Hey!)
Wow-wow-wow-wow
(Hello)
Wow-wow-wow
(This is a revolution)
Wow-wow
Woah-oh
Wow-wow-wow-wow
(As we proceed)
Wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow

[Chorus]
I
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American, yeah (Salute me, shoot me down)

[Verse]
I swear to God I put the hero in heroin, these flows kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (Goddamn,) I know
I got a problem, I'ma take care of it, weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go
It won't hold me down no more

[Chorus]
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American (Salute me, shoot me down)

[Post-Chorus]
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, we ain't
Goin' nowhere, we can't be
Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, we ain't
Goin' nowhere, we can't be
Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life

[Bridge]
Back then I had a dream
I'd get this money, man
I know my life would change
Just need a hundred grand
Back then I had a dream
I'd get this money, man
I know, my life would change
Just need a hundred grand

[Segue]
Yeah
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Yeah, back when I first made a...
Yeah
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Yeah

[Part 2]

[Chorus]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand
(Let me get some money)

[Verse]
Yeah, okay, back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' something clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, they sayin' I'm the shit though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius
Sin everyday, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees
I'm the plug, what you need though? I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat
(Wait what?) I made a mil' before I paid a bill
Cause  fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL
Come with me, I can make your life change for real
Always had a dream of stuntin'
It ain't nothing unless we runnin' shit
Just a young motherfucker with a plan
Thought I was the man

[Chorus]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand
(Let me get some money)

[Outro: Elle Varner (Mac Miller)]
(Time flies) Let me get some money
Let me, let me get some money
(Yeah, you know time flies) Malcolm, can we go to mall?
I just need some shoes and my nails (Try to catch it) and then can we stop at Chipotle?
(Time flies) Let me get some money
(Yeah, you ever see the way time flies?) Let me, let me get some money
(Try to catch it) Let me get some money
Let me, let me get some money
