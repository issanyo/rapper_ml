[Verse One]
Y'all dudes be sick
We wilding after dark
Smoking on them thangs, body swings in the park
With remarks on philosophy and conversation spark
We kick on everything from y'all cats to how my dogs bark
I try to say something smart, sound stupid
I'm drunk out my mind, I can't do it
Cause I'm influenced by my homies
Who know me since the impressionable years
When everything I hear infected my young ears
Like the other night when we hung there
Tripping off beer I learned something new
About what I don't do but won't care
Disrespect the knowledge, streets is universal college
From a notty head professor, you just might be astonished
That's my bredren
Good friend from small children
That we was
Brothers by no blood I call him "Cuz"
From Gumby flat tops, dumb jokes and peach fuzz
Just yell when the bell don't buzz
Yo, son I'll be there with these when you touch beats no gloves
Just boxing
Show 'em what my massive's really made of
Oh excuse the yardy in me, chill back to love
Of my life, hood hanging there, hard rocking the club
(Get money, get booties)
I bet I be the richest and if not
You looking now, you took many mental pictures of my progress
The competition's harmless
I quote you
Remember those, it's not a joke duke, you're suppose to
Stick to the code, yo we all in for one
And I gots to get down or it ain't no fun
For real I love my niggas for every ghetto blessing
And every little lesson on how to live life

[Hook] {x2}
To my crazy ass niggas
Credit is due
Ain't nothing but love for all massive and crew
I don't forget nothing
From the new to the old
I'll remember all the times and I won't forget a soul

[Verse Two]
I ain't gon' front
Y'all niggas put me on about 'nuff (X amount of tings)
That gwan so I don't gwan like I'm tough
With all this rudebwoy stuff
I'm on some grown man plans with hands in real estate lands
To reinstate my real mans
Up in society
But bump that, son stay as you is
Just support your young dawg up in this rap and showbiz
Like you said you would
Over that back wood weed
If we all try to make it maybe one will succeed
It may be me and if so
Just make sure I don't forget
These days without no dollars, I won't change and you can bet
Up on the crew, Live And Stinkin', hot sweat getting twisted
We had our little somethings
And always shared and never shit on each other
I will stay my brother's keeper like my mother
Had you (and her other two)
Check the sentimental value
Word to me and you
All praise to God like true
But thank a small few
Mad credit is due
So yo, stick to the code, yo we all in for one
And I gots to get down or it ain't no fun
For real I love my niggas for every ghetto blessing
And every little lesson on how to live life

[Hook]
