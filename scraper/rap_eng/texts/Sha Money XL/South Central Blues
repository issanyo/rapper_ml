[Verse 1: Slim The Mobster]

Yeah, the way I grew up I be fuck up
It is 2 types of niggas the lickers and the suckers
Crack sellers weed puffer, this money can’t get enough of
But shit I got 6 kids and I can’t let one suffer
Streets got a nigga hard cold, it’s a motherfucker
Street play a part, you can ask the old hustlers
Cause they gang may change earth for me
Too far in it, it won’t look right for nothing
Married to the game so you gotta love it
All the shit I accomplish, gotta stand for something
If a nigga don’t acknowledge it, he gotta be fronting
I owe you no apology so we gonna stay stunting
And I’m probably on vacation with a lot of weed
Blowing money fast like I just hit the lottery
Hussle ain’t know me, nigga that’s part of me
Born to be a hustler, what the fuck you though I’d be?

[Hook: D-Brown]

To all my hustlers in the streets that don’t gotta be
To all the kids that wanna be what they see on tv
You don’t have to be on the block
We handle choice you got a lot, yeah
Don’t count bitch outta be that other me, that other me

[Verse 2: Slim The Mobster]

Yeah, I run the streets and that's how I grew up before the rap game came
Still made a few bucks, true we’re from the same place
But we ain’t in the same space
So far ahead of y’all like we ain’t in the same race
Nothing taken for granted, just learn from my mistakes
My will too strong, my spirit something they can’t break
Niggas want my position, but some things you can’t take
Praying that… for the name sake so
Never could listen to what they say
Praying for my downfall if they had it they way
Let them see me fall off nigga
But I’m too straight, niggas all they mad cause I’m everything you ain’t
New rims, new paint, everything
You think, you balling about a couple bottles had a few drinks
Listen to it without you
Shout out to the haters, I’d like to tell y’all thanks
