Yeah man
Fuck the hood man
Fuck that i been tryin' to get away from that muthafucker for a long time man.I'm happy yall niggas is mad man.Your frown makes me smile
Yall niggas know me man
It is what it is man
Like I say yall know me

I be on the scene on the lean on a benz in tha bently,when I come throuh your strip
Every trip every flip I get the grip
I can go to the dealership and buy me a new whip
Take fix
New kicks
G6
New tricks I pick to suck on my dick
G-Unit is the clique
And it's how it gets flipped
That's why you feelin' me bitch
Niggas hate from a far
But they don't come around
Cause they know how a nigga get down
Once a nigga move around
Wit a long trey pound
I won't hesitate to let it off 6 rounds
If yo ass get hit
Then you ain't do shit
Fuckin' wit me that's what you get
Now your lip
Keep it zip
Before you get your babymama
Caught up in this bullshit
Now what gets
It's a no no
Niggas on
Lo go
But they tryin' to stay on the LOE DOE
Gangsta fo sho
Every time a nigga flow
A nigga bank acount got
Mo' Dough
