[Hook]
Started getting money, now they love you
Niggas talk a lot like they about to
Mouthing negatively about me
I ain't gon' hurt you, nah nigga I'm just gon'
Rise above you
Rise above you
Nigga I'm about to rise above you
Rise above you
Rise above you

[Verse 1: Asaad]
Our Father, niggas winning, that's our karma
Live nigga, dead presi's is our sponsor
Street scholars, graduated from poor honors
No fathers, streets taught us to move smarter
I don't hesitate, I don't procrastinate
Geometrical symbols is just the master's taste
Something special, nothing less than immaculate
Italian engineering for the faster pace
It's level to this life, let me adjust to comfort
Sticking to the script like a funky drummer
Niggas at the top, I think they want me under
Insight be the key, I feel like Stevie Wonder
Rest in peace to Maya Angelou, your words inspire
Good could be better, my actions speak louder
I make mountains move, I make a genius think
My niece ain't even one and she's been seen in mink

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Asaad]
Face tattoos and I'm corporate
I turned a minus to a positive, I'm awesome
Hard working, I'm just learning to appreciate
Street semesters, hood collegiate
Motherly love, wisdom came from a woman
She did what she could, she did what she couldn't
Provided a way, just let me repay
I take extra heed to everything that you say
Bumpin' Phil Collins, I feel it in the air
I'm walking on air, floating on the snare
Niggas say they on they way and I'm just waiting on 'em
And I ain't plottin' on 'em, I'm praying for 'em
Take 'em to church, no take 'em to court
Restoring the feeling with effortless force
I set an example, I gave 'em my thoughts
My sister turning 16 and she deserve a Porsche
