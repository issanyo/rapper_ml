[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Let me take you back to high school, '94
When at least when a nigga had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, selling rocks on the way
Little bad motherfucker with a pocket full of yay
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ass
But she was too fast, and I was too slow
'Cause she wanted a nigga who already had dough
She found her a man who was like 24
But what she didn't know that he had plenty hoes
She was too young, so now he got a new one
'Cause shorty went and bought her a new gun
See when she catch this nigga she gon' do something
Not fight, but shorty gon' shoot something
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
Shot herself in the back putting the gun in her pants

[Chorus: Young Buck {with Chester Bennington}]
Live life young nigga, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, slow down, my nigga
{Slow your roll}, slow down my, nigga
Live life little mama, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
{Slow your roll}, you gotta slow down

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the Navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy
My nephew Shannon, 15 years old
When I think how he died I get real cold
'Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones
I was just home, with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket I need two of them shits
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seeing better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's fucked up, 'cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dying in the pen', damn

[Chorus: Young Buck {with Chester Bennington}]
Live life young nigga, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, slow down, my nigga
{Slow your roll}, slow down my, nigga
Live life little mama, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
{Slow your roll}, you gotta slow down

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
This can't be life, we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life, we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre, no morrrrrre
This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre
No mooooooo-ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrre!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Young Buck {with Chester Bennington}]
Live life young nigga, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, slow down, my nigga
{Slow your roll}, slow down my, nigga
Live life little mama, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
{Slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
