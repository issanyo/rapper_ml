(Tragedy)
Yo it's plain to see
You can't change me
Cuz I'm going to be a thug for life (2x)

(Headrush Napoleon)

Yo, ayyo Headrush blow up the spot like a nuclear missile
And leave your brain in flame like hemoiltissue
Off the handle with this
You don't wanna ramble with this
I kick rappers, ram them and beat them to shambles and shit
With a touch of class, every side of his ass
Saw straight though him, his whole persona was glass
Masking tape to create the desire affect
Pull out your fingernails where the pair of pliers direct
Sex on the beach
Nah, this is rape on the concrete
Oh you don't care yeah
Well your victim is your aunty
Is that a soft spot
Ya niggas is sweet like a cough drop
You ain't ready like a virgin
Trying to handle ____'s cock
I'm fitting to floss, pop pain
Piss more than it rain
Hold the world for ransom
'Til the lord put in a claim
For what is rightfully his before it's likely mine
Is double-o supernatural when I writing each rhyme

Chorus
My niggas bring war with this
You don't want it, you don't want it
Standing all types of heat
You don't need it, you don't need it
No longer will you eat
You live for the street, this boy fights for life
And we gonna show you tonight


(Tragedy)
Yo Mahdi, M-A-H-D-I
Live and Let die whether you Blood or Ã‘eta
Arab necktie
Do hits in daishiki
Camel Clutch like Goldberg move deeply
You heard of me foul Mahdi get left leaky
Prophecy El Khadafi, like Selassi
Black gangster, 2-5 rhymes'll fall
Bounce back like MJ, off the wall
Yo ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Triple-O, when you see him in the streets, blood rush
Yo platinum gats, scratched of serial numbers
Yo we gun runners, playing your hood with green Hummers
Shoot-out for two summers, in the winter, yo, we lay up
Hennesy straight with no chaser
Trial with the suede blazer
After the first hearing
Murder the witness like Eraser
Nextel with the Sprint pager
Yo, yo
You minor league playing the bench, we all major
Yo, Noreaga a.k.a. Nore-faker
Beat biter, rhyme style taker
Animaniac get clapped with foul gat
Send your whole skeleton back to Iraq

Chorus

(Tragedy)
Yo, yo
Thug for life 2-5 Arabian night
Till the world freeze over in ice, thug paradise
Be precise burn a Dutch down with Christ
'Til the Most High read me my rights
Blood type be those grimy niggas don't fear no man
Kill a nation with a wave of a hand throw their signs
Yo my insight enlightened with crime, lead the blind
Revolutionist, trap behind though enemies lines
Put one into his rib cage, two in his mask
Yo, Mahdi calico flow with black mask
Blowing holes in your expo, shatter your glass
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga acted up, first nigga get slugged out
You try to infiltrate my plan tried to stop my sales
Realize that a dead man'll tell no tales
No retreat, no surrender, we never forfeit
Yo, gorilla thug sending hot slugs up in your orbit
Gorilla thug sending hot slugs up in your orbit

Chorus
