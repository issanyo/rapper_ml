Right, right, right, right, right now, not now
Right now, not now, right now
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now
Right now, not now, right now

Leave me lone when I sip Patron
You gotta get home, but I rode the zone
Babe, so fine, can't even taste!
Hit the block and lean and start purple gray
Baby page me, you forgot to pay me
Who do you think you're playing?
Got my pimping from the 70s
With that lil magazine cover me
'got you sprung like young momma when she married you
Stop it!
Why you got a roof and you can't even drop it
Chop it, meet a hoe in a lobby!
Ro-ro-rose put a flow, pop a bottle, who shot me?
Off for two days, about thirty some '
Eight time traffic, didn't even see this coming
Knot in my stomach turned to butterflies (butterflies)
Never go broke, but the nigga still bumming
Flyer than your bitch dumb clubbing

I ain't beneath the play (I ain't beneath the play)
I'm the player to pay (I'm the player to play)
All black in the night (all black in the night)
All white in the day
She asked me, 'can you drive me out, will ok?'
Put my soul back in our Chevrolet!
Back to the town intoxicate
And I still ain't about to call it a deal

Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need a drink!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need a smoke!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need my girl!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now

Ange-Ange-Angelina, do you got the keys to the beamer?
Stich your guts, feel'
And the paramedics, what your leaders?
And I ain't even hop about the beamer
So make a right turn, na, na! Right now!
Pull up to the right style
Kick the door down, kicking to your door downstairs
Go into the drawers, caught her sniff your underwear!
Super weirdo, let me clear my (clear my) throat
Coogie and the Jones put some. in your home
Let, let me get it lucid, I don't usually
What you do to me is just cancer
I get this water on me
Part of me just stepping casually
Trying not to step the leather on my'
Get ghost up in this bitch like J-Lo!

I ain't beneath the play (I ain't beneath the play)
I'm the player to pay (I'm the player to play)
All black in the night (all black in the night)
All white in the day
She asked me, 'can you drive me out, will ok?'
Put my soul back in our Chevrolet!
Back to the town intoxicate
And I still ain't about to call it a deal

Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need a drink!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need a smoke!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
I need my girl!
Right, right, right, right, right now, not now, right now
