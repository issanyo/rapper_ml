[Verse 1: Reks]
Reks and Term, get your urn, get your hearses ready
Voorhees vs. Freddy boy we murder every beat
Giving heat, driven medleys
I’ve already severed heart beats and arteries
R to E King supreme philosophy
Follow me follow me pussy pardon me possibly
We knew AZ, Nas, Jay-Z, big bars
You spit charms then we split the walls and seas that part
Moses of flowers, focus them darts to heart stop
Till sasquatch feet, I repeat this is art
You are not psychosyllable, my lyrical’s top notch
Leap frog over y’all, hopscotch
We brought Sha Money for harmony, I’mma need y’all to promise me
Lots of accolades and praise for two rappers bringing it back
To back in the days minus the chains
The East need that king back so we came to be that boss
Reks and Term, it’s the Face Off

[Hook: Reks (Termanology)]
A deadly duo is a duo that can do it deadly
Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Termanology, the definition of horrific sadistic animalistic
Explicit vicious lyricism, call me cannibalistic
I will eat any rapper that got beef, you looking like red meat
And I got dinosaur teeth, I repeat I’m a monster
Running through the allies of your conscious
Catch you at your calm son then stretch you like a Charleston
And chew the way I do chew rappers and then I spit em out
This ain’t nothing I kid about, leave jizzum on your bitch’s blouse
I’m on a mission now, bullets, pistols, missiles, bloaw
Pull up with my chick, she’s wild, she’ll stick you, kiss you, kill you, wow
I’m in my shrink’s office plotting on a Brinks truck
It’s full of long money, Sha Money made this beat awesome
You want a face off, me and Reks already ready
My machete is deadly, it cut through your Pelle Pelle
So let’s battle, but you bring it, better go hard
When you hear that show off show off know your dough’s gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks & Termanology]

[Termanology]
Trust me they do not want it, I’m fantastic
Hop out a mini-van blasted
I’m trash, I’ll cum in a fan’s eyelashes
It’s murder masters, duo double murder assassins
Killing everybody, making money off of your actions

[Reks]
Hurt on enemy cats can send my sympathy passed as ministers
Sinister sentences I send em to ?
Pardon the bitches I’m vicious, lyricism jurrasic
Pencil and pad shit past these modern rap bastards
Politicking with Term, how we gonna earn?
These rappers getting shredded, beheaded, pick a new cranium severed

[Termanology]
Call a medic, I said it I mean I meant it
Depending on how much lettuce I get I will leave you shredded
So forget it, call the ambulance
Leave you looking anonymous like mannequins
Me and my Hispanic clique be on some satanic shit

[Reks]
Shit me and my conglomerate Dominic pencil prominent
Poetry, ponder ? to spit all you can do is honour it

[Hook]
