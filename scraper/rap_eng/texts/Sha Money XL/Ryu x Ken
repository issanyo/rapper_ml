[Hook: Bodega Bamz & Remy Banks]
Chapters of the same road, just a different page
We moving off the same high, smoking different haze
Either go to jail or we gotta face the grave
It's all about this money, dog, we in a new fade
I'ma die where I stand, I'm a different type of guy
Birds in the air, I'm a different type of fly
Where I'm from, niggas like to judge based off your supply
And they scared to show you love till they feel you 'bout to die

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz & Remy Banks]
Bye to the corner, you know I love tours
Bye to that bitch 'cause you know I hate whores
New women, new states, money coming different ways
Yankee pendant on the chain, you wasn't there, you can't relate
I remember, won't forget, it was year 0-12
Shows OT, still got it wholesale
Man, we had the city jumping like Supreme Clientele
New New York niggas, B, we like the Holy Grail
Chitty chat, fuck the chitty chat, fuck that
I ain't trying to bring the city back... Why Bamz?
We the ones with the massive plan
Why these fronting niggas pose in pictures for the 'Gram?
They pussy? Don't forget we was there from the gate, though
I sold coke right before I went to Santos
And sold out, so let's talk about alumni
Acid on my tongue, I was dead high

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz & Remy Banks]
When the Fair and the Tan link up, they can't deny it
Pockets looking slim like they on a liquid diet
And I know it ain't right for me to swear to God
But I swear to God, I'm the best with it, dog
Man, you know we got the recipe, dog
Shit was written in stone, we on our own, we defying the odds
And I know it ain't right for me to talk shit about them
But I swear, shit hurting me, dog
Tan flag, with the gold around my neck
Everybody show respect when I come thru, chiefing on the set
I done came thru for [?], I done came thru to humble
I done came thru to come thru
I came in like a dad, I'ma son you
When I draw no R, fuck a Sun Tzu
Me and mines got love for you
You my blood, I take a slug for you, talk to 'em, nigga
