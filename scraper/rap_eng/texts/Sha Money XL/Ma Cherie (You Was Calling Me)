[Hook]
You was all on me, telling me I'm stressing you but
You was calling me
Helping you with all your problems You was covering
I been on my own and it made me different ever since
Cause you gon let me in I mean I know you considering
Thinking you and me together a make sense
And I know that you need your space that I'm convinced
I never lied I told you that I wanted this

[Verse 1]
I been fuckin round with different women
And fuck whoever
I plan to take you anywhere you wanna
No thats my baby
I loved you from the start now baby lets be honest
No need for convincing me
Cause anytime you loving me there ain't no options

[Hook]
You was all on me, telling me Im stressing you but
You was calling me
Helping you with all your problems You was covering
I been on my own and it made me different ever since
Cause you gon let me in I mean I know you considering Thinking you gon [?] it make sense
And I know that you need your space that I'm convinced
I never lied I told you that I wanted this

[Verse 2]
Told a chick I wanted this but I know she wanted that
Baby father said he gone, he ain't never coming back
And I know that nigga wack
How many years with this nigga
I had her from the start
The baddest from New York
I ain't wanna leave when she was here for a nigga

You was all on me
Girl you was all on me
You was all on me
