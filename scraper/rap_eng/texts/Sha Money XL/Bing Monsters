[Ja Rule]
Drummer drives me
In the bing doing flat three
Rather rip a nigga for rap than fight to be free
That's just me
Ja Rule inevitably
Living the lifestyle that get most niggas shot down
I'm in now
And only niggas thrown from tiers gon' touch ground
Seal his lips to silence the sound
I drop on niggas heavy
And all of my bing monsters is ridin' ready
Benchin the weight of Chevy's
Ox is like machetes, for when it's
Poppin'
Y'all niggas get to cuttin'
My niggas get to choppin'
Aight then
I'm a "killa" with the hyphen
Kill-A
Motherfucker before he kill me
Rule nigga, the Cae-sar
Spittin' razors
This killer Queens bing monster is

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain

[Headrush Napoleon]
The white man's justice
Be the black mans grief
Animal instinct
Abnormal canine teeth
I earned my black heart for props to hold turf
Go down on a V.I. ox your whole earth
Make it pop at church service
While you're lying to God
We bring drama
Get it on with the entire riot squad
Ain't an enemy of mines
That'll step in my house
Cause the CO's is my hijos
And they settin me out
From Clinton to Coxsackie to Sing Sing daddy
We eat high hoes
Juice and jack mac patties
If not probably arroz con godbody
I got a one to three
Rockin with niggas biddin bodies
Never was a dead nigga till I reached them bars
And I earned the doorag gem stars and keloid scars
For y'all

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Triple O survive or die
Canine rise with wolves
Sneak thieve your dorm, and walk on all fours
Locked in the mountains
Niggas'll lose things
Like they manhood
Hung with shoestrings
Faces disfigured
Disgrace these niggas
Run 'em out of the house like Replacement Killers
Cowards playing the towers
Loose powers
Won't last an hour
Get aped in the showers
Bing monsters come through and bust you
Guerillas extortion
Strong arm muscle
Drag queen kill a fiend for thorazine
Take they blood oath and form they own team
Niggas spittin out razors
Fiend for rangers
Locked with a sumo thug in small cages

[Tragedy Khadafi] (3x)

Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
