VERSE 1 - Jake Palumbo

Big dreamer, small business
'88 Beamer, heat seeeker, tall Guiness
I am living on the edge of panic rooms & busted windows
With a mustard colored jumpsuit
Seducing younger womens
Spend my days in the basement avoiding the super
Cornbread, peach tea, burning sour, eating grouper
Spiral out the staircase leaving on the creep
Sometimes I wish that I was dead, just to get some decent sleep
Time to pay my loan shark, Hudson & Horatio
Cigar bar owner with enforcers on the payroll
Emeralds in the headphones, exchange manila envelopes
Handshake agreements, my pops taught me to honor those
Move in total silence, so I'm never like "your honor", though
Ostinato bass line, copped a box of Optimos
Cops is like the Octagon, choke without a care
In the lab I'm Dr. Octopus, engineer extraordinaire

HOOK - Innocent?

Look - I don't know what these motherf***er's expect
You carved your name in this game, they gotta show you respect
Traveled across lands, demand they cut a check
You so up to your neck, might light up a cigarette
(And you don't even smoke...)
They say you insane in the membrane, & yep
There's a couple screws missing
But homie ain't done yet
I make you a bet that the day before you go
You get a million-dollar check in a manila envelope

VERSE 2 - Jake Palumbo

Smash pumpkins off the necks of dumb fellas
Country bumpkins buying guns at Cabela's
Switch the vehicle cause they memorize your patterns
Rap is lackluster, never memorize your patterns
Snooping neighbors, overdue favors
But if I'm on the clock, then there's food on the table
My mood is unstable, sampling Dave Brubeck
Dance like I'm crippled with palsy, I can't two-step
Cripller crossface, true story -
I sold Chris Benoit groceries in 1999
Before I ever sold a record, before he snapped & went gory
Met my idol as a teen, the Wolverine said go for mine
Bumped my head a few times
Suffered two concussions
But cracked $80 Thou on the strength of my percussion
Last year, JP Midas Touch, Golden Ear
Old enough to know better, young enough to see it clear

(REPEAT HOOK)

VERSE 3 - Roc Marciano

Ghost guns from the Philippines
These white b*****s is feeling me like Ryan Philippe
Whip a blow-up in the kitchen, this s*** is chemistry
It's risky business, we did wickedry with the chicken feet
Switching V's, $50 G's is chicken feed
We in a different league, I cop my ice from Tiffany's
Drive-by's in the Lotus, the 6-speed
The 5th will bend your knees like Christopher Reeves
Getting the breeze is just routine
My shoes from the boutique
They cool as Kool G, they run a cool G
Just copped a new blue SUV
We don't lose sleep
Was a jewel thief
I popped the tooly at your booty meat
Play your position, I'm playing mines
I'm playing God, you could never take the baton
My young shooter Juan he from San Juan
Said Duece was on the arm
After he blammed your car, he died his hair blonde

BRIDGE - Innocent?

What do you do when your back is against the wall
And you're down so deep, no reception to make a call
All you got is a couple of bags of raw
Brown liquor, one mic & a button that says record
Second hand got me high as my first toke
Don't even think Travis Scott come equipped with the antidote
Dungeon of rap, these chains will never be broke
All because of C-Notes inside manila envelopes
