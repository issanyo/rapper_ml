[Intro - The Alchemist]

Roc Marci...
The Alchemist...
Oh No...

[Verse 1 - Oh No]

Ayo
I'm on heavy medication 'til the room's spinning
Feels like I'm being escorted by some naked women
Each one pulling my arm
Who wanna make it happen?
They say the flow is retarded
Give them a straight jacket
A dark hallway, little room with the wall padded
Automatic lock on the door
That cause some more panic
But I'm more savage
More like K beast on ravage
Ain't nobody safe in this known planet
This is the first step to your [?]
The season of the sickness
I hung 'em like a brother lynching
You ain't got enough heart to satisfy my hunger
Not enough bath salt to survive this up and coming summer
Cop body camera routed in the corner mounted
[?] smack your faces like a quarter pounder
All I need is at least four quarter ramps
Daily [?]
You can find me on the corner bouncing

[Verse 2 - The Alchemist]

Pimping out of retard jacket and hope fashion
Smoke a stick of the sherm, burn it and go grab it
Locate your coordinates then I boat map it
Locate the foot on the track then I toe tag it
Your weaponry's for show it only blows confetti
I'm Crazy Eddie, blood crust on the machete
Work out wit the iron and leave the metal sweaty
Bullet twist out the pistol sound like a kettle's ready
I'll tip over your tea pot
Clicking like Doug E. Fresh with a beat box
Got 'em in lke a restock
Chop down rock and pump reebok
Push off your likkle soldier
Lick off and catch a speed knot
Plastic man with a cannon
Know how to stretch a bitch
Blow the bazooka let it pitch, fillet the escovitch
Fix the trigger to your neck, display the excellence
Fix your head or get force fed this medicine

[Verse 3 - Roc Marciano]

Enough said, black Kangol duck head
Touch bread, jump it off in Buckhead
Smoke bus head
Fuck your buzzard on a plush bed
Protect your nest egg
Rock Vestments on the bed spread
Late night caress legs
Up in the Double Tree, with subtlety
My young b, pussy hug the D like a muscle tee
Shuffle, from out the truck let off a couple
Respect me like ya uncle, open you like a sun roof
Raise the bar, each bar leave a razor scar
Praise Allah, hold the K like a guitar
My car's up to par
My Audemars blacker than tar
That's bizarre, the pad that's a Pathmark
Man handled, my hairs is the English Channel
On cool nights sport the flannel
Turn weight like a door handle
My pen flare that's a Roman candle
Keep toast fuck a bow and arrow
Lord, load the work in the mini van
With the semi in hand
With the Mac-10 indian dance
As the Pyrex glass boil
Smoke the weed laced with hash oil
Wrap the crack up in the foil
G status, keep cabbage, flee to Paris
Feed you to the maggots with no baggage
Smooth operator, pop the eight and left a crater
And stepped off later in the gator
It get's greater...
