[Intro]
Uh, check it...
Marc, nigga
Uh, for niggas that don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
Who you lovin?
Who you wanna be huggin?
Who you wanna be wit kissin
Takin pictures in public?

Who you lovin?
Who you wanna be huggin?
Who you wanna be wit kissin
Takin pictures in public?

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Swiss movement on my wrist, I'm suited
Canoodling with bitches
This is what I've been doing
Shit I'm doodling with the pen
Cause the room to get humid
The Mac 10 came with air holes coolin
School's in
Nigga, this tutoring
You should pick up a few tips
There's loot to get
Gotta watch who you in cahoots with
My niggas shoot shit
We don't shoot the shit
I might smack you, loosen your gibs
Off of orange juice and gin
This is true ??
Putting ?two on a ten?
The Benz is two door
I just had on an orange suit with Timbs
Stole your bitch
?We like orange juice in the rain?
You ready to cut up the credit cards and everythang
I know the blasted difference between
Club Monaco and Ferragamo, ho
Solid gold from hollow
The white bitches, I'm like Fabio
She said I reminded her of Ralph Macchio
(Bitch buggin son
I look nothing like that nigga
Bitch I look like God)
She prolly let your posse know
My flow cannot be copied
I got a patent on it
My wrist is splashin'
It got platinum on it
For that I think there's some grass in order
(Thank you, thank you, thank you so much)

Safe to say a nigga that came up
Made enough to get the game up
We came and stepped on the yay
In the name of love
I'm a grade above you blood
Get your weight up bum
Keyboards hating from West Bumblefuck
Niggas hating from West Bumblefuck
Enough is enough
Might pop a bottle on this rare occasion
Blowjobs from models
We know where to take it
My bitch hold the hammer standing naked
My young'un knock your head off for a pair of Payton's

Facts

[Chorus]
Who you lovin?
Who you wanna be huggin?
Who you wanna be wit kissin
Takin pictures in public?

Who you lovin?
Who you wanna be huggin?
Who you wanna be wit kissin
Takin pictures in public?
