I, speed in the whip, huggin the road
15 in the clip one in the hole
You ex-posed when it's a code
Miniature chromes shimmering is it gold?
My bitch skin got a cinnamon tone
The lyrics I wrote this song unlimited grove
The livid is coke, any nigga try to approach
Gettin a hole like Gillighan boat
Dance on the edge, put a couple grand on your head
Keep the rubberband for the bread
Bundles of 'tars, out of the sun roof of the Porsche
Thought that I was humble til' I fault
I'm from the jungles of New York, Mr. wonderful
I'm like Paul Longdoff
I'ma warlord my benz got four doors
Nozzle on the pump shotty got sawed off
So when is time for the drama
The llama and revolver and not the nine limer
That I keep in the line of the ........
To spark it if conspire man my departure
It's such a beautiful death
I'ma righty but could shoot with the left to shoot a tech niggas feudin to death
Is either that or you could use a gillette, uh
Sharp like a suit in a vest, c'mon, c'mon

Scarface, nigga
Thousand dollar suits and boots
Bulletproof coupes
Got a lot of juice still sippin that grey goose
But still put one in your grape's fruit
Oop, it's all about the loot
Niggas'll hop up out the hoop and then shoot
Uh, and then shoot, Scarface

Yo, what I scribble in the pad is magic
Flesh is tatted, lessons are added
To the tablet, in arabic, my narrative
Smoother than Pistol Pete Maravich
You just an embarrasment to rap and for that
You deserve a javelin in the back
Bum ass niggas know the business
My glow won't diminish, not a bit-it
My flow hard to mimic like Giddish
Still one of the best spitters, admit it
Sex symbol, I'm like what Brad Pitt is, to bitches
Songs play out like motion pictures
I'm making a movie out here
OG I feel like Big Tookie out here
I'm the dookie out here, you boony out here
Smoked out looking like Pookie out here, yeah
White gold flooded Virgin Mary
Mercenary, burn a ary, turn a canary
Dirty Harry swervin' in the Caddy
Servin' that Mary and Barry to Cat Daddy
Bally on, my bitches stallions
Black medallions similar to caviar
To carry arms in the tarry car
My ......, got more karats/carrots than a salad bar

Scarface, nigga
Thousand dollar suits and boots
Bulletproof coupes
Got a lot of juice still sippin that grey goose
But still put one in your grape's fruit
Oop, it's all about the loot
Niggas'll hop up out the hoop and then shoot
Uh, and then shoot, Scarface
