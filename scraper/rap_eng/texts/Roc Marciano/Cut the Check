[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah... This is all our turf... Warriors
Won't let them niggas slick us with their slickery
Paying money to the coroner
Them old 'blah blah blah' niggas is boring ya
We glide on the scene like Gumby nigga
Estafan, Gloria
Will it be all over in the morning?!
Fuck that nigga, cash is calling
Keep me breathing
Like nigga in the morning keep your teeth white
Right from under your nose, master thieves
Carti on the trapper still snatch the cheese
Two G's green and green
Go hand in hand like cookies and cream
(Bum ass niggas)
That's pussy and cash rules everthing around me
Cookies and cream
That's pussy and cash rules everthing around me
Cookies and cream

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Cali weed and swisha
Laying on the fishnet on the beam with Melissa
Keep the lean in the pitcher
Potent green with my team in the picture
Catch ya queen in the shitter
Might sacrifice ya bishop
The motif's never show teeth
Snow beast level o geese
We put the coke in them streets
My old shit is heat, I'm currently at my peak
(Top notch!)
Trial by fire
Pliers something thick like Mya in a choir
The fiend wore a wire
Word to Lil Rock
I serve crackheads little rocks
Niggas gangbanging out in Little Rock
Black skully in the summer
Dumped a hundred out the Hummer
Sound like a drummer, newcomer
Go hard like the dream in the paint
Niggas think it's a game but it ain't, I'm saying...

[Hook] (x2)
Dough in the sweats
Sippin' on the Moet
Niggas know what I rep
Bitches blowin' the head
Yo cut the motherfucking check
Go cut the motherfucking check

[Verse 3: Quelle Chris]
Cake out the bank like a bakery
Bread rolls out that bag that they stuff for me
Lex-o seats heat up so comfortably
Head from hoes, head honchos come fuck with me
Jeeves... cut the cheese
Cut the wine ma, the moolah
Six stars... big cars
Big body... big sparks
Big heart artichokes with the cigar
The [?] on the roll always make [?]
We living large, getting ours
And give it back to the titty bar, it's yours
We make it rain, Dustin Hoffman
Dust him off man, he was a boss man
Big Slauson flossing like the Baldwin Hills
Ball point skill, James Bulger
In the hills with the tall thing, dark skin
Blonde [?] hard licks
Woke up and my brain was doing Mark Spitz
Mo' money gotta get made
And you know me I gotta get paid

[Hook] (x2)
Dough in the sweats
Sippin' on the Moet
Niggas know what I rep
Bitches blowin' the head
Yo cut the motherfucking check
Go cut the motherfucking check
