[Verse 1: Tree]
Different superstitions, my newest Coupe is missing
This roof and its cruel intentions, it's zooming through June in Venice
It's never too relentless, it's only you too intensive
My toolies are few defense men, I own it like Gucci symbols
Got my newer henchmen, my old ones reduced their sentence
Down to a year or so, now he want true repentments
Can't blame him, can't blame him, want better things
Twenty fifties, ten fives, but I never drink
Hustling since a shorty, since a shorty I've been hustling
What the fuck? Fuck, fuck niggas I ain't fucking with
Mommy got foodstamps, money from the government
Papa told me never fuck a bitch if she ain't sucking dick
The dirty bitch, she doubles it, do everything, she doubles it
She knows in your ammo, yo, you know what the fuck I meant?
It's crazy, crazy, had me in a hazy
First they say I'm awkward now they talking they gone pay me
Mama used play me, scratch all tickets like men, if that don't get it
She never got it, she's get it and I'm older, colder
Pockets getting swoller, if I never do nothing, mama see me in a Rover

[Hook]
My bitch is terra-cotta
I'm on that Aristotle
My grandma play the lotto
Trying to win

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Cold summers, hot winters, God's with us
The truth's hard to swallow like cod liver
Mom J-cup, sharp shape up
Get your cake up, lift your cape up
Switch your pace up, gym starts, split your face up
Then hit the taste up, spray your place up
My DNA and make-up, it's bake up
Cut the Korean steak up
Won't take a pay cut
Flip the gray truck
Stick it in your gut and hit the lake up
Vicious imagery, Lamborgini cemetary
Geese and hennessy, thick bitches from Tennesse
Let you tell it what you telling me, you celery
It's elementary, [?] melodies
Pleasant memories, it's necessary, B
I spend my nights in the telly like Ron Jeremy
You better G then better G
I twist you like the letter G
So if I said it let it be

[Hook]
