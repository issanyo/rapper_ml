[Verse 1]
Shot up the golden rock to hit the rover spot
Smoke a lot of pot like Prop Joe on the co-op
My hoes got blowjobs too cool to ball, I might slow jock
I get you robbed, you move to Omaha
Ain't no hoes in my bios, [?] only the co-sign
I let foes dry on the clothesline
My whole styles remind me of bovine
About to start my own clothing line and be multi
Don’t play both sides, you get hit and left by the roadside
My lady knows how, I'm a snob
I'd rather do crime with the mob than punch a time card
Your body pop out the drop like a pop tart
Nigga, don’t ever fix your face to front
We eat fake gangsters for lunch, to wet my taste buds
380 snub leave you rubbed, I had on rubber gloves
Just for pumping your gums, you got slumped

[Chorus]
My head is in a Bonneville
My head is in a Bonneville
Fill you up with copper, you should stop and chill
Pop a pill, get your wig peeled

[Verse 2]
Danced with wolves, learned a couple new dance moves
Your tunes Nation Lampoons, my new sedan's maroon
Might need a hot air balloon to get a clear view of my hairdo
These squares are rare heirlooms
Muggs provide the backdrop, I crack your top and apricot
Then laughed off your plot to sabotage
Every half a bar is worth a Jaguar
As for Mar, what's on my arm's out of MadameNoire
You buying caviar Pathmark, you marks ain't even hit the halfway mark
I'm like a young Hasselhoff, satin drawers, Michael Kors velours
Hopped out the 4 door like Boston George
They gentrified the game, that's when the God came in Cartier frames
I sprayed your frame, you changed body weight
Sacrifice you, then come back with rifles
To end your life cycle in a fly Nike boot, motherfuccker

[Chorus]
My head is in a Bonneville
My head is in a Bonneville
Fill you up with copper, you should stop and chill
Pop a pill, get your wig peeled

[Outro]
Kaos
Straight up
