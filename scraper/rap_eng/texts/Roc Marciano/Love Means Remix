[Intro]
What's life about?
You don't go through it as a man's man
You should suck it up, take the fall
Do the time
That's made you who you are
That makes you what you are


Semi Six

As I jump out of planes over Belize in the Fall
Perform a combat roll just to even the fall like Steven Segal

Im rockin’ amethyst chains coppin’ cannabis strains
I can assist dames
With takin’ they clothes off in closed loft
Got blowed off
Hit it and dozed off ona gold cloth

This ain't rap these are lucid dreams
Im sellin’ baby powder to stupid fiends in humid scenes
You fall short

Im a stalwart sellin’ what yall  snort
With twin queens sippin’ Jim Beams ona ball court

Im a trackstar with his strings tied
Sippin’ Jack Daniels with black damsels, ring side

I drove off in a clean ride
And fiends cried

Sean Rosati


I’m eatin’ pop corn watchin’ PAWG porn
Postin’ my music all up on these blog forums
Watch the cops swarm from this god born chop form
Once the album drops I ain’t gon’ stop tourin’

I gave the cock to tina drinkin’ aquafina
Copped the visa then flew on a jet stewardess wet
Groove on the set boost the effects soothing the vets
With jewels that I flex with unusual techniques

I’m up in the mix luxury whips
Ladies with the lovely tits and buttery hips
Im in a classic corvette with a ratchet whore wet
I trashed her corset in the forest next to the road

Morse code on the orange robe
Tourin’ the globe under the foreign strobes pourin’ poems
Morning strolls on the beach scrolls of my speech patterns
I reach Saturn while you keep scatterin’ it’s flatterin’
