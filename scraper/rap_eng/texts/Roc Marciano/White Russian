[Roc Marciano]
Grinded shimmer
Mind like an organized crime figure
Pot slinger
Rap's George Steinbrenner
Million dollar rhyme printer
White wine sipper
Fly slipper
Big time flipper like Guy Fisher
Silencers on the 9's whisper like a shy sister
Banging iron till the palm blister
Still the flyest
From my shows, hoes steal the flyers
I'm to ill for you to kill a virus
Look in the killer's iris
The size of holes left in you like a silver dollar
My how to win mind is filled with knowledge
Mine field around the cottage
Fuck how you feel about it
I am trying to fill a wallet, until its brolic
Knobs get polished by the most exotic hoes
I promise my Benz got leather and oak inside it
Coke measuring, no consignment
Cause when you was broke I find it hard to remain open-minded
Hoping God there is a road for riders
That Live by the code and honor
That don't end in molten lava
I know a lot of hoes that gotta game of tricks like globetrotters
To give good dome with the saliva
Dipped in Prada
But who am I to try to knock her
For ballin like a nigga bagga?
Back deposits
Foampots is still wearing copper, proper
Rock you to sleep like a toddler boy
Almond joy
Nuts to a full-time mama's boy
Death ritual
Farm McCoy
Play the trucks like a Tonka toy
The boy's moist
I pop you up for a small coin
You caught four in the groin, one in the loin
You made a noise, I stay poised
Corduroys
Till every pirate on board, ahoy

[Melanin 9]
? kiss a plutonium lip
Bell skip
For ships of opium grips of polar shift
Shotties explode disks, running from a solar eclipse
Snipe your pawn out
Forces combust when planets fallout
Submerged in dirt, while bowels orbit like a dusty vinyl
Lost sluts who crave fucks with holographic titles
? hugging the sidewalk
...
Stuck in depressed chambers
Ropes hanging from death's neigbors
Fruits are stain and unflavored
Mind frames plague with speculations
Algebraic equations
...
? through a hard drizzle
Shizzle Bars of crystal
... darkest tissue
Third eye is my farmest visual
Sharpen knives to slice pythons in the garden
Sacrifice the science sarcem
Diaphragms of ?
? marksman
Tears skies with solar flares
Farces a photonic glare, in subatomic sphere
Standing ovations at satan's enreighnment
Chunky shells of uranium
Compose and aim again
No faith, gold chains that choke veins
Boats and planes
Blows comatose your brain
Young boxed in the twenty ton slum
Eleven guns, elegant suns
...
Accurate aim
Cramp your frame in accetate
Lapped in acid rain
Cock the hammer with fabulous range
Like maximus pain
..
Nikel-potassium
Immaculate metallic amulet
