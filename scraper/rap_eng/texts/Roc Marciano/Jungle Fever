[Verse 1]

Check it
Yo play the graveyard shift for chips
Stay dipped in the whip, different day same shit
Duckin' the dicks, hugging the strip, puffing the spliff
With, niggas who wanted to shine and get rich
Like Mitch when I first met the bitch
I admit, wasn't fit, not a dime she was more like a Nick
Said she came from the Bricks, til she came in our midst
Our crew broke her off she was buying us kicks
When I cut her she was butter, white bitch from the gutter
Had to hide you from my mother cause you didn't have color
Not to say my mama prejudice but, a devilish slut
Wasn't gonna be in her crib blessing her son
But, dressing me up, she definitely was
Lo' shit dragging, soda club jackets
You got the whole package
I could just wrap you in plastic
You's a bad bitch, Jungle Fever

[Hook]

You know her name, the rich man's aspirin
Some say she's, really what's happening
Some dudes use her for satisfaction
Others use her while they coolin' and maxin'
Me and my bitch it's like Fatal Attraction

[Verse 2]

Check it
I stay loyal, wake up in the morning, cook for you
Boil you in oil, hold you tight like foil
From turmoil to dirt soil
Kept me afloat like a surfboard, been in turf wars
Squirt the fours, pigs had to search for us
Some got merked trying to cuff my bird
Wasn't much on words, big bucks you earned
Got your weight up now you firm, money to burn
Nigga's jealous of me and her, we infer
Trips OT the bitch chose me
Black Brad Pitt with Angelina Jolie
Your family's from overseas, fuck with OGs
Like Cooley High star Cochise
Known to diss the rock like Mo' Cheeks
Often try not to OD, hitting that raw, won't sleep
Put my face in it, taste exquisite
Jungle Fever

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Worst drug you my first love
Mama told me you was trouble but
On the first hung we double up
And when it's cold out we bundle up
And when the summer come we shine like a couple [??]
Custom trucks, big butt sluts, love us
Watch for 21 Jump, big money to touch
Fuck 20 bucks putts, paper cuts on the thumbs
Eighty thousand in ones, make your fingertips numb
Income dumb, Steak A1, Purple haze for lungs
You bisexual you like thugs
You bitches that hang out in night clubs
Ride [??] like paparazzi, Watch me flash lightbulbs
They watchin' us from high up
We had our run, now my times up

[Hook]
