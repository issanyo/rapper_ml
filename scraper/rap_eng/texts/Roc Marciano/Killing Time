[Verse 1]
Might spot me in the mocha roadster
Something bad up on the corner
My white hoe standing like Anna Kournikova
I called her over
People pointing, "Yo there goes Rosebudd"
All my clothes is bought with hoe's blood
Rollin bud in the button up
Bitches button it up
You see me and the homie here bustin' it up
Crunching numbers over suckling duck
I was stuffed, the wine was robust
I rolled a blunt up
My presence embodies wealth
My wrist rocky, not Versace belts
The white, got it from Rafael
Pockets swell, I got the intel
From golems out in Roswell
Now I got more rides than Jerry Seinfeld
I'll cut your wive's tails, it's no old wive's tale
Stable's filled with clydesdales
Brazilian bombshells to quell all dryspells
With top shottas, get shot up by a pot of oxtail
The Caddy passed
The scallywags can't carry my calf Bally bag
My bitch young Halle bad
Something a real mack would marry, she got the fat [?]

[Hook]
I try but I, I don't want to live a lie, why would I
Goodbye ma, we had a good time
I know I'm a good guy
Maybe somewhere down the line, if you're still fine
But for now I'm just killin' time

[Verse 2]
Damn I'm fly, flying in from Panama with tan lines
Might paint the S5 camouflage
I was handed a baton
My feet was in sand in San Juan, female companion
I stole her from her man in Club Zanzibar
She got more bread than Roseann Barr
The answers was in the stars, she said my hands were soft
I parked the Phantom
She said her old man's a Neanderthal
Babydoll was in thrall, we indoors
No gulps, sips of Cristal, it was in the crystal ball
I was wearing Christian Dior
The fortune teller showed this to me when I was a little boy

[Verse 3]
For this trail of broken hearts we like ocean sharks
Composing art, black Mozart
Make the pussyhole fart
Vanilla ice cream, cookie dough parts
No need to cook for me
Yo ma, just know I'm goodie mob (I'm Good, ma)
Fuck you with all my jewelry on, my wood's a chili dog
I'm killing these whores, my crib look like a minimall
Just bought a Bentley, I'ma get me 20 more for all my dogs
I feel like Boston George in Michael Jordan shorts
Water sports, need more passports
To Europeans I'm like Hasselhoff
When you see me: hats off, then pass the torch
Fuck all the back and forth, I'm clapping at your boss
For tryna tap the source your thoughts will turn to applesauce
