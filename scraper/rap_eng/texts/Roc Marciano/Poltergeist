Uh
Yeah
Mars nigga
Word
This that coke music nigga
Straight up, powder your nose
Baby, uh

[Verse 1]
Carbine out the window
Process the info
My chest is a igloo, your flesh is a menu
Cold nigga, icicle
Sinful, I saw my image in a ball made of crystal
Hallucinate off a 8-ball
Your mackin' is inactive, I brain storm
Your parade's rained on
I skate the shady Liz Claiborneâ€™s, you wife the kind of whore I run a train on
Lavish attributes
Rose gold be like apple juice
Alligator boots, Persol sight
But hold the light like poltergeist John Travolta nights
Dipped the po-lice twice, gotta hold tight
Crack the jar
Cut the top, drive a half-a-car
And float like a raft down the Cazbar
Diamond dinner plate
Accentuate; you insinuate
I sip the grapes and split the steak
You shave a snowflake off the cake; (now)walk straight
Im only here by the lords grace

Yea
Yea
Uh

[Chorus]
I feel blessed, any nigga come test
Could catch one in the chest
Momma knows best, he's a guest, I'm squeezing off of reflex
Still keep the heat under the ski-vest and rock a clean v-neck
My team we a threat, we rep, I'm just trying to get my feet wet

[Verse 2]
Steady hand, sniper aim
A white flame; microwave the game, viper grey
Light a J on the stairway
My lady lay in ??, my jewelry is hand made
My tears are champagne
I whipped the range in the rain in Spain
Shived in the rib cage
Lift the gauge, similar to Nick Cage grade
I persuade in suede, talk slick in silk
Seduce the kitten with the milk, without guilt
Your milf kneeled up in the vanderbilt; I killed it on the quilt
My wrist look chilled, uh
Sip the nectar, shit is extra
The "M" emblem the reflector
The beast squeeze the milli or the Winchester, as a gesture
My view is that of Hugh Hefner
I've yet to find a smoother texture in a pimp's dresser
Motherfucka

[Chorus]
I feel blessed, any nigga come test
Could catch one in the chest
Momma knows best, he's a guest, I'm squeezing off of reflex
Still keep the heat under the ski-vest and rock a clean v-neck
My team we a threat, we rep, I'm just trying to get my feet wet
