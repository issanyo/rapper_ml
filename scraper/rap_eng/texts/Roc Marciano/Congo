[Verse 1]
Cherry drop top Lotus
I bury these cockroaches
Leave your rassclot top open
I had to lift the Glock with potholders
And put away your pot hold lyrics
I've been told where the pot of gold is
No shit, it's not where the rainbow ends
Swizz Beats Bally's with the feather
Any bitch that meets me
That's a happy heifer
The heat be in the Ac Integra
The jacket's leather
The mac, how you tweak it like Max Headroom
I ain't done finessin'
This a test run
Hit you in the neck then
Left the gun in the restaurant
Yves Saint Lauren tee, extra large
The vest, Kevlar
That's a hell of a bar
KY Jelly in the jar with your broad
I had to beg Allah for a fresh start
These niggas is a dub, boy
The Air Max 97's, the corduroys
Word to mother, you null and void
The pump made dumb noise
It had a brother running from the boys, hot summers
I give you this work like you unemployed
I just copped another toy
Spoiled like a new little bundle of joy
You bums couldn't touch a coin

[Interlude]
You won't get [?]
Shit ain't got no cut, boy
Trust, this is [?], this is just, boy
You niggas is a dub, boy
Trust, this is [?], this is just, boy
You niggas is a dub, boy

[Verse 2]
I play the [?]
Vanna White on the Rambo knife
Bust the hammer, give the handle a wipe
First like to help with animal rights
Gotta be careful
How dare you go gamblin' with your life like
Like it's a handful of dice
You better off tryin' to dance on some ice
And some Nikes
I'm winnin' by a landslide, dike
Thirty on the waist be the pant size
Cock the nine back like a handjob
The brick [?] came from Panama
Eighteen, the timepiece
This is Panerai
Bitch, you just par for the course
Fuck what the car cost
Put the money on the dark horse
I can get the order to you hard or soft
Your lady still gonna suck it if it's hard or soft
That's a fact jack
It's under the Snapple cap
I had to be a pharaoh in the past
Snatch the all black Calico out the stash
Win the battle
All you seen is the barrel and the flash
Uh, uh

[Outro]
These niggas is a dub, boy
The Air Max 97's the corduroys
Word to mother you null and void
The pump made dumb noise
It had a brother runnin' from the boys, hot summers
I give you this work like you unemployed
I just copped another toy
I'm spoiled like a new little bundle of joy
You bums couldn't touch a coin
