[Chorus]
Life is so crazy
Shit don't come easy
Gotta get it
Can't be lazy	 (Gotta hustle)
That's just the way they made me	(That's how I'm built)
That's how they made me
(Yeah nigga)
Pray for me (for me)
Pray for me (baby)
Pray for
Pray for me (baby)

[Verse 1]
Used to catch the train to go to cop
Uptop, all I wanted was that gold 745
? 	? boy
While you was waking up for school, at 7:45
I was bagging up
Trying to catch that early morning rush  (It was slow, too)
Crack tore the fam apart but
It paid for my first apartment, yup
Used to have to play the back then
Now I’m frontin'; on some Rosa Parks shit
Flashy nigga, Rucker Park shit
?Talk shit?...
Diamonds flashing in the dark shit
I'm a marksman
Just a guppy in the shark tank
Bitches love me, send me heart face
While I, do a, hunnid, on the, park way [?]
They don't want no funk
They don't want no Parliament
They don't want no part of this
They just wanted to play the ?armpit?
They was fatherless, it's no bother, kid
Ain't no harm in it
I’m trying to scratch some horror off my karma list
Well if it don't, you just know I'm sorry then
Just know how I see it I'ma call it pimp
(That's all nigga)
Just know how I see it I'ma call it pimp
Fuck the corny shit
The Rollie 40 cent
Plus all the homies that you saw me with, they all with the shits
Do you greasy dog like some fish n' chips
We not the same cloth, this a different knit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Where I'm from you get your shit knocked off
Drop Porsche, get your top off'd
Pop a 44 like some popcorn
In the hood we poppin offa cop cars
Put in work but I ain't punched a time card
Shit was live, we survived wars
Worse than the Lords vs. The Tomahawks
I put trademarks around your eyeballs
Niggas ain't street, try the sidewalk
New Glock, filled it up with hollow points
Your body found rottin out in Baltimore
Scotch over juice
Rocks sold loose
Pops told the truth
Knock a hoes boots, now enjoy the fruit
I'm ?bipolar? too
?High roller but I don't own a suit?
I'm just grindin' for my loot
I'm just trying not to blow my cool
Watchu mad for?
Watchu Macklemore?
Shop in thrift stores?
Whatchu bitchin for?
Whatchu wishin for is my downfall
How I'm living, shit is pissin niggas off
I should put you on instead of push along
Put you on songs, Play the hood more
You should pray for me like a good boy  (Pray for me)
Pray for me like a good boy		(Pray for me)
Post toys all Polaroids
Of course we dopeboy posterboys
The life that we chose
Nights that we froze
White that we sold
This is all real no lies being told
I'ma stay fly and knock me a ho

[Chorus]
