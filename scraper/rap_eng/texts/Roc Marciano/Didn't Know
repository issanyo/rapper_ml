[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Yo... Bring the gauges
Cocksuckers send their praises
In Rod Laver's
This shit is hard labor
Scarface behaviour
The three eighty it came with the laser
My bitch from Malaysia
Send the pimps legislature
Finger fuck the mac out the Range Sport
Twist and retort, this couldn't be taught
It's instinctive
The minks is distinguished
Just look at what I do with this English
The Roll's roley look pinkish
Thick R&B bitches fingered
The scent of sweet pussy lingered
Trips to Syria to meet the criteria
Bitches saw Arie without India
Crack the vent, my flatulence stink
My afro has kink like an African King
The Jag is for the spring
The money's in the back with the string
I'm like Tony with my arm in a sling
That's pretty like the cash look, half black foot
Supercat, shot gritty out in Flatbush
No Bruno, my neck is cold like Pluto
Let a few go out the coupe... Uno

[Hook: Roc Marciano]
Still getting bitches if you didn't know
Spent the meal ticket if you didn't know
Real nigga if you didn't know
Kill niggas if you didn't know

[Verse 2: Freeway]
The best bearded rapper, bearded trapper
As I pull through these bearded naps
Create these bearded raps
Like I plotted retaliation, the beard is back
They want annihilation
But I won't let hip hop die for nathin'
Incarcerated scarfaces in the staircases
Turned to tight jeans-wearing niggas with the queer faces
It's an oasis of gay shit, I can't take it
And rappers with no content, I'm out here with no favourites
My akhi said "You need to be deenin' and building businesses"
"The rap game frauding and ignorant don't save it"
But I feel partly responsible, see these rappers I raise 'em
My son doula's my illegitimate babies
And if they [?] they gon' blame me
If you got to jail can't blow the L
When they revoke your bail, wearing funny shit real
These youngers know how squeezing the toast feel
But don't know how cloves smell
Three eggs and grit shit
For where everyday is halloween and every night is mischief
We mask up to get shit
They act, I really live this
So I really got the right to spit this
In the [?] with his chick
I'm her favorite fella 'cos I made it out the ghetto, I'm gifted
And whenever I visit, you know I keeped the metal cocked
There really is killers on every block

[Hook: Roc Marciano] (x2)
Still getting bitches if you didn't know
Spent the meal ticket if you didn't know
Real nigga if you didn't know
Kill niggas if you didn't know

[Verse 3: Knowledge The Pirate]
Went out young with my friends
Leave 'em leaking or jumping a fence
Take the gun
Wipe off my palm and my prints
Stay calm and not tense
Then go see a major event with my ladies and gents
In that grey Maserati with tints
Feeling like Gotti, everybody wanna get a glimpse
Paparazzi out here taking flicks
Tryna capture the moment
We pour out liquor and send our condolence
Kill all snakes, rats and rodents
We mask up and we murder with motive
A game of death where you kill your oppenents
Seventeen shots in his flesh was inserted
We sent a message how we shot up that niggas suburban
Hop in the Maybach and drew back the curtains
Two shooters and two hoopties to cause a diversion
Left the nigga dead in traffic murdered
Uh, we shoot shit up
