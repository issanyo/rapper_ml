[Chorus]
Do-re-me
Fa-lo-sa-ti
Follow me
So crazy
Don't pay freaks
The hoes pay me
So wavy
You know, baby
Oh
Oh
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby baby
? ?
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
? ?                (Marc)

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Check it
The love outweigh the hate
Accept the fate
This came with being great
It's all balance
It's give and take
I'm in a good space
Rolling with the wood face
Might spray bait
Put up in good faith
I wish you pussies would say my name
Get your frame flamed
Shot, thrown out the plane
You die trying to hang on the wing
My lady ring
Was made by Vera Wang
We all make errors
No whore can make me jealous
Bitch my taste is exquisite
If you feel you equipped to bang
Then take the quiz my nigga
I bet you fail it
I bet you get your head split like a melon
Ain't no tellin
The flow is credit
But the game is sold separate
Made cocaine more famous
Than the flavor known as peppermint
We came up
Life's like a episode of The Jeffersons
My man brung the Tec
He snuck a weapon in
You tuck your necklace in
I'm just settling in
Yeah, I said we was pimps
Everything that I said I meant
I'm a man, you a bitch
So we can't settle this like men
Niggas is kids
Niggas still taking pictures of they kicks
I might take your bitch
Just for kicks
The fiends is mad I came late with the fix
I should have won the chip
But it was fixed
The shit went down without a hitch, Slim
Bullets whizzing through the brisk wind
Chipped your wig
Cross my team and
You can't live to eat a chicken wing
I'm trying to cop
The Beamer Six
Before the spring hit
Fuck what you thinkin
Stinkin bitch
Marc nigga
What you thinkin
Stinkin bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Did my dirt in the streets
Gotta learn from mistakes
Stand firm and squirt the .38
Or turn the other cheek
Swerve in the V with
Different color schemes
They seen us coming
I'm becoming a
Young Phil Drummond
You still my son and
Death is in the tongue
Soon I'll be done beloved
Shit was a dub
These bum niggas a dime a dozen
Rhyme bustas (hot bustas)
Ridin buses
Shots from cocksuckers
I might pop you and
Hop in the Cutlass
I don't give a squat
If its topless or covered
As long as these young foxes
Rocking pumps
And try to jump in
Copped a truck to make punches in
I hit the block and punched in
My hoe took a couple bumps
Off a hunded slip
Not every nigga with money's rich
?You lucky prick?
It's either get bloody or plug me in, ya dig?
No funny biz
I leave pockets with
The Bugs Bunny ears
Your career's doing the running man
? ?
Used to go hand in hand
Was hungry like a wolf
Duran Duran
I come put one in your deriare
(Yeah, Yeah)
Uh
I come put one in your derri√®re
(Yeah)

[Chorus]
