[Intro: Roc Marciano]
Moments like these make it all worth it
Yeah, baby
Huh, Marc, baby
Yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Countless nights heard the sound of mice
Runnin' through the white rice
Now we Tom Brown down with the stripes
Here's some sound advice
Niggas don't even sound right
From slingin' powder, I was tryna get out the life
Kind of like Supafly, my heart is ice
My future's bright, but I can't see it through the fog
At times you question if you believe in God
I was shown a sign, but it wasn't in the sky my guy (uh uh)
Nah, ain't no love on the block
They say love is blind, but it's not
It's in my son and mother's eyes but none of y'alls
My bitch smell like Chanel No. 9
Who can you trust when everyone just want they ducks in line?
The drug game dry, these younger thots got butt jobs
The lye made my eyes bloodshot (bloodshot)
I bust shots from out somethin', butterscotch and what not
They love the Louis jacket color block, I'm a juggernaut
I was knocked with the rubber Glock but it wasn't mine
The D.A. looked the judge in the eyes and lied, bottom line
My lil' sly from Harlem shot her in the thigh (pah)
To write what I scribe means spending time on the wild side
A leap of faith is needed to learn how to fly (fly, baby)
A leap of faith is needed to learn how to fly, nigga

[Verse 2: Knowledge The Pirate]
Shit was sweet once I swooped off her feet
Out in BK at the Barclay's Center, front row seats
Gramercy Tavern, eating at Philippe's
We used to be 'bout chicken, but now all we do it beef
She was witnessin' me whippin' up that feast
Took up diamonds in her ear when I flooded my Jesus piece
Trips overseas, exotic V's
She's erotic with that pistol how she cock and squeeze
Put it on the block and she move the D
She ain't fuckin' with them ops cause she loyal to me
Nine in her purse, forty Glock under the seat
Drama and beef put blood bottoms on her feet
Yeah she chocolate, but ain't nothing sweet
And she quick to pop it (pop it)
Never out of pocket
All about her profit (profit)

[Outro: Knowledge the Pirate]
Yeah, baby (yeah, baby)
Here-Here's a few gifts for you, I mean, shit, I mean, you earned these, though, baby, I mean (you deserve these)
Aw, don't start the cryin', baby, I mean, you know, shit, you know, this is just equality, baby
I mean, you deserve all of these things, baby, you earned 'em, work hard
