[Intro]

Oh shit, oh shit!
Yo look outside son
You see that?
Damn son, it's comin' down right?
Ok
Let's go

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

Yeah, yeah
You played the art of war like a chess champ
The wrestler's camp, let's give the man a hand
He used to go hand to hand by the gram
Take a brick and then grind it to sand
Baby girl, my 45. don't jam, Al Pacino wit a tan
Ghetto Casino, rollin' c-lo wit Vito
For nothing under a c-note, nigga, we still reppin' the East Coast
Reaching for toast like TV remotes
Spray cans where graffiti is wrote
And where the media promotes so I appear like a genie in smoke
And for me it's so easy to boast, even when I'm greasy & broke
In a pea coat
And this beat here's good as meatloaf
Better yet a pot roast
Gettin' block close, if niggas need dope
The hits out, better you then me first
Nigga do your research, you'll be six feet beneath dirt
Promise you this much, I'm out for the big bucks, Mr. Big Stuff, get your shit touched
Keep the 45th tucked, nigga kiss butt
Whip a Benz truck, siippin' juice from a pimp's cup, huh
This is money rap, run a hundred & twenty laps
On the track, it's a money wrap
Blat!
Brothers scat, do some jumping jacks
Brothers put out a buncha crap
Now they perfect for tax

Let's go, finesse the flow
Fresh dressed from head to toe, let em' know
On wit the show, we used to play the corner for dough
Rain...hail...

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

Me and my niggas had dreams of riches
Bad bitches wit mean figures, keep the green twisted
Squeeze biscuits, underneath the money green Discus, 2010, hits and mischief
Juggling Jum's, bubblegum
Cum on her tongue, the color of rum, it's the return of the fly bum, hon
Maybe it's just my radiant flesh or the baby tech that wet up a grey GS, yes
Place your bets, till I get to taste success, rappers to me are just a waste of breath
If they can't take a threat then pay Flex out the Avirex
Snakes for pets
Eat a rat, spit out the head
Single handedly rip, you and whoever you wit, level and peddle some incredible shit
Run in your kennel once the kettle is lit
We'll beat you wit the metal clip, firmly legit
You Kibbles & Bits, bitch

[Hook]

Let's go, finesse the flow
