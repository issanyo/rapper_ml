[Verse 1]
Sittin' sixes
Get money bag bitches
Repetitious, I still dress pimpish
Thousand dollar trenches
Bitch I'm down in the trenches
Crocodile bound with the lenses
Beige car seats [?]
Close the deal shit is concrete, grease
Pompuos, rock the watch with the compass
Fill the pockets, I feel accomplished
Fill the goblet, rhyme philosophic
Trailblazer, keep the [?] on retainer
You know we players when it's winter rock layers
By the way I never met a hater with paper
Simple math
Draft, this is witchcraft
Cast the spell on the thick glass
With mad class, hopping out the crisp Jag with the rag
It's a raft
Bitches come get frapped
We own hoes like items
Got titles, bust 9's at my rivals
To make it final, 5 lines to the sinal
S550s with the driver like Prince Michael
We fuck bitches on they cycle
Me against me is Prince vs. Michael
Empty the rifle, live trifle
I'm not the type to wife you
But it's cool for you to slide through

Chorus

[Verse 2]
We was walking on sore feet
Your crew was 4 deep
Just bought the V, I dropped the bread crumb, foresee
40 Gs upon a [?]
Victory is foreseen
The porsche jeep is forest green
Animal attraction, secreted passion in the magnum
I'm laying like bait in the contraption
Slow jam to Michael Jackson
Flyer accent, my back got the tiger scratches
Spare no expense on the trench this is relevance
40 below, skin the elephant
Slick sweater, million dollar rhetoric
Trendsetter, make bitches celibate
Ex drug dealer, crack, I used to sell a bit
Sex healer, fly bitch therapist
Pimp, you can tell I'm in my element
Yeah, bitch

Chorus
