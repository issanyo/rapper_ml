[Hook]
Truth or dare
For niggas that’ll shoot the square
Yeah, Gortex, got a few pair
Bust a move, make a shoe tear
Take off your ear like a souvenir
Swing from the chandelier
Richard Gere with the gear, Ric Flair
Yeah, squeeze clips in the brisk air
Split your pear for the wristwear
Yeah, the kid is a pistolier

[Verse 1]
Yo, diamond choker
We bonded at the Ponderosa
Islamic culture
Put the copper in the toaster
Pot smoker, drive the Rover with the silent motor
Mama, I’m vulgar
My persona got the fly aroma
Catch me on stage
Rapping in Jamaican accent (Bombaclot)
Bang a actress from Moreno to Anglo Saxon
Display the axes, twin nickel-plated ratchets
The rainbow roll is radioactive
With a tramp, daddy gallivant
Break the marrow like an aloe plant
We came gallant in the caravan
The Smith & Wesson be the mallet brand
You tend to extend the olive branch
All my niggas hustle digital scales, Cazals
The fish scale, color Kevin McHale
Lift the veil where the pelicans sail
The black Mac 11 is held
You either go to Heaven or Hell
Motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Tighten the knot
Nights at the dock
Shot at the livestock
The top of the thermometer pop
One monkey don’t make the show stop
We plot over the stovetop
Sip Coronas, lift the Dakota with the shoulder stock
Mozzola popping the pan
Pop a clan, chop the tan
The king’s head was propped on the stand
Feeding at the Garden of Eden
I’m a heathen
Two fifths of my bitch cleavage
It’s the completion
Script a jewel sitting by the pool
Mate with the Goddess
Light the chronic with a flame from a comet
Plant the seed
I’m limping like Willis Reed
Move at a pimp speed to bend trees
The little dream make the triple beam lean
Lit up a stick of nicotine
Got me ducking ten speed and Ben Vereen
Pen the text
Pinky resting in crystal meth
Tickle the trigger with the index, press
