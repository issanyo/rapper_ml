[Verse 1]
Let the sawed-off rip, tore off your hip
We draw the 5th, we don't forfeit
Talk shit, they find you 'round tortoises and crawfish
Your bitch up in the morgue all stiff
Pardon my awkwardness, the pump long as shit, ooh
Life's like a jungle, not a jungle gym
Played with guns, we once was kids
Now the Benz white like rice from Uncle Ben's
Peep the layout, used to bring the cane down on the greyhound
Hoes would play me, now my Bally kicks is made of baby cow
Don’t make me pull Stacy’s out
My heat will never push the safety down, it’s all gravy, pal
You know how we play
We pimp the bitches into the grave or to the crazy house
I’m made, it ain’t just a-ok to take me out
The hitter had to be sanctioned by Gabriel
I have angels around, wear chains with nasal on the kitchen table
The 4 limb sable was maple brown
The cape hang down, for you to relate, it may take a while
Y'all some real live victims, niggas is straight jive turkey
With all the fixes, you get burned and then we murk in sixes

[Break]
Fuck niggas
Ayo, the nigga, there he go right there
Pull over, pull over, pull over
Y'all already know, nigga
Just pull close

[Verse 2]
We CEOs beat your feet, ho, 5 Gs spent on my peacoat, my bitches deepthroat
My speech is dope, just a needle poke could be considered to be a lethal dose
I do you something medieval and gross
I just flow the people spoke, my toast sound like the Migos
My pistol like it's Clicquot, my Rollie pin gold
Fingerbones with stones, my cologne alone 800 bones
I don't need to say nothing to hoes, looking self-absorbed in the Porsche
Fire lines, they thought I wrote these songs with a welding torch
I'm back in my bag of tricks, I'm back to scratch the itch
You haven't had a fix 'til you had this, got 'em leaning off the talk
My tall thing like Lena Horne in just leotard
Feels good to be in charge, push European cars just because
Give you the blues, blood, but you not cuz, we true blue bloods, bruh
Ruined my lungs, I smoke so much they thought I grew bud
I'm ghetto like my name Junebug
I was thuggin' when it wasn't cool to move drugs
Fool, I used to think school was for chumps
Now I'm in Bermuda by the pool with the trunks
Books by the bunch, just to think I was a crook once
