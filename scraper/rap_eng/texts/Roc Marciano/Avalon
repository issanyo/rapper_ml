[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
A fallen soldier in Avalon
The hidden meaning
Trained in the shadow pawn
Waist deep, baptized in a shallow pond
Upon the chariot, chop it like shallots
Could have said salad, the bullet and the ballot
My chick bad laid black swan, grip a challice
Full of fine wine, full flavored
Layered in tradition, values, customs
Must grow apart and let the world grow accustomed
Let him think he won, see the truth it might crush him
Flustered, I plant seeds, let the wings grow
Trying to sand down my horns, I hand down a warm welcome
A heaping helping
Feast with my niggas belching
Two bitches from Belgium we never heard of
Belgian waffles you awfully mistaken
Lawfully unwedded to this paper that I’m making
Banking, I’m brave enough to be creative
But I acclimate like a native
Trying to blend in with the cadence
Abide by the rules, fuck the latest
Trend, I just came for the accolades
Spend more time on important shit
Self improvement, this money sorting shit

[Interlude]
Crowned prince, nigga
This shit’s beautiful my nigga
Well said
Let's get back into it and get lost, motherfucker
Straight up
Get it fucked up, nigga

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
The watch is swiss, the rhymes, these are hieroglyphs
Glide from a cliff
It’s rare I fire and miss
I usually hit the bull’s iris
One shot, kill out the six-fifty hybrid
Sex magic, Inspector Gadget jacket
Snatch cabbage out the cabinet
It’s orgasmic
A soft fabric rabbit
Assault weapon, a course lesson
Court in session, my aura’s florescent; orange
My origin is gorgeous
Whores around the sun orbit
Fellatio with fallen angels
The angles tell you put the hit on dangles
Got the game in a strangle, my three chains get tangled
Break bread at the table
Break down a quaalude, break it up
Wooden jewelry niggas fronting
You’re not conscious
Where I reside is at the top of the compass (North)
Vocally, I hit different nuances
You talking nonsense
Chant the incantation like a witch doctor
My bloodline’s brown like a mudslide
My corpse turn to butterflies
Family man, slash pimp, live double lives
These are troubling times, nigga
