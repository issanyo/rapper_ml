[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Yo
Yap the coke out the caine vitamin box
Sippin' [?]
A coach is very different than a playa
Nigga my grandma house smell like santeria
You pussy, I ain’t know you was a chica
The zig-zaw hit ya v up
You hit your grow house for a hundred thousand dollar black fatima
My grandfather had to leave her
You hope nowadays try and hit you in the shower with the zika
Make a fiend kick a hole in your speaker 'nuff machin de, to hit your car door with the fifa
Teacher, teacher
We don’t need no education
All we want is Nicoles and Teresas
Fuck around and get your head wop
Some niggas do the snake some niggas do the running man when shells pop
Shell tops without the shoelaces when the bell drop
Guys getting shot with thorazine in the cell block
Y'all niggas had the first down with the rat fur
I had the Canada goose, get fount in the trash sir, bachelor
East Solomon with the coyote
We arguing we sneak the margarine inside the bogies
You smoke that by mistake you get crack high
Matlock, we tryna solve the case, but it’s a rat eye
That’s why we splash the border lace up in the cash spot
That’s why
Fuck nigga that’s why
