[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, fuck you thought, boy? Uh
You already know what we doing, boy
King shit, shit, uh, uh, huh, uh

[Verse 1]
I flood the shipyard, you rap subpar
Fuck a roof, why cover the cars, white like a Dove bar
Park the double R, pull your trump card
This hog's 300 large, front on the guard, you get dumped on
You tumbled when your number was called
The 40 long calls, you do summersault, dog
Don't worry, lord, the summer's all yours
The pump still up under the London fog
The horse is imported from Portugal
My songs is like soft porn
Pouring Pourisons with tall Amazons
Black Panameras, Tony Montana standards
Scramblers is scanners in the Porsche
Grams is soft, we used to scramble on the porch
For what a Phantom cost, I blam at your thoughts
Transport snort, so raw the shit snowballed
Got bowling balls for balls
My redbone whore, she like Charlie Baltimore
We up, my dog, check the scoreboard
The crib four floors, you know we in this for the long haul
That shit I'm on

[Chorus]
Uh, that's that shit I'm on
Roll the window down and hit 'em all
That's that shit I'm on
That's that shit I'm on
That's that shit I'm on
Roll the window down and hit 'em all

[Verse 2]
Huh, uh, yo, lime green Gallardo
I'm like Marlo without the scar though
You know how karma go
The AR strap go over the collar bone
I bone fly hoes in Ferragamo
My shine still glow from behind a blindfold
Rock the frozen manteca, the Rollie Skydweller
Uh, they crashed the Regera on La Cienaga
All my lines is like cinema
The tool shot derringers close by, I feel like I'm John Derringer
Uh, all my clothes is Italian cut (Italian cut)
Only fuck with bitches if they down to fuck (Uh)
My shades a thousand bucks and up
I got a Russian plug, I get you plugged (Plugged)
Your heart'll stop pumping blood (Uh)
Get fly for the hoes in the no fly zone
Copped the R Seven Quattro, y'all don't drive those
We fly fly hoes to the Galapagos with white gold ropes
To keep 'em right, we get 'em lipo'd
Aight though

[Chorus]
Uh, that's that shit I'm on
Roll the window down and hit 'em all
That's that shit I'm on
That's that shit I'm on
That's that shit I'm on
Roll the window down and hit 'em all
