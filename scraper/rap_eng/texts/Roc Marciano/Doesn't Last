[Verse 1]
Money come, money go, black Monte Carlo
Niggas set the bar low
With the tech nine and the set cargo
Slow the cargo, it's escargot
Was taught never let your cards show
Hold the Roscoe
Niggas told the cops, now the spot's blown (we out)
Robberies with the costume
Send shots at your top phone
We tycoons, my nigga, we are not coons, not cool
Thousand dollar croc shoes
Sliding in 'em,  living like a Yakub
I'm out in Yemen, you nibblin' on dry food
Crab rappers don't wanna frack us
My back is like B.A. Baracus
Smash ratchets till the shaft of my penis is flaccid
This is classic, I'm thinking past G Wagons
Mink draggin', Supercat "Cabin Stabbin"
That's what's happening
Jacket made of calf skin
The light that I'm basking in, remember shit in on
And you don't quit

[Hook]
It don't last, baby
It never did, it never have, baby

[Verse 2]
Your raps small change, coin of phrase
The Ralph Lauren shit I'm sporting, this is oil base
Your whore coil like a snakeskin
It's like Watergate skipped the court date just to fornicate
Warpaint face, your mixtapes done in poor taste
I'm watching horses race, court made
With the quarter to eight
Slipped your whore the bait
My shit is more than great, what I orchestrate
I just want my niggas to all be straight
Cause where I often lay it ain't coffee cake
Used to book niggas for chains and leathers
Cook 'caine, now I grab the wood-grain in the seven
The game is a lesson
My breathren got knocked for possession after I was stressin'
Move with discretion
Peace to Mexican niggas that carry weapons
Big butt bitches in leggings and 54-11's
Smith and Wesson's, I capture the best essence
Thirsty heffers ass pass the refreshments
A fresh prince
Wipe the hammer down, I think I left prints
Nigga
