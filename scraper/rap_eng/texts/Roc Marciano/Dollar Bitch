[Intro]
(Black Italian mob bosses
Ragazino, Marciano..
Sicily..)


[Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]
Illuminated wise men, Bombay sapphire gin
Im'a monster leviathan
In restaurants with the mandolins and violins
Sweet serenade, fresh squeezed lemonade
We toast lady marmalade, aveck ma' vulay vookoshay'
Russian roulette
Any given Tuesday my shooters will come too spray
Orchin?, pop corkin, fried alligator, Japanese porcelain
Divorce him and fuck wit a real nigga
Steal ya bitch like Tony did Frank nigga
Closet lookin like sneakavilla
Sneakavelli bowtite killa
Master ceremony, Masta builda
Protractor with the G centered, Senior
Rizzuto family glow
Aura like i owned a Ch√¢teau in Bordeaux

[Hook: Maffew Ragazino]
Black mob bosses
Mushroom Tortellini soup awesome
Pale horses, inverted crosses
Who said gangstas ain't gorgeous?
? , world dominance
A nigga all about a dollar bitch
Short patience, low tolerance
Call me when its bout' a dolla bitch!

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
(You know the mothafuckin office hours bitch
9-5 Monday though Friday...hit me)

Uh the message is esoteric
Its in the game that i inherit
Cherish, the weak perish
I squeeze and release pellets
Communicate with bee speak with the ferret
Twist the vanilla call it BO Derek
My cologne go smell it
Rose gold necklace
Deceptive, foreign model
The car thats a foreign model
The Porsche steering wheels fondled
And left the dime' mind boggled
Hornswoggle, the young leaner whore swallow
Milano like swine flu
The rhymes got swine flu
Word to mommy got the wallys dye blue?
Uh, fly triplex, tribecca?, the trifecta
Was blessed to a quiet nectar (sip it)
Fire extra, a wise lecture
And let the Heckler and Koch quiet the heckler
Tech N9ne neck tie, for bread let fly
Specify, cut through your vest let flesh cry (Uhhh!)
A fresh eye a guest spy
Ive yet to leave a chest dry

[Hook]
