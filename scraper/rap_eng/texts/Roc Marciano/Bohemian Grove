[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh
Lay back
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, this some shit my old king would fuck with
[?]

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Two D's for a double dose
2s and Ds on the Dan & Dean bubblecoat
Tools squeeze
If you want smoke
We can mix it up and make gumbo
The snub nose Muggsy Bogues
The Calico Mutombo
Niggas talking all this mumbo jumbo
First rule of thumb
Keep it a hundo
We still live by them old teachings we don’t love no hoes
Those are cuckolds
Might have to go and flood the Rols with bloodstones
Holmes was thinking Puffy Combs
I'm eating lovely, Trust me
We live comfy, we don't have money woes
Knew I was gully since a youngin with the runny nose
Even though we drove here in luxury it was a bumpy road
I had the pump, it feels good to have company though
I'm comfy ho
I'm in my underclothes
My location's undisclosed
Yeah, this is black-owned, this ain't dough the crackers loan
Your flows won't pass the acid test or pass for gold
I blast the chrome
All you see is ass and elbows
The straps on the Margielas is velcro
The fire for the metal melt the snow, I got stories, bring marshmallows
The fire from the metal melt the snow
I got stories, bring marshmallows

[Chorus: Knowledge the Pirate]
Listen
Food on the table, coke on the stove (yeah, whip that)
Secret society, Bohemian Grove
We took five fish and five loaves
And fed five-thousand, I guess I'm like Christ I suppose
We drove hoopties up the bumpy roads
Now we pull up in foreigns on them bumpy roads
Listen, yo

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Came from humble beginnings doing double shifts
Got sticks, these not Doublemint
Just like the B.I.G. double disc
With different hustles, double-dip
We're trouble you don't know who you fuckin' wit'
Let off a couple
Touch a blood clip and let off a trunk and fix
I'm with that white girl
I'm in that sunken place
The Roly must be punched in the face
Get the ice tray
Some say life is like a dice game
Stakes is high
Any minute the price could change
I'm shitting hard
I need my diaper changed
The pain will just get wiped away
I had on diamond chains to light the way
I'm shining bright and turning night into day
I'm a Viking
I might bite your face
Ain't nuttin' nice, I ain't no slice of cake (no)
Fuck if you feel some type of way just type away
On cyberspace, you’re better off waiting on the sky to break

[Chorus: Knowledge the Pirate]
Listen
Food on the table, coke on the stove (yeah, whip that)
Secret society, Bohemian Grove
We took five fish and five loaves
And fed five-thousand, I guess I'm like Christ I suppose
We drove hoopties up the bumpy roads
Now we pull up in foreigns on them bumpy roads
Listen, yo
