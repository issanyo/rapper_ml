[Verse 1: RetcH]
Yo, uh, high water pressure shower hit from all angles
My shorty stepping out in nothing but some gold bangles
Waiter asked me 'bout dessert, I told him, "No thank you"
I got a plate with that pack, I'm like Criss Angel
Wake up with your bitch, drink some OJ
I'm in Dolce when I pull up where your ho stay
That's why these niggas riding dick like a dollar bus
When we was younger, man, it started out a lot of us
But life run it's courses, nigga, wins and losses
I seen cells, I seen coffins, I want Benz and Porsches
Get 5 mil today, I'm going to get the Lambo truck
Get on that stage, every time I'm bigging Yambo up, uh
Rest in peace Fredo, shoutout Chief and Tadoe, uh
Ballout, that's the homie, RIP Elato
On Blood Money, white tees where they hanging out
Ain't leave the guns at the house though, we bring 'em out
I did some shit could get me sent that I can't speak about
SLAP program, let my niggas spend a weekend out
Going to trial, that's the toughest shit I ever did
Nigga pointing from the stand right in front my kid
Same nigga that I used to call my fucking brother
Couldn't be closer if we had the same fucking mother
But life run it's courses, nigga, wins and losses
Faced the opposition often, I ain't never forfeit

[Chorus: Roc Marciano]
Uh, no surrender, no retreat
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes indeed
Can't no cheese come between us like Nino and G
Time'll tell, we gon' see what it's gon be, niggas gon' bleed
Dubs and losses, dubs and losses
Now the Lambo got 800 horses
Yeah, very clean

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Yo, with the stub, rude awakening
Stick you for your jewels, dude, we taking 'em
Can't move in the same space I'm in
Hop in the coupe, shake Jake and 'em
Check the shape I'm in
The breaks, we came for them, we had stake in them
Pistol whip the lame, push his facial in
And mix it 'caine to the ankle 'em
The wrist game had every angle lit
Bitch playing with a bangle, kid get mangled
Slid with your bitch, I finagled it
Don't get your mango split, your Kangol won't fit
And then I dip like I'm finger rolling it in
You already know what it is
Don't stick your nose in my biz, you get whipped
Now go get a switch, I'm the same, I never switched
This game, I was heaven sent
Shit was hectic, I did my James Evan stint
But kept some change ever since, uh
These ain't just records, I really check your chin
Motherfucker

[Chorus: Roc Marciano]
Uh, no surrender, no retreat
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes indeed
Can't no cheese come between us like Nino and G
Time'll tell, we gon' see what it's gon be, niggas gon' bleed
Dubs and losses, dubs and losses
Now the Lambo got 800 horses
Yeah, very clean
