Listen, get money, big dummy

Verse 1 [Sean Price]
Uno, dos, tres, quatro
Hugo Boss, the threads is macho
Small time, hundred twenty five Small time, hundred twenty five gram rapper rapper
Raw rhymer, gun in my hand fam, clap ya
Way back, when Ma$e rapped, gat and one case
Sniff that, we act laid back and gun play (P!)
A murder-matician
Magician with words, observe the diction
Play this shit on the radio
Parade this shit and then pay me dough
I'm trying to sell out
Sold out shows and sold out stores
I'm a pocket full of crack that I sold outdoors
Now a nigga thinking the bigger picture, Kodak flow
I'm Thundarr, pa, Dunbar Olegba
Ape creating the Blafrican race
This the New Yakub flow
Decease your speech, decrease the peace
Piece of shit, I'm at peace with this
Contract breached, contact two piece on street, P!

Verse 2 [Sean Price]
Uh, what it do, nigga?
Fresh Wallys on the Don, Sean is a rude nigga
Few figure the style, your style ain't new nigga
Go Jesus and a tre-deuce to shoot niggas
Kinda young when Run made It's Like That
Knife and gun fight like duke I'll be right back
Listen, came back in a half an hour
Aim gats when I clap them cowards, P
The way we responding, fire
You get fired, Avery Johnson
Trife niggas that be broker than spouse
For life, nigga, Brooklyn in the house
P, bar-for-bar the best bar-barian Sean
Arm double Leg Arm Head and the Don
Head from a broad, duke I was the head of the class
You got a lot of a kids but I'm better at math, P

Verse 3 [Roc Marciano]
Every line that I wrote's a line of coke
The .45's in the lining of my coat
I'm sick, I rhyme like the common cold
You'll find my rooms next to diamonds and gold
Fire the chrome, one eye like a cyclone
Standing on your last five toes
I done suffered all the highs and lows
My clothes never had rhinestones on 'em
The wines imported
Fuck a play fight, your paper too light
I'm out in France I might stay for two nights
Whenever I think I'm too nice
I push on ice, have a soft drink
You niggas know the forte
At night, covered in a quarter million
A sight with a thong, a long haired Brazilian
Brilliance, BM will still flip it
Endorse still smoke a lot of gills on a fish
This is bliss when I spray it on [??]
Maybe that's just the way it is
This is bliss when I spray it on [??]
Then I'm out in my '86
Marc, nigga
