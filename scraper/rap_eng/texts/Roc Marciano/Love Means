[Intro]
What's life about?
You don't go through it as a man's man
You should suck it up, take the fall
Do the time
That's made you who you are
That makes you what you are

[Chorus: Sample]
The lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep
Like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
Love leads...

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Yo, I started the Ac' when I started the rap
I started the map when I started up repeating my task
I wasn't leavin' the past so where's the future at
On the same hand that wrote his lady letters in the sand
The name's Peretta but I'm better known as Letterman
With all due respect to Kevin Madison
I'm so adamant, this veteran, produce medicine
Got juice but who doesn't, I lose nothin'
It wasn't mine, his crew's bluffing'
I'm paid due'd up, you was off base, screwed up
Dudes fronting, out of their mind and lost their tone
Fast descent, lost their heir, lost their throne
Lost their dome to the weight of the world
Now they call stack to get 'em, I'll be waiting concerned
I waited my turn, live it up and get the entrance
Stated my name with the four finger pendant
I made it, cheese gets grated, full paid it
I'm Eddie, Iron Maiden with the ready iron make shift
I lick a shot like Jamaicans and never jamming
Still raining pots and pans and I haven't landed
I'm out setting our name in stone till it's branded
Trying, I'm eyeing what it is in candid
EV, Roc

[Chorus: Sample]
The lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep
Like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
Love leads...

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Pay homage
Tank drain 88 piranhas
The promise
I need a check with 3 commas
Hit the tropics, switch the topics
The pants come with six pockets
Twist limbs out the sockets
Then hopped in the Benz and went shopping
Exotic backdrops, laughter and apricots
After squats my lady top Deborah Cox
With half a cock hit the g-spot
The queen twat was hairy like an Ewok
I still eat the box (eat it!)
My reality is different
Caribbean mistress apparently I’m gifted
Miami link and ice twisted
The mic’s within striking distance
Rappers bite for nutrition
Peep my description
My face is like an ancient Egyptian
Translate the sacred encryption
And dip with the naked vixen to feel friction
Pulp Fiction, prediction
Smooth jumper Mitch Richmond
Drug prescription, I get the symptoms
Pop in a centrum this is princedom
Benz emblems
Rip a tendon, break the timbs in, bend 'em
Defend the kingdom, sting ‘em
The pies sling ‘em
But the price is to sacrifice freedom

[Outro: Sample]
The lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep
Like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
Love leads...
