[Intro - Knowledge The Pirate]

Uh-huh
You already know... It's that pirate shit
Let's get into this
The life of a drug lord

[Verse 1 - Knowledge The Pirate]

Them niggas losing weight
My niggas be moving weight
Sit at the table get food on your plate
Before you eat, nigga just say your grace
Handcuff in [?] while we stuffing our face
Trey eight on my waste, four fifth on the hip
Extended clip, cocain benefits
Desert Eagle for my nemesis
Uh... suppliers and buyers illegal immigrants
US citizens dividing dirty benjamins
Bentley and Benz's for my gentlemen and women friends
Foreign cars, european rims
Double R sapphire gin, crème da la crème
Get down or lay down like JBM
Yeah Pirates...Let's get into this shit
This is La Cosa Nostra, black mafiosa
Shoulder strap gats and holster
All black, 2 straps stashed in the rover
La vida loca, Keyser Söze with the coca
Bet your man fold like a hand of poker
Hundred grand wrapped in rubber bands
Make the stash inside the sofa
400 grams before the night is over
Standing on MLK staring at broken dreams
Serving coke and dope to fiends like Malcolm X by any means
If neccesary send 'em to the cemetery
Send a kite out to Larry to read his name in an obituary
To my adversaries, 6 feet deep is where they're buried
Fight or flee or either plead the fifth to the jury

[Spoken by Roc Marciano]

Order in the courtroom, order in the court
Order in the coutroom damn it!... Yeah

[Verse 2 - Roc Marciano]

Crash the shores with the swords
Throwin' paws, wood floors, I have no flaws
They horde behind closed doors
Due to my vocal chords, taunt the whole orb
Avoid the morgue like the hawk
Cock the four and I'm assured, the crown has thorns
They mourne when you passed on
I yawned and moves the glass pawn
Weather the storm with persistence, the ship drifted
Plus the coat I wore was water resistant
Proud gun, a hundred round drums
Come or lose a thumb, you know the outcome
The clouds block the sun
Moonless nights amongst the mice and the termites
Knights, troglodytes
Stack the bills to Bill Cartwright height
From that height up to the satellite... twice
Yeah yeah that's right, crack the ice
My cut of cloth jacket's rare like the white rhino
Prepared an airtight recital, defend the title
Rocked the belt that made the flesh melt
Possessed by the wealth, you're lying to yourself
This is like lion vs elk, the nine is on the shelf
Dip the five inside the almond milk... tilt

[Outro - Roc & Knowledge]

Word nigga, drug lords
Marc, word up, Pirate
Ya'll niggas throw rocks and hide your fucking palms man
You already know
We social network niggas straight up
Word up, ya'll pussy shit, won't respect it
But I'mma tell you like this nigga
This shit mines man, ya'll niggas can't live man
'Bout to put a foot on ya'll niggas neck
Slide up in your shit late night, pillow in your face
Thirty eight, knock your fucking block off, straight up...
