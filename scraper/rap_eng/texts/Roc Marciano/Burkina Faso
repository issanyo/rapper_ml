[Verse 1]
Chase money, taste bubbly
Aches, I get the shakes
Takes more than cocaine to numb me
Bang ace, angel grace but I ain't grumpy
.44 Bulldog, no time to raise puppies
As a youth I was a drifter
Tan chucks, you keep the dunks - I'm not a hipster
Forever thuggin', break the oath I send a ho to get ya
Bad bitch, squeeze the colt like a boa constrictor
Might cop the Lotus but I've outgrown it
The barrel smoke, my targets is never out of focus
Me and my lady slow kiss, low in the hot tub soakin'
Michael Bolton soft word spoken
You dudes nerds, I cruise and turn, you ?
That's my word, I call my Lil Uzi Vert
Set up recruiting mercs in Newark
Taste my new work to make fiends shoes chirp like a bluebird
Lime green Diablos, Picassos, bikini models
My queen from Burkina Faso
Dreamy eye ho, body like a bottle
I was rockin' some mean Feraggamo hard-bottoms
Y'all ain't gotta pay me homage, just pay me in dollars
There really ain't nothing left to say about it
I'm outtie

[Verse 2]
Stock on the Tec fold to the left nigga
VVSs have my neck lit up
You gave your necklace up, you jetted in the Cressida
Might paint the Maybach matte black, it got eczema (ashy)
Don't get beside yourself boy I get you clipped
My little midget bitch kick you in the dick
Crocodile tears for pimps, snakeskins
Harley Davidsons, I'm on my eighth Benz
Shot where alligator swim, glass of Jameson
Sammy Davis frames
Covered every base you made a [?]
Take caution, I'm taking offerings
I had bitches hawking in Nordstroms, to long Austrians
Saw the BMs from the Auris like Michael DeLorean
Let's see who was next on the laundry list
I knew him as a scrawny kid, we was gonna be lit
Shorties I was like fourteen then
No kleenex, not out the game my nose it ain't clean yet
Might hold up the CVS to catch Xanax
Hammers up in the handrest, damn I'm fresh
My leather look like sandwich spread
My waves silky like my last name Sanchez
