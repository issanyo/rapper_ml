[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Foreign exports, dress boss, select the escort
That was just a fresh thought
Ralph Lauren tee, the Porsche Jeep come with the warranty
Performance fee worth a quarter key
Let the mink drape, drink the grapes behind the gates
The G5 skate, apply grace
Tongue kiss a fifth, I'll wrap your bitch up like a gift
This must be how it feel to reel in fish
Keith Sweat sang at the wedding
I rap with the 10 in leggings
Offend the peasants, presence
Black or Spanish be the preference, reverence
With lead you beg to get your head wrenched
I'm like Clooney, in ghetto jewelry
Hold the Uzi, the stone I threw you was a Ruby
I move smoothly
Roll a doobie in the jacuzzi, after the movie
She asked to do me, I replied absolutely
Sex noises, unfamiliar voices
We make choices, the poor witness the rich man rejoices
Tans in January, forever camera-ready
Hammers is heavy, scams are petty
Hands are sweaty, hold the wheel steady
Canary yellow scaglietti, Pendergrass Teddy
A classic medley
Champagne rolley, shows for ladies only
El Padroni, my ears ghostly
The Lex interior was Oak Tree
Liberian poulty, approach me
From young to older hoes with crows feet
Blow spliffs, flows emotionless, you're broken in six
Frozen wrists I throw a poker chip, bitch
