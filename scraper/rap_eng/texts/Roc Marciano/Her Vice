She don't wear the same thing twice
Changing clothes is her vice
Lots of money in her pocket book
And she stay wearing the natural look

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

Chanel smell, detail fingernail
Benz CL she yell, "never pay retail"
Sleeped in Cazals on the DL
Popped the E pill
Crocodile olive green Gucci belt
Steaming in the spot
Fendi head tie, I watched her exercise
After breakfast and massage
Played the high rises kinda posh fly ambiance
Body parts extreme line like Ferrari cars
Fuckin' her hard, I caught a Charlie Horse
Spokes soft, 'Lo Sport
Dripped in Armani like body wash
Red bottom bitch
Thick hippopotamus hips
Fall in the closet like a bottomless pit
Got a fit, nothing but designer shit
Inside of it to pull out
Fly like bullets in a shootout
Blue medal gal shoe sale spell
L'Oreal story to tell
Three-quarter pell

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

Prada bags, pop tags, hopping out of Jags
Bypass, brolic ass, fat bottom half
Jordache stash, fashion ave class
Drags of hash
Coffee with the splash will have your head
Mascara on the eyelash, just a tad like Stacey Dash
Head up to Macy's in a cab you flag
Marc Jacob shaded glass, Burberry plaid
Jet lag abs, It's like a model on a Guess ad
Throw back a bottle in a mess tab
Flesh you stab, I rip the dress with the leather straps
She laughed at the rap
And denim with the Apple Bottom patch
You shallow like water in a bottle cap
Borrowing hats, Louis Vuitton shower caps
Towel to match, wolves howl at
Devour the outlet rack
Take a power nap then bounce back
Jeans run her ass about a stack
How's that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Knowledge the Pirate]

What she like, huh?
Surfing, cycling, tennis, yoga
Four seasons resorts
Walking around in them biker shorts
ESPN on the screen, she watches sports
Panamera banana Porsche, peeling off
Hermes bags, Kara Ross, Chanels jewels, Christian Dior
Bottega Veneta, Nanette Lepore
A millie a poochie in and out the Gucci store
36-32-48, this bad bitch increased the murder rate
She dressed to kill in them Giuseppe heels
Shit is real, she got the skills to pay the bills
She love popping them tags
Hopping them Jags
Shopping on 5th ave
Tryna grab whatever she can have
18 karats in gold, 20 karats in ice
Yeah, she gon' live that life
