[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

I got Lamborghini dreams
Nissan nightmares
Moving white my ice cool as the night air
Two fives flare
Glare through your Cartier eyewear
And knock ya newborn out of the high chair
Devour n tear
Slice ya by the hair like pear
The prey I share fruit that I bear
I get nectarine in the Beam
I steam a whole seventeen
Brolic chain chunk cheddar cheese
Spray up chumps
TEC's jam like Heavy D
Hoes lay bread on me like deli meat (woah)
That's pimpish
Pass the Mack 10 to my apprentice
While I get a pen and pad to print this
Then slide nine inches in your Empress with the quickness
You get ran through swifter than Wind Sprints
You a byproduct
Of guys that grind and buy product
Black cards lie inside Prada wallets
Black cars glide like flying carpets
The 40 lay you out like a starfish
I'm doing God's work in the booth
This was Allah's wish
I put a skirt on the Coupe
Squirt 32s that'll burn in your soup
Muthafucka

(Yeh baby)

[Bridge]

Light one up
Feds might run up
They might want us
Henny on ice with my styrofoam cup
Dimes get fucked
Lynx with the nine get stuck
Rip cake and glide in the truck
These are emeralds
Only generals resemble
We throwing up signs and symbols
We throwing up sings and symbols

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

You just a pawn on the chessboard
I move pieces
On squares like Louis sneakers
Polices gonna burn 'em off like leeches
For beneath us people need to see the uniqueness
Speak your mind like telekinesis
Steam reefers
Watching pelicans on beaches
Slide long meat deep in Georgia peaches
Them whores be the source of your weakness
I take broads do what I see fit
Break laws money grip thick like Queen pin
Rolex they gleam where my sleeve end
My enemy knee bend, my team win
You bleeding
Feel the Reaper creeping
A brief wind the grim bring a freeze to your skin
Squeeze three at your BM
Till your meat spin
You hanging on by a thin tree limb
Cock weapons and pop the specimen
With elegance, metal wrench to wear, glass settle in
Your head been turned into gelatine
I ride with gentlemen
Hollow tops fly through your melanin
Cocksucker..
Word up....
