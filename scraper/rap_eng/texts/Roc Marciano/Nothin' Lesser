[Scratches]
Like we filin' in the U.N
That's because my word is bond

[Dino Brave]
Two for timin', shout out, this one's for money rhymes
Take to 'em hard boiled, charbroil a fraud
Holy ghost Peter Plymouth Rock landed on us
Isle native Kareem sky hook 'em, Dano raps book 'em
Hawaii five tries to come a lie jive
Euro express be offin' of your head to the rest
Box slap your teeth gold raps with a foot in a sewer cap
Sucka dance em, and hit 'em off like Noah
To a eyy thing, yo that'll show and prove in my cash flow
Rippin' out long dough featurin' prophecy
Represent how I stay so, gimme my freedom
Yeah, you wanna join the UN you can't beat 'em
You and Dino Brave haas, at all cost b'gosh
Punk feel when I blast one, dare to everyone
Be quick to shoot at the mouth some
Sparks a starter pistol, son get issues that supercedes my unborn (?)

[Hook: Roc Marciano]
It's like no matter the weather, gettin' money, whatever
Never say never, niggas we got to get this cheddar
The crew is fresher, it's the UN and nothin' lesser
Who wan test us? Yo, no one can do it better

[Laku]
Feeling it, verbally killing it, UN affiliate
Crowd controllin' it, forever standin' my grounds I'm holding it
Kick for the hood, kick it for those in the strong
Kick it for my niggas still here and arrestin' the god(?)
Kickin' it while I dwell in the street, or while I be stressed
While I be gettin' dressed and just black in the middle of sex
While I be hittin' shorty off in the back, I just be usin'
The sound of the claps for one of my thunderous tracks
Rappers be buggin' thinkin' they hot, until I showed 'em
They nothin' but duns, you was never blowin' the spot, I don't
Catch cold, the only thing I'm catchin' is wreck
And catchin' your girl at the bank while she cashin' a check (what)
Finessin' a track, and Pete Rock blessin' it black
The number one brother of soul it don't get better than that

[Hook]

[Mic Raw]
Very instrumental (uhh)
Not coincidental (uhh)
Blast through your speaker like a missle live official
Major league rhyme sayer blast through your curve of acres
Operator lay ya down blaze the sound fader
Cross paths calculated mad splash when they feel the wrath
Hundred yard dash John Carlos fast
Theoretically, livin' out a legacy
Chemistry form the UN, the bond is symphony
Five lights through a prism, shine light and spread wisdom
Dice games they rig 'em still tamperin' the system
Last I be the first, we inherit the earth
Four corners of the cypher now who bringin' the dirt

[Hook]

[Roc Marciano]
Yeah, ya, yo, I'm out there
Slingin' my rap kiddo, soon to get a black Benzo
With the intent to bliddo, you know my MO
With no ques-t-on, I demo, write a memo
Yo, let's be on, SP ya'll, espionage
Three is odd, European cars
In the dead sea with a large burn fuckin' with ours
What you receive is a foul verse that flood your heart
Marc, I eight and oh, when they enroll, flavor eight
Ways finagle a ho, Cake baker and blow away somethin'
Melodramatic, niggarole gigolo jingle bell
Ringer around your atoms, the rap mandingo
Yoke a mic up, slam it, vocalize two hundred coats
Frozen ice move like magic aerodynamic
Tool of the masses, manufacture some rap shit
Crack a barrel of half, put ten in this mac shit

[Hook]
