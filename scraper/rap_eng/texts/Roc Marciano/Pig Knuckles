R-r-r-r-really though
Really though

Uh

[Verse 1]

Pull the drops out in the summer
I played Prince
While I waited on my bitch
When you rich you fly your jewelers in from Zurich
Vintage Woolwich
I'm nothin' to be fooled wit'
I light a spliff in the memory of Ruck
We made legendary shit
I'm a history buff (Rest in peace, my man)
Treat the coke like grapes how we be stepping on it
The Feds was on us
They thought that we was teleportin'
Park the Vette up at the heliport we teleport
I weather the storm
I pray my umbrella's strong (I pray)

Pump the shotty like a black top (black job)
*Until we hit a cop I ain't satisfied (uh)*
Gladys Knight blaring in the Vantage
My shorty copped pink rings like Cam'ron
Nigga I'm hands on
I do my dirt but all my cars get hand washed
Yacht parties on the Mediterranean
Melanated - my complexion is radiant
Steerin' the Rolls let off pheromones
There's nothing to fear but fear alone
I could move to any hood and feel at home

Really though
Really though
Really though

[Verse 2]

The white Evoque is like coke
Silencers on the Colt come from Idaho
The DB9 ??
I could stoop to your level or take the higher road

I inspired your flow
Give a black man back his Science and Gold
We let the devil inside our homes
Designing clothes but he lied and stole
Clone rhymes, took wine and clothes
The whole time slept with one eye closed
You're not a boss ??
Bitches get real friendly when you wear Fendi
Sittin' in the XJ like Gorgeous Dre
Overcoat - three quarters suede
We never slum where the corner's played
I just gotta call a spade a spade

Mmm
Uh

[Outro]
Life ain't pinochle
Don't get caught in the shuffle
My fingers quintuple
My trigger fingers
Smoke a nigga like pig knuckles

Life ain't pinochle
Don't get caught in the shuffle

Rosebud

Really though
