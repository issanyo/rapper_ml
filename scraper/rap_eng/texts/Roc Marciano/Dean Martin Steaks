[Verse: Roc Marciano]
Dope gang, gold chain
Camouflage suits
Black Range, Jag pink
Carolina blue
Masked up, flash bucks
Marijuana coof
Play the booth
Display a Dr. Malachi book
The pie cook, your eyes get the wide look
Provide kush
Galvanize troops, advertise crooks
The beef got tied up by the hoof
Swing on a hook
Youâ€™re horsing on a hook, you're being cooked
Proceed and push
Off in that plush European truck
I'm peeing in your cup
My G is seasoned in the dub
I popped up, your feathers got plucked
Your peacock jumped
And give the cheap diamond G-shock up
Then marvel at what's under the Starter cap, part of rap
Bitch stay in pocket like a quarterback
Thoughts of a stack before the snap
I got the bomb like I caught the pass
And I enjoy a hot oil bath
