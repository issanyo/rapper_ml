Verse 1: Cormega

I'm driven by, will to succeed
And ill Vs i sit inside
MC's are terrified
Lyrically I'm mesmerized
However I still grieve
Friends who die yearly, tears flowin'
Like the waters in the Nile
The bars are hard
Like Charles Oakley with a foul
Which means come in my lane
Imma send you out
Keepin' it real is rare
But I can show you how
It comes naturally as
Venom in a cobra mouth
Never the snake the type
I'm hear to embrace life
And grace mics like six rings for
Playing the game right
Fly on the regular
Not just when I take flight
High off life
You get high to escape life
Shank death? worth ain't livin'
Pay attention
It don't cost you nothing
Wisdom gains interest
So stack it in abundance
When you have if you can touch it
Can be salvation
To the savages among you

Verse 2: Roc Marciano

Yo
Steel and stone
Blood and bone
Shalom
Preferred to sleep alone
My secrets are my own
The streets are cold
Sneakers are old
Sleeperhold
The reefers rolled
Pigs street patrol
Speeding calls? around the ladies
My dresscode is expired by the 80's
My fleshtone is flyer than a babys
Swiss accounts
Switch routes
Sniff an ounce
Niggas vouch, still my gun was out
Dream in color, a swedish lover
My penis is covered in rubber
Your whole demeanor
Is out the cookie cutter
The memoirs
These are pimp laws
Sinners interest soar
I rock the same Valore
That Prince wore
A mentor convinced a french whore
A pinch more
Im pissed poor
Steal you get washed and rinsed off
Basically im like gracie in the ACG
I waited patiently as A.C. Green
Looked at me for like eighteen keys
Before the jigs put out the APB
I was laid up in the suite
Shit is sweet

Verse 3: AG Da Coroner

Crack the Henny bottle
Full throttle
Oldsmobile the color of avacado
Hit Chicago wit a Bajan model
Designer jeans
Kurt Randis goggles
A hard left in the Murci√©lago
Pimp hand strong
Straight flush on the table
Abel killed Cain
Cause Cain wasn't Able
We live facts not fables
Pump some life into your wife
With the jumper cables
All my life
I've been a misunderstood soul
Quiet as kept
The kid lived pretty good tho
Welcome to the hood show
This is good blow
Best drug you ever did
Nigga i would know
Lift ya glass up
The street pastor
Toasts after
The machete have ya throat leaking ketchup
Caught up in the rapture
A needle blastin through the speakers
Serious shit hold the laughter
I have the porkchops call for backup
Riot in order, hair trigger my niggas act up
Roll the dice with my life
Hit the cee-lo everytime
Sip the nectar
The juice is very fine
Some of these niggas are on the decline
Trying to move with times
Keep hittin rewind
These the glory days
For me and mine
Chinese spare ribs
And a shot of that Korean wine
