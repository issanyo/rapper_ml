[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

I'm like Tony in the silver Carrera, they don't build 'em no better
Bitch I'm back, and I'm filthy as ever, hot stepper
Red pepper steak dinner, weight spinner, lady killers, chains glimmer
Lames feel us like painkillers, nigga we Range whippers
Rain dripping on my suede British, stay driven like made niggas
Gems shimmer like stage glitter, base slingers slice cake pieces
Bang pieces, left face creases, break speakers, snake sneakers
Got keys like gatekeepers, pitbulls on short leashes
Portuguese divas feed us, my Adidas, don't put your big stank feet in
Peep game like mind readers, in my wife beater, fire heaters
Ride the beat like zebra, me and this games' like Ike & Tina
I'm a dreamer, 745 Beamer, Aquafina, blood spill by the liter
Plus deliver like cheese pizza, I'm my brother's keeper
Send 'em to the grim reaper, don shit

[Hook: Roc Marciano]

Gats in the guitar case, Scarface
This be that don shit, ex con shit
Gats under the armpit, cigars lit
Mob flicks and hardships
Nigga this be that don shit

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

Palm trees and exotic v's, overseas
Somewhere in Belize blowing sour deez
Stay dipped like sour cream
Keep chips, get the powder cheap
Squeeze clips at you coward feet
We the shit, peep how it stink
In my palace on the balcony
Turn spit to a house and Jeep
Now see, that's alchemy
You out your league, ?
Three bricks on the couch, see
At the crib out in south beach
Kingpin style beats, green Benz 'bout east
Brown fleece, Richard Roundtree steez
The big cheese, bitch please
Take six while I shift speeds
K spit, never K-Swiss, gangsta clique
Nickel-plated on the waist sit
Plus the grey ? stay way thick
Like a shackles on a slave's wrists
Gator kicks, keep the eighth of sniff like face did
Rich base heads pay less, break the desk
Out in Great Neck, trained pets
Bitches that play the clarinet rep
While we crept in the NSX red, don shit
