Set up shop, shop
Clear off the block, block
If they ain't with us
They're getting shot, shot
That's how we rock, rock
Like it or not, not
We run the spot, spot
Let's make it pop
Let's make it pop, pop, pop, pop, nigga, pop, pop

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Sipping Andr√©, watching Scarface
With my bitch in Carl's place
Regina called, I waited all day
Feet up, she wonder how Cristal taste
I flick my ashes in a small vase
The phone rang, I took in the hallway
"Yo, what's the word on that bird, ya heard
Swerve through and tell me what occurred over herb"
We spoke loose and no one overheard
"Wally shot Boo in the neck
They caught him hopping out the vet
In front his momma house with skinny Collette
Left him from the nine milly wet, really upset"
My whole set's Naughty By Nature like Vinny and Treach
We're trying to make a penny stretch
But back to what happened about the clapping
Is he dead? (Yeah)
Now all we gotta do is keep the shifts rotating
And pray Allah, strays don't hit kids roller skating
The stones get to breaking
Now look at all this dough we making
Niggas is hating like they worship Satan (damn!)
Because I'm bringing home the turkey bacon (yeah!)

Six months blew past fast
We're getting cash
Got about a mill in the stash
Money in bags
Eighty thousand dollar Jags and crabs
Flabby abs, eating
Wasn't nobody mad
Except for who we moved out
Rival crews but survival rules
So dudes wanna be cool now
I move around
With the two pound in my goose down
"It's a new Sheriff in town" like Nino Brown
Low profile and lock shit down like we know how
I'm trying to make my people proud
But what's up with this yelling about us selling
Ain't that foul? (uh huh) (yeah!)
Snitches are snitching
I play the kitchen, my work is pitching
Cutting crack up on dirty dishes
Burgundy sixes
D's kicked my shit up off the hinges
My run ended, my funds wasn't apprehended
I beat the case, now we're back in business
Fearless
