Rosebud

Yeah
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
The first chain I ever owned
I stole a Herringbone (Herringbone)
The end result: I boned a yellow bone
Back when I was peddling blow in the red zone
I can see me in Venezuela in dress clothes
Pressing hoes for dough, my words echo
Pearls on my girl neckbone
Songs in falsetto
Architecture Art Deco (oh)
My shit fuego
We on the same level?
That's far fetched bro
Yayo connect from Mexico, we ghetto
Shoulda knew from the getgo
I'd blow to be Gordon Gekko
Don't poke the hornet's nest that's deaths threshold (who that?)
You never know; I might be cold, wrong, regretful (fuck you up)
Stretch the coke below the old retros
Blow your head off with the pump
Your shit'll roll from the stand in Modesto (whoo')
Back with a vengeance
The bak' ain't adequate
We gon' have to add interests (tax 'em)
Pimp shit, medium polo packed; a slim fit
We in this shit
My thick bitch came as a fringe benefit (yes)
Money, furs 'n ice
These is birthrights
Mas'[on] Verger-type, the merchandise is persian white
Cursing like you got a personal gripe
Get you murdered for sum'in 'night - on-site - aight?
Blood on my Nikes
The white on whites
My ice is looking like Sprite
We don't look a like
You look like a butch dyke
I'm the type to cop the F-Type (mm..)
I'm a stylist, I'll give you a columbian necktie (nice)
X'd your name out
Heads popped w' one headshot - blreah!
Left a big red spot (dead)
Order some eggs, left the restaurant prompt
I might, knock down your moms
She look like Gloria Estefan (she look good)
The product all stepped on
My lexicon is like an ex-con's
All my shirts 's ?made of? chiffon
I'm not some nigga you can shit on

[Verse 2]
Lights - you know how the game go
Burberry raincoat
My stable of hoes, it came wit' a stagecoach (uh)
You sho' lame, you need a stage coach
Iâ€™ll show you how to rock
Just play it low and just take notes
I show you the ropes
Life's like a tightrope
Icin' my foe like pimpin' white folk
Might cop the white gold
You not even likable
?My niggas body shit looking like a bull?
? ? ? ?
Dance in the night with wolves
Tanzanites made my hands look nice
Slice the grams of Vanna White like samurais
I handle mine - you push up dandelions
Let the handle of the nine crack your hairline

Motherfucker I'm the real one
I'm the real one
Motherfucker I'm the real one
?? shit, Don Juan
I'm the real one
