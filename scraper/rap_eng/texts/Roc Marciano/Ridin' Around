[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

This ghetto crew we roll around in a hoop
Hustle for loot, hundred dollar sneakers and boots
Hit the streets with my crew, and shootin' heat off the roof
It was just me and a few, don't let that reefer canoe
Bon Appetit, let's eat, read it and weep
Too many indians wanna be the chief
Tuck the semi, kiss my mom on the cheek
Don't be out showin' your teeth
Niggas'll think shit is sweet
So keep it low and discreet
Especially if you holdin' dough niggas'll open your meat
It's deep, I learned this shit from an OG on the street
Don't be a fool when you speak, you either wolf or you sheep
I just spit truth on a beat, and keep a scoop on a freak
Absolute fire you deal wit', set fire to the entire building
Inspire children, rob sapphire and chill when
But till then just admire the realness

[Hook]

All these guns
Take em uptown, ridin' around (8x)

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

Check it
You know the drill, money over bitches still
Load the steel and go in for the kill
All the way from Sugar Hill to Brazil
Back to the 'ville, stack bills, smack niggas all in they grill
But chill, we on the strip, new whip (new whip!)
Seen us cruisin' up one two fifth, (two fifth!)
Who could resist the wrist isn't it brisk?
G slippery like fish, in my FILA kicks
And to me you like Leon Spinks
Nigga we shine like neon, bitch
Peons get peed on quick
Like a street harlet at the bar gettin' me all stiff
We could call shot, free off this
No key just squeeze off fifths
Strike a cord like a guitar lick
Sit and relax to this beat for a sec
Then I'm out like a green Corvette

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]

If we can't make dough we take dough (baby it's mossberg)
And ain't a damn thing change ho
I stay on the down low
Niggas be frontin' like they rugged but they throwin' in the towel though
Niggas I shot some, I always kept a shotgun
In the trunk of the Datsun, you don't want your top spun
I get busy, with the semi just gimme
When the cops come, shimmy up the block for Phillies
We got the city on lock really, I'm hot as a pot of chili
Papa Willy, Mom feel me
The Mac milly rock his ass silly
Get back to me, cash money keep a bag plenty
Absolute fire you deal wit', set fire to the entire building
Inspire children, drop a sapphire and chill when
But until then just admire the realness

[Outro]
We gonna take 'em uptown
Ridin' around
????
Got some bitches in the backseat wit' pipes in their mouth
Trunk full of hashish we supplyin' the town
We gonna take 'em uptown
And dump 'em in the Hudson River
What, what we dump 'em in the Hudson River
Nigga, yeah
We dump 'em in the Hudson River
Right after I plug a nigga
