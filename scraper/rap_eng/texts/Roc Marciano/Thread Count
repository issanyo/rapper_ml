[Verse 1]
In seclusion I pin up piff
In the Land Cruiser
Tan like I been to Cuba
Keys is white like sand in Aruba
Exude confidence from my view of the metropolis
I fed flakes to my tropical fish
Pulled the top off the six like Badu wig
I'm no pushover, I push a Rover
You push a Puma like a foot soldier
I put dough up like I push Cola
And cock the pistola, hands inside of Isotoners
Spend a night with a dice roller
You pray your ice gets returned to its rightful owner
The rifle's in the trunk of the Caddy
We'll dump you in the swamp somewhere down in Miami
My brush stroke the canvas
You're caught in the gambit
And pimp slapped open handed
I demanded for the operation to be expanded
Be a standard, the G I ran was enchanted
Tool belt wearing, I'm a mechanic
Bad bitch swinging in the hammock
I took a dip in the Atlantic
And bit the salmon
It's slamming

[Verse 2]
Kamaal hit me
I sit up in the 450
Shifty, this is raw nigga, history
A slick pimp might resort to trickery
Bitches dig me
The money fall short like a pygmy
Waves flow like the Mississippi
Guns longer than the wig on a hippie
On the hip keep the blicky
Petite wis, opposite of Missy
Depict me as super witty
My shank might remove a titty
I jumped off the heel of my Achilles
This is light work to me
To turn a knife in your kidney
I pray Allah might forgive me
Now who could see me
Musically awake the Kundalini
And easily scoop your Nefertiti
And bump the CD in the green Lamborghini
Demonstrator in linen and gator
Slick tongue like a litigator
Facilitator, decision maker
My inner layers is the Himalayas
Frigid as a brisk winter day is

[Verse 3]
Yellow gold and terrycloth robes
The wardrobe that made hoes come in droves
With less clothes and the flesh exposed
In the Lexus we drove through infested roads
Pellets are thrown into flesh and bone
Your name get carved in the headstone, slow
Gangster cadence, my space is shaded
The heats nickel plated, assets liquidated
What I'm conveying isn't easily articulated
Roll solo like the Marcberg photo
Herb from Acapulco, we lit that
Flat screens, Cinemax promo
Benz logo, black RLX Polo
Your tongue's knotted up like show dough
But on the low though
