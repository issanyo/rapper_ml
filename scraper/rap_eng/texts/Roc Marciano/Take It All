[Verse 1: Fatima]
You can say what you want 'bout me
But I won't compromise my vision for anything
You best know one thing's for sure
The day I get my chance I'll take it all
Take it all

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Ain't shit left my niggas pillage blocks
Paint the Benz red and get the ceiling chopped
I'm a mack, fuck drug dealing that's still a job (Fuck all that)
I still keep a small Deringer in the gym sock (Wow)
Sock it to 'em Roc
Nigaas music Basura (Trash)
My shooters hit the bullseye
All I could think was get that moolah
The yayo Like like Soleil Moon Frye
Ooh ma I ain't the suit and tie type guy (Naw)
My rhymes gotta fly them in from Milan
Huh
Peep game gotta read it between the lines
Like Michael (?) raw
I got sauce
The Porsche come with dual exhaust (It do)
All you do is talk, you lost, it's food for thought
I record songs in the food court
My thoughts is jewelry store
I'm looking like a young Kool G with my Coogi on
Cool me off
Don't blew me off these shoes Dior
Salute me dog (Salute me dog)
Cooked up the raw to make Pookie rise from the fog
Stay way when there's trouble I'm on your air bubbles
Spray the tech nine with holes let air in the muzzle
Pop it down square in the Montcler tear muscle
I know you hear it bum niggas love to head hustle
I know you hear it bum niggas love to head hustle

[Verse 2: Fatima]
My eyes red and I'm seeing things
The visions of a golden portal
With angel wings
We'll make room for one and all
The love within our minds will conquer all
You've got to let it go
Let it go
