[Verse 1]
I'm like Jimmy Fly, exemplify
We don't wear Denim & Supply
South for the winter, keep the benz to drive
The spots solidified
There's no lid on the ride
I rhyme and pimp on the side
Steak with the shrimp on the side
You can't just play the fence, pick a side
I came through with a stake, this ain't for shiskabobs
Get shot and left somewhere in Wichita
Sly helped me to get inside the rib without having to try, I picked the lock
I plant your murder
My hands on the burner
Sprayed your top earners your sternum is lookin' like hamburlgar, further
Knocked off your workers, bullet holes in your furniture
My bitch body got Ferrari curvature
Hoppin out of Germans David Yurman furs
We skin these motherfuckers, what they be yearning for
Drum on the Tommy Gun is circular
I'm speakin in codes
You need interpreters to have work with us
You see what I'm working with
I'm like Frank Ward
Ya'll pay for whores
I cop Roly's and turtlenecks
Fled to the West, we had turbulence on the jet
We could never be neck in neck
My neck look like Quebec
Put some pep in your step
A Corvette is just a Chevrolet
No disrespect, we just a different mesh
My bitch get fresh in fishnets to get the checks
I'm just here for the chips, forget the rest
I grind so hard for the M's I forget to rest
My breath is winterfresh
I put your bitches under pimp arrest
I put your bitches under pimp arrest
Motherfuckers
Bum ass niggas
I put pimp cases on all you motherfuckers
Straight up
Pay your tithes, nigga

[Verse 2]
Diamond studded Tom Fords, Bottles of [?]
Olive oil colored horses is spoils of wars
Ten bricks of raw under the floorboard
My nigga check the scoreboard
I'm official across the board
We headin toward the morgue
I fled to Ecuador
?Whore I might have you beck and call?
My nigga life's like a deck of cards
I dress the way I like my cheddar; sharp
Used to rob niggas for leathers
With the homies up in his mama's Skylark
You find your body parts in New Hyde Park
I'm grown, you an old fart
You not cut from my cloth
This is culture shock
Cut the Lambo, Testarosta top
Yeah, pie, stove top
?Own stocks in baking soda?, stop   (stop it)
Take over blocks rapper hold my cock
-ing new Glocks on the road/low for cops
No road blocks
Ride out til the motor stop  (ping)
Ain't no love and hip hop
Ain't no jolly moments
?	?	?
No broke hoes allowed in my domicile
You know my style
No way no how
Ainâ€™t no way around
The fact your lady got the yayo mouth, lock-jawed out, Salvatores in the courthouse
Spider crawled up the waterspout, I'm out
