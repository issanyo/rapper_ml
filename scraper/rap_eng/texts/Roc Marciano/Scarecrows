(It's real shit, nigga
Chemo baby, what's good?
Moss
Got it
Military mind, nigga)

[Verse 1]

One in the chamber
Fifteen up in the handle
I'm up in this [? 0:47]
I'm the lambo
Show 'em how the plan go
Take a couple of a hand notes
You just stand there and pose like a scarecrow
In '96 I had the TEC with the airholes
Fiends jumping out the manholes
Grand roles
Here's a sample
We trample
Gamble
Making samples, be careful
Beware fool
We werewolves
Yeah, true
Tear through flesh
Scared niggas vamoose
Or get ran through
We pull up in that [? 1:14]
Cannons [?]
Timberland [?]
Hammers to shoot
Then ran to Cancún
Now let that soak in your do like shampoo
You can't spook me with hand moves
Boo, I'm an animal
Collect [? 1:23]
Lex Coupé [?]
Without a roof
Motherfuckers is washed up like Baton Rouge
I'm blasting a tune, clap for the loot
Plus how I rap to the tune
That's satin-smooth
Platinum jewels, natural goon
Passing the [?]
In the big Benz, black and maroon
I'm laughing at you acting a fool
But back to the [?]
[?] always keep the gat in the suit

[Chorus]

Nigga, get mines
Whether it's crack of spitting rhymes

Snatch shines off niggas arms
Then we move onto bigger jobs

Get mines
Where it's crack of spitting rhymes
Snatch shines off niggas arms
Then we move onto bigger jobs

[Verse 2]

Spark the herb
You heard nigga, Mossberg
Make the big car swerve
That's a sharp turn
Your hearse looking like starburst
Cars disperse
Plus keep the squeezer in my broad's purse
Church, tabernacle nigga, some say
Watch for the [?] cruising down the one way
Travel in peace
Oops, I meant travel with the piece
Or get clapped up in your black [? 2:33]
They rap mundane
Some running untamed
But whether sun or rain
We hustle for chump change
Dump the gauge
We jump up in that plum Range
Ain't no fun and games
My Uzi a ton it weighs
20s of haze
Blaze in my stunna shades
Cut that butter and roll like tumble weed
[? 2:50]
Blood in the streets
Gun in my reach
Up under the seat
Here's something to see

Who want it with me?
Dump in his meat
Slump in your [? 2:59]
Trying to run with a key
Plug your physique
Make love to the beat
Up on a beach
Run up in it deep
Fuck it and skeet
Nut on your sheets
[? 3:07]
Dumb on the freaks
Some on a leash
That's how some of us eat
The Summers is heat
Smuggling E
Your running your [?]
Bubbling green
That's because the struggle is deep
Nothing is free

[Chorus]

Get mines
Whether it's crack of spitting rhymes
Snatch shines off niggas arms
Then we move onto bigger jobs

Get mines
Where it's crack of spitting rhymes

Snatch shines off niggas arms
Then we move onto bigger jobs
