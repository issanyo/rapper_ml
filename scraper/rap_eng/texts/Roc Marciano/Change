(Intro)
Marci Motherfucker

(verse 1)
It turn beige in the microwave
Fuck what the bible says , I hustle to my final days
My fade cycle like a tidal wave ,Vinyl is played
Pineapple haze accolades
I pull the AC up out the Bat-cave , Jackets is suede
Tough leather like the back of a slave
Black from a lack of shade, straight hit the passenger in the range
While I was at the cabin bagging caine
Lavender rain falls on the shoulders of the ordained
The more payed, all forte ,Twenty four K gourmet
Fuck the horseplay, I jump out of the Porsche and spray
Till your complexion pale four shades
The lord made you soft as clay, But as a boss would know
Office space , pillars hold up the portico
Whores form Portugal , words from the oracle
Before the pigs raid , call the audible

(Chorus)
Change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (we blitz them)
I never change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (mother fucker)

(Verse 2)
Check it
The blood oath is taken , money falls out the but-holes of gangsters
Hang the oil paintings over fireplaces
Beige Guccis with the red and green laces
Strive for greatness , my mind shine like a diamond bracelet
You mistake wine for blood on my apron
Throw a shot back like Slick Rick with the eyepatch
Then slide the gat inside your pie-hatch
I should get a high five for that
Gospel rap n, drop a wad of dollars in the mac hat
Mashing the black , half a stack , push the seats back
Used to pump g-packs , now I punch the ATM keypad
Eating crab , and keep cash , tread the beaten path
Speak with pizzaz
Chick treat the meat like brass
Blow a note out the urethra , like Aretha
And send you soul into the ether

(Chorus)
Change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (we blitz them)
I never change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (mother fucker)

(outro)

Yeah nigga
Just motivational speaking baby thats all
Nah mean
This for all my gangster niggas straight up man
Funny style niggas you don't know nothing about this one
Word up
Eat a dick up till you hiccup baby
Pick your bitch up in the pick-up
