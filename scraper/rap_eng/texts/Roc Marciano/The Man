[Intro: Whoo!
"Shit loud nigga, not the music nigga the weed
But anyway, know what I'm saying
I could recall the last time I uhh... You know I uh
Knocked a nigga for his hoe man, you know
So I go get a nigga a bag of Nachos, He's like "what's the nachos for?" Nigga, cus it's not yo' hoe no moe'"]

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
I turn my pain into power
Back in the days put the flame to the powder
My lady waited on the counter with a towel
While I sang a Rick James banger in the shower
My folks is dependent on me
I wish you could see my vision through them tinted Cartiers
Women and liquor for the army
As for the car, bitch, this is a Ferrari
The best persevere
I start my verse when the check clear
I spark purp, silk shirt
Half open with the chest hair
Mind blowin' sex with the cognac breath
Five star spread from the chef
Never been a hater, I don't give a fuck enough
Besides that, here shits on the up and up
I got wind of betrayal
I grab a big piece of shrimp by the tail
Switch the cell, bitches on a nigga trail
I won't nail nothing less than a bombshell
Respect is the corner stone, bum niggas can't afford those clothes
The four-four is chrome with the long nose
Call it Ginobili, your real nigga show me
I'm from a better cut of cashmere
A plethra, the vest shed cat hair
Jaguar jacket, scratch the catnip
Black pimp, you bypass fat lip
Deep rooted, the piece shooted
The fact that I'm G can't be disputed
Speak foolish, you can leak fluid
Bust his chest wide open, you can see through it

[Hook]
Always a had a pack for a way to get a stack
Hustlin' this young niggas livin' in the shack
Runnin' with the pack pull level off your back
Crisp new era with the timbs all black
Hangin' in the lobby with the clique with some knuckleheads
Puffin' L's big gun by the underwear
Just in case you was unaware
I'm still a motherfucking man

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
A new chapter
A new Aston, the ghost, call it Casper
The chain is Alaska
The fact that my kicks is suede became a factor
I'm rollin' hash with my current hoes
Sniff the Chris Mullin off the envelope
Smooth game, shaved butter soap
200k straight butter loaf
Three hoes tryna rape a nigga
I'm fixated on a greater figure (money)
I scooped the bitch with the greater figure (body)
Cause I'm a grade A nigga
Paint the picture with a steady hand
Same way I hold the 40, blow 20 grand
Half naked woman tastefully, a belly dance
I bet that pussy taste like a cherry champ

[Hook]
Always a had a pack for a way to get a stack
Hustlin' this young niggas livin' in the shack
Runnin' with the pack pull level off your back
Crisp new era with the timbs all black
Hangin' in the lobby with the clique with some knuckleheads
Puffin' L's big gun by the underwear
Just in case you was unaware
I'm still a motherfucking man
