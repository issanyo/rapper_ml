[Verse 1]
I’m back with the flow you been missing
Oh you should listen to the special edition
I’m on my Long Island shit, I got my fishermen tippin’
Cruising in the Expedition, me and Dro and some bitches
We smoke the fat L
A tall Heineken was cold hoes bicker
Shut up bitch, do what you’re told
I’m not a role model but I rap from the soul
Plus the mack that I hold, shit be dipped in all gold
I’m [?] boy, I could front but I’m not
So don’t get too close because you might get shot
I challenge any rapper to a duel
Put on the beat and watch me take ‘em to school
Never been a fool, lyrically I'm placed on a pedestal
Hey son you better move or run your jewels
I came here to rock, me and my DJ on the 1s and 2s
My crew ain’t got nothing to lose
So come here girl, and don’t fuss or act boujie
I’m real choosy who I let come do me
I take a Lex to the movies with a real JET Beauty
Don’t wanna chicken-head smoking a 50 cent loosey
I got class so go take a bath
As for your math don’t make me laugh
With no ass talking all that jazz
Just shut your motherfucking mouth and walk past

[Hook]
I lay it down

[Verse 2]
Niggas like you don’t get no respect
You said I’m not the best, you wanna make a bet
I write a rhyme so fresh like organic fruit
And bounce in the orange juice coupe—here’s the scoop
I’m not asking, me I’m taxin’
Shines like neon, but we are action
Dude you a peon, I pee on fashion
Bitches come break me off for faction
You got a problem with it them come get it
We better than you, be a man and admit it
It’s either one of the two, you’re a fan or a critic
But most motherfuckers just scam this business
I just handle my business with the mack like a boss
I don’t frolic, I put the gas to your thoughts
Walk fast, we don’t have no remorse
I just kill your ass and flash in the Porsche
And it’s a fact, Jack, no man could stop me
And walk a mile in my beef and broccolis
The 90 G Maserati look like Hi-C
Polo on the beat, I’m on the M-I-C
I see, motherfuckers!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
This is just one thing I do for the dough
I like to move with a ho, duke I be on the low
We can go toe-to-toe but you know the M.O
I’m all heart, you don’t want me to let the dogs bark
I knock your corny-ass shit out the ballpark
Without saying, listen B I’m not playin’
You be dead layin’ and I be upstream
With the tight swing and a careless manner
What up the party then put up the hammer
I rep my click like a Blood with a red bandanna
From the Stat to Atlanta, bust your head like scanners
I just rip, ask around I’m the shit
I come in quick with the fifth on the hip
Rubber grip so the joint don’t slip
I stay dipped and keep a hooker on the strip
Criminal thoughts, they infect my brain
It’s insane, entertain, Rakim’s the name
It ain’t a game, you ain’t gang beater said I claim
Bang bang, just let me do my fucking thang

[Hook]
