[Verse 1]

Rock the rope, no joke
Bang you with the sock and soap
I’m locked in the flow
How could it be not so?
But why gloat?
Keep rocks to tote, behind the console
Y’all weak, let the Don flow
Like Don down the god throat
Cigar smoke at park slope
Car float like a wood log boat
Cook more coke, rock that couture coat
I meant well, pray the good lord know
Only did work to get more dough
Slang work, let them pitbulls roam
Through the home, cocaine slang through the nose
Music really orgasmic
The glass stick might crack a bit
Slave owner, make 'em crack the whip on they back and shit
I’m beating 'em hard, defeating the odds
Getting my feet massaged at the lodge, free of charge
While the meat get slabbed
I feel the need to discharge (uhh)
Spit these bars for grip, but this get rich scheme of ours
Ride around in the meanest cars, I seen it in the genie’s ball
Signs of the times is written like graffiti on the wall
For me to y’all, read the bars from a pimp daily
Sincerely, yours
Marc

[Hook]

The man, the mac
Keep my hand on the mac like Mad Max
From that I got a bad back
Gat at least a half of shack off the gun rack
Just keep where I’m at under the raps
That’s the catch ol' chap
Don’t make me go inside the backpack
Then you can hold that, lick the Bozak

[Verse 2]

G’s on the table, green sable
Squeeze, hey, you'll catch 3 in the navel
Bleed till you start seeing angels
Scene is tranquil, learn to seem not to be ungrateful
The sheet drape you all you seen was his feet and ankles
Free the dangle like a Run DMC cable
Being strangled in the fiend angle
Clean angle riding beast stable
Let the piece fade you, rest in peace may you
When I come to repay you
Revenge is sweet like tree maple
You unloyal nigga be faithful
It will be faithful when your meets cradle
Leak tomato on the street lay you
Not be anal but you weak fables ain’t deep
Slay you and let the .38 long steam Bathe you
You lame you, peep how I came through
Show that ass a thing or two
It ain’t get your crew, and then the thang-thang blew

[Hook]

Man, the mac
Keep my hand on the mac like Mad Max
From that I got a bad back
Gat least a half of shack off the gun rack
Just keep where I’m at, under the raps
That’s the catch ol' chap
Don’t make me go inside the backpack
Then you can hold that, lick the Bozak
