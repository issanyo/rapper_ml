[Intro]
The peddling of dope is a business
And business methods (Yeah)
Are used, including (Moss)
The "free sample" to bring in the new customer
The take is [Inaudible] fantastic. (Hm)
An estimated two thousand peddlers in New York (Raw)
City alone gross at least (Straight up')
One hundred million dollars annually. (Uh)
Federal narcotics agents agree [Inaudible]
That an international dope network (Check it) exists (Ah)

[Verse 1]
Fields of kush, a strain, Barbara Bush
Lay in the cut like a rook, play it by the book
For hard looks, let 'em cook, his frame shook
Before he stood his firstborn grew a foot
Time moves slow, the mind moves quicker
Your bitches'll slide, my rhyme is a scripture
Never take shit for granted, spliffs vanish
Hit the dancers, Dorothy Dandridge, Irene Cara
On a platter, she gagged on the bladder
I smeared her mascara and flashed to Nevada
Pull out the pump, let it sneeze once
Put the ax to your back like tree trunk
Niggas had a brief run, the shit was sweet as a Capri Sun
Kid Capri, peach fuzz
Your bitch lick the pre-cum right off the D-cups
My nuts hang like ribs in a meat truck
Shots of Henny in a teacup, I'm too clean-cut
The shoulder strap come with a machine gun

[Verse 2]
Red dots, headshots, we fled from the cops
Whip the fish up in the kitchen with the pots
Stop slingin' rock, think out the box
Sip the lifegiving drink of the gods
Lit cigars, I'm on the guard with the squad
The gun come with a tripod
Diamond heart, the mind is a firearm
Ride 'til the tires is bald
The walls that surround your empire fall
The five is an iron horse
In a whore I see a resource
As I recall since back when Dominique was a Hawk
The rap magnate, jacket's made of snake
The cash at a rapid pace like the way rabbits mate
Crack the safe that's an accolade
Relax and get face from Christina Applegate
Captivate, hold the Mac straight, spray it
Legs levitated, your family is devastated
