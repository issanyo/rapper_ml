[Intro: Crooked I]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Hook]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Blowing smoke out the Audi
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Blowing smoke out the Audi
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Blowing smoke out the Audi
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Stray the dames, great capillaries
Caress fatties, piggy ray canary
Cuban lane Miami
Virgin Mary turn a purple caddy
Gary sweet callin' purple candy
Talking bird out of the panties
Swallow brandy, I fly to where Sandy
You lay south up in your camp
Be like glam me
Old hammer blammer AT, melt some
Cans ,a bottle of wine, I set the belt buckles
The bare I hustle, had the snout lustful
Blow the spot like a mushroom
And takin' the truck fumes
I taste the crushed food, drink a cup full
Display the Jacob on the cuff too
My gain is plush blue
My waste day on a bus rule
My butt laying in a plush coup, fuck you
My butt laying in a plush coup like fuck you

[Hook]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Cali niggas drive the meanest chargers
We Robin Hoods like the English archer
Pouring our liquor for the deceased departure
Tell the Grim Reaper that we his partners
Cut the grass low, you snake niggas meet your gardeners
Gun sleeping in my waist, don't awake my stainless
You interrupt his power nap, he gonna make you famous
It took a long time for the world to let me display my cadence
Like a hospital chaplain, I had to pray for patience
It's all scientific, my mind's higher lifted
I wrote note thy self in the Pyramids and hieroglyphics
I steal fire biscuits, street soldier I enlisted
I will end your world in 2012 don't get the Mayans twisted
Promethazine and vodka that's the gasoline bottle
I'm blowing cigar smoke on a show magazine model
That Ferrari squat, she has a scene throttle
It cost an arm and a leg, the amputee auto
About my loots so lieutenants want to recruit me
But generals already absolutely salute me

[Hook]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Outro]
It's all love
It's all love
