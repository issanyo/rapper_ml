[Intro]

[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Marvel at the marble, marvelous mahogany floors
I need mosaics on the vases, evasive
Faces of Medusa what I'm used to, complacent
Sharp as a lance, on point like a lancet
Enhancements, handmade ceramics antique standards
Speaking Spanish, a patient man's antics
Reserved parking spots in the lots behind behind the annex
Bands for the buffies alias upon my amex
She begging me to trust her on a hammock popping xanax
The money was the buffer that absorbed the most damage
Unscathed, Willie not a scratch upon my armour
Sipping Arnold Palmer camouflaging, karma came to get me
Get me Guatemalan bitches, we in the Galapagos
Guava in my vodka, some guap for the zapatos, throwed
Humping hoes, my humble abode
Twin wood grain refrigerators, stainsless steel stoves
Sterling silver silverware, I'm dancing on these bitches
New beamers, semi-automatics in the Bally
Duffle definite, hustle more steam muscles pay the mortgage
Money orders Corrlinks, push button Porsches
Portraits, gorgeous
Scary like the mortuary terrace, carry grudges like the rabies
Reliable blades, rap rabbi, double chop ribeye
Live from Roppongi, you punk motherfuckers, (my) chain
Dangle like a bungee cord, whores fall to my feet
Undefeated, undisputed, deeply rooted

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Ayo this spliff look like a shrimp with a shit
Spent a grip on the droptop whip with the lip
If I was black my waves would spin
Better than a day would win
Got the burnt autumn follicles engraved in chin
My knife-work like Hiroyuki Sakai
Vocals got me all expenses paid, boat trips to Dubai
Fly Emirates, now the shorty's thighs spreading
On bedding, they got a hundred thousands threading counts
It's 10am and I'm already on my seventh ounce
10:30 I be up inside my pigeon's house
When it strikes noon, light the flute
Bite the fruit, inspired by the loot
Throw your mamma off the roof
Then got upset cause I spill soda on my shoe
These are shark, now I guess I gotta wear 'em to the park
While I'm shooting jumpers with the arc

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Olive oil voice, poise
Pipe the Caucasoid, until the whore make a joyful noise
Fill the void, my head embroidered in the coin
The gun and the groin interjoin
I moist the woman's loins, Helen of Troy, I’m a sex toy
Mama’s boy, foreign car convoy
The chrome of the alloy, annoy that's an asteroid
To bring the black boy laughter and joy
Hoping in Utopia, the flow this is opium
You bagging bush weed, I'm clone like a Kush seed
You fleed as the bullets are freed at good foot speed
And breeze, the need to see you bleed is appeased
Victory is seized, the displeased live with the disease
Please give me 40 feet like a centipede
Look distinctive, the link that's a nigga trinket
My slut twenty-five she lust to be fingered
Lick off a shot, call it cunnilingus
Kinda cunning, we've come to an agreement

[Outro]
Sign off on that in the morning
It all looks good
My lawyer's talking right
About 700,00
