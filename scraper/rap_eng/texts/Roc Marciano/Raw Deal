[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
I said slow drag 'em, yeah, this is how you go platinum
Chrome magnum, rollin' in my gold Aston
Blow past 'em, ask 'em cold smashin'
Rope and gag 'em, wrote classics, broke glasses
Closed caskets, foes asses get blasted
Sick bastards, thick gashes over lasses
Molasses, put you where the trash is, you're plastic
Below average, tryin' to come at this, savage
Black sabbath, maverick, Caliphate's back faggot
Ten gallon hat, horseback gallop
From here to Dallas, my style is hard like callous
Most ya'll rappers can toss my salad (bitch)

[Hook]
For all the real, hard to kill
Hardbody build, wheels run a quarter mil
Chillin' at the crib out in Forest Hills
Whores from Brazil, tryin' to steal chlorophyll (green)
My aura still got more appeal
Big bills on the floor spill
Now that it's on let the fours peel
Motherfucker you catch a raw deal, you catch a raw deal

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
My shit is ringin' like two for five
Or you can get your order supersized, hop in the coupe and drive (leave)
Guys scrutinize, we came through in Saabs
Overcome the odds, rollin' in somethin' hard
Keep the gun in my London Fog, livin' high off the hog
And tearin' shines off frauds
You're all hittin' the wrong chords, live in dischord
So I throw D's on the toy like I'm Rich Boy
Some saw it comin', but now I'm off and runnin'
More stunnin', niggas I'm sonnin'
Fresh out the dungeon, bitch, don't let the sun in we gettin' blunted
Bud seven hundred of onion red hairs on it
For that dope we dance like Fred Astaire on it
Patent leather red Air Forces, yeah it's gorgeous
Self portraits of bosses at the office
Bangin' young Kate Mosses, resources
Twin Porsches, all black like soy sauce is
Peel quicker than Earl Boykins
Niggas ain't got too many choices
So I keep pearls like oysters, and ride around in Rolls Royces
I hear voices at the fortress
I held the bomb detonator like a joystick
Blow up a bitch and her boyfriend in the toy Benz
Destroy-in ball point pens enjoy shrimp

[Hook]
For all the real, hard to kill
Hardbody build, wheels run a quarter mil
Chillin' at the crib out in Forest Hills
Whores from Brazil, tryin' to steal chlorophyll (green)
My aura still got more appeal
Big bills on the floor spill
Now that it's on let the fours peel
Motherfucker you catch a raw deal, you catch a raw deal
