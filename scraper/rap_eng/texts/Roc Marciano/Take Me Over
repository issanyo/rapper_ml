[Verse One]
Real shit
I still got one foot in the booth, the other on the strip
Uh, catch me where there's loot to get
The coupe come with the lip, niggas talkin' that bullshit
If it ain't a buck in it, then I can't fuck with it
Get money, fuck bitches
Whether hustlin' on benches or pimpin'
Ain't no pension, keep a Jewish nigga penny-pinchin' (get your hand out my pocket nigga)
Yeah, sloppily niggas copy my intellectual property
Papi, this isn't pie this is poppy seed
My hair curly like im papi's seed
Cock a 30 back, pop your knee
Motherfucker

[Sampled Hook x2]

[Verse Two]
Forever hustle, money
Never not gon' need it
See me in that big boy, ma I'm leanin'
Smokin' something for the time being
Bitch I only ride European
Uh, no denying I'm a pimp
Fuck lying to the kids, gotta get it how ya live
Cavalli be that land silk
Flyin' in the wind, keep a shotty at the crib
Square niggas talk square business
We got hammers with hairpin triggers
Uh, only live hoes no scared bitches
Niggas cut corners like hair trimmers
