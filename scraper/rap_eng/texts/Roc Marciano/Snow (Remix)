[Intro: Sean Price]
Who you been around nigga?
Chain snatching, maricon mother fuckers {Alejandro}{PEEEE}
Roc Marc what's good?
Brownsville in the building
Sean Nice {HAHHAH}

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
They call me Sean the sket harming ya', Fuck that
They call me Sean the sket alarming ya
Sean the vet, warning ya
Sean'll grab the chrome  and bump medulla oblongata
Not a nigga that ya know, flow is iller word to mama {Ugh}
I'm in a whole different space call it Andromeda
Battlestar Galactic, with the ratchet I will llama ya' {Ugh}
Understand nigga the flow ill
You should know by now, nigga Angela Bofill
No jerk, I blow purp
Captain America logo in front of the 'Lo shirt
You can't sell drugs with no work
Manicured fingernails, niggas did no dirt
Nigga respect my conglomerate
'Fore I run in your crib, some TEC to ya momma shit
Time for change get the fuck off Obama dick
P for president nigga I know a lot of shit

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
You just a consumer
One Ruger, son's a shooter
None truer, we bump to a
Lines & hooks reel in tuna
Shines are booked
Lives are took, we die sooner
Y'all manure why try and tutor
Put knives through ya
We gut guys from rooter to tooter
That's dry humor we don't buy Puma
Or drive Cougars but my tool's the size of a tuba
{Ungh} I'm the future it's no lie or rumor
Try and maneuver when I fire the bazooka
Child abuser, mama was a user
Slung crack, wasn't a good shooter like a Hoosier
Overachiever blood spill over a liter
You get rolled like a pita, over cheeba
Chrome heater 'Lo no La Tigre
My bone feeder, she fetch it like a golden retriever

[Hook: Roc Marciano]{x2}
Snow, let's go
Finesse the flow
Fresh, dressed from head to toe
Let 'em know, on with the show
We used to play the corner for dough
Rain... Hail... Snow...
