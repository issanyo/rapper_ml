[Intro]
Yeah nigga
Yall niggas is happy to be here nigga
We makin' history, lemme get a light *lighter sparks*
Fuck you niggas talkin bout nigga
Niggas gotta go baby
Death is just part of life
Believe it nigga
Make space cocksucka
We all gotta die but you goin before though me nigga

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Chrome magnum, live primitive, Cro-Magnon
The oldest lineage, the coldest of flow patterns
Broke addicts, coke habits, savage
I'm in the cold with no jacket
Push the bitch magnet, with the modern Mac in the back
Dipped the Yacht-master in platinum
Uh, sent to Christ one frigid night
Your skin's bitten by mice, you sniff the white off the invite
His wife like the end of the knife
My life stereotyped
Why ice took rap to new heights
That entice thick woman in tights
Cloud ya optics, you plug no power socket
Down lock it, with more tricks than a clowns pocket
Brown leather seats sweet chocolate
Freeze watches, I shoulda opened up my pimp chakras
Push the plush Acura with the character
They thought I had to add the flux capacitor
I'm back from the future, my aura is fuchsia
The rollie face all Medusa
Record next door to Lucifer
I escape thru the time warps, tubular
High pulse, squeeze all kind of toast
Release your soul into the cosmos
Step on the cockroach....shit...cocksucka!
Spread the fuckin word nigga metal

[Verse 2: Ka]
Demi-God, without the semi still plenty hard
Invoke opium-soaked quotes, many nod
Bread in the gutter I utter it should be
Better than butter i'ma cut of the good brie
Don't look fraud, a big dog if you ain't hood flee (flea)
See me scratchin faster than times were vigorous
Kept format in mind when all that shine was frivolous
Crime indigenous design rhymes of ominous
Heavy tolls, bury those we find ain't diggin' us
Game on, say its on blocks need a chorus
Born to ride corner's lock cops keying on us
My young stans get it now one chance
Crook apathy like Butch Cassidy (Sundance)
Brazen, not big into behavin'
Triggers we was blazin' nigga livin like a pagan
Nightimes shaved our lifelines, squads bleed
I pray the demons slow, Godspeed
They commit harsh deeds even if Pa plea
Counters to my brother capture
I keep my heart free
I cut rap another chapter, i'm a hard read
