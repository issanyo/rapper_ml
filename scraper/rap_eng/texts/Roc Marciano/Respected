Peep my garage, three sixes yeah that's the demon code
Be it so, I'm not evil though (haha ugh)

Bone to pick, oh, who you? Me?

Shit is big
My nig these cigs get lit with burned C-notes

Peep the steelo, peep the scene mo'
Moskinos, limosines, & speed boats (Grunt!)

Money counters on the counters, Thom Browne trousers to tuck the Browning with diamonds bust your rolly down it's crowded
