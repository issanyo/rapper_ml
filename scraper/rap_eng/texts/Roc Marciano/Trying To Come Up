[Verse 1 - Boldy James]

It's been a long hard struggle
And an even longer grind
Since I learnt how to hustle
I've been eating off the rind
In the concrete jungle
Where they feed you to the lions
Early nigga getting money
'Sides Heemie and Laron
On the Southfield service drive
North M Thirty Nine
Percy the Prince of Persia
Cheese, he the don
And [?] keep the nine
I'm pretty sure once before
You dun met my neighbours
Now it's time to meet the Cons
In these streets mainline, it's mafia what else
It make [?] that's a honor of [?]
Hundred thousand doller bill
Nigga this shit is real
Tryna bond out of jail on 10 per cent of a mil'
When you looking at an L getting blamed
For everything under the sun
Except the niggas that you killed
Sitting in my cell thinking bout the hit
Now everytime I dream about the shit i get the chills
Waking up in hot sweats gripping steel
Living in the projects missing meals
Eating a gas station combo that's a cigarill'
Pack of squares, some [?] and a ginger ale
But now I'm tipping scales
[?] coming in the mail
And at the end of the day, I'm tryna pin a tail
I got that white girl and I don't kiss and tell

[Chorus - Sample]

I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up

[Verse 2 - Roc Marciano]

Blunt and the coke
The cribs cold the furnace is broke
Young niggas turning coat but I'm awoke
See C-Notes the dream was to flea to Rio
With something mean speak Creole
My ambition, Christian Dior, Valentino
Ski on a kilo, my tee is fitted like a guido
Still get that VO on the D-low
Steamboats, linen blowing
Skin be glowing niggas chest showing
I'm not a limp pop in the clip
Hollows with the copper tip
Street politics, them niggas old
The fifth will show, my shit is like a fishing pole
Play the grave shift
Blaze spliffs with the suede kicks
My asian bitch in the whip
Wait patient while I'm throwing dice
Over Nikes, frozen ice
Cold bites, your partners is fed to the mice
Wet the carpet, your carcass is super market
Bull dog come out the shooters harness
Your arm spit? Nah never left your armpit
Surrounded by fiends this shit is like a mosh pit
They raided the crib, the guage is near the bed
While I jump out the window and break a leg
I'm too cold to break a sweat, wait next
The weight is wet, the weeds laced with wet
The D's chase, squeeze eights, escape death
Take steps, playing with cakes is like russian roulette
The touch or bump ways to connect
Your men could take it to the neck, take a bet
Spray the tec with no bayonet
Evade the net, pay the debt
Never slept nigga

[Chorus - Sample]

I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
I had a hard time in life, trying to come up
