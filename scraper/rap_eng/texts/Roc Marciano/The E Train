[Intro]
Brra, brra, uh

[Verse]
Frozen jewels, only fuck with hoes that choose
Catch me rolling, holding tools
I was home from dues, that’s all of that provoking dudes
I’m still focused on before
Homie, you fool, you like some tofu
Might let you hold a few out the old school
Like they do in the old school, like a true goon supposed to
Shit niggas go through when you anti-social, with fancy vocals
Can’t you see like total, we gon’ blow like Whole Foods
Homie, we been mobile, told you, bro, that’s what moguls do
By some, I been told I’m a total douche, uh
Cop the Ghost, now my homies spooked, boo
Uh, I jumped out the booth with no shoes
Walked on the water in the pool, came in the crib dry
Did I forget to mention that it was pouring too?
Bitches like, “Aren’t you the type to spend car loot on a army suit?
How you so rugged, but R&B smooth?”
One of the best to ever do this
Records with me is definitely on every MC’s to do list, uh
Boosting shrimps at Ruth’s Chris, new Gucci shoe prints
Goops dookie licks, we not stupid, pimp, I know what my duty is
You shot in the gluteus, where your goonies went?
Niggas dipped on you like word is you had the cooties, kid
I’m schooling these kids, you don’t move me a bit
Every time I slipped out the game, niggas pulled me back in
Marc
Uh, I’m still that rare type daddy, eep that pipe, that Mariah Carey
Life’s a bitch, but I’m not the type to marry
Wipe the white Ballys, what your writing’s like to me like a rice patty
Get at me, that’s like white in a baggy
Come with that bag and make it snappy
Or drag your feet up, mask be savvy
Marc, baby

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, just ride out
Uh, okay, uh, Marc, nigga
You already know, boy, hundred block
