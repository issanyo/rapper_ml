[Intro]
[Roc Marciano:] Preach
[Bishop Don Majic Juan:]
I tried to work man, but it just wasn't in my blood
It wasn't my thing, I tried
I mean I tried, but it really wasn't my thing

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Words from that good bishop, I'm a outcast
I don't fit in the system
My outfit, furry like a house pet
Italian leather couch set
Stepping out, something stretched out
Limousine shit
Twist the green shit, purple lean sip
Triple beam shit, this that Master P shit
Ice cream shit
Got it sewn like a seamstress
Linen sleeveless
Only linen clean shit, European dream shit
Fuck niggas, let the cream flip
Let the fiends hit
Nina with that beam spit
Leave you like steamed fish
Squeeze clips out the clean six
Niggas seem slick
...muhfucka you ain't seen shit
Marci nigga

[Hook:]
Niggas wanna come and hang on some mary jane
Champagne, gripping woodgrain
I'm still insane []
On the way, on the way
I keep a bitch on the stroll
Even when its cold
Stay after that pot of gold, oh
You know the goal
We getting dough-ooh-ooh
I used to slang blow, stay on the low
The po-po came to kick in my door
I don't know which way to go
I don't know which way to go
Can't escape my past, jakes on my ass
I grab my cash, I'm running fast
Foot on the gas, fuck your bitch ass
And I'm gone
I used to slang blow sting on the low
The po-po came to kick in my door
I don't know which way to go
I don't know which way to go

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Ice cream, ice cream
Fiends want that ice cream
Started as a pipe dream
Now I'm in that white thing
Bitches in them tight jeans
A nice scene
Two bricks of that white thing
Cop a Glock 19, it's light green
Bitch get on the right team
[] barely 19
Hoes under my right wing
Fuck her good, she might scream
Teach her bout what life mean
Ain't nothing in life free
Bullet pull up nicely
Ooh I think she likes me
But I ain't suprised though
Eyes low, clip the hydro
A fly ho, got more up in my condo
The combo, diamonds out the Congo
The nine blow with the long nose
Call it Gonzo
Put the nozzle to your pie-hole
Swerve at the pothole
Blindfold, quit the rosco
Hit the block slow, play the foxhole
Watch the slideshow, bezel on my watch glow
Plus I got dough, niggas know
