[Intro:]
I had a lot of brushes with the law
I was a dedicated member to my gang
And I did everything that teenagers do
Who are in that environment, at that age

[Verse 1:] [Roc Marciano]
We came up
Cookin' 'caine up
Vowed to never get the game up
Bust guns, never aim up (uh)
My grain is rough
My brain is plush
Grapes is crushed
Blunts laced with angel dust
Play the angles
Throw slugs in the air like singles
A light trinkle
The presidential face i might sprinkle
You’ve already seen what the men do
Pimp suit gaze mint blue
10K for the choker, let it choke her
Control her brain with no MK Ultra
Play the Copacabana
Fendi bandana
Philander
Big dog minus the pet dander
Cuban link the pet panther
From L.A. to New Hampshire
Smoking cancer with the enhancer
Getting pampered out here in Tampa
Florida got the formula
We shot callers like Randolph and Mortimer

[Verse 2:] [Ka]
Here in Gotham "Is there a problem?" pizazz with a nina
Got a bone to pick
Click, blast at your femur
Bear my fair share of lashes in Medina
Concrete jungle is a crumble
Everywhere grass is greener
Tryna advance my standard’of life in the arena
As war pass more crassness in demeanor
As a boy, no joy
What sense in me smiling
Balling, intentionally fouling, events of me wildin'
Akh if not don’t mention the silence
Nice in the life, smite no empathy violence
On the cusp, got to trust in partners in crime
But when movin' immorally, loyalty is harder to find
Hug the snub, romancing the laser scope
No man’s an island I’m just tryna stay afloat
Better tread, hence [?] end up dead
Wet up tryna get a leg up like a pin up spread
My inner goal [Song fades out]
