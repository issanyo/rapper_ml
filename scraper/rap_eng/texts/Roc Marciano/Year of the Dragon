Gods gift is the birth of child, been bearing witness ever since my addiction to the mercantile
Souls suffer when the serpents wild
Easier to wear the mask, than to hide behind a perfect smile
When I entered the cold winter
I couldn't start my dreams off the bench, that exposed splinters
We rode renters, so I could talk slick on every other breath
Be a good father, how I make amends for mothers death
If I have to go gorilla, I can thump my chest
Born in a dragon fire year, scorned and laughed at wit jeers
Those the habits that I fear
When I pen a draft, call me shaft iron spear, no secret when the Nim makes the rats hide in fear, its clear
That where we from has been war torn and tattered
And art imitation, the highest form of flatter
Start liberation, break out of the norm patterns
Or be on the losing end once the eye of the storm gathers
A forecaster, prophesied, formed from dye casters
Alchemist out of Kemet, broke stones with five masters
That taught me how to read palms, psalms, and alms givin'
The roots of my people is strong and long livin'
Life, gets religion prolonged in wrong prisons, I can make or brake an atheist, snakes, they song hissin', listen
This is precision piston, German engineered
Thats deep and metaphorical, the oracle appeared geared
Towards mo substance, Im writin' for Joe Public
His family low-budget, one chicken makes fo' lunches
Told my son, ive been around the sun 38 times
Around the slums, seen drugs, disintegrate  minds
All I can do is pray he takes time
And make him walk a straight line, if I see shape in his spine
Cure the scoliosis with focus, what my approach is
I never get noticed as being one of the dopest
With all due respect to the millennial mix
Your boys bicentennial, I was born in 1976..
