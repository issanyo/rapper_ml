[Hook]
I don't wanna do it, gotta do it
They gotta use it
Go get the powder, move it

[Verse 1]
Used to chip it at the lab
Bag, to flip it on the ave
Every trip I'm like, "This one is the last"
Two weeks later, I'm dippin' in my stash
Back to the krill again, feelin' thin
If you doing it to eat, is it still a sin?
Used to feel bad, but then in short time was like
"Fuck your family, someone got rich off mine"
That's the truth, dinner was instant soups
Those under my roof put dudes in expensive coupes
I was bitter as the ripest lime
And saw that only niggas living lived a life of crime
Jumper wasn't wet enough
Too rushed to write a rhyme
Since I was the only son, it was time to shine
Made sense to deliver and seal for a dollar sign
The figures I did to move to improve my bottom line
A drug connection naturally a thug's progression
To keep my faculties passionately hugged to weapon
With flaming aim, became the best in the gutter field
From the 'ville
But I wish I had another skill

[Hook]
I don't wanna do it, gotta do it
They gotta use it
Go get the powder, move it

[Verse 2]
I'm stuck to the path, reluctant
But just one touch of the cash corrupted
Got good at pulling strings like I master puppets
No feat too sweet, trying to amass this custard
Came into wealth, 'shamed of myself, past disgusted
But getting paid made for a fast adjustment
In this trade, ain't afraid to get splashed or busted
Even for small numbers, none are vastly trusted
I hushed it, heard my conscience in a clear voice
"Don't forsake us to make this a career choice"
Nights you try to slice your pie, you appear moist
But no wins if no sales so get it in gear and get hoist
Remember my thirst, dumb, young, and on the spree
My agenda at first, I wasn't even gonna read
Was firm as his turn, a couple hundred to a G
Shoulda stopped then, now locked in, coming for a key

[Hook]
I don't wanna do it, gotta do it
They gotta use it
Go get the powder, move it

[Outro]
Who's fuckin' with that?
Tell me, who's fuckin' with that?
That one hurt man, that one hurt
Can't capture those feelings, you had to live that shit
Real
