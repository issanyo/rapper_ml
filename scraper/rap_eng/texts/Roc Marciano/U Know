Verse 1 (Solace)
Underpromise and overdeliver
Steppin' to Timeless and get left holdin' your liver
Roll with the winners born sinners
Beg the lord will forgive us
Because we tired of them cold winters
Lukewarm dinners....
It's only the beginning, but we ain't no beginners
Hard for you to make claims and say you know this feeling
Our feet planted on the granite while you kneeling
Heat slanted for straigh killing
Stash up in the ceiling
That's half a million
Crashing your shindig and leave an imprint
Think big and win big, see that's the difference
Murder for that Murdoch money
Enlightenment that's woven in inside the writing
For your third eye, thunny
Fly jackets with mad patches like aviators
Surrender when the service rendered
Never let them pay me later
Gladiator, the cream color Bally be the Bailey flavor
Watch them friendly neighbors, study they behaviors
We Queens saviors kid, in here to take this...

[Chorus 2x]
Think you know? Nah son, Think Twice
Never seen kids on the mic that's this nice
Pens that write with the blood of Christ
Roll of the dice the way we live life

[Verse 2: Oprime39]
Rare pieces for all seasons you breath weakness
My presence the closest you get to meeting Jesus
No lottery I'm buying property on beaches
Camaraderies with Fortune 500s forming monopolies
Pop a cork, Panamera Porches, gorgeous
Guard the fortress you fucking with grown men
Stone grin the ammunition get flown in
This is the COLD WAVE we leaving you frozen
The chosen you vics for hunting season
Just for cheesin' Polo fleeces get taken like Liam Neeson
Blue Label Johnny, Purple Label trench
Time Truth play to win while you play the bench
Chasing ends like we gunning for the finish line
Bennetton treat the rhyme like it's dinner time
Scott Summer vision, keep the Polo vintage
This a scrimmage you with [amber alert] chillin in the village
Out in Queens you ain't lastin' like Milledge
Run with killers who pillage
Four wheelers with panoramic ceilings
Front with riches for bitches, your money tall as midgets
Crack a 40 for shorty trizzin' now she catching feelings...
You know the dealin's

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: Solace]
Claiming rap dudes on my W2s
Panoramic roof standard cruise, with the slammin' views
Toss the alley oop, rally troops, bet I'm nice
Leave'em hangin' like Vanilla Ice, never tell'em twice
We men of honour, dipped in the all Americana
Metal llama in the leather bomber
Knife specialist like Benny Hana
Turn hardbody brothers to hibachi when we settle drama
Jake got the place tapped like the Watergate (SCHEMING)
On the kid hopping out the quarter-eight (CATCH ME)
Sipping cabernet, catch a cab to the cabaret
Steady beaming like a gamma ray
Can't buy class but you can cop the lecture
Verbal architecture for that we charge'em extra
Cop the drop at the dock and I'm gone and ock
I keep it hot, blow the spot without warning
