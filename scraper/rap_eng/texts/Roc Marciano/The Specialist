Calico shooters, styrofoam noses
Neck full of boulders, red leather sofas
Bread with the toasters, Louis Vuitton coasters
Ball never needed culture, long heater poke
Whores seen us, up in the Porsche or the Beamer float
Once I let the 40 Colt cut your peanut open
My pinky ring frozen and my feet are soakin'
Bad Puerto Rican needed lotion
Gee it's potent, we rather be easy with the doses
Check [?] the goal is to drive Testarossas
And get mega cheddar like a Olson
Live by the ocean, got a lot of mail like postmen
Dollar dollar bill pop Mo's in
Pop hoes in like ibuprofen
And if I'm bein' quoted tell them niggas I'm reloadin'
The nine we holdin', throw your body out the Bonny rollin'
Yeah I just had a John Gotti moment
God forbid you discharge a pistol
On a pimp's arm like a arch extention
Park the Continental, strip you to your swimsuit
Stomp you out with the blonde Timb boot, skin's loose
Spillin' pimp juice, minks is new
Your bitch'll be gone like Leon Spinks tooth

A specialist
Obviously don't know who you F'in with
I did this shit effortless
Four hundred thousand for the watch and the neck-a-lace
Specialist

[scratched Prodigy hook]
Call me the specialist, professional professor at this rap science
Up in the laboratory

[Havoc scratch]
Reppin' up in this

Tales from a demon, bust shells at a heathen
Bobbin' and weavin', and see another evenin'
Thieves for the season, gotta do more than break even
Stress is givin' niggas grey caesars
Breezin' in fleeces, bitch it ain't all cream and peaches
You couldn't walk a day in these sneakers
Steak eaters, tires on the grey Jeep screeches
Cartier frames for the readers
Don Juanin', wine in the goblet
They tryin' to undermine all that I've accomplished
Designer carpets, them guys is profits
Rhymes is ostrich, lines is toxic
Murders is spotless, eighty thousand dollar watch tick
Them niggas got the nerve to try and pop shit
Hammers is on deck, cocksucker
Nine lined with rubber to fry blubber
I'm ridin' clean but my mind is in the gutter
Greyhound roller, tre pound holder
Round thrower, isotoners for the toters
Hoes know us, foes idle like a motor

Specialist
