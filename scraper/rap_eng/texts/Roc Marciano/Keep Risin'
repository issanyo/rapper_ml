Today we throwing on linen
Punks jump up and get holes all in em
Roll up the whole O no kiddin'
Purple haze, 2 keys, Nicole Kidman
No need to call police cause that's snitchin'
Bro listen
You flowing aight but still somethings missin'
Got a little skill and ambition
But you can't just have talent you got to have vision
These niggas is all rapping the same
Scared little boys with make believe names
Bring ya crew then I'll bring the gang
Ring ya neck
Till the color of your face change
Fuck being mainstream I'm raw
Twin mac 10's stashed in the Benz doors
Prince among thieves and 10 dollar whores
Do high speeds in the olive green Porsche
If you pull that gat you better squeeze off
Cut him down like Jack did the beanstalk
I don't have to ask to eat in this sport
I just sit down and put the meat on the fork
