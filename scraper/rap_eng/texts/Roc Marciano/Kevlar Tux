Pimp, Shit
Machine, bitch)

[Verse 1, Conway The Machine]
Look
Smoking sour with Sonnyjim (We smokin')
Supreme duffel just to throw the money in (Ah!)
Free my nigga, the judge done him in (Free my nigga!)
Gave him twenty years
That was back in 2010
Fuck it, when he come home
He gone fucking win (He good)
Niggas gonna hate to see my nigga run it up again
Hopping out that transformer, [?]
You niggas get stupid, you gone lose a fucking limb
Ayo, you fucking with a legend (Right, right, right...)
Machine, bitch
You better fucking get your weapon and spray
'Cause I don't play
That K from far away
I'm shooting, long distance
[?] clay, shout out to bae
I spray
Get out the way
I promise niggas gone pay
50 shot, bananas, my nigga
You better pray
I don't catch you
(Boom, boom)
Two to the head so they know that it was me that left you (Haaa!)
Machine, bitch, ha

[Verse 2, Roc Marciano]
Midnight blue, [?]
Threw the beam on the pump
Made the shotty look kind of stocky
Let off a shot, blew a chunk of hide out your thigh meat
[Whilst you up?] probably tidy up your hygiene
'Stay fly' is the ideology
[?]
I'm a different kind of breed, I have you lined and bodied
Had your mami behind me, soul, mind and body
[?]
I'm looking like Gotti to all my colleagues
Spend a dime [?] dry clean
[?] ride or die gene [?]
The [?] 5 50
[?] Constantine
It's a common theme
[?] wings
Like some [?]
The chopper make you niggas bob and weave
I believe I'm like a God to these [?]
They wanna copy the key but I got it locked deep
