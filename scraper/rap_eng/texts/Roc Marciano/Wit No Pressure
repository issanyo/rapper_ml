With no pressure, five birds thrown in the compressor
[???], silk shirts in the leather dresser
My predecessor's on a stretcher
Cuban heiffer, finesse her like I'm Hugh Hefner
Possess her, candy apple red Tesla
Check the texture, silky as my connect' Hector
With Malcolm X on the projector
Cognac, fuck in every sex position in the zodiac
Smooth like the way Goldy act
Send a ho at your ass, you wake up like 'yo where my rollie at'
Protect the homies with the goalie mask
Then mosie past, and bust the same guns Monster Kody blast
You rockin ponies with your phony ass
You know me as, I don't even give Sauconys a pass
I'm complex like Napoleon has
I'm sittin cozy in Jags, you sittin lonely in a sodium bath
My bitch trophy, Hawaiian Sophie, waistline [????]
Lit up a bogie, your flow to me is karaoke
The pad is smoky and my back is soapy
My whole cult be like Aleister Crowley
Cats that know me know I blast toolies
And take baths with the uzi, slim bitch but her ass juicy
Y2c, two seats in the coupe soupy
Red top Danny Bonaduce

BBS, no BS, green CLS, P.S: my necklace VVS
V-necks, still got a sweet left
Shake your world up, yellin 'turn up'
Niggas'll send you home like a turnip
Dipped the L, lit the sherm up
Spliffs burn up, niggas turn up looking hurt up
Flip birds, kick dirt up, lick shots, split the herd up
The bullshit you're kickin don't concern us
I hold a MAC-10 like Vinny the Chin
My pen color Indian skin, tires on Milleniums spin
Back when I was skinny and thin
Wished death 'Many Men', I'm feelin like 50 Cent
My cowboy boots come with the six shooter
Chain from Cuba, my watch game Franck Muller
Peace to my jeweller, the black ruger, twist buddha
Hit the puma, better than later nigga sooner
