[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah
Marc, nigga, uh
You already know what we doing, nigga
Hold up, hold up
Uh, yeah, hold up, hold up

[Chorus]
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, ah
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, yeah
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, uh

[Verse]
I just caught a lick, I feel more than lit, uh
I just bought a whip, that was off the rip, uh
I do more than pimp, we not mortal men, uh
Niggas hating, I’m just saying suck a dick
Playing Purple Rain, racing in the Wraith
Breaking hoes for change, European taste, ay, ay
I just caught a lick, I just caught a brick
I just caught a wave, I could fuck your whore today
She do what I fucking say, like a puppet on the string
I just copped a couple minks, I’m a motherfucking king
Uh, ay, uh, king, uh
I’m quick to go pimp on a ho, put something big in her throat
This how this shit gonna go, I’m not with the rigamarole
I dip in the pole, watch for the dip in the road
This was a different approach, switching the poles, uh
I’m switching them hoes, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, ah
Uh, I’m more than lit, uh
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, ay, ay
I just caught a lick, caught a lick
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, uh
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick, uh
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick
I just caught a lick, I just caught a lick
