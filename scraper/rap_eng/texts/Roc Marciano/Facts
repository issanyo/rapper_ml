Eating good I got the love handles
White pearl on the gun handle
I don't like to talk I let the drum ramble
Dump a handful; jump in the Lambo
The sweater's handwoven; tan Land Rovers
Cut the Mercedes; Amber Rose it
These hoes is bowling pins any nigga with money knows it
They taking dick in every hole like honeymooners
Up in the room while it's moonlit
The Ballys boots turmeric
The ice on my ring is blue like a Hoover crip
Don't get it misconstrued homeslice
The tool I hold Manute Bol height
Kill rap I got new goals, my two new hoes white
I wipe my ass with Nikes
I done gave away more Nikes than Mike (Facts)
My life ain't sweet as Mike & Ikes
My Hector dice you up something nice
Sip the nectar it got electrolytes
We set the trends niggas follow
Check my lawn it got potholes
Freeze the grill might flood the bottom row
Wooden Ferragamo soles
The Alpha Romero Milano gold
Fuck you rocking Club Monaco? This a Prada coat
I don't acknowledge hoes; my silence spoke
Let off the lead and made the silencer smoke
Niggas pockets is broke I just went shopping with my chocolate hoe

Niggas is talking this and talking that
I'm just talking facts
I'm just talking cash

Niggas is talking this and talking that
I'm just talking facts
I'm just talking cash

Shit you rapping about get you slapped in the mouth
When niggas ride I jumped in with the bag of gats and passed them out
We go the fast route
I'm a cash cow
Milk the game till I bring the bag out
Backing out get you smoked like a Black & Mild
My Louie jacket black and brown
Give you half a round you ain't laughing now
My bitch's ass is round
Before we speak business my niggas had to put you down
My lady shoe shopping Rodeo Drive don't quit your day job
My whip drive like its made for James Bond
You ain't even on my radar
You get preyed on
Shot up and laid down like a stray dog
Praise the lord
Rob your train of thoughts
Sport the Range Sport
Hard work paid off, still my neighbors snort soft
