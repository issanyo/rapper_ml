[Verse 1: Mega of S.A.S.]
I'm tryna eat 'til I increase my bank's guap
'Til I'm obese and hopping out of that tan drop (rollin')
Invest like I was wearing a tank top
Since they all sheep I'll turn these fuckers to lamb chops
Create a major verse, my main concern
Watch the blazer burn plastic rappers to ashes
And make an urn (scoldin')
Wanna be luxury living? Wait your turn
Ballin'? They on a commission, David Stern
A scar on my face but no I ain't Al Pacino
I'm hotter than boarding flights to Puerto Rico with kilos
Roc Marci, Mayhem and Cito... we don't play
Leave that shit to a casino with me OK, aye, aye
I ain't the one you wanna stunt on
Fendi trench at any event, come on (reversible)
Pull the shottie out, then I buss rounds
So when you're hearing those buck shots just duck down

[Verse 2: Mayhem of S.A.S.]
Hot topic. Groupies gossip that i'm hot shit
My Moroccan chick that shop lifts always got bits
Average retailers wouldn't stop this
Off the top turnbuckles how I drop kicks
On my rock shit, I stage dive into mosh pits
So fly she takin' plane rides on my cockpit
Alien, fuck a slut from Terrace Projects!
In a unidentified foreign object!
80's poses, we squat for the cameras
I'm a bachelor, thirst is not in my character (suave)
So ill I should be quarantined
Now they fear me like I stepped outta horror scene
Fuck an iPod, I'm getting you touched
The weapon is tucked for any nigga steppin' to us
AK behind the painting, ready to buck
My new titles Count Runway, address me as such

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Uh, let the shotgun smoke, sprinkle the coke
Life's like a tight rope
It's nice to know the right white folk
Check and trap i'm like Kenny Red with the mouthpiece
Copped a house out in South Beach
Move powder with loud heat
Plow your hoe at the mo' like a foot of snow
It's like a free-throw, thousand dollar fee show, piece glow
Magnifico, keep a freak she from Puerto Rico
Sniff perico, with the fatty she petit though, deep throat
Coolin' out blowin' cubans with druids
My ice kinda blue-ish, Vuitton Louis, the newest, move fluent
Thread the needle with the Eagle, shoot it
Police feud it, my hate for D's is deep rooted
Dsquared ski wear, then leave your stare medium rare
Fuck being fair it's best to beware
Clap your tummy, crash dummy
I'm in that black thing sittin' lovely
Prettier than a bag of money, buddy
