Get your shit together
Tuck the 4-5th in the leather
Get to the cheddar just to live better
Get your sweater wet up
It felt like a set up
When it's on I won't let up
Till the lead tear your head up
Grown like men, shoot the head up
Nigga wit' us it's forever and ever
It's whateva whateva

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
True, now what's a man to do?
Scramble for loot, phantom in maroon
Standin' nude in the tanning room
I hand the tool to my ???
My hands are groomed like a pampered jewel
Not to mention I'm one handsome dude
Hold a candle to who? You're just a can of food
Come with the hammer draw a plan to lose
I dismantle your crew then BLAM you in the Marc Buchanan Blue
Turn the tube to channel two and there was you
Your parents just can't handle the news
I stare at the view hearin' the blues
It's more than rap, I'm wearin' the shoes
I brought the gat, who's wearing the jewels?
Now bring the cash out here to my dudes, ugh
I pop the air out your balloon and the spare too
If I ain't here doing the rearview of the vehicle
Or let the shear tear through, yeah true

Till the lead tear your head up
Grown like men, shoot the head up
Nigga wit' us it's forever and ever
It's whateva whateva

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
I'm through being nice
If we don't see alike you don't see the light
You be the type to leave the fight like fleeing mice
You're walking on a thin sheet of ice
From ten speed bikes to white G5s
My life is extra large like my tee size
You be in the seat tied, beat
Hit with the nine, lie, sleep
Time is money, pride and deceit
Lies and greed, despising the trees, cheese
Wives are cheap, grind in the sheets
Your enemies come disguised as your peeps
Lines that I read, foul to the teeth
Filed from a cheap, twenty five thousand a key
Niggas sound funny style to me
You'll get found in a pile of leaves, nigga

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Put the pain on a track
Put the name on the map
I put the flame on your back
Shotgun pellets'll rain on your hat
But is it the thrill of the chase or the catch?
The taste of 'gnac, the face in the mask?
The case of stacks, the range or the jag?
Nothin' but leather and suede on the ass
That's that skippy, woodgrain on the dash
The moment is here, I'm blowing a square
Close tear left roll in here
It got cold in there
Bonds are broken in pairs like shares
Nike airs, two shooters in a Cavalier
Casual gear, dabbled in the crack game
Fuck try'na be a tax payer
Flash paper, that's a gladiator
Daddy, rock that alligator, that's flavor
