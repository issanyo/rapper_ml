[Verse 1 : Roc Marciano]

Nights is cold, dynamite sold
Gigolo wardrobe, soft on stoves
Four doors close, whores on the stroll
War stories are told and fool's gold sold
Boss is thrown from four story homes
Porsches [?] is all we got on
Never wore Saucony's nor a pair of ponies
Rode [?] wearing Rolly's
Five pies no anchovies
Mack of the year, bitch I hold my trophy like Goldie
I knocked a row of Pretty Tony's Tenderoni's
Sent ten coyotes to run out to Wyoming
Like solitary rodent...
To smack you is an involuntary movement
But I get caught up in the moment
George "The Animal" Steele ya and kill ya
Peel silver and like a fat cow, milk ya
Spilt ya through a filter
Your fate is sealed i revealed ya
Filth to real is familiar
Real recognise realer
Don't play the hand, play the dealer
Wearing concealer and Tequila
She sniff a smear off a mirror and then spear ya
Yeah I hear ya...
(We do it)
Yeah I hear ya

[Chorus x 8]

We do it
W-w-we do it

[Verse 2 : Roc Marciano]

I mangle and mash, strangle that ass
Banged in the abs and laid in the trash
And sprayed with the mag
I came with the mask got eight in the cask
Escaped in the Jag but forty jakes came with the badge
The language is cash, explain to the mass
The angles in math, the angels in black to claim you and flash
You been a fag, i'll display you in drag
Disgrace you and tag, degrade you when you stable an axe
Then give your weak label an axe, sable and hack
The way you mack, you lose ankle fat
Get in the lab and make the table crack
I'm paying you back for the way you act
Then lay you flat you ungrateful rat
Just like a rectangle in Madden, men scat
You just a resthaven for ass, you don't wanna pimp
You just a trick like one of them
Iâ€™m from where the lovers of sin struggle to win
Spit 'til you covered in phlegm, enough to offend
Mothers and kids, nothing is above getting in
So bubble and [?]
Son don't wanna get pinched
Gun in my clinch, I'm running my sprints
You stuck on the bench
You swung on a limb, I hung on the strength
Get front on my grip
It's tight like the butt on a fish
You melt like the butter on grits
And won't get to sell a crumb on the strip
Unless I get a hundred per cent

[Chorus x 8]

We do it
W-w-we do it

[Verse 3 : Ka]

Move at night, the torch improve my sight
They plan that Ka bite the pie and I lose my life
Hammer's will blaze but not afraid to use the knife
'Fore it's blowing on I'm going to get some jewels of Christ
Forgive me, It's a pity I starved, I wasn't breast fed
Gritty niggas swear to god I'm right for my death bed
City of God, could be [?] before I nest egg
Way too witty to ever hear me say "let's beg"
They say he's possessed, yes he got the ghetto in him
My spit spread quick, no cure unless the little venom
[?] let the metal spin 'em
The public my puppet, fuck it watch Geppetto string 'em
From a better kingdom straight rap sound is regal
Those lost in the haystack, you just found the needle
All praise due to the sky so the ground receive you
Bow, give a pound when we live in the crowd, we see you

[Chorus x 8]

We do it
W-w-we do it
