The money game... gun play...
Prolly learn one day...
Don't get it twisted shorty
I'm still ready for whatever though
Bitch I'mma let em' know..
You know it's all about the money game..gun play..
You'll prolly learn one day..

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Uh
Burned the candle in the flannel
Burner with the pearl handle
Slanted up on the mantle (Woo)
Murder weapon is dismantled
I'm on a different channel
Your clique is buried out in San Leandro
Where the sand blow
I hold the pump like a banjo
That's word to Marlon Brando
Uh
Stylin' in linen
Beguiling the women
To bless her foot, I might sacrifice a lizard (Kill it)
Rock the 40 belows when it's rigid
The work, used to water whip it, in my momma kitchen (Whip it)
Writing compositions
White Walle's with the blue stitching
My heir scooped the beautician

I hold the snub, like rose buds
Wine baths, in the gold tub
Grow the drugs, sleep snug
Love is love
Throw a couple slugs
I let em fly like doves

Stay the course
The Porsche come with dual exhaust
Found dead with one shoe off
I picked up a thought through a tuning fork
Ferragamo shoes on, looking smooth in court
Have manners, don't chew and talk
The deuce talk, I'm too New York, to not smooth talk
Lose nose turn Rudolph
Keep a ho to get loot off
I'm clean enough to eat food off

[Hook]
Don't get it fucked up ho
You know it's all about the money game...
Gunplay...
You'll prolly learn one day...

Don't get it twisted shorty
I'm still ready for whatever though
Bitch I'mma let 'em know
I could always get a better ho

[Verse 2]
Yo
A higher plateau
Chateau
The coke's in the glass bowl
Lavender bathrobe
I'm laughing at these assholes
It's a fiasco
Snatch your queen with the lasso (Yee-haw!)
I'm getting better by the minute
The 5 is tinted, you can't see me in it
Looking all self-centered
Sweet scented
My lyrics speak to the spirit
Cook beef in a skillet (Woo)

How you like yours
Bloody or burnt
The money is earned, the tables turn
Your body left an angel in the dirt
My jewels come with paperwork
These are the perks
But still I'm a introvert
Linen shirt
Peach hard-bottoms
Greek columns
Trees with Koalas
Drinks with the olives
Sniff a line a coke through a dollar
The sign of Mississippi Masala
The process is too advanced
My pimp stance
Attract tramps
Tight pants
Drive the Cayenne with the slant
Enchant bitches chant
The belt is with the champ
Nigga

[Hook]
