[Intro]
Back tomorrow, tho
Peace to cousin Jay
Hempstead
(Some die, some grow)
My nigga dre
Streets two, USA
Nitty, Yeah, Mars

[Verse 1]
Maserati buttermilk
Shirt silk, burst still
Get murk'd still
Putting work 'till
Watch the purse fill
Emerge from the dirt
Filled from this curse still
I pop a smurf pill, murder kill
I didn't work on the field
Burn Bill, get your sterning pill
You tryna earn a mil', the son of Will
Who did on film
Before you get a boat learn to sail
Coke sellers selth
Hoes in their beaks
Nigga, they're wholesellers
Check their coats and their belts
Gold on their dealts
Paid hoes, left wealths
Go for sealth, peace to Roosevelt
Niggas holding mel, blowing els
Rolling themselves
Is fish scale pale, in your grail
Sippin crystal, keep a pistol
Give the child, my bitch, a brick house
I was picked-out
Like an afro when is picked out
I did the big house
Left the quarters, wish you wing out
Change your lift now
While I am getting scalped-up in the penthouse
Five-percent style, prop a mental
Rock a-did-out, stood out
Counterfeiting let a spid out
You are not down in the hospital, get down
That's fit out
Some of us even had to sit down in the sit-out
Crack sittels, hat beetles and skittles
Oh while I get out, o what a out, o what a out

[Outro]
New York one up in the game
(Some die, some grow)
This world'll never be the same
(Some get high, some don't)
People tryna make his name
(Some rise, some fall)
New yolks tryna make a change
(On the grind, twenty-four)
New yolks one up in the game
(Some die, some grow)
This world'll never be the same
(Some get high, some don't)
People tryna make his names
(Some rise, some fall)
Here tryna make a world of change
(On the grind, twenty-four)
Black Math nice to get you my nigga
(These all wanna make a name)
Young Math, aha, yeah, you kno what it is
(This word'll never be the same)
Rest in Peace my nigga Nom
