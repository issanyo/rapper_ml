[Intro]
Uh, yeah, okay, the fuck
Marc, nigga, word to Muggs
Yeah, money and drugs
Yeah, for sure, though
Marc, nigga, uh, rah, rah, rah
Ah, what it do, nigga
You already know, boy, on your block
Pop your top, talk to ‘em, nigga
Uh

[Chorus]
Twist your wig, twist your wig, wig, huh
I twist your wig, twist your wig, huh
Twist your wig, twist your wig
I twist your wig, twist your wig, uh

[Verse 1]
Huh, I hold a TEC, you don’t pose a threat
Money, hoes, and clothes, bitch, you know the rest, uh
Whip, whip, whip, it’s in the wrist
I ball, bitch, everything I shoot go in the net, huh
With the fish, getting chips, uh I split your wig, split your wig, uh
I might cop myself a Benz, I’m about to be so fucking big
It was like when Kim was fucking BIG, woo
I should have on Brooklyn Mint, bitch, I look intense
This is shit that says that you’s a pimp
Your lady pulled the biz, but you wasn’t the advance
What she told this nigga, I’m just a friend
I prefer the fox furs
My posture like Kevin Costner, shrimp and lobster, uh
Drop top, flying spurs, we burners with the silencers
Boy, your future not looking promising, Marc, nigga

[Chorus]
Twist your wig, twist your wig, huh
I twist your wig, twist your wig, uh
Twist your wig, twist your wig
I twist your wig, twist your wig

[Verse 2]
Hitting corner up in the Rolls Royce Corniche, uh
Expensive homes with gold on the toilet
Hoes want enjoyment, I had to roll the joint and
I let both of ‘em join in, them bitches double jointed
BLS in the GL, I be fly, you ain’t leave the nest
I was fresh when they was boosting threads out the TSS
My bitch hold the heater like Mia X
We blessed, y’all possess less zest, uh
Burberry crest on the chest, uh
For that fetty, step on your neck, uh
You see my neck, we could never be neck and neck
I dead your connect and go get the new ‘Vette
My pet from Tribec’, she whip the blue Lex in the spoon dress
I had to get it, wasn’t spoon fed
Now all of my shoes and sweat specs have Medusa heads
Marc, nigga

[Chorus]
Twist your wig, twist your wig, huh
I twist your wig, twist your wig, uh
Twist your wig, twist your wig
I twist your wig, twist your wig
Twist your wig, twist your wig, huh
I twist your wig, twist your wig, uh
Twist your wig, twist your wig
I twist your wig, twist your wig
