[Verse One] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I gotta eat homie, I gotta make bread
This is America, shit look at K-Fed
Anyone with a dollar and dream can pocket cream
Sit and think of possible schemes
When I was young I had a paper route
I was a paper boy
20 years later haters, still countin' paper boy
Money talks so trust me, I'm makin' noise
People turn to slaves like Rich Pryor when he played The Toy
For that fast dollar, it take a lot of work
I'm on an island, water bluer than Papa Smurf
Bein' broke and bummy man, it's gotta hurt
I'm tryin' to cop a Benz before I cop a hearse
You can die for it
You will lie for it
Money make a bitch get on her knees and cry for it
We don't have the same vice as the rich
Cause without money homeboy your life is just shit
And that's real

[Scratch Hook]:
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays" - Mr. Lif
"All 4 The Cash" - Gang Starr
"The money, money"
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays"
"All 4 The Cash"
"The money, money"

[Verse Two] [El Da Sensei]:
Loot the root of all evil
Seen it dissolve people
And curse the feeble and the needy and the non equal
They ever paper chase green backs for luxury
Lavish lifestyle on a low budget fee
Some cats grind illegally and some straight
Most scrape to fill ends across lines, interstate
Unemployment leads to no enjoyment
Constant suffering from hard times spent
On the scramble, stick ups become casual
Unnatural thoughts for cream to make gradual
Tools bang steady for the come up and the cash out
Dice game, leave the dealer, Posse wanna Mash Out
Legal tender costs friends to enemies
Lady friends whisper "please", strictly on bent knees
Family never blends when they ask him for cheese
ATM receipts steady fallin' out my sleeves
It's like

[Scratch Hook]:
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays" - Mr. Lif
"All 4 The Cash" - Gang Starr
"The money, money"
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays"
"All 4 The Cash"
"The money, money"

[Verse Three] [Roc Marciano]:
I buy a pound or a brink on counterfeit
Keep powder to flip, push weight like a power lift
House shit
Two chains in the outfit
Outwit
Plug you with a gun like an outlet
Turn your town to the wild west
And count bread
? flow out the shower head
I'm just a con man nigga
Dollar flipper
White collar, killer
Common script I'll starve and pimp her
Put her out there and tell them tricks to park they Sentras
And our agenda is the larger tender
You're not hard to injure I'll part and bend ya
Gosh loves and the target interpardon the clip
Look like a cigar dispenser
Chandon pour it all on the whiskers
Come whisper when you see the larger picture
Nigga
