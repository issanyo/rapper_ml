WHAT! *echoing*

[Female singer]
Gotta get mine (gotta get miiiine)
Runnin' out of time (runnin' out of tiiime)
Gotta get mine (gotta get miiiine)
Runnin' out of time (runnin' out of tiiiiiiime)

[Bad Azz talikng]
All the motherfuckers who tellin' it's alright now
Ey,nothin' can stop us from doing our motherfuckin' thing
God dammit

[Verse 1]
From sunrise to sunset,one life one God
The universe and the rear out to the blocks they don't care about
Seein' hope till every hood fill with hopelessness
And hopelessness is enough to get the hustle back crackin'
Now you can tell the story to your friends back home
Back home they missin' "back" cuz a nigga been gone
So long,to all the homies that God called before me
Now without y'all here me and the homies gettin' lonely
Wonderin' who gon' the next to experience death
It get deep around here,fo' real hold your breath
Just thinkin' about ya lookin' at the stars as they glistenin'
It's hard to put the puzzle together with pieces missin'
In the places where the love is gone with no traces
Tryin' to eat of sellin' drugs,we goin' from catchin' cases upstate
To our concrete wars with sad faces and the freedom costs more
Than a House so we ain't sleepin'
I'm stuck tryin' to touch me a buck and can't grind
Cuz they ate us and the punk one time
I keep it strapped at the homegirls spot
If we get hot we get bad and give 'em all we got
We hittin' back,think twice about bringin' your gat
To where we at we nuthin' nice when it come to all that
And fuck a fight I'm too much in love with life
And gettin' cash and I don't know how long it's gon' last
You understand

[Hook]
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Just drinkin' this hot wine and dealin' with hard times
And keepin' my feet in shoes the horrible keepin' loose
It only shows me bad what happens ain't somethin' good
They funny cuz it's the money what happen off in the hood
They replaced the love with hate in different (?)
I tried to smell 'em and liked 'em and tried though again
Pills is equals(?) ???? where we goin' from here
Is what you showin' me ??? I only do what I fear
I got love for real niggas from here to over there
All my Long Beach niggas that keep it real enough to feel
All my Jersey niggas that keep it real enough to feel
You can feel cuz I'm real and I'm killin' just to live
With my New York niggas that keep it real enough to feel
All my Georgia niggas that keep it real enough to feel
All my Texas niggas that keep it real enough to feel
And Arizona they be killin' just to live
What!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From a helpless child to a hopeless man
I got bait that's overshadowed in this hopeless land
When money splits friends apart and broken hearts cause
Guns to spark when we pray it don't start
They say it's all bad but it's not,you see it's all good
When it could be that's really how it should be
It would be real (?) instead of (?) help each other to live
Knowin' how hard it is all of this is dedicated to y'all for life
One Love,my niggas get ya Thug on
It's a real cold to have to kill Just to live
And these Long Beach streets ain't really made for the kids
It's a real cold game to have to slang just to eat
In the lowdown shang(?) you got that thang just to sleep
See niggas like me we be real enough to feel
You can feel me cuz I'm real and I kill you just to live

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
California niggas we be killin' just to live
Cuz Chicago niggas they keep it real enough to feel
All my Oregon niggas the ones who killin' just to live
Cuz Loiusianna niggas keep it real
What about my Michigan niggas the ones who killin' just to live
Cuz in Arkansas they keep it real enough to feel
Down in Florida y'all they keep it real enough to feel
Out in Vegas they be killin' just to live
What!

[Hook]

[Bad Azz talking]
Imagine that,we got the whole world out here killin' just to live
That's a goddamn shame,you gotta get yourz I gotta get mine
Put a rush on it cuz we runnin' outta time
Ain't no time to waste,ain't no time to procrastinate
You better get on the good foot right now yeah,cuz later might be too late
Yeah we on a mad mission,take me up out of this bitch
