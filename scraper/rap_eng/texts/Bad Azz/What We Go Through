(Whats up Warren G?)
Whats happenin? I'm just chillin, you know
Checkin my game you dig, you know
Trippin off these fools around this situation here, you know its like that

[Mr. Malik]
I went from hustlin and slangin' to bustin and bangin
I got to keep it real, so fuck not cursin when I'm sangin'
Now let me tell y'all about this shit, went down the other night
Me and the doggs see some niggas, just caught up in the hype
Tryin to ride and get by like the FBI
Cause we know bout them hk's, they right outside
But we never knew y'all had a clue bout what we go through
So tell how the fuck could you speak on my crew

[Badass]
I went from dirt to large work like boatloads of keys
It's hard work and it hurts to live life on ya knees
So God please have a lil' mercy on my soul
What my eyes see, my mind think, my hand should hold
The outcome of these actions warm hearts turn cold
Lil' snake tryin' to blast me with the gun he stole
We hang out, banged out, same route as the day before
Blessed with perception, but don't know how my days a go
Could see my nigga hittin' with some pay, a few days ago

[Perfec]
Blaze up a flow, sit watch my paper grow
Cautious, in case niggas wanna cross this
But they can't cross me, I'm way too flossy
Out here making millions
All in with the villians
Let's turn these millions to trillions
I've seen it all pop slow unfold, and go
Now it's time to get mo' dough, ya know
I play under the wrath of thunder
Electric shocks hot as the summer
More foul than funner, gun ya
In the open range, man it seems strange
Even sometimes deranged inside my brain
I hold the key, identify then flee
Every MC close to me
Cause I'm supposed to be all in with my chips (nigga)
I'm all in with the crips and bloods
Grips for thugs, I nudge
The homie on his shoulder, cause every day I'm getting older
As the world turns and gets colder
Laid back I shot me sumpin', Perfec from dynamic, banging G-Funk

[Warren G]
Well I moved from the East to the West
Word on the street, niggas wanna test
But these MC's, is scared to buck
Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts
You fucking rookies
Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies
Ya hate me one minute and the next ya wanna buck me
He sent a ho, in the back seat of my fo'
While ya Going Back To Cali, watch how you flow
Now ya know, about this Warren G Era
G-Funk terror, look into the mirror
And what you see is the don of the company
That nigga, (Warren, Warren, Warren to the G)
You still see, what I see
All of the homies in the LB
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Locc and Bad Ass

(Chorus) x2
And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in the fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that, for me it's like that

Sittin back,and we makin the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass
Sittin back,and we makin the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass

Ya know what I'm sayin Warren G
With my homeboy from the pound Hershey Locc
And the homie Perfec, ya know what I'm saying and Mr. Badass
That's how we doing it fool, yeah
We ain't bangin on wacks nigga
Yeah we doing it like we should be fool, yeah
