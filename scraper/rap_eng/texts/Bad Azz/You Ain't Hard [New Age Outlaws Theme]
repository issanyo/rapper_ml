[Techniec]
Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah..
You heard of us..
New Age.. new page..
Ha ha ha.. yeah yeah y'all

New Age Outlaw, opposite Southpaw
Big water balloon balls and barroom brawls
The takedown, ain't nothin fake now
We earthquake towns, prepare for the shakedown
Try your luck - we aim to light it up
A million and one styles multiplied by a buck
Say it loud - pull out and spray the crowd
Wet'cha - only way you leave here is on a stretcher
I won't let'cha, get a hold of Tech
Hold a Tec, squeeze and fold your set
You loaded yet?  I'm already bustin let loose
Lose your neck, it's time you get used to Tech
You ain't gettin what you used to get, it's a new day
Kickin the do' down, Y-2-K
Whether you care to see it or care to believe
You'll get with beaten with bats until you paraplegic

Chorus: Techniec, Bad Azz

You ain't hard, you ain't tough
You little punks don't pump no fear in us -] (repeat 3X)
You ain't hard, you ain't tough
Is you hearin us?  You don't pump no fear in us

[Bad Azz]
See me, I ain't never lived a average life
I had the craziest days and the maddest nights
I wake up in a cold sweat, havin these fights
Then toss and turn in my sleep for the rest of the night
Wake up with my dukes on, scrappin again
Cause my life - is just one big fight
I remember when my momma used to say it was simple son
All you really gotta do is watch yo' temper
And stay away from trouble but I always invite it
It seemed like that same day I was fightin
Stressin shoulda figured I ain't had no patience
I stay in some wild physical confrontation
Yeah, that's how I got to ballin on y'all
We hit the bar, Techniec started a brawl
I slammed a man, he left out in ambulance
You heard the sirens, you disturbed by the violence?

Chorus

[T] You wanna, break the law then make it +Raw+
Jump off the turnbuckle and break your jaw
[B] Bump that Tech, let's crack some heads
Bust some backs, and break us some arms and legs
[T] Shake the Feds, they know Techniec got skill
Hop out the wheel, smash the club to your grill
I'm Outlaw, I been barred from the county
Tech and B-A-D gettin hunted by a bounty
[B] Man I, sell you a dream then throw you a ass-whoopin
You respect it when I check it and tell me that's good lookin
Attack him if he ain't ready and crack him with somethin heavy
He was dizzy when we dipped he thought the 'Llac was a Chevy
[T] Smack out in a cloud of smoke, heart drop
To a slow rate, stars round your head rotate
[B] No wait - let's him with this before we dip out
And await the next time these two young niggas trip out

Chorus
