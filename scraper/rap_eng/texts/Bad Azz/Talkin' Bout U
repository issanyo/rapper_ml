[Bad Azz]
Oh yeah I'm talkin' 'bout you
From birth to what you represent now
It's the truth, life on earth, it was Heaven sent down
It's just a test so he can see if you can live beyond the clouds
Behind the pearly gates, behind the swirly hate
I wanna get a chance to stroll on them golden rolls
But how can you dance?, the Devil's holdin' on your soul
See it's never what it looks like, it's always what it is
Me, I'm great, and I'ma help make the future for the kids
I await with lots of faith to see what it really is
And everybody wanna know about this Row run-in
I told Ray J "fuck Suge", he got the message
Now he mad like "Bad Azz, watch when we catch him"
I ran into him with his snakes and +Spyder+'s, they got beside us
Put they hands on Bad, I got ambitionz of a ridah
And Pac died fuckin' with you caught up in this game
Shit, everybody know it, they just all scared to say shit
Kurupt a fuckin' trader, he betrayed his country
I could really get started but I don't think you niggas want me

[Chorus] - 2X
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout hate
I'm talkin' 'bout crime, I'm talkin' 'bout my life
Talkin' 'bout them, talkin' 'bout sin
Talkin' 'bout me, (I'm talkin' 'bout my life)

[Konflict]
Who's really the bad guy?, who's ready to die?, really, c'mon
Tell me what's the price of livin' life freely
Never could I switch and change, I love the homies
Never could I snitch and leave the gang, fortune and fame
I'd rather be broke with my teammates, than rich with snakes
And still feel good and be respected through every hood
Look like you asked yourself
Don't you know fuckin' with the Devil bad for your health?
But Lord it look like they don't see
Wanna self-destruct, go ahead, that's where you're headed for bucks
Sell your soul, just watch where you go, no luck
Yeah these +Streetz Iz A Mutha+, the whole world's +Kurupt+
When the homies done lovin' you'll feel all alone, the love's gone
To me, it seems strange how the game is gone
Bustas yellin' "ride or die", heart showin' they true size
Blowin' dick like a bitch to get chips
How many licks do it take to get rich?
And if you really callin' shots around here
The homie Bad woulda never got jumped on around here
But now we know where your heart lay, don't try to conversate
And play slick like we gon' let that bullshit slide

[Chorus] - 2X
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout hate
I'm talkin' 'bout crime, I'm talkin' 'bout my life
Talkin' 'bout them, talkin' 'bout sin
Talkin' 'bout me, (I'm talkin' 'bout my life)

[Bad Azz]
It's been a minute since I first came in here
To win it I knew I had to watch myself around you snakes from the beginning
Never took my eyes off of the game, since I've been in it
You could rap but can't fuck with a thang that I be spittin'
I'm a man, I'ma ride for myself until I'm dead
And you foolish if you think I won't shoot you in the head
I ain't never had a friend like Pac
And don't we all wish that other motherfucker in the car got shot?
See everybody on Death Row just waitin' to die
It's like - sell your soul to Simon and just get in the line
I ain't one to let a black cloud cover my shine
I'm like Edison, I keep a bright light in my mind
They didn't - break my spirit, I just stay with my nine
And I don't own no vest 'cause God blessin' my life
And what's real, I live the truth for the rest of my life
And I'll kill you, that's real, you keep testin' my life

[Chorus] - 2X
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout hate
I'm talkin' 'bout crime, I'm talkin' 'bout my life
Talkin' 'bout them, talkin' 'bout sin
Talkin' 'bout me, (I'm talkin' 'bout my life)
