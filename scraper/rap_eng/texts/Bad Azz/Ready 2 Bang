We get Ready 2 Bang
That Dogghouse Gangsta Gang,Westcoast

[Verse 1]
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it cuz a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,when you workin' smart shit it don't flip right
Put the wrong ties and dees it won't slip right
Get the wrong blunt for the weed it won't hit right
And money don't grow on trees so what I look like
Make moves,can't lose if I do it that way
Fuck a fight,ain't nobody fin' to put they gat away
That's fast lane,lil' kids here to blow your head away
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Who got the cell phones for sale,who got it crackin' with the heat
Who got the club with the top shop and parks for cars
The Ese homies do the paint and body shop in the yard
Who got the hook-up with the burned out 2 way pagers
Can you give me a vest or a infrared laser
See me,I'm just a smart brother everything made for

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it cuz a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,fuck a few ki's move freight
And you doublin' your money if you take it upstate
Once you outta town get the prices on the pound
Shoot the number to your boy have him come on down
With a few of those who know money like y'all
All Lakers say is "Damn,y'all niggas is ballin"
Y'all back callin' all shots round here
Used to have to bring two Glocks round here
It's about five different gangs and the cops round here
And today Long Beach's about as crazy as it is
And maybe we'll live,every ever even see it
Believe it and how they get money ain't no secret
But they gon' try to keep it from you when they see you
Learn to keep on movin' you gon' see the tables keep on turnin'
First I was destined with no paper and no hoes
Now I got bitches in the show biz glow
So holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Don't let the green grab fool you tryin' to test me with some heat
Cuz bye bye you outta here,gone see you later
When I'm still here a small part outta everything major
