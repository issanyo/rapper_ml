Like it's one time
Grindin' in the California sunshine

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spittin' G block shit, we rock shit like cocaine
Hit the mean streets trippin' and dippin', servin' up whole thangs
Hot than a muthafucka
There goes the rival, you know the city's too small
Better know I'm liable, I'll take a strap up in the mall
No bullshit, illegal full clips
Got that dual shit, we be smokin' 'em up
You don't know enough, it's rough
If life was free, I would say "Fuck pussy!"
Nigga, don't push me, I'm an old-face killer, J. Voorhees
Even if it's bloody, more cheese
Smokin' hella pounds of weed
O.E. fuckin' up my gut but I'm as drunk as can be and eatin' raw meat
Reap what you sow
I got that heat that'll make you cold
Die at 21, nigga, fuck gettin' old
Money to fold, kill at shows, shootin' lead toes
Hit then split, don't trust no setup hoes, wet up clothes
Grindin' in this Killafornia sunshine
One 9, killer for hire, fuck money sometimes

[Chorus: Bad Azz]
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down

[Verse 2: Bad Azz]
Man, these wicked streets will drive a nigga insane
The weak'll cock back and put pistols to they brain
The weed, alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine's
The plot to break the strong down
To eat, you gotta cheat or break a law now
Fuck 'em, buck 'em all down
Y'all down? We can tear this muthafucka up again
Shootin', lootin', snatchin' people out they truck again
Fuck 'em then, muthafuckas wanna lock me up again
Have me stuck, stressin', writin' letters home from the pen
And man, fuck that, I'd rather be stuck back on my block
Sellin' rocks wit' a Glock, probably runnin' from the cops
Fuck one time, grindin' in the California sunshine
Where the motto's get rich, and bitch, fuck money sometimes
Runnin' numbers, rob the runners, get your bundles
Keep it comin', get it, get it, hollerin' "Money money money"
(Yeah, I'm down, nigga) Hollerin' "Money money money"

[Chorus: Bad Azz]
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down

[Verse 3: Bad Azz]
I live the life of a mobster
Catch us talkin' money, eatin' lobster
And life swallow niggas whole just like a monster
Your bones is the proof of death
Investigators later said he died a spooky death
And you don't even wanna hear how they said he died
Just as well, California's home for homicides
We dodge death all day tryna stay paid
And if our rivals don't come, then the cops don't raid
So if a nigga ain't high, you know we drunk as fuck
And if a nigga ain't rich, he's tryna touch a buck
We holla "Get it", hollerin' "Money money money"
(Yeah, I'm down, nigga) Hollerin' "Money money money"

[Chorus: Bad Azz]
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down
Like it's one time
Grindin' in this California sunshine
From L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down
Take a bird outta town on a Greyhound
Or serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down
