If you like what you see, make a move;
Get ya grind on, playa haters always lose
It's about fun, gettin' money, layin' in the cut
With everything you need, now what's up?

[Ras Kass]
It's the nigga you love to hate, '98;
Now how much cheese can one black nigga take?
Convertible Jag XK8 with customized plates
Playmates jumpin' out my birthday cake
See, we be on one, so raise the roof
Or we gon tear the club up, hoes in daisy dukes
I made you loose, orange juice mixed wit Hen tho';
I be doin' my thug thizzo, that's for shizzo
C-Arson baby, born and raised
Back in the KDAYs, when we was ba-bays
Now I get around like a circle
Squeezin' on ya lady's fat ass like a girdle
Latino cute, she was built somethin' fierce:
21, had her tongue and her bellybutton pierced
Playa, I think your wifey wanna politely bite me
Like Marv Albert, but that hurt, boo, blow lightly

[Hook: Ras Kass (Bad Azz)]
And all the ladies say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And all the hustlers say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And everybody say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)
And all the niggas say
(Get your grind on, just get your grind on)

[Ras Kass]
Let me take you back to the basics:
I smack a rapper's ass like a dominatrix
Life is screwfaces and misdemeanor cases
More chedda, the more better, family trump tight
Wit' my grandma dressin' all you chickens on fight night
I'm flossin' in Vegas like dream come true
Whippin' a '98 cream V 1-2
Of course, you be seein' me and one, two
I mean, three, laser-cut key, boo, one on Peachtree
One on Crenshaw, one on One Two Fifth
Walkin' in a B-Boy stance, holdin' my dick
I'm sick, flippin' scripts like Mxyzptlk on chicks
If they ridin' on my neezies like fleas and ticks
You need to just, catch us in the club, ten-drink minimum;
Freak 'em from the back, then I'm bendin 'em
And it don't stop, til the fat lady sing
But where Roseanne Barr at any way, know what I mean?

A material girl in a material world
Read her lips from 'cross the crowd, she said, "Gimme a whirl."
But you can have a piece of my love tonight;

I gets my swerve on like DUIs
True lies between two thighs, no shame in my game;

Tryin' to take over the world like Pinky and the Brain

Gotta get a lot o' CHiPs like Eric Estrada

And gotta get a lot o' hits like a fly swatter
Kick it to upscale hoochies, the ones who wear a thousand-dollar dress
And still got five on the stress
Don't get it twisted â€” why you over there lookin' at me
If you ain't comin' home tonight? Let's get it on tonight
Blame it on the Alize, Moet, the chronic, the mic and strobe lights
Yeah, I'm knowin'
That's why women keep they panty lines showin'
Grindin', and grindin' and grindin' ...

[Hook]
