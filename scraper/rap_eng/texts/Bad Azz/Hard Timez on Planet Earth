[Bad Azz - Chorus]
Damn man the block done got worst, we crying everyday out here
The value of the dollar getting messed, what type of medicine they got for this stress?
Hell yeah they'll send you in war but the mother fuckers won't defend you in court!
They'll kill you for defending your life, what good it make to try to fight for your right?
We be dying just trying to live better, good Lord what's it gonna take to get better?

[Big Tray Deee](Verse 1)
Yeah, I don't know but I'll tell you this...
From the 1 to the 10 we're presumed as guilty
Excluded quickly and removed from history
Teaching us by making free of us but never told us
What my people had established before y'all came and stoled us
Rowed us on a boat, shackled under the deck
And built a mother fucking country off of African sweat
And damned if I let em' keep a foot on my neck
They killed 'Pac, Biggie, Martin and Malcom X
I stay watching how you plottin not to let us win
But spare big buildings peds you can set us in
Let the niggas handle rocks, or get the mexicans, the blocks
Selling rocks to blacks is hot, shots occur and murders pop
Lock the niggas up and call the immigration truck
Kill two birds with one pluck and not a face seen once
Fuck em' cuz' they want us all planted in dirt
I'm getting mines cuz' it's "Hard Timez on Planet Earth"

[Bad Azz - Chorus]
Damn man the block done got worst, we crying everyday out here
The value of the dollar getting messed, what type of medicine they got for this stress?
Hell yeah they'll send you in war but the mother fuckers won't defend you in court!
They'll kill you for defending your life, what good it make to try to fight for your right?
We be dying just trying to live better, good Lord what's it gonna take to get better?

[Big Tray Deee](Verse 2)
They put a white face on our Jesus and Hell has pledged Allegiance
Infect us with diseases, for stressing weeks they feed us
Teaching their history and dirty shit they did to me
And guarantee a PhD will truly set a nigga free
But use computers just to lose us in the meaning
Creating more confusion just to take the place of humans
Assume that we just stupid when the truth is in the music
Just review what you will see before the unions' moving units
Adding flava to the state of entertainment, getting famous
Why you hating, waiting, stanking, sading taking us to Haities
Stop watch and listen,listen,pierce in this s'
Simply sent for me to spit to get some sense into this verbal scripture
Ain't no way to circumvent the purposes been written
And we'll never know the end and know exactly what we're spending
Spinning in a cycle of survival or the fittest
"Hard Timez on Planet Earth" and this is only the beginning!

[Bad Azz - Chorus]
Damn man the block done got worst, we crying everyday out here

Hell yeah they'll send you in war but the mother fuckers won't defend you in court!
