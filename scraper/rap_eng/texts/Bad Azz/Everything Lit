[Hook: Don Q]
I'll make sure everything lit (x4)

[Verse 1: Don Q]
First off I'm the effin' man
It just happened it was never planned
Hit the beach just to catch a tan
Louis flip flops when I step in sand
Bunch of bottles when I'm stepping in
They'll be stupid not to let us in
She's just looking for a wedding band
I make it ring, leave them wetting bands
Im high as fuck, I hope I never land
Petter Pan flow, but he's the man though
Search up once you leave the bando
They gon kill you if you take a gram hoe
Why would you wanna try
My window down when I'm coming by
I started off with a hundred dimes
I ran up that one-hundred, one-hundred times
I catch a body like I'm number nine
Say fuck the judge, nigga fuck the time
I see the hate but the love is blind
You're waiting for it, I just jumped the line
She called me cussin, man this hoe is buggin'
Because I got the plug on the other line
My stomach touching like is Ramadan
Theres still no love for the other side
I'll make sure everything lit
Everything, everything, everything lit
My roli shinning, nigga everything lit
My clothes designer, nigga everything lit
The hood behind us, nigga everything lit

[Verse 2: Don Q]
I know they're waiting to stop me
Niggas got hate in they're body
Im off an eighth and an oxy
I move that yay in the lobby
I just ran into a blonde jon
She's gon pull up with edible thongs on
Young niggas putting THE BRONX on
Who else you heard Flex drop a bomb on
I make sure everything lit
I make sure everything lit
She's fuckin, suckin when she jumps in the whip
Thirty-hundred and thats just on the fit
Dirty money and it's all off the fish
Thirty minutes we could run through a zip
You bought a Cuban hope it comes with a grip
Wolves out, they be hunting and shit

(Look)

[Verse 3: Don Q]
Fast money just influence niggas
Bad bitches trynna ruin niggas
Fast whips when I'm cruising nigga
Brad Simmons when I'm moving nigga
I pull the sleeve and let the arm breathe
She's gon see the logo on the car keys
Take a trip, west palm trees
Just no bags, just jar weed
Hoop ride with a deep tint
I was laid back and the seat bent
I'm strapped up playing defense
When I went broke, I ain't sleep since
Had the same clothes I ain't eat shit
Had to get work, had to remix
Had to sling O's for them bankrolls
Then my life changed when that piece hit

[Hook/Outro]

I'll make sure everything lit (x4)
Everything, everything, everything lit
My roli shinning, nigga everything lit
My clothes designer, nigga everything lit
The hood behind us, nigga everything lit
