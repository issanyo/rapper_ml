[Chorus]
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, I'm fuckin' your girl
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, she came on to me

[Daz Dillinger]
While you mad I ain't got nothin' to be mad about
I'm in my house with my balls up on yo' couch
With the remote in hand, dick in the other
Waitin' on yo' bitch to bring me a rubber
In and out, out and in
It was us to begin then was just her and her friends
Gettin' busy for B-A and Diggy, we hit the city
Me and Kurupt, Bad Azz - Dogg Pound committee (yeah)
(Question) You see how your girl act around me?
(Question) Look at your phone bill, see how she on me?
(Question) When she around she stop holdin' your hand
(Question) She's my bitch and you her man
Awareness, me and you - yeah we can share this
I don't fuck bareness, nigga that's careless
Don't hate me, hate the bitch, congratulate this
Had sex when we back in the mix

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, I'm fuckin' your girl
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, she came on to me

[Bad Azz]
Me, I'm always checkin' game with my psycho factions
Bitch, I'm Super Bad like I'm Michael Jackson
Playa, while you sleepin' I'm creepin' all in your world
In your house on your couch dippin' all in your girl
We ain't always at your house, one time I took her out
We drove around town with my dick in her mouth
Your love is my fun, yeah I'm fuckin' your girl
I'ma thug, she the one, I'm just fuckin' your girl
It's nothin' to a boss so don't be mad at all
She a freak, you know the way she reach and grab some balls
Right before they wind up stuck in the jaws
Yeah that's the way that she always get at me
You always outta town so she always get at me
She seen me with Daz, made some passes at me
She love this Bad dick so she always attack me
We fucked on the floor, she ate my dick like a Lunchable
You need a bigger bed that's more fuckable

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, I'm fuckin' your girl
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, she came on to me

[Kurupt]
It - ain't - my - thang
It ain't my club, it ain't my car
I didn't buy the rubbers, I didn't pick her up
But I'ma dick her up and get my dick and stick it up
Get your bitch together, hold that bitch
Before I get young Gail to fold that bitch
Gotstra, all the hoes want a piece of him
It's only the ones he dicks and then releases 'em
See your bitch is a super freak
I fucked yo' bitch last week - D.P.G
You know we smash the streets
Dippin' in the 'Llac bangin' classic beats
See I don't give a fuck - who you talkin' to
I got one for her and one for you
Nigga see I don't know what the fuck you wanna do
If it can happen to me, it could happen to you
But it ain't, but it ain't

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, I'm fuckin' your girl
It ain't my fault, I'm fuckin' your girl
Can't you seeeeee, she came on to me
