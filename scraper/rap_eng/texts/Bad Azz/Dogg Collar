[Chorus x2]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yeah (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar! (With Diamonds on it baby)

[Snoop Dogg x2]
It's not a problem That I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix

[Verse One: Snoop Dogg]
So Mystical, Magical
It's not a lamp, it's a collar
And it's gauranteed to get you dollars
Make 'em wanna holla in this hole like an impala
It's Snoop Dogg and you know i'm top dolla
Groovin', and Movin', Provin' once again
Coming on through, cause Yes I gots to win
I can't lose, I booze and cruise
Keep it all in the ooze
And leave 'em all confused
They losers like that

[Verse Two: Bad Azz]
Life is hard as a brick or turn
Through the stress, and the struggle
But you gotta be strong
Have muscle, hustle, hard as you can I am
Cause I be damned if I'm broke, starving, living outta can
Man I live my life like Puff-a-little
Get right through
My mind focused on my money
So my shit's tight
Best believe that's right
And if I'm wrong, then the beach that I'm from ain't row
But it's strong, and you can see
Even if you ain't starin'
You weak, You can't rap, There ain't no comparin'
East Side's Greatest outlaws
No flaws, No slips, Pump your breaks, Hit the Disc
Get the chips, Yeah
The new hundred look funny
But this paper ain't no dope
It'll still get you smoked
It's the dope
That a make a nigga weak and fall asleep
And can't cope with life on the streets

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
And that's for real
So bow down to the Bow wow cause he coming back with a new style
And it'll make you holla
The top dollar
And all you need is your dog collar

[Chorus x2]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yeah (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar! (With Diamonds on it baby)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Now, I see what you see
But you probably don't believe
What I believe, You got a trick up your sleeve
Ain't too much, just to hot to rush
Sit back, relax, and let me go ahead and buzz it up
Imma get into it, Cuz you know I can
And imma hit with you the hellified masterplan
Intelligence, Elegance
And what you wear is irrelevant
So please, don't feel hesistant
Cause you know the dogg collar is president, in his resident
And the message is
No money, drink, no weed, all you need
Is this prestige, collar
That'll make ya grandma wanna holla
Diamonds in the bank, like an impala
And I wouldn't trade mine for a million dollars

[Chorus x2]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yeah (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar! (With Diamonds on it baby)

[Snoop Dogg x2]
It's not a problem That I can't fix
Cause I can do in the mix

[Outro x2]
Everyone will see
That you're down with me
We'll have lots of fun together
You just wait and see
All you need in your dogg collar! (With Diamonds on it baby)

How we doin' this

It's the doggy style
How we doin' this
