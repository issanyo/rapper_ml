[Verse 1]
Fuck life, fuck feelings, smoke propane
Pussy fuck at the crib, I can't feel pain
Black heart, black lungs, black boot stain
There's a snake in my boot, I can't feel, aye
Gnaw flesh, yeah, like my pussy's wet, yeah
Grip right with the TEC, yeah
You might need a vest, aye
FTP my chest, yeah
She seen my arrest, yeah
She think that I'm viral, yeah

[Interlude]
This bitch would like to have sex

[Verse 2]
Ayeee
Pull up on the block, aye, yuh (What's that?)
Lil bitch this a Glock, aye, yuh
Stop that, my eyes look like raw egg, aye, yuh
Get it up, heard you shop at Ralph’s, aye, yuh, what’s that?
