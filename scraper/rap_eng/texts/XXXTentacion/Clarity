[Verse]
Sever her bonds, you take the wheel, I lost control, ayy
She did it all for some clarification that you never know, ayy
Give it a rest, best, chest it off of the what these sacrifice of us
Clarity so where is the fairer few
Will never be free of this
So I pay the fucker repent
Trifle for the foolish will not give me bank
I fucked the face of the few I resent
I flee the life without doubt in my head

[Hook]
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If i am alone she is my God
