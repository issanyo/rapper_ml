[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
My boy's being sus
He was just shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends
Like I love my split ends
And by that I mean
He cuts 'em off
(What?!)

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & XXXTENTACION]
Boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like you promised (yeah)
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Ooh, she's screaming in my head
Ooh, I left her where I slept
Somewhere, I can't escape
I'm running from myself (ooh)
Somewhere in between in love and broken
I'm in hell

[Outro]
My boy (my boy)
