[Verse]
And hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers
Tie your throat to a truck bed and pedal the metal quickly
