[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Hear, regret
Say the words

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Don't cry, don't cry, it won't end
Pain will always be my friend
Don't cry, don't cry
Pain will always be my friend
