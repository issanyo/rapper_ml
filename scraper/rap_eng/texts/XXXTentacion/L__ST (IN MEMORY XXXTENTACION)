Sometimes I be talking when I’m asleep
Ay
I can hear your voice it keeps telling me chase your dreams
Ay
Fuck all you haters just let my homie Rest In Peace
Ay
Been through the highs seen the lows never defeated
No you can defeat him
Remember that time
We was making hits
We were in the studio
You told me play my shit
You took it world wide
Taking over the nation
Spreading all this love with some motivation

You lift my spirits up when the times were getting rough
I was down and out
But you were there to pick me up
Always kept it real
There was no time I ever doubted
Called me out on stage
My lil bruh kept it a thousand
Yea yea

Oh ohh
My homie killed the show
You live forever
Your spirit's here forever
I know you're here with us
And we will never forget ya

[Hook: Rio Santana]

Tell me where to go
Tell me where to go

Know it no more, no
So tell me where to go (tell me where to go)
Tell me where to go
Cus I don’t know it no more (I don't know)
Know it no more (I don't know)
Know it no more (I don't know)
