[Verse]
Star fall, fear calls waiting on you, I’d never run
Kiss, fuck, I won’t feel I doubt that I would ever want
Hold me, kiss me, fuck me, you don’t wanna love
Haunt me, hang me, love me, I don’t ever love

[Hook]
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
Ooh, there’s an elephant in this room
