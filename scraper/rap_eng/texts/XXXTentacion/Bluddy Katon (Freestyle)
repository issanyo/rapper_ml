[Intro]
Turn it up a little, a little more
That's good
Cocaine

[Bridge]
Bands on my neck, hunnid bands on my neck
Pull up on a young bitch with the muthafuckin' Tec
I got bands on my neck, hunnid bands on my neck
Pull up in a nigga's city with the Tec to his chest
Young nigga comin' through with the bands
I got hunnids on me, homie, I got hunnid fuckin' bands
Pull up on a nigga, bitch I look like Charlie Brown
Coolest young nigga, rollin' through a nigga town

[Verse 1]
Hunnids on my dick, hunnids on my neck
See a pussy nigga, gets drummin' with a Tec
Pull up on yo ma's, drop a bomb on her pussy
Young nigga, I don't like relations
Fuck that lovin' mushy bullshit
With the clip, with the shits, I'm off the shits
Take your bitch I'm with the shit
Ride around with a full ass clip
Pull up on a nigga, then I shoot a nigga
Pussy nigga in a baseball bat, throw'd up a nigga --
(*Laughing* ay, ay)

[Verse 2]
Blood on my katana, I'm comin' for yo mama
Slit her fuckin' throat, I ain't with the fuckin' drama
Blood between my nails, never fuckin' go to Yale
But I likely go to jail, just for readin' fuckin' brail
Niggas don't ever prosper, niggas don't never change
Niggas can't pull up in a nice fuckin' Range
Drama on my mind, hunnid commas on my mind
Dirty bitch, all she want is a nigga time
Blood on my katana, I'm comin' for yo mama
'Live from the grave, pussy nigga count commas
'Live for my niggas, all my niggas countin' mamas
My humble mama see the bitch she with the drama
Take it to the grave, bury her today
All my niggas with it like a muthafuckin' skirmish
I was ridin' through the hood with the hoodie, uh
Ion look like Trayvon, bust like-
