[Intro]
Yuh
Oh my god, Ronny!

[Chorus]
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a pornstar, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, eh, eh, eh, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a pornstar, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, eh, eh, eh, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight B?

[Verse]
Treat that pussy just like ping pong
Back and forth just like I'm King Kong
At your city nigga, ding dong
At your phone just like a, mm, uh
At your front door like Jehovah's Witness
I'm too kind so I'ma spare the witness
Fresher than a nigga with a retweet
Dreads is real as fuck they not extensions
Count up my feta, yuh
Treat on margiela, yuh
Like Finding Nemo I hope you go belly up
Never mind, kill 'em with kindness
Call me your highness, heard you a friend, gotta sign up
These niggas slow like some tortoises, hm
I got machine gun like, what you say?, hm
Bitch, I am real like The Walking Dead, uh
Dude fuck around, leave you Walking Dead, hm

[Chorus]
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a pornstar, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, eh, eh, eh, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a pornstar, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, eh, eh, eh, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight B?
