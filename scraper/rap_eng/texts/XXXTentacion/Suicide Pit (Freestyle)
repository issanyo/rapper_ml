[Intro]
Aye, haha, yuh
Bad Vibes Forever
Wrist, wrist, work, uh
Ah, fuck
Wrist work, uh
Yuh, aye, yuh, aye, aye, yuh, aye, aye, aye
Look at me

[Verse]
Face plant, face plant, face plant, yuh
I need love, I need drugs, I need savior
All my niggas, I got blood on my hands, yuh
I might up the heater, tryna hold my fuckin' bands, aye, yuh
Fuck out my way, Johnny Cage face kick
I might lose my mind, I can't ever love a bitch
Face that dope, fuck a vote, fuck Trump
When that nigga win, put his body in the trunk
I eat the flesh off an enemy, aye, yuh
Liver lookin' oh so fuckin' good to me, yuh, aye
Menace is the only fuckin' friend of me, aye, yuh
Fuck that shit, I need Hennessy, yuh, aye
Wave lookin' like mass genocide, aye, yuh
World War X, I got men in line, aye, yuh
Fuck my life, I don't wanna love
Death before dishonor I am not a pig

[Chorus]
Suicide pit, suicide pit, suicide pit, suicide pit
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up
Suicide pit, suicide pit, suicide pit, suicide pit
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
