[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
And if the world ever has an apocalypse
I will kill all of you fuckers
Fear will be plentiful, death will be bountiful
I will spare none of you peasants
Fuck your religion, your pastor fucked kids
And got sent to a prison in PC
I seen the devil, he’s in you and me
You need saving to listen to this, see
Follow 'em home, cut the right corner so nobody sees you
Turn off your phone
Leave it at home so nobody can trace you
Mask your expressions
Appear to be calm, they won't read your intentions
As soon as you’re in
Let them all know who they’re all in the presence of
I am a murderer
I am a demon, the son of a serpent
What is your faith?
What is your worth?
Have you felt acknowledgment?
If I kill you now, will you go to heaven or hell you believe in?
Death is approaching you
30 seconds to think before lying in a blood sea

And if the world ever has an apocalypse
I will kill all of you fuckers
Fear will be plentiful, death will be bountiful
