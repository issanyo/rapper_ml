[Intro: Dylan Jordan]
How will I learn to love again?
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?
No, I don't wanna get hurt again
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?

[Verse 1: Dylan Jordan]
Ease, baby
Wear my heart up on my sleeve, baby
Please, baby
Give me a reason to believe maybe
Keep sayin'
Everything that all your friends said
She's shady
I don't think you really meant it
I don't think you really meant it
I've been on my own mind
I've been really stressing
Girl, you know you never meant it
I've been on my own time
I forgot to mention

[Chorus: Dylan Jordan & Souly Had]
How will I learn to love again?
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?
No, I don't wanna get hurt again
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?

[Verse 2: Souly Had]
Breathe, baby
I thought I had what you need, baby
Replay me
I know I was what you need, baby
Seems crazy
Yeah, but all things fall apart
And now the leaves changing
Pretty soon you gon' be gone
I'm yellin' freeze, baby
Stop right there
You a thousand light years away
Might need a flight there
Now I'm overseas, baby
But I'm right here
When you need me, say the word
You know I'll be right there, right there

[Chorus: Dylan Jordan & Souly Had]
How will I learn to love again?
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?
No, I don't wanna get hurt again
Yeah, how will I learn to love again?

[Outro]
(How will I learn to love again?
I don't wanna get hurt again
How will I learn to love again?
How will I learn to love again?)
