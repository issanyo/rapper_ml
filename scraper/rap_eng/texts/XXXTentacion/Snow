[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
You'll see
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I canâ€™t feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores who want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough but
It's time
Body falls so I don't know, who to call at all
And my heart can't take on my broken soul
I'm so fucking numb, my life has succumbed
To hate treating death alone
In the snow
