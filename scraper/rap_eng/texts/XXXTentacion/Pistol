[Intro]
Still a Very Rare young nigga
Still a Slaughterhill nigga
Still a Sunrise nigga
Still a Deepside nigga
I think it’s bout that time
'Bout that time we tell these niggas
I’ve been a nobody
I’ve been a member of the Fall
Let’s go, y’all
Aye

[Verse 1]
I am the lyrical veteran
War-struck adrenaline
Pussy boy who you is better than
Grippin that pistol grip
Yo' bitch is submissin' so I make her pistol grip
Murder and kill her jits
I strike the fucker refusin' to give a shit
Cock in her mouth to show you what I’m bout
Yes I fucked her then made that bitch shoot her kids
Three heads like cerberus, geeked off adrenaline
Feelin like Shaq, I’m a dunk on the pig
He dirty like derby, she suck me like kirby
I murder the fucker then eat on her clit
I fantisize 'bout a Japanese bitch
She fantasize about sucking my dick
She wanna be famous, for shaking her anus
I told her to Kim K and fuck on the flick

[Hook]
I got the pistol grip
I’m down to pistol whip
Yes, I got the pistol
Yes, I got the pistol bitch
I’m down to pistol whip
Yes, I got the pistol
Yes, I got the pistol grip
Yes, I’m down to pistol whip
I got the pistol
Yes I got the pistol, bitch
I’m down to pistol whip
Yes I got the pistol
Yes I got the pistol bitch
I’m down to pistol grip
Yes I got the pistol
Yes I got the pistol grip
I’m down to pistol grip
Yes I got the pistol
Yes tommy the pistol grip
Yes I’m down to pistol whip

Yes I’m down to pistol grip
