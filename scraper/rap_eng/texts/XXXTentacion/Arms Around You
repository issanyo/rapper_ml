[Intro: Rio Santana]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rio Santana]
I see the sun rise when you wake up
You're beautiful with no make-up
I wonder if you were dreaming
Makin' love when I'm sleeping
I see you wearing my T-shirt
You turn me on, you a big flirt
Sunday morning, no spending day
No work for the weekend

[Pre-Chorus: Rio Santana]
I'ma say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-woah, oh oh
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
I'ma say
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh oh
Arms around you, girl
Let me love you, girl

[Chorus: Rio Santana]
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Arms around you
Te amo, mami, let me hold you
Got me arms right around you, girl, ooyy
Good lovin', got all around you
To make sure no one could harm you
Dale, mami, let me have you, ooyy

[Pre-Chorus: Rio Santana]
I'ma say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-woah, oh oh
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
I'ma say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-woah, oh oh
Arms around you, girl
Let me love you, girl

[Chorus: Rio Santana]
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl

[Bridge: Rio Santana]
I want it, I want it, bad
I want it, I want it, bad
I want it, I want it, bad
I want it, I want it, bad

[Chorus: Rio Santana]
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you
Arms around you
Arms around you, girl
Arms around you, girl
