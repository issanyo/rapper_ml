[Verse]
I regained the breathe of the last man
I'm so relaxed soon we are the blessed one
I will recollect the body manifest
And puff a cigarette, six sicker
Body flip 'em wrists, who could give a shit
If mama showed how the fuck it's done
Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready

[Sample]
And out of the darkness the zombie did call
True pain and suffering
He brought to them all

[Hook]
Bullets like confetti
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same love?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slipknot
Then we hang
Pretty pushy broad
Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch

[Break]

Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch
