[Intro: KiD TRUNKS]
Yuh, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm off the acid, oh no
Cris Dinero on the track
Haha, haha, haha, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Bitch, I came to kill, on my momma
Pussy boy talk 'til I hit him with a llama
That bitch don't understand
When she just don't want no drama
That baby mama, drama
I don't wanna talk about it
Bitch I came to kill, on my momma
Pussy boy talk 'til I hit him with a llama
That bitch don't understand
When she just don't want no drama
That baby mama, drama
I don't wanna talk about it

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Well hello there
Ayy, crack on me, crack on, crack on me like Lamar Odom
Head bust, fucking head bust your head open
She gon' bust her legs wide open, pussy broken, uh
On yo' block, all up on yo' block, I’m sittin', smokin', ayy uh
Wait, uh, huh, ayy, my dick in my Glock, ayy
My blade don’t like cops, ayy
What's that? What's that? Red dot (bop, bop, bop, BOP!)
Grrra! Gratata, ayy
Shoot at pussy bwoys
Can't fuck with pussy bwoys
Put a pistol on pussy bwoys

[Interlude]
In Jesus' name—

[Outro: Craig Xen]
Bitch, I came to kill
You and yo' momma
Boo-boo-boo-boo
Yo' medulla oblongata
Blood drippin', it spill
Look like salsa
Cock back it up, yeah
That back poppin' piñata
