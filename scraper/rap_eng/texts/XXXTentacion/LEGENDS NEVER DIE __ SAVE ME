[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
Let's say worse thing comes to worst... I fucking die a tragic death or some shit and I at least want to know that the kids perceived my message and were able to make something of themselves and able to take my message and use it and turn it into something positive and to at least have a good live. If I'm gonna die or ever be a sacrifice I want to make sure that my life made at least 5 million kids happy...

[Chorus]
Hello, from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? (my friend)
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon' end?
Voices in my head
Telling me I'm gonna end up dead

[Interlude: XXXTENTACION]
Or they found some sort of answers are resolve in my life regardless of the negative around my name, regardless of of the bad things people say to me I don't give a fuck, because I know my goal in the end and I know what I want for everyone and I know what my message is...

[Chorus]
Hello, from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? (my friend)
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon' end?
Voices in my head
Telling me I'm gonna end up dead
So save me (save me), before I fall

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
So I just wanted to say I appreciate and love all of you and I believe in you all do not let your depression make you
