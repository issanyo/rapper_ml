[Verse 1]
There she was, with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replaced kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learned to be passive, but such is a loss
Accepting defeat without foreclosing costs
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim and I'll play insane

[Hook]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

[Verse 2]
Stomp out that fucker, his death will be slow
You made me do this, just as far as you know
If you don't exist, then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig

[Hook]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

[Outro]
I am the heart marksman
