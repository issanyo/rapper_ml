[Verse]
I just wanna wet my wrist, mad that I done fucked yo bitch
For right now bitch I'm over it, I'm over all that faggot shit
Hidding true potential for so long like cmon kid
I'm fucking sick, this year I promise I'm dropping my illest shit
I said fuck it, I'll get duffets
Can't trust shit, bitch I'll just tuck it captin all up in my stomach
I've done it, so quick I run it
There ain't no love in this
But I do it for my clique
All you bitches fucking live, I did not mean to exist
Bitch I'm pissed at the fact of this
Fuck my whole life, crack in half I guess
I do my best I get along like yes
But I just do what is said
But I just do what is said
But I just do what is said
So all you hoes can suck my dick
Cause bitch I'm back up on my shit
Killstreak, kamikaze it
Popped that bitch pussy like zit
That hoe ask me for some sex
Put my dick bewtween her breats
All you fuckers be upset
Krimsxn coming tripple threat
Pull up wit shit i double bitch
Got a blade it be a switch
Crash that whip striaght in the ditch
Voice raspy just like that stitch

[Hook]
Oh wait hoe
You need to wait hoe
Put me in a cape and I still won't fucking
Save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe
Wait hoe, snake hoe, wait hoe, yuh
Put me in a cape and I still won't fucking
Save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe
