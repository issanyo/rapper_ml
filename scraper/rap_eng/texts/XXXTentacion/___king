[Verse: Charlie Cleasby]
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won’t be upset if
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
Not in love, I won’t let you control what, what I want

[Chorus: Charlie Cleasby]
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love

[Bridge: Connor Edwards]
Hey, you, hey, you, you, what, hey, you
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Hey, you, you, no, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you)

[Chorus: Charlie Cleasby]
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I’m killing everyone I love
