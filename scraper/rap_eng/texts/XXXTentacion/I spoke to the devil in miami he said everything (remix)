[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
Clears throat
It will all be over soon
Sniffling

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
And I’m always where the
Sun don’t shine, the
Tears don’t show, won't
Hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I
Hate myself, but
It won't show, I
Constantly lose all
My remorse and it's
Ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd
And it's
One for the sheep who
Led by the leopard, often
Gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze
Couldn’t control the pace
Where is this going? Hey
Heartless is recklessness, it's
War with the pacifist to
Word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, My Lord, I
Spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I
Gave you one thing you needed
What is this thing I pleaded?
Boy, it's the key to even
Yeah

[Interlude: XXXTENTACION]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
Anima vestra
Anima
Anima vestra
Anima

[Verse 2: PRXJEK]
Everyday there's
Conflict with myself it just
Leads to negative thoughts, it's like my
Heart is on a shelf, from all the
Deception I've been facing, I'm just
Mentally scarred
They don't see what's underneath, but I'm
Fighting demons, you see this smile frequent, cause I'm
Scared of how they'll look at me
It's like I'm a character in a book and the
Ending is dark
So I put on music and let it play through my ears
And here I'm pretending it's alright
But at night time is when I'm thinking of ending it all
My heart has been severed
The weapon is sharp
As every sentence that I pen on the crevice of this paper
Slowly rips my temple apart
But these tears won't show
And where are you when I need you the most?
Lord knows I don't deserve you, but I
Been up for days, wondering if you regret it
The day we met, or did you forget it?
Succumbing to feeling empty
This loneliness so upsetting
It's cold and it's so depressing
See the thing is, I won't accept it
I know that you've been neglected
It shows in the way you left me
But I know for a fact you felt it
I feel so alone and helpless
Atonement for being selfish
Wrote this poem, although, seldom
Normally by myself and
Enclosed behind doors, yelling
Yeah

[Outro: PRXJEK]
These words will release my soul
I'm feeling this evil grow
I wish they'd leave me alone
I don't wanna see her go
Yeah, sniffling
I don't wanna see her go
