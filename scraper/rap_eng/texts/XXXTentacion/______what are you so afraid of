What are you so afraid of?
Is it love or wasting your time?
What are you so afraid of?
Is it love or wasting your time?

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

What are you so afraid of?
Is it love or wasting your time?
What are you so afraid of?
Is it love or wasting your time?

[Post-Chorus]
