[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can’t pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I’ll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I’ll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I’ll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I’ll rot
