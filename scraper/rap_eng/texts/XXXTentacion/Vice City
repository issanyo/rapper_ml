[Intro: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you, looking for a brighter season (yeah)
Need to lay your burden down (haha)
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (Dutty, young blood sucka')
Buried under deeper ground (uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

[Chorus: Laura Mvula (Reversed) & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you (Uh, give me a sec, look)
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you (Okay, okay)
When the lights go out and you're on your own

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everybody is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

[Chorus: Laura Mvula (reversed) & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
My hypothesis is, death ain't shit
Hey there you
I'd rather die than be alive in this life
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Honestly full of trife and strife
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Jah

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Through the sky
Through-through the sky

[Hook: Laura Mvula (reversed)]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Through the sky
Through-through the sky
