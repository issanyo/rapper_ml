[Verse]
The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at all
