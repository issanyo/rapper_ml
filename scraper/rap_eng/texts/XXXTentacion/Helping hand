[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
Today, I'm going to be going to a foster home, and I'm going to be donating a bunch of clothes, a bunch of PS4s, like shoes, and different things to the kids
I'm gonna donate like a bunch of stuff to them, so uh, I was just gonna record it cause I never record any of the good things I do, and um, not only that I really wanted to not only set some sort of positive energy in the air, but also to influence other people to do it as well
I was actually gonna start a movement, called "The Helping Hand", uh where you guys like record um, you doing good things for people, and kind of spread that positive energy

[Chorus: Ionika]
I'm feeling lonely, so lonely
I'm missing your voice, it's gone, can't breathe
I've been feeling-
I know you're up there watching
I miss you, it's hard to say it's real
I've been crying

[Verse 1]
It's so hard, to see another legend get shot
It's not right, all he wanted was to save us
To help us believe that depression wasn't pain, that it was just the rain outside, that it wasn't that suicide
That inspired this song, he's gone, it's wrong, and I can't fathom this shit another lost cause!

[Verse 2]
Fucked up, isn't it? How one person tries to change the world, now he can't do it
First 2Pac, Biggie, then Chester, now X, no one thought for a second that he'd end up like the rest
He had a helping hand, fed all the kids who didn't have fam or a dad or felt sad
Didn't just feed them food, he fed them happiness and joy that sounds like Jahseh Onfroy

[Bridge]
Pain, I've been feeling pain just to hold on
I haven't felt the same, you're gone...
Pain, I've been feeling pain just to move on
I haven't felt the same, you're gone...

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well, so well (Rest in peace X)
I mean I can do anything he can
I've been pretty-

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
I'm just gonna be vlogging today, in hopes that it'll make some people feel good, and I just really like doing good things for people, this is my first time ever doing this, never do this, but I hope you enjoy
