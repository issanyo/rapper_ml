[Chorus]
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice

[Bridge]
Ooh, you're poison
Poison, filled with poison
Fill my veins with poison
Poison, filled with poison

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
