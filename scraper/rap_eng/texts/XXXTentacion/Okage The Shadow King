[Intro]
They say "X is just a city bitch," ya feel me
But it's not even gon' be that bad
I just been chillin', bruh
So
(MURK!)

[Verse]
Rap rigorous
Ace the plate, killin' shit
Pace is great, villainous
Filling the plate, pissing all over your pussy pedestal
So skeptical, little edibles, spread 'em, then I'ma wet 'em
Forget 'em, I'll never let 'em, regret 'em
No scope, they scatter, coke flow like batter
Blood drain like batteries, all you niggas is calories
Get burned, this finger, your bitch squirm
I'm rigorous, just learn, you niggas should take turns
I pop that pussy like an Adderall
Niggas will act as if they powerful, but got they backs against the wall
I never could figure my niggas, get bigger, my nigga, and pass the stretcher
Part of the reason I focus on livin' this second and pass the pressure
Mister, Mister, addict ya, coke slang, like
This is like Mike Vick, I'm vicious and misfit
Don't fit like fitness
So fit, but ya shit get dissed, on fleek shit, my wrists on slit, bitch
My dick, my dick wet
Shit like ass-crack
Piss might split quick, but slow to fight back
Niggas in Chiraq, shootin' like Iraq
Death to Jah's soldiers, bust your kneecaps
I came to murder you niggas, no need to fight back
No need to fight back
No need to fight back, yeah
Turn me off, yeah
