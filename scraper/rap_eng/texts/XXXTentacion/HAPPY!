[Intro: Aries & XXXTENTACION]
I'll wait for you (Yeah)
I'll wait for you

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave
