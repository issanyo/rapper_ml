[Chorus: Ronny J]
I stay banded up, I stay banded up

[Verse 1: Ronny J]
Bitch, I'm too expensive
Choppas too extensive
Please don't get too close, I go Gucci Ghost
I'm in Louis, ho, I'm in Louis, ho
I'm too rich to kids, I'm like Rich The Kid
Throw them bitches lips
Got them titties lifted
I'm just lit, I'm lifted
Had to tip my babe off
Had to get my waiver
I don't even need a Rollie, but I bought the Rollie
I don't even need a Jeep, but I bought the Jeep
I don't even want the top, I just wanna sleep
Yeah, I got too many eyes on me
I got two bitches and they got they thighs on me
I just broke my baby's heart so she cries on me
I just got a little ticket so she flies for free (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ronny J and XXXTENTACION]
I stay banded up, I stay banded up
I stay banded up, I stay banded up
I get many fucks, she get plenty fucks

I get many fucks, she get plenty fucks (yuh)
I don't wanna fuck (yuh), keep your panties up (yuh, uh)

She got lockjaw, I put my dick all in her face, ha, ha
Her pussy hurt, might need a Band-Aid, I'm pussy bandit, yuh, yuh
Don't kill my vibe, lil' bitch, why are you tripping?
