[Monologue: XXXTENTACION]
To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy.
