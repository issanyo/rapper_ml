[Lyrics from snippet]

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION & Craig Xen]
... the back, uh
Black tint, black cars posted in the back, uh
4 o' clock, loaded Glock, I can’t never lack, uh
Use a club, if you hit a lick can’t run it back, uh
Okay shorty, I can’t trust no bitch, how you do that? Uh
Fuck the fame, I'ma kill a bitch if he talk wack, uh
I'ma wreck his shit, don't sweat this shit, aye, run it back
If I'm in yo' hood and see you, bitch, aye, run it back (Woo!)
Pistols have him running like a fucking running back

[Verse 2: Craig Xen]
Aye, run it back, run it, run it back (Where he at?)
Thought that heat was cold, thump him on the face (One said)
One step, aye, kill that fuck nigga for his salary
Pussy tryna cap, sing his motherfucking stats
Ain't shit changed but the ring on my hand
I'm a fucking fiend, know I bleed, okay
Heard him sneak dissin' on my team, not gon' lie
Hit him for the diss, snatch that bling, okay

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
Fool me, you try me you’ll lose ya hopscotch, huh
My OG told me, "Don't trust thots or fuckboys", uh (Ay-ay)
Bloody knife in my holster, I behead dykes, uh (Ayy!)
Cut a opp, not no fucking mom want dead guys
I don't sleep, I rest with my knife at bedtime (Aye! Aye! Aye!)
