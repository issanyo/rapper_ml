Why do I feel so alone
Like everyone seems to be out to get me
Feeling like everyone's the same
But Then I guess that makes me crazy
Screaming RIP Nicole
And RIP them all
And RIP my angel
Wish that she was coming home
Talking about how
There would be plenty of grapes on the grapevine
I feel devastated and agitated
At the same time
No ceilings, I aim high
No feelings, they ain't mine
No minutes, there ain't time
Danger, no sign
Tell me
How am I suppose to live
If you ain't living, bae
How am I suppose to change
If not forgiven, bae
Know you watching me from above
I hate for you to see
The heartaches
Someone put me out of my misery
When younger tell me love was in the air
Lately I just never care
All the wounds that caving in
And I hit myself again
And although my plan don't work
Got my feet up in the dirt
But I'm pushing in my words
And I need you now

Better hold on
Baby, you're strong
You're a soldier

Say that things change
All around you
Getting older

And until like we work for us
Stay by my side
When you're high alot

I know how hard it all can be

[xxxtentacion]
Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh
