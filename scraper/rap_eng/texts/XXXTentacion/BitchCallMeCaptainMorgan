[Intro]
Yeah
Shut up!

[Verse]
Tempo changed, trapped in the rain
Slide on my sidekick rusts anyway
I been feeling lost in the dirt, I stray
Running from the man with the blade, I say
Look in the mirror doesn't feel any better
Magazine covers see my mama had better
Treatments cease and it don't fuckin' matter
Big foot, big foot stomped in bones shatter
Feeling like Vader, wrist dimensions
Skinny white bitches always geeked in my mentions
Put your fucking mouth on the curb, shove him in it
Bitch tryna have me suicidal, Sean Kingston
NASCAR cap put a strap to his back
Brass knuckles on my hand so I can't call back
Feeling like ming billionaire boy brand
Fuck a gun, grab a blade and your throat cut back

[Outro]
Captain Morgan, bitch I'm, gorgeous
Fish scale, bitch I got bail
Captain Morgan, bitch I'm, gorgeous
Fish scale, bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
Bitch I got bail, yuh
Bitch I got bail
Yeah, okay, o-
