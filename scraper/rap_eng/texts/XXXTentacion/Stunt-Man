[Intro]
2 Phone do his own stunt
2 Phone do his own stunt
Phone nigga do my own stunts

[Verse 1]
Ay, Sailor Moon we spooned under the lunar
Rick Owens space suit let her swoon in my Pluto wrist
Paint her face, Basquiat in her uterus
Agent slade hall of fame, I paid two hundred
Codeine Castle, red women like Stanis
Bling bling mad king you know I do magic
Stick to the code my hand go Jaime Lannister
Know that you want it same nigga from Calenders
But

[Bridge]
Tennis bracelet my left hand
Cuban Link, right hand
That mean I dictate with my right, and my left touch racks
I rubber band all that, rub 'em out I'm a stunt man
Fuckin' no rubber off that, got a rubber band bottom on fake Raf

[Chorus]
I stunt on a bitch shawty, I'm kickin' these new drills
Look at my chain shawty, look at my bracelet
I kick too much flav' shawty, might get you a new wrist
You know I'm a stunt man, I make you do flips

[Verse 2]
You can get back with that bullshit
You can get whacked, boy we can shoot shit
All yo' ass do is flag you should turn Crip
I might come out the blue, turn your shirt red
I might chop my weight up on my new flex, Pidgeot I'm evolved on my bird shit
Pokemon, I might go to a new gym
Pokestop my car top got a new egg
Kobe with it, but I keep me a Piston
She sucked on my dick and the sim' nigga kissed her
No Tia & Tamera, I keep me a sister
Rodger in your window and I come and hit ya'
Double S boy you know the militia, if you fuck around hang you up like a picture
She sucked on my dick while you text her you miss her
I get in at LIV, in the VIP with my pistol

[Outro]
Stunt on 'em (x16)
