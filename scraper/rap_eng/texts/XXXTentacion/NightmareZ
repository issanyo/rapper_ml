[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
Before the fall there is no justice
No clarity in action
(How dare he?)
Save us all
(I'm in the river)
(A touch of company)
(It was around love)
Woah-oh
Woah-oh

[Verse: Nyora Spouse]
Black on and it’s night time
Don’t dream cause you might find me
In the cut, with some knives on me
Guns strapped and your wife hold me
Been doing drugs for so long
Hit you bitch then hit the bong
Just recording making songs
Turn around and feelin’ wrong
It’s an all black attack
As I pull up in the lack
With some hoes on my lap
And they smokin’ on that dank
Pop us some xannies
I’m plotting for Grammy’s
You plotting to fail, then I come for the win
I left that bitch Tammy
For that bitch Sandy
Both of them angry
At least I win

[Bridge: Nyora Spouse]
My hair growing
The trees rolling
Yo’ bitch chokin’ on dick
My money stackin’
I’m never lackin’
She swallow, never spit

[Chorus: Nyora Spouse]
You have a nightmare, a nightmare
I’m always on your mind
I don’t care, my mind clear
Bitch, I’ll be just fine
You have a nightmare, a nightmare
I’m always on your mind
I don’t care, my mind clear
Bitch, I’ll be just fine
