[Refrain]
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

[Verse]
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

[Chorus]
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al- (right)
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be alright
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al (right)
We gon' be alright, we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-

[Refrain]
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

[Bridge]
She said I, oh, I, am fallin' for you, fallin' for you
I, oh, I, am fallin' for you, fallin' for you
I, oh, I, am fallin' for you, fallin' for you
I, oh, I, am fallin' for you, fallin' for you

[Refrain]
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
