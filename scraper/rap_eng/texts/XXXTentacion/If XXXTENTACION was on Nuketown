[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Round one, fight
Yeah, yeah
The Pharmacy
Uh-uh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Like a tongue, bitch, I'm looking like a lick, uh-uh
Think I'm Thanos, rock diamond my fist, uh-uh
Entertainment with your bitch at night like Nick
Drake and Josh how we team your bitch, uh-uh
Michael Jackson, one glove, I hit, uh-huh
Crying in the club with my stick, uh-huh
Icky Vicky spit, how I got slimes on deck
Metal on me like they just flicked Bic, uh-huh
Two girls, two cups, know I had to level up
Ate a Mario mushroom quick, uh-huh
Know these niggas be chickens like a nugget
They be just actors, Denzel Washington, uh-huh
I'ma play the saddest song on the smallest violin (Haha)
For the niggas in my scrap bin, uh-huh
Maybe we could get along, maybe we could be friends
In another fuckin' life, my friend, uh-huh (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Um, this that
Yes I got the bacon saturated, fuckin' pig fat
I'm not skinny dippin', big drippin', bitch, big facts (Gosh damn)
Uh, Chief Keef that pussy, bang bang
Pretty please don't act like me and you is the fucking same thing
Yes nigga, I switch the flow to unorthodox, gang gang (Ayy, ayy ayy)
They tryna bite like a vampire fang (Gosh damn)
Diamonds water, bendin' like the nigga Aang
Intelligence is only for the gentlemen
So tell the pussy niggas, "Yes, Trix for kids" (Uh-huh)
That's a fact like a Snapple cap tip (Straight up)
Lame niggas sayin' that they fuckin' demons
No wonder that they lost up in the sauce in this bitch
I ain't never need a false deity
Give me power or do a damn thing for me, bitch
When I'm acting like a monster like Stitch
You be acting like a bitch, so I call you sis (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Switcharoo your bitch, uh-huh
This is what I call an assist, uh-huh
Tell 'em this ain't that, and that ain't this
With a flick of my wrist, uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho (I don't give a fuck, bitch)
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho (What? Yeah)

[Verse 3: XXXTentacion]
Fuck did you think? (yeah!)
I was surely fucking runnin' the bank (yeah!)
Cut this crap and take him, one in the brain (fuck!)

Patty cake, patty cake
Work my wrist like patty cake
Two white bitches like Mary-Kate
Nigga want beef like patty cake, aye
That bitch want problems, I'll grab his fuckin' face put that in the dirt (yeah!)
All that fucking talking will get you murked (yeah!)
Run up on me, pussy, you will get murked
I'm coming for your daughter and your life pussy nigga
I'ma make her pussy take pride when I'm in it
Kill a fuck nigga, make em' write what they know (uh-huh!)
Niggas steady barking, but you know they mice for the cheese
Eat my dick like sirloin steak
Rape, bitch, that's my fetish, aye
I don't speak your language, Rosetta, hmm
Only speak the language of a lettuce, hey
Patty cake, patty cake
You finna get some dick today
Drop neck on me like a lynch, bitch, limp dick
Put it on your daughter and she still caught a nut
Patty cake, patty cake
Nutted on your bitch like Johnny K
ATL pull up in roller-skates
Work my tool like a vibrator, aye

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho
