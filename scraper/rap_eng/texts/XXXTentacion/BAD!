Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now
I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah-ahh
Oh

Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now
I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah-ahh
Oh
