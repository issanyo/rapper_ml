[Intro]
You are now listening to your girl's favorite producer, Lowkey Damian

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Fuck on a bitch, make her water water
Super duper super slutty sister
Fuck on the bitch ain't no huggin', no kissin'
Ain't no cussin', bout to beat up your (ahh)
Beat it up, beat it up, Hannibal
Make the pussy the new cancer
Fuck me, suck me, beat it down for daddy
I'ma lick the fatty, I'ma dive in
My wrist fat like my K
When I'm in the pussy, I'm r√°pido
I got the diamonds from Africa
I could pay ya momma car note
I'm on my rebound right now
Slob on my knob like a waterfall
I'll pull up, slaughter your daughter
Keep her mind right like I'm a Tylenol

[Verse 2: Nyora Spouse]
Who ever said that I never flex?
Who ever said that I love my ex?
Who ever said FPS not next?
Niggas telling lies, never making no sense
You gettin' paid in pennies
You only eat at Wendy's
You hate a man you envy
But you can never @ me
I kick my shoes, off
Kick, back
Unzip, the sack
And flip, that
Get, some dabs
And hit, that
Throw, some jabs
Who want, that

[Verse 3: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Catch us smoking like a Newport, choke her
Fuck her out of breath like it's a rally race
I'ma cross her, leave her messy pasta
I'ma (uh) in the pussy, I Rick Ross her
Come on baby, know you drive me crazy
Watch me onomatopoeia on the bitch
Stupid, stupid, bussin' shots like Cupid
I'm a little ruthless, [?] like Uzi
Rocket like Kiss, bitch, you know how I'm rockin'
Ain't Chief Keef but that bang up in my pocket
Sloppy toppy, then I break her pockets
Dance up in that pussy, watch me [?]
