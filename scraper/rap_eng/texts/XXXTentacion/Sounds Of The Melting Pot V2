Ayy, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I
Jump gang that's twelve people no joke
Said have feelings that's my no joke
My coupe with me them stab wounds are no joke
My pack with me don't feel niggas no joke
Uh, eyes locked on my prey
It's follow the leader, you spread and your niggas get sprayed
I'm eyeing your chain, I'm eyein' your chain
(Acid, acid)
What's up with your niggas
They eyeing me L-like they want to get 'em some
*Woman Screams*
Ayy, claws piercing her
