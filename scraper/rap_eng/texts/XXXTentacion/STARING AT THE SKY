[Intro]
Ahem
Yeah

[Chorus]
I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky

[Verse]
Screaming words with no remorse
Pitchforks pointed at my heart
I was staring at the sky

[Bridge]
We're gonna break
We're gonna break
We're gonna break
We're gonna break

[Chorus]
I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
