[Intro]
As a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery

[Verse]
Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin with to get away
But girl, I know you think about it almost every day
And I'll be honest, I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you friendly with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk, too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
This ain't lust, it's love
We had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close
Should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to God, you'd rather cry than call
Don't jump, pretend it don't hurt
Repent, I won't stomp my feet in a rage
My nigga, I'm no chump
Need you and I crave you, hate you
Think I ripped the wings off of my fuckin angel
Don't hurt me, damn

[Outro]
W.R.A.C.
I'll forever be the, I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you
I'm sorry
