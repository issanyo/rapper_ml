[Intro: SZA]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

[Verse 1: SZA]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it...
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I he-hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe-breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming
Just do it
Ye-yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Ye-yeah yeah, feel you moving
Let's do it,  yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

[Verse 2: SZA & XXXTENTACION]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me
Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self-infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me?
Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt
Ice Hotel

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Ice

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Feel the love in the air
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight
Seven virgins
Swerve and converge
Her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten
Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel
