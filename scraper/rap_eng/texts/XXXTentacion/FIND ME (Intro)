[Verse]
Where were you again?
Somewhere with a friend
While I was in my head
I'm lost again, again
She turned around and said
That I was like the rest
That I don't understand the way it is, to her

[Chorus]
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?

[Verse]
Where were you again?
Somewhere with a friend
While I was in my head
I'm lost again, again
She turned around and said
That I was like the rest
That I don't understand the way it is, to her

[Chorus]
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
