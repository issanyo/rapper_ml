[Intro: Carlos Andrez]
Mamita, vente (mamita vente, mamita vente)
Ma-mi-ta (ma-mi-ta)

[Verse 1: Carlos Andrez]
Mamita, vente, olvida la gente
Sé que tu cuerpo me pide calor
Y sé lo que siente', la noche te prende
No te preocupes, me gustan mayor
Girl, you know you got me feeling you the way you move
Baby, bring you closer, let me show you what to do
Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two
Let me have your body, let me show what I can do
Mami, eres tú quien me provoca (-a, -a, -a)
Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca (-a, -a, -a)
Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa (-a, -a, -a)
Enséñame rodillas y abre boca (-a, -a, -a), ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, catch a vibe and pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

[Chorus: Judah]
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight (eh)

[Verse 2: Rio Santana]
Got me caught up in the vibe, now mama let's go
I'ma make you shine in the night time (baby)
Rolling with a star, you could be my angel
Just back that booty up at the right time
I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants
I'm kissing you in advance, baby, live it up
She putting me in a trance, I'm throwing out all my bands
She yelling that this a jam, DJ, turn it up

[Bridge: Rio Santana]
She want it, she want it
We going hard 'til 6 in the morning
She need it, she need it
I bet the neighbors know my name when she moan it

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, catch a vibe and pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

[Chorus: Judah, XXXTENTACION]
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Girl, I'll have you feeling ri-i-i-i-ight
Maybe only for a ni-i-i-i-ight
Come with me and feel the vi-i-i-i-ibe
Know I wanna get insi-i-i-i-ide

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
Hold it now the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down

[Outro: Judah]
By-y-y-y-ye
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
