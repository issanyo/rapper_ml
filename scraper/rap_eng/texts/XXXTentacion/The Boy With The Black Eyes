[Intro]
Natra
Yeah
Prxz
The evolution is near
The brains will start to abandon their religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start

[Verse]
Yeah, I behead a motherfucker for his contacts
Take the body where the others can't see
Seen the devil in my eyes without them contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea
(Grip that motherfucker!)
Yuh, narcissistic crucifixion (Yuh)
Dead weight, I been searching (Ayy)
Niggas coexist, you just don't see them work with other bitches (Yuh)
It's me, black and white, the dark of night
That's when I do my searching (Ayy)
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind
The evolutions lurking, mhm

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my- (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my- (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my- (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head (Aah!)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my- (Aah!), ayy!
