[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Ayy
Brace as you feel the cold like the winter snow
I flew in December defeating my slumber
I'm drowning and you'll never know
Blasted, blasted, want the pressure-pressure
Among the lord, succumb to me under pressure, ayy
Brace
Look at the slits on my wrist
Look at the blood in my piss
Cold as my heart
Tend to get better at this
By the time when I wasn't just
Cold from the start
Grabbin' the K with intentions
You bust it, but niggas be jumpin'
And plus if you add it up, add it up, put it up in your heart
Pussy, might find your heart

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy
Blasted, blasted, ayy
Ayy
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted (Gang)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Gang)
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Gang)
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Gang)
Ayy, ayy
Ayy
Ayy
Blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
With the pressure, pressure
Blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
Bitch I'm blasted, blasted
Want the pressure, pressure

[Outro]
Blasted, blat-
Bitch I'm black ayy, blasted
Black
Bitch I'm black, ayy
Black Gat, ayy
Black, ayy
Black Gat, ayy
Black Mac pack
And the Mac in the back of your backpack
Where the strap? on my lap
Pussy boy-oy, you can get whacked-acked
Ayy, wit' a Tec in your Eyelid
Haha
Pussy boy, pussy boy, ayy
(Very Rare nigga, 2015 nigga, What's good)
Yeah
