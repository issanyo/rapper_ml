[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now

[Verse]
I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah-ahh
Realize she just want me hit it right
'Cause I get 'em goin' right

[Chorus]
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you-

[Drop}
Shawty, heard you
BAD!
Shawty, heard you
Shawty, heard you
BAD!
