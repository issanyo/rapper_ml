I need that neck like Count Drac
Play back so much can't count that

[Hook]
I should’ve let you know, that you’re my only one
I know you're feeling numb, I’ll fuck you till you cum

You want me in your bed, cause I've been in your head

No, no, no

[Verse 3]
You’ve been up all night, so you don’t wanna wait on me
I’m bouta' catch my flight, so you don’t gotta wait on me
No more, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
I’ve been up a very long time, wonder why they hate on me
I don’t wanna love myself, I’m praying that they all love me
Cause you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
