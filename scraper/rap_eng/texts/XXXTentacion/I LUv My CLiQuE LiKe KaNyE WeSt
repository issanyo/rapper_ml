Cudda on the beat

[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
I don't usually be on this trap shit but
Shout out my nigga Vinny Changos, rest in peace Roach
This is the second time I've had to record the fuckin ad-libs
Hey wifi what up vool?
I was just way too loud
So I'ma turn it down just a lil' bit
Yeah, uh, we gon' do this shit the right way
Yeah, alright
Voot up, voot up, ayy, ayy
Voot up, voot up, ayy, yuh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in the trap spot, I need some Hot Spot
I heard the door knock, it's time to sell the block
Jit with the beam, leave blood in my lean
The bitch a molly fiend, she like to fucking tweak
I hit it really far like "where'd it go though"
He fucked a fan, a middleman, and now she don't like me vro
The "We don't fight" shit, how awful, damn, bitch
I keep the tool cause I'm so vool, my nigga real crip, ayy

[Interlude: XXXTENTACION & wifisfuneral]
Hey what did you say you were gonna say?
Come here Wifi, I'm gonna give my dawg the mic real quick
Yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy
Wrist work, wrist work, wrist ayy, wrist, damn, ayy
