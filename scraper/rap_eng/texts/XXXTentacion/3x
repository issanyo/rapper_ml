[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
So what I mean is like, I've seen so much and i'm just...I know what others don't know about me or about this world, at that. And it's being alone. Some things are unexplanable, you know? Some things, I can't sit here and talk about because people disagree or they think that I'm crazy, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
You say that 's your girl but when she's round me she act single, aye
She gon ride my dick so hard it makes her titties jiggle, yuh
Don't get out of line my nigga you might end up missing, aye
I got savage friends and they will whip you with a pistol, oo
