Hook:
I'm just a ticking time bomb
I thrive on the sail destruction
And it's just a matter of time, matter of time Before I
Matter of time, Matter of time before I
Matter of Time Matter of time before I Start ( oh uh )

{ Chorus } Jhene Aiko :
I'm Just ticking time bomb
I thrive on the sail destruction
And its just a matter of time, matter of time before I
Matter of time , matter of time before I
Matter of Time before I start ( oh uh )
