[Intro: $ki Mask The Slump God & XXXTENTACION]
Haha
Aye Ski, they not expectin' this one
You Will Regret, aye like, huh, YOLO
Anything is, possible
Hennything is possible
Been told you, my bitch look like Kim Possible

[Chorus: $ki Mask The Slump God & XXXTENTACION]
I'm on a drug, binge, aye!
Rules, I bend, aye!
Like Constantine, devil want my soul! (esketit!)
Drug, binge, aye, aye!
Rules, I bend
Like Constantine, devil want my soul! (esketit!)
Okay, like, oh no, look at wrist, you bitches whippin' up the bowl!
You not talkin' bricks you been with, get wet like egg yolk!
She not from Dimmsdale, but she gon' give me Dimmadome!
Oh, no, look at your aunt, her feet black just like a crow!

[Verse 1: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Okay like, Doctor Doofenshmirtz
Coat bought my girl work, so it's her collection
I don't pistol pack in Red Dead Redemption
Cowboy boots with the spur
Been lost with the jugg walk
With the sauce, with the saber tooth fur
How do I explain the way she grip on my dick just like butter that churn?
Krispie Kreme, but my sauce never empty
Humpty dumpty, how I crack her
Like a nut cracker, all the best crispy, wish list
Creep, creep
Crawling like I'm just from centipede
Bulletproof vest like I'm 50
Feeling like a public toilet, full of bear hibernation pee pee

[Chorus: $ki Mask The Slump God & XXXTENTACION]
I'm on a drug, binge
Rules, I bend
Like Constantine, devil want my soul!
Drug, binge, aye!
Rules, I bend, aye, aye!
Like Constantine, devil want my soul!
Okay, like, oh no, look at wrist, you bitches whippin' up the bowl!
You not talkin' bricks you been with, get wet like egg yolk!
She not from Dimmsdale, but she gon' give me Dimmadome!
Oh, no, look at your aunt, her feet black just like a crow!

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Guillotine, our team, in that pussy
Why your bitch, look like Ming, with a pussy?
I can't swim
Just like I'm raven, no, "That's So Raven" idea
I had a dream, like I go Martin Luther; I'm rich, I run my crew!
When she suck my dick, she make me feel it in my toes (oh my god!)
She look like she need some dick, she suck me, don't wan' go!
She gon' fuck my nigga for a place to stay fo' sure
You are irrelevant, I'm going celibate
Don't want your bitch, you can keep her amor

[Chorus: $ki Mask The Slump God]
I'm on a drug, binge
Rules, I bend
Like Constantine, devil want my soul!
Drug, binge
Rules, I bend
Like Constantine, devil want my soul!
Okay, like, oh no, look at wrist, you bitches whippin' up the bowl!
You not talkin' bricks you been with, get wet like egg yolk!
She not from Dimmsdale, but she gon' give me Dimmadome!
Oh, no, look at your aunt, her feet black just like a crow!
