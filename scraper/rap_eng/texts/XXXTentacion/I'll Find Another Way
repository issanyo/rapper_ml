[Chorus: MAJ]
When I’m away, my feelings gotta be restrained
I’ll find another way
When I’m away, my feelings gotta be restrained
I’ll find another way

[Verse: MAJ]
I promised on my soul I wouldn’t tell
When you saw me fall you wouldn’t help
Left my feelings all up on the shelf
You were just damaging my health
Sipping the lean oh
I don’t want nothing but green oh
I just pulled up with the green ghost
Sipping the lean oh
I don’t want nothing but green oh
I just pulled up with the green ghost

We live in something, we live in a world that isn’t great. A world that is, uh, understood. The world that, that can be, that can be equalized, but nobody wants to live in an equal environment

[Chorus: MAJ]
When I’m away, my feelings gotta be restrained
I’ll find another way
When I’m away, my feelings gotta be restrained
I’ll find another way

If I didn’t want to help people I would stop making music, to be honest. Well, I mean, like I have now but I saying period. I would stop trying to trying to support other people’s emotions. I’ve been, I’ve been making so much emotional music that it’s become a crutch to emotional people so if I really wanted to, like if I really wanted to just completely disable myself it would be almost crippling to certain people, cause certain people have, has, have used my, my energy and my music as a crutch. So imagine how, how fucking tiring it is for me to have to do this and maintain something. But point blank period, like, I just wanna feel more appreciated for the work I do
