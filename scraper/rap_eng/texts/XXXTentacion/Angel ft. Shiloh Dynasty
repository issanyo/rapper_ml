[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language that’s a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that its been a minute
I said

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
Stab wounds and now shorty you know that you hate love
(Father forgive me, for you know that I'm sinning)
Government and all the monasteries tryna throw shit off
(I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system)

[Verse: Shiloh Dynasty]
Cuz, father forgive me, for you know how shitty I’ve been feeling
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that its been a minute
I said

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
Stab wounds and now shorty you know that you hate love
(Father forgive me, for you know that I'm sinning)
Government and all the monasteries tryna throw shit off
(I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system)
