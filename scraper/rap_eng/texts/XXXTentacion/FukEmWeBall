Yo auntie suck dick

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: SANTZ]
Slaughtering shit, there ain't no stopping it
Pistol whip [?] anger takes over
My body lose consciousness
Way too relentless
Won't stop 'till I'm ruling the continent
Fuck your advice you and won’t stop your barking
Bitch bad but too strong, can’t hold on to
We walk in the place all the eyes climb on top of me
Dragging them down if they’re that real
It must flow like water, ill flood your whole property
Fuck up with us there'll be casualties
One punch fatality
X with that blade, ain't no stopping him
She suck me off 'cause I'm handsome
And pressure is too much
Nobody can handle it
Throw your whole set up, it’s catalyst
Quick Wonder where you will be landing
Members Only
The Conglomerate
There will be history happening
Just be careful cause the rap game we damaging

[Outro: SANTZ]
Ayy, Fuck 'em we ball
Bitches just.. Fuck 'em we ball
Ain't no stopping me so fuck 'em we ball
Run through the streets screaming out "Fuck 'em we ball"
The Cops will not handle this, so Fuck 'em we ball
Fuck 'em we ball, forever screamin' out "Fuck 'em we ball"
Till' the day I drop fuck 'em we ball, fuck 'em we ball
It's still fuck 'em we ball
