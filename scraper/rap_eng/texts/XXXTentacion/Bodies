[Intro: LXRD HIPPY]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor

[Chorus: CRACKA PAUL]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor

[Verse 1: LXRD HIPPY]
I don't give a fuck
Fuck your jacket, zip it up
Patr√≥n in my cup
And the dick, she lick it up
Cum on her tummy
I be really lovin' sluts
I just fuck for fun
Stickin' molly in her butt
Fuckin' your sister for fun
Lxrd Hippy, I am the one
Clip in the butt of my gun
You got a gun that just stuns
Run in their crib, then I dip
Cash for the gold I just hit, ayy
Don't pay that ho, I'm not rich
Mami be beggin' me for that good dick
I just fucked her brain
Now she wants to lie in pain
I'm about to roar
Like a lion in the rain
Think she loves me
When she snortin' cocaine
Pull the fuckin' trigger
Put the bullet in my brain

[Chorus: CRACKA PAUL]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor

[Verse 2: CRACKA PAUL]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the demons take your soul
In the hood, where you ain't safe
Run in your house and we crackin' the safe
Cuttin' your skin, I poison the blade
Chillin' with demons, we hunt in the shade
Don't beg for your life, 'cause it's too late
Wash off the blood, my mind full of hate
And I be trippin', I chill with the stars
Yo they take Xanax, but I got the bars
Split your ass open just like a cigar
They callin' me concrete because I go hard
Bodies hit the floor, it's a genocide
It's a moshpit, bitch, get inside
Hottest D, ho, better run and hide
Hangin' off a rope, watch me slowly die

[Chorus: CRACKA PAUL]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Post up, fucked up, nigga fuck's up
Bitch-made, wrist like slay, aye
Where that bitch? dirty dan aye, fifty grand, aye
I need that in rubber bands, aye
That's a lot aye, break the pot, beat the pot, aye
Like abuse aye, chain tight like a noose, aye
My nose runny like a marathon, marathon
I get head for free I got coupons, coupons
Stuck my dick inside your bitch like a... tampon
