[Intro]
Jah, Jah, Jah, ha-ha
See me
Hip-Hop's a jungle
I'm deep, see

[Verse 1]
It's the revenge of your bitch
She catch attention, in dimension and shit
She got your penchant tattooed to the brim
That bitch looser than the screws in my noggin and shit
She'll take your mula, pop medulla, get to suckin' and shit
Wifin' the bitch, mistakes push brigade out of they momma
Doing her braids, living with momma for the rest of their days
Ain't seen this space, shit, a young Dracula
Fucking all the homies, bet the pussy feel spectacular
She gon' stunt in these shades and buy a thousand dollar lipstick
Ever had a motherfuckin' thousand dollar dick kiss?
Well I did
Hi, kids that she swallowed, head hollow, no brain, go insane
But she gon' stunt, in this letterman, in my letterman
In my letterman

[Interlude]
See, haha
Hip-Hop's a jungle, nah

[Verse 2]
You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more anointed than ordain
More annoyed than an orphan
From Portland who's off the morphine
And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it I’m ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
I’m wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain
Haha

[Outro]
Ah, fuck your feelings, young nigga
Ah, ah, aye, Jah, Jah, Jah
.40 close to your head
All you niggas dead, uh
Haha, we don't play that shit
Basically, you a basic G, basic bitch, haha
Ha-ha, yeah
Shit dutty, dutty
No doubt, yeah
It's so dutty, dutty
Uh-huh, yeah
This nigga's peaked, uh, haha
Rest in peace to your mama, with the drumma, ha
I tote a llama, ha, Jah, Jah, yuh
