[Verse: XXXTentacion]
I need you
Mili rock, I do not mili rock, on any block
Aye yuh aye
Yo' bitch, said yo' dick like waiting at a short bus, bus stop
I did not, beat my bitch
If I did she wouldn't be able to tell that shit
Check it out, I got my new order on the living room
Real nigga, what it is
D Rose, sticks
Your baby got shit and you innocent
Bullet holes, ringin'
I made it out fucks independent
On my rock, Isaiah Thomas
My dick a rock like Dwayne Johnson
Me like to rock when we coppin'
I got a plug out in Compton
Hop out the do-do-do, I'm givin' people the
Ask you get knocked the fuck out, Deebo
I gotta pee, I just might piss in her pussy or right in her mouth
Bitch you got aids, I don't want nothin' to do with you
What are you doin'? I am not movin'
I am not fuckin' that bitch, she is not of the norm
