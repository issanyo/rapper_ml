VERSE 1:
FUCK LIFE
AND SLIT YOUR RIST WIT A FUCKING KNIFE
CUZ NO ONE REALLY GIVES A FUCK
UNTILL THEY SEE U IN THE PAIN
THE SAME REASONS THAT WE MAINTAIN
TO GRAB THE FUCKING SHIT
AND PUT RIGHT UP TO OUR FUCKING BRAIN
FUCK THE BAG ITS FUCKED UP
CUZ THEN U CAN GET LOCKED UP
THEN PUT IT TO OUR BRAIN AND HOPE WE LUCKED UP
HANG THE BOY BY WAY OF THE FUCKING NOOSE (Fuck)
CUZ IT TAKES A PUSSY NIGGA TO MAKE THE NEWS
BITCHES BE ON THE FUCKING NEWS

THE SAME REASONS WHY A YOUNG NIGGA MAINTAIN
TO TAKE THE CLICK AND LEAVE IT RIGHT UP IN YO MAIN FRAME
THE SAME REASONS WHY A YOUNG NIGGA MAINTAIN
... LEAVE IT RIGHT UP IN YO BRAIN

XIOS

ILL BE MISSED WHEN IM DEAD YOU GOT NO REVERENCE
AND ALL THE DEMONS IN MY HEAD BECAME THE RESIDENTS
TRY TO PUSH AWAY THE THOUGHTS WITH SOME DAMN MEDICINE
I WANT YOU BACK AND I CANT SAY THAT WITH MORE EMPHASIS
I WANNA HEAR YOUR VOICE WITH ALL ITS RESONANCE
DROWN IN YOUR THOUGHTS WITH ALL ITS EXCELLENCE
IM DOWN TO GIVE MY ALL AND SHOW YOU SEDULOUS
BUT YOU LEFT ME BROKE NOW IT HAS TO SETTLE IN
IM JUST STUCK HERE FEELING SO BROKEN
ASKING WHERE THE HOPE IS
IM FEELIN SO HOPELESS
I SWEAR THE WALLS GON CLOSE IN
YOU TOOK MY HEART ITS STOLEN
THE DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE AND
IM GONE
