[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
That beat is just weird as fuck
Nah straight up, keep it real over here

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
After I hit metamorph, hey
I am a dog, girl abort, hey
Shoot pregnant wife in a Porsche, hey
That is expensive abortion, hey
I ran it up, fuck a portion, hey
Ain't had no family like orphan, hey
Might sell some xans to the orphanage, yuh
On your face might stomp the yard
On my Mom I'd catch a charge
Play with pussy like guitar
I'm the realest one thus far, hey, yuh
You are just running, a candidate, hey
Your girlfriend said you are minute man, hey
Bitch, my trap house, it got management, hey
I got no heart I'm a manikin

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin
I got no heart, I'm a man-

I got no heart, I'm a-, yeah, ayy
I got no heart, I'm a manikin

[Verse 2: Wifisfuneral]
Like pussy, why you duck my fade?
I stare at Satan in the face
You soft as fuck, like, what the fuck?
I flick my cig and then you fade, ayy
Now since a jit i been in love with that fuck shit
40 clips causing white noise in her voice
That she sniff no distortions
Half a fat check on my teeth like I'm Norbit
OG gas pack to contaminate lungs
Now I'm higher than orbits
Falling off like Forbes list, put the force into her core
I'm the one like I'm Obi, forcing whores to forfeit
Come within my circle, we gone clip your vocals

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin
I got no heart, I'm a manikin, hey
I got no heart, I'm a manikin
I got no-, yeah
