[Intro: XXXTENTACION & Fifty Grand]
Very fucking holy, very fucking rare
Even in broad daylight, I have this dream, I have this fantasy
Marvelous, absolutely mother fucking marvelous, dawg
Marvelous! Tell these fuck niggas I said very rare, yeah
That one day, I go missing, I disappear
And no one can find me
Aye

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm an asshole with a cash flow
I got a bad bitch, she got a pretty pussy
And I beat the bitch like Ray Rice
She won't testify if you ask her
I got molly all on my dick, yuh
That's molly all on my dick, yuh
Got a 40 Glock and that drum niggas
So when I shoot the shit they go "Aye" (Yuh)
Which of you niggas is about it? (Gang)
Now slap the fucker he unconscious (Gang)
You rock Hilfiger fixing to kill niggas
To make the bills bigger, he won't find us
Now play my role to get by (Gang)
I won't harm a fly until I'm tried (Gang)
Burn the fucker, never yearned the fucker
I'ma leave the body in Dubai, aye
