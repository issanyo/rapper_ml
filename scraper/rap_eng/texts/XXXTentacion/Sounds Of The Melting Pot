[Intro: Elliot Gould, Edward Norton & Beverly D'Angelo]
*Scene from American History X*

[Elliott Gould]
That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.

[Beverly D'Angelo]
Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68.

[Edward Norton]
It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a cop-out, it's Opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more.

[Hook]
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke
(Damn)

[Verse]
Jump gang that's 12 people no joke
Said have feelings that's my caron no joke
My coupe with me them stab wounds are no joke
My pack with me don't feel niggas no joke
Uh, eyes locked on my prey
It's follow the leader, you spread and your niggas get sprayed
(Acid, Acid)
I'm eyeing your chain, I'm eyeing your chain,
(Acid, Acid)
What's up with your niggas
they eyeing me like they want to get 'em some

*Woman Screams*

[Hook]
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke

[Outro]
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke
