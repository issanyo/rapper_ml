[Verse]
Valentine, I watched my red rose turn to gray
Let me be, I give your Lord my soul to take
It won't hurt me now, I'm numb to all the pain
Heaven or hell, I don't know which path to take
Valentine, where are you now?
'Cause it's people that I hate
'Cause my heart has run away
Valentine, where are you now?
'Cause it's people that I hate
'Cause my heart has run away
Where are you now, now, now?
Where are you now?
'Cause it's people that I hate
'Cause my heart has run away
Where are you now?
