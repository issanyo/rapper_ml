[Intro: Sheryl McCurry]
Everybody knows about sadness
Everybody knows about sadness

[Verse 1: Evan DMmix]
Known as DMM and I'm bouncing off for your reckless
I'm looking like Lecrae, when I rap so
Strapless
I rap so deeply, I'm sadder than most of y'all, man
Got some wood grabbing me by my leg, and got into the wall, man
I get screwed when somebody tryna make a phone call
I ain't tripping, but I shoot the bag like it's basketball
Picking up and deserve something in my life, that my people do something right
When I be alone, I'm crying
Someone tryna destroy my life
Never let the hate be in your head, let that stuff out
Nah, dawg, don't listen to them, they just tryna bounce
You ain't got to let it in your head, because they say
When everything done in your head, doesn't need to be said

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
Your changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

[Pre-Hook: Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come

[Verse 2: Lil Fog]
I'll end up in pain
Till my blood starts to slain
How did you all came?
Next time, I won't have fame
I hate the game, woo, oh-oh-ohh

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
Your changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

[Pre-Hook: Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come

[Verse 3; Evan DMmix]
Last verse, before the hate comes
Last time, I was so freaking numb
Can't sleep, baby, I don't want no trouble
When we was at the house, you said we are done
Nah, my dawg, the sun's shining on me, silver diamonds on me
Why you crying on me?
Them hateful-you was letting them in your mind
Last time, I was in the school art, they don't feel so kind
They saying I'm messing with them, they acting so blind
I told them “At least I got TikTok”, now they acting like they suprised
By the way, everybody knows about what sadness is
And the hate mad, cause they only rap less, this
Everybody knows about sadness

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
Your changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

[Pre-Hook: Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come
I'll wait, til’ you come

[Outro: Sheryl McCurry]
Everybody knows about sadness
Everybody knows about sadness
