[Intro]
Ayy!
Kodak bop on my cock, Kodak bop
Kodak bop on my-
Kodak bop on my cock, Kodak bop
Kodak, bop, ayy, uh, ayy
Kodak bop on my cock
Haha
Kodak bop on my cock, Kodak bop
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, yuh, ayy, ayy, yuh, ayy
Ayy!

[Chorus]
Walked in this bitch
Dro rolled in this bitch
Sniff coke in this bitch
Clique talk in this bitch
All black in this bitch
Like a goth in this bitch
Slit wrist in this bitch
Grip dick in this bitch

[Verse]
Hopped out I'm grinding, my grillz they all shinin'
Your bitch hit my line 'cause my dick perfect size
And your dick shaped like fries, lil' boy don't be surprised
When I pull out that Glock and it's hot like a furnace
Post on your block sippin' tea like I'm Kermit
Bullet holes all in yo' chest, yo' shit burnin'
Diamonds are wet, see the tats on my chest
In a Young Thugger dress all my niggas are VR
