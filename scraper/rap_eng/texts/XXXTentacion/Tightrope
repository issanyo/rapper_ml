[Verse 1: Scott James]
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Forgive what's said in fear
And all I ask of you is hear
The girl with the golden heart
I killed from the inside out at dawn
The sun's only just arose
Can't amount to all the hearts I've broke
The boy with the broken heart
His goal is to rip everything apart

[Hook: Scott James]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

[Bridge: Scott James]
The oars start sinking
When you let go
To use your hands while speaking
Saying, don't never let us float

[Hook]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave even for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

I must have caught your cold
I could not sleep at all
I'm clinging on for hope
I need you as I'm close
