[Verse 1: Kin$oul]
Nah, I ain't tryna rage
That's all I'ma say
Money on my mind
I'm tryna go get paid
Shawty wanna fuck
She tryna go get laid
Put that dick in her face, okay
Now that hoe a disgrace, okay
Running for the money, ooh
I'm in love with bread, yeah
You talk to the feds, yeah
We heard what you said, yeah
You might end up dead, yeah
Sorry 'bout yo claim, yeah
Crushing, it's a shame, yeah
Yeah, this shit comes from the brain, yeah
Yeah, you might just lose yo consciousness
From all of the times you're talking shit
Wet wet like the martian is
Wet wet like the Loch Ness, peace

[Chorus: Killstation]
It's time for me to keep the peace when all the world is filled with disease
So keep your distance from me motherfucker, I won't say please

[Verse 2: Ikabod Veins]
Pussy boy get smoked like a pack of the woods
Body get dumped in the back of the woods
Pack of the wolves
Teeth rip through your flesh like the blade cut in my wrist
That's death
That bitch on my dick
Bitch blow out my brains, JFK
12 gauge in my face
Feel like Kurt Cobain, aye
In them streets like Ryu
My eyes glow like Goku
That 45 will fry you
That's right hand on my bible
Revenge on my rivals
I reload my rifle
You a rat like Raichu
My gat said I despise you
I'm that guy like Ryu
That means that gon' be the haiku
Mom I just went viral
They ride our wave like tidal
Evil creeps, so I keep a piece
Got bloodstains on my Jesus piece

[Chorus: Ikabod Veins & Killstation]
It's hard to keep the peace when world is filled with disease
So keep your distance from me motherfucker, I won't say please!
