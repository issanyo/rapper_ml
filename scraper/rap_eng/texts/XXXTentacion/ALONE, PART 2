[Intro]
I've had enough of this, goodbye

[Hook]
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim

[Verse 1]
I woke up with the knife in my hand, aye, aye
To murder the bitch was the plan, aye, aye
I will never salvage, feelings are abundant
Many men are of a dying breed
Plunge a knife into his throat
And suck the blood of human out in case it's dangerous

[Verse 2]
I observe the father, walk into an alley
Probably going just to take a piss
Slowly, surely, I will take position
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists
Chop him, buck him, fuck him
I will stab him, splat him, drag his body all across the map
Shower in his fluids, kiss him, bite him, eat him
Threw a fit, and then I take a nap

[Bridge]
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone

[Outro]
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
