[Intro]
"It's crazy, Willie! You can't win. You can't beat them, never!"
Fuck yes, fuck yes

[Verse]
I flick wrist like this, like that
That brave feeling you’re standing for
Beat that bitch, disown that bitch
My dark can’t be content for long
Love her wrist, fuck a silver fist say it like Danny Glove
I ran in that bitch strapped with a Glock
Must be protecting home
Bow wow, 50 Cal ran up in her mouth
Chewy on my Louie, you a money crazed cow
I feel like “quit showing, that fanny make her blowing”
On her knees she’s begging “please” to take a pop of all her pills
Irony, irony, sad it’s all it will ever be
"Honey please, I am not a human being, I'm just a bird who heard their world was to fuck them and make them leave, who heard the world wants to fuck him and make him leave"


[Hook]
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to my jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls

[Outro]
Fuck yes
