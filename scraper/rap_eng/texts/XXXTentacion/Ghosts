[Intro]
Falco here

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Return of the X and the slashin'
Couldn't be, wouldn't be, slits on my wrist for you destiny
Blade's to the Xans for reactions, Catholics
Listen social compassion, rape
Laced with vasses , blast to be casket
Hustlin in the hood, always zen for a capture
Facebook caption, blast to the magic
Tell a fuck nigga that I hate him with a passion

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell

[Verse 2: Nyora Spouse]
Got drugs, mothafucka, laugh like Chris Tucker
All these hatin' ass suckas, never loved by their mothers
Nine lives and you pussy
My main bitch married, my side ho loose
Stupid ass niggas think that they shook me
But I got the MAC and I'm bigger than they could be
Stackin' my bread like loafs
She listen to me and that bitch soak
Flexin', stuntin', bitch I gloat
Off that cake and bitch I float
You sensitive fuck, get the fuck out my face
I'm makin' these moves and I come in first place
I'm stackin' my cash, I got my own place
Play with me, straight bust to the face

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell
