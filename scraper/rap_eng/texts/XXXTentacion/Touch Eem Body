[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
An appreciation cake because Emax bought Eem a new house
Eem new house got a backyard so he can fuck all of these bitches and have a crazy orgy in the backyard
Emax the G.O.A.T
To Bass be the glory

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Scum on these bitches, I slime on these bitches
Want panorama, David Banner, ayo
Pull up, she wetter than water
Watermelon pussy, eat it wit' no manners, splat
Uh, she throwin' that pussy like, "no way"
My niggas is savage, they go play
I pulled up the Honda like, "okay"
Ayy, ayy
Fuckers like, "run it up," pull up in Tonka trucks
Slime on that bitch then I cum
Molly and water, I came for your daughter
And she put my dick on her tongue
Dick is on fleek, skeeter beater, I'ma eat her
Warm it up just like a heater
Call me daddy, I'ma beat her
Run it up, came for your daughter, your- ayy

[Verse 2: Reddz]
Slime on that bitch and I hit from behind (From behind)
Gave her the pipe, all her friends fell in line (Her friends fell in line)
Drown in my children, yeah, she sucked me dry (Dry)
All on her throat like a tie, I ain't even have to lie
Bitch, you better recognize, I'm forever Bad Vibes
She choose the bitches I like (I like)
I turn that hoe to a dyke
I beat the pussy all night
Smoke dope, get high, you can just stay the night
(I beat the pussy all night- night- night- night- night- night)
Sloppy when you top me, baby girl, 'cause I ain't tryna wife

[Verse 3: Bass Santana]
Look, slime on that bitch, spend no time on that bih'
I be rockin' and rollin', I got no apologies
Pull out the stick, yeah, I pull up and flex on my ex
Like, "you fucked up, don't gotta acknowledge me"
Boy, these niggas don't want beef, they just followin' fashion
Don't know why they can't be themself
Slime on that bitch, in the sheets she be hollerin'
Make her go Hollywood, keep to myself (Huh)
Smoke mad blunts, I'm so sedated
How it go, nigga? I ain't the one want to play with
Pussy help me avoid confrontation
Fuck this life, run it up, you can't save us
My dick just can't get no bigger
My bitch know that I'm a no good nigga
Protect your daughters, the wolves is preying
She taste the Matrix and she can't take it

[Verse 4: Kin$oul]
Oh, damn, huh, heh, you like to get sick, huh
Body legit, huh, huh, keepin' it fit, huh
I just wanna take a dip, yeah, I jus' wanna take a sip, yeah
Fat boy in this bitch, yeah, hope you a freaky bitch, yeah
Grab on your breasts, I wonder what's next
Your pussy a mission, and my tongue on a quest
From what I read in the text, I could jus' tell you depressed
I know that you wanna cuddle, you gon' have to give the neck
