[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
You got a head on your shoulders
Why you pretend that you don't?
Couldn't be helped but you just feel it now
You gotta try baby, harder
You got a head on your shoulders
Why you pretend that you don't?
Couldn't be helped but you just stayed and cried
You gotta try baby, harder

[Instrumental]
