[Verse]
Love is not kisses hugs
Sharing fucking drugs
Presents on your birthday
Pictures of making love
It’s dedication
Trust and patience and compromise
Now do or die
Ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading
And I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly
I hate myself for creating
Pain within your heart
And I’m thinking
The spit so tempting to scream it out
To my demons get even within yourself
She’s crying she needs your help
And you’re selfish think ‘bout yourself
All these problems created
Extended from hate with self
And I hope that you wouldn’t leave
But the patience that you would need
Is the patience of several gods
Hanging on to my selfish pleas
And I’m sorry
You deserve better
I wanted more for you
You hanging on
You being strong and I want more for you
As long as you won’t
Leave me in the end
We both can still pretend
That this life we live in is worth it I promise
