[Intro]
Sodomize her, ayy
I’m your pusha man
Cocaine, cocaine

[Verse]
Into the depth of the dark
Fear will swallow your heart
Blood shed in this shed
With this kettle burning red
To your skin full of sin
With a mouth full of gin
Fuck a juice, lose a inch
Fuck your teeth
Put em' on a tee
Jesus mezanmi
Kǔ mā yě
Sodomize her, ayy
I'ma fuck her, ayy
Fuck her soul, Murk!
Fuck her gold
Preaching at the thought
Bloody clot all up in this blunt
Bullet through his head
Now he dead
Fucking walking dead
Murder rigorous
Hershel smoking his purple straight to the face
Bullets on bullets
I'm aiming it straight
Pull up on niggas
I'm live at your gate
Fuck a community
Titled immunity
Folded as soon as we live on the limb
Hoping I die
Preach up on the sin
Life ain't shit
Put bitches in the bin

[Outro]
Dead!
