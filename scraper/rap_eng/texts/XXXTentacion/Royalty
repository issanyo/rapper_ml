[Chorus: Ky-Mani Marley]
Royalty, in the new moonlight
The soldiers yell, on these front lines
I don't know why demons come to test us sometimes
In a scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Royalty, in the new moonlight
The soldiers yell, on these front lines
I don't know why demons come to test us sometimes
In a scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Big up yuh
Big up yuh, Big up yuh
Ayy, Kiara and Lanthia
Use bad man for their
Bread when the mortgage up
Big up, yuh
Big up, yuh, big up, yuh
Y'all are my Kingston
How come nobody wanna hear me on this one?
Man, what's true is that the shit change
When you use me for the money and the cars, you're the big brains
Yeah, it's funny how shit change
When a shorty wanna young nigga drawers, that shit stains
In the whore house, wrist game
Now I'm in the coupe with a crib and it's crisp-ay
Never can forget all the nights it was just pain
Now I'm finna come for the throne, don't forget me

[Chorus: Ky-Mani Marley]
Royalty, in the new moonlight
The soldiers yell, on the front lines
I don't know why demons come to test us sometimes
I scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Royalty, in the new moonlight
The soldiers yell, on these front lines
I don't know why demons come to test us sometimes
In a scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
