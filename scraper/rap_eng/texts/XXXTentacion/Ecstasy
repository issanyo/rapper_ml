[Verse 1: Anekka & Anekka XXXTENTACION]
I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt; and what for?
Going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door
Watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All and nothing aren't the same score

[Verse 2: LIL M!DD$ & Anekka]
Yeah, I don’t need no molly (I thought you got all you came for)
Ain’t no sheep I’m a Border Collie
Without you I wouldn’t be sane
Don’t need drugs to kill the pain
All these comments, humiliation (I thought you got all you came for)
All this advice, I don’t need that shit
The sea ain’t the only water flowing
I need warmth but my heart keeps snowing
Yeah, What the fuck am I doing? (I thought you got all you came for)
My misery and sadness I’ve been brewing
When I be smiling all of y’all be booing
When I’m down all of y’all snooze
Except her, she’s my high (I thought you got all you came for)
Don’t no need candy to get me high
Don’t need no one else she me ride or die
Look to sky, she ain’t here so I cry
(O-oh) they transparent like glass
When will I be the one to laugh?
(O-oh) they act all opaque, they heart is plastic, fake, my tears awake
(O-oh) another barrier, when will the path be finally clear?
(O-oh) another fear, one day it’ll just be you and me, dear

[Verse 3: Anekka]
Shut her down
Going to take you outside
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt
When it's over you'll be golden
Over, over
Shut her down
Going to take you outside
Sucking up the dust from your static crown
Just the time away you'll be golden
Over, over

[Verse 4: Anekka]
I thought you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time?
Right

[Verse 5: LIL M!DD$, Anekka & XXXTENTACION]
(O-oh) feeling lonely again and again
How many of you are really my friend?
How many of you are here ‘til the end?
And how many of you are here to pretend?
(O-oh) everyone be judging me
Always talking shit about you me
I wanna be alone please
Alone just me and girl, just leave me
You’re my Ecstasy
I need you here with me
You make me so happy
I need my Ecstasy
You’re my Ecstasy
I need you here with me
You make me so happy
I need my Ecstasy
Release my pain *laughter*

[Verse 6: Anekka]
I think you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone
Overdone

[Verse 7: Anekka]
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone
Overdone

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
I'll fuck you better on everything, on everything
Your pussy was meant for me, was meant for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm havin' withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you done to me, you done to me
The pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one, your only one
I know I was wrong, wrong, wrong
Pop that pussy for X to see, for X to see
I want you right under me, te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck you with everything, everything
I want...
