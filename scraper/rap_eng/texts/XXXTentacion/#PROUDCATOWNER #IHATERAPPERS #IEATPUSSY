[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus]
Oh she ratchet, I might smash her
Bend her backwards, I might pass her
Homie on Casper, geekin' like Dexter, I think magic, no distraction
Yeah, my flow's on Destructo Disc, too afraid to cuff a bitch
These boys on that sucker shit, feature price went up as shit, like

[Verse]
"Oh, big deal, are you Satan?", I reply like "Are you playin'?"
Slurp on pussy like Lo Mein, I'm Progressive like Flo, man
Therapist knocking at my fucking door, man
My body just look like G.I. Joe, man
Feds askin' questions, I donâ€™t fucking know man
Kim Jong Un to the fucking flow, man
Like whip, lash like whip, lash like whip, lash like whip, mm
Diamond baller, broke my shoulder
She wan' fuck but can't come over (aye, aye)
That bitch suck, hit the running man, mm
Hopped out of jail with a hunnid bands, mm
KKK, I'm just hanging, man, mm
Chris Rock, niggas acting funny, man, hm
My money stretching like Luffy, uh
Like Disney, these niggas is Goofy, uh
I don't fuck with snake but like Gucci, uh
These niggas act fool for some coochie, uh
I will not go back to jail, uh
These niggas is blind, need braille, huh
Watch how I switch, watch how I switch
Nut on her, switch, watch how I- mm
Nigga, where the fuck is your energy, cannot mimic your enemy
Play pawn defending me, I can palm you niggas
'Cause I warned you niggas, I never swung you niggas
I don't need no motherfuckers shoulders to lean on
Wet up your pussy, I treat it like ding dong
Harder than the Kim Possible theme song

[Interlude]
Yeah re- real quick
I just-I just really wanted to say all you rappers suck

[Chorus]
Oh, she ratchet, I might smash her
Bring that back 'cause she seen my pastor
Homie on Casper, geekin' like Dexter, I think magic, no distraction
Yuh, my flow's on Destructo Disc, too afraid to cuff a bitch
These boys on that sucker shit, feature price went up as shit like

[Outro]
I been trying to tell these niggas
I got- I got the Krabby Patty formula man
Come fuck with me!
