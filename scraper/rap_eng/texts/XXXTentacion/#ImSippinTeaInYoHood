[Intro]
Yeah
You know I'm posted in the booth with the boof with Ronny J
Gotta get in the mood, haha
You know how I'm rockin'
Gang, gang, gang
Ronny J produced it!

[Verse]
And boy I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up, you buttercup?
Purrp in that blunt, smoking suicide, bloody blunts
Pussy boy you talkin' shit for Twitter, it ain't addin' up
How these pussy niggas moving day to day?
I've had enough
Post with that fucking blade, bitch, I'll skin your face, huh
Dick on that fucking gun, I love it when they run
Fuck all that talkin' shit, do that shit for fun, uh
Fuck 'round with these niggas, ayy
Stab a body- fuck do you mean?
Post with that Glock, aim that beam, ayy
Put that shit right in yo' spleen, ayy
Run through yo hood, ayy
Fuck nigga what's really good? (bitch)
My niggas wish that you would, ayy, ayy
