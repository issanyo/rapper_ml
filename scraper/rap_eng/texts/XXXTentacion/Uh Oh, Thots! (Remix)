[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Criss-cross, applesauce
Ride up on my croggy, uh
Eat the blade, no Rick Ross
I got some ape, no Harambe, uh
Nobody sayin', that she sayin'
She say she wanna tuck my denim
If you think that X is broke
Then look at my motherfucking banknote
Okay like, are you okay Annie?
In a phantom like I'm Danny, huh
I'm tryin' to fuck your granny
Tryin' to get dagger dick in her panties
Said she really wanna touch 'eem body
But I just want brain like a nerd, rocka
Shout-out to 333rd
I'm flippin' the bird, this bird is the word, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
