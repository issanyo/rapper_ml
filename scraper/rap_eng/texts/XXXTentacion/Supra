[Verse 1: Kin$oul]
Everlasting pain, blinds my brain
Smokin' on dank, to hide my pain
I ain't gon' lie, shit won't change
Fuck the system, I ain't playing no games
Words like ammunition, click, clack position
One shot to your head, information was given
Nigga, shut up and listen
I'ma show you a vision
And take your mind on a mission and understand why you livin'
These niggas ass rappers, full-time actors
I can kill a track, even if I rap backwards
Fuck a studio, all a nigga need is a Macbook
And a little bit of drugs and a Backwood
And I'ma start spitting my pain
All of this shit in my brain
I don't think nothing's gon' change
But there's motherfuckin' money in the bank
Ooh, yeah, got my minds on some other shit
High as a mothership
Surprise, how I'm stuntin' bitch
Polite, with the pussy, I say "hi" when I'm comin' in
Talk all this shit, but the truth, you ain't got it bitch
Shawty hit me up, told her I will be there right away
Hide your partner pussy, pop a xanax, sleep my night away
Wake up, feelin' like this won't be the finest days
But it gets more better, smokin' the finest haze

[Chorus: Kin$oul & XXXTENTACION]
Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing
Might just use a weapon, just to send a message
Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing (uh)
Might just use a weapon (ayy), just to send a message (uh)

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
And it always seem like all the fucking voices in my head
Is tryna see me dead, before I see my mother wed
And I remember way back when, when I was dead
Broke, I was a fucking joke
And nobody wanted to fuck with me
Remember sleeping on my nigga Will bed
Doing anything just to make sure his nigga fed
And now I'm recollecting all the fucking tears I shed
Just to get to where I am
And everybody wanna fuck with me
Remember bed bugs, bed sheets that felt like old rugs
And now we finally made it out the damn slums
Remember bitches actin' like old nuns
Now they pop that pussy like porn stars if a nigga want some
And that's a damn shame
I'm not ashamed, if you press my nigga Kin
Bullets rippin' through your damn brain
And that's for anybody fucking with my clique
I feel like Yeezy, 'cause ain't nobody fucking with my clique
Jah!

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga
And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga
And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga
