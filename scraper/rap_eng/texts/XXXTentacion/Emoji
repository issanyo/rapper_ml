[Verse 1: Ronny J]
I don't really give a fuck
If you got a boyfriend
I only want you for a night, yeah
And I can't pretend, Imma' beat the pussy up
Young nigga, yeah I like to fuck
All this money get you up, all this money get me up
Baby don't act a fool no, this ain't nothing you know
You can get it loud yeah, girl that pussy up
Every fucking time, yeah, when I come around
You know, what I got for you
Don't play yourself
If you're coming through
Bring a friend or two
For my nigga, what it do?
She just too down for the crew
All I know is get the paper
I know we need some acres
For chains on, you fakin'
Might flight you out to Jamaica
Couple bands on me
I'm about to go hit the strip, lickety-split
Wish I was with you baby
I want you to ride this dick
Watch the pussy, jump in it for me
Still don't know, why they hate on me
Lay it, lay it down with a little foreplay, no play
Roll up a doob in the Gatti, I'm going
So hard on they bitches, they know that I'm poppin'
Bitches still all on my dick
Cause they know I am Ronny and they know I ain't floppin'

[Bridge: Xxxtentacion & Ronny J]

Oh my God, no one can stop me, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Xxxtentacion]
And I'm popping, yeah yeah
Girl get off me, yeah yeah
Oh you want me, yeah yeah
She was swinging, grinding on the pole
Pop a xannie, she don't know
My nigga with me rolling stoned
Tell your nigga, you not coming home
Girl I hope you honest
For I'm all that on your mind
Girl I really like
Make you fuck her from the back
I don't understand you
You don't know your problems

To fight me
Oh you like me
You got me
Wanna fight me
You a bad girl
You look gone girl
Whatchu want girl?
