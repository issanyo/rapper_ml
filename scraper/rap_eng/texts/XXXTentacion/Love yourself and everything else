(Intro: XXXTENTACION)
Ooh, Ahh
Love yourself
Take no chances, Fuck them niggas
Ooh, Ahh
Love yourself
Take no chances, Fuck them niggas

(Chorus: LilQUiNN)
He was, trying to change
Then he died, now we all know his name
He was, trying to change
Then he died, now we all know his name

(Verse 1: LilQUiNN)
Feel pain
Wanna put ten shots in my brain
Everything around me is the same
I hope this world will change

(Verse 2: LiLQUiNN)
When he died, all his fans were sad
Then he released Bad!
I'm so fucking Mad!
I wanna fucking end it
I'm so tired of this fucking bullshit
I'm so tired of this fucking bullshit
Wanted to say "You know what? Fuck this!"
So I sat down and wrote this
'm so tired of this fucking bullshit
I'm so tired of this fucking bullshit
Wanted to say "You know what? Fuck this!"
So I sat down and wrote this

(Interlude: XXXTENTACION/LiLQUiNN)
Ooh, Ahh
Love yourself
Take no chances, fuck them niggas
Ooh, Ahh
Love yourself
Take no chances, fuck them niggas
