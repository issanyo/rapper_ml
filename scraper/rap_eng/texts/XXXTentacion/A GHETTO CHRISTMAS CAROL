[Intro]
Yeah
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus]
It's a vibe, yeah, feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet, got a nigga throwed (Yuh, yuh)
So much ice, yeah, fantasize, yeah
The city lights, got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night

[Verse]
Don't crash, don't crash, you're movin' too fast now
More cash, more cash, might throw it on her ass now
Butterfly on the whip, that's a nigga doors
All my hoes super thick and don't keep no legs closed
I got stripes like Adidas do, uh
My whip the color of Beetlejuice, uh
Peter Pan, Gucci fan, look at you, uh
Nigga you hatin', you bitchin', you, ay
Niggas be whinin' like bitches and uh
Nigga quite frankly don't get that shit, ay
These niggas bored, they irrelevant, ay
Niggas be watchin', these niggas be

[Chorus]
It's a vibe, yeah, feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet, got a nigga throwed (Yuh, yuh)
So much ice, yeah, fantasize, yeah
The city lights got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
