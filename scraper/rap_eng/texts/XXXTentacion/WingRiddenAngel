[Intro: XXXTENTACION & Nicole Dollanganger]
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Wi-Fi's off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I held the ground you walk on
Yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
