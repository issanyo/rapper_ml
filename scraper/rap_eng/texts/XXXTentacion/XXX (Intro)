(Uuuh)
(Dun uhn duh duh duh duh duh)
(Dun uhn dun dun dun)
(Dun dun dun uhn dun dun duh)
My name is my name, (Uh uh)
(Duh dah duh duh duh)
Don't ask me my name (Duh duh)
(Duh dah)
Don't ask me about me
(Duh duh duh duh dah duh)
'Cause you don't wanna know
You don't care to know
Don't ask me how I am
(Duh dah dah duh duh duh duh uuh)
Don't ask me about my plans
Just observe what I do
(Duh duh duh duh duh dun dun)
Just watch like everybody else does
And don't pretend to know me
(Duh duh duh dun duh uh uhn)
Don't pretend you're enjoying my company
Don't pretend I'm not crazy
(Duh duh duh duh duh duh uh duh)
Don't pretend to love me
Don't prete-
(Duh duh duh duh duh uh uh)
Don't pretend none of this hurts
And I won't pretend to feel
(Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh duh duh uh uh)
(Duh uh uh)
