[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & MaxoKoolin]
Maxo
Wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold
Diamonds on me, water, H2O
Diamonds on me, water, H2O
Wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold
Diamonds on me, water, H2O
Diamonds on me, water

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Okay like, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
I'm gon' make her H2O, out her pussy hole, okay like

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & XXXTENTACION]
Wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold, wrist too cold
I was chillin' in the 90210
Body bag him if he try to take my hoe
I think I hit my peak, I'm high as a eagle beak
She's wet as Dawson's Creek, I just made a mil no Meek
Bitch I cut off the leash, I do not want your yeast
Peace to the Middle East, I want your Reese's Piece

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION, Ski Mask The Slump God, & MaxoKoolin]
Maxo
Okay like, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Got her wetter than water, what is your fuckin' vendetta?
I just be beatin' her pussy, I'm not a gentleman
Vetements, suck up on my denim, cost a settlement, settle
Hop up on that booty she shake it like snake, rattle
If she say she want a spanking, bitch I'ma beat her with a paddle
Then I pop up in front of her just like a Yu-Gi-Oh! battle
I need a triangle diamond, bitch I'm American Idol
Got her pussy so watered that I'ma have to phone Tidal

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, H2O
I'm gon' make her H2O, out her pussy hole, okay like

[Outro: MaxoKoolin]
