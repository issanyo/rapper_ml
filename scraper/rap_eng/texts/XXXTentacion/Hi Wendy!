I just want some neck, top (Huh?)

But all titties matter (Ah)
LIl' bitch, I'm an animal (Ah)

Kick her out if she say "nigga" (What?)
Hit the joint, but crossed the fucking line
I like hoes who know they limits (Bitch)
Nappy boy, bitch, don't touch my hat (Bitch)
Keep some rubbers in my denim (Slatt)
I just hit the hoe, you calling back (Ah)
Ugly niggas always winning (Huh)

Fat boy, eat it like a snack, aye
Sorry if I miss you, I'ma hit you right back

Can't wait to call that toolie
Let a nigga run up, ouu
Scare his ass like Scooby-Doo

Fat boy eat you like some goddamn food
