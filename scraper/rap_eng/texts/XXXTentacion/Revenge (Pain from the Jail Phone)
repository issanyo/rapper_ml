[Verse]
I'll fuck you better on everything, on everything
Your pussy was meant for me, was meant for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm havin' withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you done to me, you done to me
The pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one, your only one
I know I was wrong, wrong, wrong
Pop that pussy for X to see, for X to see
I want you right under me, te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck you with everything, everything
I want...
