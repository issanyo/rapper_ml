She's falling in love with someone else
She's falling in love with someone else
She's falling in love with someone else
She's falling in love with someone else

Late nights feeling heartbroken thoughts in my mind that will never spoken
Walk outside and show no emotion
Deep inside feel my heart exploding from all the pain
Try to detain cos' no one can know of the hurt in my veins
Try to restrain
All of the hurting form showing
But when i'm alone can't stop chasing i'm rolling
Long nights,long night had a long fight with myself
Yeah I think I'm losing my mind
When you ask imma say I'm doing alright
But my depression only moving onto new hights
Hope you never have to know what it feels like
To love somebody that loves somebody thats not you
But no matter all the pain I still got you
Yeah no matter all the pain I still got you
Hope that you getting the message
Hope that you don't feel my depression
This music for me is like a theraphy
Session I'm rapping but honestly I just be letting
Hope you don't ever get filled with aggression
Hoping it wasn't always embracing imperfections
Hoping you don't have to look back and regret em
I love everyone but I'm my own exception yeah

Falling in love with someone else
She's falling in love with someone else
She's falling in love with someone else
Falling in love with someone else
