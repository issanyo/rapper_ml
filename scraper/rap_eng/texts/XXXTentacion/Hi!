[Intro]
You are now listening to your girl's favorite producer, Lowkey Damian

[Verse 1: VIDAKK]
Catch us smoking like a Newport, choke her
Fuck her out of breath like it's a rally race
I'ma cross her, leave her messy pasta
I'ma (uh) in the pussy, I Rick Ross her
Come on baby, know you drive me crazy
Watch me onomatopoeia on the bitch
Stupid, stupid, bussin' shots like Cupid
I'm a little ruthless, swifty coat like Uzi
Rocket like Kiss, bitch, you know how I'm rockin'
Ain't Chief Keef but that bang up in my pocket
Sloppy toppy, then I break her pockets
Dance up in that pussy, watch me go in stomach

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Fuck on a bitch, make her water water
Super duper super slutty sister
Fuck on the bitch ain't no huggin', no kissin'
Ain't no cussin', bout to beat up your (ahh)
Beat it up, beat it up, Hannibal
Make the pussy the new cancer
Fuck me, suck me, beat it down for daddy
I'ma lick the fatty, I'ma dive in
My wrist fat like my K
When I'm in the pussy, I'm r√°pido
I got the diamonds from Africa
I could pay ya momma car note
I'm on my rebound right now
Slob on my knob like a waterfall
I'll pull up, slaughter your daughter
Keep her mind right like I'm a Tylenol
