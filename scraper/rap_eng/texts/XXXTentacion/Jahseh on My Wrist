[Intro: Bass Santana]
Uh, ooh
Too much dope, in all (Boy, patient, talk shit, Members Only shit)
Too much (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Too much dope, in all black, ooh (Ooh)
Too much smoke, who try'na match, like, bitch
Send that shit to me on Cashapp (Wait)
Send that shit to me, no bounce back (Like whoa)
Hit that, break that back like a Kit Kat, uh
Kick her ass out the Airbnb
Flyin' high, you won't miss that
Jahseh on my wristband, miss me, huh
With all the bullshit, keep all the drugs, I'm litty, uh
Fix me, uh, you need the plug, bitch
I need a lick, y'all wit me

[Verse 1: Bass Santana and KiD TRUNKS]
Ok vool, bitch, but it's Members Only keep my goons lit
Voo bitch, who gon' run up on me, you a fool shit
We gon' school shit, you don't see my vision, fuck your movement
I'm fuckin' lucid (Uh), fallin' off the edge I just might lose it (Ayy, ayy!)

[Verse 2: KiD TRUNKS]
You can't feel our pain, they took our brother out the game (Huh)
Not in vain, but you will remember about his name (Aye)
It's a lot of you rappers stealing clout and chasing fame (Selling clout)
I got some enemies (Huh), they will remember me (Huh, huh)
Smokin' weed in public, 40 deep sippin' Hennessy (Hennessy)
You got all the bitches that be givin' out STDs (Ew, ew)
Ali, Brandi, Christie, all my girls right like ABCs
Yes I drip, no I won't fuck that trick
I don't wanna lick (Huh), that's it (Huh), then pass that shit
You can't even cash that shit, I don't want a black-haired bitch like (Huh, huh)

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Ooh, too much dope, in all black, ooh (Woah)
Too much smoke, who try'na match, like bitch (Uh)
Send that shit to me on Cashapp (Wait)
Ooh, send that shit to me, no bounce back (Like whoa)
Hit that, break that back like a Kit Kat, huh
Kick her ass out the Airbnb
Flyin' high, you won't miss that
Jahseh on my wristband, miss me, huh
With all the bullshit, keep all the drugs, I'm litty, uh
Fix me, uh, you need the plug, bitch
I need a lick, y'all wit me (Uh)

[Verse 3: Flyboy Tarantino]
I got M's, really I'm on ten
Bitch, don't play with me, no friends (Oh no)
I don't need no fake niggas crossing me again (Oh no)
Pop out, watch me slide, Popeye spinach in them cans
Catch an opp out with no fire, we know how this story ends, uh (Damn)
Blood of my blood (What)
Flesh of my flesh (Uh)
Bust open his nose since a nigga wanna talk fresh, uh
I go, they go (What)
I flex, they flex (Uh)
Catch a buck 50, fuckin' with my MO niggas, we press

[Verse 4: Craig Xen]
I can't keep too many niggas 'round me 'cause they envious (Hm)
Movin' independently to keep the ambience
If I panic, Im'ma do damage
And ain't no bandages gon' manage to alleviate leaking, and Im'ma stand by that
I'll die by my word
Your pride could get you split up
Divided, and left to rest and piss on that curb (Hm)
My nerves bad (Huh), I'm disturbed on the verse, so don't urge me (Hm, hm)
Ya heard me

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Ooh, too much dope, in all black, ooh (Woah)
Too much smoke, who try'na match, like bitch (Uh)
Send that shit to me on Cashapp (Wait)
Ooh, send that shit to me, no bounce back (Like whoa)
Hit that, break that back like a Kit Kat, uh
Kick her ass out the Airbnb
Flyin' high, you won't miss that
Jahseh on my wristband, miss me, huh
With all the bullshit, keep all the drugs, I'm litty, uh
Fix me, uh, you need the plug, bitch
I need a lick, y'all wit me
