[Verse 1]
Rap for the nap of a sack nigga
Who blizzardous raps bigger than men of a pack, ren
To the top of the gat, rippin, I'm busting up wack niggas
Chart or a plaque, nigga, what do you choose?
Simply irrelevant, hm, cynical evident
Please, wrestling evidence
Keys moving when definite
Soul goes for the president
Bleed red for the government
Tease-

[Verse 2]
Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Pictures on your birthday, pictures of making love
Its dedication, trusting, patience and compromise
Not do or die ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading, I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly, hate myself for creating
Hate within your heart, and I'm thinking this pistol tempting
Screaming out to my demons, get even within yourself
She crying, she needs your help, and you selfish
Think 'bout yourself, all these problems created
Extended from hate for self and I-

[Outro]
Ah, that's all I got right now
