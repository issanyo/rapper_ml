[Speaking]
Worse thing comes to worst, I fucking die a tragic death or some shit and I’m not able to see out my dreams.
I at least want to know that the kids perceived my message and were able to make something of themselves and able to take my message and use it and turn it into something positive and to a...  to at least have a good life.
I atleast... If I'm gonna'... If I’m gonna' die or ever be a sacrifice, I want to make sure that my life made at least five million kids happy or they found some sort of answers or resolve in my life, regardless of the negative around my name, regardless of the bad things people say to me.
I don’t give a fuck, because I know my goal in the end and I know what I want for everyone, and I know what my message is.
So I just wanted to say I appreciate and love all of you and believe in you all.
Do not let your depression make you.
Do not let your body define your soul.
Let your soul define your body.
Your mind is limitless.
You are worth... You are worth more than you can believe.
All you have to do is dream and all you have to do is want to fulfill that dream and have the strength.
