[Intro: XXXTENTACION, Xen Fro]
No matter what anybody tells you each every individual in here is a star
Yeah, okay

[Verse: Xen Fro]
Feelin' alone, I’m feelin' alone inside my head, I'm feelin’ alone
Feelin' alone, I'm feelin' alone inside my head, I'm feelin' alone

[Chorus: Xen Fro]
Still goin' no matter what
Still goin' no matter what
Still goin’ no matter what

[Bridge: Xen Fro]
Yeah, I feel crazy right now
Ice

[Verse: Xen Fro]
Feelin’ alone, I'm feelin’ alone inside my head, I'm feelin' alone
Feelin' alone, I’m feelin' alone inside my head, I'm feelin' alone

[Chorus: Xen Fro]
Still goin' no matter what
Still goin' no matter what
Still goin' no matter what

[Outro: Xen Fro]
Yeah
Ice
