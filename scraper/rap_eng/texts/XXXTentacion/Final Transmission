[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
No one can create your purpose for you
No one can tell you who to be

[Verse 1: scribbletest]
As I float through the abyss of nothingness
I promise this, I won't be missed
I promise that you won’t ever see me again
Look at my life
I gotta leave it behind
I gotta figure out a way, so I'll forget mankind
I put it all on the line
Leave Earth behind
Live a good life the way God designed, yeah

[Verse 2: scribbletest]
Right now I feel confined, just a little claustrophobic
Livin' in this tin can, I feel anaerobic
But we’ve reached out destination, this planet was my motivation
Look out the window, well damn, there's a new land
When I land my tin can, looks as if I've landed in a grassland
Put your helmet on, cause you know it could be dangerous
Never mind, it's paradise
Nothin' here to endanger us
Never though I would obtain this, yeah
Never thought I would make it

[Verse 3: scribbletest]
A life away from my life, this is what I call paradise
I already said it twice, I really try to be concise
What's the price?
Lose all the people that I really love
But that don't matter now, I'm doing what I love
Always try to follow your dreams, and do what makes you happy
I’m usually not positive and honestly, that sounds sappy
But I promise, once you find something that really makes you happy you won’t ever feel pain
Forget what made you unhappy
Do something with your life that's therapeutic
For me, that’s music

[Outro: scribbletest]
Always try to stay positive in the worst, uh, conditions
That's just the best advice that I give you
It really makes everything better
Thank you for listening guys, I'll see you in the next album
