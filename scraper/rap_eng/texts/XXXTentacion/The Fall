[Intro]
Fool's gold is a common man's trash
I've seen God, I've seen devils, I've seen many men...
Mothers, children, fathers...
I've seen The Fall
Fuck the naysayers, the conformants

[Verse]
Black Benz, and the
Black friends, when the
Nigga feelin' so killer could put a kids in a
Chokehold, them living with no soul
A pity, how niggas pity me, kitty with no goals
I jump, fall, neck snaps, I slip not
I told 'em cold in the weather so we can get-got
M5, two of them, we fucked in
And I remember December when you was tucked in place
Is the place, man it's cold
And they chose this place so you could never fall
So beware because the fall is all we know
An empty corpse around parading in the snow
Fuck

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Yea, yeah
Aye, yea

[Outro]
THIS IS IT
Yea, this is all we know, this is all we know
Y-y-y-yea
This is-this is it
Yea, y-y-y-yea
This is-th-this is all we know, this is all we know
This is it
Yea, yea, yea
This is all we know, this is all we know
This is it
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
