[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
(Na-na-na-na-na)
Na-na-nah-aha

[Chorus]
Depression
And obsession don't mix well
(Na-na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na-na-na)

[Verse]
I'm poisoned
And my body don’t feel well
(Na-na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na-na-na)
I hate her
Inside and out I feel my stomach turnin'
Make out hill
Where we met we let our lips do all the talkin'
And now
I'm hooked and…
(Na-na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na-na-na)

[Chorus]
Depression
And obsession don't mix well (Well)
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
Depression
And obsession don't mix well (Lalalalalala, lalalalala)
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
