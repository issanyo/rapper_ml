[Monologue: Corey]
I need to talk. Man, it's been a whole about four months without you. I've been in the worst pain in my life. It's been so crazy, some... sometimes I forget how to eat, or sleep, I hardly even function right. I miss... it's so weird not calling you every day, making sure you're okay. Sometimes we'd talk for hours, sometimes we'd talk for minutes, talk about all types of things. Sometimes we'd joke around, sometimes talk about some deep conversations. To being at your house every weekend for six months straight playing League with Illie, Rico, and Leo, to being on Ice and Will, to riding out on... on the road, and just talking about life and have so many ideas just bouncin' back to each other. Listening to the new, listening to the albums, to the music. You taught me so much these last few years. You taught me how to be a man, how to assert control. Taught me how, how to deal with certain things didn't need to be dealt with, how to block out the negativity, and all that energy I didn't need. I could go on and on forever, for all the memories we had, but damn. Think I've shared so much, it's like every time we got off the phone, the last time, the last time we talked, the last thing you said was, "I love you." I love you, Jah. Thank you for everything.
