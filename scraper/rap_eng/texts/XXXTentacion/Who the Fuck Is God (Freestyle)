[Intro]
God...
Who the fuck is...
Who the fuck is...
Ayy...
Cocaine...
Ayy...

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I’m fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it’s written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn’t see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull
And so...
If there's a fucking god, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men
Innocent
See, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck shit hoe

[Verse 2: Sully the Chief God]
It's Sully the Chief God
Hold up
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as our ego takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down on my knees
Bow down on my knees
Fuck that
Smoke that DMT

[Verse 3: Absentwill]
You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ayy, ayy, that I once told...
