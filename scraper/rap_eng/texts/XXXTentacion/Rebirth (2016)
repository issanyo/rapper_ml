[Monologue: XXXTENTACION]
Pay attention to what you're doing in your life ‘cause your life is right in front of you, everything you need is right in front of you. Even if you're broke, even if you're broke, dead broke, it's because it's supposed to be like that and everything – the people who struggle the most or get it the hardest will succeed in the end, I promise you. You will not have the hardest life forever. 
Everything will come to you, what you deserve will come to you. And if I end up getting shot and killed for what the fuck I'm doing, or if I end up getting my ass beat at some point in time, or, or, nigga, if shit get hard on me, it's because I deserve it. That's point-blank-period. Everybody will get a death that's – everybody will get a death that is deserving, everybody will get a life that is deserving, everybody – you will get what the fuck you deserve. Karma, point-blank-period.
