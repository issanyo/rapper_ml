[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS & XXXTENTACION]
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm doing drugs so I can maintain
Part of the reason that I can handle this damn pain
"I'm fucking numb" said the lonely heart of the drummer boy
Who'd rather wreak havoc than play around with a Tonka toy
Uh, shit, my mirror ain't been clearer lately
I see my mind becoming blind, material mistaken
Heart indulging in the things that are forever broken
I seen a father lose his son, why life so fucking hopeless?
Uh, ayy, concept of my depression is
That there's no fucking recollection when your birth begins
And there's nobody there to hold you when the pain begins
But there's somebody there to fold you when you're caving in
Uh, yuh, such discussed by such and such
You're a fucking loser, man, well, life's a fucking uppercut
Right inside my fucking gut, wanna fuckin' end it but
I don't have the balls to fuck, I'm such a pussy, fuck me up

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS & XXXTENTACION]
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Won't be reminded of the lost days
Used to rob the plug for all his work so I could maintain

[Outro: KiD TRUNKS]
No, I can't feel no pain right now
Lost in the skies while it's rainin' down
Numbness and hell, what we crave right now
No, I can't feel no pain right now
