[Chorus]
Where you said you going?
He can't fuck you like I can
Where you said you going?
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can

[Monologue]
I, I didnâ€™t remember much
Her teeth and uhh...
It definitely stood out
I remember her smell and her touch
The way she used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me
And even all the time I spent, it's all pointless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore
Save me
