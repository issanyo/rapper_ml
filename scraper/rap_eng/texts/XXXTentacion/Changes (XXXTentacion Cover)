[Chorus]

Ooh, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Ooh, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Ooh, baby, I don't understand it

[Bridge]

Girl, you're making it hard for me
Girl, you're making it hard for me
Girl, you're making it hard for me, ooooh
Girl, you're making it hard for me
Girl, you're making it hard for me
Girl, you're making it hard for me

[Chorus]

Ooh, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand
(violent coughing)
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Ooh, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it (crying)
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Ooh, baby, I don't understand it
