[Intro]
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head

[Hook]
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head

[Bridge]
Thoughts in my head
Thoughts in my head
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
Thoughts in my head

[Verse 1]
I went and I'll count the tears I shed (tears I shed, tears I)
She sat there and watched as I bled

[Bridge]
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled

[Verse 2]
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
And where did you go as I slipped? (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
And where did you go as I slipped? (as I slipped)

[Hook]
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head
