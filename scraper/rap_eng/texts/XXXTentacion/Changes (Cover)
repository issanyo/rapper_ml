[Chorus]
Mmm, baby , I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand it

[Bridge]
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me, oo, ohh
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me

[Chorus]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

[Chorus]
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
