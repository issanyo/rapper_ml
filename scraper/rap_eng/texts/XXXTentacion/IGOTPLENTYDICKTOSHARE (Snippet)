[Intro]
Yuh
Ayy, yuh, ayy, yuh
Aye turn up a little would ya?
Ayy, yuh, ayy, yuh
Had to hop on a different booth on these niggas
Ay, yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, ayy, yuh
Voot up, voot up, voot up

[Verse]
Bitch want my dick, pop that pussy like a zit, yuh
Fuck do you mean that I'm mean? Suck my dick, yuh (bitch)
Stay with that Glock, I won't run from the opps, ayy
You see a shot? Thatâ€™s not me, that's the cops, ayy (buck buck buck buck!)
Stop it, aye, Gothic, aye
Might rip the head off the prophet, aye
Andy my clips, Milonakis, ayy
Empty that bitch it ain't nothing, ayy
Fuck ya, aye, pump him, ayy
I put his mouth on the carpet, ayy
Stomp on his head and then perf it, ayy
Hope that shit-talking was worth it, ayy
Duffel bag, think a nigga need a duffel bag
You brought your boy, you duck your bitch
Pressure, son, think these niggas want pressure, son
I grab the gun, extended clip
Pussy boy, leave you bleeding like a pussy, boy
You need a pack
You need a pitch

[Outro]
Oh fuck
Aye, pipe up man, turn up turn up
