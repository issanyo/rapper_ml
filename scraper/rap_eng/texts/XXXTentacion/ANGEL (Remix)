[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language that’s a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Stab wounds and now shorty you know that you hate love
Government and all the monasteries tryna throw shit off

[Verse: MXDED & Shiloh Dynasty]
Father forgive me, for you know that I’m always sinning
I take no interest partying with liqour, fucking up my system
Excume my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
