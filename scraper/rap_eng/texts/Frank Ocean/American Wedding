[Intro]
American love, American me, American you
American tear, American heartbreak, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with

[Chorus]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law

[Verse 2]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy, fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"

[Chorus]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce

[Verse 3]
Well, you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh, if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do
