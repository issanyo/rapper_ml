[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I know I'm not weak, these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind, oh, I
I got cargo with me
All these memories feel
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I been moving buses, further and further
I just can't do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

[Chorus]
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload

[Verse 2]
Drag my life along by the end of a rope
Trying to make by, I'm trying
On the other side, someone's tuggin' hard
They only getting stronger, oh, I
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me out, help me out

[Pre-Chorus]
I been moving buses, further and further
I just can do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

[Chorus]
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

[Bridge]
I been tryin to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands
Can't hold up the world
It's coming down, it's coming

[Chorus]
Its too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me

[Outro]
Overload, overload, overload
Overload, overload, overload
