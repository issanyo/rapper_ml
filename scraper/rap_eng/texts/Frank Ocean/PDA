[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me (Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy

[Hook]
Public display of affection (Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, we is, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, you being tense
Has got me convinced
You're the fingers to my instrument

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the lobby to the patio (Boy you're so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible

[Break]
The club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Outro]
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
