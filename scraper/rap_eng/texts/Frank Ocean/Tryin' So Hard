VERSE 1:
Never expected it would take so much pretending
I ain't over you and that’s a fact
I even threw away all the gifts you got me but in the present I'm still wrapped up in the past

HOOK:
Anything that I ever do boy, everything reminds me of you boy, everywhere I go I see you boy, just can't seem to shake you off...whenever I hear our song boy, whenever I smell your Cologne boy, it takes me back to our love and I can’t escape you

CHORUS:
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy
It's hard to keep going on when you're still holding on
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy
It's obvious and it shows and I just can't let it go
I stay in my hive, time won't wash away
And though we're apart somehow you managed to stay
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy

VERSE 2:
Driving down a boulevard and everytime I see a blue BMW my heart jumps cause I think it's you
And when I’m grocery shipping I go down that aisle
And I see those chocolate coa-coa pebbles that you like

REPEAT HOOK AND CHORUS

VERSE 3:
Our chapter is done but I can’t seem to turn away
Made up my mind
Tried and tried boy but its taking way too long
Trying to stay out of dodge
