[Intro]
Crazy, I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
Crazy, na na

[Verse 1]
Talk to me and I better not hear a word
Do me baby, oh I better not feel it girl
Baby, I still got one bullet left in my nine
Finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime
Finna do a lovecrime

[Hook]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes

[Verse 2]
You write me love letters with your father's pen
If he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it
Is it really wrong that I want to be the baby daddy?
Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? Tell me it's a lovecrime

[Hook]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
Oh, yeah, yeah
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two

[Hook]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes

[Outro]
"Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women it's just about security, and commitment, and- and whatever the fuck else! If you men only knew. But you're not the jealous type, are you? You've never been jealous about me, have you? And why haven't you ever been jealous about me!? You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?"
