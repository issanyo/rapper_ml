[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Bridge]
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

[Chorus]
Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

[Outro]
Stay at your best baby
Let me know, let me know
