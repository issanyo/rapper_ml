[Verse 1]
I've seen it and I liked it more
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why you walk like that (that, that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

[Pre-Hook 1]
Didn't have a pick up line to use
Way to cool, way too cool
And instead I'm hoping you're watching me too
Like I watched you

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

[Pre-Hook 2]
You in HD baby
Didn't know what to say
I'm way too cool, way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Bridge]
I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
