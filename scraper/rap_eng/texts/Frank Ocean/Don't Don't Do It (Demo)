[Intro: Frank Ocean]
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
On the up and up this life
Til' we're down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine (oh, you scared?)
On the up and up this life
Til' the lift gets stuck (you scared of?)
Lifting up, lifting up
Lifting up
Coming down, coming down
Coming down (I don't mind)
Make 'em look, make 'em look
To the sound

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They tell you pull over, tell you get out the car
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up your arms (Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
We were going home
Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, they're gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
I'm not your guy
(But you know, they're gonna do it anyway)
Wife behind the trees
Tryna to tell you don't
They're about to fire
(They're gonna do it anyway)

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway
They're gonna do it anyway

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They tell you pull over, tell you get out the car
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
They wanna see your hands, tell you hold up you arms
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it
(Something says)
Don't do it, don't don't do it

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Whoa Ferguson, oh Baltimore
Raleigh, North Carolina
But you know, they're gonna do it anyway
Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma
Cleveland, Ohio
Montgomery, Baton Rouge, Cincinnati car
Dayton, Ohio
But you know, they're gonna do it anyway
New York, New Jersey, Phoenix, Minnesota
South Carolina
They gonna do it anyway

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway
They are gonna do it anyway

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
