MY RANDOM

I miss all the tension
When all this is over
I’m moving to ghana
You sus and you watching me
They used to be brown
Now them contacts is green
Why the fucks u finessing me
I know how many licks
It’ll take me to get
To the center of ecstasy
How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don’t have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale
When the seraton’ gets a lil low
When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don’t remember
No tales cus it’s two heads
Even twelve got a lil forgiveness
Who do you love?
