[Verse 1]
I remember being immortal
I though that I was
I wanted to conquer the world
Before I could drive

I remember when you were born
Ohhh, how happy I was
Cause If it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances

[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you I’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
(o) Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it

[Verse 2]
You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent

And when your outside running
It's ok to as where you're going
So you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went

[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy, I'm jealous of you i’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time X2

(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it
