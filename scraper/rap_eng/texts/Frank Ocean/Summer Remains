[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
It's too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Leave it in the ground
Better not cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't (yours)
Saltwater swole my eyes (yours)
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes (yours)
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
It ain't natural

[Outro]
(Right hand in yours)
I'll be right (yours)
I'll take (right)
(Yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Yours, yours
