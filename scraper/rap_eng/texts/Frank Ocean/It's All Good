[Hook:]
Thought that I was dreamin'
When you said you loved me
Yes, it started from nothing
Had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And it started from nothing
Oooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate you now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down, is good
You broke my heart last week
I'll probably feel better
But if we can still remember how you'd hold me
As you're screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good

[Verse 1:]
If I could see through walls
I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental
Like an armor truck
Nah, nah, we ain't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
I'll never be a kid again
We'd try to see if Heaven exists back then, back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Life was chill as fuck back then
We were friends...
