[Intro]
When I was younger I used to wonder like

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun"
We could go to my house after school, after school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late, off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And every time somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say, "Yeah"
They say, "No fair, no fair, that's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well"
And every time a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say, "Yeah"
They say, "No fair, no fair, that's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge 'cause, hell, if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah-dah, dah-dah
Lah dah-dah, dah-dah, lah dah-dah, dah-dah

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more, no more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm So Far Gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus]
Now every time somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Naw", they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear I never do it"
And every time a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say, "Naw"
They say, "Who do you think you're kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"
Fair enough, you see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Now I'm singing lah dah, dah-dah â€˜bout heartbreak
And now I'm singing lah dah, dah-dah 'bout love lost

[Outro]
(Harmonizing)
Damn [laughs]
I'm saying though, like all I write is love songs
I mean I try, I come to the studio I-, you know what I do
What do you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, ever
But if you were, you might fuck with it
Yeah, all these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you
