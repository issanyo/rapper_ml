[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

I told her that I missed her put her on a plane
Goyard luggage just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga I wouldn't be the same

She met me at the W grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it so glad she came
Told me she was in love she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane she didn't feel the same

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

I made a change for my baby a difference for love
And I ain't frontin' feel like you were the one
I got the rain girl if you want could have my name
Girl if you want

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love

If you been searching to long
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling the at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love
A sucker for love a sucker for love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]

So now we're loving the winter flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me the crush has been insane

She's a 1 of 1 D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good she wish that it would stay

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love

[Chopped Hook: Frank Ocean]
See baby looking so long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love [x4]

Been searching too long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love [x4]

[Fade Out: Frank Ocean]

Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh
Love, we did for we did it for love love love
