[Verse 1]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

[Verse 2]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or somethin', she said "Is it game or somethin'?"
"You pullin' the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

[Outro]
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh
