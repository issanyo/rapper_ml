[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
(I'd rather live outside)
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm a fool (?)
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (Brave)
I'm not brave (Mind out here)
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool

[Verse 2]
Living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Maybe, two kids and a swimming pool
Two kids and a swimming pool (I'm not brave)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
Other side of the moon

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
(Speaking of Nirvana, it was there)
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot-
