[Verse 1]
Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there’s no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can’t do this revolving door any longer

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe it’s the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that’s what made us close
And now that’s the very reason
That we’re slamming doors
But we’re both adults, it’s time we get over it

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won’t be no fighting, I’ma throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah
