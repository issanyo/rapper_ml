[Verse 1]
It's 2 am
Got a call
From a girl
You should know
She heard a noise
Got a little scared
Now you of all people know
She hates sleeping alone
But still you ain't home
So since you're nowhere to be found
Don't trip bro I'mma hold her down

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not hating
On your situation
But all I'm saying
These chicks are crazy
You've got a good girl
Who's all about you
It's gonna take you losing her
For you to know what you really had
On the spotlight
But as soon as you drop the ball
I'll be ready to pick up where you left off

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot


[Bridge]
To be honest, I ain't perfect
A saint by no means
But I'm on the outside looking in
And it ain't a pretty picture by no means
I could push up on her but that ain't me
I'm a just sit here and wait my turn

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend
You don't treat her like your supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I'mma step up and do what I gotta
As your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking
Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot
