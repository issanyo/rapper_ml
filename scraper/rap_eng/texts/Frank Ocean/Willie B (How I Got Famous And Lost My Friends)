[Verse 1]
My best friend
Won't call me back
I need a little bit of light 'cause now I'm coal black
I've grown up and I'm older
I can't change, I fold up
Willie B, will I see that you come back?
It's been a little too long for me to trust that
My bed frame, my sofa
It's different, I'm older

[Chorus]
Is it the shape I'm in at the moment?
How did I get my skin so cold?
How did I get my lips so frozen?
How did I get my friends so old?
Is it the place I'm in at the moment?
Is it the mind I thought that I know?
How did I get my lips so frozen?
How did my friends get so old?
(I won't talk to anyone that will not talk to me...)

Is it the shape I'm in at the moment?
How did I get my skin so cold?
How did I get my lips so frozen?
How did I get my friends so old?

Is it the shape I'm in at the moment?
How did I get my skin so cold?
How did I get my lips so frozen?
I won't talk 'til I get old

[Instrumental Change]

[Bridge]
Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the bickets out next week
On me on, my bodness

Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Let the LED roll, deal on 'em
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the bickets out next week
On me on, my bodness
