[Verse 1]
No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 2]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 3]
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror
