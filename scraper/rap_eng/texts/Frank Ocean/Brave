[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face, yeah
Large crystals hang from your ears
Are they here
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move
To settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
So what would you recommend I do?
I'm living in the city, yes
Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah
I'm living in an ideal
An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
I'd rather go to jail
I'd rather try hell
Or I could be a fool
And settle, for a place with a nice view (nice view, nice view)
(For a place with a nice view)

[Hook]
I would do anything for you
Yes, I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I'd do anything for you....
(Anything, anything)

I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
For you
For you
