A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn’t rain in
Southern California much like Arizona
My eyes don’t shed tears but boy they pour when I’m

Thinkin’ ‘bout you (Ooh no no no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout you (You know know know)
I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever

No, I don’t like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don’t love you, I just thought you were cute that’s why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don’t get to fly it though
I’m lying down

Thinkin’ 'bout you (Ooh no no no)
I’ve been thinkin’ 'bout you (You know know know)
I’ve been thinkin’ 'bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget
How you feel
And though you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit keep it alive
We’ll go down this road until it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin’ 'bout forever
