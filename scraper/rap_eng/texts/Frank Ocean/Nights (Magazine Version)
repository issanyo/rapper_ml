Round your city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe till I evaporated
My whole body see thru
Transportation handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working thru your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a saiyonce
You are from my past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

New beginnings ahh
New beginnings wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being late on me
You know you need the money if you gon survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit that's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit everynight shit
My everyday shit everynight shit
Night shit
Night shit
Night shit
Night shit
I'm buck now
I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon chyoon chyoon
On they heads like chyoon chyoon chyoon
Remember that
Them hands yea
Them strokes oh don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday
Every night shit

I'm buck now
I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon chyoon chyoon
On they heads like chyoon chyoon chyoon
Remember that
Them hands yea
Them strokes oh don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday
Every night shit

All my night
Been ready for you all my night
Been waiting on you all my night
I'll buzz you in just let me know when you outside
All my night
You been missing all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's getting me right

(Wet Wet)

Every night fucks everyday up
Everyday patches the night up
On god u should match it it's that KO
No white lighters till I fuck my 28th up

1998 my family had the acura
Aww the legend/
Kept at least 6 discs in changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we  could only eat at Shoney's on occasion

After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my night shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit everynight shit
My everyday shit everynight shit
