[Verse 1]
I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it
Cause in the words I could still hear love
Somebody still cared
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yeah

[Hook]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Chorus]
Try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try, try

[Verse 2]
It's breaking my heart to see you there
Sickening I hate standing at that station
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame
Tears in your eyes
Luggage at your side

[Hook x2]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta work too hard
Tryna break my heart
But don't try, don't try, don't try
You ain't gotta work too hard
Trying to move on ohh oh
Try to stay
Try to think

[Chorus]
Don't try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try
Try, try
Just try
