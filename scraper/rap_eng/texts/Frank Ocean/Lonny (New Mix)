[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around me
I can't do without you
Shawty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in a hour
Just be ready

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

[Verse 2]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

[Bridge]
Ayo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one, ayo
Oh baby, I'mma take it slow
I don't wanna let you go, never let go
Oh, I know you been patient
Been waiting for this moment
Right here, right now

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

[Outro]
Hey yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Hey yo
Hey yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Hey yo
