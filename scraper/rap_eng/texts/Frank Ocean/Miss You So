[Verse 1]
I’ll stack these magazines in the corner
After I’m done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you’ll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I’m older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn’t make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don’t last…
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I’m older, and my mind’s telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you

[Verse 3]
No videos, no polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn’t fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so…
