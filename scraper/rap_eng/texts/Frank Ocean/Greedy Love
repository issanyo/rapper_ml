[Verse 1]
I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Verse 2]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Bridge]
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask?

[Hook]
When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
