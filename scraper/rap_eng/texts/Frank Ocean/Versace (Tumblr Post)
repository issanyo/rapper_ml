Versace, versace, I'll play the piano
I'm not liberace
You could say I'm taking that grammy
Your music is sloppy
Nigga's is heated they keep on repeating the evening
In Slow mo'
I sold enough records
I'm selling out cities I don't do no promo
Marina Abramovic Riccardo Tisci Madonna Beyonce
And Conatella if you don't believe me
Believe what the blog's say
We was all at the table
It was a debate
Then we came in agreement
That Twitter ain't relevant anymay really
I'm finna delete it
My Instagram allover Internet anyway
Don't think I need it
Skrrr
Got bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
On bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
I'm runnin' that Porsche for the winter
If you trna follow the leader
I need a sabbatical do an apprenticeship under Domingo
Study Carreras and Luci
I ain't finna rush out a single
I get it when artists go loopy and lose it
And get into opiates
Like when you get all that you wanted
And that shit is not what you hope it was
You had a formula
One hit the wall now you Aryton Senna
You had you a lady she hurt your ego
Yea
I'm wearing some dickies they cost 30 Euro
I'm not even into Versace
