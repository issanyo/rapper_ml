[From Snippet]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Whatever you do, young king, don’t wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Cause even diamond chains are for slaves
Don’t set foot in no penitentiary
And don’t taste the poison
Don’t you bail on your families
