[Intro]
I just wanna make love
I just wanna make love
I just wanna make love

[Verse 1]
Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
I'mma hit a few keys, bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now, ow
Fix you up another Mai Thai, Thai
No sun on the horizon, on
Let's make a song for the night time, time

[Hook]
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

[Verse 2]
Stroke of harmony, kiss you on your neck
I'm changing up your voice sound (changing up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
And make you climax now (ah ah)
Now we switching up the melody, ay
We take it down to a minor C, C
We making noise like we can't believe, ay
Let's put this moment on replay

[Hook]
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

[Bridge]
Oh
Girl, watcha' you wanna do?
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
I think I got a clue
Girl, watcha' you wanna do?
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

[Hook]
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
