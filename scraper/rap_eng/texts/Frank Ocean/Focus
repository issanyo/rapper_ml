[Intro]
I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic
Let's go

[Verse]
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

[Pre-Hook]
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

[Verse]
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

[Pre-Hook]
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

[Bridge]
I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
