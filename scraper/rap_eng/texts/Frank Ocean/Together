[Verse 1]
Oh, we’re in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we’re all children
We’re all human, we’re all breathing
We’re all needing, more than what they're giving
Can’t you feel it?
The space of what’s missing

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you’ve convinced yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together, we’re together

[Verse 2]
I love you
And I don’t know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who’s going through it

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
But don’t you look down
Don’t you convince yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Bridge]
I’ve searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together
