(ey, ey, ye eye, ey ey) x3
Never seen a cloud
(upclose baby)
Never left the ground
(before baby)
Never fucked the hundred miles up (uup)
Never been in love

But if I never met yo ass
I would never know how it feels to crash

We get laid, smooth
It's heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag

(uuh, uuh, uuh, uhaaa)
(uuh, aaah, ha, uuuh)
(uuuh, oooh, oouh, ooh, aah, aah!)

Just stay alone
(this earth lonely)
Im watching everbody get on
But deep down im scared to drive back home
Cause last time it went up, it down, down down...
In flames

But if i'd never met yo ass i've never known have it feels to crash
We gettin laid, smooth (damn)

It's heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..
