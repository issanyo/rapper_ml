[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Verse 2: dvsn]
God has my soul but you have my heart
Will string to the end, that's where we'll start
And it's a long way, you're lost
I lose myself, I found you
You're like kinda like I found you
Could you use that if I can't guide you
That to me, I'll be

[Hook: Frank Ocean & dvsn]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
It's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
