[Intro]
Go for it

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody, being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporate
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G!)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you (Biiitch!)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You were from my past life, hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first, signal coming in and out (Huh?)
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani (Ooh, nani, oh)
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ugh!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, everyday shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit

[Verse 2]
Bubble goose down, blue punch
Pocari Sweat, ghost sweat
Her wet wet, her mouth wet, two things I don't regret (Uh)
My dick long, memory long, two things she don't forget
Game drives so wet, my Black friends just wear black
But only fly in black jets, if it's roulette, black's best
Niggas ain't sold crack yet
Flyin' private, ain't wasting seasons
Niggas lapped up in that bitch
Black bodies in the summer breeze
Runnin' four flats, tryna get in the lead
Tryna get in the league and play wide receiver
Nigga, pass the sticks, call winners winners
Up-seat, gotta walk it off
Winners hate to lose, gotta run they mouth
Sets thrown, now they lockin' up
We ain't break it up
Tryna see who face getting knotted up
That was Monday, we was back friends on Tuesday
Still talkin' 'bout it 'til this day
Need fifty hunnas, that's 5 racks
Hit Costco, keep the fam fat
Fuck a weed-man, grow your own plants
Tell the cashier give you five blacks and the purple packs
Some loud burnin' out on the grill
Black Adonis on the diving board
Gainers only, I'm bringing Guinness
Jordans floatin' on the deep end of the pool (Yes)
Somebody got thrown in again, y'all are fools
Phone drown on the concrete in the summer blaze
Blaze too, blaze too
And it better work when the morning breaks through

[Break]
Oh we gon' line it up? Nah, nah
I just... What?!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
[Inaudible talking]
New beginnings wake up, akh
The sun's going down
(I just got these shoes man)
Time to start your day, bruh
(Look at 'em... Look, they're fucked)
Can't keep being late on me
(Some more fuckin' shit)
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
[Inaudible talking]
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, everyday shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit

[Bridge]
I'm buck now, I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
On they heads like chyoon chyoon chyoon
Remember that, them hands yea
Them strokes, oh, don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday, every night shit
I'm buck now, I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
On they heads like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
Remember that, them hands yea
Them strokes, oh, don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday, every night shit
