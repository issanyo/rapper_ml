Yeah it's that lemonade
First Class yeah you know this is The Cook Up lets get it
O.K. I'm spitting these abortion bars all up on this lemonade
Got these other rappers really wishing they were never made
I'm always in the game these niggas never played
My gears always fucking sharp like I'm wearing blades
I only spit just so that I can get paid while these mothafuckas do it so they can get laid
I've been have these chicks open. Marcus Colston
Grabbing for my dick like a rebound. Postin
I got two bad chicks I call it double trouble and they both 10s that's a double-double
They got fat asses that's a double bubble
When they playing with my balls that's a double juggle
I'm serving up these bars call me the bartender
They say I should sell my rhymes but I'm not a bar vender
Man I just keep goin (goin) call me a machine
One of Octobers own but this ain't Halloween
I'm a punck line maniac this is my routine
The way I cook up all these bars you would think it's a cuisine
I'm not an undergroung artist more like a submarine
Got these mothafuckas bouncing kind of like a trampoline
I'm from that east coast, east side, EA we live we fly G5
Smoking up we high
Got your girl wet so I'm going in deep dive
The reason why all these schools buzzing. Beehive
Every where I go I always got my back pack
And girls ask me if I want to hit Black Jack
I'm made of money call me a casino
Make the haters sick to their stomach I should give them a beano
And I'm dangerous Scarface kind of like Pacino
When you see me call 911 Reno
Got a chip on my shoulder but I don't mean Doritos
And these niggas all beans it's a wrap burritos
I'm eight bars from greatness
The haters can't take it
The head above the shoulders I just see them shaking
Look I'm kind of gas I really can't fake it (no)
'cus if the right gears here my shit I'mma make it (Imma blowing up)
Yup man I know I'm gonna be blowing up and when that time comes I'mma drinking till I'm trowing up
In the club sipping bottle after bottle seeing 20/20 nigga I an't got them beer goggles
Chicks grinding on my slow moving like a snail man
And they open up for my delivery. Mail man
Look I got this on lot like a gel man
You think I'm being funny like Doug. Quell man
Dog I'm so serious
(not really)
