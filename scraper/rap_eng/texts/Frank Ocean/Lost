[Verse 1: MØ]
Double D
Big full breasts c'mon my baby
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus: MØ]
And now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2: MØ]
Got on my buttercream
Silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?

[Chorus: MØ]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost

[Bridge: MØ]
Lost, lost, lost
Lost, lost, lost
Lost, lost, lost

[Chorus: MØ]
And now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
Lost, lost, lost
