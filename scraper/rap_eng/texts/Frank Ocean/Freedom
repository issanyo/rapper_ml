[Verse 1]
I saw the train coming for me
With the force of a million marching
(Train coming in)
But I believe in us
(Train coming in)
I felt the eyes of so many
The whispers and shouts about
My belief in us
(Whispers I hear)
I believe in us
(Shouts in my ear)

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
That don't scare me
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it all in public
Hold a press conference
To speak about my freedom
My freedom

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Verse 2]
I flew away this morning
What if I ran away and never came back
(I ran away and never come back)
And all of the fame means nothing
It's all a game and the gladiator just won't win
(its all a game, just a game)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
Don't bring scared to me (no no)
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it out in public
Hold my head high
I'm a speak about my freedom
My freedom!!!

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Bridge]
Free to run, on the water
Free to believe, free to love
Free to speak that mountain off the ground
I believe in us

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Outro]
My Freedom
My Freedom
My Freedom
Freedom, freedom
