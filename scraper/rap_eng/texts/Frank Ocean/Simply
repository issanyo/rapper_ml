[Intro]
It's simple, so simple

[Verse 1]
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Interlude]
My mother said "son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple"

[Verse 2]
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Bridge]
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, cause they're simply too short
Without love

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love
