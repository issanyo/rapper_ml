[Verse 1]
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cos it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna' clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Bridge]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cus ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away
