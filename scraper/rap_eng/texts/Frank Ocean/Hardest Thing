[Verse 1]
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain’t a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain’t here

[Pre-Chorus]
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

[Verse 2]
I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn’t matter
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

[Bridge]
Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still
