[Verse]
Grand mommy told me "Don't run from no police" (Fuck 'em)
Grand mommy told me
"Watch out for yo partners" (I love 'em)
Saying "They too much older, won't you stay in your range?"
I been trying to sponge, been trying to know some things
See the mailman keep coming, and the bills keep on coming in
And all you wanna do is fight me on this shit
You say: "Don't go bending yo wrist
Don't go being no sissy." OK
"Don't go locking no doors
You ain't paying no rent in this bitch," OK
Checks I used to bring
They wouldn't make no difference in this bitch
Now the checks I bring, I mean
Who else paying the rent in this bitch?
Landlord see me outside, wanna take a picture
I said I gotta autograph on the check you can take it with ya
He said "The house on sale, you wanna buy it?"
I say, "Not this one."
Gotta make moves, not a ton of moves, tryna keep it simple
This summer
Said you didn't wanna go with me
That's a bumma, bumma, bumma, yeah
Boppin' at Bacchus, that was the first parade
Bounce remixes of Aaliyah had the spinal cords crackin', crackin'
Cups of methazine had 'em lean like Michael Jackson
Yeah
And you was fuckin' with your nose trying to be a Jackson
Oh yeah
Poolside convo, about your summer last night
