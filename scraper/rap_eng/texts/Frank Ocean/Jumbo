saturday I'll wake up in central london
stretched out lil low on serotonin
cus last night was extraâ€™d out
place both knees on the ground
then ask god what he's talking about
before i kiss him on the mouth
God himself breathed in and out
last night i had a dream
Gyllenhaal on a mountain top
holding on two stone tablets with ten commandments
and a flower crown power couple propaganda phamplet
black panther and white panther you could run the jungles sleeping free on the tree branches no light pollution
look how slow all the life is moving once you get your heart racing
today if i survive i'll let my feet leave the ground
levitations and revelations
take me up in your rapture now
