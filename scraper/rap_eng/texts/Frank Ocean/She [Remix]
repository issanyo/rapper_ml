[Lights Out]
The name's lights out, and my flow too
I provoke you, them pussy juices flow through
A pair of lips that I would kiss if I could hold you
But I ain't ever satisfied, and yourgasm is old news
Sometimes I wonder if it happened
But still I savor every single word of your reaction
I tried tell you, but I just had to show you
You came around a couple times and loved it, but it's old news
You didn't wanna fuck, you made it very clear
I didn't finish up, you couldn't fuckin' get me there
You could've had the dick, decided you would rather split
And now you're getting pounded by some faggot, I'm astounded, bitch
What's that? oh you don't like the sound of this?
You know you still remember my tender fingers around your clit
And don't pretend you never doubted it
I'm here to tell the truth, reality checks and balances

[Frank Ocean]
Blinds wide open so he can see you in the dark when you're sleeping
Naked body fresh out the shower, you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom, you're sleeping alone in bed
Check your window, he's at your window

[Lights Out]
Now I would never advocate taking advantage of a woman
I'd like to have my fucking way with you, but I couldn't
It doesn't mean I'm gonna show up at your window
With a mask that's colored green, and while you sleep, I'm in your bedroom
Your subtle curves disturb my thoughts, I'm going mental
And my brakes could never handle all the trouble that I'm into
I'm not a stalker, it's just that I'm in lust
And maybe once upon time it was love, now I just wanna fuck
I think I've seemed to misremember what your name is
Or maybe I don't give a fuck, cause honestly, I'm faded
Come to think of it, I don't know where my brain is
Cause my dick is in your pussy, but you're passed out on the pavement
I'm really sorry, I never meant to hurt you
But understand you've done enough to me to serve my purpose
It's just a fantasy, I'd never fucking rape you
But in my dreams are places I would never fucking take you

[Hook, Frank Ocean]

[Lights Out]
At the door, on the floor, in the closet or the basement
Hiding in the shadows I'm just waiting ever patient
When everyone's asleep i'll slowly creep beside your bed
And spill my guts in cursive for the purpose of my head
Because you're my fucking counselor
And if you're not the queen, then what the fuck'd I fucking crown you for?
You had never come around before, we never fucked
And I just wish I had a chance to mount you more
It seems like all we did is kissing
And you had hole inside you, I could tell something was missing
But you were having none of it
Not from me, I know that you were sitting on another dick
But that's just how a bitch is
I wonder if my fingers were covered up in his liquids
I'll never understand it though
I think it's time I let you speak, where did all my manners go?
But I could never shut up
Every time I spoke it just became another fuck up
Even now I probably should shut my mouth
But I need to get your attention, I need to just let it out
Having pipe dreams of benjamins and fucking trophies
Statuettes of astronauts and plaques of records, golden
I mean you kinda like that guy that's in the US open
Not the one that won cause I'm the one that left the records broken
You didn't used to come in second
Before you fucked me over you were royalty I reckon
That you never gave a fuck, it's clear that you didn't fuck me
I guess if I had to guess I would say that you didn't love me
Good vibes from bad girls with book smarts
I'm attracted to these women cause they look smart
But they always let me down
The weather's gotten colder ever since you came around
