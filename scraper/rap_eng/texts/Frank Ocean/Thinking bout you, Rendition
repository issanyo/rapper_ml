I've been thinking bout you
You know know know
I'v been thinking bout you
You know know know
I've been thinking bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya , do ya

Verse:
I've been thinking
Bout the thing that we call the future
Can it come, any sooner
Stuck in my heart is the voice of a dreamer
Young hiroshima
Blow up the mind of the doubters
Spiritual doctor
He can heal your hate
We can never make a connection if we don't relate
By my faith, Got me
Feeling optimistic for the things that I see
See through Jesus so we can walk on Seas
I'm way above average, so what I see is not what you see
Its not C
I pray for the grace to be amazing
Sing along to my songs like hymns
Praises be to him
But my future is all I think about

I'm always thinking so far, ahead
I've been thinking bout forever
Thinking bout forever
I'm always thinking ahead (3x)
You know
Ive been thinking bout forever
You know
