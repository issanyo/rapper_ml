She gone!
Ain't coming back
Like the keys to the lac
I used to see ya
I used to love ya
I used to kiss ya
I used to hug ya
Where'd ya go?!
I'll never know
I miss ya head down to the toe
I miss them kisses
I miss the fire
I miss the love
I miss that life
Tired out my my my mind
Lost all my money and my time
I used to be the best, now I do not grind
Shawty where'd ya go
I lost my mind
Tried to find ya
Tried to love ya
I miss ya food
When ya cook
Now you ain't never gonna, hear a reply again
She gone!
Ain't coming back
Like the keys to the lac
I used to see ya
I used to love ya
I used to kiss ya
I used to hug ya
Where'd ya go?!
I'll never know
I miss ya head down to the toe
I miss them kisses
I miss the fire
I miss the love
I miss that life
She gone forever
She was so flyy
Me and her
Her and I
Can I see you one more time
Before the day I die?
She asked me questions
I asked her "why?"
She said, "I love you"
No reply
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
She gone!
Ain't coming back
Like the keys to the lac
I used to see ya
I used to love ya
I used to kiss ya
I used to hug ya
Where'd ya go?!
I'll never know
I miss ya head down to the toe
I miss them kisses
