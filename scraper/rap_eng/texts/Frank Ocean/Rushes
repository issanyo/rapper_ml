Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
You cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
Its a (Rush to the head)
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you....)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop
All that happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off, they know
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I be up to my feet
I'll wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week
It don't matter
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down

What stays and what- what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid-
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
