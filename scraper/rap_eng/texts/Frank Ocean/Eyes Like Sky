[Verse 1]
Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Bridge]
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
