As Julius I’m here to seize her sights

Thus I’m cruising down the Nile a mile from Luxor heights

Ocean says She’s working at the Pyramid tonight

Frankly I don’t doubt our legion view’s right

See traffic is rapid and the horn blowing incessant

They took Cleopatra and laid my guards silent

The throne of my Queen is empty and absent

Thus understand I’m here in no kind manner

All traitors will soon hold death’s banner

As the Chandeliers inside tremble from her voice

Cymbals crash the side until you make the choice

Remove your hold and bring her back delicately

Because she’s headed out the pyramid with me preciously
