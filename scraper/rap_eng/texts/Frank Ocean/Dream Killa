[Verse 1]
You said I'd never make it well I'm here
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams
You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe

[Pre-Hook]
Say I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Verse 2]
Villain with a dagger was chasing me
I woke up and you were standing right there
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
Then I asked you what's that in your hand

[Pre-Hook]
You told me I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sleep good as soon as you're gone
But I can't dream good as long as long as

[Hook]
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, (dream killer, dream killer killer) x4
