[Hook: Mr Hudson]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue (blue)

[Bridge: Mr. Hudson and Frank Ocean]
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream dream dream, I still dream

[Verse]
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on, think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone (too)
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and

[Hook]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

[Outro]
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, No
