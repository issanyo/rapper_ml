I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothing
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still down is good

*If I could guess your password, you know I'd break in
To the empty hall that you keep my face in
Deleted scenes, where I took off my shirt back then
We couldn't take our food back then.*

I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
*I had a twin
Took out all the mids back then
Back then
No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then.*
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothing
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still down is good

*In the moon, in the nighttime
You came back alone with the flashlight
Had to admit I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then.*

You ain't a kid no more
*We'll never be those kids at all.*
It's not the same
*The (hard part?) is over.*
Don't you remember?

Broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy, screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
*We could start again with nothing. *
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling's still down is good

All the things I didn't need to say *that I said to you
There were things you didn't need to say
That's okay too.*

*Baby
I could dream all night, dream all night
I could dream all night, dream all night
Dreammmmm...*
