[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the reason we don't get down
So I'ma let you do the leading and follow you now
See, I just don't usually do this
But you're bringing me out
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

[Verse 2]
I didn't even see you coming
It was such a surprise
I wasn't expecting nothing
Now I'm lit up inside
Your bringing out all the colours
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold
So here I am, we're good to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
