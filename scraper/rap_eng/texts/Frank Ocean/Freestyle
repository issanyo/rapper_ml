[Freestyle: Frank Ocean]
I didn't think even think about this shit
But your bitch finna get a mink about this shit
You know what I'm saying I'm on Fifth and Broadway in this bitch
And now I'm at New York with my clip on my wrist
Yeah, nigga it's twelve on my wrist and twenty on my neck bitch
Yeah, you know what I'm saying, it's really nothing
And I really got the bars going, really nothing
And Basedgod ain't this fucking based
And get this camera out my fucking face
