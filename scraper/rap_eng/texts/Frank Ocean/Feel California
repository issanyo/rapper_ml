[Intro]
This is how molly must feel
How molly must feel word
Molly must feel, word
Know what I mean
Know what I mean

[Verse 1]
Coming to you live, from California, California
We can drive half way across the stateside of California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And all I see in the sky is sapphire blowing clouds of diamonds
Ive got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to do nothing to do
The beach is kind of average but the mushrooms are magic
When we've got nothing got nothing got nothing to do nothing to do
Im signing off the network I hope you're down to try to
There must be something something something to do

[Verse 2]
Coming to you
From California California
We can fly half way across the world now
From California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And if you ask me why the birds sing then you know it's true
There's never nothing nothing nothing to do
