[Verse 1]
I heard my teacher say that I’d be better off
If I just took what I’ve been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I’m told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Verse 2]
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob’s desk
But she never liked me
She said I’m gon’ fail, no matter what I give
She said ’cause my skin wasn’t light enough
Tuition wasn’t high enough
I couldn’t understand just what I did
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Bridge]
Just tell me how
You’re much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me
I’m still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life
