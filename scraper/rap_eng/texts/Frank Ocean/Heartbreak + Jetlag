[Intro]
Blue, heyeye, heyeyeye
Blue, heyeyeye, heyeyeyeyeye
Blue, oh oh oh, heyeye, heyeyeye

[Verse 1]
Never seen a cloud
Up close baby
Never left the ground
Before baby
Never fucked a hundred miles up
Never been in love

[Bridge]
But if I'd never met yo ass
I would never known how it feels to crash

[Hook]
We didn't land smooth, damn
It's heartbreak plus the jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Ohh ohh oh ahh

Ohh ohh oh ahh
Ohh ahh ha ohh
Ohh ohh oh ahh ahh

[Verse 2]
Just stay alone
This heart lonely
Waiting at the terminal, waiting oh oh oh
I watched everybody else get on
But deep down I'm scared to fly back home
Cause last time it went up and went down, down, down
In flames

[Bridge]
But if I'd never met yo ass
I would never known how it feels to crash

[Hook]
We didn't land smooth, damn
It's heartbreak plus the jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag
Ohh
