Verse 1:
When you’re winning what are you losing for it?
When you’re fighting what are you killing for it?
Are you killing for it?
Say you have dreams but are you living for it?
Are you growing or you’re just dying slowly
Are you dying slowly?

Chorus:
Cause the light would shine
Like a lamp upon your path
And nothing can stop it
(Clarity)
In the right time
You’d see, all that matters is right
Right here for ya

Verse 2:
When we’re losing, what are we gaining from it?
When we’re fighting, someone else suffers from it
Someone suffers from it
Say we have dreams but aren’t living for it?
So we growing or are we dying slowly
Are we dying slow?

Chorus:


Bridge/Verse3:
Why do I miss you if you’re still here?
Why do I leave if I still care?
Why do I give up on you baby?
(Why? Why…?)
Why do you leave me if you still care?
Why you in someone else’s own bed?
And girl I can’t lie…
Since you been in my bed
No girl has been here
And girl I can’t lie…
These things in my head beginning to feel a lot like regret
How was it easy for me to love you?
Yet! So so so so easy for you to move on
