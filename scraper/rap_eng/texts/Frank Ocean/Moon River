[Intro]
One, two

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday (Someday, day)
A dream maker (Maker, maker)
My heartbreaker (You heartbreaker)
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (The same, the same...)

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our ends

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends

[Outro]
Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me
