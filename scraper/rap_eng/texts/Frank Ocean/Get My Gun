I’m a classy nigga

I got a sledgehammer for your answer
Blowtorch from my cigarettes yea
You think that is an overreaction
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun

Anybody else want to negotiate?

In the beginning I was humble
I don’t give a fuck now
Any nigga say some shit
Automatic shutdown
A snap of my finger, I’ll snap your femur
I know I a proper cleanup service that will drop by and cleanup
Blood and brains in the drapes, get vacuumed and steamed up
I’m married to the mob forever, baby no pre-nup
I’m talking big shit, yea, don’t it sound good?
I call shots homie and I don’t even run the hood
Think I was put on, I ain’t even from no hood
Gangbanger don’t bang, my gun do the same thing
Look good in red or blue, I never could choose between
That’s really probably why I ain’t never joined a gang
I’m too fashion savvy, indecisive, plus I’m happy
Fuck jail and I’m allergic to them hot shells
Grew up in it, tell you bout it like a bronx tale
I got a bone to pick, big as an ox tail

I got a sledgehammer for your answer
Blowtorch from my cigarettes yea
You think that is an overreaction
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun

I’m so damn suave, yea so damn hood
I’m coroner west coast, god damn a nigga good
Got a gun ain't had to use it yet, knock knock on wood
If I pop this big shit, it’ll knock down redwoods
Wish a nigga would, no I don’t. wish he wouldn’t
‘Cause if he do his brains is goo, homie, jello puddin’
I’m no killer, no terminator
But if you push me, I’mma make a great impersonator
These niggas ain’t shit and ain’t never gonna be shit
I’m on a yacht in c carters call me seasick
Blondes and brunettes, I feed them sea dick
A nigga get popped, I ain’t see shit
Love will get you killed, I can’t show no remorse
You rappers look like food, Aqua Team Hunger Force
So bon appetite, I’ll pack a knife and a fork
A lot of rappers they eatin’, cali and New York

I got a sledgehammer for your answer
Blowtorch from my cigarettes yea
You think that is an overreaction
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun

No, no, don’t take your shirt off nigga we ain’ fighting
Wait till I get this mo’fuckin gun
Nigga I have fun in jail
I love the apple sauce they have in jail
It’s not that bad

Man I don’t even care no more
A nigga stay high wherever I go
Either off weed, them pills, or some blow
Looking for the party. where the bitches? let’s roll
I got my gun, my gun, if a nigga wanna start some shit
Mofucker don’t run, don’t run, cause I’mma kill you and your bitch

Whoa whoa wait a minute hold the phone
In no shape or form have I ever condoned
Killing somebody, him or his bitch
Unless he deserved it and she’s an ugly ass bitch
I’m crucial, yea so crucial
But so’s the whole world, best believe the feeling’s mutual
Dog eat dog in Kathmandu
Fuck it, I’m gonna eat like man vs food

Nigga I’m senseless
I’m outta control nigga
If I get this gun nigga and you hear heads pop off
I’m popping niggas
I’m popping babies
I’m popping bitches
I don’t care
I have no standards
Nigga I’m put a fucking nipple on the end of a silencer and put it in a baby’s mouth
