[Verse One]
I looked you in the eyes
I crossed my heart and hope to die
I will never let them cry
I held you in my arms
Said I won't let go until you feel you’re ready
'Til you feel you’re ready

Told me on the phone
Something bout you love me
Ooh baby say it to my face
I could have a place in your world
Kinda like your army, your air force, your peace corps

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow
Baby let me be the guide
Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Verse Two]
Oh, baby if you like
We can go to paradise
Be back by the next sunrise
And no, I won't stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit, not unless you with it

And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me
Well baby tell me how it feels
Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow
Baby let me be the guide
Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Bridge]
Left, right, switch it up
Oh, we gotta pick it up now, slow it down
Hell yeah, switch it up
No we just can't let it fall down
Gotta keep it that, that, that, that
I can never quite get enough
Gotta keep your back arched up
Follow the leader, baby girl
It's going down, down, down
Down down down

[Alternate Chorus]
Now move it right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
