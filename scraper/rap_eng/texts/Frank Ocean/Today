[Verse 1]
I won't fix my mouth to tell you that we won't make it
'Cos I'll never lie to you, no baby
I know we built our dreams of futures in the sand
Knowing they could wash away, but I don't care, oh oh

[Pre Chorus]
Yeah, 'cos if those dreams do fade
I know we're gonna dream again
Tomorrow

[Chorus]
We're only gonna live today
We're only gonna love today
So never be afraid again
Oh no, oh yeah
Come jump out of the plane with me
Let's parachute on love today
We're only gonna live today
Today, today

[Verse 2]
You said I got too much to lose now
That I should be careful now
Oh no, what for?
All of the flashing lights
They dim eventually
And I will live the life
As long as you take the risk with me, yeah

[Pre Chorus]
Yeah, 'cos if those dreams do fade
We're gonna dream again
(we're gonna dream again)
Tomorrow!

[Chorus]
We're only gonna live today
We're only gonna love today
So never be afraid again
Oh no, oh yeah
Come jump out of the plane with me
Let's parachute on love today
We're only gonna live today
Today, today, today

[Bridge]
Oh oh ooh
Live today, love today, oh yeah
Just take the chance now
You don't gotta think about it (don't think about it)
Let go of every fear about it (don't fear it love)
There's no way we can lose. (we can't lose)
Think about it, don't think about it
Think about it, baby

[Chorus]
We're only gonna live today
We're only gonna love today
(Ain't no way we can lose)
So never be afraid again
Oh no, oh yeah
(Don't think about it)
Come jump out of the plane with me
Let's parachute our love today
We're only gonna live today
Today, today
