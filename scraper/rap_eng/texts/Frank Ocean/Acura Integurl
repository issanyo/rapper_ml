[Verse 1]
She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
