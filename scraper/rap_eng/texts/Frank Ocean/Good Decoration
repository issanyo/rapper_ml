[Verse 1]
Take my picture
Don't forget to frame it
Cause you'll miss me when I'm gone
I'll bet ya
You're gonna wanna hang it on the wall
Next to the door I walked out of

[Pre-Chorus]
(What now?)
That's the perfect spot for our love
(What now?)
Right by the door I walked out of
(What now?)
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Pre-Chorus]
The colors of your walls are depressing
The photo of me will brighten your place
You know it outta go
Right by the door that I walked out of
That's the perfect spot for our love
Right by the door I walked out of
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Verse 2]
Now you can fall in love with a picture of me
But it's not real
It's make believe
It'll be true
It'll never love you back like did
Back then

Ya (x3)
