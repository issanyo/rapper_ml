[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up look up
You see the last line in the air
Reach out reach out
And try to catch one if you can
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor staring out my window
And seeing them right about to crash right into you
You marching on the sidewalk umbrella up
Oblivious no clouds shades on no sun
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
(Look up look up)
You better look all around
(All around)
You better
(Look up look up)
I know they're coming down
(Coming down)
They're coming down
(Look up look up)
You better look up
(Look up look up)
Crashing


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up
And maybe you'll see the lies
You'll see him fly
Look up Look up
You'll see the lies
Look up look up
