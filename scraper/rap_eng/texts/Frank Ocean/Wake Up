[Intro]
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

[Verse 1]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Outro]
It’s just a dream, that’s all our love is
It's just a dream
(It's just a dream)
(My love is in that bottle)
(Save, save me)
