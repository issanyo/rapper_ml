Go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Forbidden from the beginning
I saw her there (up there)
Been like that since I met her
They said I couldn't have her
Way out of my league
I never believed it
I gotta get her heart
I gotta make her mine

[Verse 2]
But what if she just tells me
I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bares hands
And crushes my ego
Dismiss me as a kid
Tell me I'm barely legal
But bareley legal

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 3]
This conversation is taking us for a loop
Taking you serious is difficult to do
Cause I don't believe ya
When you say that you don't
Ever look at me quite that way
You say that you trying to settle down
But you I'm handsome
I should be having fun
I shouldn't move fast

So I went faster
Cause it ain't no fun
Without ya

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no
