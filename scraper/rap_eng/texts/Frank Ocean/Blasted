[Verse 1]
She’s the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She’s thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 2]
Said you should get a rubix cube over your heart
But you say I’ve already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that’s what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Bridge]
Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she’s over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul
