[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could guess your password
You know I'd break in
To the empty heart
That you keep my face in
Deleted scenes where I took off my shirt back then
You couldn't take off work back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
I had a twin
Took out all the mids back then
Back then
No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

[Chorus]
I know that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with the flashlight
Had to admit, I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids at all
It's not the same
[?] is over
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
We could start again with nothing new
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All those things I didn't need to say
That I said to you
There were things you didn't need to say
That's okay too
Baby, I could dream all night, dream all night
I could dream all night, dream all night
Dream
