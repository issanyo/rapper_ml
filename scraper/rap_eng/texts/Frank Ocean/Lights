[Verse 1]
Donald Trump said buy an apartment with her (uh)
Buying an apartment with ya
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all

[Pre-Chorus]
They said you love that girl
You need that girl
But don’t you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who going solo baby?
I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

[Verse 2]
Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother, I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know it's right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she’s been grilling is me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won’t let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Bridge]
It’s strobing, baby, and they burning baby
But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it’s like dynamite
This love will keep us about 55 degrees
Don’t mind the lights
Don’t mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Outro]
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
