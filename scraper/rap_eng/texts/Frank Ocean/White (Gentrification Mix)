[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget

[Verse 2: Melo-X]

I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the TV station
