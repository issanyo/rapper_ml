[Verse 1]
My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two-thousand miles away

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 2]
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

[Bridge]
My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't
