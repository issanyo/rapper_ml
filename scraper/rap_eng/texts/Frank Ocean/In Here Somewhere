[Verse: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Tonight late at night sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need
It's been so long
Gotta find the one
Who'll hold you tight

[Outro: Lil Flip]
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight?
