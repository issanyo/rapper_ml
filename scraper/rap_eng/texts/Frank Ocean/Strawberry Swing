[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye

[Outro: Coldplay]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time

(Sound of alarm clock abruptly interrupting song.)
