[Intro]
Day in, day out
I'm high again, now I'm passed out
Wake up, go to sleep, eat something,
rinse and repeat

Escape the night, driving off in the lifting sunrise,
like a date after fights riding quick upon lies
Writing late afterthoughts of what's been coming
Music in the clouds is where I'll be runnin'
Say goodbye to the fun and the parties and more,
you should lay to the sun and open the door
Let your heart in quick is what I'm doing
Let the people know we'll all be booming

[Verse 1: "Left Brain"]
It's over now, she's gone from you. Stop tryin' to turn back
All the lies and tears you made her cry with the words you said?
What kind of man are you to make her turn her back on you?
The greatest thing in the world, and now she hates to see you
And now fast forward to where we are now. You're fucking up,
you're slowing down, she gave you one shot
Now with months after months, no longer you that she wants
So you try to write a bunch of stupid love songs to bring her in your touch
This time It's personal, you gave yourself the choice the to make the dream you want optional
Instead, you try and chase the only thing that has your heart
Or should I say "had",
because the one thing she took from you was your pride. You really think you can take that?
No...it's time to grow the fuck up and be a man

[Verse 2: "Right Brain"]
Snapping back into myself, I really lost my way
And now I must collect myself and get through all the pain
I really let her down, I really made her feel like shit, and I'm sorry
But how many times can one apologize for all the memories, was it worth it?
And to the point, was she worth it too?
If I had just kept my patience at heart,
would have played her the fool
It's time that I act my age and plan where I gotta go
'Cause now with God on my side, this is the strongest I ever wrote

[Outro]
You've been gone for so long now,
You've been flying overseas
But even then we know you've had enough
I think it's time that you grow up, yeah

When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
