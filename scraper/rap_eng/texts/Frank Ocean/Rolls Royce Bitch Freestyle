[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Who else?
I knew all this back on the Shaw
Back when I had no bedrooms at all
Now it's tears in a wraith feeling soft
Now I'm based like I'm lost at a rave
Really miss my landaulet
Look at the stars, it's a plane
This plane right here cost me bank
That Bentley truck ugly, I'm straight
It's straight, but that's just not my style
Just not my style
When Sage pushed it mongo
Way before the Uber
Was stranded as fuck at the house
We just landed we scuffing the ground
We been knew the earth was around
These goofies ain't looking for Mickey
They looking for mini me, copy my style
Copies is selling and I don't know why
Mostly I cockblock myself on the pop
400k I could spend it on lots
Can't pay for play Christmas day no Xbox
Last Christmas Day was in LA with Flack
Pourin' this red, sky gettin' blue
We couldn't tell if it's IMAX or not
Butterfly hinges on a cocoon

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh
