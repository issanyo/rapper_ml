[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk

[Pre-Hook]
And I'm hanging low, and I'm swinging far
Home, home

[Hook]
What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 2]
How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before

[Outro]
Who needs you?, Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say
You need a save, hey
