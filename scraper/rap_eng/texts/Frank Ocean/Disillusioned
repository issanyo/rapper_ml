[Verse 1]
Don't you see I'm here for ya'
All your best interest are on my heart
I just wanna grow wit'ya...
And never let the nature break us apart
The Well endowed took the earth and changed it
A thousand grapes in the middle never knew they wereâ€¦?
Never shared any knowlege for confirmation, of their relation...Ohh Hallelujah!
Disillusioned !

[Verse2]
Can't you feel a thing child?
Can't you tell she's feeling so used
Said you should make your mind up
Since you know how to feels to be abused
It wasn't... the concept of nation...
To divide the one consciousness
Young and wild, taking spaceships
.....
Searching for a path out of delusion
Disillusioned!
