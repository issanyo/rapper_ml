I saw you, Chinese birthday
With a strawberry icee
Channeling Morrissey
Were we at the rave, dancing horribly
Pulse went through my face and my clear backpack
Sonic sound you made me
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think i'm easy
Between the three of us
There's no one sleeping cold
Nobody said it would be easy

With you on my mind
I'm scared to think alone
Ohh why was it never this easy
The windows raise to show us
Daylight's come again
