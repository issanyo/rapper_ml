[Verse 1]
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

[Verse 2]
Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me

Ohh in love
