Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

[Outro]
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how I feel about bi-
