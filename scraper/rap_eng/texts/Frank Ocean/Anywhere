Oh, girl you blow my mind everytime that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bad, lil shorty ain't scared
We just do it anywhere..
In the backseat of my car, I know she don't mind
All up in your office, putting in that overtime
We just do it anywhere..
