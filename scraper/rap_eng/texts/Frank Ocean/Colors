"Hello?"
"Hey Six, What you up too?"
"(Sighs) Im just.."

Chorus:
Sittin' here in this orange room
Really trying not to feel green
Cuz if I end up turning blue
Imma fuck up this whole thing

V1:
Oh great, it's too late, there's no escape
Said I like what we have but I always debate
Cuz I stay analyzing' to see if you relate
Constantly tossing the thought if this is 'Fake or Fate'?
So I won't bring it up
Cuz i know deep down you don't give a fuck
You're a free spirit, my hippie, i know whats up
You're a free spirit, my hippie, i know whats up
So cuffing's really not an option
Told me "Don't catch feelings", i've forgotten
But how can you blame me for you being poppin'?
Fuck around and make me spoil you rotten
Shit really ain't fair
But you been through more, so I wouldn't dare
Try to be some extra stress in your hair
Or some extra shit you just hate to compare
I retract everything I say to you
Can you sit here and say I look OK to you?
If you say yes, I think its for the best
That I create a barricaded space from you
Cuz you don't know me like I thought you did
Im a grown ass woman, not some fucking kid
& don't sit here & say you grown
Just cuz you got a job and living on your own
You don't ever settle, all you do is roam
To whoever gives you money or some dome
All you care about is attention
Im real rude if i forgot to mention

But for some reason I got a soft spot
Cuz you cool me down whenever Im hot
Im hope you keepin' up, because i won't stop
I'll smash through it if there is a roadblock and
Dive off a cliff in the name of love
I know I'm good, Ima fly up above
Unless I dive down in a dark abyss
Where hate is alive & never missed
You got me talking crazy shit
Going on and on, Im full of it
But this is me, all of me, not just a bit
You won't let me show you love unless its from the lips?
Tell me what type of shit is this?
But its my fault for being so lenient
As much as it tears me apart, she got my heart
Making it so damn convenient

Chorus:
Sittin' here in this Orange room
Really trying not to feel Green
Cuz if I end up turning Blue
Imma fuck up the whole thing 2x

Babygirl
You becoming my world
& if i could give you anything
It'd be way more than some fucking ring
I love we got so much common
& i really love it when we vibin'
Smokin' & Drinkin'
I love when you tell me what you thinkin'
Give me a taste of yo' mind
Or just give me a bit of yo' time
But i know i can't have it all
Cuz in the end your girl would be so appalled
So that's it, Im gone...
