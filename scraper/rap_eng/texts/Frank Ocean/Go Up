[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm hitchhiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Verse 2]
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or something
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity's calling my phone, I can't answer
Ain't no service way up here girl
We're twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me what
Show me what
Show me what
