[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower, my aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Barefeet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

[Outro: Frank Ocean, Sampha + Jazmine Sullivan]
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?
