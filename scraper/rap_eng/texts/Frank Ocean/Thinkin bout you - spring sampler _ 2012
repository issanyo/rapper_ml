A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh)]

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh)]

Yes, of course I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? [(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever [(ooh)]
