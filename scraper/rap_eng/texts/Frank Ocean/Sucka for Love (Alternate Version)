[Verse 1]
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage, just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, she grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me shy and wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you been searching too long
You knew that it was over, wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Verse 2]
Summer lovin' in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you been searching to long
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Bridge]
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh, love, we did for we did it for love, love, love

[Outro]
See baby looking so long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love

Been searching too long
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
