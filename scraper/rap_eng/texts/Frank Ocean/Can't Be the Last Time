[Verse 1]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Bridge]
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time
