[Intro]
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Cause I got a little style goin'
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if, they're, just like you

[Chorus]
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever...
