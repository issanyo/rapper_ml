[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh what a day I chose for you
To tell you that I loved you
You know you sounded like knuckles that never cracked
Maybe I should yield to you
Maybe I should yield to him
I'm 27, something's gotta give

[Chorus]
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down

[Verse 2]
Rather than lie to you
Rather than lie to you
Everything you say to me sounds just like that

[Chorus]
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down

[Verse 3]
I'm dealing with a wave crash
I'm dealing with a wave crash
Everything you say to me sounds just like that
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
There are two men down
