[Intro: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain’t likely

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain’t likely

[Pre-Verse: Skinnie Trill & Frank Ocean]
Me imagino contigo all the rolling
Having sex on the road encima de un Cadillac
(These bitches want Nikes)
You got the vision that
Nobody has over heeeeeeeere

[Verse 1: Skinnie Trill & Frank Ocean]
(These bitches want Nikes)
Shawty, we're goin' where nobody goes
(These bitches want Nikes)
Turn up the music it's under control
(These bitches want Nikes)
Me mira y pisa mi acelerador

[Verse 2: Skinnie Trill]
Highway, highway
Rolling in Caddy on this highway
Highway, highway
And you next to me

Highway, highway
Rolling in Caddy on this highway
Highway, highway
And you next to me
And you next to me

She's trying to know me (yeah!)
She wanna' be my reina. (trill!)
A 100 por la highway
Abre la ventana y grita:
¡Nadie nos oye!

She's trying to know me
She wanna' be my reina
A 100 por la highway...

[Pre-Chorus: Skinnie Trill & Frank Ocean]
You got the vision that
Nobody has over heeeere
(These bitches want nikes)
You got the vision that
Nobody has over heeeere

(Heeeeeeeere)
Heeeeeeeeeeeere)

[Chorus: Skinnie Trill]
Shawty, we're goin' where nobody goes
Turn up the music it's under control
Shawty, we're goin' where nobody goes
Turn up the music is under controoooooool

(Highway)
