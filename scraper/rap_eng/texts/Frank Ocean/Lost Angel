[Verse 1]
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

(No I don't wanna)
(And then the kid came)

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Bridge]
Oh Angel, tell me what am I to do?
Angel, I can't find another you
Angel search downtown, now I'm on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna' get to you
Exit La Cienega, I'm looking, I'm searching
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
