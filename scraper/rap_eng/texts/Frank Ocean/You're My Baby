[Verse 1]
She saying bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
I'm like who knew, who knew, who knew
After all these years I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too?
When I met you, you were
Chris Brown, Beyonc√© and Kells too, Kells too
When you met me I was
T.I., BG, Juve, Outkast and UGK
But we're both long way from home
Got the windows down, radio on
I wrote a letter to the sky, saying maybe one day you can kiss me, kiss me
My girl found it in the car, saying baby why you tryna diss me? Diss me

[Chorus]
You knew you're my baby, you knew you're my baby, yeah
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
Cause you knew you're my baby
