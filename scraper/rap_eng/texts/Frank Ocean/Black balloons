I woke up this morning feeling numb, the world is nothing without you
I know that I can't be stuck in this moment forever

People tell me to move on with my life
But what's it like to be stuck in a moment forever
Your memory still haunts my dreams

I woke up this morning with my head spinning round and round
Oh god please tell me this isn't what I think it is

I held my hand to the sky trying to reach up to god
I'm trying to look for a sign to move on with my life

What was once a heart that was full of cheers, is now a heart that is in total darkness

How could you tell me to move on with my life, when i'm stuck in a moment
I'm stuck in a moment and I feel like I'm frozen in time
I'm frozen in time
I i feel nothing, I feel nothing at all
