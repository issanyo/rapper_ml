currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted, but the truth is you’re a mixed crowd. so i’ll spare the details… for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. i’d like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i don’t have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful? besides, i’m not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i’ll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i’m used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ‘ledge’. what do you think of this guy?
