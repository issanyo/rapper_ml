[Intro / Verse 1]
We missed the light show
(That's what I call the weather)
Missed it like a three, a three
You and me and
I'm so sorry
I meant to lift the blinds some
So the sun could show off on us
It kind of slips my mind
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea

[Verse 2]
See my reflection on your chanel
(vintage)
I just got those for you
(tight)
I put em on you
(haha)
If you want baby
I'd go and lift the blinds some
So the sun could have a look at ya
But I see you just fine
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

[Bridge]
Now just right
Round my head too
Keep em on
When we going
Going strong
Got the red ones
With the polarized tint on em
Oh

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea
