MORNING

(Verse 1)
Now everybody wanna be somebody
Everybody is a fucking poser
Man I rather be a fucking dick
Than going around being a fucking choker
Life is a bitch with low self-esteem
Who dream about being a motherfucking queen
I don't care about school like I use to
A message to the teens, fuck what you do
One who's ready to battle. The meaning of my middle name
You niggas fags with a motherfucking Skittle brain
Need to graduate a start a new chapter
Skinny bastard want his dream to come faster
All that matters is music and fam
Look back at the shit that happened like damn
Nigga got picked on, I'm such a puss
I let people make fun of me, I'm such a wuss

(Verse 2)
Step into the time machine
Save Aaliyah's life
People would fuck with me everyday and every night
No such thing as a machine that goes back
Life is so golden like the grill on Kodak
Free Kodak RIP Fredo
Why this month gotta be this way though?
Tatted up add it up I got two now
I'm not desperate but shit, I need a boo now
Aquarius season you fucking bitch
A nigga wanna fuck but you stay ducking bitch
What I gotta do to make you smile?
What I gotta do to make you wild?
What I gotta do to make you blush?
If you got somebody, I'll be crushed
Why you pulling on my shirt, girl?
You like the R. Kelly song, you a flirt girl

(Outro)
Yeah
Deezy Martians
Fear The Unknown
Fear The Nobodies
Fear The Unpopular
Marzi Gang dumb bitch
To anybody who wanna be the next big thing
Always believe yourself and don't NOBODY
No motherfucking body tell you
"you're wack, you're trash"
Cause one day, you'll make it
And they'll be sorry

(IMMATURE)

(Instrumental)

(EVERYTHING)

You were my everything, girl (8x)
