[Verse 1]
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart, man
I can't ask my girl

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

[Verse 2]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
'Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?
