Listening to star trek, star tracks
On the track, starting back only after we get to the end
Parts and planets, feeling small
All the matches floating off
Help me breathe in out here tonight
Nothing new, nothing old, baby girl
But you look good in a space suit
I can’t keep my hands off you
Plus, it’s easy to love you up here, up here

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love

The candle’s burning in the sun
We don’t need them but you lie, girl
They glow, they glow
Oh yeah, we were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful
You look good in a space suit
I can’t keep my hands off you
‘Cause it’s easy to love you up here, up here

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love

We could make believe that we’re up there
But we’re only in the backseat of this secret, so
If the lights go by that means the cops flew by
But they won’t bother us
No, no, no, no

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
