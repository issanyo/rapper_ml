[Intro]
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
I built this city

[Verse 1]
I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Verse 2]
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Bridge]
We used to be sky high
We used to be major
We used to be sky high
We used to be major, baby, major

[Outro]
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city mine, baby
This whole city is mine
The city is mine, honey
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city is mine, oh baby
The city is mine
The city is mine
Now give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more
