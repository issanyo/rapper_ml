Versace Versace I'll play the piano I'm not Liberace
You could stay seated I'm taking that Grammy your music is sloppy
Niggas is heated they keep on repeating the evening in slow-mo
I sold enough records I'm selling out cities, I don't do no promo
Marina Abramovic Riccardo Tisci Madonna Beyonce
And Donatella if you don't believe me believe what the blogs say
We was all at the table, it was a debate then we came in agreement
That twitter ain't relevant anyway really, I'm finna delete it
My Instagram all over internet anyway, don't think I need it
SKRRRR
Got bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
On bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
I'm running that Porsche for the winter
If you trying to follow the leader
I need a sabbatical do an apprenticeship under Domingo
Study Carreras and Luci, I ain't finna rush out a single
I get it when artists go loopy and lose it and get into opiates
Like when you get all that you wanted and that shit is not what you hoped it was
You had you a formula, one hit the wall now you Ayrton Senna
You had you a lady, then she hurt your ego, now you can't forgive her
Yea
I'm wearing some Dickies they cost 30 Euro
I'm not even into Versace
