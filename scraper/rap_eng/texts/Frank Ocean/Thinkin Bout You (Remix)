[Intro: Justin Bieber]
JB, Jaden Smith, let's go

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes donâ€™t shed tears, girl, they bawl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Got me thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I be thinking 'bout you, and you know I do
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl, so are you
Man I heard some things but I don't know what's true
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you, but a man will show it
That's why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But let's just have some fun girl, as long as you're here
Cause when you get up on that plane, you'll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, it's wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared? Cause that's what they say
And everyday that I don't see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking I'm crazy
But they don't know that I think about you daily cause I be

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Baby I could pick you up in the Rolls Royce
Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
Every time that I'm away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that'll never stop
They say it's true love, well is love true?
Yeah I think it's love, that's why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I don't think you are so fly
And I know why ain't no guy gon' treat you like I
Wanna, gonna be the man that treats you right, be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right, let's go into the night

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
