[Verse 1]
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard and lay you right on the grass

[Hook]
Give it to you over again, over again
Over again, over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally

[Verse 2]
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed (Wow)
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you

[Hook]
Give it you over again, over again
Over again, over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally

[Bridge]
My cavewoman, I'm a caveman
Doing wild things in a wild land
We keep going baby, we keep getting it baby
We'll get pebbles maybe a couple bam bams
Bam bam, bang bang, girl your heart
Goes bam and bang, feel my heart go, go, go

[Outro]
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!
Do what youâ€“ [cassette ejected]
