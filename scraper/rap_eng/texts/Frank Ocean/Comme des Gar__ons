[Verse]
He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs
When he's lit he show 'em
Kept it faded on the side
We were seeing someone
We was dating on the side
He was seeing double
I was spinning hula
We were spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feelin' like a power tool
Finna move a nigga out his momma house now
That's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Would that diamond shine for real?
Shine for real

[Bridge]
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go

[Chorus]
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des
