[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, love, love, love
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Hollywood, Hollywood
Heard you like to take the love
Thatâ€™s why I came to town
With only my brain
Holly baby
Baby, yeah, baby, yeah
Why do you drive the talent crazy, crazy
Yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya'
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home
Yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood, oh

[Verse 2]
I met you on the TV screen
You told me you were single, and
We talked about the weather babe
You said it never rains in southern Cali
Baby, baby
Why do you drive the talent crazy
Yeah, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home, yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood
Oh yeah
