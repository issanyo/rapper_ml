Steely walks up to the parking structure of the corporate campus where Garten's car is located. Florence is manning the security desk. Looks on at Steely knowingly. This is one of Florence's gigs.

     Florence: 'C'mon.'
     Florence: 'Don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of child.'
     Florence: 'Gimme.' (Pointing at the bulge in his pocket.)

Walks past security into the empty underworld of parking levels—few overnighted vehicles here and there. He goes to where he left Garten's car and gets in. He pulls out a box of smokes and reads the warning label. He smokes a cigarette and begins looking at his teeth in the mirror. Garten's keys are inside as before. He starts the car. He drives normally, calmly, making his way off the corporate campus onto the highway, and getting off at an exit leading to a neighborhood nestled by woods. There is a subdivision ahead of him comprised mostly of high-rises. There's a lake passed.
