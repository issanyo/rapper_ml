How many cars on the drive are actually yours?
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors
You got a big big mouth, a big big house
You're the king of cribs right now

A real big hit, no hard shit
I swear that won't change me one bit
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

The world will still go on without you
The newspapers still talk about you
And if your ever low, pick up the phone
I'll be 'round, don't tell a soul

Cause I'm not you, you're bullet proof
I'm in a crowd and I can't move
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Let me in, let me in
Gimme the sunshine all year 'round
Lemme out, lemme out
Gimme it now, hear me out, hear me shout

Gimme the munchies , show me around
Lemme out, lemme out, gimme the reason
Gimme it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta big big house, big big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
That's not helping me right now

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
