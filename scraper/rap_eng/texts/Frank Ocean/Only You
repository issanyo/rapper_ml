[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
So I had a phone call
From a new man
In my home
He was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
He wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in his soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my new man
Was in my arms
In my home
He was loving me
69 times
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
