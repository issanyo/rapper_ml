Sid: This is my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Felt the morning sun and knew that
This was my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Even got a kiss from you
I feel like hoppin' up and down
Like a kangaroo
Jumpin' fences, climbin' trees
What pleases me is what I'll do, 'cause

[Chorus]
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year!
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we're jumping fences
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we lose our senses!

Look at Charlie up a tree
Kissin' Katie's ear
Charlie's wife is mad as hell!

[Chorus]

Oh well it happens once a year
And this is that once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year!

Look at Papa Halterbush
92 today
Running off with Sadie Lee

[Chorus]

He's heading for that pile of hay
'Cause this is his once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year!
