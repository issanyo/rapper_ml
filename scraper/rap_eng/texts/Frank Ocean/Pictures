I stack these magazines in the corner
(after I'm done with them)
And I still got the same hopes that I started with
(that you'd be in one of them)
My camera has shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But the memories fade baby
What am I gonna show to my kids girl?
When I'm older and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss our thing, miss our thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss you so bad
Miss you this bad, miss you so bad, miss you so

We didn't make love we celebrated it's invention
Confetti on the mattress I used to have those images
Tonight I came home, they were just embers in the fire
With my hard drive, almost no goodbyes

How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But the memories fade baby
What am I gonna show to my kids girl?
When I'm older and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss our thing, miss our thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss you so bad
Miss you this bad, miss you so bad, miss you so

No video, no polaroid
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles in my picture frames, no
Just got them little basic ones that the picture frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss our thing, miss our thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause' I didn't wanna miss you so bad
Miss you this bad, miss you so bad, miss you so
