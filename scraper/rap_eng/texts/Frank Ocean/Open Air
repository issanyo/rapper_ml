[Verse 1]
I had my feet in the water
And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Bridge]
Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that’s inside of my heart, baby
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won’t go back again
It’s better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher and higher
Don’t ever go under no more

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
