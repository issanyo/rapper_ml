[Verse]
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Donâ€™t have much longer baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me, they long to be close to you)
