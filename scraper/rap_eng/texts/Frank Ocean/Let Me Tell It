[Chorus]
I see you with your hatin' ass
Major league with the bandz
Why you actin' like you know me?
Your girl would probably leave you for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me

[Verse 1: Tellaman]
All my jitaz ridin' with me..
I promise they will never catch us slippin'
Script is the only thing I stick to, not a bitch yeah
There ain't no fuckin' love in these streets yeah
I'm all about cheese cake
I don't ask for it, I take it
Girl if we're not related, then you better start gettin' naked
Didn't get it right on the first, but I know a lot is at stake
So I keep going no break
These bitches doin' whatever it takes
To see me back in the dirt
Fuck the world until that bitch squirt
I got drive but I keep it covert
Cause all these mother suckers wanna see me hurt

[Chorus]
I see you with your hatin' ass
Major league with the bandz
Why you actin' like you know me?
Your girl would probably leave you for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me

[Verse 2: Frank Casino]
See I'm not the type you can probably judge from it's cover
I'm not here for the camera shows, that fake love
Like we all brothers, like we all started moving up together
Flock ofbirds of different feathers, find leisures off different pleasures
My risk is off a different measure, on a different pedestal..
All my shit is really real, ball on a different type of field
Gorge Foreman with grill, i'm really poppin' no pills..
HBA I been trill, envelops that won't seal..
I'm on ice really chilled, like, "Woah woah Frankie chill"
Yeah yeah it look like we don't play fair..
Zero fucks bout any side, only here for my welfare
Everything is all truth, command me or don't dare
Man I'm good in every city, you'd almost swear I belong there Fuck outta here

[Hook: Tellaman]
I see you with your hatin' ass
Major league with the bandz
Why you actin' like you know me?
Your girl would probably leave you for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
They don't know my story
But they wanna tell it for me


[Verse 3: Erick Rush]
They don't know my story
But fuck it I ain't got no worries
All this sauce will probably get me deported
All this winning it get me rewarded
They tell me I'm blunt
You might just get you a buzz
You must ain't know what's up
They must have told you that that boy there is the one
"How does he hustle so early in the morning"
Nigga I do this
I jump on the track and (?)
I hop in the booth and lay dookies
I don't know what else I'm gonna do with it
I'm a fool with it, yeah I'm smooth with it
You said you got it but who you kidding
You're not in line you're a loose kitten
Your two cents is worth two pennies
Like hey, Just give me two minutes
The illest flow I've got the flu with me
From pullin'up you know the crews with me
Them niggas don't know what to do with me
Like whoo! They never knew!
They ain't ready for this shit Imma do
Niggas can barely keep up with the moves
They just be staring and hoping I lose

[Outro]
I see you with your hatin' ass
