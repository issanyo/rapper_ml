[Verse 1]
Look up, look up, look up
You’ll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Verse 2]
Feels like I’m on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You’re marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see ‘em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Bridge]
Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They’re coming down, coming down
They’re coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Outro]
Look up, look up
And baby you’ll see the light
You’ll see him flying
Look up, look up
You’ll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground
