Frank ocean verse:

You work hard all ya life/but i guess beauty school couldn't come easy/work all night/studing for an exam/i hop you do a swing bop well/stay so semetrical/i hope you do a real job well/cause i know it gets old waiting tables for peoples


Damienn Jones verse

Cloaking in ten minutes/we short on the floor/mind grains starting/customers approaching the door/ain't off till a couple of days/ a quarter a century/looking for a hero spent 3 dollars and  didn't win a lottery/im hopeless with a penny and a hole in it/alone in my feelings/love in a toilet/unhappy ever after ending/single status pending rather be alone then be around pretending



Frank ocean verse:

You work hard all ya life/but i guess beauty school couldn't come easy/work all night/studing for an exam/i hop you do a swing bop well/stay so semetrical/i hope you do a real job well/cause i know it gets old waiting tables for peoples


Damienn jones verse


Wishing i had a significant other to complete me/cross my eyes dot my t's/a message to the sea/cinderella had a pair of jordans and a swagger/swing batta-batta-batta/come save me get me cuff me who ever you be/we can commercialized like the cosby's/come save me get me cuff me who ever you be/we can commercialized like the cosby's/
