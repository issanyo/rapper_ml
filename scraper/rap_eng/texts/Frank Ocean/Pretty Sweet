[Intro]
Now, to the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

[Verse]
What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside, I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah

[Outro]
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucka
Pretty sweet, pretty sweet
