[Verse 1:]
I hear the rain drops
Fall on my rag top
And come down the windshield of my car
Parked on the same lane
We came to get away
And trade our kisses after dark

[Pre Chorus:]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
So locked in love
And I gotta get free

[Verse 2:]
I feel the clouds start to form
In my mind but
Rain starts to pour then blurs my eyes
Maybe there's one whose heart is worth more
To you than the one you left behind
By throwing my quarters out
Into the water I wish that you'd meet me here
Like you use to
A heart in a mind we shared
How could you take your half
I don't know but it would never be the same

[Pre Chorus:]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
So locked in love
And I gotta get free Ohhhh

[Bridge:]
My baby's gone
The vault is closed
My heart is cold
And still all alone
Sometimes I hear my
My own heart beating, beating, beating
Against the wall

[Chorus]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
So locked in love
And I gotta get free

[Chorus]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
So locked in love
And I gotta get free

[Outro]
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free
