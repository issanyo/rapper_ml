[Verse 1]
I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said "don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said "don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste of

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Ohh, whore, ohh, whore, ohh, whore
Ohh, whore, ohh whore, whore, whore, whore
Ohh, whore, ohh, whore, ohh, whore
Ohh, whore, ohh whore, whore, whore, whore
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
Can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
Can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her
Novacane, novacane-cane
