[Verse 1]
Her state of mind is constantly changing
To hell and back
She drives, switching lanes
Not knowing what she has til she knows where she's going
If she can just get past this traffic
She tries and tries to find peace of mind
But these days everything's in your face
So she stays soul and in her mind
Blowin' smoke in the sky
Cause it's her only vice
I wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck (x4), no
She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck (x4), no

[Verse 2]
Some people see the way she needs changing
They don't know the struggles that she was raised with
So shut the fuck up
Just shut the fuck up
Stop thinking that you know everything
You don't and you never will, so just let it go
And be free as long as you're kind and and you've been born with the fight
So don't wonder why

[Hook]
