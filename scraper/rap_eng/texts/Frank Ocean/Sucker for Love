[Verse 1]
I seen him buy you a drink
I start kissing ,holding hands
While you're looking at me (at me)
I hope that he don't think that he is the only man
That you getting freaky with (freaky with)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Why try to cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker
Try to cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for you

[Verse 2]
Her body's fierce, she's like scorpion
Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man
I can't lie, I still would hit it
But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for ya

[Bridge]
One day you gonna stop and you gonna get caught
Whether you like it or not
You ain't gone get far, one day you gonna fall in love
And someone's gonna break your heart

[Chorus]
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker
Tryna cuff her, cuff her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
Sucker for love, sucker for love, sucker for love, for love, for love
And I'm sorry for ya
