[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Verse 2]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

[Bridge]
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you, I love you
