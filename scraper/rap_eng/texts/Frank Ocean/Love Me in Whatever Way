[Intro]
Where the rose water passes and dry river flows
Where the rose water passes and dry river flows

[Verse 1]
Where you lead me I will go
Where the rose water passes and dry river flows
And if that's the way this year
Itâ€™s the thorns I want and the bloom I always fear
Tell me where I have to go
And then love me there
Tell me when I have to go
And then love me there

[Interlude]
I won't be so loud if this is what you need
I won't be so loud if you won't take my lead
I know some men hurt more than me
But giving up is hard to do
But giving up is hard to do

[Verse 2]
This is a lonely off-white room
I keep my gaze on you, while other people move
Where you lead me I will go
Guess the thorns are on
And the bloom I always fear
Tell me when I have to go
And then love me there
Tell me when I have to go
And then love me there

[Chorus]
Love me in whatever way
Love me in whatever way
Love me in whatever way
Love me in whatever way
Love me in whatever way
Love me in whatever way
Love
Oh, ah

[Verse 3]
This is a lonely off-white room
I keep my gaze on you, while other people move
Where you lead me I will go
Where the rose water passes and dry river flows

[Chorus]
Love me in whatever way (I can't give up, not now, not then)
Love me in whatever way (I can't give up, not now, not then)
Love me in whatever way (Not then, I can't go)
Love me in whatever way (Not now, not then)
Love me in whatever way (I can't give up, not now, not then)
Love me in whatever way
I can't give up, not now, not then, not then
Not then
