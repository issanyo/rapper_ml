Verse:

Memo finna start acting out if I don't see her soon, yeah my best friend ain't backing out it's still on sight fool
Only one out here on the night loops, I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light body need a race stripe, and these minerals on my body break light
These reds on my body brake light, new man coming up ahead on his own two
You a natural blondie like Goku, sleeping on my belly in a loop like a serpent, talking Heads rippling on the surface eyes low chin heavy

Chorus:

Feelings you provide feelings you provide, I know I know
Feelings, I
Feelings you provide feelings you provide, I know
Feelings, I
