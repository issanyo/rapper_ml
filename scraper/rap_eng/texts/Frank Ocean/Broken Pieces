[Verse 1]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now were grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Use to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier
