(Intro)
Alright
Shout out Daunte
Shout out Rose
Shout out Josh
Shitt
I like it
I likee it

(Verse)
First I gotta thank my mom for always raising me right
Now that fame is in sight
They can say my name with great pride
And I'm fucking grateful in spite
Of my dad saying goodbye
It's all good
I just know that everything was a lie
But I'm not tripping
My only goal was be Scott Pippen
Cause Jordan was godgiven
I'm not blessed
And this ain't a contest
But I'm caught winning
A blonde mess
Who brought sinning to all women
I confess
That I fuck bitches
That I don't know
That I don't have to call
I just see them at a show
Then in the bathroom stall
Greatest rapper alive
That's in my own mind
But I'm waiting for the day
That I can;t rap at
Off adderall
My eyes low
Blowing dro while I drive slow
Lights low
Iso
Time to let my life show
I'm so high right now
That I could die right now
And I'd be satisfied
Been trynna figure out
Why we're all alive
I'm starting to think there isn't a reason why
Maybe we live to die
Or maybe I'm not the person to ask
I'm not perfect
I've been cursed
And I find my verse in the flask
I'm first or I'm last
Least I'm not as scared as before
I guess that I don't care anymore
