[Verse 1]
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he’s gone
Cause when we’re together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it’s like
Whenever it’s just me and you
You know I don’t wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Bridge]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave

[Verse 3]
Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It’s just gon’ happen
I don’t understand it
My heart’s sane
But my mind’s going crazy

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Outro]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave

Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay
