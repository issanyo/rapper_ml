[Part I: Close To You]

I’ll be honest
I wasn’t devastated
But you could’ve
Held my hands through it baby
Let my mind
Run underneath warms jets, jet-jets

I run my hands through what’s left
But we’re getting older baby
Don’t have much longer baby

Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
But just like mine
Versions of these belong to you
And after a while
They're keeping me close to you

[Part II:  Never Can Say]

And that is why
I never can say goodbye, oh no no I
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
You say "Turn around you fool
You know I love you more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, no no no no no I
Never can say goodbye, ooh yeah yes
I never can say goodbye, no no no
I never can say goodbye, no
No no no no no
Never can, never, never can say, nev-nev-never can say
Never can say goodbye
No
