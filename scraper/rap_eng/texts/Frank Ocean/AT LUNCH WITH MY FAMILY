My aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn’t think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind. I’ve never been to africa but i know it’s a big place.. so my answer wasn’t really specific. It probably wasn’t even honest. I don’t know. I’m starting to think america’s fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there’s good reason. honestly, i just live here. i’m an american, sure, but it’s not really a choice i made for myself. if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it’s chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i’d stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here

Granted, i’ll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don’t?
