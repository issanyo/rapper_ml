[Verse 1]
I fall on my knees and pray
For heaven to show me the answer
Make me complete today
Soul, heart, body, and mind
If I could ask for just one more thing
Send to me the perfect lover
And I, Wouldn’t want for anything
I’ll be happy in time, my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Verse 2]
I hold out my hand
And pledge never to sell myself short
I’m vow to hold my head up
And i’m gonna keep it high
And I go out into the world wondering
If I make it too hard to find someone
To love me for me no more wasting my time
My heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who’s gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who’s gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
