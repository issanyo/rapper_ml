[Intro: John Legend]
Oh news said it
Oh yea

[Verse 1: John Legend]
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby
Did you know

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country warring
Leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower, baby
No where to go, oh I

[Chorus: John Legend]
I know we just met but baby
Could you love me quickly? Quickly!
I, want you to love me like you know
The world's about to end baby, Quickly!

[Verse 2: Brandy (John Legend)]
You said you didn't even know my name, but
Told me that we might as well make ours the same
What do you think baby? (no time)
Vegas might as well be light years away, oh
We just better land on the stars
Before they come crashing down
Cause I heard the news said

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy (John Legend)]
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country warring
Leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower, baby
No where to go, oh I

[Chorus: John Legend (Brandy)]
I know we just met but baby
Could u love me quickly? Quickly!
I, want you to love me like you know
The world is about to end baby, Quickly!

[Bridge: John Legend (Brandy)]
Yea that's right baby
Kiss me like the world is quaking
Do it like the earth is shaking
You got it baby, (You got it baby)
That's right lovely
Fill me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on life

[Chorus: John Legend (Brandy)]
I know we just met (just met)
But could u love me quickly? Quickly!
(Hurry up and love me)
I, want you to love me like you know
(the world's about to end baby, Quickly!
Whoa oh)
You barely know me baby
(But you gotta love me quickly, quickly, oh yea)

[Outro: John Legend (Brandy)]
Oh you gotta love me oh love me
(oh you gotta love me, gotta love me right now), oh oh yea, (yea)like the world's about to end baby
Love me (quickly now)
The news said the sky is falling
Quickly now, (Love me)
Love me
