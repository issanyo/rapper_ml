[Intro]
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down
Like a see saw let you down
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Bridge]
Remember those stroll down street? (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (like yesterday)
They shine on me (we were little then)
In class daydreamed about you (my baby)
(Just remember you) wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah
