[Verse 3: Lil I.D]
Hey Andy, I tracked your Instagram
And I found pictures of your gram
And found pictures of your grandma
Hey Andy, what’s your mood?
Hey Andy, I’m gonna lock and load
Ooh, Andy Kunz
Andy Kunz, what’s the deuce?
Ooh, Andy K, aye
Aye Andy, you transgender baby
No wonder you have no luck of being a lady (Ah!)
Hey Andy, you are trashy
Hey Andy, wooh!
Hey Andy, you belong in the trash
You a rat boy
You’re just like bold and brash, boy!
