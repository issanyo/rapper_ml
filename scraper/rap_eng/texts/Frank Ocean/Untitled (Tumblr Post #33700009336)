NO BETTER THAN THE NEXT MAN, JUST DOING A DIFFERENT THING WITH MY TIME. GOT TO. I WANNA WRITE A NOVEL ABOUT TWINS, SOME TYPE OF NATURE VERSUS NURTURE TALE.. I'VE SAID THAT TO A NEIGHBOR BEFORE. IT'S AN OPEN ENDED IDEA. I WANT TO START A CAR CLUB. I'm PLAYING WITH TWO NAMES FOR IT. I SKETCHED A LOGO FOR IT. IT'S NOT THERE YET. I WAS GOING TO BUILD AN ARCADE. THE MORE I LIVED WITH THAT IDEA.. THE LESS IT STUCK. IT'S MORPHING. SORT OF LIKE MY POTENTIAL RELOCATION TO NYC OR TOKYO OR SOME PLACE VERY FAR FROM THE COASTS OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS FALLING FOR SOMEONE NEW, IF I ALREADY HADN'T. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME. IT CAME AND WENT AND MAIMED US A LITTLE. NOT MUCH. I'VE POSSIBLY LOST ALL RELIGION, I'VE SUNKEN INTO PASSIVITY IN CERTAIN AREAS OF MY LIFE.. ALL WHILE BEING THE HONEST OPPOSITE IN OTHERS. THE NUMBER ONE RULE IN RELATIONSHIPS, FROM WHAT I HEAR, IS TO NEVER JUST LEAVE. I FLEW AROUND THE WORLD IN 2012. HAD A SPECIAL TIME. I HAD BRUNCH AT THE ROOFTOP RESTAURANT FROM 'LOST IN TRANSLATION'. LIKE 9 TIMES. I FOUND ABSOLUTE SILENCE IN A MEDITATION SESSION IN THAT HOUSE IN THE HILLS. I HAVE A DOG WHO MISSES ME. HE'S SO BIG NOW. DAMN. HE KNOWS ABOUT AS MUCH AS ME, AS TO WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I HAVE TO WRITE A SONG FOR SOMEONE NOW BECAUSE THEY PAID FOR MY TICKET AND MY HOTEL, AND I LET THEM. OH, I EAT STEAKS AGAIN NOW. IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS. ALL I REALLY HAVE TO SAY IS THAT LOVE IS ALL THERE IS. EVERY OTHER SENTENCE JUST BELABORS THE POINT. MAYBE NOT IN A BORING WAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'm SAYING. I SAT IN THE STUDIO DAYS AGO WITH JIGGAMAN AND PHARRELL. PHARRELL LOOKS 19. THEY SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS. I WONDER HOW MANY TROPHIES ARE LODGED IN THEIR MINDS. I WONDER WHY THEY STILL BUILD. I BUILD THINGS FOR THE SPORT AND THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. FOR IMMORTALITY BIIIITCH. I SAY IMMORTALITY IN JEST, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW ONE THING FOR CERTAIN. HOLY FUCK, I DON'T WANNA WRITE ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. IT'S HARD TO ASCERTAIN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHAT GOING THROUGH THINGS FEELS LIKE. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUTH. I CAN'T IMAGINE A DECADE FROM NOW. HOW I'LL FEEL ABOUT IT ALL. OREOS DON'T WORK WITH ALMOND MILK LIKE REGULAR MILK. THAT JUST CAME TO MIND. NOT SURE WHY. NO MATTER. I'm WORKING ON A LOT OF MUSIC. I'm GONNA GET BACK TO THAT NOW. GOOD NIGHT MOON.
