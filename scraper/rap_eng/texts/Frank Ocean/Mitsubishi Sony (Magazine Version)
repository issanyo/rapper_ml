[Intro]
When the wind blows
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

[Verse]
I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Ándale ándale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it
