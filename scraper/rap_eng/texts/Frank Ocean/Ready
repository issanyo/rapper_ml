[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl, I hope you miss me
Cos' you know i've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around yeah
I can't do without you
Shawty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in an hour
Just be ready

[Hook]
We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, you ready?)

[Verse 2]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cos' when you came to kiss me yeah
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes pretty hazel brown
If you only knew what I'm thinkin' bout
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shawty my plane leave at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

[Hook]
We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now

Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh

Oh, I know you've been patient
Been waiting on this moment

[Hook]
We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now

Sweet love we'll be making, oh
