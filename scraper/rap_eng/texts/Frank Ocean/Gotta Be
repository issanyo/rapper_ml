[Verse 1: Kent M$ney]
The same feelin' that you get when your troubles go away
I be giving you right here in a lyrical sort of way
It's my pleasure
Really you're all welcome
Couple taps on the chest for the niggas who all felt them
Live life nigga, that's what they all say
But you don't hear them ducking bullets in the hallway
Now that's life nigga
Open your eyes up
And stop frontin' on the team and disguise us
Fly music for all my people to ride to
Common rules and situations to grind through
Couple shots for niggas I never stuck with
A lot of praise for everybody I fucked with
Feelin' same reluctance towards them
I cause them
Everything but pain, they anticipating the reign of me
If you see it you can attain
But beware cause once you get it the feeling won't be the same, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right (right)
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high
I, I got to be right
I got to be right

[Verse 2: Kent M$ney]
Uh, you ain't believing a nigga
Why you coming around
What you perceive of a nigga, huh
Maybe cost a few diamonds bad bitches and a good time
I give these girls great dick and some good wine
You didn't get it when I said that I would do it
Tapping everything you feel
I've been through it, hurts don't it?
Throwing the worst on it
Feeling the curse so we smile for the moment
The pain, we postpone it
Hate niggas, it's a lot of those
Head of the class, the ain't shit honor role
You get a mouse and keys and a opinion
Snapping on the net, in person never offend them
Fall back you on that real life sucker shit
Bring it to my face if you a G, fuck a clique
And I ain't heated
Really homie? I'm chilling
I'm telling you the shit a nigga feeling, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high (high)
I, I got to be right
I got to be right
