[Verse 1]
I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

[Bridge]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

[Hook]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be a gun but you're a girl
Only if whipping could kill

[Verse 2]
Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes - cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I'm finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends around town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you

[Hook]
