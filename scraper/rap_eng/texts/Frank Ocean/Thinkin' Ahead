[Excerpt 1]
"'A storm is coming,' Frank says. 'A storm that will swallow the children. And I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain. I'll deliver the children back to their doorsteps. I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them except for me'..."

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think
I don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white, ooh

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh

[Excerpt 2]
[Lady 1]: We're all so proud of you
[Lady 2]: Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud
[Lady 3]: What are you going to do now?
[Ben]: I was going to go upstairs for a minute
[Lady 3]: No, I meant with your future
[Lady 2]: Your life
[Ben]: Well, that's a little hard to say
[Mr. McQuire]: Ben!
[Ben]: (to the ladies) Excuse me. (He turns around) Mr. McQuire
[Mr. McQuire]: Ben
