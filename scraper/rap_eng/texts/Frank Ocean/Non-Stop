[Verse 1]
I’m knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I’m still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that’s a start

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Bridge]
Said I’m sorry, oh baby
But the love won’t stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, Take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on
