[Verse 1]
Sad he never takes her no where
And she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood

Don't you move cause I'm coming
Girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you
Don't you move

[Hook]
Girl you know thats all you needed to say
You got it, you got it
Let me grab a jacket and I'm on the way
You got it, you got it, oh
