[Verse 1]
I don’t believe in love, cause I don’t feel no pain
Been with so many dudes, it just don’t feel the same
I don’t believe in you, your albums sells ain't true
I believe strippers should get health insurance too
I don’t believe that you gone leave her for me
At that award show tweeting out yall selfie
I don’t believe that you call yourself suing me
I’ve been through enough, why can’t you let me be
I don’t believe that God took my aunt from me
And I’m just crying because I don’t believe in

[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he’ll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing

[Verse 2]
I don’t believe I’m single to this day
I don’t believe in much, but I still pray
I don’t believe the Grammy’s didn’t nominate me
I’m a lil' ratchet, but my music’s everything
I don’t believe my best friend stole from me
I don’t believe my sister cares for me
Make me a mother, and I’ll make me a wife
Never made me smile, but always made me cry
It don’t work out, but I gotta try
And I’m just crying, cause I don’t believe in

[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he’ll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing
