[Verse 1]
Walked off the stage
In the middle of the show
I had to go, I had to see her, see her
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
I may be, but oh I need her, need her
I need her yeah, she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm burning out, I'm showing off
My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law
I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Bridge]
On my way, I'm coming
Stick shift won't get in the groove but I'm coming
Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming, yeah I'm coming
Phone dead, can't talk to you right now
But I'm coming to get you, coming
I'm coming to get you, coming
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby
You got what I what I, I, needed
Oh my baby

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
