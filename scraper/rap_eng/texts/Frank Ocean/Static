Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front. I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl

Doin' 85 on a freeway. Switchin' lanes in my "range"
GPS is saying next exit. I got your text message
I'm on my way to you. Here's what were gonna do
And girl I'll take it to you. Fit closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow. Don't be scared
Touch right there. Make it personal

Its like a force, im stuck onto you like static
