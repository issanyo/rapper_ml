[Verse 1]
Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Tryna' build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get up
They say it's infatuation
I say I don't care what you name it

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Verse 2]
No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
Cos' I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you
Right here baby I'm all good, yup, I'm all good, ah
I'm all good, oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Bridge]
Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination
A dream that won't come true
I know it all can't be just and illusion
I know what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real
