[Intro]
Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

[Verse 1]
I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And thats cost you years

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go

[Verse 2]
I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

[Bridge]
I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
Lift off and go
