Rewind that
Can't get you out of my mind, I want it all the time
You gotta come and rewind that
Baby girls a ten, come on and do it again
Let me see you rewind that
Girl you know I love the sound of when we putting it down
You make me wanna rewind that
Shawty, put the thing on me, and I'm waiting to see if you won't rewind that

[Verse 1]
(Stop)
Shawty what your name is?
Never mind cause you know that I'm famous
Got chicks from LA to Romanians
Baby I want you
(We could take it slow)
Wine you and dine you
Every penny, cause I know you're a diamond
Know what you want
And you know how to get it
Kicking those lips, let me know that you with it tonight

[Pre-Hook]
Fast forward back to my spot
Top of the table telling me don't stop
Touching that place that'll keep you hot tonight
Got it going non-stop tonight and (now pause)
Baby what you tryna' do?
You know the things all up to you
We can talk all night
Or you can leave your crew, and do what we came to do tonight

[Hook]
Rewind that

[Verse 2]
(Stop)
We ain't gotta stop tonight we can do it anyway you like
I can pull on your hair, I can even bite
Or take it way down low tonight
(We can take it slow)
We can grind on the floor
Push those hips against me, I know
When I hit it real good and
You're girls ain't got to know
But you know, so baby girl lets go

Top of the table telling me don't stop
Touching that place that'll keep you hot tonight
Got it going non-stop tonight and (now pause)
