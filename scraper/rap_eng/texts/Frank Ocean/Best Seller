[Intro]
No-huh-ho-no
No-huh-ho-no
No-huh-ho-no
Nooo, no, no

Ohh, I got a love for my ink, it's like tear stains all over my diary pages
We wrote it together, and it tells all the secrets baby
But if this got into the hands, of those who stood against us
They'd try to develop an alternate ending for the tale

I don’t, want ‘em with the story
It don’t, need to be published
No, don’t, put it in stores
Oh, no, whoa, I know

Don’t try to make it a best-seller
A best-seller, a best-seller
It ain’t gon’ be a best-seller
A best-seller (No)

We don’t need the pub, no awards, and no reviews
Sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa, yeah

The publishers been tryna call us, been tryna meet us lately
And I say “It’s precious, and it’s private, sure ain’t for profit”
And if they don’t understand, baby, I ain’t givin’ a damn
I’m tryna protect this, I’m sorry, these chapters ain’t for sale

I don’t, want ‘em with the story
It don’t, need to be published
No, don’t, put it in stores
Oh, no, whoa, I know (Hey)

They’ll try to make it a best-seller
A best-seller, a best-seller
It ain’t gon’ be a best-seller
A best-seller (No)

We don’t need the pub, nor awards, nor reviews
I’m sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa, yeah

Don’t try to make it a best-seller
A best-seller, a best-seller
It ain’t gon’ be a best-seller
A best-seller (No)

We don’t need the pub, nor awards, nor reviews
I’m sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa, yeah

Settle down, settle down (Just settle down)
Listen up, listen up (Just listen up)
Just hear me out, hear me out (Just hear me out)
There’s too much love, too much love (Oh, no)
There’s too much love written up (Oh, no)
‘Cause all our love written up (Our love)
I got my heart written up (You got my heart)
Don’t you sell it, oh, no

Don’t try to make it a best-seller
A best-seller, a best-seller
It ain’t gon’ be a best-seller
A best-seller (No)

We don’t need the pub, nor awards, nor reviews
I’m sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa, yeah

Don’t try to make it a best-seller
A best-seller, a best-seller
It ain’t gon’ be a best-seller
A best-seller (No)

We don’t need the pub, nor awards, nor reviews
I’m sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa

[Outro]
Oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It can’t be that, my baby
A best-seller, a best-seller
