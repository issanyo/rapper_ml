[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

[Pre Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, ( t-tell me that I'm wrong )
But I thought we were

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle, oh....
