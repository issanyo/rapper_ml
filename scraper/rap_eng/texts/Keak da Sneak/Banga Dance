This is another mechanical production
Banga dance this the remix
Town bizness situation
Keak, San Quinn, Shady Nate, J. Stalin

[Hook: J. Stalin]
And if you see me dancing
That's that I got that banga dance
Turf in the air heater in my pants
Mommy I'm strapped so it's on my man
So if I stay with you you better get your friends
Cause when it goes down nigga we don't know nothing
I was sleep in the car man off my tuss

[Verse 1: J. Stalin
I'm back, in front of the club doing the banga dance
Never been a stranger man move the thang in my hand
9 on my right side big thang on the hip
Big shoes on the whip
Rubber grip, won't stick
Young Stalin go dumb
West Oakland where her from
Where he known to carry guns
Order purple by the ton
Stunna shades on the face
Real heavy on the waist
When it's all in the place
Bottles all in the air
Me and my turf we was up in this
See the street in the building I speak for the ghetto children
Cypress Village in the house
Stalin turn a party out
[?] on stage
Ya we get paid
Rocking with young J we in the VIP
You know no pat down no see ID
I got them Frisco boys on the side of me
Livewire, who you thought it was supposed to be

[Hook: J. Stalin]
And if you see me dancing
That's that I got that banga dance
Turf in the air heater in my pants
Mommy I'm strapped so it's on my man
So if I stay with you you better get your friends
Cause when it goes down nigga we don't know nothing
I was sleep in the car man off my tuss

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I don't gotta go dumb where you know I'm from

Stylin' with my nigga J
Strapped like the police
Hit you with the playboy bunny
My boys go beast
Over half of the streets early morning shift
Going up to hoods and getting to dancing with the 45
So somebody a lotta this not included
Never stuck my gun up (?) I'm shooting

Snitches tell, gangstas squeeze

Come get your cheese (?) with ya please

[Hook: J. Stalin]

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

Ice in your grill I'll slap it out
City in the building, savs in the house
Boy I got that .50 cal

Going down in the town we don't call it wildin'
Hyphy, geeked, Quinn and J. Stalin

All on the (?) the believe me cousin
Exhibition doors at 90 degrees
Touchin' on tussin' getting high as a tree
Always a good look to get some good puss
Got a block in the (?) get the hood and push

[Hook: J. Stalin]

[Verse 4: Shady Nate]
Banga on my hip
Banga in my Timberlands
You hopping and skipping jumping around just like an Indian
My lil homie with the cinammon they gonna remember him
The Shady 380 baby the gangsta and the gentleman
I ain't go with the youngstas, parking lot pimping
Doing what I'm doing and I'm spitting what I'm spitting
All in the year I'ma put a bug in it
I go to the club don't want to let a thug in it
I ain't gotta knock nothing, knock on me
They already know what i got on me
Let you boys know about playing with dummies
I'm playing with drummies that's why you see me dancing funny
So if you see me I be where they don't battle rhymes
28 and zip or 8th Street and Madeline
Car full of rippers cause we pile them in
Livewire for hire and I'm 1,000 in

[Hook: J. Stalin]
