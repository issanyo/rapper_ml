[Chrous:  IamSu!]
Hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
From the V to the Rich to the Town
Yeah, you know who brought this Bay shit back
So don't try to do me like that
We up, up and away
Way way way up (way up)
Way way way up
Up, up and away
Way way way up (way up)
Way way way up
Up, up and away

[Verse 1:  Keak da Sneak]
Up here damn it, I ain't comin' down
I'm from the Bay damn it, that's where I'm at now
The sound that the world fell in love with
Still mobbin' on that ass knockin' hoes in the club,  shit
Way up bitch, come around frontin' get your back flipped
Like a burger patty, extra bacon and government swiss
I can't miss, illustrate with the [?]
Oh it only take a minute to pray and a second your down
I ain't gotta tell you where I'm from, you already know
Mouthpiece [?] dough game so I get paid for
I look good when I go, I blow, Bruce LeRoy
Nigga catch bullets with his teeth, nigga please boy

[Chrous:  IamSu!]
Hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
From the V to the Rich to the Town
Yeah, you know who brought this Bay shit back
So don't try to do me like that
We up, up and away
Way way way up (way up)
Way way way up
Up, up and away
Way way way up (way up)
Way way way up
Up, up and away

[Verse 2:  E-40]
E-40, uhhhh
Out the gate, my dual exhaust sound like a jet
From the set, and the ghetto where violence become respect
Gettin' whiskey and tipsy and gettin' high (gettin' high)
Stand by the river long enough, see your enemy floatin' by
K-k-k-key in the stove or in the oven
I can throw you five ounces of game, but you only might catch two of 'em
If you writin' on my name, I'm every noun
Haters jealous, money I'm havin' now (ho...)
Look at the car, beatin' they ass without a paddle
Soil star, me and suckas ain't compatible
Home invaders, do not enter
I practice shootin' with my left in case my right get injured
Biatch!

[Chrous:  IamSu!]
Hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
From the V to the Rich to the Town

Way way way up (way up)
Way way way up
Up, up and away
