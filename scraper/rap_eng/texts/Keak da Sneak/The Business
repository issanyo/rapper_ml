[Verse 1: Keak da Sneak]
Still that nigga they love to listen to
Got your chick sucking dick and then kissing you
I was lost 'til they found me
Swimming in that pussy, treading water, couldn't drown me
I'm from the town B, east fuckin' Oakland
Bay Area business, got 'em screamin, “Bitch what you smokin'?”
Trendsetter, got 'em following like IG
Old soul, looking older than my ID
Oh go back in the day, that was OE
From up north where it's purple kush, OG
Young player nigga, everything on a bitch
Money and muscle, four hustles got a nigga rich
Raised at a fast pace, ain't no slowing down
My Keak senses get to tinglin' when it's goin' down
Black mack got the line on keys and pounds
Prolly respect it anyway, I'ma knock it down

[Verse 2: Kai Straw]
I'm from a small town with a mall in it
Used to be Westfield, now it's a lawn in it
It used to be safe, now it's- umm not really
Bunch of kids yellin' Fairfield
Is the robbin' your mama in broad day on Madison or Jackson
Pointing down but the thumbs out, yelling, “Welcome to the 707”
Braggin' 'bout who been to jail
It was like we were competing with Belial
Like we had pride in the murder rate
Prize at the line was the path to respect is violence
Etched in our skulls, our creed and our motive
It was never given to me, bitch I stole it
Motherfucking carved myself out of stone, dammit
I'll will myself to the throne dammit
I'm a product of my home even though I'm in the skull
I'll forever be from Fairfield, California

[Verse 3: Roach Gigz]
Yeah, San Francisco
Come see the homeless sleep under the [?]
Where skateboarders ollie, tourists ride trolleys
And my mans sell molly, who need it?
The city bleedin'
Techies took over, who they feeding?
Not us, the music got us
From the bus to the Benz
I been snaked, never trusted again
Philly cheesesteak for the win
Same old friends
Step outside and the kids know me
Who would've thought man, young RG
Been putting on for a long time
Pull a bitch with the right or the wrong line
And they let me right in, no long line
I got history and girls missing me
It's no mystery, [?]

[Hook: Kai Straw]
See this tux
See this money
See this cigar
Remember where it started
See this tux
See this money
See this cigar
Remember where it started
Yeah you see this tux
Yeah you see this money
Yeah you see this car
Remember where it started
Yeah you see this tux
Yeah you see this money
Yeah you see this car

[Outro: Kai Straw]
