You know highly flammable got to keep this shit at the
Right temperature you know it's able to blow up

(Keek da Sneek)

I roll a hundred nigga get bread aim to split heads
Get caught in the red get put to sleep fast like Sudafed
Gota get it all n da door you know it's walnut hoe
We hit sets like push up me and my nortenos
Surenos crips blood pimps macs it's gangsta shit whaatttt
Pinky fingers up cuzz I'm still ten deucin
Keep bitches grindin slide cars n boosting
You can catch me out in Houston sipping some syrup
Smoke Sherm in LA ten boot in ice berg
22's pinch the curb we won't worry bout flats
5th wheel no spare extra dub in the back
It's like that it's like that whhaattt
JD I am kill me bitch broke come pick me up
Still mix remy and bubbly in a Styrofoam cup
Still hot lava when I came to erupt
Sizzlin

(chorus)

How you're breath smell like shit and your pop's still living

How You're mom 60 something and she still hop n children
She sizzling she sizzling
