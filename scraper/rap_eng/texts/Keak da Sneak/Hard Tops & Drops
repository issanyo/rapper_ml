(Keak Da Sneak)
Reverse-cut the wheels
Then I flame and drop 'em
Put a low pin on front, back, side to side
That's just how we ride
4 girls, big block
Hemi startin' off from scratch
Custom nice stock
Get to rappin' are we handlin' or losin'
Make it your pink slip too
And you're cheap choosin'
Ain't nothin' like ridin' and smokin' a blunt
Top-drop of the roof back, smoke goin' up
T-tops in the backseat
Get the forecast, get to checkin' with the bad tweak
I be spittin' on the dash that's whats up
Hey man, pass that back -P-Paul Wall, he say whats up
On my hype and my car, tell 'em that I like
Pus I might ride and Sneak come out at night
But the whip come out in summer
T-top sunroof with the drop flames on ya
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
(Paul Wall)
Got money on my mind, so I stay on my toes
And I'm fly like Superman, so I stay on them hoes
Paul Wall baby what it do, hold what you got
All eyes on the champ like to see Ill drop
So I pull up on them bops in they candy caprices
Poppin' all on my stunnas like Hello Clarisse
I got them ocean spray jeans just to match the paint
In the 5th wheel the flame, the remote control crank
My game so buttah cause I'm smooth as silk
Goin' off the handlebars so I'm leanin' with a tip
I'm Somethin' like a quilt cause the game is sewed
And I'm high as the Big Dipper, my brain exploded
Meanwhile body love with the women the grill
In the spotted 91' Fleetwood, so trill
Yeah I'm trunk poppin' when I tip on dimes
Short stoppin' on them boppers cause I got the kinds
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
(Scooter the Executor)
Go with every muscle every bone in my body
I'm about to touch on this so I'ma cop the miadi
Bitch-nigga in the building, spread bitch get naughty
Gotta lose control, she on the pole at the pop
She wanna write us some fatter shit and roll up in some badder shit
X, O drinkin' it as full as a black get
Them battleships, we ride tall on 24's with the
Chromed-out nose and them Lamborghini doors
Pull up at the show and the hoes just fret
Its Scooter the Executor; Too hard to pet
With game is the same, boys out the luck
With the blueberry check up in the tropical punch
Then the cone of jumpin' candy when you stainin' the streets
Pop the top and let the butterscotch melt in the seat
Them papers held hostage in the trunk of the V
When I'm outside of yo mama's house distubin' the peace
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
Hard Top Drops and T-tops
(That's how we ride)
If it ain't drop then it's T-top
If it ain't T-top, won't touch it, bro
Don't stop, Go
