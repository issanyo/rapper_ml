-Mac Dre-

Its Mac dammit man, coming through runnishing
Chop suie got a buck knife in his hand
Finishing the shit that them suckas started
They shoulda ar'a, knew that im coming harder
Fully are a, shot the whole lot up
Niggas trying cut quick, cramped up in a knot
Im a rida, cutthoat general
In 84' I said fuck it, im in it now
Im killing now, letting Mothafuckas know
Im a pimp quit acting like a fucking ho
You ain't know, bitch niggas get played
Razor sharp game, cut you like a switch blade
Its Dre waking up yo family
15 cudie in your drive way, they can't stand me
Paint candy licking like a blow pop
Im so flamie, nigga it don't stop

-B.A.-

Fuck driving, let me out when I slide threw
I drop love, like souls in a ten booth
Fucking wit yo huctes mento
Like im kend to her
But im just a die hard pimp girl
Into a nickname kosie, or call me B.A
I'll send two huctes with yo wife right with me
I know, they say im crazy but I only drink white
Unless im with a snow bunny
So lets get the remy, get the bevi, act stupid
I'll slide through in a fly coup with two cute ones
Keak dat Sneak, plus Mac Dre be the homie
I'll be damn if the hutches think they got something on me
Ho its real, my life is ill
We send em see whats im and get inside their grill

-Keak Da Sneak-

Still highly national, still a killa wit murder flow
Still screaming  all in the do
Bet yo ass down fo, cuz that's the trade mark
Where nothing but brave hearts, thug relutional
Never thought when a muthafucka losing crutal
Collect the doe, thinking ahh and still counting it
Smoking by the pound you niggas still quarter ouncing it
Dry cut let it melt down bouncing it
Nine hundred thousand fo my kids allowance
Im drunk as fuck so I hit the loaf and bouncing it
Still gifted talented, from a notch to a bad bitch
Get mo then yo ass kicked depend on how mad I get
Genet razor dagger shit im leaving faces like naxima attics bitch
Im from mind over money and murder would manage shit
Without a sign, hearding some endings
Tragic shit you want to shine
You ain't fucking with us then who you wit
Thats a perfect way to get yo wig split

-PSD-

Um Hum
The turf nigga, vest up under his shirt nigga
Doing dirty call me dirt sniffa
Like a dirt dopula
Get down foul, and im hurting patna
In da shows on my fo's
Call me curtain droppa
Can't you tell from the dirt in my nail
From down south to my turf of Vallejo
Addiction to this mail is sometin' worser then yell
Make a nigga hi spy something worser then hell
Riding GMC denale it no l's
Wood indegital video 4 12
Possessions are under a zip of weed no sales
For personal need be, give me the fin
With no jail, no jail
