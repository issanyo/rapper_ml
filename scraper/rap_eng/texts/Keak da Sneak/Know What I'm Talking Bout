[Intro]
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
How you fuck with it?
This how I fuck with it, ayy
It's not ebonics
It's [?] speakin', you feel me?
You know, understand this shit

[Verse 1]
I got my crush-proof box, smokin' on a Newport
And don't stop rappin', like my nigga Too Short
I got game, but not the hoop court
And plus, basketball's never really been my sport
I prolly would have made it to the NFL
But I had grams for 50 in my possession to sell
Front shit is punk shit, I cop my own
'Cause niggas be steppin' on it [?]
So I buy it soft, then I cook it myself
Stand on ten deuce 'til it ain't nothin' left
Task force keep a mothafucka out of breath
Gotta be there before my [?] get swept, fuck a left
I'm makin' all rights
Run up on me, I'm takin' flight, show a nigga he really couldn't fight
I'll shake a nigga down for fakin' in the town
[?] kill game, I don't bark, I bite, that's how they fuck with me

[Chorus]
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)

[Verse 2]
I rock like I'm Charlie when I got work
Dirty than a mothafucka, kick, skrrt
Puttin' in work like I make a thousand an hour
Posted on the block sellin' hard, high power
I even got weed, sherm and E's
Fuck with my amigo, see [?]
[?], pure, fuck that cut
Call it a [?] when I ram it up the gut
Run it nigga, can't give him a pass
They call me Keak Sneak, when I come for your ass
'Cause I take livin', treatin' me good
But I'm still in my mothafuckin' hood, I ain't goin' nowhere
You niggas are squar-er than a Rubik's cube
So I rape you, butt-naked, nigga, nude
My whole clique leanin' and smashin', in a [?] fashion
And I hate my enemies with a passion

[Chorus]
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)

[Verse 3]
Breakin' buds off the stem, [?] put it in me
Backwood, ready for the track [?]
Young hyphy and I got a gang of energy, mouthpiece
They wanna assassinate me like J.F. Kennedy
This to the cats that [?] on my gang
Put dirt on my name
But I don't blame, I'd probably would do the same
The style come natural like [?]
This my third album, man, that other shit freestyle
The dopest that you've heard thus far
And I don't buy out the bar, I got a half a gallon tucked in the car
They treat me like a star, and I ain't even much rich
And had over a thousand cars but nothin' to show for the shit
I burn zips of the light fine pine
And fightin' for my glamor 'cause you know I gotta shine
The only thing on my mind is strategizin' how to get this dough
I don't care if it take 'til 2004

[Chorus]
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
I went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'
To yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)
