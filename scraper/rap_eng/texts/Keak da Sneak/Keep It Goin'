(The Mekanix)

[Verse 1: Keak da Sneak]
Sideways, this way, that I park
Work and thumper in the car—bump in the trunk
Feelin’ myself like Dre with me
Sayin’ “When I make it, I’ma bring the whole Bay with me”
Still the People’s Champ in the streets, look
I come through that thang and get it poppin’, turn up the club
Like waa waa waa—yep, that’s how I fuck around
You know like I know how it go down—boy, I’m from The Town
Oakland, with this shit and
EPA, Frisco, Richmond
Pittsburg, Antioch, San Jo
Fairfield, all the way through through the Valley Joe
Struck through Sac, hit Stockton
Modesto had the shit rockin’ (BIATCH!)
What have you lookin’?
50 and drum, look at that big cue and I’m cookin’
No lookin’ back

[Chorus: Keak da Sneak + (E-40 sample)]
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it goin’, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it going, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’

[Verse 2: E-40]
UH! I flip the Caddy, tremendous slappy
Cadillac of Dublin, reached out and grabbed me
Some of you so-called real ones really suckers, not violent
I know some hustlers that’s really solid, not salad
E-40’s back and, spazzin’ and savvin’
I don’t be jawsin’, or jaw-jackin’
You better watch me, I’m comin’ Sasquatch
Go bad on a pussy fuck nigga bidnotch
Niggas be perpetratin’ like they look out they boys
How the fuck you gon’ call yourself a boss if you ain’t got no employees?
Around this muthafucka wit’ your cape on (cape on)
Do anything in your power just to get on (get on)
I could call in a favor or I can pay a fee (fee)
My family don’t even know killer streets put a rock in a hospital over me
Seaside, Monterey, Fresno (Fresno)
Santa Rosa, Berkeley, Hayward, San Pablo, and San Leandro
BIATCH!

[Chorus: Keak da Sneak + (E-40 sample)]
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it goin’, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it going, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’

[Verse 3: Keak da Sneak]
Where my niggas that’ll ride for me, wrong or right?
Bust a head, send somethin’ on a ghetto flight
Hunted down, daytime with a flashlight
Choose sides for your nigga, right here tonight
No bark, all bite, then shake somethin’
Made it a couple times, didn’t fake nothin’
In the front with no front, and I don’t play the back
Come around with all that frontin’, never make it back
All Bay shit, Town Business on mine, mayne
I’m from where newborns from out the womb come with stock game
Never jock another nigga fame, got my own name
And my nigga, nothing’s gonna change if there’s no change
All Bay shit, Town Business on mine, mayne
I’m from where newborns from out the womb come with stock game
Never jock another nigga fame, got my own name
And my nigga, nothing’s gonna change if there’s no change

[Chorus: Keak da Sneak + (E-40 sample)]
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it goin’, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
(Keep it going, though, don’t stop)
When shit hot, no, didn’t stop, I’ma keep it goin’
