(Yo, wassup Keak)
Somethin' went off in my hand on my strap
But I'm smokin' purple, sippin' yac
(Yeah)
Dat's my word
(Hyphie, what it do fasheezy)
Dat's my word
(Mmhmm, Rah Records baby, Dope Game 2, 2)

Somethin' went off in my hand on my strap
But I'm smokin' purple, sippin' yac
Inhaler, I'm primatene mist causin' asthma attacks
Hittin' niggas, takin' early fads, gap backs

Direct the scene, shoot 'em wit' cannon
So how you wanna act?
Bunnatin', oppolatin' the sizzle
In the cut alone for doin' my thizzle

Ohin', drankin', throwin' up the huneds
Solo, but on the low, my buddy
(My buddy)
Doin' hella shit at one time
My definition of hyphie man is thizzin', sniffin' lines

I'm in da buildin' and I'm feelin' like yee
R.I.P. to da Mac DRE
So don't, don't stop, keep it goin'
(Keep it goin')

Wit' some privilege in da back boy, blowin'
(Blowin')
Hold it down for the bay reppin' Oakland
If it wasn't for that granddaddy smokin'
(Dadida)

Ooh ahh, ooh aah, do a little shit
Brapabay, have I lost it? You still wit' me?
Fazeekin', keakin' and sneakin'
All in tha do', wit da nappy fro', I'm still freaky
On lithas, bonitos, senoritas

Turn the tool is the way they stay up on the feature
I see my nigga in da traffic, wassup
Brotha by another motha, first 'cuz, worst bloody
I miss big with the husky brusky

Quarterbackin', trust me, rugby rush me
Color purple, still in the sweet it's ugly
I don't know you but you lovin' me, fresher than douge
Look at wat the mothafuckin' rap game don' done to me

To a grown nigga, run da beat
Here comes Keak Da Sneak
Sell talk, what to do wit' technique, nothin' but heat
Sell talk, what to do on this beat, this for the street

First, second verse, dis my third
Six grade drivin' to school, I had a Firebird
I don't think they knowin, that's my word
Oh, you hip now? I was problem child, you was nerd

I was bein' bad, you was bein' good
But all this time had a destiny to save the hood
All dat shit I been through, look at me now
I'm strikin' like a match mayne back to tha town
(Back to the town)

Bennie cap fowl and my mug on mean
(Mean)
Wakin' up ya family wit' 4 15's
(4 15's)
In tha driveway, they can't stand me
Die hard raider, Sneak Davis, Draft Randy

Moss
(Sukasuk)
Boss gon' be flossin'
(Floss)
Put it on thick like mac lip gloss
(Mac lip gloss)
Oh, inhale dat shit, mayne I ain't takin' a loss
But pay this shit cost 'cause I been had sauce
