Verse 1

'99 Expedition wit the TV's in it
Keep the trees blowin, only way I breathe in it
2 outs, 2 strikes livin' in the 9th innin'
Smack over the gate, I hit the plate now I'm grinnin'
Everybody on ya team when they see ya always winnin'
But ya gotta watch the ones that wasn't wit ya from the beginnin'
Sinnin'
Hopin' God forgive a young thug
Let me die in my sleep, an to the head wit a slug
I hit the bud
I'mma show love, a gang of husts
Stayin' far from the ones that be all in the Ave
No dubs, free admission ghetto celebs
Valet the Expedition
Boss be workin' then I smebbed
Then this game headlined the news
Saw the sheriff
Now I ride quiet on the ??? ???
Second an third look me, "Ain't you Keak?"
I tell 'em "Yup" (yup)
Now the appeals on the floor, so I gotta watch my step
But I'm

Verse 2

When I step through
They say "Sneak, that's you?"
I say, "Nah, baby girl I wanna freak you too"
It's on
Grabbin my bone
I want the pink
Naked, panties all moist go an throw 'em in the sink
I'm High Tech
Rolex an Tim links
Blowin kissin at winks
Got the paper, I got tha ink
She writin her number til I seen a blink, blink
Fight broke out, now everybody in the street
Why can't we juss get along an make ends meet?
Then I thought "Nah, forget it" started hollerin at a freak
I pulled to the side wit my ride
She saw the link
Wit the piece danglin off an it read "Keak Da Sneak"
Baby said "Thats you?! 3 Times you wit dem?!"
As I broke down the weed started suckin on a stem
I said "Shhh! Keep it on the low an hit the strip"
I'm tryin to yell "Timber!" after breakin ya left limb
Foolin wit a light weight, wit a feather in my brim
Then I thought about it.... "Man, there's way more gimps"
We went to go satisfy a High Tech pimp
Wide enough to grip
Walkin wit a limp
But I'm

(Chorus)

All in the door, about 3 or 4 sets of keys
All I want is the money so leave that honey for the bees
Countin hella cheese ain't a day I don't smoke 'em trees
Gotta, have my fix only way I'm feelin at ease
Breeze
Throught Jefferies on Friday's
I'm workin the dress code, then doin what I say
Game, make ya ball like ??? the A-1 yay
Look who's back, man you know who like Donald Bay
Keep the hatas out an let all the playas play
I can't count on my fingers all the work that I knock in a day
You gotta respect me, when they see me, they make way
Surrounded by LG
We don't get down off the ???
California, stayin East of the O-A-K
Been here for six months, cops can't take me away
Yeah, I let 'em go through my wallets ???
Right after I beat him up, they breakin ??? wit a ???
But I'm
