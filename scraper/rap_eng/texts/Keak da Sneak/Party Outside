[Intro]
Straight Town shit mane, you know how we do it mane
Oakland, California baby, welcome to the Bay

League of Starz

Trend on the beat

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Middle fingers up, fuck a dress code (Fuck a dress code)
Security trippin' nigga let’s go (Let's go)
It's more crackin’ out here anyway
I'm bringin' back the parking lot pimpin' mane
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can’t get in the club, we’ll party outside
And if the cops don't come, we’ll party all night

[Verse 1: Keak da Sneak]
Bitch mangler, Hillside strangler
For the sure shot, dice lot, young dangler
On the one when I drop it, middle finger up
No switch hittin' although mothafuckas changin' up
Mobbin' bangin’ up, not bouncin' out
Knowadamean, kn'what I'm sayin', know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Out here damn it, we ain't comin' in
Party outside, it's the more mean team and friends
The king and the [?], never hit the ratchet
But, when that thang bang, I never miss
Make it in a parking spot, pimpin' in a parking lot
Max turned up, burned up, boy kinda hot
The function don't start 'til we come through
And I ain't goin' in if all my niggas ain't gettin' through
Punk shit don't flower me
No searchin' a nigga and my youngins ain't got ID

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Middle fingers up, fuck a dress code (Fuck a dress code)
Security trippin' nigga let's go (Let's go)
It's more crackin' out here anyway
I'm bringin' back the parking lot pimpin' mane
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
And if the cops don't come, we'll party all night

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
What you mean, bruh?
A nigga like me really can't get in the club? (For real?)
Trippin' like that on a hat, nigga, what? (Serious?)
Man, all this shit over a punk ass dub (Twenty dollars)
Security be actin' like a ho (You a ho)
You already know what I'ma do where I'ma go
Nigga fuck that club, we'll party outside
DJ Fabby Davis, six 12s in my ride
On the pavement, it's me and my mens
Do the Caveman, that old Mac Dre dance
We've been out back with the groupies and the stars
We've been in the front with the thugs and the cars
Ain't been in the yard, but I fucks with the mafia (Ayy)
In the parking lot, this shit poppin' bruh
In the parking lot, where it's sparking hot
My niggas still blow grapes, nigga dark or not

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Middle fingers up, fuck a dress code (Fuck a dress code)
Security trippin' nigga let's go (Let's go)
It's more crackin' out here anyway
I'm bringin' back the parking lot pimpin' mane
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
If we can't get in the club, we'll party outside
And if the cops don't come, we'll party all night
