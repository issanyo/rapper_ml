[Intro]
Yo
What's up, Keak?
Zap on my lap and my hand on my strap (That's my word)
I'm smokin' purple, sippin' 'gnac (Yeah)
That's my word (Word)
Hyphy
What it do?
Fa sheezy
That's my word
Mm-hmm
Rah Records, baby
Dopegame 2

[Verse 1]
Zap on my lap and my hand on my strap
I'm smokin' purple, sippin' 'gnac
Inhaler, I'm Primatene Mist, causin' asthma attacks
Hittin' niggas, takin' early fades, gap backs
Direct the scene, shoot 'em with cannon
So how you wanna act?
But nathan, I'm belatin' the sizzlin'
In the cutaluffa, doin' my thizzle (Doin' my thizz)
Oh, and drankin', throwin' up the Hully
Solo, but on the low, my buddy (My buddy)
Doin' hella shit at one time
My definition of hyphy, man, is thizzin', sniffing lines
I'm in the buildin' and I'm feelin' like, "Yee!"
R.I.P to the Mac D-R-E
So don't stop (Don't stop), keep it going (Keep it going)
With some Privilege and a Backwood blowin' (B-blowing)
Hold it down for the bay, reppin' Oakland
If it wasn't for that Granddaddy smokin' (Da-di-da)

[Chorus]
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (Hyphy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (What it do?)
I don't think they know, that's my word (Sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word

[Verse 2]
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, do a little shitty
Ba-da-dup-bup-bup-bup-bay, have I lost it? You still with me?
Fazeekin', Keakin' and sneakin'
All N Da Doe wit' da nappy 'fro, still freakin'
On citas, bonitas senoritas
Turn in two-elevens, one-eight-sevens on a feature
I see my nigga in the traffic, wassup-y?
Brotha by another motha, a first cous', what's bloody?
I mix big with husky brusky
Quarterbackin', trust me, rugby rush me
Color purple, still in the street, it's ugly
I don't know you, but you lovin' me, fresher than Doug E
Look at what the motherfuckin' rap game done done to me
So go on, nigga, run the beat
Here comes Keak Da Sneak
Self-taught, when he do a technique, nothing but heat
Self-taught, what to do on this beat? This for the street

[Chorus]
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (Hyphy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (What it do?)
I don't think they know, that's my word (Sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word

[Verse 3]
First, second verse, this my third
Sixth grade, drivin' to school, I had a Firebird
I don't put that on, that's my word
Oh you hip now? I was problem's child, you was nerd
I was being bad, you was being good
But all this time, had a destiny to save the hood
All that shit I been through, look at me now
I'm strikin' like a match, man, back to the town (Back to the town)
Beanie cap fowl and my mug on mean (Mean)
Waking up your family with four fifteens (Four fifteens)
In the driveway they can't stand me
Die hard Raider, Sneak Davis, draft Randy
Moss, it's the boss, come floss (Floss)
Put it on thick like MAC lip gloss (MAC lip gloss)
Owin' hella shit, I ain't taking a loss
Well paid, this shit cost 'cause I been had sauce

[Chorus]
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
Yadidamean? (Fo' sho) Know what I mean? (Fo' sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (Hyphy)
I don't put that on, that's my word (What it do?)
I don't think they know, that's my word (Sheezy)
I don't put that on, that's my word
