Uh uh uh. Still ain't ready yet
Uh uh uh. Niggas still ain't ready yet
Uh uh uh

I hits the corner on three Daytonaz
Wit a bad ass bitch brought up in Gardena California
Uh she started tuggin' an rubbin' on the Swoop
I'm wastin' my drink swervin in my rag 6 duce
Uh you didn't know I keep it real from head to toe
I hit that savings and loans when I was just a baby loc
Went to Mexico, traded it for the pecos
Came back to California now it's time to roll
I was sixteen mane, sellin' quarter keys of dank
My uncle was a balla from around the way
So I had the hook up
Whole keys I cooked up
Now all my niggas, makin' major figgaz

Mobb shit, the type of shit you out committin' a lick
Pistol whip them nigga to death and have a kick
And the twist 'cause niggas be havin shit
Like bitches on Set It Off, dank
Niggas be sniffin' dark bank
Mission accomplished boss crack
Hard or soft livin' boys and girls packin' yo shit
Let it off
Niggas who floss out here be takin' a loss
It cost to be the mutha fuckin' Boss Playa
Talks to throw away gats in the air
For makin yo scratch like that there Boss Playa
Niggas beware
The ganga-gangsta type of Luni hoolum atmosphere
Fo rappin' about the clothes you wear, I represent welfare
No happy-happy, joy-joy
It's these boys
Runnin' from decoys, pimpin' mo bitches than Dr. Detroit
It goes down
Mr. Smoke-A-Lot turnin' pounds into ashes
Black ski maskes
Niggas be gettin the pumpkin head like Cashus Clay
The Yay
Area smoke greenery malacious all day
Eh, eh blaze

Back in the days, when I was raised
Niggas got sprayed wit A's and K's
I prayed to my Lord that head won't take
Me over, we soldiers to fold ya like Motorola's
And hit the corners
I told ya the 4-4 flow will fuck yo face and leave you frozen
Bitch you was chosen
That's how it's goin the Mobb fa sho-ness
Mo killaz and shady niggas to keep the click-ulation flawless
Fuck all that other
Bury yo brother
Leave yo family mad at the fact the Mobb took me under

Bash 'em other sucka, likely struck wit G's
For tryin' to brace
Cough drops laced and you'll be laid out stunned by zae's
Place the cover in a maced
ATF lookin for this arsonist, lettin off conscience
Hot traces, suicide so you really can't fuck this
Bringin' mo heat than Rapper Bernard
Lookin', micro woof tickets, bout how much to kick it that nigga hard
Oh, from a sucka
Fo them niggas that press they luck there
In a game fucka
Paralyzed caught one in the ass, punk ass
Couped up in an send 'em, an jive
Make niggas remember the Mobb
Them other niggas ain't no kiddin' 'em
An it best be a bounce off Mista, Mista
Hit ya, get ya, split ya
That's how we shit ya

Parafanalia to some Mobb members unpredictable
Niggas get dropped, we call the shots, smashed on sumpthin pitifull
They see us comin they clear the block, our faces unforgettable
The world is a ghetto, and life is a plot
I'm surrounded by nimphos
Givin' up info
On where you hide yo doe an indo
Guess what you in for
You bout to find out
That shit we in, we all contenders
You don't know, you seen a nigga jumpin' through yo window
Don't even trip
I confiscate this money in the name of the Mobb
It's on yo bitch
We'll juss pistol whip this nigga to a coma
Jump in the get away ride and hit the corner
Yo bitch juss got mopped (the Mobb is gonna)
Yo bitch juss got mopped (the Mobb is gonna)

Get ready to get yo gats out niggas
Fo all you wacked out niggas
Bitch made batched out niggas
Jaw jacked out niggas
I'm not gonna to patch out niggas
These niggas don't really give a funk about yo snitch ass
Never in yo life met a gat that blast on the streets at a lame ass
Bitch ass nigga
No cash gettin-er
Hustlin' pretendin' to be a gangsta
Switch hittin' ass, nigga too late
He wanted his boy to get dumped in wit a 4 chrome that nigga ain't
Dumpin' on nothin'
Must be runnin', and duckin' and dodgin' in buckets
Then shittin' up in yo mutha fuckin' drawls
Coward
These bitches I put 'em on the Mobb we gotta get gone
Before a nigga cool his gun
Real nigga runnin' from Mobb
Will throw away Glock
Won't pistol go drop
Never go Mobb
When the 4-4 stop
Will a nigga get mopped
Fo restin' my knot
Tell 'em to get yo grill knocked out
You fuckin' wit niggas that'll have ya noddin' like ya hopped out
3 Time for the O-A-Kiz-a
We folks all day
Ager, Sneek an the B.A
Put him in the trunk wit a bump, an we Mobb throught the Bay

Don't get it twisted we got restrictions
Niggas that witnessed family beatins
From family meetins
No family grievins
Juss some youngstas
Grew up around dirt an dope, an jelous
Evil tactics
To shovel up caskets, and double barrell
Shotty blasted
I'm knowin' these suckas can't catch these bodies flowin
Murders so ancient, they faces got federal cases closed
And cross the game it ain't the thang
Swoop G plus two G's will make them niggas for you to hang
An try to be cool when Mobbin on them niggas as we reign
It's Money Ova Bitches, broke the skrilla fuck the fame
Sight of soldiers shock the world like Rodney's girl
And we ain't discussin' shit
We bustin' clips
To makin' 'em hurl
Bullets makin' them bustas curl
An I put that on the Mobb nigga
We Mobb niggas
Includin' everywhere we go
That's how we do it

When you see Num, you see Mobb
How happly if you need job
Even if you be Slobb you need not worry 'cause we Mobb
Slobb don't mean Blood
An Cuzz don't mean Crip
An Oakland is a term for broke bitches makin grip
When we sip
We laid out, to drip-drip dry
We be slip-slip ride
Through the Town doin' high-bys
When the yak hit my face it's like a hamburger kill
We'll be real
What's the deal
Uh, uh, searchin' fo skrill, up here!
Wit these tires burnin' off like lavishly
Makes it easier for me to dig out these hoes like cavities
Havin' these thang is like a
Government task
M.O.B. not searchin' fo aliens we won't ask
