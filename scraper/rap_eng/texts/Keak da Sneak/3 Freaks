[Verse 1: Keak Da Sneak]
Keak Sneak and a Turf Talk and a
Dos in the trunk and you gon' get that shit
(If you think 's over, it's not)
One into two, know what I'm saying? It don't matter, just don't bite, aight?
I pulled up, jumped in the scraper
Me no pay for nothin', I'm spendin' the bitch paper
Thigh, leg, wing, a nigga with no biscuit
Let's start something, hey, Turf, man, look at these chicks

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
Rock with it or not
If I can't get in the club, the club in the parkin' lot
Man, my stomach ain't achin'
But I'm a boss, I don't pay too much for nathin'
Know you bought it, knocked it, and recopped it
Dat Turf and Keak (Turn it up and knock it!)
Turf got flows, he got murder ink
I two peace a nigga up out this drink
They can talk, but let 'em touch ya
Dirty nigga keep heat up under his blubba
Before the rap game, hood rich
Hate a nigga, but boy, another bad bitch
I ain't gotta ask, man, I know already
A real hood nigga wouldn't be that pretty
I ain't here for no problems
But let there be less bitin' and slobbin'

[Verse 3: Keak Da Sneak]
Three in the house, Jack Tripper, he had two
When I keep something, click online, like "what it do?"
It's Keak Sneak, baby, and did I mention I'm crazy?
Even Joe can see that you ain't forever my lady
I got needs, and my wants is up to you
Poppin' tags and believe me that three is better than two
So I, oh I, skeet-skurt, figure 8 man...
