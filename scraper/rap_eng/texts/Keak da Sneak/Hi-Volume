[Keak Da Sneak]
And you can catch me in Bent red artlidge, 2K3 Bentley
Leader not a follower so don't ask who sent me
Paid for, no lease and you can't rent me
Still grinding worth grand Bobby and Whitney
X pills keep you up all night
Bottles of everything and that guada green light
I'm in the club like 50, not Shady Aftermath
Tricks treat em like they offset, I'm the number one draft
Wholes not halfs a nickel thirty six
And raw, raw raw raw raw like the top of the rick
I hit like rick drums kick and claps
Six 15's zeus zap on my lap
Keep a fadango rolled boy I never would crap
Paystyles no longer free when I rap
I adapt in any 'viroment or the weather
Got many personalities, nigga my mouthpiece is cheddar

[Hook]
This how I ride like it ain't no tomorrow, don't beg or borrow
We take shit, and seperate our stuff from the fake shit
The jam start sockin, make ya feel like a quake hit
The whole block rockin with intention to shake shit
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)
Now this (should be played at hi volume, resedential)

[Keak Da Sneak]
And my watch I can't even pronounce
That cost three huned thousand tax in the states in year round be my account
All I wear is gucci and louie, ice berg
My mistress will get you down, she cop me that throw back Spurs
Get yours, the voices in my head be tellin me
You misdemeanor I'm a felony, give up sports and start sellin D
Now I'm like waitin on the rap shit
Assholes and elbows, get up in ya like catpiss
Quiet on the set I'm recordin
Caught my first trial then I faded just like Michael Jordan
Stompin in my Air Force 1's
Blockin niggas, strong armin with no gun
I rap for funds, mucho denero
Got my hoes bringin me 10 G's a night, the cousin Nefero
I just jet like this and get a battery charge
Pimpin and playin, I tell ya Keak Da Sneak is hard

[Hook]

[Keak Da Sneak]
I sell my rock in the studio or the streets
Gone blow up but not cuz I'm signed to a Dre or a Pac beat
On the Rick Rock sheet, and no I'm not the best kept secret
Cuz everybody know about this Keak Da Sneak shit
Danger! Not Mystikal but get on the flo'
The man right chear, All In Moe Doe
My style my flow is original as hell
Cuz who is who in this industry, I just can't tell
Everybody sound like Nas or Jay-Z or Jadakiss
Nelly or Ja Rule nigga I hate this shit
I come wit that shit you never heard befo'
And everybody say "fa sheezy" but where my credit though
East Oakland make that work
10-Deuce and Walnut trick fuck what you heard
Quit sayin you sellin birds like you wanna get caught
Cuz if niggas accidentally snitch on you it's all yo fault
And quit tryin to put 2Pac Shakur in ya rhymes
Niggas get shot for being at the wrong place at the wrong time
Left shirt and show ya bullet wounds off to ya ho
But you don't really wanna get shot no mo', that's why
