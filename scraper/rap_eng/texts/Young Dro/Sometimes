[Intro: Young Dro]
I feel the glory
Yes, Sometimes
Give another to God
Who the head of my life
Check it, eh

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
For some of the roughest niggas
To the toughest niggas
We ain't gotta discuss it
We just go head and bust a niggaa
You could tell we had a cool camp
In Etheridge, Momma still selling her food stamps
I rather dig these niggas in the hood
'Cause they similar to me
I'm walking through to 'jects
Pit bull brindle with me
A OG, I remember 'fore I met Lil C
Right before I brought LA to meet JG
And me and Tip was already Bankhead boys
From Campbellton
Adamsville, Hamilton
I was stackin' them Hamiltons
I was in the nine
Delmar lane was shinin'
Me and Troy used to wrestle for money all the time

[Chorus: T.I.]
From the pens to the streets
In the roof, in the coup
Now I don't always do this fool, but
(Just sometimes)
Believe in ya
I always knew you were the truth
I'ma always do this for you
And not just
(Just sometimes)
You gotta put it all on the line
Got weed on me
Hope that's all they can find
(Just sometimes)
Don't always go to war about mine
It's to the death
Keep that on yo' mind
This ain't just
(Just sometimes)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Remember us in Brad house
We were hot as a firehouse
See KT at the corner store
What you talking to Fly 'bout?
Anything I know we buss it
Divide it equally, frequently
Man keep it G
How many ninth grader you know, that's seen a key?
Me and C
Had a trap rollin' long time ago
Got kicked outta there
'Cause I wouldn't sell his mama blow
Never could
Way too much respect
It'd been understood
Brother to the death
We the last niggas left
Remember me and Dro at Riverdale
He in the country, nigga hell
Had a shoot out with the henhouse
My mama said, You better not come in here
But me and Cap' in the mall, what the tool for?
Tryna fuck me, hold up
What you tryna go to school for?

[Chorus: T.I.]
From the pens to the streets
In the roof, in the coup
Now I don't always do this fool, but
(Just sometimes)
Believe in ya
I always knew you were the truth
I'ma always do this for you
(Just sometimes)
You gotta put it all on the line
Got weed on me
Hope that's all they can find
(Just sometimes)
Don't always go to war about mine
It's to the death
Keep that on yo' mind

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
It's in control, he always keep it real no cap
Summerhill me and Boot fired DT Moore and Kemp (For real)
Anybody get it, Haygood Ave., hittin' the dab
Me and Coco still on Dill Ave
In the last, still be with Bobo
Pittsburgh, me and Jojo
Killed, Bankroll Fresh I was hurt on the low low
I don't like the way the city behavin'
They killed Caiden
Big ken done lost his leg
Kappa the home baby
They go to home, boss burnt down right by university
Tear White and Dint Dint, that's who had the work and shit
Tellin' you this in confidence
Don't you go repeating shit
A-Town trap shit
Danny boy and Meechie bitch

[Chorus: T.I.]
From the pens to the streets
In the roof, in the coup
Now I don't always do this fool, but
(Just sometimes)
Believe in ya
I always knew you were the truth
I'ma always do this for you
And not just
(Just sometimes)
You gotta put it all on the line
Got weed on me
Hope that's all they can find
(Just sometimes)
Don't always go to war about mine
It's to the death
Keep that on yo' mind
This ain't
(Just sometimes)

[Outro: Young Dro]
No cap man, you know what I mean?
(Just sometimes)
I'm talking about, Kimberly Court shit
Man, you couldn't even come out there, man
We'll jack yo' ass on the motherfucking Marta bus
(Just sometimes)
For real, you know what I'm sayin'?
All the way to pay wrong with this shit, man
Adamsville, Flatland, Alexville
(Just sometimes)
See what I'm saying?
Cecil road, Edgewell
Y'all already know what going on
(This here's the deal)
Yeah, nigga, you already know
(Just sometimes)
Excruciating pain when you fuckin' with a motherfuckin' gangster
You know what I mean? No cap
Y'all nigga 'round here on count check
(Sometimes)
With all this bullshit goin' back and forth with a lame
Man you gon' get killed
(Just sometimes)
Sometimes, at least
