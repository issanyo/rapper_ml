[Young Dro] *variations throughout*
High five (high five) high five (high five)
Hey (whats happ'nin)

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm dead fresh man I keep this shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
My Chevy paint flippin on my rims got that indiglo
When it get dark rim glowin like my wrist glow
F-650 pro my rims look like 64s
Sit taller than everybody I'm up there with the red lights
Slick Dro it's me chicken money KFC
Crispy dark meat the carbon come in all heat
You know how the mob be they got me eatin shark meat
Order me a snail plate I think I want some frog meat
Triple thick chinchilla take the skin off the lizard
Put it on the Benz interior... imperial
I'm bustin and I'm furious I'm scratchin off the stereo
Knock him off tonight and in the morning let his children know
Bitches get flip-flopped I feed 'em all Cheerios
Shine on them 24's I know how to get a ho
Big bank wet paint Jackie Chan stereo
Money hungry Dro eatin paper like a billy goat

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm dead fresh man I keep this shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)

[Verse 3]
High five westside Bankhead prolly clean on me
Four 15's so you know my trunk really beat
Screens start flippin when they flip here the DVD
Ridin down Simpson me and T.I. watchin "Lean on Me"
Carbon 16 on me 30 carat ring on me

Leelee gangsta grill wit me Trineshia spent a mill wit me

Baby mama Dolce Gabana ask Tiereney
Dark on black buttons I'm ridin on nothin's

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm dead fresh man I keep this shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)
