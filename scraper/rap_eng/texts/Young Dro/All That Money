(Chorus)X2
Girl you makin all that money
Dont let nobody treat u treat u. You makin all that money
Dont let nobody treat u treat u

(Verse 1)
Booty club 25 grand
Fat pockets look at my pants
We too deep look at my clan
Polo clothes look at my brand
Dro i came here to look at ya'll dance
They say i make it rain so I'm kickin out grands
My potna spent seven and my homie spent three
I spent bout eleven so that's 20 some g's
Just got started and we don't wanna leave
10 for the clit now put yo hands on yo knees
Naw i ain't broke but I'm still on E
I'm rolling like a mother fucker pills on me
Real low key shaking hard for the bread
Still in school so she smart in the head
First Magic city now we all went Onyx
Do it for a stripper makin all that money

(chorus) X2

(VERSE2)
She dance for you like she dance for me
She don't handle you like she handle me
She know i came up in that lamborgine
Shakin her stuff like a tambourine
All my diamonds are tangerine
Throwin this money like Dan marine
All shawty need is a pampering
She'll jump when u call like a trampoline
Got my motor running like Valvoline
Give me what i want u can have the cream
My drop top Chevy so apple green
These niggas in the club they trap with me
So much money they after me
Black Maserati in the scrap with me
Carats on my neck call me young joe bundy
We can blaze up the saddle be on platinum 21's
Dro

(Chorus) RPT X2

(VERSE 3)
Do it one time for the whole club heat, do it one time for the whole magic city,do it one time for the girls in the struggle
