(Chorus)

[Spodee]
Me and Djuan do so much 96 Master P it's No Limit with us
Kick so much flavor we got haters sour you think its lemon with us

[Dro]
I hit'em with guns and take all the broads and tell'em come turn up with us
I'm rockin' that foreign, you just deformed
YSL all up on us

[Spodee]
I'm following the Bentley I'm probably killin' it, all of them villains with us

[Dro]
The Mob in the building, we robbing and stealing, you should be dealing with us

[Spodee]
From the opposite of these novelist disrespect us that's the minute I bust

[Dro]
I'm taking the cola, baking the soda how you go TU on us?

(Verse 1: Young Dro)
I'm taking the top off the Benz
I'm finna rocc 'em again (rocc em, rocc em)
Break'em and rack'em and stack'em again
Look how I got up again
My swisher, my swisher, my swisher
I'm finna FYE up again
My pistol, my pistol, my pistol
I'm finna pop it again
My gator from China
My coogi Australia
My lady from China
Overseas ballin
All up in Germany
Where is my lighter???
I'm cool as a cat with the whiskers
I'am back in the fiscal
Me and a model her name is Melissa
I am on Molly I kissed her
Smooth as a fiend in a Phantom
Looking like Tony Montana
DRO and Young Spodee the man in Atlanta
Keeping my hands bananas
All of my bitches get Birkin
They don't know which one I'm working
Rocking that GU GU
Rocking that LU LU
This for then hoes who be twerking!!!

(Chorus)

(Spodee verse)

Last night I caught ah ho on DOA who hadda doll face
No hesitation tolda let me fuck the frog way
She laugh!! Complimenting my broad taste
10 hrs later had that ho on blvd place
I be clean!!! I dress up the sharp way
How bout blue Mason Mars jello with the odd lace
Custom made leather jerseys for the block sake
I shoot'em broad day they murder in my neighborhood all day
They know it's a G!!
That's how they know when it's me!!
My Chevrolet over the trees!
In my motors a beast!!
Nigga My flow is elite!
I'm lyrically colder than to freeze!!
In I'm holding the heat!!
Last nigga that was holding on me!
He was floating at sea!
Now the bitch nigga over deceased!
Screening the codeine
Eatin' rollin' on 3
Na I'm smoking my dope for relief

(Chorus)

(Young Dro & spodee verse)

I am a BEAST
Lions all over my chest
Fendi all over my beat
You'll get deceased
You'll be decapetated on the aisles of Davis
Them lames can't TU on me

I pay like a pimp is suppose
My disposition is cold
Playing on niggas & hoes
With figures I can't count wit my fingers & toes

Wrists are froze!
AK & tommy gun strap to my arms
Nitro glistening bombs
Favorite position
Back'em pick'em shawty throw'em
Lyrical shawty go dumb

I come from the slum
Grew up in the hall like arsenio
Had so much fun as a criminal
Now I'm just lyrical
Molly, lean, & midis-sable
Importing parts of my rituals
Hoes are flexable
Rollies oysters Perpetual
Really I'm cold as a Eskimo
Ballin I'm ballin I'm ballin
They fouling me technical
Beam on your head like a decimal
Ho keep on callin in callin
She callin in-ethical
She do not fit in my schedule
I'm a professional
Spodee campaign is congressional
Yo baby daddy ah vegetable
And I eat BEEF!!

(Chorus)
