[Intro]
Dirty, dirty money, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
All the dirty money, all the dirty money
Fingernails dirty, running through a birdie
And the 1st coming, and the 1st coming
Fuck what you heard, order up a bird
Tell them boys run it, tell them boys run it
Blue cheese, nigga, blue cheese, nigga
Hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred
Dirty, dirty money, dirty, dirty money

[Verse 1]
I'm wrapping keys, spending rapper, rapper shit
On that Activis, on that trapper shit
Pocket full of green, cabbage, cabbages
For the cash hang you over balconies
When I spray, I spray your whole faculty
Football pockets, nigga go and tackle me
Hulk Hogan bricks, go and wrastle me
WWE, bubbly, bubbly key
Trap bumping on the 1st and 15th
Pussy nigga why don't you come and fuck with me?
Break down, I ain't fucking 'round
Get my partner pound, buy another pound
And the chopper hold bout a 100 rounds
Blam, blam, blam, gun you down
Dirty fingernails, counting dirty money
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty money

[Chorus]
All the dirty money, all the dirty money
Fingernails dirty, running through a birdie
And the 1st coming, and the 1st coming
Fuck what you heard, order up a bird
Tell them boys run it, tell them boys run it
Blue cheese, nigga, blue cheese, nigga
Hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred
Dirty, dirty money, dirty, dirty money

[Bridge]
All the dirty money, all the dirty money
Chopper hold bout a 100 rounds
Blam, blam, blam, gun you down

[Verse 2]
Flipping, flipping keys, tell em I'm up again, let me re-up again
I'm buying 40 blocks, selling 40 blocks, let me re-up again
Nothing but fish scale sitting up in the truck again
I got the Act boy, tell them jack boys I'mma bus-bus-bust again
Yeah, they call me a birdie player
I got them dirty nails
I got that dirty money
Tell your bitch "go to hell"
Tell the car, "bring it home"
Tell the feds, "Dro ain't at home"
I know they be tapping my line, I don't even play the phone
It's ringing, it's ringing, it's ringing
My pinky ring blinging, it's blinging
If a nigga try to play me for the players I'mma nut up like semen, semen, semen
I got them whole thangs sitting up in a Porsche car
And my bitch sitting up in a Testarossa car
I got my fingernails dirty from the dirty money, dirty money, rolling broads

[Chorus]
All the dirty money, all the dirty money
Fingernails dirty, running through a birdie
And the 1st coming, and the 1st coming
Fuck what you heard, order up a bird
Tell them boys run it, tell them boys run it
Blue cheese, nigga, blue cheese, nigga
Hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred
Dirty, dirty money, dirty, dirty money

[Bridge]
All the dirty money, all the dirty money
Chopper hold bout a 100 rounds
Blam, blam, blam, gun you down

[Outro]
That thang stank bruh. You've been trappin' all day?
