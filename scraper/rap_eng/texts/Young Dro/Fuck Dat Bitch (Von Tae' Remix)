[Intro: Von Tae']
West side, east side I’m in there
North side, south side I been there
Anywhere, everywhere, where I be
A bitch that holler 'bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch

[Chorus: Von Tae']
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler 'bout "fuck me?"
(hold up, hold up) Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler 'bout "fuck me?"
(hold up, hold up) Nah, fuck that bitch


[Verse 1: Von Tae']
I ain't stressin' over hoes
I ain’t trippin’ over niggas
Frontin’ for these fuckas
Gon head, pour the liquor
Man gon’ head and be easy
Sick of these niggas, I’m sneezing
Might run up on you niggas while you sleepin'
While you sleepin'
So Jack be nibble jack be quick
Before your bitch fall on my dick
I’m over seas, with the breeze counting pesos
I got your hoe on her knees doing deep throat
She won’t let go, Ain’t playing games
But she wouldn’t let go even if Simon said so
Cause she know I’m the realist
And she know that you just joking
She been down on her knees for a while now
She like a Ford , she Focused


[Chorus: Von Tae']
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler 'bout "fuck me?"
(hold up, hold up) Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler 'bout "fuck me?"
(hold up, hold up) Nah, fuck that bitch
