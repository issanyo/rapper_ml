[Intro: Hit-Boy]
HS87 we the plug!
Who the plug? We the plug!

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
This just what I do, I do it often
Your niggas be talkin', my niggas be workin'
We get up, Donnie McClurkin, we don't fall now
Rather fuck up the mall now
Stuck up girls, they call now
A whole lot of family they all proud and we all gone cause that pack loud
Check mate, I've got it covered like parentheses
Niggas I looked up to only feelin' me or fearin' me
These niggas ain't real, these niggas posin' they just figurines
Set up to run the game, I'm on a murder music killing spree (kill 'em)
Who the fuck, who the fuck is that?
Oh, allegedly he's the man, that's why I came in makin' demands
And i'm tired of talkin' my plans
I'mma show you niggas what's goin' down
Like elevators and escalators my old bitches in discounts
HS87, you been hatin' since '87
Bustin' moves with my collective
And I ain't got no reception
For no nigga talkin' down, or no nigga talkin' dumb
That's on my mama, sista', cousins, and the plug nigga
On everything that I love

[Hook: Young Dro] x2
On everything that I love
On everything that I see
I'm good bitch, I'm hood rich
I got everything that I need

[Post-Hook: Young Dro]
I got everything that I need
I got everything that I need
I got everything that I need
I got everything that I need
I got everything that I...

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Flip flop shorty, only thing I know is wet paint
Plus we got a body in the trunk, I think the whip stank
Ridin' through the project, get some reefer from my auntie
Sip four, slidin' up in L.A, me and Bun B
Triple barrel, barrel, barrel, nigga this a sawed off
Nigga keep on talkin' shit, I'mma blow his jaws off
Kid with the K, let's see which one of these hoes is down to deal with the day
Tell that bitch my dick look like a candy bar - Milky Way
On fire, Make your bitch scream like a geyser
Nigga look at these rims on the Viper
You do not want me to Skype her
Do ya ball?
Shoot of your ear and ball
Shoot of your leg and ball
You better duck 'fore I shoot off your head
Dro, on everything I'm on drugs
My gun, transform, on everything it throws slugs
I'm shittin' on em like drawls
Giuseppe shoes in the club
You with your bitch, I take your bitch, on everything I love

[Hook: Young Dro] x2

[Post-Hook: Young Dro]

[Outro: Hit-Boy]
I got everything that I need, that's on everything that I...
Everything that I need
Everything that I love
Everything that I see
Don't forget it bitch, it's Hit-Boy on the key
