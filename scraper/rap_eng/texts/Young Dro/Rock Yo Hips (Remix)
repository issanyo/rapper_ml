[Chorus:]
I like it when she
Rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips
She rock her hips
She rock her hips then
Wave and sip

Shawty rockin' her hips and shakin her tailfeather
Workin that pole 10 thousand bills later I asked
Shawty do she feel me on the base line she bounced that ass like she lost her got damn mind
But me a playa laid back that's a fact
Straight yak no ice real nigga maniac
Now shawty bounced it like that like this
Like everythang the base and she droppin' that shit

[Diamond:]
It's the same 32 flavors but sweeter than sweet potatoes
New haters but bigga paper so case of honey dip
Jolly ranchers on my feet and starburst off in my wrist
Reese's Pieces necklace everytime u see this chick look
I make it wobble my peach cobbler make you slobber
Break a nigga out of dollars if he try to holla
So now u know when I'm rockin' on the dance flo'
I might just take yo' man hoe take it like a man hoe

[Chorus]

Hay booty hood chick Georgia peach caramel
Fine as hell can i touch it u work that shit well
Tryin' tease take my number hit me up like later on
I know u gettin to the money that yo hustle well then get it on
Lookin' great with them stilettos hill shoes
With that coke bottle shape and just make a nigga choose
Ooh ooh shawty you
Make it jiggle make it clap
With that bone in yo legs I'm overwhelmed by all of that

[Rasheeda:]
I rock my hips when the song on
You know yo girl Rasheeda get poppin' like some popcon'
See I'm sweeter than a watermelon blow pop
Then make it hurricane everytime I pop and drop it
See I'm a boss I'm a bad chick
I can lock yo' nigga down like a convict
See I talk a lot of shit but I can back it up
Sexy when I rock my hips when they tat tatted up

[Chorus]


[Young Dro:]
Cause I'm hot god damn it my roof panoramic
Bitches in the car tryin' to make me out a sandwich
Hay the way she pop and roll I was like damn it
Mouth work so good man shawty need (?)
And the bitches they mark me bitch is Ferrari
Young Dro I got all the hoes like Mike Lari
Y'all mean tire y'all team liars
Drizzle in the building y'all seen fire

[Chorus]


[Princess:]
Frustration poppin' rockin' slow breakin' pockets got the dough
Just give me one chance to take ya man you better keep him close
Uh-uh don't think about it go with the flow I got yo back
Drop to the flo' bring it up like that Princess back and pockets fat Ain't nothin' change still glamorous and top notch
Ridin' still and won't stop so sit back while I rock
Gettin' paid while I pop shinin' cause I'm always cryin'
Hypnotized the kid excited Princess A-town's finest

[Chorus]
