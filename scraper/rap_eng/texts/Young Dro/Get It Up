Ok now Try me wrong you get knocked off
Riding around wit tht top off
I heard ya broad got super head
U knw im tryna get topped off
When i showed up the shit popped off
Trunk full of that block soft
My partners still standing on the curb

We switching broads and we switching cars
Forgiauto on the whip is hard
Yo hoes dumb and my bitches smart
Fuck niggas we disregard

Dont make me brang them missles out
My Glock clip is extendo
Tell them lames sit this one out
We dranking purp and we rollin purp and my nerves bad im bout to go berserk

(Yun Quest)

Photogenic demeanor im something you should dream of
My mind is out of space gotta get my outfit out the cleaner
Star studded diamond voice im jumping out the speaker
I be fucking these niggas girl and they still wanna feature
Wait a minute let me teach ya
How to satisfy the market
Gotta dumb ya flow down
Find your demographic then target
Im more than just a artist
A poet slash grinder
She dont stand a chance she let me get that vagina
Getting to that money nigga what you know bout loyalty
Rapping on the track but on the hook it sound like four of me
Real shit my poetry
Verses cost your lawyer fee
Tell me what you know bout this homeboi u want some more of me

No Matter
What Go On
Every day
We Gone Grind
We Get it In
Thats WAssup
Keep That Money
On My Mind

We Get It Up
We Get It Up
We Get It Up
We Get It Up
