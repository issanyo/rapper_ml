[Hook]
Rubber band banks (boing yoing yoing yoing)
Tokyo Diamonds (joing yoing yoing yoing)
Grand Hustle ice (it be glowing yoing yoing yoing)
When we in the club (they think its snowing yoing yoing yoing)
28 inches (in the A yay yay yaer)
We be deep (everywhere yer yer yer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yay yaer)
You know I got them choppas (cause ima spray yay yay yaer)

[Verse 1]
Ima outer space baller, put you up on astronomy
Mathematically with a pistol I do trigonometry
Humbly, eat up a nigga like a piranha B
Riding in the cutlass same color as a bumble bee
I had to man I brought the flip flop jag through
Paint the Chevy sad blue, you know my dad was sad blue
Ride straight pass you, my choppas will outlast you
I promise I'mma smash you, 30-06's blast you
600 see through Benz call it the glass coup
Diamonds look like Passion Fruit, Viper look like Apple Fruit
Ride through the hood you know the Burban look like Snapple Juice
Bricks from black facts, from Summa Hill Pappa 2
Rapper who, bitch you know I'm the Best Thang Smoking
Hit em in the neck with the Tec, and leave ya throat smoking
Dro Rollin, bitch I got a million for yo million
We up in these hoods trapping, building after building

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love flipping down screens, and love riding 23's
Love gliding down the street, and love watching Lean On Me
Love paying Ten-a-Key, love selling pounds of weed
Love in the club when my thugs are surrounding me
Ain't nobody bouncing me, DJ is announcing me
Shawty say she want Dro, I think she want a ounce of me
Fed's trying to pounce on me, I'm larger than a mountain be
Shawty say she fuck with Grand Hustle bitch bounce with me
Ice come from Tokyo, roll like a roly-po
5 blunts of total dro, I think I'm bout to overdose
Trunk ain't bumping and jumping, it got the holy ghost
Bricks by the 50, 10 naw shawty 40 more
Trap time nigga, yeah strap time nigga put down bet a rubber band, crap time nigga, in my lap a nine nigga
45 in the console, show em how the reversible clip'll do a drum roll

[Verse 3]
28 inches (in the A ya yaer)
G4 (in the A ya yaer)
Young Dro (waves in my hair ya yaer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yaer)
Rock Cartier, I'mma Chief like an Indian
Freaks are Caribbean, my feets are amphibian
Prototype Bentley with Celerian and Vivian
Dark sniper riding in the Viper up in Michigan
Fucking with my clique'll get you lost like Gilligan
Dro is on the pill again I promise I'mma kill again
Y'all fake niggas how the fuck could you be real again
Murder all foes I trap 'em up than I seal 'em in
Rubber band fitted, extra tan Chevy
Straight-drop glass got that extra tan ready
Cutlass Cam ready paint, extra Cranberry
Ice Cream Chevy, nigga Ben & Jerry
