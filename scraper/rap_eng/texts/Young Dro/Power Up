[Verse 1]
Had to power up, out the Yucatan, I'm a hooligan, look at these
I don't need car keys, everything on my wrist look frosty
Cross me, bitch look bossy, nigga you don't know what this cost me
Uh, been through shit, show you how it feel on my mental shit Made me wanna rip through shit, yeen down in the struggle then forget you bitch
All on my toes, hold up hoe, who sent you bitch?
Kill em, flavor, flavor, mix it wit swag, callin' me swavor
Shoe, tailor, tailor, these are my crocs, these are my gators
I am a beast, let me release, I kill 'em all wit my ammo
They call me commando, Mr. went Rambo [?]
These are the standards, you can get handled
Nigga welcome to Atlanta, mob ties
You see it, you see it, you see it, Dro Soprano

[Hook]

They wonder why I got a lot of bottles, I been on the charger, let's go
One, warning, don't try me
Two, cock back, I'm firing
Three, bow, crazy, pull up in the Benz, eyes lazy, uh

Its a disaster, I am the master and I'm killin' em backwards
Wait till I get you, I'm gonna give you your lyrical issue
Wait till I pull it, spit it, these are the bullets, ripping your tissue
They will not miss you, they do not hear you
I kilt all your homies, your homies, your homies
They are not near you

[Hook]
