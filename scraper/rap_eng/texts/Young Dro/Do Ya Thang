[MacBoney]
Fresh out the house, got the beat on suicide
As I ride up and down Martin Luther King Drive (do ya thang)
Standing tall looking down on the block
These boys snitching all day, I look around on the block

[T.I.]
I'm in a silver SL five pound on the block
Ain't you ever seen a young player clown in a drop? (do ya thang)
Ain't nun to a G, game spit fluently
Groups of hoes pursuing me, as if it's more than two of me

[Young Dro]
Monday my Chevy orange, and Tuesday it's ocean blue (damn)
Twenty-eight set over you, Ferrari drops and Rovers, too (do ya thang)
Hoes, sit 'em out, TV's, I'ma flip 'em out
Fifty bricks, that ain't shit, tell them niggas ship it out

[C-Rod]
I'm coming down shining Rose Gold, feeling like a mack pose
Cadillac with five hoes, make these suckers hate more (do ya thang)
Damn right pimp we do this every night
With the same big faces make these lame hoes bite

[Chorus]
I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)
I got the real rims (real rims) I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)

Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

[T.I.]
I'm in the hood in a drop top Super Sport
Mash let the horses holler and the Porsches follow, niggas on they porches holler (do ya thang)
They call me "Thunderbelt", comin' down in sum else
Shawty sum else, hot enough to make the summer melt

[Young Dro]
Man, I got a fruit-loop Chevy, follow me on 24's
Lucky Charm Cutlass, green diamond, purple horse go (do ya thang)
James Bonds car, drizzled as a porn star
The spring we was green, summer cutlasses are OnStar

[MacBoney]
I got a curly head dirty red broad eating Lemonheads
Leaning in the Lincoln with a pump by her left leg (do ya thang)
Looking in the tint'll get your left side bent
Leave you laid out at Lakewood by the lake bitch

[Big Kuntry King]
Color coated rims chop the streets 'til they rock up
Muscle car straight bucket, look how it stands up (do ya thang)
Yeah mane the ride look like a fruit drink
It makes these hoes thirsty when they see the pineapple paint

[Chorus]
I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)
I got the real rims (real rims) I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)
I got the real rims (real rims) I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

[Young Dro]
Baby 'Lac green, drop coupes stack cream
Earrings in my ear look like a baby flat screen (do ya thang)
I'm doing it, my neckpiece green ice
Bubbalicious purple, I'm a Grand Hustle King

[AK ]
The super-cleanest on the scene Italian leather match the polo boots
And the wood grain, lame I show you how to do the do (do ya thang)
Blowing fruit same flavor as the candy gloss
In the backseat, got a freak pulling her panties off

[MacBoney]
Errrrr made the anchor on a Cuban link chain
Diamonds stacked on top of diamonds custom made pinky rings (do ya thang)
Fishing hats Polo shorts with the Polo man
Wearing blue and tan, in a blue and tan Avalanche

[T.I.]
Jackers never had a chance, sat 'em in a ambulance
They hopped out the van and start shooting like a cameraman (do ya thang)
Top down, hit the switch and let it drop down
Passing by the Underground, they can hear me Underground

[Chorus]
I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)
I got the real rims (real rims) I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

I got that top down (top down), I got them tints down (tints down)
I got the real rims (real rims) I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)
Do ya thang (I'm doing it) do ya thang (I'm doing it)

Do ya thang
Do ya thang
