Verse 1:
Pull up, 25 grand, fat pockets, look at my pants
We too deep, look at my clan, polo clothes, look at my brand
Dro, I came here to look at yall dance
You said make it rain, so i'm kicking out grands
My partner spent 7, and my homie spent 3, i spent bout' 11
So thats 20 something g's
You ain't gotta stop and we dont wanna leave
Tip for the click put yo hand on yo knees
Nawl i ain't broke but im still on e
Roll like the mutha fucking pills on me
Real low key shaking hard for the bread
Still in school so she smart in the head
First magic city then we all at honey
Do it for the strippers making all that money
CHORUS
Verse 2
She dance for you like you dance for me
She don't handle you like she handle me
She know im caked up ride lamborghini
Shaking her stuff like tamberine
All my diamonds are tangerine
Throwing this money like dan marin
All shawty need is pampering
She'll jump when you call like a trampaline
Got my motor running like valvoline
Give me what i need and you can have the creme
My drop top chevy so apple green
These niggas in the club, they trap with me
So much money they after me
Black maserati and a strap with me
Karats on my neck call me young dro money
We can blaze up a sattle then platinum 21 it
CHORUS
Verse 3
Do it one time for the whole club geeking
Do it one time for the whole magic city
Do it one time for the girls in stroke
Bout to tell the crew gone pull up then load em
28 rolling so the chevy gonna sit up
Platinum 21 then head up get up
When we hit dreams all the girls wanna get us
Falling free money everybody with us
24 k's 24 plays, I was in the precinct for 24 days
Cajun blama, blaze'n saddle, blue frank g, the bay, it don't matter
Talking bout girls that be stacking that money
Real bitches who dont be acting that funny
Getting straight to it, and even gotta say it
Fall up in the club, start stacking that bread
CHORUS
