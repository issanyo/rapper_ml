[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Niggas try me, catch fifty first
Choppa so big nigga hit reverse
I'mma draw down on you and your partner so perfect
You gon' think this shit rehearsed
I can spit the verse but can't handle the repercussions
AK clips and Russians
Blood is rushing, cold-ass Swiss accounts
So you know the coats is Tuscan
Teddy Ruxpin, nigga, I'm a bear
Black kush, weed, nigga, put it in the air
Black mink cover up the living room chair
Chinchillas cover up my bitches over there
Westside, I can make a killing over there
Eastside, I can't pimp without Slim
Spodee on deck, can't kill it without him
Three crazy, front pocket on dip, blow

[Hook: Spodee]
I was kickin' my shit, just cooling
Bout to smoke another O
Kickin' my feet up, young nigga G'd up
Probably rollin' with your ho
Now all these folks got somethin' to say
About where I be and where I go
I heard niggas was lookin' for me
Pussy nigga, here I go
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)

[Verse 2: Shad da God & T.I.]
Probably with your bitch
Big butt, can't fit up in the Six
A hundred whole bucks'll get you two purple zips
A hundred whole bands made the AP glitch
She don't wanna fuck me, she wanna fuck my wrist
Tell her like Young Dro: "fuck that bitch"
(I said fuck that bitch) Bought a 357
Went back to the neighborhood, burnt that bitch
You niggas better go on with the buster shit
I send 50 then empty out another clip
I'm Westside ridin' my hooptie still
On the phone seeing where my little cousin is
I'm on the Southside right now
It ain't nothin' in the whip but some dope and some tools
And nigga we so deep, so don't even
If it ain't on me, I'm strapped like a fool, biatch!
I know a nigga that cut work, bitch
Ride with bricks like it's no risk
Buddy, yay cost two bands
I'm so mu'fuckin' focused
But these niggas said they G? They some pussies to me
Ten years in the game, still a rookie to me
You don't like what I'm saying? Here I'm is in your face
Right now, yeah, nigga, you ain't gotta look for me

[Hook: Spodee]
I was kickin' my shit, just cooling
Bout to smoke another O
Kickin' my feet up, young nigga G'd up
Probably rollin' with your ho
Now all these folks got somethin' to say
About where I be and where I go
I heard niggas was lookin' for me
Pussy nigga, here I go
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)

[Verse 3: Spodee]
I'm made for this
Steak and lobster, my table's dish
Been kickin' this flavor shit
No Lacoste but this 'gator, bitch (watch out, ho)
Dro is my brother from another mother
We made the clique
Me and Slim from Decatur, trick
Fuck with us, get your tater split
I spit rhymes like I'm 6'9 and my cadences
Leave pricks tryna to depict lines
Clique tryna portray this shit (bitch)
Bitch I'm big time, don't play with this
I've got six 9s, when I clip mine
Your whole clique dying, Accadians (yeah)
We the 300, nigga
If you want the ho, you'd better come and get her
It's pimpin here, I ain't no baby sitter
I've got 30 shoes with 'gator in 'em (checks)
Pussy-ass niggas so lame
Go all bare for the limelight (limelight)
Fuck what you heard
That chopper'll get a mu'fucka's mind right

[Hook: Spodee]
I was kickin' my shit, just cooling
Bout to smoke another O
Kickin' my feet up, young nigga G'd up
Probably rollin' with your ho
Now all these folks got somethin' to say
About where I be and where I go
I heard niggas was lookin' for me
Pussy nigga, here I go
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)

[Verse 4: Mystikal]
They be swinging on a trapper like a lumberjack
I'm doper than a drum full of crack
I get it popping like a lightning bolt
Yeah, motherfucker, I got my thunder back
My looks made your sister wanna ride the dick
My beats made your brother wanna bow to rap
My smoke strong, made your daddy wanna roll a blunt
Your mama holler: "Ain't nobody got time for that!"
Turn from a human to a wolf on the song (rah, rah, rah, rah...)
Bitch I rip these shows, you can ask these hoes
They be standin' in the front screaming: "We want more!"
I was at it for an hour
She couldn't catch her breath, but still she want more
After the show, I handle my motherfuckin' business
Need I say more?
T.I. sent me a song and said: "OG, merk that bitch!"
He said it real familiar, and it was real familiar
So I lit up and hurt that bitch
Give a fuck? Now wassup, give a shit, suck my dick
Give a damn, here I am - you lookin' for me, bitch?!

[Outro: Spodee]
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o
Here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o (pussy nigga, here I go)
