[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
I'm fallin' out the sky, I don't even need a parachute
If it ain't God who you suckas gon compare me to
Hoppin' in a cherry coupe, sittin' on some barry boots
Digital dash and the seats look like leather suits
Even if you rich nigga I will embarrass you
Nah I don't stunt just let my pockets punish you
Find me in the pussy club, stripper I'm the sponsor
Bet they taking off, yeah I'm floatin' like a saucer
Bossed up pimp, don't you hear them playin' the opera
Big ol' [?] up in my chain, looking very awesome
Looking for your girls homeboy you just lost em
I'm fresh to death like I'm laying in a coffin

[Hook: Big Kuntry King]

Spend a hundred racks, I do I do I do
My president is black, my Rolls Royce is blue
Polo to the floor, or catch me in a coupe
Thirty rose gold, I do I do I do

[Verse 3: T.I.]
From Monday to the weekend, whatever city we in
We go out smokin' drinkin', keep them pretty bitches freakin'
Half were Dominican, the others Puerto Rican
I'm married to the game, wedding ring on my pinky
Now players put your right hand high
Do you swear to take the game?
For better or for worse, never go out like a lame
From the cradle to the hearse, keep a pocket full of change
Never change for the fame huh, huh, huh

[Hook: Big Kuntry King]
Giovanni rims, chrome wit chrome out
Ridin' water paint, slow it slow it down
Yeah I got the pack, smokin' on that loud
Hundred band shawty, spend it to amount

[Outro: T.I.]
Say man, this for all the playas
