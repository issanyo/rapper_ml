[Intro]
I like this shit
I like your ho too, where your ho at?
Round 3, nigga
(You should've won a Nobel peace prize for this)
Ya'll don't know 'bout this shit right here, man
Know what I'm sayin'?
I was born on bankhead, fuckboy

[Verse]
Sick dro, nasty with the flow, speak corrosively
Like MLK, I got a peace prize, popped nobley
Black like history, 28 clip wit me
Niggas actin' 8 chopper-poppin' in double-ACP
Civil right activist, silver white MAC-10
Boycottin' shit, boy stop, boy coughin' him
Since I was a slave, Imma nut in white becky face
Nah, I ain't racist, but my car know how to segregate
Camaro with the white top, watch it seperate
And often, a nigga run up on me, I don't hesitate
Uh, C4 bone, watch him levitate
Huh, check my bank account, nigga hella straight, Dro!
