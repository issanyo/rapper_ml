[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Dro; that's all nigga
Car don't come out 'til fall nigga
Whoop a nigga ass with a tall nigga
Nigga we ain't stuntin' yo broads nigga
Fuck you boy you lame as hell
And them niggas came with you they lame as well
Get the fuck up out my face I got 'caine to sell
Remy in my cup I'm drunk as hell
Y'all pussy niggas just rapping wrong

[Hook:]

Pocket BK double whopper so you know they cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Every time I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me, polo polo freeze me
Polo polo freeze me, polo polo freeze me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Twenty on the watch I'm shittin' on 'em
Canary yellow chain I piss on 'em
Shawty my way she spittin on it
Told Dro this how I'm gettin on it
Drop a twelve so cold, and she comin' up poor
Copped a sub-zero cause I'm oh so cold
Four fifty-eight pass there he go
And I hit one button and the bitch get lost
Car don't come out til June nigga
Two thousand twelve, not soon nigga
Get out the way make room nigga
And the rims and the guts maroon nigga
Big tools, my whole platoon
Will wet a nigga chest like a water balloon
So you better assume what you ought to assume
Order twenty more thou', nigga, bada-bazoom
IT'S GUCCI!

[Hook:]
I get so much money man these niggas can't believe me
Pocket BK double whopper so you know they cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Every time I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me, polo polo freeze me
Polo polo freeze me, polo polo freeze me
Polo polo freeze me

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Free me see me throw the deuces hatin'

Don't trip won't slip no whoopsie daisy
See the King falling off you hallucinating'
You wanna talk about paper let do it baby

Tellin' me Margiela, not Gucci baby
Goin hard in the spot like Gucci baby
Got some true freaks with me so cute in the face
They lil' bad ass call 'em my Boosie babies

On the phone with my nigga lil' turkey saying that

[Hook:]
I get so much money man these niggas can't believe me
Pocket BK double whopper so you know they cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Every time I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me, polo polo freeze me
Polo polo freeze me, polo polo freeze me
Polo polo freeze me
