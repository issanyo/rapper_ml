[Hook: Young Dro]
Ride wit the tool-ey
Broads wanna do me
Get Fresh Louie
Iceberg goofy
Cops wanna do me
I live like a movie
6's on the dualy

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Niggas scared of me, my partners say
They begging for the chopper play
Bodyguard killers, got a house where Kevin Costner stay
Might just play some golf today
Never put the Glock away
Jackers try to 2-step I make they ass rock away
Elegant, catch me at a symphony and opera play
Paint the 'rari popper gray and blow the whole top away
No matter what the coppers say
Still move a block a day
All you niggas pop or play or lay where Jimmy Hoffa lay
Rebel outlaw, that's the same shit that Pac would say
Niggas gotta walk away, my chopper long as Dr. J
Amarilla gots to play, I might hop on the yacht today
Not today but fuck it, I'm a kill 'em in the block today

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Trans Am with the candy coat
Wait til you see the Phantom though
Spend dollars with your ho eating grapes and cantaloupe
Shawty says she wanna see me naked like D'Angelo
Guts on deck, foreplay and I'll bam a ho
I can have an' ho, I ain't want it from an' ho
Grand Hustle in the building so what you saying ho
Y'all pop new cris, We drinkin that old cris
This cost more, bitch, than '74 shit
Bankhead nigga eating octopus and swordfish
My whole clique gorgeous, say my name and forge it
Fake faggot-ass clique full of Boy Georges
They hate the team cause the yard full of Rolls Royces

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Niggas try, ain't no stoppin us, I fried 'em like tilapia
I'm mafia, talking to my German in the Boxster
President dinner bitch, a grand for the lobster
A grand for the oysters, stuffed clam and bosperch
Bitch I had 'tennas way before they had Apollo search
(???) 'for Igna man and star search
I called Kurt, found out I can rap and let 'em all hurt
Several years later I'm the nigga in the tall vert
Section 8 killer, man all I need is yard work
Hard work, flatland Adamsville dog work
Bet you ran to see me cause my Chevy look like Starburst
Get your feelings 'n all hurt, wait til ya see the fall vert

[Hook x2]
