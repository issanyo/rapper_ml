I miss grandmomma (Maggie), I miss Joshua, Poncho I never forgot ya, plus they killed Tasha
On top of that I got shot up, and guess who did it, my patna
Askin' God is it probably okay if he could just wash it away, see the expression that I got on my face
See the weapon that I got on my waist, I'm still trippin'
Momma I'm still slippin', pray for me and wait for me, as soon as you and my daughter get richer, these days for
Me and T.I. made a way for me, and Jason had a place for me, Doug on the case with me, plus Hannah been makin' me straight

[Verse 2]
I never talked about this but now is the time
I tried to let it go but this shit destroyed my mind
My homie, his momma dyin', and his baby daughter she blind
She got no one to play with nothin' but a daughter that's mine
I'm be takin' more than time Lord hurry they killed Brian
And plus they killin' kids hurry up before they kill mine
Killin time, lately it's a funeral, I'm soon to go
Young Dro bless me, in peace and look at the moon blow
Thinkin' bout when daddy got high and I had my room closed
Broke, I can't survive winter wearing these June clothes
Blooms slow uprooted flower in dying hours, the water goin' off but I'm cool my tears shower me

[Chorus]
Hear me cry it's like Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm
Hear the shots they like boom boom boom
Heads howl at the moon moon moon
And when we die it's like soon, soon, soon
Hear me cry it's like Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm
Hear the shots they like boom boom boom
Heads howl at the moon moon moon
And when we die it's like soon, soon, soon

[Verse 3]
I'm finna cry man, call Quantay, this shit hurt (forreal)
Tip call Donshae, tell him that I meant for one day for us to make this shit
Shit shawty shot me up I couldn't take it, plus I had to wear a shitbag but I forgave him
He shot me, but God helped me fly off like a raven, don't hate him, pray for him, Zay Zay made a way for him, my homeboy died, yeah he was a atheist
All I got is faith pimp and money from the 70s, all kind of felonies, playa like Bill Bellamy
Ima go to heaven nigga fuck what ya'll tellin' me, fuck it Ima stop rappin' shawty sang this hear

(Pause)
Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm

Heads howl at the moon moon moon
And when we die it's like soon, soon, soon
Hear me cry it's like Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm
Hear the shots they like boom boom boom
Heads howl at the moon moon moon
And when we die it's like soon, soon, soon
