[Pre-hook: Young Dro]
Turn it
Bitch pop it, get cheddar
Stupid ice (Water, water)
Louboutins  on my feet (fleet, fleet)
Baller, baller
Ferragamo Gucci Louis (Pressure, pressure, pressure)
I can brick it, I can flip it (Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir)

[Chorus: London Jae]
I got two bitches wit me and it going my way
I got two pistols on me and I'm gunning my way
On a perk and a [??] gettin' mo' [??]
Got it made in the shade, gettin' money my way

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Gettin' brain in the Chevy while the motor runnin'
In the club on the gas, smell it all up on me
Bitch back up on me, got that Rollie on me
Tell your partner quit watchin', got the .40 on me
Then pop a dose, eatin' gator every day
Benihana wit' lil mama, double white steak
In a Tesla, blowin' pressure, bumpin' [??] King
Martin Luther King, I'm Mr. everything
Sunset Road, I got hoes, red bottom toes
I got hoes in the fall, they're my autumn hoes
Every week switch the paint, that's the baller code
Chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper
Sneeze, wiping nose
Dro pop and get cheddar

[Pre-Hook: Young Dro]
Bitch pop it, get cheddar
Stupid ice (Water, water)
Louboutins  on my feet (fleet, fleet)
Baller, baller
Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis (Pressure, pressure, pressure)
I can brick it, I can flip it (Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir)

[Chorus: London Jae]
I got two bitches wit me and it going my way
I got two pistols on me and I'm gunning my way
On a perk and a [??] gettin' mo' [??]
Got it made in the shade, gettin' money my way

[Verse 2: Young dro]
Range Rover, take my truck in a safari
Test the roads with the 'Rari
My lil' bitch look like Barbie
Fuck Ruth's Chris, we go to Hardee's
Sniper rifle, don't start me
Voice-activate Benz, no car key
Clean whip, same color Bacardi
I'm riding round bumpin' Paul McCartney
Oysters, large squids, shark meat
I'm saucy and I'm elegant bitch, pardon me
I'm really a killer, thriller manilla
Look how I did 'em, come to a world Basquait art meet
I'm really a chief, what kind of beef you want with Dro?
Like Arby's, we got all the meats
Thousand round, .50 cal take out all your peeps
Sometimes [?]
I'm bustin' a special tech, special broad
Shorty got special neck
Special number 8, section that
Me and mama on welfare, my homeboy [?]
Free my niggas in Jackson by Andrew Jackson
Hancock, haters, what's happenin'?
Said my [?] say "what's happenin'?"
Real [?], let it breathe again, Braxton, Toni

[Pre-Hook: Young Dro]
Bitch pop it, get cheddar
Stupid ice (Water, water)
Louboutins  on my feet (fleet, fleet)
Baller, baller
Ferragamo, Gucci, Louis (Pressure, pressure, pressure)
I can brick it, I can flip it (Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir)

[Chorus: London Jae]
I got two bitches wit me and it going my way
I got two pistols on me and I'm gunning my way
On a perk and a [??] gettin' mo' [??]
Got it made in the shade, gettin' money my way

[Outro: Young Dro]
Gettin' brain in the Chevy while the motor runnin'
In the club on the gas, smell it all up on me
Bitch back up on me, got that Rollie on me
Tell your partner quit watchin', got the .40 on me
