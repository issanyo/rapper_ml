[Intro: [?]]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Paint the ceiling witcha feelings, sway your city with my thoughts
Guess I'm too much of a criminal, I'm a villain wit' a cause
Seem like every time I talk I set a million missiles off
Donald Sterling: My opinions piss a million niggas off
This a million nigga mob, it's a generation lost
Give a fuck who sleeping on me, I don't speak no pillow talk
They don't hear me, they don't hear me, shit, I guess the signal lost
This is me against the world, fuck, consider this a draw
Guess I'm too misunderstood, picking licks on this guitar
Well if Bobby Ray too country, I'm the black Tim McGraw
Got some shit up on my chest, and I can't wait to get it off
If it's trouble that they looking for, I give 'em what they want (Bands)

[Chorus: Watch the Duck]
(Struggle)
Never should they test me now
You say you want some when you know you ain't want no
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
You don't want no problem
And no man shall ever back me down
You say you want some when you really know you don't want no
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
You don't want no problem

[Verse 2: T.I., & Young Dro]
The [?] kid, not born in the gutter, (born in the gutter)
My cousin and my brother, (my cousin and my brother)
And my other little cousin, ten years straight and we're waiting on my uncle
Wasn't no trouble, we had to hustle
Bought that work, yeah, had to double
What we do, nigga, we do great
Even if not, nigga, we'll do bad together
Hey, from worse and all, (worse and all)
From bad to better, (better)
I told my folk if they ever get on, we gonna get care forever (forever)
And that's on my daddy, nigga
You remember me when I was a crack dealer and had a cap healer,[?]
Now a nigga trapped wherever get 850 cause he wrap dope
Ain't gonna see no trap nigga knock no more money too slow
Nigga, there for me
You're like someone with a hundred keys trying to live off two o's[?]
And you know, that I ain't with the drama[?]
Because I'm about the ashy
Meet me nigga, you don't want no problem

[Chorus: Watch the Duck, & Young Dro]
(Struggle)
Never should they test me now
You say you want some when you know you ain't want no
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
You don't want no problem, (You can't take what I can dish out man, I promise)
And no man shall ever back me down, (Nobody, ever)
You say you want some when you really know you don't want no
(Fuck you, bitch, you too)
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
(Make me a believer, kill me now, nigga)
You don't want no problem

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
Yeah, I'm fire like Bic, I've got the butane
Thick head [?] nigga, with holes in Ukraine [?]
Fuck your bitch [?], and fuck your rules [?]
A hundred dollar line as fast as you say [?]
I hit the gas on your ass 'cause you lame [?]
Your ass will get tamed
I'm Dro, Hannibal Lector, watch me eat half of his brain
With a bottle of [?], five of these [?]
She don't think in no country [?]
I bet she'll get played like a banjo, [?]
I'm the middle son [?], got the whole money [?]
Head on two [?], the things will get loose [?], or nah
Balling in the money in spring, the summer, or fall
And then pummel the horse real big, the same to me [?]
[?], beat by the benz, the eyes are like [?]
You're a tadpole nigga, an asshole nigga [?]
I'll kill you in the backbone, nigga [?]
I'll knock your ass out the margin
Now ain't homeless, but I'll bet that bitch [?]
I got heartburn, too much on the floor [?]
I got wrecks like Dolly Parton [?]
That's Dro [?]

[Chorus: Watch the Duck]
(Struggle)
Never should they test me now
You say you want some when you know you ain't want no
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
You don't want no problem
And no man shall ever back me down
You say you want some when you really know you don't want no
(Trouble) trouble, yeah
You don't want no problem
