If I Was A Nigga Yall Bitches Would Be On My Dick

[Dro:]
You Kno How Tried Me Its The Principle
I Am So Difficult
My Life Is Irresistable
They Judge Me In Municiple
State Court Lawyers Make Drug Cases Fixable
Million Dollas Every Year, Grand Hustle

Now Models Are Kissable
Diamonds Are Wristable
The Finger On My Wrist Is Blue
Im The Only Nigga That A Bunch Of People Listen Too
They Tell Me That Im Lyrical
I Promise Em A Miracle
Spiritual
Even Though My Conditions Are Critical
Devil ain't see-able
But God made him hearable
Lord I Am Fearable
Im Hard But Im Terrible
SS Impala Ride Out Deer-able
Wood Grain Steering Wheel
The Porshe Truck Is Tear Blue
