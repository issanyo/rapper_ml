[Intro: Pharrell Williams/DJ Drama]
The yellows is real
The whites is clean, y'know what I'm sayin'?
The blues is monster, I mean it's...
The Laffy Taffy chain, haha y'know what I'm sayin'?
When I rock it, start laughin'

In My Mind's coming soon
But in the meantime we have some other shit to handle
Skateboard P been paying a lot of dues
And I don't know if y'all niggas been paying attention
Well if not, this is what I'mma do for 'em
DJ Drama, AMG

This that music for the gangsta

Star Trak
Ill

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
This that music for the most realest
Blow dealers who by the way are Mo' spillers
Surrounded by go-rillas
Yeah, it's Skateboard, over trap or die
From Virginia AKA Hustler's Paradise
But don't get it twisted they be kidnappin' guys
Caught you slippin' your fault, the un-mastered eye
The only mathematic, is drug traffa-ic
Get it cook it cut it, nigga then wrap it quick
Get yourself a white one get your man a matching six
The white is calling "Hip-hop", but they can't rap or lick
Niggas tryna case 'em, the Feds is tryna chase 'em
But they got it all designed like the mind of a Mason
Fresh Ice Creams I know you ain't plan to fall
Turn that white tee red like Santa Claus
It's almost sacrilegious, the way they practice business
We call it package-risen the way that drug wakes up the dead
Just for sports cars, lipstick red, on chrome deep dishes
The face of the rim is red like Swedish Fishes
Put the car and the rims together and get the sweetest kisses
Clear your head for a second, leave the weed restricted
I know you think I'm rappin' fly but I know niggas that rap and fly
Why, I rap in fly jets bangin' that trap or die
I'm a great rapper, right?

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Young Dro, check it, Young Dro, aye
I could turn time a day back
I could whip open brain Maybach
Play that, I am a Yugoslavia killer
German bricks I am a Yugoslavia killer, painkiller
Blue green chevy, navy seal marine ready
Dope chain color spaghetti
You know, off white, move the yay
Fly first super great
.45 caliber to your chest, super pray
Fruit whips, deuce trey, doctor blow my roof away
Chopper in each torpedo, doctor blow your roof away
I hustle where I used to stay
(I ain't gon ?)
Ice white grape
White grape jays
Light grey [?]
Spice AKs
Dice for eight days
Ocean black waves
Ocean green Jaguar
Photo black 'yays
Told her black Day's
Mercedes 900 nigga fuck a 500
Big rocks in my ear look like mustard time donâ€™t it
Oh that rhyme don't it
Gotta believe us
Frigerator rocks
I was born in the freezer aye, I was born in the freezer

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Clips fully loaded, and the Jesus stacks
You can keep the baking soda, ain't no need for that
Cook crack money fast, off-white money long
Ballin' boy home till all the money gone
.40 cal leave you numb like you bumped your funny bone
The fuck you laughing for it ain't a damn thing funny holmes
We living the dangerous life
I could show you the skull and bones
Smooth as Frank Sinatra but gangster like Al Capone
And all the shit that we done, whether we proud of it or not
Speaking loud of it or not
I take a scoop out the block and then drop it into the pot
Distribute it to the block, its easy believe it or not
Niggas come all shapes and size with pistols and even the modest
Plain to see eagles shot but nobody speaking to cops
The seized the gun dropped, squeeze but none stopped
We miss them, double back and and kill them all in one wop nigga
