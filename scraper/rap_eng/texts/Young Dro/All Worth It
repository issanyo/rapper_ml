[Intro: Derez De'Shon & Young Dro]
I hope it's all worth it, you feel me
Yeah
We gon' get through this shit though
Dro, Derez De'Shon

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Only time I see my children 'nem is on FaceTime
You make time for what you want, I try to make time
I got niggas doin' feds and doin' state time
I just hope that it's worth it, I hope it was all worth it
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
I swear a funeral and a life sentence the same thing
'Cause I feel the same pain
I lost some niggas to the street, lost some niggas to the chain gang
Every time I nigga chain swing, all I think about is Dunk we did it
All I'm wishin' is that Dunk was with me (Dunk we did it)
Fuck up prescriptions and numb my feels
Fucked with niggas that I shouldn't have fucked with
Trusted niggas that I shouldn't have trusted
Fell in love with bitches I shouldn't have loved, yeah
Hey, I ain't no 'grets (got no regrets)
I got a check (I got a check)
Diamond my neck (diamond my neck)
Ice on my wrist, look at my kicks (look at my kicks)
Swear I do the best (swear I do the best)
It is what it is
I just hope it's all worth it
Lord know I'm far from perfect

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Young Dro]
Only time I see my children 'nem is on FaceTime
You make time for what you want, I try to make time
I got niggas doin' feds and doin' state time
I just hope that it's worth it, I hope it was all worth it
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I just hope it's all worth it, stack the money on purpose
Swear to God we got curses, I just hope it's all worth it, yeah
I just hope it's all worth it, stack the money on purpose
Swear to God we got curses, I just hope it's all worth it, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Stand over on feelings, copped a coupe with no ceiling
All I know is drug dealing, real niggas gotta feel it
I'm tryna hold back these tears, instead of try stack these hundreds
I'm facin' 'bout thirty-five years, who gon' take care my mama, yeah
Lookin' in the eyes of my lil daughter
Catch you down bad, pull out the forty
Percocets make me feel like a boss
Shake somethin', I'm a skinny Rick Ross
Wipe a nigga nose, takin' him off
Rockin' uncs and rockin' the cross
Don't know which way to go, fuck it I'm lost
Killin' it, dealin' it, spillin' it, drillin' it
Adderall boostin' up my adrenaline
Jack paint, man that shit look like cinnamon
I been thuggin' hard ever since Kimberly
I want to change but it take time
Only see my kids on FaceTime
If I want it I make time
I just hope it's all worth it

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Young Dro]
Only time I see my children 'nem is on FaceTime
You make time for what you want, I try to make time
I got niggas doin' feds and doin' state time
I just hope that it's worth it, I hope it was all worth it
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I just hope it's all worth it, stack the money on purpose
Swear to God we got curses, I just hope it's all worth it, yeah
I just hope it's all worth it, stack the money on purpose
Swear to God we got curses, I just hope it's all worth it, yeah
