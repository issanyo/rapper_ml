Niggas try me, catch fifty first
Choppa so big nigga hit reverse
I'mma draw down on you and your partner so perfect
You gon' think this shit rehearsed
I can spit the verse but can't handle the repercussions
AK clips and Russians
Blood is rushing, cold-ass Swiss accounts
So you know the coats is Tuscan
Teddy Ruxpin, nigga, I'm a bear
Black kush, weed, nigga, put it in the air
Black mink cover up the living room chair
Chinchillas cover up my bitches over there
Westside, I can make a killing over there
Eastside, I can't pimp without Slim
Spodee on deck, can't kill it without him
Three crazy, front pocket on dip, blow

[Hook: Young Dro]
I was kickin' my shit, just cooling, 'bout to smoke another O
Kickin' my feet up, young nigga G'd up, probably rollin' with your ho
Now all these folks got somethin' to say about where I be and where I go
I heard niggas was lookin' for me, pussy nigga, here I go
Here I go, here I go (pussy nigga, here I go)
Here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Probably with your bitch - big butt, can't fit up in the Six
A hundred whole bucks'll get you two purple zips
A hundred whole bands made the AP glitch
She don't wanna fuck me, she wanna fuck my wrist
Tell her like Young Dro: "fuck that bitch" (I said fuck that bitch)
Bought a 357, went back to the neighbourhood, bought that bitch

[Verse 3: Weeshlow.]
You niggas better go on with the buster shit
I send 50 then empty out another clip
I'm Westside ridin' my hooptie still
On the phone seeing where my little cousin is
(I'm on the Southside right now)
(It ain't nothin' in the whip but some dope and some tools)
And nigga we so deep, so don't even
If it ain't on me, I'm strapped like a fool, biotch!
(I know a nigga that cut work, bitch)
(Ride with bricks like it's no risk)
(Buddy, yay cost two bands)
I'm so ma'fuckin' focussed
But these niggas said they G?
They some pussies to me
Ten years in the game, still a rookie to me
You don't like what I'm saying?
Hail Marys in your face right now
Yeah, nigga, you ain't gotta look for me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Shad da God]
I'm made for this - steak and lobster, my table's dish
Been kickin' this flavour shit
No Lacoste but this 'gator, bitch (watch out, ho)
Dro is my brother from another mother, we made the clique
Me and Slim from Decatur, trick
Fuck with us, get your tater split
I spit rhymes like I'm 6'9 and my cadences
Leave pricks tryna to depict lines
Clique tryna portray this shit (bitch)
Bitch I'm big time, don't play with this
I've got six 9s, when I clip mine
Your whole clique dying, Arcadians (yeah...)
We the 300, nigga
If you want the ho, you'd better come and get her
It's pimpin here, I ain't no baby sitter
I've got 30 shoes with 'gator in 'em (checks)
Pussy-ass niggas so lame, go all bare for the limelight (limelight)
Fuck what you heard, that chopper'll get a ma'fucka's mind right
