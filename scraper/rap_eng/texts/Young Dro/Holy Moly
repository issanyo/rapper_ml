[Hook: Phay]
Okie-dokie,  what the hell they sayin' Dro?
Rollie-pollie, 'bout that time we said somethin'
Head dumb, I don't think she read nothin'
Throw it up, zone six to zone one
Holy moly, I can smell the bread crumbs
Holy moly, throw it out, the feds comin'
Holy moly, devil in the Red Phantom
Holy moly, heaven for the dead homies (yeah)
Holy moly (hey)
Holy moly, holy moly (holy moly)
Holy moly
Holy moly (ah)
Holy moly, holy moly (holy moly)
Holy moly

[Verse 1: Phay]
Betta know my flow gonna catch the Holy Ghost
So hit the floor
And shake it hoe
And I got this hoe, she such bird
'Cause she so goddamn pigeon toed
Thick ass hoe
And I'm rollin' dro with Dro
And you should know that I don't ever smoke
But pass the dope
I'ma pastor with the sermon
Catch it like I'm Sherman, it's a go
Eddie Bishop? No!
And I'm Pistol Petey, never greedy
Double D me
Pick and roll
And I give and go
And I'm rappin' with my idols
Swear to God I put it on the Bible
I'ma kill em though
But I know that Grand Hustle got the muscle
Steady flexin' hoe
R.I.P. to Doe
Better know I'm thirsty for that Hershey
Something like the desert doe
Drinking cameltoe

[Interlude: Phay]
Rubber band bangs, boyoyoy
Shoulder lean with it, Drooo
Back back fuck, boyoyoy
Dro loud making noioioise
Rubber band bangs, boyoyoy
Shoulder lean with it, Drooo
Back back fuck, boyoyoy
Dro loud making noioioise

Holy moly (hey)
Holy moly, holy moly (holy moly)
Holy moly
Holy moly (ah)
Holy moly, holy moly (holy moly)
Holy moly

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Purple Cutlass, purple buttons
Purple lean, Robitussin
Purple house, purple chopper
Purple work, purple pound
Yellow Benz, yellow money
Yellow sun, yellow hunnies
Aqua brighter, Aqua Spriter (oh)
Aqua pussy, aqua diver
Gold Loubit's, gold Guccis
What the baby wear?
Gold booties
Fuchsia rocks, Fuchsia Crocs
Fuchsia Polo, Fuchsia socks
This jacket? Illfish
Stingray, feel this
Mister Dabo, Rocky Balbo' (Adrian!)
(Urghaurgh)
Fifty caliber, the fish is halibut
I'm benevolent
I'm pressing celibate
Don't fuck with me brethren!
I worry the words
David Letterman
You, I'm better than
Take some Excedrin
Deal with the headache
I'm in a straight 8
I am on Hamilton
A JJ with KK
No no like a payday
Fuck it, I'm ready
The Benz is Ragu
No, that's spaghetti
