[Hook: GFMBRYYCE]
Boomin', buckin', mind your business

Dime trappin', I'm the captain, no cappin', I'm the greatest ever did it
Who finna check me, who gonna check me fucker
I got the check, so who finna check me
Who gon' check me now
Dime trappin' all day tell 'em check it out
Who gon' check me now
Dime trappin' all day tell 'em check it out

[Verse 1: TIP]
Secure the bag, split it with my niggas five ways
Now I'm out the dealership sideways
Pull up in your driveway, on a friday, my compadre
I (?), baby ready if you start it
I got bales on a dolly, at the disco, shittin' bobby yeah
White hoes in my bathroom doing lines like a polygraph
Spanish bitch with molly she like how I make her body feel
Black girls just be smokin' drinkin' lean poppin' percocets
Take a clean (?)
Pourin', excitement needed, emergency
All the time I'm ridin' nigga
Talk down I be just firing
If your hoe fine, i will go try
Slap her on the ass like it's go time lil bitch

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dime trappin', I'm a captain, ain't no captain, make these niggas start cappin'
Straight dabbin' in the latest fashion, stupid lyrics made me start rappin'
Straight drop with the yola, I got bricks in Pensacola
I got hoes up in Tennessee, and some bitches in the Nolia
Stupid head from your main broad, shawty got some insane top
Man, her head so good make a nigga milly rock in his tank top
Dro trappin' outta Bangkok
Show a nigga how to Bangkok?????????????
In the whip I'm a Migo
Drop top while the rain drop
Big (?) standing outside
Chopper drone sitting outside
Nigga in the car talkin' shit, we'll blow his ass out the ride
Re-up get some more white
Fuck around get your new wife
White bitch look like Snow white
Pow pow, for the full pipe

[Verse 3: Translee]
Gotta say the boy the illest
Ain't no cure for my sickness
Big smoke behind a gang member, did in on the Hustle Gang business
Got the forty when I'm down in Houston, and I make it sing like Whitney
My bitch trippin' bout the shit I'm sippin'
She like baby you fuckin' up your kidneys

[Verse 4: Yung Booke]
Hop out the bentley I don't got a suit on, but I came to handle my business
Fuck how you feeling, and how you coming (?)
Put it on him, answer the front door like e Jehova's witness
They diggin' I'm dippin', dippin' and dabbin' in brand new Givenchy

I used to slang that ghetto d like Master P yah
