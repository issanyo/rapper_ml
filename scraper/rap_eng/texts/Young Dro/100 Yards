[Hook: Young Dro:]
All we make is cash, Straight drop glass
Nigga try to play me, we'll straight drop ass
Trunk on blast and our cars go fast
Choppa make a nigga do a 100 yard daaaash

[Verse 1: Young Dro:]
Ima bankhead veteran
Got em takin eccederin
Them suckas caught headaches when they saw me on David Letterman
Ride round severan, off the heads(bankhead & buckhead) to my bretheren
Man this gangsta picture been on Paul Wall ever since
I was young wit medicine
Now im in the yellow bent
Thought the shit was lame, das why I ain't go and get the yellow tint
Tell em kent
We ride phantoms supplyin anthems
Body full of reptile camo's and fine pampers
Shine amper, fox fur
Submarine boxster
Kill a nigga ass on time, they call me clockster
Lightskin mossberg, not the black but the chrome one
26 davins, the black back with the chrome front

[Hook: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, Straight drop glass
Nigga try to play me, we'll straight drop ass
Trunk on blast and our cars go fast
Choppa make a nigga do a 100 yard daaaash

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Aye look, Brasco Astro
Big shipment in the van, dead fresh nigga plaid put on castro
Give em what they ask for, 20 thousand in sacks
Stand on the trap till I see the damn task force
Come back in a black porche,(who?) Me and Bola
This Xtaci time, when the sunshines its over
White cola, systems are metric, force is sucessive
Ain't no choice, I'm aggressive
My brauds walk on giseptics and nati
Mark Jacobs in the maple Marzarati
I'm rich, nothin to do, So I'm taking up karate
I'm taping up my body like the NFL quarterback
Michael Vick shit, tell em to bring a quarter back

[Hook: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, Straight drop glass
Nigga try to play me, we'll straight drop ass
Trunk on blast and our cars go fast
Choppa make a nigga do a 100 yard daaaash

[Verse 3: Xtaci]
Bitch please, Shawty I know u ain't got these
Varagomas on my face and some juicy gatore jeans
Bitch I'm ballin wit some pimps who be lettin they shoulda lean
Know them grills gone bling
And them banks go $chiiing$
Listen, Ima queen, 5 karat ring
See through blouse and my nipples ain't seen
Everybody know that I'm quick to beat a hoe ass
In a quick flash, make them bitches hit the floor fast
Drop top, in the other seat, I got plenty cash
Always first class, Bitch I was made to last
You a old rag still stuntin wit a coach bag
Young fly bitches like to ride wit the beat blast

[Hook: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, Straight drop glass
Niggas try to play me, we'll straight drop ass
Trunk on blast and our cars go fast
Choppa make a nigga do a 100 yard daaaash
