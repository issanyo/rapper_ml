Forecast determines high chance of a heavy shower
Getcha umbrella

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 1: Young Dro]

I see'em
Groupie bitches fallin like rain
This bitch like my chain
This bitch like my ring
Who's gonna suck my thang?
Beez all at my hotel
Tell them im in room 112
Bitch im really in 110
(So you lied to dem hoes?)
Fuck yeah!
Anytime i think you hoes tryna race me
Really them bitches tryna chase me
And yesterday i was finna call the police
(Why?)
Dem hoes tried to rape me (911!)
Ima fresher then a spring time sunflower
Fuckin these bitches on lunch hours
Nigga try me bout one of these hoes
Yall gone smell a whole bunch of gun powder
Dis ho, dat ho
She can go, she can't
Bitch you a lil bit to baldhead
And yo homegirl breath- three stank
Ridin through the hood with a bank roll
Pass this out to my stank ho
Trinidad James say the ones who be really the groupies
Be the ones say they ain't doe

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Fallin like rain, water
Take a step back you can see dem (drip)
G-girl don't get mad just cause you suck, rip
She don't smoke but my swisher she chief it
She got a good brain that will make her a genius Tho it ain't no secret
This Dick is the cleanest
These hoes could have more diseases than Prometheus
Gross, don't get close
Bobby Ray that boy mac a dosh
Her name Porsha but she never drove a Porsche
Like a motor imma fuck her with the power of a horse
Now that's force, that's torque
Eighteen holes lookin like a golf course
From Dominicans and even them Brazilians
And I ain't even hit'em man I'm talkin all sorts
If these niggas saw the sides of the women I see
Maybe niggas wouldn't be committed to she
She got a man she ain't mention to me
Maybe what she doin it ain't meant to be seen
But if I had a daughter
I would tell her from the start
To keep you loved and keep you gaurded
Cause you don't wanna grow up whole hearted
Hollerin niggas ain't shit
But ain't at the end of the night you alone and a groupie, bitch

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Them bitches said they heard about me
Fall finger ring down ya side, nay
Southside dick slinging cowboy named James
Yippy kai yay better hide yo bitch
Me and Bobby Ray off in this bitch
Dats Southside and the deck
And her mouth wide for this dick, woah
Let me flex, (ha!) let me flex
Thirty hoes in my section, give a molly, watch em sweat, (woo!)
Let me flex, let me flex
See yo ho in my section
Best ta believe fuck it next
I took her down to dat twelve
She said what about my friend?
That's two more on my shelf
Never call them again
Now back out on dat scene
Yes, Lord, yours truly!
I can't date dem regular ho, I need groupies
Bitch!

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Outro: Young Dro}

One thing about it, you can't stop the rain
There's or ours, to much for you niggas
Day Two
