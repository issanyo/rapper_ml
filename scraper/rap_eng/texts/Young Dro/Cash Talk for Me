[Intro]
Just tryna make that cash talk
When the feds come
When the feds come, that cash talk
When the feds come
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off of me

[Chorus]
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off of me

[Verse 1]
I don't want nothing but peanut butter and jelly
Me and Young Thug, bleeding, ridin' heavy
Nigga this a red super wine Chevy
I got Jamaican hoes, [??], Belly
Dro, he whipping that Aston Martin, Nelly
Leather coat [?], back in the day [?]
VVS soft, nigga paid in full, Pirelli's
Mason Margiela make a hater feel jealous
All my nigga move block, oo, Tetris
Ha, nigga we don't want your plug, we're connected
Yeah, FN, gold pump bullets go through vest's
Ha, and if you wanna deal with them feds here's a lesson
(Yeah, what you do?)

[Chorus]
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off of me
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off of me

[Verse 2]
My bitch look just like Ginger on Casino
My steering wheel on the right side of my bitch, Filipino
Spend 25,000 on the Louis, show 'em how to be a baller, nigga Ochocinco
Polo, cars, push engine start, do it fresh to death, no wrinkles
Ya'll pussy ass niggas better [?] with my lingo
And boy you better get your chick before I cancel this bitch like Nino (Hold up, hold up)
Cancel that bitch like Nin-Dro
Cancel that bitch like Nino
(What you do?)

[Chorus]
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off of me
When the feds come, when the feds come for me
That cash talk, that cash talk for me
Shawty can you make that ass talk for me
Little bitch tell your broke ass boyfriend back off
