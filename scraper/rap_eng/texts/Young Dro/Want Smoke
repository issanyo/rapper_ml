[Intro: T.I.]
Man, aye
It's really like Hustle Gang everything
I don't want no peon round me
Only bosses in my clique, you know what I'm saying?
Get your own shit, run the bag, yo niggaa

[Chorus]
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got money
(Boy, you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got power
(Fuck you, niggaa, you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got respect
(Hey shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, aye

[Post-Chorus]
Anyway, what you gonna say?
Foreign boo in our ride, we just gon' run and play
My bitch is foreign, get your cake up
(But you know you don't want no smoke)
Hustle Gang over everything, shorty you know you don't want no smoke
(Shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)

[Verse 1: Dro]
This is a rap, this is a trap
That's lame hoe, she volunteered in the camp
They call me Dro, this a four four
I'm with a out of town broad, she don't go-go
Stick like a cactus, blow you off the atlas
Run upon you with that Draco
I got my ratchet and I'm rockin' Coogi
Don't make me act a fool, don't make me unload this uzi
I go for the kick, I die for the kick, get money
We saw light on the haze, I shoot 'em the back of the face
I be the first nigga that's catching a case
I stalk through the hood, get a QP, I'm so G
You can not do me, I'm a certified gangsta
And I'm sponsored by Louis and Ralph
And I'm on they tanner, make them pull them bands out
Make her only stand out, man, what the plan now
Keys in my hand, thirty bricks up in the van now
Fuck you saying now, me and T.I.P. gon' cash out

[Chorus]
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got money
(But you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got power
(Fuck you, niggaa, you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got respect
(Hey shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, aye

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Still do it, like I'm still broke
Still do it like I'm still in center hill rollin'
Bankhead , Zone one
And I know it
Ship it in here like a fake cake
He's making me a head-case, I think he Fed, bae
You sayin' he your homeboy, I say he dead weight
No doubt about it, man I bought a new Bentley just so I can be proud about it
Knew it from the beginning that beginning, handle my business
Get all your money and do your time if you get it
Play your position and play dumb as a witness
Stay reminiscing bout Cap , Philant & Trenches
Jab it and double Tramel and Bankroll
R.I.P., O-G-D free meek, free Roscoe too, Long Live King Troop
Multi millionaires still robbin
Make you Feel it in the Air Tonight like Phil Collins
Here it coming, pull on you with your side bitch like we got problems
Pistol better not be where you're riding
You drove all the way and put it on a side bitch
You mean a doe hoe in the red Bentley truck for Saturday, yeah

[Chorus]
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got money
(But you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got power
(Fuck you, niggaa, you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got respect
(Hey shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, see

[Verse: ]
Full money and power, niggas gonna respect you regardless
Fell sleep last night when I was alone in the car
Whole army of shooters and Wassi's the sergeant
Too hot, you've gotta blow it like a sacred cartridge
Hey, I'm a giant, y'all real small, I cut my hands off before I fear y'all
You suckers ain't trillville
My chrome still will get to singin' like Johnny Gil
Nigga, get it how you live it in the street for real
Not the industry, that's the difference
P gang no sure for hanging, I bet you did
Demanding my respect, niggas dropping, they gon' get it
I don't just rap about it, my city'll tell you that I live it [?]

[Chorus]
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got money
(But you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got power
(Fuck you, nigga, you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, we got respect
(Hey shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
And we got what these niggas ain't got, aye
[?]
(But you know you don't want no smoke)
[?]
(Shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
[?]
(Hey shorty, you know you don't want no smoke)
