[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Uh

Purp? I don't smoke that nigga (Straight kush nigga)
Oh you want some of this money?

[Hook: Young Dro]
Fuck these niggas man they ain't got none of my swag (Nope)

That bitch you fuckin' ain't bad
Y'all ain't seein' my clique

[Hook: Young Dro]
Fuck these niggas man they ain't got none of my swag (Nope)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
45 rounds in the clip, .45 in the whip, fuck around, think I'm playin' with you
Ho tell the dead nigga "Talk shit 'bout a bitch", but the bitch ain't shit I ain't lie nigga

Hustle Gang over everything, Police pull up on me, ask me have I seen anything? (Nope)
Known world wide, in the trees smoke 'n' ride, in the coupe these bad bitches never say (Nope)
Felicia tell you what she won't do, but for me she want to
What's the difference, man you already (know)
Hey don't run up on me rappin' 'bout you used to bang too
Slang blo, kick rocks I don't believe it nigga

And you don't wanna feud with my family pull a jammy on your mammy, what your little survey say
I got a bunch of young wildin' niggas with me running wild in the city, they were tryin' to go for [?] day

While I wake up everyday look in the mirror as it is and anybody anywhere who can't fuck with us
(That's what he said)
