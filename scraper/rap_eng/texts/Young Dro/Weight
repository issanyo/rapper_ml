Whoa

[Chorus]
That's too much weight on me
Uh, I've been dealin' with the load
I've been fuckin' with them hoes
Are you friend or you foes?
I don't know
That's too much weight on me
Propaganda all the way in Atlanta
It get real when they stamp ya
Can't wait for the money 'cause the money don't wait on me

[Hook]
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya, ya-a
Wait
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya-a, ya, ya
Don't wait on me

[Verse]
Well respected, no one to shit, no
Boss shit, you see me point, well then you better get down
Pop sold dope, hit the weight on the way
Had to go and get it, couldn't wait on the plate
Mistakes on the plate
Blang, blang on the brace
Gang bang on the case 'cause I stated my case
Only church boy with the thing on my waist
Gotta feed the fam
All my kin kids straight
You know pressure made the diamond
Clique still grindin'
Made it through the struggle
Closer to the silver linin'
Charged up Duracell and the Energizer
So I can't sympathize ya, I gotta minimize ya
Now how you gonna act?
Ain't even got a rearview
No we ain't goin' back
Stay down for flex

Playground with the swing
Put a nigga out to ring
Plus we fuckin' with the king
We ain't waitin' for a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
That's gonna mean
I've been dealin' with the load
I've been fuckin' with them hoes
Are you friend or you foes?
I don't know
That's too much weight on me
Propaganda all the way in Atlanta
It get real when they stamp ya
Can't wait for the money 'cause the money don't wait on me

[Hook]
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya, ya-a
Wait
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya-a, ya, ya

[Verse]
Yeah, oh, man, I'm propaganda
I'm the truth up out Atlanta
Mink black and white panda
Still salamander sandals
Some of my bitches is common
Got pimpin' in Puni Hana
New pimp on the droid
And I better get this number
And I'm throwin' these bricks like Cunningham, Randel
And I be up in the kettle with the dope
Me and L O
Since you think a nigga country, I'ma play you like a banjo
I'm smoking Cohiba's overseas my plug Santos
Dro

[Chorus]
I've been dealin' with the load
I've been fuckin' with them hoes
Are you friend or you foes?
I don't know
That's too much weight on me
Propaganda all the way in Atlanta
It get real when they stamp ya
Can't wait for the money 'cause the money don't wait on me

[Hook]
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya, ya-a
Wait
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya-a, ya, ya
Don't wait on me

[Verse]
In the drop down, gotta get my head right
Too much attention, like I'm covered up in headlights
Live fast, living only hoping that I sped right
Why everybody bein' fully 'cause my bread right
No politickin' do 'em like a politician
In the ghetto with a woman, playin' side edition
It don't matter, where we at, she goin' live audition
Real freak with a body that was fly division
And there was never entertainment Illuminati
Mark ties, you could think my name was True Gotti
I'm from the bottom, I forever represent the hood
Kickin' it hard, like a nigga tryin' to do karate
I know they watchin', so I'm never ballin' on a budget
Lord, people couldn't stand me, other people love it
Anything I do at home I bet I do in public
Unless I'm trappin', hold up, homie, that's a different subject

[Chorus]
That's too much weight on me
Uh, I've been dealin' with the load
I've been fuckin' with them hoes
Are you friend or you foes?
I don't know
That's too much weight on me
Propaganda all the way in Atlanta
It get real when they stamp ya
Can't wait for the money 'cause the money don't wait on me

[Hook]
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya, ya-a
Wait
I, ya, ya, ya
I, ya, woo, ya
I, ya, ya-a, ya, ya
Don't wait on me
