[Verse 1: Young Dro]
This shit cold, slow nigga down move the blitz slow
They don't see a nigga cause the tint tho
I'm lookin' for a mothafuckin' nympho
Bricks in the goddamn Pinto
You want a couple those get the info
Break down dimes look like like mentos
If the shoes ain't a grand, we don't get those
Uh, hurry up nigga this the last ki
They don't know where the fiberglass safe at
To get in that bitch you need a glass key
I'm ballin' like a mothafuckin' athlete
These niggas can't rap if you ask me
Check the alphabet nigga I'm the last "G"
Usain Bolt can't catch me !
Boat motor chevy can't pass me
Pink berry Mollie bitch rasby
If a nigga think he better I forgive him
“Dro spit like Pac” nigga begged him

I took a .45 'till the stomach can' kill him !
Young Dro !

I got flavor, check out my ingredients nigga
I get higher than a balloon with helium in it

Rush a ho like Willie McGinest
I'm really committed to fuckin with the richest of bitches
I'm itching for digits
I'm part way pimpin efficient
Bitches see the Chevrolet and get to winking and wishing

[Verse 4: Young Dro]:

Hey (?) with the rocks on you can get popped on
Light yellow Chevy the color of popcorn
My bitch wrap me, I got the façon
Drop in the mirror imma gettin' my floss on
Hands-free phone I'm gettin' my talk on

If I ain't gettin money then nigga you bought wrong
When your broad callin the house but nigga I'm not home


[Hook]
