(Ralph Lauren Reefa)

Burn whine In Malibu houses in the carelboo
Battle root nigga I was slaughty on cash
G high ain't coming down till I parachute
Thousand round gasket, showing with their cali do
Get no hit your at, then I bet my bow and arrow do..
Rimigate your ass bitch, 40 pound a rabbit food
Twelve inch clip bitch I'm busting to the glauc melt
Thought a nigga mouth for pow pow hot breath
Top ship, bottom like y'all nigga sudden might
Tell your bitch she feel alone
Oh I'm gonna get your body right
Nigga say he fell right I got benz in the L
Got the bets em in the style make em slide through the L hey

I've been trying to get my..off the..on the ass front
They mad 'cause I'm still fresh and I can rap my ass off
Buy a nigga all face all no bells

God walk the earth with me so none of y'all hurting me
Yeah I'm in the drop top wet paint certainly
You devils think I'm by myself but Jesus in the verb with me

You see my pistol hangin out you ain't gotta search me
When they tell my real tell I left em bustin
Your hustle and I sleep look good she's tryin to fuck me
