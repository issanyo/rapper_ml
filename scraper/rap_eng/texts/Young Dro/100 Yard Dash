[Intro]
Young Dro, ya'll already know what it is when I'm on that Xtaci, who this is Grand Hustle? Sunshine, Bola, aye lets do it nigga

[Chorus: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, straight drop blast
Niggas try to jack it, then straight drop dash
Trunk on blast, now the cars go fast
Chopper make a nigga do a 100 yard dash

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Ima Bankhead veteran, got 'em takin' Excedrin (my head hurt)
Suckas call me a bitch when they saw me on David Letterman (the fuck?)
Ride around severin', off the heads of my brethren
Man this gangsta bitch been on pause all ever since (it's a pause), I was young was never sent
Now I'm in a yellow Bent, thought the shit was lame, that's why I ain't go and get the yellow tint (young dro)
Tell 'em Kent, we ride Phantoms supplyin' efforts
Body full of reptile, camels and fine pampers
Shine upper, fox fur, submarine box fur
Kill a nigga ass sometime they call me clockster
Lightskin Mossberg, nothin' black with the chrome rim
26 down is the black back with the chrome front

[Chorus: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, straight drop blast
Niggas try to jack it, then straight drop dash
Trunk on blast, now the cars go fast
Chopper make a nigga do a 100 yard dash

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Brass code astro, big shit mint in the van, dead fresh nigga playin' Polo Castro, give em what they ask fo' (what)
Twenty thousand in Saks, stand on the trap top see the damn task force (where you at nigga)
Come back in a black Porsche (with who?), me and Bola, it's Xtaci time when the Sunshine, it's over
White corner, systems symmetric forces success survey no choice of aggressive
My broads work on Giuseppes at night, Marc Jacob in a maple Masserati, I'm rich, nothin' to do, so I'm takin' up karate (waa)
And I'm takin' up my body like an NFL quarterback, Michael Vick shit, I know how to bring a quarter back

[Chorus: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, straight drop blast
Niggas try to jack it, then straight drop dash
Trunk on blast, now the cars go fast
Chopper make a nigga do a 100 yard dash

[Verse 3: Xtaci (Bola & Sunshine)]
Bitch please, shawty I know you ain't got these
Ferragamo's on my face and some Juicy Couture jeans
Bitch I'm ballin' with some folks who be lettin' they shoulder lean (shoulder lean)
Know them grills gon bling and them banks go ching (listen)
Ima queen, five karat ring, see through blouse and my nipples ain't seen
Aye look, everybody know that I'm quick to beat a hoe ass (bitch you already know)
In a quick flash, make them bitches sick a flow fast
Droptop in the other seat, I got plenty cash
Always first class, bitch I was made to last
We were on rags, still stuntin' with a Coach bag
Young fly bitches like to ride when the beat blast

[Chorus: Young Dro]
All we make is cash, straight drop blast
Niggas try to jack it, then straight drop dash
Trunk on blast, now the cars go fast
Chopper make a nigga do a 100 yard dash
