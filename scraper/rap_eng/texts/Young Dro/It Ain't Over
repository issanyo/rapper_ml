[Hook]
Fuck the fat lady, it ain't over 'till the trap lady sang
Fishscale boy, nineteen eighty Kane

[Verse 1]
My car fuchsia, everything's super
Lights camera action, no time for bloopers
Fishscale shawty, I'm the blue coupe mover
Definitely lot of losers, snatch a broad and use her
Show her how to blow on my glass, eighty cash
Eighty packs of racks and the classical eighty jazz
Eighty bags of money, eighty macks from roni
A.K.A. they turning beef to eighty packs of bologne
They waited on me, telling when its my time to cool it
Blue chevy sit tall, like a Colorado moose do
My cookies round like moons too, my Regal look like prune juice
Why should I be Bishop, I'm drizzled, I got my own Juice
Own crew, on 26s on my own coupe
Own crib, own bricks, plus I own a couple chicks
Know how to put bitches on they own, now they suckin' dick
A1 wit lil' bougie, they gotta be lickin' pussy
Money push it, bitch we got a avalanche block
With mo cocaine than they can pull off of the dock
Cut em off, Vera Wang bitches ain't a thang
In the chair with the brains gettin' brains, diamonds on my chain

Saks peanut butter thick stackin' payin' pita bread, eighties Chevy jelly red, milk white yellow guts
Supermodel of the year, lock me a handle cause
Straight yay, handle plug, this is what I'm used ta, million dollar baby we knock 'em out like [?]
Nitro booster, Nextel user, the early bird get the worm, I'm up before the rooster
Even .357, cockle doodle doo ya, catch him on Rocky Road and let lil' mister free do ya
Trap fans can't wait the Grand Hustle let me loose bruh, 28 over you, it's my time I'm overdue
Mansion in the phantom on em, baby momma lotus blue, cocaine fame Ima buy a mink coat or two
Black triple thick to the floor, young congo, I'm ghetto, me and Tom Cruise still havin' lunch though
Socks cost two hundred, niggas call for jumanji, fishscale buy the dry, the bitch front it, twenty shy of a hundred, dro and his royalty, I bet I make a fool of niggas whose ignorin' me

[Verse 3]
Blow the brains out the Chevy I'm grippin' the wood heavily, break downs heavy, yo sacks I'm gettin' gregory
Strip game, Dro hoes entertain like Cedric, aye

Call me Mr. Pita boy, shell toe FILA boy, Polo Ralph Lauren man these hoes can't see the boy
Either twice spray you, retaliation or may you, education and wise I'll murder the AU
Smarter than Doogie Howser, I am not a browser, we walk up in the mall and spend a nigga whole house up
Tell the truth platinum pussy nigga shut ya mouth up, Dro goin' nickel, P$C is a missile, Cartier boy official, certified platinum, look at the Billboards yeen even gotta ask 'em
