[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Coulda flown to anywhere in the world
Anywhere in the world
But I'm feelin the city tonight
Yeah, I'm feelin the city tonight
Put your hand in the air if you're fresh in the building
You killin the city tonight
I got the same ol' attitude
It's just a different night, a different night
This is a different night, I live a different life
Everyone pays to live out they dreams
Shit, mind that's a different price
Where is the cure for bitch niggas?
Fuck, it ain't no prescription to write
The world is a jungle, oh you scared nigga?
Here's some religious advice
I'm out of this world yet still in my zone
I flipped up a sound and created my own
All of the cities that I could've flown
Fuck it, tonight I'm a make it my home
Yes, I'm out of this world, still in my zone
Flipped up the sound and created my own
All of the cities that I could've flown
Well fuck it, tonight I'm a make it my home

[Hook: B.o.B]
I got smokers on my right side, drinkers on my other
The weed man my cousin, the dope man my brother
I remember them days I used to dream of this life
Got the same old attitude, this just a different night
A different life

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Tony Montana, I'm 14 years old
With a pistol in my hand I'm a blam it
Catchin niggas still, sellin mixes in the alley
I ain't gon stop til I get me a Grammy
And force this rappin, I'm a kill em, I'm a helluva nigga
It was a critical piece, start tellin them nigga
I be doin niggas pitiful, beat em up physical
Make me start rappin like I'm goddamn Mystikal
Hit em with pistols, I'm killin these niggas in cars
Niggas ain't hard, I hit it with killa bars
Hand me the pistol, motherfucker I'm killin ya'll
Look at the whip, motherfucker I'm sitting tall
I'm supposed to ball and ride hard with ammo
Cut through this bitch ridin a goddamn camel
Cool as hell, mall on rental
Nigga either give me the light or I blow out your damn candle
No triple effect
One ho see if the other like it, ripple effect
I be standin on the trap but the realers is that
Me and B.o.B. hustle when the tillers is there
Yes man we gotta shoot, run em niggas with that
Ya'll pussy niggas so cold, quicker than that
Grand hustle, Hustle Gang, what's realer than that?
That nigga Dro back at it, this is a fact

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Might work like clockwork
A nigga owe me, don't pay and my Glock work
A nigga say you want in but I'm at her
And niggas say you want 10, get applied first
Nigga talk a lot and get shot first
You got a cool mill in this hot verb
I've been trappin since I was a toddler
That they dodging the police and robbers
Suckas lookin for me and I'm weighin a key
If someone standin over her scale
Do you know how the winner foresee you?
Don't know what you do, bitches know that you here
Know that you real, rescue the occasion
Go hand me the 44 Glock like the pill
You lookin fo swag? I got it fo sale
I'm workin with cash, they checkin the mail
Never will they be so criplish to witness
Someone like they business who keepin it pimpin
I'm swingin and dippin, they head I ain't trippin
They fuck with my brother, they comin up missin
They dissin, I missed it I guess
You can slip or just listen to me as I guess
The answer to easy, that crazy and shady
Would we have a shot at that baby's? Yes

[Bridge:]
This is a different night, I live a different life
Everyone pays to live out they dreams
Shit, man that's a different price, the different price
This is a different night, I live a different life
Everyone pays to live out they dreams
Shit, man that's a different price, the different life
