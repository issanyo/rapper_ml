She thirsty, like a nigga commenting on an Instagram picture about another nigga
So thirsty, like a broke nigga at the pussy club wannabe, drinkin' water not liquor
I'm ridin' dirty, that thirty thirty, on the back seat I leave bullet flurries
I stop pop, you be buried shortly, so tell the ambulance hurry hurry
