[Chorus: Young Dro]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Three, what you wanna do here?
Bitch, I'mma float like root beer
Still workin' on gettin' the coupe cleared
You ain’t got none of my shoe gear
Red on the bottom, right, they're red
Shawty, she a model her hair red
Bitch you ugly and bitch you ugly
And both y'all hoes look scary
I don’t wanna get married (Nope)
Chick, you a bird, parrot
I'm eatin' so good these hoes like
Boy you're gettin' fat, eat salad"
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it in and I'm bunkin (2 Chainz)
Got your main bitch on my dick shit she ain’t nothin' (You lame)
Her hips fat I seen her walk past I was like shit
She seen my Audemar she tried to touch that, I said bitch
I bang hoes ridin' in the top drop Range Rove
I train hoes I’m a pimp Trinidad James clothes

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Three, FDB man, fly like AirTran
Me and E-Louie's got checkerboards on
You ain’t got that pair, man
With my FDB clique, 33 deep shit
You tell that bitch man fuck that ho
I ain't stuntin' that cheap trick
Six for a birdbath, bitch, where’s your skirt at?
Ah I like it blowin' that kush on you like purp packs
Y’all niggas so whack and bitch you so green
I pull up on the scene in the green Saleen
Yeah nigga I’m too clean
Westside what's upper? Y'all niggas my supper
Fuck that bitch 'fore I do that shit
I might need me a rubber
Belly on rotund, one whip, four guns
If you see the baby mamma holler:
Fuck that bitch, that ho ain't no one

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch

[Outro]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
