[Intro-DJ Drama]
And like that...
We gone
Beat Mechanics
Day 3
Droski, holla at me

[Chorus]
When I walked up in the club
I was feeling like crap man
I had a pocket full of bands
Rocking Balmain jeans, dead fresh up out the trap man
Lil dark-skinned thick pretty chick walked up to me and she brought me to the lap dance
I don't care nothing bout the money on the floor
Baby you can have it all
I just wanna see your booty go round and round
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Shawty got a band up off them hundreds man, yessir
And when she shake that ass make a nigga feel special
Round and round, round and round, round and round, round and round
I don't care nothing bout the money on the floor
You can have it all
Ah, round and round

[Verse]
I'mma keep it real she my number 1 stripper
Up in V-Live, its just me and T.I
On the purp, I was coughing
When there's perks I'm with shawty
Dark-skinned cutie with a perfect hot body
Shawty was amazing
Hot like Cajun
I asked her where her man at, 'What's your situation?'
This ain't no pimp game
Fuck your strip game
My name is D'Juan baby, first name basis
Said she was stripping to go to school, yeah
She fine and smarter than a fool, yeah
Said baby got a good head all on her
I'm in the club throwing this bread all on her
Man fuck it, man I'm choosing, I said I want her
In the club on Bubba Kush, red eyes only
Shawty so precious with a 10-piece body
With all these racks I can help you through college

[Chorus]
When I walked up in the club
I was feeling like crap man
I had a pocket full of bands
Rocking Balmain jeans, dead fresh up out the trap man
Lil dark-skinned thick pretty chick walked up to me and she brought me to the lap dance
I don't care nothing bout the money on the floor
Baby you can have it all
I just wanna see your booty go round and round
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Shawty got a band up off them hundreds man, yessir
And when she shake that ass make a nigga feel special
Round and round, round and round, round and round, round and round
I don't care nothing bout the money on the floor
You can have it all
Round and round
