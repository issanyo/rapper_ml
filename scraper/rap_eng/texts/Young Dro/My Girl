I'm super fly
A few of my lady friends
Is super bi-sexuals
And usually high
Might even give you a try
You ain't in the know
You never know
Whether they do or not
They ain't gay
They just like to play
And love to screw a lot
Especially when they
Bad as Gabrielle
And got them booty shots
See em up in Body Tap
On the stage
With stupid knots
Make it rain
Smackin' bitches asses
Until they booty drop
I train bitches
To show all you lame bitches
You ain't hot
And fake niggas
Hate when a
Bitch got shit that you ain't got
Like better watches
Better broads
And all the the cars
That you ain't coped
Exclusive S-Classes
Standin' tall in the parking lot
Saw her pull out with seven freaks
Is that what you so salty 'bout?

You might see her on them roller skates
Broke ass nigga 'pose to hate
Who the fuck she think she is
All a nigga know to say
She passin' by 'em blowin hay
Leanin' on a shoulder blade
'Shoulder Leanin' as Dro would say
She blowin on an O a day
Superfreaks and beauty queens
She like to see them do they thing
As soon as they get to the scene
They shinin' hard as you done seen
The baddest bitches you done seen
Earrings give off a bluish gleam
Rollin on a couple beans
May be high off other things

[Young Dro]
She might be high as fuck
But TIP it might just be my ring
And how I got this other bitch
She lickin on my ding-o-ling
I broke her slow
And stroked it slow
Lick it watch it grow some mo
Bust a nut
Bust a nut
And watch her fuck that ho some more
She said
'Dro can you go some mo?'
Fuck yes
Im the best
Ain't playin around
My pimpin on deck
Lick a bitch low
Now the bitch on wet
Ridin throught the city on
Big chrome sets
Wrist so fresh
Shit so fresh
