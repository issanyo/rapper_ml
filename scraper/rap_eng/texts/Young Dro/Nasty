[Verse 2 - Dro]
New York, shearling leather coat, it's for any weather (any)
Please try me, try me please I'll have niggas severed
That is in half, in a whip lab
I might knock a nigga off and take a milk bath
They keep on calling me, calling me Dro
I'm in the business with swoll
46 cars is so nasty, I drove that thing straight to the club woah
European shoes, tell em' size 43
Not too saggy, not too skinny, jeans D&G
Hold up, Crips they meet me at Crucial
Bloods they meet me at Brucial
And I got Tokyo, Tokyo oh ho them bitches some cougars
Blue Turquoise Cooper
Yeah that thing nasty
Don't let these super models fool you
These hoes here trashy
