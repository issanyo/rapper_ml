Welcome to the strip club
Pay ya admission
Ladies tell these niggas don't touch you
If they ain't tippin
Tell a bitch don't criticize you
If they ain't strippin
Cause it's the way you livin
Now move that ass
Shake that ass
Move it
Bounce it
Shake it baby
Drop it to the floor
If you throw it in his face
Mama then he gone spend some more
She ain't never had a job
She ain't ever worked before
But her ass crazy fat
And she know how to work the pole
And she smoke a lil purp
And she do it after work
And she party all night
And talk all day on the chirp
Want me to come scoop her
