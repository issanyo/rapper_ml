Big old booty bitches in my denim
If I catch her Monday I'ma hit the bitch on Monday
Ain't talkin' interior but my voice persuade
Catch me in Nigeria, I'm fly like Lear
Got boogers in my neck and ears

No Santa Claus but hi dear

She wanna fuck on the Young Thug just for designer gear
I'ma spazz on that bitch, smash on that ho
She ain't got no bomb on her feet but that's a cameltoe
I bet that pussy drippin' wet like a beach, yeah
Young Thugger knows, knows, knows like Pinocchio
