[Bridge:]
Dro dats all nigga
Car dont come out till fall nigga
Whip a nigga ass with a tall nigga
Nigga we ain't stuntin yo balls nigga

Fuck you boy you lame as hell
And them niggas came with you they lame as well
Get the fuck up out my face I got cane to sell

Pocket BK double whopper so you know its cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Everytime I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me, polo polo freeze me [4x]

[Gucci Mane:]

[Chorus:]
I get so much money man these niggas can't beleive me

And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
