[Intro: London Jae]
Tweakin', haha

[Chorus: London Jae]
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I been geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I be geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Yeah, hold up
I be spazzin' (Spell that shit)
S - P - A - Z - Z - I - N
Dabbin' (Spell that shit)
D - A - A - B - B - I - N
Hold up, bae, roll up, bae
'Bout to pour a four up, bae
I just got some head from shawty
I don't even know her yet
Real strong, real grown
Your boy ain't spazzin' on me, real feel homie
This fresh, rockin' Polo everythin' to the neck
Got five karats all in the grill, homie
Car foreign, y'all boring
Got TVS all in the whip watchin' hard porn
Rifle cocked .40 Glock
I'm tweak, tweak, tweak tweakin'
Boy stop, girl gone, get my syrup on
What the word on the curb, homie?
All my niggas got furs on
Geeked up in the club last night
Everythin' was a blur, homie
Benz blue, Jimmy Choo
In the booty club, find me a girl to get tanned to
This Cartier lens blue
I got a pocket full of dead white men, we friends too

[Chorus: London Jae]
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I been geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I be geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Huh, I ain't got the illuminati money
But I got the boy you shouldn't try me money
Wonder why they haven't heard an album from me
Didn't sell my soul, they tried to buy it from me
Ha ha, not for sale
Ain't a fan of fairy tales
Ain't no air of oxygen, in outer space
So tell me how the hell to fuel a rocket ship?
Now how does it throttle? The truth is a hard pill to swallow
Landing footage from Apollo look like amateur night down at the Apollo
And they say in space, it's four thousand degrees
But it's only seven elements available that can withstand that much heat
Look, now all these niggas political now
Claimin' they woke 'cause it's trendier now
Overnight activist
Even the President's runnin' the world from a Twitter account
Uh, geekin' often, Steven Hawkins
'Bout my coin like meter parkin'
Off the wall like Peter Parker
Here let's get to squeezin' on you like some squeegee water
Keep the garter bitch, Bandz

[Chorus: London Jae]
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I been geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I be geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'

[Outro: B.o.B.]
Stand up, send a bitch out, hit her without a condom
Smell that bag or marijuana, where the turn us to a stunter
I been comin' your Rollie, huh, do what you tryna, stuntin'
I run 'em up, dumb, not enough money, ooh yeah
