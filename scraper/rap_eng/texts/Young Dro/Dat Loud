[Intro]
Dat loud (16x)
JD, they talkin' about they on loud, shawty
They ain't know what loud was 'til I came, boy
Irene, kush shawty, Black Kush in the building
Slim what's happening
Zeron what's happening
Dunk what's happening, we got loud

[Hook] (2x)
Copped a 20 pack of that loud
I need 7 grams of that loud
A thousand for a ounce of that loud
That loud, that loud, that loud

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Aye look, I'm tryna spend a rack on that loud
A thousand for a pack of that loud
I don't know how to act on that loud
You can smell me from the back of the crowd
Look at me and look at my rims
Yokohama sitting on slims
Damn I miss my homeboy Slim
Weight like I'm up in the gym
Switch that Maserati to roll
They know not to try me with clothes
Man I be dso fresh on them hoes
Them hoes, them hoes, them hoes

[Hook] (2x)
That loud (16x)

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
My niggas say turn up
But what I'm smoking turnt up
My niggas brought the blunts cause they all been burnt up
Smoke 15 like can't nobosy hear us
We in V.I.P, so they can't get near us
Stunting no nigga I'm tryna fuck  a bitch
Money over everything, I'm tryna get rich
Fuck around with T.I.P and that Pimp Squad click
Dro said Guap don't worry about shit
100 million dollars you can have for a fit
And if the blunts loud, I'm gone smoke on it
I'ma light  it up and pass it to the wall
And show the whole crowd that I'm smoking on loud
Guap, guap, guap, guap
I'ma light it up and pass it to the wall
And show the whole crowd that I'm smoking on loud

[Hook] (2x)
That loud (16x)
