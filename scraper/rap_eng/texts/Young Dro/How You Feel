[Hook: Young Dro]
Four Diablo's on my whip, that how you feel
Take my bitch then meet the … that how you feel
Diamonds everywhere sparkling, that how you feel
Fire that gas up, Piru, that how you feel
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
That how you feel
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
That how you feel
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
That how you feel
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel
That how you feel

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Four Diablo's on my whip, that how I feel
Take your bitch upon a trip, that how I feel
Try me and I flip the script, that how I feel
My coop Gucci like a Crip, that how I feel
Your broad dying to give me head, that how she feel
I was born to get the checks, that how I live
Water fountain in the crib, that how I feel
The hoes bouncing off the pills, that how they feel
Wanna smoke the weed like a hobo, that how I feel
Everything still polo, that how it is
I kill a nigga like Jason, that how I live
Plus I feel like racing, that how I feel, go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Hold up, they don't think I tie my shoes
I be tripping, taking tumble classes
Tumble classes? What
I be flipping like a pregnant broad
Bitch you doing? Truly
I be spitting, took my bird walk
I’m buying chicken
This ain’t the same benz? How you know? Mine different
It’s a whip … and the kitchen, I ain’t lying
Think I am stalked
Ask your gramma, ask your cousin with her ugly ass
I can't stand her, Dro
So real 'bout my business
1000 on the dinner, tell them boys been there
How it feel, stuffing 14 grams in a swisher
You better watch your girl on that Marley, I might kiss her
