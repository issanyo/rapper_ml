Ay, ay who dis is, my girlfriend
Ay, ay who we talkin' bout, my girlfriend
Ay, ay who dis is, my girlfriend
Who dat is, my girlfriend
Ay, ay who it is, my girlfriend
Ay ay, check this out

[Hook]
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
We lied

[Verse 1]
Love melt, how could I do this to myself
I lied to her, and plus I lied to myself
Nothing's left, the relationship done lost it's breath
It stopped breathing, it died last season
I think about you leaving, cuz you a sexy lil' creature
You thought I was lying when I said I ain't fuck Alicia
And I don't wanna hear what Mika said and fuck Keisha
I betcha they'll fuck me all you gotta do is leave us
Make you out a believer we some grown ass people
Dem bitches get on my nerves that's why I be smokin' reefer
First we start arguing, I open up my ether
When I open up my ether the shit get deeper
At first you start throwin' shit then you start bowin' shit
Running round hollerin' tryna guess bout who I'm hoein' wit
You know who I'm goin' wit, I be there when you doin it
I don't hit the door no latter than one in the morning

[Hook]
Man it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning, it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me, well gone then
If we don't get along why we talkin' on the phone then
First I walked out now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together, why the fuck am I alone then?
I said I wasn't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
We lied

[Verse 2]
Man this shit killing me, I'm reacting like Willie B
Beatin' on my chest y'all niggas ain't feeling me
Cards you dealing me, I'm like what the fuck is you givin' me
We both got injuries now we play religiously
Same hoes hatin' on us, numbers they be slipping me
You rippin' me, you temptin' me, you thought that you was clippin' me?
I knew you got them stacks when you took 'em I knew instantly
Left the shit for you to go shopping to get some Bemanes
You acting like a enemy why the fuck is you hittin' me?
Hoes tellin' lies to you why aren't you defending me?
Now I'm finna cheat, now I'm finna creep, now I'm finna have different women in my V
Why? She lied on me, why? I'm fly homie
Fuck working it out, I'm finna go and ride homie
Now I'm sleeping here, creeping here, bout to spend a week here
Guess who I'm fuckin' round with, that bitch Keisha, yeah

[Hook]
Man it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning, it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me, well gone then
If we don't get along why we talkin' on the phone then

You said we would stay together, why the fuck am I alone then?

You said you ain't gon never hurt me

[Verse 3]
Fuckin' round wit Keisha, ain't no passion though our mansion gold
Rock Ralph classical Benz color pistachio
They love me I'm on MTV, game international
Me and Nick on 26, grape grand national
I love her I ain't sayin' shit, I don't know who to share it with
I'm talkin' bout my girl, this who I be breakin' bread with
Dread shit, sellin' dro, she never let the feds know
This house I'm in used to be full of love, but where it go
Man I wanna let it go, I love you cause I said so
I cheated and regret it though, I let my cousin Tres know
Told me to get a thousand roses and plus seven more
We would never hurt one other, that's what we said though
We lied gone and say it, folk we miss each other extra though
But guess what I can't get out my head, guess what we said, folk

[Hook]
I said I wasn't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
Ay, we lied
Man it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning, it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me, well gone then

I said I wasn't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
