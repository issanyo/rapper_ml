[Chorus]
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm focused on the 100 plays
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm tryna focus on the 100 plays

[Verse 1]
I'm focused on my 100 plays
My auntie and my uncle Jay
Man I rock a bunch of Jay
And I serve a bunch of jay
I don't give fuck like nigga jay rock
Bank here why's nigga play low
I'm going home anyways
Be ready to walk in eighth chair
Wish I had the reason my mama child
Don't rush me into my home alone
We tryna hear a bunch of piles
Followed by piles piles piles

[Chorus]
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm focused on the 100 plays
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm tryna focus on the 100 plays

[Verse 2]
Death to me like skate town
All me nee gon stay down
Thirteen bricks on a greyhound
For dove I'm in a loose pound
We gon fuck around we can fuck around
Better have fat feet like James Brown
And one of your nigga get wrong
I'm a squall up you like King Kong
I'm doing my block stop
Little nigga just watch you got pull on your street
I run your spot watch
These niggas get shot
I don't play boy
You work round here you gon pay boy
These things gon ship when I say boy
Around of your well like a skateboard
Selling this dope is a race boy
And anything you can catch case boy
Got a lil coming down here from Detroit
Got a deuce I'ma pay and a shit short
I'm out here nigga like big what
I'm a pimp these hoes like two shorts
Ten brigs but that ain't too short
And I'm a take it back headquarters
Fuck you fuck

[Chorus]
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm focused on the 100 plays
I catch the holy goals at my grandma's house
I hustle when my mama stay
My auntie and my uncle Jay
I'm tryna focus on the 100 plays
