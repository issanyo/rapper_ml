After the club, strip, when I get you home, strip
We on that grown shit, baby, hop up on this
You ain't never met a guy like me
And when the valet pull up, shawty ride with me
And I'ma take your clothes all off, take your clothes all off
Clothes off, clothes off, clothes all off
I'll take your clothes all off, take your clothes all off
Clothes off, clothes off, clothes all off

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, we can buy the whole bar but when the club close off
We immediately rode off to the old loft
You know what I told y'all, we pull up your clothes off
Pussy fill the whole house, they trippin', drop them hoes off
And no panty, no bra, no shoes, no socks
See how good your toes are, the goin' good so far
They trippin', strippin', goin' in, drinkin', smokin', rollin'
Pussy wet it, oh shit, spray Trey, say put your nose in
First round goin' down pop another go again
Panty to the floor again, fuck her 'til she soar again
Pimpin' in motion, I'm sexin', no emotion
I don't love err one of you, I fuck who's ever closest
We be on the grown shit, that ganster Al Capone shit
You know what you gon' get, strong back, long dick
You say no that's the wrong shit, that won't get you home with
Us you hear this song bit, know if it's us you going with

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Ay, shawty pockets, roger that, Versace coat, Versace hat
Prada bag, shawty bad, ATL model ass
Dro, soon as she proceed to strip I get on top of that
Doggy style splash, arch your back up girl, holla back
We off up in the club, ain’t too much that we can do in here
But pop a couple bottles to see who I wanna screw in here
I’m ridin' Bentley Coupe tonight, I can’t fit nothin' but two in here
Your girl was on that Red Bull, I think that broad flew in here
Bubble gum game, tell that chick I want some chew in here
If all these broads strip in here, I might just find my boo in here
I'ma leave from the club, show up at the house
Pink Rosé, shawty want it in her mouth
I'ma show her what I’m 'bout when I push shawty head down south
Tell her gon' ahead, blow a nigga out
I’m showin' out, watchin' my behavior, I got flavor
Durin' sex, I have always wakin' up my neighbor
And every time I see them hoes, I shock'em like a taser
And when I leave the club, only dick is what I gave her, Dro
