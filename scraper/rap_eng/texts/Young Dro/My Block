[Verse 1: Young Dro]
What you is Dro?
Every bit of hustler
When it comes tha block to my smuggler
Send 35 shots to your juguler
You're court case municipal, I gotta judicial crew
Super bad bitch that I can kick some Jujitsu to
Flow ice-cicle, ya'll niggas typical
Temple wit yo physical, shinnin' through the ridicule
Diesel truck, semi [?], black pit, mini bull
Bitches think I'm buggin', I'm just thuggin' in that [?]
Dro

[Verse 2: T.I.]
My auxilliary, pop wheelies
I'm more definitely, you not really
You talk slick but you not silly
You don't want no smoke, nigga
Body get back like good dope
My best friends used to cook coke
Want the tan? Mix it wit the coca cola
Yo bitch know 'cause my hoe told her
Get the chip knocked of off yo shoulder
I'll .357, .44 ya, that's a bulldog and I'ma bulldozer
You know you don't no smoke, soldier
No warfare, won't be fair, fuck nigga
We prepared, nigga pick a date and we'll be there
You can get shot and get jumped on like leap year
Fuck nigga, yeah

[Verse 3: London Jae]
Don't make the news, don't break the rules, we takin' food
Pop at a pussy for playin' possum, I paid my dues
I'm built to win, you made to loose
I make it my business to fuck you over
I'm an asshole, I'm Trae Tha Truth
Run through them hoes in them hummers
Thumb through them bands and the commas
Valet the Wraith, I'ma stunna, kickin' shit like a punter
I promise I'ma do numbers, I want tha summer, I'm comin'
Got my niggas back for life and ain't never fronted

[Chorus: T.I.]
Know I got a problem, you don't want that, nigga yeah
Know we got a problem, we gon' hunt that nigga down
You know how we usually do on my block (my block)
Bunch of stolen gats and a hotbox (a hotbox)
Ride wit the work in a speaker box, we did
Know we sell that shit just like your nigga now, we did
You know how we usually do on my block (my block)
Bunch of stolen gats and a hotbox (hotbox)

[Verse 4: 5 Mics]
Everytime I'm in the booth, I'm spittin' Grammy verses
I D-D-T yo baby moms, I'm talkin' Mr. Perfect
Let's keep it real, you gotta deal but you fuckin' worthless
I catch a body with this shotty, ain't never nervous
Black cat, so clean, black cat 13
Been gettin' money since 13
Kobe bryant got 5 rings, whoa (5)
You violate, the goonies go retarted
And start bangin' on you pussies like Mr. Marcus

[Verse 5: B.o.B]
Yeah
My awesome girl named Coachella, backstage I get throat-chella
Her bestfriend wanna do me to, she gon' follow suit, she a codeteller
I came through wit my codeteller, few baddies that know better
I'm in the lab, I'm so Dexter, we get stoned, that's Rosetta
She missed every lecture but still I got some class
She not the brightest in the bunch but still she got some ass
Look, in every hood I get a pass
Rest in peace to Doe B, we get it out the hockey bag

[Chorus: T.I.]
Know I got a problem, you don't want that, nigga yeah
Know we got a problem, we gon' hunt that nigga down
You know how we usually do on my block (my block)
Bunch of stolen gats and a hotbox (a hotbox)
Ride wit the work in a speaker box, we did
Know we sell that shit just like your nigga now, we did
You know how we usually do on my block (my block)
Bunch of stolen gats and a hotbox (hotbox)
