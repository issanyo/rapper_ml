[Intro: Lil Scrappy]
My phone is tapped and so is my living room
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room
My phone is tapped and so is my living room
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room

[Hook x2: Lil Scrappy]
My phone is tapped and so is my living room
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room
Fuck the feds, let 'em be mad
I been the boss mothafucka, I'm suppose to brag, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
When I was small I seen mama in the freezer
With a ice cream jug worth more than the visa
She used to hide the money in the ceiling
Having stacks on deck now that's a mighty good feelin'
Fuck the days, I'm gettin' paid by da hour
Been in the wood to long for da shit to go sour
When da fiends come, I'mma give 'em what they want
The definition of customize, now put that in yo' trunk
If I ain't got g's I'ma get it from the streets
Leavin' A.V.E's of tha Zone 3
On the corner with the G's, that's how it's gon' be
My whole family in hood, surrounders gotta eat
Gotta dope connect that drive me into tha bread
And my studio engineer dun cut tha tap from da Feds
My pockets is fat and my daughters is too
Just think of all the thousands of dollars we run through!

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
I'm goin' Tinted Key, da Feds tried to injure me
A bitch told Scrappy and he told me dat they into me
Know I drank Remy, they know I ride 23's
Know I let my screen fall when I be in DEC (Decatur!)
Think cause I'm on B.E.T that I ain't neva seen a key (You a lie!)
I was sellin' break downs back when dey made "Lean on Me"
Now I got dat bling on me, 12 carat ring on me
Yellow black charger, dats my waffle house machinery
Feds come I see them clear, like da diamonds in my ear
Hate cause I pop Christal open just like you pop a beer
Straight drop vodka here, choppa here, choppa here
Gator guts ain't in da inset but I bet dat ostrich is
Show you how to prosper quick flip a brick, flip it quick
Stick an' move we ain't got no time for dat silly shit
Show you how to prosper quick flip a brick, flip it quick
Stick an' move we ain't got no time for that silly shit, Dro!

[Verse 3: Bo Hagon]
You know Bo Hagon hadda holla at 'em!
I've been a made man I say da word and you'll get touched up
Keep talkin' shit bitch, I'll have yo' whole click hushed up
See me split a guard, that's prolly bubba cush crushed up
I'm a pimp, I'ma gangsta but first and foremost I'ma hustler
See Hagon all about his money, y'all don't get it do ya
Tell me what ya need and I got people that can give it to ya
I wasn't really hand to hand, I was more a trafficka
Gitcha' cush from Cali or some diamonds from Africa
You akin' new good but I been grindin' for a minute now
You can get it wit me but I'ma get it any how
Bo, Scrap and Dro we out here tryin' to get dis money now
These otha niggas out here akin' scary like dey in a haunted house
Just keep playin' wit it but it ain't a game, ain't a thang
Grab da thang and send da fellas brains like 'em dana dane
Dro be watchin' "Lean on Me" and I'll be watchin' "Purple Rain"
Scrap let's count dis hundred K go and pop some purple thangs!
