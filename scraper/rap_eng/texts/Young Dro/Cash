[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger, TIP

[Hook: Tip]
I be on your ass, I ain't finna sneak diss
All we want is cash, we don't buy the cheap shit
Trying to get a dime to a number, take it out of town, double
Then we shine like a '95 freaknik, tell 'em

[Post-Hook: Young Thug]
Ion give no damn, if I'm broke then I'mma take some
I'mma real beast when I eat , don't need no plate son
No matter what, ion save no hoe, ain't got no cape for some
When you start getting money
A lawyer erase your case for some

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
These lawyers erase these cases
I put my nut on they faces
Black diamonds, today I'm racist
I'm leaning it got me pacing
All of my headlines are swaying
Had money 'fore I had babies
I hate when they drive me crazy yeah
Pi√±a colada now we cave in
These niggas ain't never get no money
Cause they to busy running 'round misbehaving
I knew that bitch that little bitch she did went deep
And I'm rolling at top speed
When they come with questions I'm like shh
I don't speak english-japanese
(We don't comprehende)
I only fuck you like shawty shawty please
Like bitch I'm buggin, bitch I'm thuggin'
Bitch I came from nothing now I got money like it is nothing
Cheese, I pulled up with it, bitch I get it
I can't wait fuck up your little city, you dig it?

[Hook: Tip]
I be on your ass, I ain't finna sneak diss
All we want is cash, we don't buy the cheap shit
Trying to get a dime to a number, take it high time double
Then we shine like a '95 freaknik, tell 'em

[Post-Hook: Young Thug]
Ain't no doubt, if I'm boomin' I'mma take some
I'mma real beast when I eat we don't need no plate son
No matter what, ion save no hoe, ain't got no cape for some
When you start getting money
A lawyer erase your case for some

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
I be on your ass, I'mma take some
I'm a beast with it, if I eat some, I'mma feast with it
Shoot you all in your meat with it
Got a gat with me, that's click-clack
My designer is Mick Mack
Better back up and quit playin' wrong
Before I put six in your six pack
That's that Dro flow, I'mma slide through with this four-four
And I quit school cause of recess
Like "ain't playin' with y'all no more"
I'm a titan, [?] never know with to walk with no viking
They gon' call me up and I'mma spank they ass
After that you need vicodin
In the white Benz, packed full of them white mens
What's up Dro? I'm coolin' doing movies
Just hanging out with my white friends, with a black card
Talk shit, I'll bury your ass in my backyard
I'm a stupid ass nigga from Bankhead Cove
That part, that way, ordering hoes on Backpage
Tell them boys I ain't losing, fore I do that
Hold up, introducing my back gaze
Now peep this freeze me with that weak shit
And everything that I said come straight to the face
Pump that range, ain't no sneak diss, this Dro

[Hook: Tip]

[Verse 3: London Jae]
Quarter million on the 'tato shot
Try to get them to fire like tater-tots
Racing on a camel, I'm racing I'm on the top
Oh boy, you ain't saving, I'm saving, yo fuck them cops
Satellite, I'm on top boy this shit deeper than Barry White
They all die, we shot out the fuckin' Cadillac
Ain't no Cadillac, ain't nobody safe
Ain't nobody in this motherfucker going on a date
Ain't no licence but I'm whippin
That new Bentley 'round the city
Shit so nice, oh I'm driven, driven, driven, driven, driven
Can't change no gear that's why I'm whippin'
I want all my 'round a girl
She like the way I keep my pimpin'
I'mma give that bitch the business
Roll up all on her face
Yeah, pour up a 4 in the Matrix
I took off like a rocket, I'm the plug in the socket
She gone take this fuckin' molly
And I act like I'mma pop it yeah
