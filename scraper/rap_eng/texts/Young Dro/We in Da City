[Verse 2]
Ok my young ho psyched up
Riding round .442 piped up
White truck
Bentley truck
Tinted up
Rimed up
A hat cocked brimmed up
Y'all niggas get trimmed up
Me and k t in adamsville mirrored up
Timmed up
Polo boots
I'll let the four four shoot
Just like the po po do
Dunk on you
And ya ho
Switch it over to left side
Crossover
Gimme some more
And some more, Sprain bones
I'mma keep dumping the clip
Pop til my man comes
Layin bombs
Land mines
Mack tens, tech nines
Y'all niggas gone respect mine
I'mma have the whole set crying
Have the police like "man down"
Spraying rounds
Talk of the town
A K clip walking around
Bussin the Glock bussin the K
Niggas trying to get bust in the face
Nigga can catch one in da mouth
One in da chest, one in da face
Chain is grey, platinum shit
Killing this rappin shit
And I'm on Actavis
Actually, I'm harder then
All y'all pussy ass niggas just go and ask ya bitch
Young dro...

[Chorus]
Car ain't got no roof
Car ain't got no roof
We be in da city

All my bitches with it...

Uh-oh where your hoe at?
Uh-oh where your hoe at?
We be in da city
All my bitches with it
