[Verse 1: T.I.]
I got my fight game ready and my nine aimed steady
Chopper in the Chevy if they want it come and get it
Tell em bring to the Square or do i have to go and get 'em?
Drawn out on this corner he about to be beheaded
Let him up --> You know TIP temper bad
They won't upset him
Or shorty he gonna learn a lesson first-hand don't tell him
Let him keep flexin i ain't screamin I ain't yellin
I'm gonna go upside his mellon with that loaded Smith 'n' Wesson
(POW!) Put the business end of the pistol in his face he start bailin
You can't take the check and I'm gonna have to go stretch him
He try to get away guess I'm gonna have to go catch him
Don't care how many people seen nobody gonna help him
Juss laughin till somebody happen to come smell him
Disrespect the King's presence I'm gonna treat ya like a peasant
Shorty .357 in '91 when I was 11!
So fuck Chris Kelly
