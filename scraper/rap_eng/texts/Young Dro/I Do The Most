[Hook: Yung Booke]
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most

[verse 1: Yung Booke]
Acting real thotish, baby girl stop it
Nothing came out my wallet
We flying down the E-way, just me and lil freaky
Finna pull up on ?
You cuffing them bitches, you dropping them dimes, shit you acting recap
Came straight out the trap
Made it off rap
Now hope you ain't in the lobby
My jewel's European
My bitch Puerto Rican
My whip ain't a leasing
I want it I buy it
Yeah i do the most
Grab my nigga we close
Bout them imma go
I'm pulling and firin'
4 hoes called told them to meet me
?
Spodee clean with the chopper hit the street sweep
Gotta turn it lose and do it on GP
Rollie on, bust down, and the bitch hittin'
I need 6 minutes I'm in lil Harlem got your bitch with me

[Hook: Yung Booke]
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most

[Verse 2: T.I.]
In my new coupe on them AMG deuces
You talk it I do it don't make no excuses
Play with me boy that AK we be shootin'
You pussy protecting I'm paper pursuing
Somewhere in the A, i'm hanging with Booke, Yup doing my thang
If her nigga looking for me bet i'm beating him too
He felt pain when I shot him I'm beating him blue
Young and I got that check
Make no mistake nigga did not that
Disrespect who? you better treat your bitch like that
When it's all said and done boy your ass getting wet
Cause imma go dumb off the real with extendo clip
Try Tip hot shit get put in you hip
Kill a ant with a sled imma put it on Doe

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
Imma splat my clip till its zero
If I hit one of ya'll and catch a ? that'll cost you zero
Shouts out to the CO, who let me get the weed and the fire I don't need green dots that's real
Fuck my PO duck my PO
I used to post in the Bowen Homes alley on GO
In the eggshell off white GTO
Nigga want to buy better watch ?
Hit a jug put the shotgun shells in the mijo
They don't know how I came in the club with the gun, I was hanging with the migos
Got prostitutes in New Orleans, the pimp Creole
The bricks ? white like Andy Griffith
By the way me and Clifford doing terrific
Still got the blow getting dough no Bisquick

[Hook: Yung Booke]
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most

[Verse 4: Spodee]
Photogenic with my co-defendants
Every ho I'm clipping that's a ho I'm pimping
I got plenty vingits and they so efficient
If you a sucker then we ain't co-existing
I remember the time when I didn't have that much food to eat
That's until I got up on my feet
Thugging ain't nothing to me
Can't talk about bread which is cause you a muffin to me

[verse 5: Shad Da God]
Lost some cash lost some fucking cash
Put the magielas on gas
Do the whole mufucking dash
These niggas acting like shit that they really is not boy they never gon' last
I brought that gold to the block with the stick in the seat did the most on they ass

[Hook: Yung Booke]
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most
I do the most, I do the most
Shit I might hop out the ghost, cause I do the most
Shit I might stop strike a pose, cause I do the most
All of my pockets' swole, cause I do the most
