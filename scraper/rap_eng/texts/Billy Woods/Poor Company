[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Said every name 'fore they even put the squeeze
Friends like these, who needs enemies?
Got the news? Old Earth fell to her knees
Polished the shoes, I got the suit dry cleaned
Family tight-lipped, but I heard it was lean
Wig flipped when I seen his daughter's seventeen
Sad shit, but if we bein' real
Your dad was a prick
Lie, cheat, steal
Anything from him, best double check on your own scale
Rumors were he snitched
Depends who you believe
Either way, that's two bits you can take or leave
Instead, mumble something about space and grieve
All I can muster, old hustler tired of the hustle
Going out like Iverson chuckling
Brick after brick, rip guitar lick
The box cutter went, then he dipped
Jill sprung Jack out on bail
Then they skipped through strawberry fields
Wore it out, two days straight up in the motel
Then he left while she slept
Money out the purse
It's an old story, I just changed a couple words

You don’t matter at all (yah yah yah)
You don’t matter at all (yah yah yah)
You don’t matter at all (yah yah yah)
You don’t matter at all (yah yah yah)
You don’t matter at all (yah yah yah)
You don’t matter at all (you don't matter at all)
You don’t matter at all (you don't matter at all)
You don’t matter at all (you don't matter at all)


[Verse 2: Euclid]
She barkin' the highest damp iris
Rushing out in the flesh self-righteous
New breath, same old missteps trodden
[? 2:33 Curve the ex while] you wanna do me grinding
Time canceled out in dream
Black yakky rhyme weave, HD full screen
Side piece, peat leak, coconut cream
Ocean aquatic, back in the pocket
Dove leaves
At the core, rotten
Somethings all talking shit at the club
Grips tighter, straw man in the mire
[? 2:51 Bleed through ira]
Eyes up, Spun the wheel of life
Want the knife before my yarn's cut (eyes up)
I want the knife

[Verse 3: Henry Canyons]
No way, no way
No way, no way
Can’t put the blame on me
Shame on you
And you lost face and it seemed so strange
No wonder you never been the same

No way, no way
No way, no way
Can’t put the blame on me
Shame on you
And you lost face and it seemed so strange
No wonder you never been the same

Story night late December
Fate of a friendship surrendered
Heard it through the hallway
"Dad can I crash at [? 3:33 Onray's?]"
He took long to respond
"Come on", "Now don’t start
Promise me no drinks, no drugs, and no pot"
Commerce what we got, car for a start
Hit the park for the onslaught
Hopped the wall of Montgomery
Never thought my best friend would become poor company
Rolled up, oh fuck, yo, steam the leaf it’s an old dutch took a puff
Perfectly salvaged smoke rising, Deciding the night’s tactic
Hit the two to the one and he’s got a free crib Franklin and Varick? Dope
Open the door circle of seven chicks playing through the [? 4:01 day]
Mad blow mad drinks all sitting on the floor
Swooped in sat down
Hit the coke like snow plow
Slam three shots leaned over told him slow down
'bout an hour later, hit the ground face blue face down
What to do, who to call, and to say how
EMT and his dad on their way now
Thank God that he came out -- unscathed
I'll forever remember that shakedown (I'll forever remember that shakedown)

No way, no way
No way, no way
Can’t put the blame on me
Shame on you
And you lost face and it seemed so strange
