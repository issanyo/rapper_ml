Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

Over and-
-Over again
Over and over again
-Again

[Verse 1: Elucid]

Drifting away
Grey on my face showing age
Isn't it strange?
Come with the day
Stress left the moon out of phase
Millenial tension decayed
Prescription for pain
Paper still vouch for escape
Please get the fuck out my face
Just for today
I lie awake in the maze
Deluding myself just to think it would change
Strike on my name
I swear though-
Never again
I got some things to explain
If you got the time
Steady been wracking my brain
This ain't like back in the days
Tipping the scale
Shackle and chains
Whips to the back of the grave
Land of the free
Keys for the blind
Laugh while you fumble your way
Rattle my cage

Only yourself you can save and that's only if you can decipher what cycle which cycle these cycles are framed [?]

Progress or running in place?

Only yourself you can save and that's only if you can decipher what cycle these cycles are framed [?]

Built on the corpses of poor and enslaved

Fortune enjoyed to this day
Fortune enjoyed to this day
Fortune enjoyed to this day


[Verse 2: Billy Woods]

Witchdoctor under northern lights
Bitter cinnamon spice
Dry basmati rice
Trying to bring my phone back to life
Life back going right
Thinking, old Gary Grice
Take job, take everything white man say nod
That's the price
Calvin and Hobbes with mics
Sherlock pipe
Earl Grey sipped like blood of christ
Asked for an amen they gave me a sho'you'right
Hadn't seen her in 10 years she could still get the pipe
Small compliment
Next album strawman argument
Visit the horn of Africa in a cargo ship
Garvey wept
Jordan gifs
My black-star liner was a Somali Skip
They don't know America ain't paying for no nih-
You know what it is
Before it starts
Like when the remix get to French Montana's part
Had to cut it off
I ain't have the heart
