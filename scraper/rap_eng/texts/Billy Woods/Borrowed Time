[Verse 1]
Longsuffering
Antique MacBook beat buffering
Stream rhymes
Greenwich Mean Time
Procrastinate
Arrive late to my own wake
Still pay respects
Hat came around to me
Said I know it must seem suspect but I have to write a check
Things are kind of in a mess
Shouldn’t be any issues though but before you deposit hit me with a text

Yo, you ain’t happen to have a cigarette
Oh good for you I pretty much quit too more or less
I’m just under a lot of stress
Of course I remember, that was the best
And that one time at that one place that was also great
Exchange various what-ifs and updates about who has what kids
About ready to dip at the first sign of a break but main man locked in
Heart to heart with old friend like we’ve got to start hanging out again
Just look how quickly it all ends. Did you look at him?
Yeah I don’t think I’m going to look in
Rather remember him how he was back then before all that and everything

[Outro: Madvillain]
Living off borrowed time the clock tick faster
