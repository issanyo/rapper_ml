[Verse]
She's bent at the waist, left cheek on the mirror
Tushy in my face, yet I'm seeing much clearer
George Washington works his modest magic, parlor tricks
Erotic services, do I know you from Craigslist?
Cheap thrills is expensive, living the dream
In her mouth like a dentist, deepthroat the pyramid scheme
Assclap got the class' attention, inverted on the pole
Disbelief suspension, pretending I'm rich and she's 20 years old
It's okay, my face is blurred too
I heard you know how to treat a customer
Clammy hands touching her
But the mask never drops
They get off when she tells 'em to stop
Suitcase pimp pacing in parking lots pissed, graveyard shift
Tossing my child support on stage in a room full of alligators
But she works hard for the money, so um, fuck the haters
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling, dancing on the ceiling
Sweet child o' mine, red red wine
Oh, won't you be my valentine?
Breath stink of Ballantine, vodka soda extra lime
He wants head but she held the line, walked the walk
For nigga's pennies, cracker dimes, talked the talk
It's whatever really, knocked 'em back, he's a good sport
All things considered, spray tan and glitter
You don't pay if she doesn't look like the picture
Satisfaction guaranteed, 420 friendly and looking to ski
Money for nothing and the chicks is free

[Chorus]
Make it rain on a slow night
Roxanne, turns out you do gotta put on that red light
Stimulating simulation, the simulacrum faceless
Put her on stage, she knows the basics, the apes is impatient
Tears of a clown, the money of fools, church for an atheist
Make it rain on a slow night
Roxanne, turns out you do gotta put on that red light
Stimulating simulation, the simulacrum faceless
Put her on stage, she knows the basics, the apes is impatient
Tears of a clown, the money of fools, church for an atheist
