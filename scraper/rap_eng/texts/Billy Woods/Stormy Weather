[Billy Woods]
Rain delays writing lines, Cisco wines
Hard times, it was the best of times
The worst of times, three Phillies out a dime
Milk crate acapella rhymes
Tee shirts over long johns
Ear met siren songs, seems like its been mad long...
Times of feeling mad strong
Almost enough to pick up the phone
"Billy, watch what you think, finish that drink
Get the optics pink, life is written in ink
It dries before you blink"; that's my inner shrink

What's done is done but son she was the one!

Analogue tapes, dubbing crates
Wet crack and bagging eighths
Great escapes, Shareefy Musafeeky
Freaky-deeky, re-up weekly, speak easy
Woods creaky, isolated sleepy, ask Meechy
They can't beat me, can't join neither
Jobbin street true believers
Tax cheater and wife beaters
Conscientious objectors with heaters
I got a date with June Cleaver
And I bet she know the procedure

Remember those days like my first J
Brown weed and warm Tanqueray
Thinking we the neighborhood Snoop and Dre
Wasn't no 'dro and Mo' co
We was high as a mo'fo' though
Me and Ken used to cut white people's grass
Split the cash and page Garry for some grass
Fat ass nickel bags, fucking with country trap
Niggas smoking unk fast, forties before class
I wasn't supposed to be the only one rapping
Meridian polishing gems, dead-lift weight back when
Backspin, but shit happens
Niggas ain't fail to plan, they got shot, they got locked

The hundred ways to end up in a box
A bad bag of brown, a one too many trips out of town
A what goes around comes back with the four pound
Bet that I'ma hold it down

[Outro]
It's been raining on us, much love 301 to 914 and everything in between
Thanks alot Shareefy you know what I'm saying? But we know you smoked that weed though, don't front
Stormy weather, Backwoodz Studios holler at us...
Obligatory cliche #1
