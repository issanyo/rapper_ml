[Chorus]
You won't get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't never get no answers
You won't get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers
You won't never get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers
You won't get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't never get no answers

[Verse 1]
Thirteen days in December, you probably won't remember
My mother's son, I'm the great pretender
Smoke in my eyes realize this time the wolf had no disguise
Should she take the deal or no?
Question posed over jailhouse phone, don't remember my answer
But wasn't the same when she came home
Blame who you want, flame to the blunt, Bunk Moreland burning
A hole in his gun, just when you think it won't, it will, just when you think you can't, you'll deal
Gas leak, plug screwed up the vacuum seal
Seek rewards left all debt on the field, feel like inside it's a hole you can't fill
Who knows though, maybe you got a soul still, maybe you got a soul still

[Chorus]
You won't never get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers
You won't never get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers
You won't never get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers
You won't get no answers, not for the stuff that keeps you up, you won't get no answers

[Verse 2]
Trigger warnings in every verse, can't feel it if it doesn't hurt, Ted Koppel doppleganged and
Told the cops we rap singers, they said we dead ringers, smell of the wax lingers
Watched my man smoke till the cracks was finished, best among us ended up broken and splintered
Maybe that'd explain why I'm staring away in shame when she asked why they take my baby away

Just pray yours don't live to see the day, every day hustle
His own lookout and muscle, slow pitch
Once whitey show he code switched, told the bitch wish you the best-- click
Text written never pressed send, voices in my head is all yes men, consensus is yes
Fucked up again, friends, how many of us have them, hard bargains, shotgun apartments
Smirking sergeants, certain death the direction you march in

(Born alone die alone, no matter who your man is
Born alone die alone
Born alone die alone, no matter who your man is
Hope you live long enough)
