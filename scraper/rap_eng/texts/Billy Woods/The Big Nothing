[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Getting old
The protagonist smokes at home alone, stoned
Dingy housecoat rotary phone
Hidden room where cheeba is grown
Occasionally roams see what's g'on
The chrome plate keys the elephant bone
Took the chalice with a shrug
When in Rome
Sip the cup of destruction
Pipe-head said "Let me hold something"
Dance like marionette
Numb to it all like I'm smoking wet
Yellow newspaper said he hoping for the greatest
Dusty books
Chain on the door he know about that jux
Go to church if you're shook, or get a pistol
Dollars amounted to a fistful
Telling you like how big homie told me
Black girl lost
She hold me
Coin of the realm
Paid the troll
Raked the coals
Negroes run till they out of road
Dig a hole
Madder than Dame Dash, stocking full of coal
The eyes is watching God top o' the stripper pole
Passed down with the brothers on parole
Would say something but what do I know?
Sweet chariot, swing low
Scooping chunk full of 'dro
Speakers blown
Out of state plates, L's lit, tempt of fate
NY to D.C., barely tap the brakes
White privilege
Cocky smile like you know my style

[Hook: Sample]
Never had the chance
You lose, you get nothing
You get nothing
Never had the chance
You lose, you get nothing (not a damn thing)
You get nothing (not a damn thing)

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Friend of a friend, you had a fun night
Good job, and in addition he seemed nice
Still, something not quite right
Women's intuition
The difference between finding yourself
And coming up missing

[Interlude: Sample]

[Verse 3: Billy Woods]
Granted manumission
One black came back, knife glistening
Heart like a piston
Back scarred from whippings
Let there be a lesson, listen:
Whispered sedition
Saw Lincoln at intermission
Gots to get got, my gat accept no petition
Better yet, save your breath, ask God those questions
Possession, nine-tenths of the law
Gas station vacuum rental car
Back of the back of the bar, demons spar
Wrote in a cloud of smoke, Negroes in Paris
Clock strokes (trade peacoat?), await my carriage

[Outro: Sample]
Good day, Sir!
