The truth already set sail, I'm looking for reasonable doubt
The check's in the mail and I promise not to cum in your mouth
I was born during a drought, I was born to a house divided against itself
I was born into the mouth a well amidst poverty
Dad died, they gave me his stuff
I put a couple more notches in the belt
Play the hand you dealt, DC on melt seeds poppin
98 not gonna release your delta h meridian
Bush weed got me feeling like a kid again
Traffic island gilligan, dwb except the pat down like a second class citizen
No need for the sugar coatin', have you seen any brothers on the moon?
I got you open, Scott ? with the shank you get cut and ganked gaffold leaking from the poking
Big bank take little bank, Zimbabwean dollars what I'm holding so I'll take that now
Thanks, ? with the boy golden
Face bloated wrists frozen
When he wave from outdated Soviet tank don't be frontin like you dont know him
Buried in fatigues soldier slim, i see murder in a crimson tie, george teague
The overlook hotel is where I've always been

Your frame of reference is Brick Squad
Mine is Poppa Large, big shot on the East Coast
Ain't what it used to be, but I'll take it
I done boast cowardly threat, flow make shift
Hey momma! I finally made it!
No lie, son jumped out a third story window when we got raided
My feet never left the floor, I'm on that James Naismith
Soft spoken, unabraisive
Politely asked whitey to loosen the bracelet
? his way out of central booking
Hot date? I do the cooking
Turns out she stays up in the Bronx, I'm in Brooklyn
That commute ain't appealing
Best not forget your earrings
Summer heat searing
She's dressed for it so of course the streets is leering
My skin's crawling, stomach turning
? honking and swerving
She hardly seem to notice, focused like bourbon
Me? I break up trees on your fourth generation imitation Premier beats
That's definitely not the flavor
And trust me you not doing the 90's no favors
Louie the 14th in a clean glass piece slow motionley major
Theme music for stolen credit card movements
They caught the most etherest of vapor
White suburb, black neighbor
I'm high like black mayor
Rivet city ransom
But the hoe need no savior
Sheesh, she got me repeating myself
I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers
