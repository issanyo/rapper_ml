VERSE 1 - billy woods


VERSE 2 - DUNCECAP
Alright -
Lemme tell you something you don’t get
I do this with my free time
Your 8 mile jokes are fucking basic, sorry
And no, I won’t rhyme orange for you
Oh, you torrent music? Mine?
A thoughtful you
You must be awful cool to spit that
“Ha ha” “yeah dope” “shit’s crack”
“I’m so god” “I flipped wack”
Vape tricks are not art
“Say raps” - “top 5?” - “Great track”
“Your flow reminds me of someone else”
I know that's supposed to be a hefty complement
You're doing it all wrong
Fooled me , I guess now this is your song
But your 2 cents don't pay for my album art
I see, that now you know everything
My shoes, smell bad, let’s see you wear em better then
You're out of your element
