[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Pleased to see tree up to his standards
Machiavelli grand oil on canvas
Veritable raid of private dancers
Yet the black on road like cancer
Pack snow, tracks like panzers
By the end the feds was the Panthers
Count ya dead by the swing of a lantern
Don't even ask you don't wanna know the answer

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Use of power comes as no surprise
Clappin' at the read out from the other other side of time
He who maneuver through the flowers when the sky rip
Free black mommas' fuck the talk cause she a flight risk
Kill 'em in the saga scribe the supermodel sidekick
I advise you not to try this
Do not

[Verse 3: Billy Woods]
Of course its a drag
Would you go to war with the army you have
Steely Dan lead belly iron flag
Raw all ran em off like slag
God looked in his glass
The Devil seen, said I need half
I laughed, you must be mad!
Out ya damn mind
Watch her wine, suck, she wine, so
Move the post to see the goal line though
Mid 90s flow
Boke wood grind in the line of notes

[Verse 4: Elucid]
DJ Vlad big boss at the end of the internet
Whitesplainin' uncle tom preachers to disinterested black women
Rootless rap a Ceaser in a plane
Lil Wanye acoustic cover of a Sign of the Times
All cap, lemon pepperish wing
Exclamation on a rod, I did all inside
The times you denied me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory in the garden
Don't move not a problem
Revelation in 1080p
Worldstar number when you see me don't speak
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Scrape ya face to this
Smell heaven
Billionaire rapper with remedial economic analysis
Fuck I know I used to rap for pork chop sammiches
Black animus banished to the east
Hammers for the meat
Stay the fuck from police
