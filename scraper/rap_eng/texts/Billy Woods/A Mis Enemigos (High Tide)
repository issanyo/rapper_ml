Broke up on impact, I swam from the wreckage
Oil on the water, oceans of fire
Township necklace, sink or swim now
Big waves, I hit 'em like "Ow!"
Wingate and Leerdam
Shackled in slippers, shuffling single-file
I'm counting kilometers and nautical miles
Have a word with your preacher, niggas is foul
Kool-Aid by the litre, I declined with a smile (Um, no thank you)
You and I both know I ain't never gonna let it go
Cottonmouth in the midst of H2O
Knife in my teeth and the water's choppy
You thought I would sink prob'ly
I'm deep in the drink, sloppy
You get a couple bars I'm cheap with the ink
You need to guard your spot with wire that's barbed
Run-flat tires on cars
High tech, optic fibres, chain on your yard
Every door and window double-barred
Hunker down, watching the surf, ready for war
Eyes on the horizon
Thinking "That nigga couldn't've survived it!"
But I'm full of surprises
