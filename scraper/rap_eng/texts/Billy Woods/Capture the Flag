Billy woods - “Capture the Flag”
[Emcee(s): billy woods]
[Producer(s): 007 (AKA Bond)]

[Verse 1: billy woods]
Get rich or die lion, rather lie dying
H. Rap with the iron firing.  As not for whom
The siren, it tolls for thee.  Sheriff, D.T., and the
Fucking deputy.  Tackle Feds and scale walls
Close call, crawl, light up.  Fuck y’all, fucking waiting
For Babylon to fall.  Give me the damn ball.  New York State of
Rhyme, Chocolate City don’t shine, mo’ coal all mine
All-City grind.  Hearts and minds
Pulled over, swallowing dimes, I’m due time
Not tonight.  Off-duty cop get rocked in the
Gulliver.  Snatch the Pulitzer, pull it, sir, billy
Blur, shells burn like racial slurs, rabid
Redux gliding on black like hockey pucks
Skating from Caucasians, they got sticks, full
Clips.  Told you so like Hans Blix—now know why he
Saying shit.  Save your spit, wasting Sali-
-va on rims.  I’ll rap gasoline and tires
ANC necklace, put emcees in fires
Bitches jump in like Hindu funeral pyres, rap
MacGyver detonate with copper wire, rusty pliers
Quotables for survivors, Port Authority
Pumping dirty mags, snag duffle bag, hail a cab
Capture the flag

[Verse 2: billy woods]
Parliament’s Darwin, boxcutters carving a wig
This is America, everybody can’t eat.  Now
Niggas under white sheets, bundles under passenger seats
Dirty again from peanuts, pig pen victory
Defeat.  Live on your knees or die on your feet, get
Some, get some, run through slums the harder they come
Faster and making you run.  Jesse and Adolf
Bubblegum gangsters playing golf, catching fire
Camouflage choir, Terror City Saudis
With Buck 50’s and niggas waving Old Glory
Capture the flag, stay calm
Put the money in the bag
Succumb or resist, survive
Or live
