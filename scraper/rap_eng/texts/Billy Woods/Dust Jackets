[Billy Woods]
Blindfold and a rolled cigarette
Rhine gold patch Nicorette
Words pirouette, triple threat
Stance. Whole verse shorthand
Rubber stamp wrappers running, ran
Christ complex, kiss the whores hand
Washed the feet, generation noir plan
Rich girl, raw sex
Building had a door man
Corporate orphan
97' mentality looks haunting like cop conscience
No quarter asked, none given
Nightstick gun prison
Out the tombs Lazarus arisen
Cast iron flash in the kitchen
Radiator hiss like tea pot
Shower when water's hot
With that high power on the block
It ain't over till he molly whopped!

Lady of the lake
Serenade the snakes
Exchange papes just to raise the stakes
Retired in numbers let em rest with the greats!

[Elucid]
(I go by Elucid)
Yo
Yo I'm signed in
Earth sign spin
Kind buds for kind men
The night was on my mind
I'm shinin'
Remind me I'm a God
Staring at a false facade
Where everybody look the part in trendy garb
Who's the true and living?
A great revealing
Got caught dealing
Signs and wonders in a world gone numb
Moms praying Lord restore our sons
Ring the drum
Native tongue, what a world we spun
Black as some
Hot lung works on its own
Outfitted in engineered garments
Harsh harmonics - still starving
For niggas napping in the armory
One eye open, empty an eighth
Move accordingly
It's a quarter past chaos
Hey yall!
But what they say huh?
Another layer
It's just some paper
If I don't wake up, sail on before the days gone
Try to stay on, old enough
Know where it came from
Where your balls? Yeah we made yall
If I'm a hater cause I'm critical so be it
They just talking, I believe it
Evenings roaming east of Eden
Got my reason, pieces of a man
Season what I can from off the land
Gun in hand, I'll be damned
As I get illy for my city switchin' gears
Peeling corners like the duke
Catty proper chandelier
They droppin' hammers off the roof
I bet their boots was running bare
Heard Jelly Donuts on the move
Zoom I'm almost in the clear

When it all falls
