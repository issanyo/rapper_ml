[Verse 1: Elucid]
Fighter fuck, hate and lust, gonna be a steamy one
Black bodies in the sun, I bet you really, really wanna touch
Instead you pour your palm into a fist to pull the gun
If I'm reaching, we even, I see no other reason
It's ingrained how they teach it, reset or be doomed to repeat it
Seen it all before
Something bout the water, boy
Something bout the water
Pools, fountains, toilets and beaches
Bleach 'em, more than willing, no business
Me and my villainous nigga friends
You silly but so serious
Before videos some might call it a conspiracy
All the gods screaming 'are you hearing me?'
Eerily looped, hands off the youth
All pigs of ill repute
The heirlooms, laying hands, a chrome bulge in his pants
Fire shut up, a bone under fragrant magnolia
The scene across some dreaded desire, signed retinal diving
Ironic beneath the surface
Dark like rape fantasies and miscegenation, salutations, white supremacy

[Interlude]
(Something bout the water) (x6)
Same as it ever was (x5)

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
40 cal under the pillow, dream of home invasion
Shower in shell casings, faked a vacation
Squat in basements, silently waiting
Open window, loudly baiting
Hoping in the dark, patient
Aiming when they break in, broke them slow motion
Sudden blazing, wake refreshed, shirt pressed
Glock in glove box, small of the back tucked in the crotch, sucking my cock
(She loves me, she loves me not)
Four quiet, weapon begging to be fired
Admired by lamplight on late nights, no one the wiser
False messiah, crouched spider, teeth is all incisors
Caressed her cheek, whispered sweet, heavy, hidden heat, pregnant
But she spread her legs for me

[Interlude]
Same as it ever was (x5)
(Something bout the water) (x5)

[Outro]
Why is it harder to accumulate wealth if you're surrounded by poverty? If you have a good job, good savings habits, can't you control your own financial destiny?

Well, no you can't, and the first thing to recognize, you know, is if you think of this historically, we know that wealth is accumulated generationally; so you're talking about a group of people who are effectively cut out, what one scholar calls the greatest wealth building opportunity in American history. So you start with black people being, and by that we mean the home ownership boom that was built, socially engineered in the mid 20th century; you start with African-Americans being largely cut out of that from beginning. You're talking about a group of people who are behind from the start...
