[Intro]
It's glorious
Quiet beauty (Shh)
Silent stirs

[Verse 1: Uncommon Nasa]
Black like garbage bags in the night
Dark corners of light, glimmers
In and out of sleep on the way home
The first time seeing it, seeing this part of town or that part dark
Sparked but it'd be years apart before I called it art
I'm the first one to see the sunrise, this one's mine
Two for the price of one, I've seen both suns in one day
While this untamed
The randomness can leave you thinking for a long time
Out all night, it's just right
Quarters and payphones, but no ones home (wah?)
Sleep like I should be, but I'm a would be, could be city kid
Instantly paying dues and bids
My future rests on no beds
Like the first time that I saw it
Pitch dark, fluorescent light, ships through the night
Each step is more toward paranoia (watch out)
But peace is in the autonomy of these choices
Danger is freedom, fear on my behalf is emboldening
Like I carry all the concern with me
Strengthening my stance in every step, collected breath
I did this (me)
And when I finally do lay down my head
You're best to know I found my life's calling till I'm dead (till I'm dead)

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
I was smoking all night
I was smoking all night
Never missed a flight
Carry-on full of old soul
Everything cool still, climate control
I was soaring all morning
I was soaring all morning
Louder in a bong
Captain on the intercom
Surrogate sunrise on silver wing
I know the dreams that silver bring
Came through with riddles for kings
White man at the feet of the sphinx
Brought low as the sun rose
High as the sky fell
Prepare for landing, unbuckle seat belt
Gravity is my copilot
Iron island in the iris
Lego city from here so pretty
Take pity Lord, don't let them get me
Russian nail, concrete charcoal clouds
Choppy water, drab Mexican brown
What goes up

[Verse 3: Quelle Chris]
Goes up
Just breaking the first forty-eight in
The conversation broke innovation
None will be recalled yet lost with greatness, patience
Light years measured here, be clear
You block him I pin holes in [?]
Pupils sweating, heavy satin packing luggage
Posted Joe public in this private setting
Letting it all get to me now
It all fits in the saying
Breath of fresh air is cooler now than the AM
If I close down shop now
I could've been space and time minus the old bloke in a lab coat
In his bubble that's the companion
The man that was the horizon to peep his light show, a siren
Fly new rounds doing back flips through my synapses
At this junction
Veterans in the style of loud consumption
Puffing, puffing you got the Faust? now
Stopped in the crowd on rooftop when 2Pac dropped
Walking the line between D-Pac? and slutty money shots
Commotion at this hour could be the slightest snap of an oak twig
G-g-g-ghosts
Channeling the John McClane Haley Jo sent (I see dead people)
When the sun rise my walk in life might parallel hypnosis
Against advice from tonight's attorney I take two more sips
And try to gauge which danger unseen remains the closest
Here lies yesterday, tomorrow and today
Here lies the month, next year and years away
Here lies our latest attempt at eternity before daybreak
When too early coexists with too late (too late)
