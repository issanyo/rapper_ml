[Verse 1]
Stanley Crouch
Run 'em out of town, Ray Handley, armchair quarterback
Scored on the couch, slouched off sour dumb out Dexter Manley
Took the words out my mouth; purple diesel, cotton candy
Burning Down The House
New Wave
Max B acapellas over shoegaze
Well played, all I can say is touche
Blue Dream, Yellowcake, Black Haze
Pen game equivalent to Thomas Paine
Pen name the ambievalent Mark Twain
Intelligent Gucci Mane
Scholarship student, financial aid reduction made 3.5 the ideal unit
Face disguised, '72 Olympics in Munich
Baader Meinhof Complex, she likes it rough, slightly abusive
But taken in context, you playing the tune, she's behind the music
Records is Ruthless
Dave Checketts, I left MSG toothless
Told the croupier, check it, I ain't stupid
Universal Music Group waitin' on Wayne to go acoustic
Kids meals, yalls chairs is boosted
Fuck a flip, I told my whiteboy, just loop it.

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Application folded. Take position and hold it
Dig a hole when the grounds at it coldest
100 dead Bolsheviks in a pit, froze stiff
Glaciers of ice, alaskan fish, deadliest catch, type to stowaway on slave ships
Crustaceans in Barrels
Negroes in a slum
The cattle get funnelled to the barrel of a gun
Did his time like Papillon, came out squinting at the sun, winking at the nun
Life like a remake of The Harder They Come
I want mine here, now, tonight!
Corner the market, name your price
He's ripping me off but the shit is flight
Workers of the World unite for that extra vacation day, 6% pay hike
Don't bother to ask, you know he hatin'
Eating bacon in the middle of The Great Satan, piously pagan
Memory loss, call me Reagan
I'll call you Al
Free enterprise is why we standing here, I don't need another pal
Tryin' to get me up in the hoosegow, off that such and such
H.R. Pufnstuf
Familiar voice in your head telling you to just give up
Charged off that Cali
Marion Butts
Useless aggression like a cruise missile hitting a mud hut
Villagers stuck, between that proverbial
If they ain't kill you, then this side'll prolly murder you
