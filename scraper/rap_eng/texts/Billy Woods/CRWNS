[Elucid]
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)
They are who we thought they were
Fool me once no shame they done got over on me
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)


[Verse 1]
[Elucid]
Foreclosed and [?]
GMO Cornrows and lab coats
Crack smoke
Hustling backwards in a high castle
Belly laugh, slide tackle
A real side splitter
Thin lipped
Crazy bald head wizard
World dominate
Triangulate the trade route
Just to get schematics
Insidious civilians
Colonial catastrophe
Stretch across the planet poking holes
Gold and all you feast in famine
Evil overlords with human manners
Exaggerate savage off camera
Diaspora, north american wilderness is where i landed bruh
Most never made it across the Atlantic
Gunpowder in all you slathered
Sold, so what's the damage
Still driving [?]
Two twenty pound hammers one in each hand
Steam driven
Any nigga machine with him
For the cream simple
Back-breaker exploited labor
Imaginary pension paper
Fruitless apologies

[Elucid]
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)
They are who we thought they were
Fool me once no shame they done got over on me
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)

[Verse 2]
[Billy Woods]
Took em off the map like Rhodesia
Vengeance is mine, Frankenstein's creature
Gold keeper
She don't want to be saved Harriet Beecher
Uncle Tom's condo reek of reefer
Laurel wreath on Ceaser
One phone call my dumb ass call Lakeisha
Dr Livingstone i presume, pleased to meet ya
Old habits die hard still check the beeper
The streets reduce your mans to panhandlers
He looked away I stammered
But for god's grace
Reach for waist when slandered
Tall hammer
Straight 'bama
Raise black banner
Talk mad reckless flash tools for the camera
Worldstar, mesopotamia
North Africa hot like uranium
Fist of the north star cranium
Manicured saudi arabia
Daenerys Targaryen

[Elucid]
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)
They are who we thought they were
Fool me once no shame they done got over on me
Everything and more we thought it might be (let them off the hook)
