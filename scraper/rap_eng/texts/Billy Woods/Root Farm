[Verse 1: Elucid]
I did not come to play with you hoes
I be up too damn early
Few Joe Cola's short of a case
Gaps in my life, absent from photos, somehow kept the tapes
Smack the taste out yo' mouth, steamed milk, coffee and cheddar scone
I wandered Azania without a phone
Ordered step
Flash on death, when my dick get wet
Hex breaker for hire, ten thousand township fires ablaze
I believe in survivors

Lowkey oppressors call me brother
Lowkey oppressors call me brother
Lowkey oppressors call me brother

Black men are white men too when convenient
Speak it like you mean it
And I never grab the mic without grabbing my-
I'mma read, I'mma read, I'mma read, I'mma read, I'mma read, I'mma read right through you
Motherfucker right through you

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive
Keep alive
Stay alive

This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive
Keep alive
Stay alive

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Jake radio, squawk and squeal
Visible exhale, Nor'easter chill
Im in layers of black
Stretching these old bones, pointed toes
Red and blue strobe play me on wax forever
Blood on the doorframe, steady leaking
Told him "take that shit across the way"
Please pass me by
I score fiends shooting the fair one
Life ain't but fuck it
Sad chord shuffle, rushed percussion muffle
Short barrel red potato, move when I say so
They know, they know
Look mom I get paid for my thoughts, sort of
Yes that make room for me and mine
Levi on the way in due time
Shit don't rhyme no more, but making more sense in my mind
I been all kinds of poor
I know the line divide and surviving and thriving
What side? What side? What side?
There's a riot going on
What a time you chose to be born
Billy Woods wrote that line first though

[Verse 3: Billy Woods]
Nah nah
Lone wolf and cub via Gary Grice
Hold your fire 'till you see the whites
Of that eye, shock life had one last surprise
I was surprised to find people rather die than cut you a slice of the pie
Nigga was aggy talkin' 'bout "I gots to get mine"
Thats when, I knew I'd never see him alive again
Spliff like a pen, everything I wrote is in the wind
We didn't win, and I can't see doing it all over
