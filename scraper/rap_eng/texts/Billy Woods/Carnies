[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
I knew tonight would be the end of my life, I knew tonight
I knew tonight would be the end, I'm new tonight, it's the end of my life, I knew tonight
I'm new tonight, it's the end of my life, I knew tonight
I knew tonight, I'm new tonight, I knew it was the end of my life
I cuffed the mic, trapped the sound pressure, bust pipes
Water-ship down, this all block, we just let you come around, now you making this hot
No good deed unpunished, popcorn in a bucket
Watch the stock plummet like I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight would be the end of my life, I'm new tonight
I'm new tonight and it's the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew tonight

[Verse 2: Elucid]
There will be no more evictions, we're letting the projects rot
Purer needs you couldn't boil out the pot
It's body fails, scaling the roof, ladders and chute
Vertical patrolling the suit
Jump, jump man isn't shoe, swoosh
I hate the suits and waking life
When I die, keep the top button fastened
I'm hard bottom shining, I'mma slide on you haters, hard in the paint
Bully for you, do what you can't
I might not make it, get [?] behind me Satan, slab naked, drape 'em
Since yay high, notice something chasing, won't catch me running
If they clap me at a standstill, please burn this motherfucker down
Straight from the trey pound
I got a harp in my hand, a tune, strumming the cloud
Vibration changing for life it's gonna be a situation
I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew tonight, I'm new tonight
I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew, I knew...
(I knew)

[Verse 3: Mach-Hommy]
Ay yo, I knew tonight the lizard ensued no rife
Not a armchair revolutionary in sight, nice
Yakuza [?], writing niggas in a tomb, on the sly
Make the arm hair on a goofy electrical like lights
I boost the price
You niggas never do what you like
Hecker hundreds, ever move measurable bright light
My -rectable is like the Mariana trench
We hypervent
Ineffable we tetragrammaten
Twelve pounds of men in a ten pound MCM, bam!
Deoxyribonucleic change icy like
Dry combs don't ever [?]
It contains copyrights
[?] stones in the chains, niggas change
Watch tonight
I knew tonight just wasn't my slice
Smoke you like grapevine before you fuck up my wife
Cassette with no buyers
[?] up the breathe and then supply it
Quiet on set
Directors directing niggas with priors
Spying call centres, collecting niggas science
