He killed what he loved
So he had to die

[Verse 1]
Let off in the club mad loud
Don’t errybody go get sad now
Used to listen to Bacdafucup
Before they clapped Mac’s truck up
Kool G Rap to us, Fredrick Douglass
With a Dutch
Criminal Minded, dead men pose
9 Milli go hard than the beat to Super Hoe
Lean out the car one eye closed and wash
Negroes off the block like a fire hose
Same rhyme necks shine and glow
We shoulda knowed since 14 To the Dome
Nah, nah since D-Nice had beef in the Homes
Since Noreaga tapin’her, rapin’ her since they
Caught Lamont out on his own
Since Shyne wasn’t tryna go out like
Wolf Jones
You nobody till
Wish a nigga will
Hellz Wind whip through Killah Hills
Tall tales ex-dealers deal All hail
Entourage exchanging rounds
In ya gentrified downtown
Mayor frown, guns found

[Chorus]
He killed what he loved so he had to die
He killed what he loved so he had to die
He killed what he loved so he had to die
He killed what he loved so he had to die
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired

[Verse 2]
Chekhov put Jay tech on Nas' dresser
Supressor on the heckler
Prey Secular
Lay em down like Mecca
Superpredator
Layer gun sounds for texture
If it ain’t broke, cut the record
Burnt toast, cold breakfast
One entry, no exit
Your favela open carry like Texas
Settled it
With gunshots in ya setlist
No idle threats, straight genocide
Homie can rhyme
Fingers twisted into a sign of the times
Since DMX had blood in his eye
Who paid for Jam Master Jay to die
Get it how you live, right?
Send troubled young men to son crib
Wipeout, settle into that bid for life
Watch from cage, niggas ride ya wave
Like halfpipe, catchphrase merchandise
You was half right

[Sample]
"Fire out the cannon / You can't serve God and Mammon"

[Chorus]
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
Shot's fired, shots fired, shots fired
