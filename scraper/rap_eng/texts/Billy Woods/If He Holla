[Verse 1: Elucid]
Quartered off the block
Some popped up with unbearable lightness
Deadstock box on ice to be thawed in a time of crisis
Grab a mop Lord
Five swipe daily
Make more righteous hypebeasts
Rappers on High Street
Blind priests
No DOB on the ID
She rock a thousand dollar weave
Her services are well appointed
Only foots of Nike see touch not my anointed
You got the motherfuckin' coin but never seem to [???] it
You can't afford to credibly question what is the [law or lord ???]
Toys gettin' shorted
Under couple boards broke out extortion
More of a science
Slash to glory in violence
Forces
I feel so so so so so so so important
Warning
Void the sale
Golden feathers
Weights and scale
Hold my leather
Offshore tax shelter
Eat a dick my nig
St. Louis rip
Grease shine his lip
Fix your momma wig
Hop otherwise on skids
Thistler on the roof
There's one in every family
Next year I'm bringing home the cream
Hands free
Plan B, C, and D land speed
[???]
Bill Cook juice
Reptile skin off feet
Where when the praises go up
It be raining gold teeth there
POV

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
I ain't make the rules
I ain't make the rules
Your God is distant
Your father never listens
God forbid your father missin'
Had to do wrong off of intuition
Son ask what I be doing in the kitchen
Kid I'm trying to beat the fucking system
Came home staring a thousand yards in the distance
Kronos swallow stones during the interdiction
Bitch bewitching
Zeus lay low face like he ain't going back to prison
Now we in the weeds where ordinary turn hard to believe
Told my mentee "trees and staffs, stems and seeds"
Lookin' at me crazy
Nah I'm fucking with you B
You know me
I grew up at the reaper knee
Paperwork said they found residue on the beets
We all watched the widow weep just to be sure
I was eleven with the widow's peak almost relieved he was gone
Gunnin' they don't want that realness
When cousins and uncles caught the illness
Gone to Thanksgiving lying, dying, trying
Trapped animals tails go sockets
You want a sick verse buddy you got it
Off message even when I'm on topic

[Verse 3: Skech185]
My aunt was 700 miles away from my father when his sister died
Was told he stared into space numb
Was told to save my money and not to come
Better hold a stoneface in place of leisure
Please tell me about your vacation
So I can paste my face in it
In moments of pain and isolation
My mother lost a close friend
She sat with her and watched her fade
Funny the same man who failed with a screwdriver
Succeeded with AIDS
And that makes a protest or t-shirt meaningless
I stretched out both hands
To prepare for weapon stress
Afraid everyday to die as an old man
At the pace of a headache and an ounce of blood
Word to my liver
This cocktail's the only thing that keeps me from
Killing you niggas
Damn that site passed on your album
My people keep getting executed
But I need to lower my volume because I'm too black to surround [unintelligibly fades out]
