Rode through the past torn can't find her
Driving fast, the mountains behind us
Trees mashing, grinding
Secret compartment, fine china
Catching five, night finders
Black hills, wide awake pills, each turn at the wheel
Two asleep, one pick CDs, ride the beat
Hold the road to Noreaga's Driver's Seat
Switching three
Stretch, air crisp, breath steaming, piss, slept dreamless, drifting
Open country, squat prisons
Cities in plain hum in the distance
One thousand miles
You Christmas watching the speed limit on the road to perdition
Bad coffee, gasoline
Hard stares from men in muddy jeans on tailgates
Shared nicotine
Back when the road feels like snail's pace
Questioning the fail-safe
Day breaks miserly
Gray slate, press it down, break weight
There is only one road, the one you made

And they say they say they say they say they say they say

No sleep 'til Brooklyn
And they say they say
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
And they say they say
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
And they say they say
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
And they say they say
