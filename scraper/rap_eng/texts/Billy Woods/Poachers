They caught ya man coming out the building
Knees in the back arms twisted losing feeling
Child Services took custody of the children
Neighbors milling/backseat grilling
Like tell us something
Before we start knocking out walls and ceilings
Dirty dealings done dirt cheap
I’m on the third floor fire escape balcony seats
The roach burns discreet
Blue and red stage-lighting the street
Whole scene read like Midsummer Night’s Dream
The wood steam/came through on the low stylo of a drug plane
Empire in flames/Hirohito/it’s all in the game
A moment in the sun and son ready to name names
Knows me as Steve Biko/rap with the cheat code
Co2 helped the sour get diesel
For laughs he gave power to the people
Stepped back and watched
But ain't touch nothing like a peep show

Pig radio
Smoke em out the spot
Sizzle and pop
Perched high above the block
Where codefendants folded
Surveillance rolling
Falling off the bone
So composed
Vein frozen
Detailed divulgence

They came for me in the rainforest
Where i rap it ain't no tourists
Never seen again
But I’ll concede they earned that Red Badge of Courage
Shoulda boiled the water
Now im left to spoil your daughter/court your spouse
Do little repairs around the house
Everybody’s got a plan till they get hit in the mouth
A bird in the hand was how I took it
But fam went another route
Either way
Got to get behind the mule and plough patiently
When she moons blow her back out and bow gracefully
Ever the gentleman he left but not hastily
Nowadays that pass as chivalry/basically
Put my weekend in the air/lazily
The smoke curl
No apparent reason she actin’ crazily
But hey
That’s your ol’ girl
Owe her the whole world/woods unfurl
Like rebel flags the devil’s laugh black talon’s Eagles grasp
The metal flash/daguerrotype/picture me rolling
Seen an old whore in the right light/that’s a Kodak moment
