[Verse 1: billy woods]
Hang-glide on ‘em, face twisted
Sticky fingers, right thumb blistered, wig blown out
Stay faded like I’m working with clippers, eyes blink with
Mischief, link with misfits who sick of washing dishes
Montana and Manolo, optimal the primal
Goal, my vision reflect the Rubik of Cubis
Cocky like Kubrick, orange head shining, big-lipped
Negro, the L’s is like toothpicks.  The unwashed
Mases boo and hiss, the powers that be would like
Nothing more than to see chains on his wrist, the gate-
-keepers just pretend he doesn’t exist—you’re fronting
Like Dominicans with that fake-me-out piff
Don’t make me take out this spliff, duck and conquer
Ride through your fed city in a coffin, glad
Handling and kissing babies, mouth foaming with rabies
A black Fagan for these nigga offense, coat of arm
That steel day, heads’ll roll, roast the air, mass
Blades is cold as ice.  Bet your
Ass they’re willing to sacrifice Sachs is Goldman
Buds is nice, too big to fail
Tare the scale, make the sale, get bagged
Make bail—if not, still see y’all in Hell
