[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Pig knuckle, braised soft
White tablecloth, skewered squab
Smile like El Gato, chilled gazpacho
Greens tossed
Extra virgin sits on top the sauce
I'm boss' boss
Did it my way
Hit the highway to rob, some took a loss
And came hat in hand
Eyeing a seat at the table but I let 'em stand
Selfish
Butter poached shellfish
The charred flesh of the helpless
Scoop marrow from bone
I can only imagine those loans have grown
Like the mortgage on your aspirational home
Liens leaning on your ceiling, the beams groan
You got a lot on your dome
I eat like Noreaga, vomit crusted on the throne
Blood run out the prime rib
Student debt the next ship to sink like that subprime shit did
Napkin, tucked like a bib, filthy
Silverware untouched, rip carcass, grilchy
Swiftly, condemn the guilty, sacrificial lamb
Rosemary and cracked black pepper
What you want from me, marital advice?
I suggest you crack the heifer
Check her
Double check the exchequer
Then tell the chef
Pork belly on polenta
Poached egg centered
Grated white cheddar
Vacuum every crumb
Black & Decker
Show a lil' leg honey, I might tip better

[Hook]
A day late and a dollar short
Thanks for your support
Yo, let's pop this cork
A day late and a dollar short
Thanks for your support
Yo, let's pop this cork

Sour grapes flow out the bottle
Sour deez blow out the nozzle
Public Enemies
I got a right to be hostile

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Say what you mean, if you don't know shut the fuck up
Cash rules everything
Beretta themed code of conduct
At ease
Man or machine compute supreme
Honors relieved in favor of thieves
Make the change you want to see
Do you believe?
Cowards freeze power steam pack heat
Don't forget to make that crease 'Bama
Wolves trying to eat no retreat
Blam blam hammers
Peeled off in tinted jeeps blaring rap standards
All questions the eyes don't lie but never answer
Baggy r.i.p. Tees and lit votive candles
Motives random
Manicured and pampered you'll never understand it
For those who've been abandoned
I'm speaking candid
Overly anxious
Stress build fast it might strangle
All that glitters ain't gold gold but shit it dangle
No bank roll
Still on tilt like a kangol
Be thankful
