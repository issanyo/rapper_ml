[billy woods]

Nappy head, move to and fro
Baseballs is thrown(baseball's his throne?)
Don't miss a beat you'll be missing teeth yo!
Misery loves company
I be in the streets with my peeps don't...budge
Fractured cheek bone, nose crushed
Countin' stacks, eyes swolled black
Head cracked, got el, his bread back
Detached retina
So I can see em' coming
Ya mans got jokes, ready the ropes
Worry not colored folk-
In the future- young move that dope
How's that for hope?
Smile with face broke
Just a friendly game of nigga ball y'all
Star stripes, bright lights, carnival tent
Scarred and bent black bodies dodge and dip
He's a vet you, can count the dents
Tryin' to make a dollar out these fifteen cents

[Elucid]

Side-show attraction
Knuckle-ball fast pitch
Bulgin' eyes nigga wipe
That smile from your black lip
Three try, five cent
Palm spit, grip n squeeze
Orbital fracture injuries
Raucous laughter
Amputate the nose, save your neighbor's life
Live target, side arm strike
Til' he can't stand up right
Want-ads lookin' for lion hearts with thick craniums
Ace of spades, not racist at all no, he's Canadian
Paid nigga pennies
For every tooth remaining
Good-ole-fashioned entertainment
Bring the kiddies!
Overhanded splittys keep them bells ringin'
Loony tune birds circle singin'
Nameless faces, framed canvas
Sub-human standard
A king barely waged
Hospital bed on the grave, if you're lucky
Somebody grab a mop the floor's bloody
Studies in depravity
Bring in the next able bodied nigga baby with agency
