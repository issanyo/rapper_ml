[Verse 1]
They love they skins
Negroes and white men agree he can jump out the gym
Out on a limb if you assuming we friends
Assume nothing, be better off in the end
Buried where the Potomac bend
Harpers Ferry tides blood rimmed
Fight for Old DC Write tight eulogy
Houses underwater in PG and what rough beast
Slouches towards Northeast to be born
The Quickening
From podiums madmen heap scorn wild-eyed bickering
The best lack all conviction
The worst claim it was written
Judge said “nigga, listen”
Then it was off to debtor’s prison
Still caught the game dayroom television
Blood feud crude weapon water drawn wood hewed
No new news sky bruised sour amuse bouche
Dour delta blues blunt-stained tooth

[Chorus]
Sold it 'till it sold out
Sold the house
Soul long since sold
So it's no doubt
Sold it 'till it sold out
Sold the house
Soul long since sold
So it's no doubt
Sold it 'till it sold out
Sold the house
Soul long since sold
So it's no doubt
Sold it 'till it sold out
Sold the house
Soul long since sold
So it's no doubt

[Verse 2]
Homemade fade Starter blue and maize
Shirt had a Bart Simpson phrase
Copped weight outside RFK
Run off blocks like the counter-trey
Still, where there’s a will there’s a way
Time capsule raw pepper spray haze
One way or another all debts get paid
Told the brother all bullets is strays
Silver Spring Metro waitin on that Y8
Sippin petrol waitin for that heat to break
Sitting by the AC in the Ethiopian place
Best case scenario; looking at 8-8
Look out the window; errything changed
Nostalgia; Apartheid era street names
Now you got skin in the game

Sold it till it sold out (sold it 'till it sold out)
Sold it till it sold out (sold it 'till it sold out)
Sold it till it sold out
