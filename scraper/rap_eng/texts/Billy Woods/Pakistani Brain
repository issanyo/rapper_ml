[Verse 1: Elucid]
I'm a mathematician but I'm not a mathematician
I wanted to be a hacker when I grew up
I'm not a hacker now that I'm all grown up
Know what
Get the fuck from around here, I was a dyke in the past life
Flannel and cat eyes bad pad thai followed by shopping for cacti with you
You path alive, path alive
Head bobbing hard to gospel at the red light
Four corners, three-headed beast, two rollers from the 7-5
One crack the ten get the fuck from around here
Four corners, three-headed beast, two rollers from the 7-5
One crack the ten get the fuck from around here
Seen her in that Rover before
Riding slow, bumping dope on plastic
From the era when the rim was spinning backwards
Coolie High slash Kufi smacker
Cop her with a cloud kicker
Ginger in his elixir, the great mix up
Sophisti-funk 52 hand-block fisticuff who's pissed enough
I mean, did you have enough to drink?
My speech is never free, pay me what I'm worth
Uh, my speech is never free, pay me what I'm worth

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
They Ash, Sephardim or Mizrahi?
Replied: less Selassie, more shockly
Less more amour more foul mochdi
"Less is more," said the Iraqi
Lest his ghost wonder the great Zimbabwe
Left from stage coach to great train robbery
Castro Mugabe ain't no private property
The late Walter Rodney
Detonators wasn't firing properly
Sky opened like Lockerbie
Children of violent qualms was rocking me to sleep
Wet nurse overflood for flat teeth

[Break: Elucid]
Four corners, three-headed beast, two rollers from the 7-5
One crack the ten get the fuck from around here

[Verse 2 (cont.): Billy Woods]
Whitey swept through like Green Bay
Fuck what the team say
All he could see was gray
Still seize the day
Vice grip pliers
Paradise just beyond the concertina wire
A liar's liar, Hebrew Israelite Holocaust denier
Widened the Gaia, life like face plate hit the wires
About his supplier's inquisited, didn't bother to inquire (Nope!)
Just put your feet in the fire
Your cooperation is not required
There's no choir
