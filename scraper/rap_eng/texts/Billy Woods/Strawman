[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Show was a bar and lounge
Root canal false crown
Roll through the dust bowl town windows down
True grit water for ground
So woke still got a chew stick
Good hair party was true Whig
Didn't see any faces darkies was too quick
Susan Smith swimming out the whip
Endless pools Australian Rules
Genghis wept, Summer so cruel
Secrets kept carried like drug mules
Gave everything needle still ain't move
Pray to your God's or curse them
Buildings with grand chipped facades
Lefty so the grip was odd
Came up on the car feeling like Ahmadinejad

[Chorus: Barrie McLain]
The walls talk don't make it last
All's lost won't make it back
You're fading fast into darkness
Responses, darkness locked and ready
Responses are heartless, but ya locked and ready
But ya locked and ready
The walls talk don't make it last
All's lost won't make it back
You're fading fast into darkness
Responses, darkness locked and ready
Responses are heartless, but ya locked and ready
But ya locked and ready

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
I'm a strawman argument
I'm a poshumous pardon
A dusty box of video game cartridges
Sitting in an empty apartment
Sparking like the wiring in a black church
Arson sky darken with black birds

[Verse 3: Googie]
Skies black as the iris
You can divide it
Information or silence
None the wiser come to find
That'll be ya pitfall
Better pull that ripcord
It's all gusto
There's only a few people I could trust
And trust your gusto
Trust, it's all gusto
Like I'm supposed to
I'm supposed to be
Well I suppose
Supposedly
I'm not supposed to
I'm not supposed to be
Yet never let it take control
I'm told

[Verse 4: Billy Woods]
Ponder the lobster in a pot of warming water
Silver Elantra maijuana sauna
Telling the one about how there's no dogs in Rwanda
Stingers to  Unita coca paster to Contras
Gravediggin' fittin' to build me a monster
Lean sippin' slipping in and out of vision
Still steer the Oldsmobile game like Brazil
He wouldn't be proud but I'm being real
Live at the BBQ Pernil on the grill
Sore losers detailing how they feel
Winners quick to run off the field like count it
Violate airspace I'm a down it
Street Teams of 90's heads running around frowning
Do a DVD talking wise outside
Your former public housing

[Refrain: Googie]
I'm supposeed to
I'm supposed to be
Well I suppose
Supposedly
I'm not supposed to
I'm not supposed to be
Yet never let it take control
I'm told that
I'm supposed to
I'm supposed to be
Well I suppose
Supposedly
I'm not supposed to
I'm not supposed to be
Yet never let it take control
I'm told

[Chorus: Barrie McLain & Googie]
The walls talk don't make it last
All's lost won't make it back
You're fading fast into darkness
Responses, darkness locked and ready (it's all gusto)
Responses are heartless, but ya locked and ready (it's all gusto)
But ya locked and ready (it's all gusto)
