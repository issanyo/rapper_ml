[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
A pyramid so big it can't fail
A rigged casino tryna save the whales
Mind a shell
Drill, baby, drill, whether to China or hell
Murder rate fallin' and errybody on pills
Beef fizzlin' out, rappers not tryna get killed
C'est la vie, said the old folks
Just goes to show you never can tell
You never can tell
Let's keep it real
When I told 'em what happened niggas shrugged, like oh well
Niggas shrugged, like oh well
Whole country out on bail
Whole country out on bail

Larry [?] with them two bars
Each war seemed like the war before
It's a shell game, you followin' cards?
Dawg, it's not about a bodyguard
Your A&R never shot his way outta parking garage
Now it's not no A&R, it's not really nothin' at all
Desperation dacin' with the stars
See the writing on the wall, nigga it's writ large
They emptied out the vault
Nobody thought you ain't get yours
(that's on you man)
You ain't get yours

[Chorus]
Tell 'em why you mad, they'll tell you why you poor
They got rats in the floor, you better get yours
You better get yours
Tell 'em why you mad, they'll tell you why you poor
They got rats in the walls, you better get yours
You better get yours
Tell 'em why you mad, they'll tell you why you poor
They got rats in the floor, you better get yours
You better get yours
Tell 'em why you mad, they'll tell you why you poor
They got rats in the walls, you better get yours
You better get yours

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Build the black futures who gon' show up when you need em
Sooner than later, errything is four seasonal
On the other side of time I grew with my eldest features
Bedroom eyes, a green book reader
Red-moon sky, leaf-wrap reaper
Makiba hao
Who say got us a DJ, even they went outta style
Rappers runnin' on replay for quite a while
Ten toes down, they feet bound
Hell's hounds don't get me pounds no more
Bring snakes to crown your ball
Falcons war, my torch lit
Pop the cork
A force of reckonin'
Recollect to where my effort went
Deviously decadent
Omniscient, so benevolent
Quit your meddlin'
Rode a pestle grinding down base element
Formula configuring so delicate
Whether this, flowin' of the skids, sling hammer
[?] you out and get back to Wakanda
Drowsy river rafter
[?] tie my hand
Shuffling tarot
Battle like, dreaming of blanco langosta
When wasn't it for the culture?
Vulture been out babblin' bullshit
Lash for the bullwhip
This a fool's gip
Don't you move, bitch
