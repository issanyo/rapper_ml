They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way...

Through the looking glass
Robert Mugabe watches Bob Marley perform Zimbabwe
Feelin’ out of body
Fresh out the bush still see the bodies/Pompeii
History Will Absolve Me/prolly
Botched robbery
2Pac in the lobby
True believers, Ian Smith on my left
Dying breath cursing these niggers
African chess in the beds of dry rivers
A stick traces plans in the silt
Angolan land but the links Cuban built
Neat trick
Now China owns the dam your blood still gets spilt
Game sewed like an AIDS quilt
Daniel Day crazy straw up in your milk
There Will Be Oil
Dragonteeth sown in the soil
Planes overhead, day and night
Les miserables
He did it for a crust of bread and paid the price
I rep my era
Bridge the gap
Between Marachera and Sweatshirt
Paperback Secret Sharer
Admittedly it ain't his best work
Network Haqqani
ISI let them boys cook
Deplorable
But truth be told
We all love to see the white man shook

They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
They want it one way
But it’s another
