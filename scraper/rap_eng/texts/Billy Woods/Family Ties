[Verse 1: billy woods]
They say bad news travels fast, but the reality
Is time just catches up with your ass
Nobody gets away with anything.  Once, we were
Kings.  Now, niggas watch for the name when phones
Ring, smoke about it.  At the gates of
Vienna, the Ottomans were routed.  Defeat from the
Jaws of victory.  Nose is history
How better to repeat it when they cried to Jesus
Your boy stayed seated, had it all and still felt
Cheated, won the game but walked home
Defeated, woke in the night and stepped into woods
Still with mist.  The wonder of a small child
And, still, these are bitter fifths.  No stars
In the city.  I look at planes when I make a wish

[Verse 2: billy woods]
In this world where gunshots briefly illuminate
The dark, a wise man horns his heart
When I say something, she says, “Don’t start”
“Please, for once, lie for a nigga ‘til I
Look like a dunce.”  God found me in a cloud
Of sour reefer.  All I said was, “Am I my
Brother’s keeper?”  At the service, “Pleased
To meet ya.”  End of the day, all I could offer was
A guest feature.  Five-hundred bones laid on top
Of speaker, fifty pieces of silver, and I took it like
A preacher.  Three years from being twins
And when I get calls from family and friends, ain’t much
I can say.  Goddamn shame
Only blood I got and we’re strange
Meanwhile, my peoples is through the looking glass, after white
Rabbits, Abel and Cain reach in the stash
Twisting new strain, the tides they bond
Digging in a nigga brain
