[Verse 1]
If we don't win the ballot it's back to the Bush
Building African Deathstar that callous your children's swollen stomachs
Pushing in a presidential palace, big cigars ablaze
No need for the suitcase we already dug the graves
And those punks work like slaves. (chop chop)
So then we let the machetes coup de grace
200 million barrels a day was all we saw
One monkey don't stop one show (no way)
Back in business, see that pipeline knocked? I control the flow
Let Switzerland hold the dough
Tel Aviv will grind anything we get out those mines
Get Washington on the satellite phone, promise a price freeze
Guarantee the safety of Royal Dutch Shell employees
Increase the Mobile Exxon concession
And send our militias more weapons
Purge the unions, assassinate the students, but keep promising elections
I don't want to turn on the BBC and see anything about repression

[Hook]x2
They fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sipping Champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this boy you do get expensive

[Verse 2]
The village stands in the midst of
Such rapacious pillage we live with
Murky rivers oil spillage
Around here it's never dark, we live in the sparks
Perpetual gas flames look like rusted Olympic torches
Black gold medalist on derrick platform surrounded by armed forces
The last thing we need is another daughter
Don't drink the water, don't breath the air
Don't talk to any reporters, tape recorders
Special forces is the only one with cold beer and fresh vegetables
Knocking late at night cold fear grips your testicles
Pushing in asking for you her and him
They got lots of questions about what you were doing with them
And who told who what when

[Hook]x2
