[Verse 1:]
They know the plates on ya mamma car
They know where the hooptie parked
They know which your niggas ain't too smart
You prolly wondering what they waiting for
But nigga, just play your part
They know you be lying
She ain't stupid nigga
She knows you be trying all types of foolishness
You got two phones
They got all your math
Surveillance on your home
While they follow the cash
Surveillance at your job
Boss up your ass
Big brother just an app on ya iPad
Know when you're happy
Know when you're sad
Got a list of kids that's habitually bad
Come through with presents you don't wanna have (ho ho ho)
Be exactly how they laugh

You gonna fuck around they'll find out my man

[Chorus]
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are

[Verse 2]
Ya'll don't know woods like that
Good dude but come through the trap unannounced and play too much like Cat in the hat
Fuck up the flow, Hack-a-Shaq
Dead to the world, live nigga rap
Eyes red, can't ever get in the black
I got summn to believe in off the internet
Shed tears like I lost my connect when she sat
Me down for that heart-to-heart that started with: "Where do I start"
Not my first rodeo, we can skip this part do not pass go
Go straight to the bar desk drawer fulla Uno cards
Voodoo dolls, Gaza's "King-beyond-the-wall"
Nameless with a thousand faces, job description;
Be not where the missiles fall

[Chorus]
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
They know who you are
