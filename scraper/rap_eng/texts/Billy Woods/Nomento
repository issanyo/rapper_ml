[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Goosedown in the ghost town push the Peugeot around
Back-in angle parking front the Polo Grounds
Willie Mays plaque same Haze from way back
Dominican Frankincense Sandalwood burnt cinnamon
She not around no mo You wonder where she go
You wonder who she know You wish she was a ho
Your true self show the rest superimposed
All these misery lights remind me I’m home
Cruising slow, stopped copped mofongo to go
Stereo Diamonds on that Wood Pocket Fulla Stones
You wonder if she alone You can’t hit her phone
Pride too strong turn the loud on
Wonder if she really gone
Like gone, gone
C’mon you know she gone that’s a phantom arm
Opera catwalk snicker Rambo knife in my mouth nigga
Best seats in the house

[Chorus]
Is it real? Is it really?
Is it real? Is it really really?
Is it real? Is it really? is it really really?
Is it real? Is it really? is it really really?
Is it real? Is it really? is it really really?

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Pact sealed with cemetery silence
This is me you and this room and bearing witness
This is not my body
However you move I'm behind
Any decision you commit to
There's no windows in this waiting room
Nobody should have to leave here alone
So many different stories
A common thread
We're all on the final chapter
Small talk with strangers awkward laughter
Lowering my eyes
I'm not sure how to really feel if I was being real
Cocktail of relief and guilt got my stomach in knots
Watching the clock second hand stopped
Why the fuck is there a TV here playing
Rob Schneider movies on loop
Hunger pang I fast in solidarity
The air is stale
Color drab
Death surrounds us all with a familiar squeeze
We come in need making offerings
The prayers go up and the blessing come running down red
The prayers go up and the blessing come running down red

[Outro]
