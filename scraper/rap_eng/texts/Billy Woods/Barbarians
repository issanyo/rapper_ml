[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Just caught the sound of the car doors closing
I knew, I knew it was the thieves, man
I knew it was them thieves

Mad men and cowards
Mad shattered, no flowers
The Mad Hatter askin' DJ Vlad, do words even matter?
Electric bastards raised on step father black laughter
Indentured but own his masters
Yakov's ladder
After after you might be surprised who clapped, who scattered
Who survived, who captured
With the Jew in the rafters
Readin' history backwards
Back mask Judas Priest [?]
Black mass burning backwoods
Might pay a rapper back taxes
The Emperor at the gate
On his throne, in a state
Gold heron boned elegant canes
Don't mistake me for the hay season rubes, if it's all the same
Want the finest linens, gaudiest jewels, invisible chains
The crowd roars, crowd rages
The crowd's bored, open the cages
For barbarian hoards, we waitin'
I grew up around dogs thas racist
Fathers took firing pins out guns, gave 'em to us to play with
That's just the basics
Basically they all had two faces
Learned young what it take to stay in the king good graces

[Chorus: Elucid]
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at
Show me your commandment
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Empire cycle, what a time to be sedated
Narco haven
The lower the wage, the bigger the gage is
With no regard to rising inflation
Doublin' down on shackling multiple generations in cages
Free every god damn body
Free every god damn body
Pimp C slumber melody
Circle me on the mobile
New Testament God seeming like a no-show
Cross lowered from an icon to just a logo
By the boat load, on a vessel named Jesus
Suicide jump in slow-mo
Water ripple like it skippin' stones
Cast your wolves
Gone rogue
Backwood to bathrobe
Went Rome
Watched the sky fall
Oversee your cyborg
Terrorize the highscore
Raised in the ghetto a brown eyesore
Locked door no nan
Off white
Chop hard
Slide
Firearm out
Who you talkin' 'bout?
White terror come in many form
Who you talkin' 'bout?
Violent and or economic
Fathered your every scars of our bondage
Look how I hold on to them chains
Look how I hold on to them chains
I don't want to be obtuse, right here wit you

[Chorus: Elucid]
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at all
It's all very interesting but not very interesting at
Show me your commandment
