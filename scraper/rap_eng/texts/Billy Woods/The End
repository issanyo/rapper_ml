[Intro:]
Why is it when the night comes the whole world seems spooky, scary, horrible and frightening
Is it because it’s dark?
[Verse: Billy Woods]
The end is nigh
Scrawled on cardboard sign
Or it flies but ironically you can’t buy time
Nimrod's tower appears flying in the sky
Heaven’s gates pry
Blood shot eye wide
Weapon in hand tell God he can’t hide
In the last day they fucked with no shame
Paradise regained oceans a flame
Firewater pour
Ashtray overflows, smoke chains
The Pious riot
Unbelievers wait silent blinded by science
With the scientists uncompliant
Speak of red giants
Slow it up speed it up, antimatter
Family dressed, Sunday’s best
Wait for a rapture
Water level rising but the [?] object
Crimson horizon the board room’s empty
Reget normals, wander through sparks
Gut clench but fear still bubble up to the heart
Sittin on the bench shell shocked in the park
Hell shut in and locked purgatory sharp
In this dark world carved our name in the bark
Devil may care, edges fray there
Layin in the grass leaves in our hair
Fingers interlaced, forgot to be scared
What are all those sounds, all those things, all those sounds that live in the dark
I don’t know
But if you wanna find out come with me
