Sixth floor walk-up work off the gut
Two steps at a time
Apartment E9
Whaddup whaddup
They're cooking dinner
Garlic onion ginger
Duck in the back room
Settle up
The new shit wild, got me ready to bust a nut
Pardon
Eat like I'm starving small talk the clock ticks
I gotta split gotta gig nah it's nothing big
Don't get up
See myself out
Breath in the doubt
Sip fear from chalice
Pushed a Ton with no Malice
Turned the corner like Kennedy in Dallas
Emptied out Phomh Penh
Sat alone in the palace
Illiterate so they put his name in ballads
Words spinning in my head
Verses unraveling into threads
But that re-up stay stuck to the glass
Like a big neon sign
Screaming TAKE THE CASH
Hit the venue nondescript
They don't know the half
Pounds all around
When I get to the back
Stage
Pacing
Animal in a cage
Somewhere between let me at 'em
And let's get this over with
Declined the spliff
They took is as a diss like I waved away picks
But never one to bite my tongue
Professor Griff
Put my bag by the steps
Hit the stage and crushed the place like that's it!
And never once did I take an eye off my shit
House of Game
B-Legit
Fixed rate mortgage
