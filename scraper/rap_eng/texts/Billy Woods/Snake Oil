[Verse 1]
New boss same as the old boss
He who hold the sky aloft
The ark pitch and toss
Dark bark and moss paradise lost
In a shower of sparks
Warplanes screaming into the night
It rains on the just and unjust alike
Butane flame nimble fingers spin meth pipe
You guessed right, sightseeing with the folks
Squinting into scope, eyes is black dice
Improvised explosive device
Now you see the light
White
Phosphorous bright
Black truck, black Moses
Black tar sucked out black oceans
Diesel fumes choking
Blacks in the endzone gyratin' and boastin'
Dozed off, shotgun broken open
Laid cross his lap
Woke to footsteps approaching


[Verse 2]
My supplier got rich and quit
Tucked his hat brim as he dipped
Looking back like might let something slip
But thought better
I've got a mismatched assortment of half-measures
Contents under pressure, empty-handed
Angry beggar
Rubber banded sunken treasure
No problem with you, for the record
But never say never
Thick as flies in the sky bombers let fly
Who lives, lives, who dies, dies
Minimum wage will keep the fryer on high
Rag soaked in turpentine
Every night polish rhymes
Til CO's see my black scowl in the shine
Head on swivel, prosthetic hand on pistol
Ham on griddle, ribbons of gristle
Found me in the woods, fire low, roach little
Eyes aglow, mouth full of riddles
