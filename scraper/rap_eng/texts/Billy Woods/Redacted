[Elucid]

Triple bagged citrus leaking through the plastic
Blood orange classic old fashioneds
Bittersweet cherry pop
Steady groove i let the levee drop
Petty toy like spaghetti snot
Gutta slop
Ready rock retarded
Im skin bone and carbon
Burning paper noxious vapors beg your pardon
Hemp watermark stamp over legal tender vittles
Im blacking out on principle corrupted clash digital
When simple wasn't sensible
Levels we could bring it to
Dismember reassemble you all in the name of love
Im not crazy
Im afraid
Im awake
Im laying 7 stories high rolling complimentary shake
Staring out in space sometimes i feel nothing
Mostly out  of place most days like weak punch ins
Uphill hustling
Dead lung
Rabbit out the hat minus the crowd participation
My pain your entertainment
Shuffling arrangements might knock you out your trainers
Unexpected changes
Schemes turn dangerous
More means to mangle
Watch the cream durango
Guess thats how the game go

[Hook by Elucid]

Break and enter
All intended victims
Name change to protect the guilty
You on the wrong side
Wrong side
