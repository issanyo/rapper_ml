[Hook]
They say god remakes the world every day
But the amount of good and evil/he never change
It’s said that you pay for what you do
But to see bad men buried with honor is nothing new
I often hear hard work is it’s own reward
And that the world is promised to the meek and the poor
I take that like a kiss from a whore
I take that like a kiss from a whore

[Verse 1]
High concepts written in a cold sweat
Fever high like the price of gold get
Or high capacity clips from the grandfathered Tec
What you expect with a black president-elect?
Warned em
Fire Next Time but they fucking slept
Yet
I still felt bad when your mothers wept
Existentialist questions
Like Blood or Crip?
Seats catcher’s mitt soft in the gutta whip
Petit bourgeoisie hold power/butter grip
Clandestine meeting/foreign government
Money up front/signed over the publishing
Whisky neat/cigars blunt/we talked circles
Oak paneled study
Discussin’ how and when to murk you

[Hook]
They say god remakes the world every day
But the amount of good and evil/he never change
It’s said that you pay for what you do
But to see bad men buried with honor is nothing new
I often hear hard work is it’s own reward
And that the world is promised to the meek and the poor
I take that like a kiss from a whore
I take that like a kiss from a whore

[Verse 2]
He’s a vet with no stripes who changed sides twice to save his life
Still got spotted, pulled out the crowd and shot twice
Women avert their sight
Stray dogs lingered as the body lay in the street till night
Illustrating the might of snapping the right finger
Change in pitch/expression on face/a brief gesture
That holds weight like a snitch at the bottom of a cold lake
Anwar Sadat
Death parade
Warm coke sipped in the shade/he dreams of the day
Women guard him like Quaddafi
Bedouin tents Amazons in epaulettes/Tunisian property
Mom used to say “if you’re going to do it, do it properly”
Everything must go is how the sign translate
Approximately
300 K in the suitcase/give or take/the price of Monopoly
Utilities and railroads in Baltic States/We made a mockery
Of all you held dear/from Good Hope to Cape Fear
Manilla envelopes/Anglo-American De Beers
For he’s a jolly good fellow/ Three cheers

They say god remakes the world every day

But to see bad men buried with honor is nothing new

I take that like a kiss from a whore
