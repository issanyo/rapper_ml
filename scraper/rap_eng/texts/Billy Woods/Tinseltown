[Verse 1: Billy Woods]

They used to clown the kid like
Scared money don't make money
Now they doing bids right?
That's why conventional wisdom don't do nothing for me
Marvin Harrison passed the eye in the dungeon
Quiet ones be the shooters
He who dares wins
We down here with the losers
They robbed that white boy cause this ain't Hoosiers
And stay looking for crack like jewellers
Pressin'
Like army recruiters
Maneuver underwater, Afghani in the scuba
Four Nigerians one computer
Travailler
Middle of the day
Steak for two
Peter Luger
AK47 with the cheese
Smoke Gouda
Only priorities is right now
The near future
Optimistic?
Every morning between my first sip of coffee
Last digit on my scratch off ticket
Middle passage I had to sell rations
The rest got scurvy and rickets
Just another misfit from the edge of irrelevance
I been on that Ralph Ellison
Nowadays flow meticulous
Ridiculous embellishments

[Hook]
They said it's easy money
But I just can't trust it
She said I love you honey
But I just can't trust it
He said those his boys, not to worry
Just can't trust it
They said come through, everything lovely
Just can't

[Verse 2]

Pedal to the metal
Enthusiastically peddle crack over instrumentals
Only to backpedal when them narcs come knockin'
Any resemblance to real events is merely coincidental
Motherless child, Hansel & Gretel
Abandoned in the ghetto
Fear not a wicked witch
But a clever Geppetto
Have him holding a bag on stage
In stilettos
Separating Canaanites from they shekels
Nigga pennies add up
If you the neighborhood Gordon Gekko
Wooden nickels of that sour crunch like a good pickle
More flights than Biggles
But at tonight's show we play Don Rickles
Salt on your game, kosher
For putting his name too low on the poster
Drunk as a fish harping that no respect danger field
After last drink, ticket argument settles
Jump behind the wheel and it's pedal to the metal

[Hook]
