[Chorus: Henry Canyons]
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got

[Verse 1: Henry Canyons]
Day to day news getting harder to believe
So scared from these nightmares, sweat through sheets
So I sweat through beats, achieve true peace
Only get one life, just signed a new lease
All I need is one mic, and a few blues beats
Cook the [?] cool beans
Cut my muse loose, tantalized by the amuse [?]
She be [?] guess we will soon see
Revert back to the loop, repeat
These two feet face the beamer
So I can pay my dues due east
Whatever’s a crew, levers are pulled
My methods are genuine, pedalling through
Malevolent ooze, pep in my step
Getting me to the next plateau
Assessing the view, weather when the elements
No, not for the hell of adventuring
The meditation to better diffuse with training duke
In a sentimental mood
My family’s the engine, keeps me revving
As I’m stepping on the accelerator
To what’s ahead of me, let’s cruise
Shaking a etch-a-sketch of the blooper
And it’s all nuance, a conceptual reiteration of the next move
Its obsessive or repressive propensity, a propeller perpetually ascending
And became fine-tuned, these birds eye views reaffirm what I do
Tonight’s sky so solemn as I glide through it

[Chorus: Henry Canyons]
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
I got half the story, figured out the rest
Told the truth and the lie, I figured let ‘em guess
You know it’s a lie if they say I confessed
I let my corners pressure and dog
I be talking out the side of my neck
They mediocre, I been the best
Don’t wait and say it after I death
Diplomatically suggest, he cracking the flesh
Far be it man, far be it
I’m older than my father when he had me
Not sure if that means I’m doing well or more badly
Sadly the wrong [?] was just [?]
God’s gift shattered it into bits then put in the baggy
Positive thinking turned life in hell to the Simpsons
Patrol men shook like we came for they pensions
Rasta hat with the dreadlock extensions
Pied noir with the [?] pied-à-terre
But now you don’t want no black French man
Just had to fucking mention, just thought I should mention

[Chorus: Henry Canyons]
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got
