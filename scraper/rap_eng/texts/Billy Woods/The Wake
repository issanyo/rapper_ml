[Verse 1]
I stand in this booth of the moment we call now
At the same time pedaling to school as a child
Under a canopy of jacarandas, it ain't change much
Colorful trees still surround us, L's get touched
Baby-faced, staring out the window of the school bus
Twenty years later, same wistful look but shackled up
Bearded down, momma kissed his forehead good luck
Tears anoint the crown
He lied to her anyway and toasted that night over pounds
Sterling, whispers and whirlwinds
Polaroid pictures, edges curling
At the auction
The contents of one storage space site unseen, going once
Sixteen, seventeen, cracking Philly blunts
Half the smarts, but twice the heart
Look at the picture, eyes had a spark
Sputtering, at the bar mutterin'
Money comes and goes
Broke today, but tomorrow who knows?
Ten years ago she was just some ho
Five years after that, I'm in love
And if you ask me today, I could give a fuck
Go figure

[Hook x4]
Ahhhhh

[Verse 2]
Sorry I ain't make the wake, yeah I know
A dollar short, 24 hours late
Trying to live my whole life in '98
Your moms watched me clean my plate
But there ain't no seconds
I'm at the ATM emptying my checking
I'm eleven years old firing a weapon
Dad's hand on my shoulder, smoke in my nose
Got older, went from chocolate to dro
Now if it ain't flight, it's a no go
Bigger, faster, stronger
I seen old friends start working with the po-po
It just goes to show
I could go back tell myself everything I know
But me at 23 would probably shrug a shoulder
Put stoge to fire like you're preaching to the choir
V-Mega was spitting through the wire
Like don't even wet that
It ain't about no get-back
We doing digits on Route 90
Late to your wedding
Sitting in that morning sun with that good Otis Redding

[Outro]
Th-th-th-this music
Th-th-this music
I-i-is so much
I-i-is so much bigger than me
B-b-b-bigger than me
B-b-bigger than me
Th-th-th-this music
Th-th-this music
