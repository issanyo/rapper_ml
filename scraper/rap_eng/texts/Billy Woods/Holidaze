[Verse 1: billy woods]
Back of the bus, I-95, going to meet
The man.  Home for the holidays, frankincense
And haze for the fam
Not quite back in the days, trying to keep the brother ways
Niggas on the lamb
Crime pays and takes back with the other hand
He got smoked, goddamn
I’d seen this brother still with butters
Pushing a land, eating Fudd ruckus, getting
Fat.  Big rims where he move
Got a big gat.  Dime broads, small
Waist, big rack, got it like that
Told me how a couple cats got kidnapped
Duck-taped and electrocuted ‘til they
Gave up the stacks, getting straight jacked
Gary got deported and he ain’t coming back

[Hook: billy woods]
So if you see me pushing, that’s my moms
And if you see me with the dug, that’s the bomb
And if you see me around, I ain’t
Staying long.  Y’all stay strong

[Verse 2: billy woods]
Got love from old co’.  I ain’t gonna
Lie—a lot of niggas I used to fuck with though
Can’t fuck with no mo’
Down here, they get jelly over dro, feel me
Yo?  We all po
Gliding in the Caddy with Maggie, pass
Spots where I used to cop baggies
A lot of peoples doing badly and got
That swing.  Life straight
Clipped their wings.  Old cus-
-tees paging for that thing
Nah, man.  I’m on vacation
This ain’t the old days, Ziplocs in
The basement, a nigga really trying to be
Patient

[Hook: billy woods]
So if you see me
Pushing, that’s my moms
And if you see me with the dug, that’s the bomb
But if you see me ‘round here
I ain’t staying long
Y’all stay strong

[Verse 3: billy woods]
Dropped by to see Shelly.  Homegirl got a full
Belly—like she ain’t got mouths to feed already
What can you say?  Once they’re here
It’s to stay.  Show ‘em love anyway and just
Pray.  For what it’s worth, it’s still love
In every birth, but I can’t lie.  Shelly
Looking cursed, work her fingers to the bone
So them kids grow up alone.  Baby
Father done ‘em wrong, slapped her in front
The kids, and that’s my nigga, you dig?
Something real bad in the air
Like gunpowder.  To all
My peoples under God towers
All the motherfuckers getting six dollars
An hour, I’m going to meet the man
January flowers

[Hook: billy woods]
So if you see me pushing
That’s my moms, and if you see me with weight
That’s on the arm, and if
You see me with a gun, you know what went wrong
Y’all stay strong
