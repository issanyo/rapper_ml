[Verse 1: Elucid]
Hero ain't nothing but a chopped cheese
90 to a car trunk, exotic trees
Grants are going through the bag, baggy jeans
Walk away a 34 AC
Bring me a dream
Squeeze from the hip
Wean from the tit
Schemes through the rich
Skipping your name, nothing seem to stick
Fiening for a lick
Nothing made you, just a blip, ain't it a bitch
Just think, what if you could just-
Lay it on dust
Did it for the rush
Hush tone on landline
White noise Babylon vampire
He a god damn liar
Arrows and AR's, born of chaos, hey y'all
I can't scrub the stain off
This a liberation seance, stay on
Four-headed beast with eight arm-
Lekker lekker
Invoke a name in desperate measures, they who control the weather
Whatever, whatever
AV Navy leather
Naked from the neck up
Stash the Black and Decker
Belook the Mecca
Hex-throwers anonymous
Disaster capital economic shit
The words charged inside an amulet
Doubting Thomas'
No such thing as common sense
Somber tryst, promises

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
It's too late for dialogue man, talk to who?
She ain't raised no fool
I rode through Idaho like duel
This game they don't explain the rules
Packed house, pew to vestibule
Blue vegetables
Earthy, vegetal notes barely legible
But no less true
Like we won't always be cool
This America, somebody gots to lose
“Not I,” said the cat, off went the gat
Let the lawyer litigate while he sit back
The perpetrator was a different shade of black
Beat the case, said let him eat cake in his raps
Service weapon in my face, all I could see was his lips chapped
Wouldn’t recognize him if I saw him today
Chokehold slowly closed the airway
“The sunken place, I can't stay!
You built it on Indian graves!”, the lead character exclaims
Christmas Eve, again with the rattling chains
Marley's ghost, must've been something I smoked
Streets should choke, courthouse overflowed
This shit broke
Could tell he was waiting for us to go, to break out the coke
She said she's still having fun, she'll see me at home
