[Intro: Denmark Vessey]
Yo, thank the Lord
I can recognize a blessing
Yeah, I'm grateful
I'm grateful, I-I swear
I swear, yeah
I appreciate it, like clean air
Yeah, (one) uh
Ya naw mean?
Thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Yeah

[Verse 1: Denmark Vessey]
Thank the Lord the world effed up
Make the common man even fall or step up
Stepped in a power vacuum and got my dick sucked
In the era where the big wigs ain't [?] figs
All the real niggas can't shoot straight, they spray the kids
In this White man world you got two options
Either you Taye Digs or you ain't shit
My inner child's in a school to prison pipeline
Meanwhile I'm like the key in the forty tied to a kite line
Keep it one Benjamin homie, I'm like a zeitgeist
I've turned the wave into a sine after the spike died
DWYCK in my DNA
Free the nipple, eatin pussy right in PETA face
Sue me, I need more light on my rare
Watch your mouth if your jaw like lightning hit sand
Morrey (grateful, yeah grateful)
Thank you Lord for everything you've given me (grateful, grateful)
Thank you universe for everything you've given me (thank you)
(grateful, grateful)
I know what comes with this
I'm grateful, thank you

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Funny thing is they could've just, they could've just left me alone (thank you Lord)
In the streets nobody knows my name
Google cache, I live in the past
Admittedly passe, but they shit for brains
Feel like the Moors in Spain
Easy come, easy go
Nobody tryna hear the poors complain
Get you a bag, young boy
Proof up the doors on that Range
From far away tapes sound like Lebron Flocka James
Come closer for that come-to-Jesus-moment
Your mouth had dried saliva at the corners
Unnerved, I told my White driver keep going
Unperturbed, my Somalian ghost writers kept flowin
Told Scorsese whatever you do, motherfucker, don't you stop rollin'
Chameleons move in stop-motion
How do you not know this?
No questions asked, nobody wants to know
I should know this
Post-coital, errything was so focused
Initially flattered then suspicious how she only wanted Backwoodz
Collect seats wages, pay all applicable taxes
All stars with the patches on the jackets

[Verse 3: Elucid]
Please confirm the humanity
Please, please confirm the humanity
Tongue flickin' the nipple of the motherboard
Me not want war no more
Send the cyborg instead, if you must
Speak but do not tell
Look but do not touch
My other thousand selves, I sold them off before the flood
A negus learn to ride the whale like Jonah in the OT
Surface to air, came up too fast made my nose bleed
Red dot beam at your crows-feet, chrome dream
Tiny hole, slow leak
Like hacks for the simulacrum
Never introduce yourself as a rapper
I own all my masters, even my name
Ash and hash on the limbs of my would be assassins
Shots of sour mash you up
Pretzel structures collapsin'
My rhyme pattern taxin', takin' half
This Black boy magic not rabbit outta Uncle Sam hat shit
Or bootstrap it, make it past my calf
Flash, bang, grenade, I'm on yo' ass
My craft came of age since the pre-millenium tension
This witch face is authentic
Skin of tooth, ten trees take flight, root the roof
Scatter showers, dope balloon latch another maroon
We real cool
