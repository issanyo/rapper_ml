[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Crouched and watched as you sank
Straws snatched off the riverbank
Turnt, the phrase like a shank
Had it stashed by the sinks
Didn't have to come to this, I implored negroes to think
My born date is a jinks
Wait at the gate, I'm a sphinxs
You blinked, paid dearly for those forty winks
Cold as ice, she stayed around the rank
Teeth impossibly white, cheeks pink
Finally suggested we rob him
Immediately switched my math
I do not need them problems
End up counting in the mountains
All jokes aside, my man had a Nigerian accountant
We was rollin', even though by then the cancer had slowed him
Niggas wait till you in the car to tell you it's stolen
Too late to get out, no point asking where you going
This that dumb shit you gotta survive
Just to get to the point of the script where a cop pull you over coming from your nine to five, inexplicably empty the clip

Alternate side parking, I didn't leave the apartment
Alternate side parking, I didn't leave the apartment

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Peace?
Not this evening, it's not even close to even
No rhyme or reason, just open season
Just watch, seeing is believing (is it?)
They won't believe till there's nothing to believe in
He said it wasn't me, we didn't believe him
It's all wearing thin, simple lime and gin till the cup brim
The suit was wearing him
It's another word hidden inside your grin
Big lips make quick work, you wee pin
The arc is long but it do bend, it do bend, it do bend
Alternate side parking, I ain't leave the apartment
I was just starting to start starving, the stick was sharpened
Head split, Percy Harvin
Shade drawn, room dark
But when he spit the room darkened
