Plenty work to do might borrow the Master’s tools

Tiger Blood out Sri Lanka
Nightcap Fernet Branca
40s and blunts with Samuel Doe son

Monrovia’s Prince sip the Can of Kings the air hum redrum give you wings
Served cold like Gazpacho derb fold like tacos knock-knock go the Knockos
No shock they bagged Flaco Slippery slope or slow slalom top of the world, ma
I made it to the bottom watching the Cotton Bowl from a coffeeshop in Holland
Homesick stick-after-stick Super Pollum kept spittin till I got em cause I want em got
It’s all fun and games till I catch you on the uprock it can’t be what it’s not
