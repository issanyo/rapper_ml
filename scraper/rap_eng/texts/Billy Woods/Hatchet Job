[Billy Woods]
These the beats they play for ghost detainees
Weeks with no sleep I’m living the dream
Crabs/hit em with the Old Bay Chesapeake
Steam
At high heat/repeat/red, gold and green
Marcus Garvey/crumbled fronta/Jamaican Rizla
Spanishtown/back to basics, the Spanish Prisoner
Kicking kitchen spanish looking like Sizzla
London Blitz airhorns
He spit that Stalin vs. Hitler

[Elucid]
So goth I was born black
Son trapped within a crux that endorsed crack
Dirt nap before 21 be the forecast
Flown flag half mast
Crass paths ventured
Lucky if you just got stabbed
Limp ginger, flesh wounds still tender
Picking scabs
Block too hot, triage care intensive
Post grad, head of my class expensive
Sessions extended
Reality bites butjakes pinching
Old co defendant, new solo mission
Head spinning
Short glimpses
All city

[Woods]
Staged shooting/Praise God they missed me
Unsolved mysteries/started from the upper middle
Closed the gap quickly
Sold soul to the devil replete with hidden fees
You fucking with a gypsy
White man handshake/twinkle in eye
You caught a bad break
Two half-truths but not one lie
The new guy got my spidey sense in overdrive
Dog, in the grand scheme I was just a cog
Lawyer said forget about getting off
It’s about damage control/ so hot he stop drop & roll
Yet the pack was sold before he copped
King of All Blacks/the new Pac

[Hook]
Had to cut ‘em off, I ain't have no option
They the type to come back with the choppers choppin’

[Elucid]
From apprentice to kingpin
Basshead pipe dreams fenced in
Pinched tims, ends scampi, barely noon reek of cheap brandy
Baggy suit church food pantry
Assembly line, hand to hand
Worst fears, out here a grown man selling candy
Teddy grahams
Rubber band reup
Astronomical scale flipper
Make that fetti fan
Fifty fluttered fitters
Fuck a fair one
Full frontal flared
Banned from tv scanned discreetly
Unseemly means, justified extremes

[Woods]
Nosy neighbors/Rear Window
Rodney Little played by Delroy Lindo
Memories fade like Memento
When someone threatening your kinfolk
Played out/ Super Nintendo
Shylock how he weighed out the super endo
Keep it 100 like loosies
Fishscale raw/ Bolivian sushi
Bargains driven harder than hoopties
Pillar of the community/Kente cloth on the kufi
Liberal white friend played by Donald Sutherland in the movie
Hit Cannes with tanned groupie
Palme d’Or!
Exuberant applause
But I still came back for my money like Mookie
