[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
White kid it didn‘t fit gave it as a gift
Prophet or thug donned with a Fonzie shrug
Ya dig? In the desert holes dug
Cosby sweater Pac leathers Suge gloves
Hold the pen like Sayyid Qutb No Love
Blow me a dub looped up loose lips sink subs
Amphibians swimmin' in primordial sludge
Bricks Ricky Rubio shoot spiteful
Post-Quad Studios American Psycho
Su-Su-Sussudio No Jacket Required
All your heroes wore wires
Quilted liner made in china
Slow night soft light
Gray‘s papaya Nighthawks Diner
Don't let the sidewinders find ya
Makaveli Pelle Pelle pepper sprayed R. Kelly
Hood Ebay be the Yemeni Deli
Copped stadium coats pig in a poke
Ill repute and little note
Gloat in a cloud of wood smoke
Slow roast the scapegoat
Stakes is low

[Chorus: Elucid]
I am but a mortal still the highest under
I am but a mortal still the highest under
Fundamentally T.H.U.G
Can't take it as it comes
They don't want me to feel
They don't want me to love
I am but a mortal still the highest under
I am but a mortal still the highest under
Fundamentally T.H.U.G
Can't take it as it comes
They don't want me to feel
They don't want me to love

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
First world problems got you shot in the noggin
Grand opening grand closing grams is golden
General Mills deals inside Florida Avenue grill
Lanyard had his license to ill, expired but still
Shakur sport coat convinced your daughter to elope
Woke to Greenpeace boarding the boat
Shellfish in barrels Shark Nigga Apparel tuna in brine
Judge books by the spine
Seems like I'm crashing on couches but this is interior design
Four hundred of your Gregorian paradigm
Damn right I'm on Colored People Time
Consultancies on GP audible gasp at the consultancy fee
Autograph the enhanced CD
Fuck can you really tell me
Fire sale on the Shelbyville Monorail
See you in hell before I see you in jail
Read her areolae like braille
They explained the ship sailed
Chainmail 2Pacalypse later windbreaker
Waiter said collards the new kale

[Chorus: Elucid]
I am but a mortal still the highest under
I am but a mortal still the highest under
Fundamentally T.H.U.G
Can't take it as it comes
They don't want me to feel
They don't want me to love
I am but a mortal still the highest under
I am but a mortal still the highest under
Fundamentally T.H.U.G
Can't take it as it comes
They don't want me to feel
They don't want me to love
