[Intro: Sample from Big Trouble in Little China (1986)]
[Jack Burton] Wait a minute, wait a minute
I’m a reasonable guy but I’ve just experienced some very unreasonable things

[Bridge: Vordul Mega]
Yeah, get your microphone
Yeah, yo, dig it, yeah, here we go

[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
Guarded by the right, guarded by the left
Up and down produce a body of positive
Life through struggle, truth sincere
Made it through the years, in our lives, we were
Drinkers, munchers, shoot 40s at a time
Now we cool deuces of beers, me and my
Dudes cruising the waves, getting blazed
Talking ‘bout who we gon' stick today
Matter fact, let’s get paid from raps
Evade the rats in the race
Survivor trying to find a place
On the map and hit you off just like that
Whoever you are, think you gassed up?
Wait ‘til we light fires and blow your ass up
Me and my team equally get cream
And flood your whole scene, build and grow homes where we
Cultivate and smoke green (green, green)

[Bridge: Vordul Mega]
Like that, it’s like that, y’all

[Verse 2: billy woods]
How you don’t know me? You know all those times
I sold you trees, danced on screens plasma
Newports, asthma-head ticked pastor
We blowtorch your stanza, would-be Panthers
But just black, got anger, diabetes
And cancer, can’t drive to the church—no answers
Every man thinks his burden is the heaviest
Guns to head like, “Who the readiest?” Then, nigga
Kool-Aid is the deadliest, and we sip
Mixed with hard licks, holding our dicks
Like, “All I got is this,” feet like
"We need whips," Guns asking for clips, cops
Asking, “Where that shit?” A white lady
Told me she never owned no slaves and you gotta work to get paid, now that’s comedy
Like we sailed ourselves across these waves
