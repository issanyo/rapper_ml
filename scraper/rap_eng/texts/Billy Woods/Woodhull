[Verse 1]

Time turtles hurdled into Dante's first circle
100 meter hurdle Pompeii, Wyckoff Myrtle
Homeless tempers flare over plastic chairs half squared
Bust down to [?Airs?] for which I'm aware
Blank stare desk duty bored seen it all before all aboard
Uninsured test results rekindle faith in the lord
Gun shot wounds, shackled to gurney
Guarded by goons plea for attorney [?it fits in the tombs?]
Babylon cat food Saturday morning cartoons
Emergency room beep half dead sand in the beach
Beg for the priest, off this food you won't last a week
Diabetes snatch the feet
Take a number, gnash teeth
Stab victim, clutch your stomach
Front of the line, that's a come up
Scalded baby, mom distraught, boyfriend cagey, crazy
Sick rabies, old ladies alone, bundled up against the cold
Feel bad but you best not go before me though
Hold yak on speakerphone
Extra trifling like we really want to know
Lady shook her head, said "Damn shame no training at home"
No surprise neighbors trying to kick game
She struck Heisman pose eyes groping the thighs
I'm no better close captioned telenovela
Let me tell ya
Bed-Stuy, do or die, not just a rap line
It's policy, fill out forms, retrieve their property
Bent like apostrophe
All apologies outside radiology

[Outro]
