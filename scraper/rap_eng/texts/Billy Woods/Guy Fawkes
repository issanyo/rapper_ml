[Hook: Privilege]
Kids ate all their spinach plus the broccili raw
Had hustlers moving [Mark fire!]
Same as factories that sit on Brooklyn waterfront properties
Investors sparking [Mark fire!]
For so many Sunni insurgents victory's a slow ride
Now martyrs taking [Mark fire!]
And if the super flight flames fanned in foreign faces feel federal will fate infest 'em
[Mark fire!]

[Verse 1: Trife da God]
Ey yo this story takes place in the heart of New York
Where if you get caught slipping it's a part of your fault
You never know what kind of mishaps they day gonna bring
Pawns coming up, thinking they could take on kings
When I was young we was popping gum
Now they popping guns, dropping young
Shorty looking at me like he not the one
Seen him on the strip by six getting his diesel on
Clocking chips, big four-fifth, getting his eagle on
He put his people on, created a crew
And through the years yo, his street credibility grew
He was a runner now he got runners running for him
Plus niggas he used to work for now they coming to him
Niggas from the other side murdered one of his men
Caught him right in front of papi's, popped one in his brim
Plus he shook him in, at the funeral, now he looking slim
Viewed the world from the outside now he looking in (in in in in)

[Priviledge]
They say real downtown, I found poison I'm extracting on the daily
Similarly to the oil that I funnel into barrels
Keep it moving, selling bulk to the European Union
Cause Euros spend damn near good as pounds round the ball these days
And the haze ain't forgot 'em
Ran into the Edge and got his egg poached dope rotten
No top towing with these rap town toddlers
Gotta get gregarious greetings grieving with greedy gimme ya'll like the guy they got in genesis
Grimace at the thought of giving gifts grounds for getting, and I'm reticent
I'm still medicine balls cracking your pedestals
Mining these falls idols in regular holes
Cause what is a nation without it's treasure troves?
Just like a player without no broads
Or a bong with no Chong and Cheech
And the song with the longest reach
And no eager teachers is teaching, preaching what they see in living, day to next
Unbated breath, and im stressed and give it a rest
And im razzling, razzling with moves like psychic
Grab Poseidon's Triton like thorn lightning cause

[Billy Woods]
He's a man of few words and a great many names:
Billy Clint on 153rd, Bodega and Bahrain
Wu Chang, aka the Black Bird, the Chinese counterfeiters
The Ukraine's Dr. Strangelove
Who passed the poison to Hitler as Berlin was burning
Apprentice to Merlin
Even the Hindenburg manifest signed "Mr. Africa" with perfect penmanship
The foreigner: a nondescript character at first glance
Who got everything from Callahans to exotic plants
Only stipulation is cash in advance
Stop – and telegram
Many claim to be down but like Masaui they were never really part of the plan
These ships in Malawi
Contraband in Thailand and the embargo is on in Iran
So I can see how money's not the issue
Once the check clears get you past Mogadishu
Warheads for those missiles
Humans trafficked by the kilogram, middle name discretion
On the far side fresh off the boat
Hagar the Horrible got Blondie in the oldest profession
Family circus encouragable
Andy Capp in the Boondocks, witness protection
Ain't shit comical, they 'bout that daily paper
Put players on ravers and they'll never wave us 'til that Vegas line changes
Consignment? Don't do 'em no favors
Columbian pilots thinking that they hauling bales of Jamaican
But the hull's full of undocumented Haitians
That's international relations, that's immigration and naturalization
He got aliens patiently waiting at 8-mile to body snatch your white christ
And in the Congo he sold arms to loyalists and rebels alike
So there's little sympathy for the devil, but it's never his head on the pike
A rolling stone gathers no moss
And not one of those arraigned could identify the boss
