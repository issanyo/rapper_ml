[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
I saw her on 23rd and Broadway today
Said she met somebody but I ain't do nothing but smile in her face
Like "You feeling him? that's great"
But for a heartbeat, I wonder what she'd say
If i told her I loved her, wouldn't let her go away
Like I'm willing to work with if that means you stayed
But I ain't say a thing, I just smiled in her face
Ugly, pretty perhaps listening party in Dodge City
Imagine cue up the track me and Edge passed L's in the back
Merry and berry, heard one cut
Stood up then said "Flight Brothers got that crack!"

[Verse 2: Privilege]
Huh - so what you need pens for when you don't rap
Ain't no more old school breaks and boom bap
Illiterate shit, push mics like Sisyphus
Up literary hills, literally
Landscape match Tuscan topography in Italy
Meditate with a Mediterranean tree olive and feta cheese, so Greta please
Watchu know about ghetto sellers, franks and beans?
Mayonnaise sandwiches and Tetley Tea
We're far from scones and crumpets
Same family like trombones and trumpets
Hobos and bag ladies, Fraggles and Muppets
Jack-offs and bloody wankers, who crump without me?
Motherfucking paper, what a waste of time
Dark days spent waking life
Spent shaking strife from the pain of minds
10:30 show with a painted bride

[Verse 3: Billy Woods]
If it's over 40, I need time and a half
Since it's short, he quit the rhyme for a laugh
Four wheel fast, punch in, spit balderdash, punch out, tip the flask
Loosen the tie at the bus stop, nicotine device in mouth
Time flies in a flash when making $4.25
Puff puff but don't pass
Saturday night live, switch the plates lets fly
Black mask, tools grasped, party crash the gala
Robbing like Sherwood, no fast moves in my hood
Cash rules, pint glass full so I can play the fool
My advice: stay in school, hit the books good and marry that girl already
Option two, bake the pies, stay on the grass
Tell Mom a few white lies, hit the ground running
Ride the riptide like a slip and slide - once burned, twice shy
But finding great pride dumbing with homie and cousin
Gotta prepaid, gotta throw away cell
Switch math every ten days, game hotter than hell
Going grade ain't hard to tell
Good times had by all
Two nines had them boys bird call
Admittedly I had a ball ya'll but I gotta be out on rope ladders attached to helicopters
Don't forget the way Woods fade away
All they could say is that the dro was hella proper
Plus the flow dangerous like Chinese choppers, unlicensed doctors
M. Bison in the streets, Mike Tyson at the opera
Top shotta since the principal had to pop his locker
Billy Dee Williams, how I cold cocked her
Sound good on paper neighbor but real capers pulled in sky scrapers
Now who the mack?
Goldie, Shaft, Sweet Motherfucking Sweetback
My verse will get those blunts cracked
I can see in red, black, gold and green
'Catch Me If You Can' - nah mean?

[Verse 4: Privilege]
Blowing in the wind, same as Maui Wowie
Bask in the starlight like Stella
It's Bobby's World, Cape Town with Howie Mandela
(So how's your fella?)
Barely relevant, scarcely intelligent
Enough to bluff with the likes of crime dog McGruff
Royal flush, Texas don't hold 'em enough
Illadelph came through and rigged the back of that pick up truck
To this burl we stumped, sitting on Curly's trunk
Lots of gold, 800 English, lots of Olde
Niggas drunk it down 'til they extra bold
Watch those lips like Smith in Hitchcock in Birds
What I'm seeing through my rear window's absurd
Yo, in these real streets dog
M for Murder To Catch a Thief
Super crime hoof, Andy Griffith's beat, yo
M for Murder To Catch a Thief
