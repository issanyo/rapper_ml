[Verse: Billy Woods]
Fried death washed down with Coke
Comfortable how I post, divided the gross
At four they kitchen table Surrounded by ghosts
Ghanaian grandmother watching American soaps
"Yo, she don't speak no English?"
He shrugged like let's go
As far as the rest don't really remember
Being honest it's just another day in September
Looking back he knew it was over when he said
"Chances are slender."
What composure?
Bury me at sea
One last photograph stiffed in blood streaked
Bury Me a G on repeat
Your story don't add up like Warren G
Genuflected
Grabbed the feat, heaved him in on three
Each man sinks with the sum of they deeds
Cassette tapes delivered by couriers, the consolutes anonymous
A great weight lifted, yet felt listless
Ocean bottomless
Save the date down there with the crabs and octopus
Set the bait, wait, watching yourself through binoculars
