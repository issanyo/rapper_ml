[Verse 1: Elucid]
Poppy cop, snot boxed, a bible trying to parley clout
Fly me on the fire twice
Send flowers for the molliwhop
Body, I...  pump a hottie, I just be trying to line it up
Knock it down, domino, bondage Imma try my luck
Diamond dust up out the envelope
Why are you living true? Look what a liar wrote
Locked up in the groove, empire state iron cloak
Cliff diver I need much higher than required dosage
Flesh prison going through the motions
Not a genius but I had a notion
Duly noted by your throat
Smoking out the culprit, all your guys I heard are ghosted
Five fifths stamped on a knuckle proper postage
I know worlds, I know oceans
Every queen through some old shit, yeah that’s cool though
Assume not an operation
Take steps before you make that pussy gape kid
You made a human, that’s collaboration
Somebody said don’t put the date in the rhyme
This ain’t no affidavit

[Verse 2: billy woods]
Smoke machine
I roll like fog off the lake
Hopes and dreams stream for whatever you wanna pay
Play my tape in the Madrasa
They went to wake the Sheikh, ask “should I wait or..?”
Fuck it cut to the chase
The money imaginary I'll send it to your phone
Kick in your door to drive the point home
What percentage of your mortgage in the form of a loan?
What do you really own?
Blood from a stone
What I told collection while wiping cappuccino foam out the beard, like how do you reckon?
Nice church you got here, be a shame if something were to happen
Yup, even God paid protection
Reject the concept of interest on debts
Rubber cheques
The fetish is
ATM like a pussy the money still wet
Bit her lip
Blood money in a pimp piss test
Glass shoe fit the princess
Winked at the audience right when the plot twist
Only game in town so sit the fuck down, ain't no nets
Ran in the bank like Jimmy Stewart
Surround the bank J. Edgar Hoover
The machine shudder, bolts rattle looser
In God you trust it's not just numbers in a computer

[Outro: billy woods]
Told the money lenders I can do you one better
Washed or unwashed in that river, to the land the lamb tethered
Disemboweled rams, the damned sit in splendor listening to the wind howl

Told the money lenders I can do you one better
Washed or unwashed in that river, to the land the lamb tethered
Disemboweled rams, the damned sit in splendor listening to the wind howl
