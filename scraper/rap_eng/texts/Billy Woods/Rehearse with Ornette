[Hook: Billy Woods]
All that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Hole in his brain, hole in his brain

[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Every victory pyrrhic, every live show forget the lyric
Forty doing Tae Bo
Who'd've guessed this be how I finished
To everyone who got caught, I'm there in spirit
This is where the winners say it ain't no winners in this game
But easy to say when you winning
Gravy spilling, turkey all the trimmings
Shook me awake in the clubhouse
Nigga, it's the ninth inning
Ridin' dirty in a lemon
Semper Fi, waving weapons at the peasants
Hearts and minds that don't work
Start squeezing off one at a time
(Hole in his brain, hole in his brain)
Just running 'round having fun, Brett Favre with the gun
Count bars on fingers like I'm doing sums
Off the one, beg producers to take out the drums
I'm done, call grown men young, call old men son, old men son
She let it be known to Puerto Rico woes is a no
Steve Biko through his peoples he would never let it go
Both teams asking "what happened?"
I'm demure with an African accent
Even his message drafts got the malware attachment

[Hook: Billy Woods]
All that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Only came back to tell 'em 'bout them fuckin' flames
Sayin', all that he seen burnt a hole in his brain
Hole in his brain, hole in his brain

[Verse 2: Elucid]
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out a warning
Super predator era veteran, I'm a warden
Silent weapon for quiet war, radical forces
Your favorite rapper's a corporate shill
Who dresses like a banker in they spare time
Don't you dare compare mine
Non-cipher, hands off, dirty bomb, faulty timer, poof
Buckshot, shorty slang, 19-naughty never mane
Three-quarters share the lever, jux you for a better chain
Niggas seeing green like Donnie Simpson
Reverse weave white hoodie all-American lynching
Convinced niggas is lost causes
And caught the fact that this ain't for us
I'm in a constant state of rage
Elder ways, I'm off this, blood and orchids
Fifty people at a rap show, one's an informant
Niggas scared to be their self, whole life's a performance
I pity the fool, fuckboys deserve to be liberated too
Cool skin brothers Madonna thought
If she feeling that way you might get watch, free entry
Complementary shackle, punch for refreshment
Catch me outside, happy land the exit
Past dues in your soda collection
Who gon' check me from the neck up?
Keloid scar, just get the check cut
