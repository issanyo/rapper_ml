[Intro]

[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Haze and the Dutch across the room
First I didn't think much
Highed-up and blazed still recognised Dominican perfume
Naturelle Riviera octoroon showered candy
It was like cartoons, Pep√© Le Pew
It was like time didn't move for the count of one (one) two (two)
Then we're flying
I'm hoping you don't ask the wrong questions
I really don't want to start lying
In bed not sleeping she teasing
Legs spread mouth wet seasonal fruit
Stepped to my head like the perfect loot
Slow burn smokey eyes lotion thighs
Suddenly realising you're alive
Like one day I'm gonna die but right now I'm alive
Smell you on my pillows blackberry kush billows
People nosey like "is that your girl though?"
I'm like "chill chill, plenty other flowers I'm feeling still"
Fronting for real like yeah she bad but I need that killer kill
Truth is when she around it's ill how words spill
But we don't have to say a thing just let that blue sing

[Hook: L'wren]
You know you had me from the very start
And in my heart I thought we'd never part
Hazy days mix red and green
Purple nights of those blue dreams

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
So much unsaid
We only keep it real when we joking
Not getting high still smoking
Somewhere along the line stopped trying to try and started going through the motions
That day-to-day got you on some "happy to see you after work, here's a kiss"
But by bedtime I got a headache that just won't quit
Even worse in the morning
If it ain't this it's that if it ain't raining it's pouring
Predictable and boring
Plus got me 'noided
It's getting annoying all that effort nulled and voided
Zero sum game if you're at home scoring
Blood pressure soaring
Maybe I shouldn't blame you but I do
Whatever, you blame me for all your shit too
Who knew after all we've been through
It'd come down to this wack petty shit
When we met we was just kids and even now that it's over
I would still hit

[Hook: L'wren]
You know you had me from the very start
And im my heart I thought we'd never part
Hazy days mix red and green
Purple nights of those blue dreams
You know you had me from the very start
Purple nights and those blue dreams
