The Reavers (ft. Hasan Salaam and billy woods) - “Invasion”
[Produced by DJ Marmaduke]
[Scratches by DJ Emagine]

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
Yeah
Gather your thoughts and take notice.  I’m focused
Holding the staff of Moses, bringing the plague of locusts
Break my opponents down in exponents
I wrote this so pissed like Deepak Chopra
The smoke’s to cope with the fiends and culprits
D’s want us in the belly like that whale of Jonas
It seems so hopeless, so I toast Coronas
With my queen and plant seeds when she opens her lotus
My shoulders hold the weight of the world like Atlas
Pen touch the canvas, so you could catch visions like
Saul on the road to Damascus. At last, this
To shepherd the greener pastures, I’ll unearth the hatchet
Watch your back, kid

[Verse 2: billy woods]
Wipe down the ratchets.  Invasion of the mic snatchers
Pirate the radio in eyepatches.  Land-loving
Bastards walk planks backwards, pour salt
In the gashes.  Never pour malt in glasses—strictly sour mashes
My verse splashes, tsunami the cords
Twisting rain forest.  Tyrannosaurus, your arms
Too short to slap-box with Horus.  Sun shining
Spit at the swords, flash like diamonds on Namibian sands
He touched the rocks?  Chop his hands.  Spot cops
On the block, drop the grams, flop their plans
Artest-pop a fan out the stands.  Just to va-
-cation with my clan, Rhodesia, buy dollar van
In Africa, we patient, fam.  "Things Fall Apart"
We take the pieces and make art.  And, with Sayyid, I took
His thesis and made darts.  "Shanty Towns,” new
Desmond Dekkers, stacks to that mega drawing believers like
Mecca.  Form like Mecca, Castro lecture
[?] bodega

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]
Yeah.  Yo
Perverts run the church.  Espionage in the synagogues
Truth is camouflaged behind the veils of demagogues
Epilogue to the Genesis scarred
By blemishes.  Are you remnants [?] but sentient?
[?].  Strike my nemesis
With the wrath of God while I ride the track
Like the back of a Pegasus.  Emphasis felt from
Jersey to Ephesus.  Earth is reflecting this
Heavenly body on three-fourths of Her surfaces
The purpose is clear: exertions of fear
Destroying all your false idols like Easter was here
Vegetarian—nah, I’ll make beef disappear
My heart beat with the snare and the verses is like
The angel Gabriel appear and beatbox in my ear
The future is clear.  No fear, I swear
To throw the truth out there like Zulu spears
Yeah
