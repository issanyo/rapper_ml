Here we are on a planet which is about five thousand million years old.  The sun around which it goes is not much older.  It is part of a galaxy which is perhaps ten or twelve thousand million years old, which is one of perhaps hundreds of thousands of millions of other galaxies

[Hook x2]
Rolled the dice
Fucked around, lost your life
Double or nothing, it's only right
It's only right
It's only right!

[Verse 1]
Campaign code as coterie of the cold
Keep us on point
Blasphemy how he cracked the Cohiba for a makeshift joint
Asked no questions, she told no lies
Afterward came by gold flex on the dies
Lucid dream gone when I open my eyes
All substance controlled you sell in Dubai
Gutted inside like a brownstone in Bed-Stuy
Relaxed while Rome burned, head full of lye
Both eyes dry
Lead-line bunker, limited air supply
Both hands high
Explaining how I came unstuck in time
So ain't none of that mine
Eight lives down 'fore he thought 'bout number nine
'Fore he thought 'bout number nine

[Hook x2]
Rolled the dice
Fucked around, lost your life
Double or nothing, it's only right
It's only right
It's only right!

[Verse 2]
Starting with the man in the mirror
Morris Day and I might jack thriller
Nerve tonic, tip it in sasparilla for ya
Pipe crack said "kid, this stuff will kill ya"
Lay hands like Faith Hill over light skinned shilla
The local skeezer but, shit, I ain't nobody either
Sweet talkin' son of a preacher
Weed hockin'
Shot over sneakers
Died for nothing but I've seen 'em go cheaper
Nowadays full buffet for sin eaters
Woke and wrote Kubla Khan
Or how I learned to stop worrying and roll the ball
Even though forty years had him reluctant to farm
Unbearable likeness at the end of your arm
Waiting to palm, call em
Mr. Lion versus Mr. Marv with the iron
But the work was worthless

[Hook x2]
Rolled the dice
Fucked around, lost your life
Double or nothing, it's only right
It's only right
It's only right!

She asked my name I said "Blah blah blah"
She asked if that's game I said "Not really, nah"
Layaway Carhartt buggin over battle for Asgard
Yo Mars you rock that beat like an ascot
Good lord
You gripped the wired jaw
After the arriganment as arranged
You came home, locked the door
Unscrew the drug jar
Pocket carry like days of yore
The prices will vary with fiends seeking that raw
Freebase religion, stovetop superstition
I ran with the fish
And then hunkered down for that war of attrition

In our tenure on this planet we have accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage.  Propensities of regression, ritual, submission to leaders, hostility to outsiders, all of which puts our survival at risk
