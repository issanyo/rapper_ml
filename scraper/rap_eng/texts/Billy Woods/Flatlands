[Verse 1]
Camera roll through stone cold choke hold, the bell tolled
In the ground you go
Yellow summons by the headstone
Mourners head home through dead zone, put money on the phone
Brothers on the steps throwing bones
Chipping stones, cheap sweat, snake eyes, shots fly, just a heat check
Twelve drive by, natives throw hex multi threats, flee back to Teaneck
Kiss his kids as they slept, niggas got arms like a T-Rex
Monstrosities are bound in this town, where evil laughs at capers
Hear a cop got shot, say "good", go home, think on that later

[Hook]
Parked outside the house
Negroes scared to go out (go out, go out, go out)
Sitting in front of the crib
Neighbors scared to come in (repeat x4)
