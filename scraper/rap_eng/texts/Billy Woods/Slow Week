[Verse]
Having a laugh
Mugabe in a DOOM mask
Even if you win they run it back like sound clash
About to go in like canine found a ground stash
Groundhog's Day and your team tiny drag
That's no way to live
Nothing lived all the way
Landlord want the rent
And victim bumped my friend what happened next
Happens every other day
Deep water, Spalding Gray
Sink under grey wave
And she got hold and my momma started to pray
Seen bible on night stand
And felt some type of way
Meanwhile first of every month I gots all the hell to pay
That's what I get for trying to do the right thing
This shit right here better work like skin lightening cream
Uncut dope that'll front you things
Went for self, no "I" in "team"
Sold hope, we had no dreams
No plan but plenty schemes
Look ma, no hands
Clapped M16 on empire's edges
Empty magazine, get Tec with beam, they get the message

[Outro]
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow leak
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow leak
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow leak
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
It's a slow week
