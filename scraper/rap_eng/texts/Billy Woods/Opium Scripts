[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
On the strip, flying in a Nissan Z
Zested off that Rafael Saadiq
Blasted, bass turned up
Got the Donatello headband and glass caskets
Put it in the air!
Kissing the sky
Hailing at the world
Hands up high
Suicide doors is Ridermus Prime
Circling through the hood

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Keys in the ignition so I can ride around shining
Trees in the system, I fly around driving
Destined to stay living as I lay dying
Told the priest "What you're slinging, I ain't buying"
Love at first sight when I saw that hunk of pig iron
'86 LeSabre, wooden dash
Got the papers, paid in cash
Gave her some gas, 3 AM, Georgia Ave
Camouflage in clouds of grass
Open bar, safari
We all splash in pools Olympic
Open container, Castrol syntex

[Hook: Vordul Mega]
My mind is a horizon
And space is
Smoke so many blunts that my mouth
Becomes cake mix
Elixed with liquors and toxin
The Ox again
King cobras and the lions den
Tiger
Opium Scripts

[Verse 3: Vordul Mega]
Be phoenix, spidey
Mega-apocalyptic
Writing scripts
Megagraphitti
Death in which
One can't understand and can't reach, preach
All eyes seeing
Physically human being, vein
Experimented in extended
Lending a hand
And then them
B.C. animal
Eat like Cannibal

[Hook; Outro]
