[Verse 1 - Billy Woods]

Somehow he fucked up the count
I pocketed difference and bounced
See me in the sky dancing
No ceiling
In for a penny, in for a pound
Liquor store door headshot
No stealing in broken English
White man say he bought the ground
[?] Show him the fine print
Pandora's door was open when she came in
Highest I ever got was the bottom of the pyramid
Highest I ever got was holding the bag and wondering what if I just stiffed?
Flow's like the mould
Tide's cold
A star in the void, like the more you know
Carny's bargain
Guess how much black mould your tenament hold
Hmm, are the tenant's negro?
Either way, never much of a scold
Not the one to tell shawty, slow your road
The kid was keen
Made the inception
Take it from me, go get that degree
He dropped out, got rich as can be
Seen him grinning on TV, all I said was, My G, under my breath
Sip tea, it's none of us left
Light skinned niggas chucking threes, I wish 'em the best
Beyond God's law some exist
Summer's trist turned winter slog
That's why you don't invade the USSR
Saw son serve it raw, vaping on our own board
Genuflected knees to a king
Gave him his first little necklace

[Verse 2 - Elucid]

If not mine, then whose?
That's just the view that made news
Proof not seen
Why they come for me, though?
Freeload, we know
Don't play the hero
Oldschool, household smell like soulfood
Slow stew
Spoon over pearl couscous
Onion loop, bundled herb
[?] the cauldron out the speed
All that with a whole bird plus the giblets
Black all Peas, with a capital P
[?] by miraculous means
Shackles clink
Climbin' pineapple trees, why?
Please say what I mean
Bask by the sargasso sea
What's gon' be gon' be
[?] told me to tell y'all
[?] hockin' through the moon roof
Lookin' at self preservation at another level
You feel bad in your birthday outfit
Time costs more now
Thaw down
Take me to your lizard king
Manchild, hand style, pull pup string
Gangbang Earth
First and the last
Is it worth coming back?
Accustomed to the culture of cotton
And then there was crack

By that human part, sometimes, I tend to want to suppress. Because, the human part with me might say, Mosia, who killed my daughter in law? I should go and shoot them. The human part might say I must go around looking for the Kleinhans brothers, and shoot them. But the revolutionary in me says, it's over
