It's a good night, I won't go gently
Told the bartender "don't let my glass empty"
That Rhodes Fender volume on twenty
Break loud down on the table cloth
If it's the last night; fuck it, going hard
No if, and's, fam, every spliff three grams
Raise my hand, watch her do her thing but I don't dance
I don't dance, don't dance, I don't don't dance

Hook:
Fuck last call, put my song on [x8]

No tears we had a hell of a run
No fear, my forefinger and thumb
Strum violins, ?"surely ain't set"? to "say when"
Grin, when lights dim, watch her spin
Oysters and gin
No check tonight your money don't spend
Familiar friends, some faces I ain't expect to see again
No questions, glad you made the session
To your health, shots smooth as hell
She's still dancing by herself
Eyes closed, sways to the beat
And you know me, but tonight
I just might, I just might, I just might

Hook
