[Chorus]
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight

[Verse 1]
Police came to my show tonight paid the cover price
Soon as I seent em I knew something wasn’t right
Plainclothes but the nose knows ya boy don’t doze
No matter how the dro glow ya boy stay woke
Ain't hard to tell
Empty venue and you gettin paid offa door sales
Drain pale ale “Mo, you good to go? Let’s get this
Coffin nailed”
Top hat and tails tap shoes case I haveta make bail
They smirk smilin’ I’m dialed in on an island
Peeling songs ceiling gone tour muscles strong
People sparse, but they in the palm in the zone
Inside the park and I made it home
Cap tipped to the crowd
Whoever knew the lyrics
And in that spirit ran back out
And took a bow

[Chorus]
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight

[Verse 2]
Wanted to know if they got they money worth
But both slipped out after my last verse
Zero merch sales later I’m at the bar
Seltzer water omeprazole chaser
Original plan was pay the piper later
But as it turns out he bout his paper
Promoter insisted one for the road
“Thought folks would come out but you never know”
I replied so it goes
Peace to famous rappers who let me open they shows
Green room green tea honey in the teaspoon
Green leaf pruned rolled and creased
Fruit and cheese plate I ate all the dates
Backstage homie like “bro that was great”
Half my ages trying to trade cassette tapes

[Chorus]
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
And I did it up
Police came to my show tonight
