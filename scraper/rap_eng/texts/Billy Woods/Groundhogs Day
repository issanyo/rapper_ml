Plug said he’s taking a break, I couldn’t keep a straight face
‘Til he explained how they came for the safe
I was like, “wait, wait, wait”

I wake up and smoke weed
I wake up and smoke weed

I’m how come we don’t have nice things
Put the chopper to Ethiopia last king
That’s what this thing of ours bring
Got Addis Ababa jumping like the Bada-Bing

I wake up and smoke weed
I wake up and smoke weed

Put my apartment on the curb
Worse for the wear
And left a Pharoah’s curse for whoever next there
Lost a verse in the move, had to write it again
Tried to change things up, but came to the same small end

I wake up and smoke weed
I wake up and smoke weed

Last thing to go was that old cathode ray tube
Fucking huge was the shit when it was new
Chinatown delivery cubes, peep show booths
Someone would kick the screen in that same afternoon

I wake up and smoke weed
I wake up and smoke weed

Had the talent, missed your shot
Hard one to swallow, but it can’t be what its not
No intricate plot needed to put you in a box
Whether pacing or laid out front the congregation
Anyone can get knocked

I wake up and smoke weed
I wake up and smoke weed

Underachieved, still considered one the greats
I’m from the era of Reggie Miller 8’s
Nothing to be proud of, but I still am!
Truth be told, I remember every single gram
Wrote his epitaph on the back of the master plan
Just in case, even though he know the place like the back of his hand

The trees look so good, but the price is so heavy
I don’t know
I’d rather talk to your plug first, but negroes is petty
So here we go!
