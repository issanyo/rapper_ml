When them other niggas jumped ship, we kept it Amistad
Still ended up in front a white judge, praying to God
I owe much, have nothing, leave the rest to the poor
Vegetation lush, Dutch Candy, New York Giants at the door
On some Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum your electric bill is quite the sum
Smile. Light the blunt
Last moment in the spotlight, it's only right you should stunt
Get bonded out, put up that brave front
Mom's put up the house, so you know you can't run
Cracks start to show, weeks turn to months
Lawyer says they want time, DA is a cunt
Reality won't hit till you up in them bunks
With cats that's gassed cause it's Hamburger Helper for lunch
Face bashed, CO's knuckles usually chuckle last
Mention the past, all you'll get is a Woody Woodpecker laugh

[Junclassic][Hook]
Exchanging mary jane and bad words
Can't believe this lame brain even had the nerve
Make me squeeze the flame
And leave ya name upon da curb
Another brother slain from his famous last words
The say that my wrath and my actions disturbed
Madness occurred but my past is a blur
Laught at the aftermath of accidents and worst
The first shall be last
And the last shall be first
Cursed

On the bubble
Think they cooking crack in ginger ale
These niggas gay rocking tight jeans and fingerwaves
They bring a knife to a gunfight
I bring grenades
Get on some Dnaiel Boone shit
And skin ya face
Hit ya man point blank range you catch a stray
A little ricochet may
Hit him click 'em lick 'em
Leave 'em leaking in the paint
I'm getting paid for slanging blades
Y'all Kind 'n Play and only call me monster
Cause you been afraid
Gatorade can't quench this thirst
When you see ya family approach the bench it hurts
'specially when they contradict your words
In the church bullets burst get your limbs disperesed
Listen jerk I anin't no slave for prison work
Inject your earth but you the one there when she giving birth
Appartheid rhymes with no Mandela with de Klerk
I eat your face
I eat you food
And then I eat dessert
Word!

I'll settle for The Post, but ideally the Times
Tell 'em I said something, make sure it rhymes
Churchill with cigars, words to stiffen spines
Lists like Chirstmastime, you know I'm getting mines
Due dilligence means, your box is pine
Ground is soft, it'll be fine, body's going off
Brought a pound of quicklime, ounce of Strawberry Cough
That's air feshner for the Jetta
Put a beggar on horseback, he'll ride to hell
I ain't pay twenty bones to hear you spit accapell
One is for the money, two is qui pro quo
Ripped the afterparty after he skipped the show
Force 'em to work together, hammer & sickle logo on the Polo
Ivory soap, Gold Medal Flour, desperate to blow
End up left for the crows
Mississippi Goddamn
Shoot coward, you are only going to kill a man
