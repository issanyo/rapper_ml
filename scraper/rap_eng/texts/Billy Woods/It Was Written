[Verse 1: billy woods]
Yeah, yeah
Picture me rolling, man
You only dream pictures
Snake-devoured tails, circle vicious
Search for words like how can I put this
When this itself is amorphous
One set of footprints out the valley look gorgeous
Gorgeous, afterlife's bored as porous
Monotheists built a fortress
This a landline, it's just cordless
You never heard a dial tone in your life
You never laid awake for that call in the night
Wish you dreamt it all
My father's killer came to make right
I heard him and my mother through the hall
Still see it like neanderthal wall, not no written language
They said the greats ain't write shit they just poured out they anguish
And the Henny flowed like rivers
And the blunts was like Shaq's fingers
And mens was men, bitches was bitches
All was paradise until the first one started snitching
It was written

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Yeah, yeah
Terror in the name of law and order
Somrsault walk burnt clubfoot caustic
Pigeon toe feel nigga how to reach corporate
Pork belly future, ripe abortion
Dancing underwater but not getting wet
Shackle on neck, I woke erect
Knew right or wrong before the right of correction
Had to move on, they couldn't answer my question
My discography is a radical act of love and protection
From chaos, bomb blast blown in every which direction
Put on the whole armor, get back before karma
Send out a word, adrenaline surge, first Intifada
Who taught you manhood, my nigga?
You never met your father (Probably wasn't shit anyway)
A popular opinion, but let's be honest
What's the difference between a threat and a promise?
Who the fuck want what
Unanswered question we've been asking for the longest
For the longest stabbing off the hook, collection cordless
Made a bed of black orchids in the Leviathan's fortress
It's 2017 and Flint still ain't got clean water
Cough up a lung where I'm from
There were many, there were none
Off the head, you're retarded
The dumb, the harder to stun
Phasers on
