[Verse 1: Elucid]
Data madden galactic flows
Shitty crack bundles litter my path back home
Following human drones over familiar smoker's cough
Pipe glass scorch third-degree
Every verse curse the beat, purposefully
That's word to me
Everything begins with intention
Pending addendum to the book of coming forth by day
Lose your life trying to ride this wave
Damn straight, cream rise like tide
I'm taking mines off top
Knowing what it's like to cha-cha slide
When it's time to pay
I'm good at these ghetto games
I'm good at these ghetto games
Brains got blue, coop he's flew
Few states remove
Titty deep in the Gullah swamp with a view
Flora, fauna and bandwidth drop me a line
I eat too much pussy to be a Rasta
Smoke 'em if they got 'em
My first pull was chocolate from a chalice
Many mansions, many mansions
Slanted room of solid ground
Scenic with rocky route
Too sweet, pull a tooth, free screamings
I told poverty, chill on selling babies Hot Takis and blue juice
They weighed me down

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Black crow perched upon chimney pipe
Dark as your worst night
Heroin dealers crane they necks against the absence of light
Curses and stones thrown, but it didn't take flight
I laughed at how they tight
Called on god between moans
But can't shake the feeling she faking, homes
My last meal was my own heart
You'll take the deal, if you smart
Better yet, time's a flat circle
Take the wheel and depart
It's you or them, it ain't no friends
Guns come out with the icey men
Here we go again, again

[Verse 3: Elucid]
I only write for the dead, who sinned of the flesh
Lawfully wed, close range to the chest
Houston, it's Fred
Crane of the neck, take heed it's a pledge
Spitting wheels when greed drove a wedge
Brokered a deal, now move, take the spread
Plasma congeals, more grounded than red
Taste of iron and lead
If you lie you're steel, tough guys don't squeal
Aim for his face, divided what's real
You're a fly in the web, riot for bread
Swipe crumb from the edge
Faithful tithing ten percent
Prophesied, I wouldn't rumba with the reaper
My brother's keeper, a chosen child amongst the people
Arbitrary evils, force leathal
What isn't, isn't legal
Hard to hear the trumpet
I'm a deep sleeper, but I feel like I've been running
It be sudden, it be sluggish the the blood through fatty arteries
Be ye at the ready, I can't hide, this all a part of me
Presidential pardons, on the mama's, keep my body strong
A moving target in the killing fields, cunning skill
Unbroken will, but I be so fucking weary
Whistle past the graveyard running errands
Without warning, courting heaven
Seven is the number, snatched up by the hunter

Speaking to an unframed sky
Hearing there's no why sometimes
Fear behind the eyes don't hide
If we gotta ride let's ride
If we gotta ride let's ride

Speaking to an unframed sky
Hearing there's no why sometimes
Fear behind the eyes don't hide
If we gotta ride let's ride
If we gotta ride let's ride

Speaking to an unframed sky
Hearing there's no why sometimes
Fear behind the eyes don't hide
If we gotta ride let's ride

Rise, rise, rise
