[Verse 1]
You paid the price, you followed orders
Months at a time laying in ambushes by the borders
The blunt cackle of gun battles, last breath death rattles, and air-sucking thump of mortars
Thick flames
Hideous and gorgeous
And when command said find the informants
You followed orders
You visited the camps
You oversaw the torture
You tightened the clamps
You lied to reporters
You ducked the piss
You made sure the confessions were recorded
You still see their faces
Corners of you eyes are morbid
Copper in the air taste it
Flowing like an open faucet
Can't erase it
But you a soldier
You follow orders
Once the war was won
Switch fatigues for corporate
Suits and ties
Still see those eyes clear as portraits
Watching yourself go through the motions
Pretending you're not dead adrift in a black ocean
So imagine the relief when the indictments are finally read
Grey hair on your head
Lean into the mic flanked by lawyers
And finally tell someone
All you did was follow orders

[Chorus]
One time is one time
Cause that's all it takes to change your life
You did have it coming but no worries
The postman always rings twice, thrice
The ghost came past present future
Price on your dome so chunky anyone could be the shooter
Then lay low as you lie down
Uneasy is the head that rocks the crown
One time is one time
Cause that's all it takes to change your life
You did have it coming but no worries
The postman always rings twice

[Verse 2]
It always starts small
Got a little something made it flip
Not about the ball just upgrade the whip
Maybe a little something on the wrist
Your little dun see your new kicks
He see you in the hall smoking sticks
See the ass on your new bitch, poke it
Baby powder between the tits
Keep bugging you, he got the itch
You let him get a taste
Twelve months later he taking the trips
Cause now you shaving bricks cinder blocks masonry bits
Family ties like Cain and Abel
Cutting cocaine on the kitchen table
Ain't want no trouble
But evil got roots
You said no guns but he said he had to shoot
Fire out the cannon
You can't serve God and Mammon
Flying back uptown, interior salmon
Cops got y'all jammed in
You made the wrong move, try to ram them
Boys in blue commence to blammin'
And just like you broke out the game like the old bandits
Commissioners press conference only got room for standing
At the funeral tea pots and liquor
They commence to plotting and planning
Divide up and re up before the first shovel full of dirt landed
Moms distraught but the uncle's like
What the fuck did she think would happen!

[Chorus]
One time is one time
Cause thats all it takes to change your life
You did have it coming but no worries
The postman always rings twice trice
The ghost came past present future
Price on your dome so chunky anyone could be the shooter
Then lay low and you lie down
Uneasy is the head that rocks the crown
One time is one time
Cause thats all it takes to change your life
You did have it coming but no worries
The postman always rings twice trice
The ghost came past present future
Price on your dome so chunky anyone could be the shooter
Then lay low and you lie down
Uneasy is the head that rocks the crown
