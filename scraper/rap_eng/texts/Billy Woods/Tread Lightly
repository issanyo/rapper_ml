[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
Once it came to first question: "Whatcha gon' do with the time you got?"
Confused, they reiterated like gotta remember it's not a lot
It's not a lot
I replied "Just watch" while she administered the eyedrops
Probably redid Illmatic bar for bar, she's gotta have it shot for shot
Motherfuckers waste a lot of time, ock
Words stolen from neighbors in bodegas when I copped my paper
Now you know where I got my flavor
Like I said, it's a lot of time wasted, it's a lot
Sorry, skimmed through your music, found no reason not to approve it
It was all relatively toothless, you're just a guy
Ruthless how they did Ruth first, I let the package sit overnight
Let it open on the desk, how he live is anybody guess
Poe's "Telltale Heart" pigs wait patiently for you negros to confess
No rush, the wind through your shed'll rattle your sheet metal
Pour, the meat pimps peddle
Don't front like you stupid, you on they level
Pressed, passed a while the mortar and pestle, said "presto"
When they found that .38 special

[Verse 2: Elucid]
The wifi name is "Assata is safe here"
The passcode transpose the notated between kick and the snare
For whosoever believe feeling beastie, Paul Revere
It's all gone square, sand shifting, a brief history
Take cover, tread light, I ain't got no type
Love is love, y'all
Knowing better don't mean you doing better
We watch the sky fall
Lit by the moon blush, dip soon come
Blue movies on the tablet like I'm non-respectably ratchet
Rappers politically black halfwit
Pack spliff vegetate halfpipe twilight
Tomorrow's just another yesterday
Several ways to skin a coon
Magnolia bloom with the blood pool
Lord, who can I run to?
Live feed from slum view
Whole crew kick laces knotted [?] NY power violets
What up family? Then it shot
She stopped giving bop, adjusted her top
My alarm clock is black children playing in the park
Every nigga's a star
Crowdfunded constellation burned keloid scar
Oh, he go hard, the young gods bark
The universe is a  cardsharp, my new studio's a smart car
Had a dream I gifted Nardwuar some Carhartt
To spark a heart most toxic, hock spit
Blast my way out, gut full of rock shrimp
With much vigor to the rhythm of bodybag zipper swipes
Never paid the asking price, double down on paradise
