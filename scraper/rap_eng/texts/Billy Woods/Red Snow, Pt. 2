[Verse: billy woods]
Borrowed suit, I pop bottles in hard bottoms
Sip juice from Tiffany coupes
Watching white women raise the roof
Pour something for old friends who always pick the wrong men
Cycling through the same excuses again and again and again
“He's not like this when it's just me and him”
Had to suppress a grin
Classical music no need to go out on a limb
Cognac and gin Stay Up Late with Womack and Friends
On my own damn planet
The little prince
Ignore me
It's yourself you gotta convince because your fiancé is a bitch
Open bar get my crutch dance like crip
They wanted a speech, I let 'er rip
All i heard was "preach brotha!"
On my Big Gipp dabbing forehead monogrammed handkerchief
“This won't take all night”
Sunk cost fallacy
Counting the days till I'm paid to rap in a gallery
Drug war almost over
Nobody wanna be the last casualty
Arresting officer laughing casually like
"Is you mad at me, or yourself?"
Bad situation like you grabbed the belt
Sniveling, legs starting to welt and all mom said was
"Let go, or else"
