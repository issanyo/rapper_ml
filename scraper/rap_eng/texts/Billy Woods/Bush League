[Verse 1]
Walked in scanning the room for human shields
Victory formation, only time he ever kneels
Reeducation camp greeter, name tag says "Bill"
Is this your first time in the killing fields?
We're not trying to reinvent the wheel
You gon' get this work
Look alive like botched drug deal
Team building exercise
Big ice, orange zest, no peel
Old-fashioned how he kept it really real
Losing sponsors, press release says "I'm too ill"
Not responsible for my comments
Face turn heel
Don't let your Happy Meal congeal
Laying there killed
By the cops
You know record sealed before the body dropped
News coverage reset your body clock
Now you know the time lightbulb moment
White supremacy - the worthiest of opponents
Exchanged jerseys and shook hands
"Both teams played hard, my man!"

[Hook x4]
A couple flavors
A couple favors
A cup of coffee in the majors
Today's paper

[Verse 2]
Ten years old, phone calls, heavy breathing
Mom said, "No more lies or I'm leaving"
Rang again, she screamed
He walked out came back that evening
Last time they ever called the house
Apple didn't fall far from the bar
Real butter wouldn't melt in her mouth
Land o' Lakes, one ship, the hand don't shake
Shoebox full of dollars short, day late
Plea cops brought into the wake
Comin' in hot
My wave point break
Under the radar, over the treetops
Cut the cake, ate it too
She spit on it for lube
I'm the smartest dummy in the room, day-dreamin'
Now you fiending like stuff you could cook in a spoon
Running on fumes
Desert island on horizon not a moment too soon
She rode a broom through the gloom
But I was happier marooned
Hidden from the searchlights
Rescue flights
Pack your water pipe
Hemingway shotguns through the nose
Ghost's voice, Rae's flow
The devil you know

[Hook x4]
A couple flavors
A couple favors
A cup of coffee in the majors
Today's paper
