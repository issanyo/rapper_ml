[Verse 1]
Ankle sock, ashy Achilles
Flatfeet knock looking for Billy
My voice switch, Uncle Quilly
Be in the can eating canned chili out the can
Canned laugh as he mash past Philly
Gas mask, how the gas so illy?
Hash got me like they might kill me
Noided, yes but yo they might really
Off the rack suit Hazmat, suitcase full of brass tacks
Job interview might coulda had a laugh track
Must’ve smelled a rat or the Gorilla Glue, cheap shoes
Either way Jack, the position’s nigga-proof
Necklace cobra tooth
Shell casings like bric-a-brac, otherwise place is like new
Winnie the Pooh half nude fingers in the honeypot
Not to be lewd, police sketch crude
River Styx booze cruise lose-lose

[Chorus]
Wrinkled dress shirts at work
Three-quarter length jorts in court
Secondhand suicide vests
Fresh bomb threats locally sourced
Wrinkled dress shirts at work
Three-quarter length jorts in court
Secondhand suicide vests
Fresh bomb threats locally sourced
Wrinkled dress shirts at work
Three-quarter length jorts in court
Secondhand suicide vests
Fresh bomb threats locally sourced
Wrinkled dress shirts at work
Three-quarter length jorts in court
Secondhand suicide vests
Fresh bomb threats locally sourced

[Verse 2]
Guinea-Conakry warehouse full of tall tees
Triple XL Sean John jeans
Shrink-wrapped Diplomats double CDs
Art direction Sudanese
Every penny squeezed, African ebonies
Rich as bone marrow, margins narrow
Draped in Renaissance apparel
Last laughs stashed by the barrel
Last gasp of a Pharaoh
Blot the sun with arrows
Read weed leaves like Tarot
Beat the case, Charles Darrow, fire burn
Babylon brought marshmallow
Ras, your god is dead
Wings are ten feet of lead
Childhood friends foreboding and dread
Hell’s Gate under race car bed
Show and tell, young Will had Medusa’s head
Eyes rimmed red, hard day’s night
False skin shed by full moon's light
Troglodyte cackle while he write, a pipe alight
Spittoon full of spite
Even whites admit he right, riding by on Citibikes
It was all a sight so he could say, "Psych"
A hundred missed calls
I’m onto y’all tryna co-ordinate drone strikes

[Bridge]
