Up on the mountain
I'll be counting
...days 'til we meet again
Get my revenge
We'll never be friends
...i'll keep building up my brain
Just watch your back
For my next attack
...you never know when i'll strike
Could be today
Don't get in my way
...you'll see what you'll never like

I've got the brain
I'm insane
You can't stop the power
See you in pain
Yet again
You won't stop the power

Fight the power!

I'm your creator
And your enslaver
...i can destroy you all
You've got the brainpower
Of a sunflower
...get ready for a fall
I'll find a way
To spoil your day
...i'll stop you from doing good
I'll take you out
It's no use to shout
...i'd break you, you know i would
