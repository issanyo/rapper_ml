[Chorus]
Now and forever (x4)

[Verse 1]
I need a woman that's sexy
Straight up and erotic
I gotta have her
Yes a beautiful sex goddess
The kind of girl who rocks my world
Doin' those crazy things
With whipped cream an' ice cream
An' everything from grapes to honey, And if you ask me
I want her for 9 1/2 weeks money
Straight stranded on a beach "G"
While she climbs up and down
This tall coconut tree
An' doin' wild things with
Her tongue and lips
An' her thighs, includin' them hips
She comes equipped to lead
The I.C.E. stuck, the kind of woman who
Can make my volcano erupt

[Chorus]
Now and Forever (x4)...I gotta have it (x4)

[Verse 2]
I need a woman that drives me crazy
When I look at her
And make the Ice Man melt
When I look at her
Yeah, she's the one to make Vanilla's blood boil
Open up that hood
And let me check that oil
I got the right dip stick for the job honey
Watch me swing, while you're dancin' in your G-string
And let me pull up to your bumpa
And if your battery is dead
I'll pull my cable out and jump ya'
Pump ya' with the juice
To keep the engine runnin'
Oh yes, you've got the body work
To keep the Ice man comin'
Again and again
In any type of weather, Baby
I need you - Now, Now and Forever

[Chorus]
Now and Forever (x4)...I gotta have it (x4)

[Verse 3]
I'm the type of man that
Likes to get it off
I'll pour some champagne all
Over your body, and then I'll lick it off
Uh an' I have to tell you somthin'
I want to kiss your neck
And take my tongue around your belly button
I need a woman not a hooka
To take rides on my love boat
Yes, my 53 footer
So let's sink in my hot tub or jacuzzi
And do those crazy wild things
That amuse me
Oh yes baby, I'll be your sex slave
And with my head gear on
I wanna go and explore your cave
See you can make the Ice cream
Come here girl, and take a lick of this ice cream

[Chorus]
Now and Forever (x4)..I gotta have it (x4)
