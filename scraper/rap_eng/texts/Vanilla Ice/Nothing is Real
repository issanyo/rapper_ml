[Verse 1]
Death and destruction, weak rhymes and hard crimes
Thin lines and lost time to find mine
Lost nights of raw fights and white lies
Dark skies with no signs of any light
Genocide what lies inside the eyes
I'm terrorized despite the pains and cries
I won't run, you know I won't hide
Why? It's fight night world wide
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming!

[Hook]
Nothing is real, can't touch, can't feel
Nothing is right, can't save my life!

[Verse 2]
Stay wise and rise to the other side
Free the mind and unify, let's redefine
Love and hate, don't complicate
When we all die
Don't intensify the struggles that I have inside
Solidify the reason why, people ask why?
Can't see the light they blow it out each and every time
Clear the path feel the wrath
Now I'm free
Get from in front of me!

He's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming

[Hook]

You can't make me die, now I testify, through you I can see
Get from in front of me

You can't make me die, now I testify, through you I can see
Get from in front of me, now!

[Hook]
