[Verse 1]
Here it is, A dope hit
Iceman's comin' with the dope shit
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit
Jealous cause I went multi-platinum
Now I'm gonna blast them in the head
Till they're dead with my magnum
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no gimp
On the strength cause I know how to pimp it
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinkin' in my quicksand
Vanilla ice vocal hit man
Got the number 3 in my crosses sittin' on the rooftoop
[Gunshot sounds], And the fools drop
Pop goes the weasel was a big fa-flop-flop
The brothers didn't like your record
Cause it wasn't hip-hop hop
But this ain't a dis, Cause you sold gold
Still I made a killin'
Cause it ain't even a tenth of eleven million
Givin' my rhyme spice, while my dj's on the slice
Vanilla ice is back on the map, with the wrath of
The Iceman

[Hook]
Ice, ice, man
The wrath of the Ice man

[Verse 2]
I'm the ice, The iceman but I'm no superhero
So baby just cut that zero
I'm gettin' tired of those punks gettin' jealous
Trying to say that I might be another Elvis
Forget that cause I'm vanilla, the funky rhyme killa
The dope song deala, ready to peel a cap of a wack MC
There's no wack in me, and big dollars is all I'm stackin', G
So give a boost to the volume
I got the funky-funky sounds to make the cars boom
So step back and give me room, As I consume the others
The iceman is bringin' doom to the suckers
Yes, for the lovers of hip-hop
And for my foes they get popped
You shouldn't step to the man
When I'm swingin' like Tyson
Yo, punk this is the wrath of the Iceman

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm on everybody's hitlist, so trip this
So they're gonna get dissed, now they're on my hitlist
It's like that cause I'm the mizzak I carry my strizap
To bust a kizzap, don't try to jizzak me
Cuz my life is like hectic, when I made a record
Now I'm gettin hounded every second
See I'm like the one they love to hate
So I made this album much harder to set the stupid critics straight
And I'm still droppin' bombs [Bomb sounds]
You know the rap world's a battle field in vietnam
And I'm creepin' like a sniper
Takin' out the suckers with an album that is funkier and hyper
The type of street stuff I like listenin' to
Funky bass and breaks to make your Speakers shake
Earthquake breaks the Richter scale
Check out the aftermath, yo, this the wrath of
The Iceman

[Hook]
