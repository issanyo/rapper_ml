[Chorus]

Wasn't too long ago when I got the dream
Shit went down behind the scenes
All just one day before Valentines 2017
Thought I was going crazy
Been a better me lately
Broke all the roles people motherfucking gave me
My whole motherfucking world's re-aranging
I'm facing the bases of bullshit

[Verse 1]

Seems like the whole fucking world hates me
But I don't hate myself no more
And I'm learning to love
Never loving a whore
They think I'm playing games like connect four
Well you can connect the dots
Never on a ponzi scheme
Opened up my eyes to pyramid schemes
With illuminati things
Don't know about all that
But I know about this
The system ain't right
The whole world seems fucked up
Lost sight of the future
Bleeding out, need a suture
There wasn't a light at the end of my tunnel
Took off my fucking ceiling
Doin' something better than I ever once did
But when my words start to fumble
Not feeling my own feelings
Feeling like all those that hate me
Hate themselves, they don't kid
What?
Just hoping they don't hate themselves as much

[Chorus]

Wasn't too long ago when I got the dream
Shit went down behind the scenes
All just one day before Valentines 2017
Thought I was going crazy
Been a better me lately
Broke all the roles people motherfucking gave me
My whole motherfucking world's re-aranging
Facing the bases of bullshit

[Verse 2]

Shout out to the great big world
No pearls, gotta got nuts like a squirrel
If you wanna make it
Ya better fucking fake it
Let's face it
People don't want the truth
They want the drama
They want trendy topics
Something brain numbing
No fumbling
I keep it coming
Keep on running
Few miles to go
Till I leave this world
Ride a fucking rocket ship
Just to see that time can skip
Just to know that I'm not fit
So I write what's writ
Even when I lean left
Just know I mean right
They told me put up a fight
Shocked em like it's thunder
We all got the hunger
Top charts just a number
When everyone goes running
Mockingbird never bumbling
But fuck your next bro
Waiting for my next flow
Keep on droppin bombs
No korea, I'm talking lyrical napalms

[Chorus]

Wasn't too long ago when I got the dream
Shit went down behind the scenes
All just one day before Valentines 2017
Thought I was going crazy
Been a better me lately
Broke all the roles people motherfucking gave me
My whole motherfucking world's re-aranging
I'm facing the bases of bullshit

[Verse 3]

Everyday we wake up to fake fucks
Fake bucks
Fake busts
Everything seems fake now
Not me
Not really
On a mission
No religion
Politicking
Never missing
In action
Fuck redacting
Say what you mean
And mean what you say
Hey
If we do that
We'll all be okay
When we need the fucking raise
Work your fucking ass off
Say fuck spring break
Writting raps
Missiles locked no caps
But a fast rap
Changes the way we are percieving
Information
No more hesition
Not know creation
A faceless system
Created to keep us in check
Fuck that
Black paisleys what I rep
Bunch a nobodies
Never heard nothing yet
When the eyes what I praise
Better catch their fucking eyes
Old me is dead
Two tone survived

[Chorus]

Wasn't too long ago when I got the dream
Shit went down behind the scenes
All just one day before valentines 2017
Thought I was going crazy
Been a better me lately
Broke all the roles people motherfucking gave me
My whole motherfucking world's re-aranging
I'm facing the bases of bullshit
