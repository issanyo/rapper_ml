Intro:
Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, Ive found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker (right on, right on, right on)
Who is it?
Well its grand puba honey
With my man snug doogie love
Droppin 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it

Verse 1:
I hit a flow all dipped in lotion
Sit back and sip moe as Im countin my doe
Grand puba macks well, doogie, comin with the new york
We keep it real like jail when we might talk
Honies know cause when Im in the set
Grand puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin lady
When ya flow this flow then its all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie
And dance body to body
Step one: first you grab honey by the waist
Step two: then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three: then ya look her dead in the face
Step four: now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesas
The teasas, the one who wants the money and the visas
Ima tell honies straight off the bat
But please dont even go there with that, dig it
This ones designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand puba lights it up for you every time

Chorus:
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say new york city (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya and ya say new york city (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say new york city (I like it)
Ooooh yeah I lke it
And ya say (I like it)

Verse 2:
Could it be Ive stayed away too long
Seems mcs be wishing I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
Its only one grand p, so honey do what you did on the night you creeped with
Me
Its no doubt I come real with that
The butter track
The one that makes the honeis hit the bed mat
Im energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like Im simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
Im still wicked in a bed because Im down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe, cause when it comes to gettin down
Im gettin looser than a crackheads hair weave
And i, bet ya my dolly, while ya never find another style like this
If ya search a million miles
So whyn cha let puba ingnite your party
I hit a flow liike al jarrow
But Ive been doin this for years
Im leavin mcs in tears, tears; dig it
Cause they fallin just like the rain
Grand pubas too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left em backwardds, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause pubas everything, and everything is pu
Cause I hitem with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause thats just how grand pu and sadat doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb baby
Somebody shouldve told you, somebody should have told you

Chorus:
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
And ya say new york city
Ooooh, yeah I like it (no doubt)
And ya say new york city
Ooooh, yeah I like it
Ha ha, and ya say
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Ninety-five flav, and Im out
