Now raise your drinks at the bar, Butts and bras
House speakers coming out your sneakers
Come on and release the juice. And let it all
Hang out like prostitutes. For those that don't
Know, I'm back up in ya grill. Set it off, can I do
Another spill, I make the speakers go boom in
Your ear. Write a rhyme, put it together like
Shakespeare. Drop it in the streets, you bump it
In your Jeeps. We make it phat enough, Now
Everybody get your drinks up Get your drinks
Up Get your drinks up Get your drinks Get your
Drinks Get your drinks up

Put your head in the air
Bounce like you really don't care
Bounce Bounce
I could take you there
Bounce Bounce
Are you scared? Tell me, are you scared?

Baby, put your head in the air
Bounce like you really don't care
Bounce Bounce
I could take you there
Bounce Bounce
Are you scared? Tell me, are you scared?

Cause I get crazy, party with your friends all
Night. In the club feeling love, everything's all
Right. Now Come on along and just ride this
Song. To the proper cuttin rhythm. Dj cuttin it
Raw, To the break dawn, Got it going on, Keep
You hot in the shade, While I go in a rage, I got
Pounds and pounds of this so go on down to
This, I ain't net to this, Woo, dope I'm sellin ya
Keepin' you coming back, Capable of cutting up
The party like a lumberjack, Thought I wasn't
Capable but yet I get the flava bro, Back to the
Lab, grab the pen and pad. Yeah, droppin' science
That you thought I never had, And if you came
Here to party like you don't give a Fuck. Put your
Drinks up, Put your drinks up, Wooha, Wooha
