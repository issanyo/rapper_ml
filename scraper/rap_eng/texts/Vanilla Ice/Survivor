[Intro]
I'm a survivor
I've been around the block
I'm a survivor
I've been around the block
I'm a survivor

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Well, it's not about the industry
And it's not about the things
I've been through like Nas or Jay-Z
See I've seen a lot of things on the road to destruction
Addicted to this rap game standin up and bustin
This ain't a come back
This ain't a second comin
We took a real loss when Dimebag stopped strummin
America's in trouble and music is dying
They said some things about me
Now the rap game is lying

[Hook]
I'm a survivor
I've been around the block
I'm a survivor
I'm coming out of the block
I'm a survivor
And yet you know I won't stop
I'm a survivor
I got this game on lock
I'm a survivor
What you got
What you got
I'm a survivor
What you got
What you got
I'm  a survivor
You don't want it
You don't want it
You don't want it
I'm a survivor
You don't want it
You don't want it

[Verse 2]
From sold out stages
To seconds from my life
To rollin with Madonna
To reckin on my bike
There's some things I regret
And some I don't
Some things I take back
Some I won't
I went from style of the 90s to Dickies and Shell Toes
No matter what I'm wearing
I'm still in the hell hole
Escape suicide from that gun on my dresser
I look into my daughters eyes
That releives pressure

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
First they love you
Then they hate you
Then sign you
Then they break you
Treat you like a sport
Pump fake you
Then they shake you
And I don't want your pity
Cause I'm far from the norm
I can take what you give
I've done made through the storm
I want the whole world to know me
Straight through my songs
Baby when I die
Let the songs live on
Cause I'm Survivin
And you know I won't stop
I'm Survivin
I'm coming out of the box

[Hook]
