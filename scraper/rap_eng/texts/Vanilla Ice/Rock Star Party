[Intro]
Yeah, we in Vegas baby
Uh, where the party at
It's in the hotel, in the hotel
Rock star party in the hotel

[Verse 1: Vanilla Ice]
Blazing facts back equipped with six gears
Fresh off the year my house is three tiers
Eastwood the track, DJ be bumpin' fear
Well, I'm a man ain't no need for you to steer
And when I got it I can see it real clear
I'm loungin' on the pier with a case of cold beer
A few making goods and a spear's here
All dressed in cheers and my slippers Kashmir

[Chorus]
We in Vegas, Vegas
Rock star party in Vegas
Uh, get crunk with it, get crunk with it
Get crunk with it
I'm in Vegas, rock star party in Vegas

[Verse 2: Vanilla Ice]
That's the sound of the ninjas party
This is my year, now get that to your ear
Yeah I'm right here, I put an engineer
A front line soldier but you came into the rear
My stylo avocado where my tunas can sear
Hear my mack groupies yo my name they try to smear
I appear gangsta mode and they disappear
I'm holding grey near and everything I spit
Guaranteed world premier

[Chorus]
We in Vegas, Vegas
Rock star party in Vegas
Uh, get crunk with it, get crunk with it
Get crunk with it
I'm in Vegas, rock star party in Vegas

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, if you party like a rock star
Get your hands up, let me know who you are
Uh, let's shine like a star
Yeah, we in Vegas, get your shine on

[Chorus]
We in Vegas, Vegas
Rock star party in Vegas
Uh, get crunk with it, get crunk with it
Get crunk with it
I'm in Vegas, rock star party in Vegas
Only in Vegas baby
