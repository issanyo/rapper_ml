[Verse 1]
All I see is hate, can't understand why?
And now it's like the whole wide world's got me hypnotized
On a hex for generation X
What's next, the mutated breeding of Tyranosaurus Rex
Through DNA testing, I really don't condone
The right to clone, why don't you leave it alone?
Smoke some homegrown, get up in this zone
Amplify your mind while you're puffing on a bone
One hit then I see right through the bullshit
Media blitz, got people loading their clips
Spreading the hate, now you're sealing your fate
Take a look up in the mirror and face what you create

[Hook]
All I see is hate, (Fuck you what you want to do huh?)
All I see is hate, (Fuck me, well fuck you too)
All I see is hate, (psycho-fanatic, your mind is an addict)
All I see is hate, (Don't give a fuck, why cause I've had it)

[Verse 2]
Black Sunday, on the day I hate breed
Jesus paid and now we're all gonna bleed
Dirty deeds and their done dirt cheap
Now they creep through the streets
While you weep in your sleep
From Miami to LA, New York and back
It's like a pimp slap, from a bum on crack
And then you you got jacked like Lindros on his back
In fact, you lack, your intelligence is wack
Stop the hate, it ain't too late
The devil'll take your soul unless you step up to the plate
Spreading the hate, now you're sealing your fate
Take a look up in the mirror and face what you create

[Hook repeat]

My path lies beneath your eyes
My path lies beneath your eyes
My path lies beneath your eyes
My path lies beneath your eyes

[Hook repeat]
