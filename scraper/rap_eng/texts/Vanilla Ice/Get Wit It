[Verse 1]
Disaster, systems break when I quake
Make no mistake, the crowd stays awake
When I'm Shakin' and bakin' and I'm takin' all mc's
Smilin' on the mic cause I'm gonna make big g's
Pow! holy cow! it's like a bang or a boom
Mc's see me comin' and they're clearin' the room
Ouuta my path cause they're scared of the result
Don't wanna battle cause to me that's an insult
Man, I wouldn't even lower myself
I got your record and put it on the shelf
I didn't play it, I used it as a frisbee
Your girl saw me doin' it and she kissed me
A good sport cause the ball's in my court
And in the long run I'm takin' no shorts
Slayin' competition till the parties done
You want a non stop jam
Here's the right one

[Hook]
Gotta get it going' on
Get wit' it
Bust that beat

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm blessed and I must confess
Put me to the test and you'll say I'm the best
I don't joke, I don't even jest
Every line in my rhyme makes me better than the rest
I'll live high on the hog, on the fat of the land
Goddamn, I'll be so hot I'll have to walk with a fan
On the brink of success, champagne & caviar
In limo's, just like a superstar
Business, Leave your number at my office
Not for sale, But the fans all bought this
Money pourin' in, Just like it was a faucet left on
Cause my rhymes are that strong, Last long
Just like a coppertop battery
You think I'm dope, Come on, Don't flatter me
Cause I been hearin' that stuff for years
Respect from my peers and I'm changin' the gears
Of that hip-hop engine, not to mention
Retire at 21 and get a pension
Gonna bust it out and your welcome to come
You wanna non stop jam here's the right one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Here's another rhyme to break the ice
You couldn't purschase my talent at any price
Don't chase a roni cause I know that I can get 'em
I'm not the type so I don't even sweat 'em
I'll love a girl and then dis the same one
Cause you know that there's more
Where that came from
Yo, the one I want just walked through the threshold
So all you other girls are out in the cold for now
She's the only one for me
Who knows if we were meant to be
Together forever and that's a real long time
And you can tell I'm in the house by my dope rhyme
Man, I'm glad she came to her senses
And that she put down all her defenses
And finally gave her heart & soul
To the man behind the mic control
I'm here with her now I'm ready for fun
You want a non stop jam, here's the right one

[Hook]
