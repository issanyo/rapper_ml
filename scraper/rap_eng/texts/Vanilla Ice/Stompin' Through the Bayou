Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy
Keepin it holy means no snatching purses on sunday
I got what you want and everything you need
Come and follow me thru this society
Hear me holler and scream until your ears bleed
See me comin at you I know you fear me
STOMP! STOMP!
Stompin thru the bayou [x4]
Fuck all the bullshit I don't give a fuck
[?]
I can see your scemes you false prophets
Fuck the American dream my shit is toxic
I spit more venom than you leave you in boxes
Stompin thru the bayou no one can stop this
STOMP! STOMP!
Stompin thru the bayou [x4]
Do it how I do it
Flowin like fluid
Blew up the nine deuce and I'm still true to it
Are you stupid
And I mean thought they could stop me
Enemy is sloppy
So I came back like Rocky Balboa
I'll show you how it really goes down
Takin 12 rounds
Turn it into a Ghost Town
Hell bound
Here comes a hell hound for your heart
I rip you apart don't get caught after dark
Cause I...
STOMP! STOMP!
With my big black boots on! [x2]
STOMP! STOMP!
Stompin thru the Bayou
STOMP! STOMP!
I got what you want and every thing you need
Come and follow me thru this society
Hear me holler and scream until your ears bleed
See me stompin at you I know you fear me [x2]
STOMP! STOMP!
Stompin thru the Bayou [x4]
