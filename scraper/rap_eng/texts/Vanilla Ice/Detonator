[Hook - repeat 2X]
Lettin loose its the detonator setting off a time bomb
Ring the alarm
I'm coming through with the wickedness
Inject the fluids of the sickest and watch as I kick this

[Verse 1]
I got a nation of millions to capture
Lyrical disaster pass the Ganja
Choppin shit like a bladerunner
Huntin down my opponents like the predator
Ready to start my search like the hunt for Red October 31st
Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent
Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin
They're on my trail like the bone collector
Select the sense from my sixth
Inject the fluid of the wickedness
Fuck the world! Is my motto
I just can't understand why they point the finger
When they see me doing my thing
Bitches swing when they see me pass on by
In the GS4
With the Cane plates bought from my last tour
Its Amityville Horror on haters block
For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top
Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness
I'm true to kicking this

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 2]
Like Manson dismantling MC's who oppose a threat
You really don't want to get into some shit that you'll regret
Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation
Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith
Is it safe to come out and play now? Is he gone?
Man I don't understand what kind of high this dude is trippin on
Pure I-C-E with a twist of Vanilla thriller
Captivating souls like the body snatchers
Its return of the living Caucasians
Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics
Causing havoc bringing the pain
Flaming up like in Backdraft
Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion
Many aren't true to what they're busting
(From the depths)
I'm coming through like the Hell Raiser
It's the end of days there's no escape from the detonator
