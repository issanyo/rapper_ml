[Intro]
Yo, Vanilla. Kick it one time, boy!
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'till you die

[Verse 1]
Check it out, cause Ice is rhyming
To the top I keep on climbing
Suckas thought I couldn't swing this
Now rock the crowd and get a pump-fist
Go, Ice, everybody is sayin'
To the funky beat that's playin'
If you wanna stop me you can't hang
Vanilla is in this with a shotgun bang
Extreme is where I'm taking it
One week MCs just keep on faking it
Smooth, like Strawberry ice cream
Flow with the beat real smooth and nicely
Ladies, I wanna' rock with you
And Later in the night, you know I'd like to pursue
Something real sexy and nice
Play that funky music, Vanilla Ice!

[Chorus]
Play that funky music
Play that funky music right (Pump it up!)
Play that funky music right (I can't hear you!)
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'till you die

[Verse 2]
Some people thought I wouldn't break
Then I stuffed number one in their face
Never, forget where I came from
Don't lose your head (heh) cause you can get dumb
Do it, is my motto for the moment
Get in my way, I'll knock you out like my opponent
Cause' in this life it's one for all
All for one and a loud no downfall
Punks, always wanna' get some
Pick-Pockets and then they try to play dumb
Yo, take it From the Ice man
Lyrical Poet with a master plan
Telling you how it is in showbiz
A white rapper with some street knowledge
I write the rhyme for you (Yeeeah)
Drop this one for the V.I.P. Crew

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Your wreakin' vast (No!) And I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot (So?) So I can smell it
So don't be mad, and don't be sad
Cause your lyrics brought the Ice(sss)
You can call me Dad
Your pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Witch doctor Ice(sss) will do the dance to cure
Come up close, uh, and don't be square
You wanna' battle me? Anytime, Anywhere
You thought that I was weak
Boy, your dead wrong
Come on everybody, let's sing this song
Say, Play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Say, Go, white boy, Go, white boy, Go
(Go, white boy, Go, white boy, Go)
Just lay down and boogie, and play that funky music till' you die

[Chorus]

Pump it Up!
What's my DJ's name?
That's right baby
BOOM!
