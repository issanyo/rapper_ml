[Hook: Vanilla Ice]
Tell my why we all live and die
Why some people try suicide
Why do children have to fight for their lives
Tell my why
Tell my why
Why do priests molest a child
Why does war have to be so wild
Why do all politicians lie
Tell my why tell my why

[Verse 1: Vanilla Ice]
Well its a mad mad world that we're living in today
Hypnotize people remember Heaven's Gate
Marshal Applewhite with the mass suicide
Thinking the Hale-Bopp will take them to the afterlife
Well that's fucked up just like 9-11
Mohammed Atta didn't even have a gun
Seventy-two virgin wives going through his brain
Killed 5,000 Americans, healed the pain
Brainwashed by Osama Bin Laden
Terrorized the world, shit will never be forgotten
Like Jack the ripper back in day
Killing innocent people sending them straight to their graves
How about Jeffery Dahmer and Ted Bundy too
Three serial killers out there, to name a few
What the fuck is our future really going to be
Will we see world peace or will we see catastrophe

[Hook: Vanilla Ice]

[Verse 2: Gemini]
I don't know but sometime I feel I don't know
Exactly how this world's goin to go
I'm Watching my TV screen
And I can't believe what I'm seeing half the time
Politicians lying with their big fake smiles in
Children dying leaving momma's crying
And molestations involving clergymen
What the fuck is happenin
I'm kinda glad that I'm not a father
I'm a kill a mother fucker if they touch my son or my daughter
If I have a seed they supposed to bury me
Not me bury them but that's not how it always how it is Uh-uh
I think twice now about having a child
And bringing 'em into a world that's chaotically wild
Oh I ask why it got be this way but no one answers
And I ain't got none so the problems remain
So I say

[Hook: Vanilla Ice]

[Verse 3: Zeno)
Death becomes us
We came from dust
I can't let the ways of the world come and run us
Like drugs and women
What's the reason for sinning
I was promised eternal life from the beginning
But look at Bush and his brother
Look at Clinton and lover
Kids on the street living foul without they mother
He wasn't gay
He went to pray
He got touched by the priest
John Lennon said that's when he was yelling for peace
Halloween life full of tricks and treats
I put the world on my shoulders
Now they beggin' for peace
It can all be gone in a New York second
Perfect example
September 11th
It's a church cover-up
They hold me in water
Learn to respect a women when I had my daughter
They're your idol
Your highest title
Like Kurt Cobain
Kids mix the black tar with the cocaine
Drinking liquor to ease the pain
Like blood stains on the shirt
Shit I hope I remain
Tell my why
