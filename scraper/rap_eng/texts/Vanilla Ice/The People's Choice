[Verse 1]
It's not what you say, It's how you say it
Give me a microphone, On stage, I'll display it
Playing me right and you'll get played out
Like polka dots and people will shout
Dirty words cause you're a nerd
I'm first, you're third
It's absurd to think that you heard
Better rhymes than these
I'm bringing sucker mc's, down to their knees
Tease your thoughts like a feather to a toe
Although the beat seems slow
My groove will still flow
My rhymes are soulful art
That makes your heart dance
Melodic tones move your mind to a quick trance
Everytime I rhyme I find the audience is
Mine, caught by every line
Sparkle like a gem with my golden voice

Posse: "Why do they love you man?"

I'm the people's choice

[Chorus]
I wanna thank you for lettin' me
Be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Thank you baby
I wanna thank you for lettin' me
Be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Thank you baby
Let's swing it

[Verse 2]
Step aside or you'll get stepped on
Cause I'm steppin' real hard an my rhymes
Are real strong
Just like atilla, An mc killer
A crowd thriller, No once chiller than the man
With the mic in his hand, I'm a trip
All the girls on my tip
Fellas are jealous so I put in the clip
Of my 9-millimeter, Glock at my hip
Fifteen shells all over the place
They would chase, If it wouldn't disgrace
The date that they came with
Cause that would be a dis
Tsk, Tsk, They don't know what they missed
A chance to dance with the man with
The golden voice

Posse: "why do they love you, man?"

I'm the people's choice

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Sucker mc's - I scare 'em
Girlies - I gotta love 'em
Rhymes - Comin' out of my ears
The competition - In tears
Slick dance moves - By the dozens
Battles - Please step up 'cause I love 'em
Settin' up suckers like pins on a bowling ball
And you're gonna fall
You won't hit, It's a bottomless pit
Of rhymes, Comin' straight from the mind
Of a genius, And I can't be modest
When I make a threat, You bet I keep it
Like a promise, So
Shake like a leaf when you see me comin'
Frankly, You're better off runnin', Fast
And don't look back, Wack
Go take a nap, get off that crack, Jack
Crowds move by the sound of my golden voice

Posse: "Why do they love you, man?"

I'm the people's choice

Chorus
