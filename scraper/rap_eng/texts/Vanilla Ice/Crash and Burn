Phone Message from Ross Robinson
"Hey dude it's Ross
Just callin to say hey
Im much better now
I fractured my spine
It was f**ked up
I did a triple over a double
And landed on my head
So um...I did it on the 426
Yep...wasn't to fun
But before that dude I was f**kin totally in tune
And feelin kick ass on the track
It was liek the best I've ever felt
So maybe thats why I started gettin all cocky and shit
Uhh...Alright man, just workin away super hardcore on Slipknot
And I'm about 5 days left and take like a week off
Or somethin like that and start the next one
Hope your doin good dude
Talk to ya later"
