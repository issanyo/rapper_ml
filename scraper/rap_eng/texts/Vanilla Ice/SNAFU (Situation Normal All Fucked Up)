[Verse 1]
Now, the industry has got me thinking twice
Thinking with the treble mix, gotta shake em like dice
Let the whole world know I can't go for that
Girls know that I got gold and stacks
In every cul de sac from the streets to the clubs
I'm making hits and everybody's showing love
Fact is I'm back and I'm rolling like jackson
Won't stop until I'm back at multi platinum
So I start with some action, I'm the main attraction
Here to lie down to the west crackin
Stackin big chips, holmes, gotta get em
Hauling in lots of residuals, what you got
You can't choose me
Bring it to you live for the year 2g

[Hook]
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I'm going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - you never ever made me
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I'm going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - I'm all fucked up

[Verse 2]
Yo, ice it's jim splice me in - no, stop
Begin, pause, cause I gotta call the next of kin
Tell em where you been, tell em that you're ok
Doa, here say, no way, won't say
Dead yes, dead all, not dead and gone
Like a multi-leader, a little bit withdrawn
Time and go like a vicious cycle
Then wham, make em think that you are coming out like george michael
On par to make people to turn in no sooner
Hook, line, and sinker; like charlie the tuna
Drop the hero and get with the zero
I'll try to keep it clean like mr. belvedere
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck the single
Don't want to take it in the can, you're not pringles
But once you pop you can't stop
So don't interrupt - situation normal all fucked up

[Hook 2x]

Round and round we go, where it stops nobody knows
Round and round we go, where it stops nobody knows
