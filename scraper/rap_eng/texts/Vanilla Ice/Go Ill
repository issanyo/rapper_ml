[Verse 1]
Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity
I wanna' make sure all's hearing me
Ducks who's bumming, I found your hide away
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way
Who rocks the crowd and rocks it loud
On the street, y'all, I'm taking bows now
Kicking up lyrics that others want to rock to
Rock like me, y'all, this you can't do
The v, the a, the n, the i, the illa y'all
It's vanilla

[Hook]

Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up

[Verse 2]

Hold on girl, let your feet move free
Cause you move to the groove of vanilla I-C-E
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap
If you're a ho, get off my lap
Cause ice stands for being so cold
That's a nickname I got for being so bold
Jerome stands for M.P.A
My personal assistant, every day
I'm not an MC who come here to play
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm going all the way
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic
When I see one, I got to have it
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum
What you going to do? don't you play dumb
Busy like Kizzy, keep groovin' like Rubin
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'
Shaking your limbs until they wear thin
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin
Simple like Simon, with ice rhymin'
Some MC's faking it, but I'm the diamond
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call
You watch your fries, boy, or I'mma take yours

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

Start freaking and move that hip girl
Get in the mood and don't you quit
Smooth as slime, king rhyme
Rock it boy, cause it's a crime
I'll make you scream like you're in between
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king
Cause I'm hungry as a dog, I'll eat up
My rhymes are running, don't interrupt
I'm a throne overtaker, not an MC faker
I like my coffee, but I can't stand Sanka

[Hook]
