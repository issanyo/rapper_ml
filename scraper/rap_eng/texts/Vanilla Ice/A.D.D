Thru-out my dream these hands are tied
You wear your mask, but I see inside
Never a vision I haven't seen
All these lies spurred from dreams
All these lies left me blind
Whether yours? is all in time
With these hands built this life
Hands of mine now I'm alive
Just can't hide from my self (x2)
I just can't hide from my self
Just can't hide from my fuckin self
I can't hide (x2)
And I can't hide (x2)
Cause I just can't be myself
Cause I just can't fuckin be myself
And I just can't hide from myself
Everytime it's just myself
I can't hide from my fuckin self
I wanna peel my skin hang it on the shelf
Die from no pain
A minimal brain
Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane
Too impulsive too impatient
Anxiety's got me screamin this hatred
Still I strive to stay alive
Gotta get mine cause I just can't be myself
Cause I just can't fuckin be myself
And I just can't hide from myself
Everytime it's just myself
Is there some future? contemplate
I need gratification before it's too late
The cravings are dry, drive me thru
Self destruction can always be true
Islands of fire keep me alive
No drugs around can fill me inside
I can't hide
And I can't hide
I know I can't hide
And I can't hide
I just can't be myself
And I just can't fuckin be my self
I just can't hide from myself
Everytime it's just my self
