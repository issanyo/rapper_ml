[Verse 1]
Now get your drinks, drinks at the bar
Uh, let me know who you are
Shake your ass, 'fros Butts and bras
House speakers dropping, coming out your sneakers
Come on and release the juice and let it all
Hang out like prostitutes, those that don't know
I'm back up in ya grill
Set it off, can I do another spill
Hey hey, hey hey what
I make the speakers go boom in your ear
Write a rhyme, put it together like Shakespeare
Drop it in the streets, you bump it in your Jeeps
We make it phat enough, Now get your hands up

[Pre-Hook]
Hah, get 'em up now
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
Hey [x8]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get crazy, party with your friends all night
In the club feeling love, everything's all right
Break the dawn
Got it going on
Keep you hot in the shade
Go in a rage
I got pounds and pounds of this to get on down to this
I ain't new to this, I'm sellin ya
Keepin' you coming back
Capable of cutting up the party like a lumberjack

[Pre-Hook]
What, Whoop Whoop [x3]
