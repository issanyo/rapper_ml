Man, it's like...
Everytime I leave the house
I stop and I ask myself
Am I leavin' for the last time??
Cause ain't no tellin' what's gon' happen
Out here while I'm runnin' these streets
You know what I'm sayin'?
Anything can happen nigga
You gotta watch everything around you
You can't trust nothin' out here

Another day I get to live to see some more of this
Drama in the street is so deep, don't even know if it's
Gon' be me at the end of somebody barrel smokin'
Cause I'm loc'n they point the finger and say I'm provokin'
The situation by speakin' the real to killin' fields
And penitentiary steel is what I see for real
It's raw deals that we gettin' in the system mayne
Givin' up no love, once you caught up they pullin' rank
County or the pen, you know we can't win
So we mobs with that ghetto grin tryin' to make them ends
Stack on the track with sticky greens and cognac
Always watch your back and never let 'em know you strapped
Ain't no such thing as a sucka no more
Cause anybody with some heat will lay you down on the floor
Friends turn to foes, tags on they toes
When will it be your time to go? You never know

Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know

Used to be the enemy dumpin' on my bucket
Now I'm havin' static with these fools that I grew up with
Never thought the hood would turn against the hood
When they think you doin' good the hood don't stick together like it should
Wastin' time tryin' to count another players chips
Loose lips will make you walk the plank on my ship
I've seen 'em get smothered for less, lost in the land of stress
It's sad to see homies get put to rest, then I guess
It's the same when you funkin' and freeze one of your enemies
Another funeral, a mother cryin' on her knees
It's a war zone, here today tomorrow you gone
In to win, ain't no friends, go for somethin' it's on
Can't get caught slippin' or crossed up by them faulty
Women out there slippin' mickeys ain't gon' come up off me
Who can I trust, who gon' be there when we kickin' dust?
Or when they bust, I'll ride with who ride with us

Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door

Gotta stay on your toes, don't know who plottin' on your click
And jealousy will make your closest homies wanna split
Your wig and dig a ditch for you cause you out there gettin' paid
Had the same trey, posted on the same block in May
Scrill they can't fade, you was real about chasin' paper
They was talkin' about them broads first and get the money later
A faulty misses, stay focused and make your own decisions
Stay in your jurisdiction, keep that scrill in your vision
Watch your backside, they ride when they ain't got no hustle
And keep your heat so fools like Debo can't even muscle
You out your coins and don't let no new recruits join
And she can holla if she headed for the tenderloin
Then strip to add some Ben Franklin's to my bundle
I ain't mad if she gon' add some crab to the gumbo
And keep it crackin', don't know what's gon' happen when I play this game
So I pray, I live to see another day
