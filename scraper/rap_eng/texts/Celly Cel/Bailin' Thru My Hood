[Intro: B-Legit & Celly Cel]
B-Legit: Cel, whassup nigga?
Celly Cel: Whassup man?
B-Legit: I don't know man, what happened with that shit last night man?
Celly Cel: I don't know man, some old bullshit, man. Went down a little something like this though, check it out

[Verse 1: Celly Cel]
Woke up around one, hunged over from last night
Eye kinda swollen 'cause I got into a fight
I woulda pulled my choppa, but this fool was a coppa
I had to dig in the punk ass, prejudice pig
Billy clubbed me in the eye, I had to get witty
Bobbed and weaved, and this nigga never saw me hit him
I was up out of there
Sideways to the liquor sto', already pervin' but I needed mo'
Hit the track where my niggas be posted
Gettin' toasted, told about the pig I roasted
They was puffin' on kill, while I hit my bottle
Gettin' tacced out, strapped with my fully auto-
Matic for the static that the suckers bring
With so much heat, I make the fat lady momma sing
So bring the bell, round one is on
Nuthin' left but a corner in my bottle, now I'm in the zone
Let's run through the town and see what's goin' on
I got a page nigga, take me to the nearest phone
It might be hookup for the whole crew
Rollin' fo' deep and this bitch got partners too
Told her to get down, hooked up somethin' proper fo' her
And when you're pervin', that's the best way to get to know her
The fuck was on and it was all good
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood

[Chorus: Celly Cel]
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood

[Verse 2: Celly Cel]
Spent the night, but we hit the do' early
Drop a few lies, then I shake her like my shirleys
Back in the traffic, mobbin' through the fuckin' town
With the windows down, listening to them fifteens pound
Bumpin' that old school funk, fool
Niggas got to lookin' at us crazy, that ain't even cool
So we was like, "whassup, man?"
Stole on the nigga, now we all throwin' thangs
And they was runnin' like real ho's
Couldn't hang with them thangs, got stomped with the steel toes
Jumped in the mob and start smashin'
Shootin' at them niggas, gettin' sideways, laughin'
Wouldn't even trippin, when we hit the track
Didn't even think about them niggas comin' back
Sittin' in the cut, gettin' drunk as fuck
A car rolled up, lights out and we was all stuck
I heard, "what's up now, nigga?"
Grabbed my fully automatic, put my finger on the trigger
But it was too late to retaliate
They let us have it in the car, wouldn't no escape
I wish I wasn't slippin' when the funk came
Coulda let my nuts hang, grabbed my thang and went insane
Now I'm dead, I did everythang I could
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood

[Chorus: Celly Cel]
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood
Through the hood man
When I'm bailin' thru the hood
The type of shit that happens when I'm bailin' thru my hood

[Interlude: B-Legit & Celly Cel]
B-Legit: Yeah boy, I [?] on this whole hood shit doe, y'know?
Celly: Yeah man, it be some mo' bullshit goin' down the streets, y'know?
B-Legit: Yeah, mother fuckers get smoked in every town though

Celly Cel: Yeah man, well let these mother fuckers know about that old hillside life though, playa
B-Legit: Oh that old hillside life?
Celly Cel: Yeah, let these niggas know man'
B-Legit: Check game

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
The hills got this nigga loc'd
It's broccoli endo smoke, in my lungs
I'm tryna keep these young bitches strung
On candy, mo' famous than [?]
In my hood, so when I bell, it's all good
Hop in the dropper, 'bout to take a ride through the town
Hit the gas and got the old school off the ground
Never made a sound, as I crawled and crept
And snatched yo' bitch as I left the set
Up through the park, my cut dog still barkin'
But it ain't no dank, so I ain't parkin'
Ain't spunkin', but baby need to smoke Louie
I get attacked in the back and watch her run through me
Straight do me, to me but I can't kiss ya
I got to get you back home befo' yo' pops miss ya
Wish you luck bitch, thanks for the fuck bitch
And if you claimin', then you will be a stuck biaatch

[Outro: B-Legit and Celly Cel]

B-Legit: 'Cause I don't want the baby
Celly Cel: That's right
B-Legit: Haha, I just want the pussy
Celly Cel: Haha, yeah, let 'em know
B-Legit: Yeah, fuck and get up is how we do these stank ho's
