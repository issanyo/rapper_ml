Playa-istic shit
By dino boys
Tryin' to get these hoes for every nook & cranny
And make 'em join
The winning team
Ain't nothin' but realness
I know they feel this
Ain't nothin' but sponges
Waitin' for me to leak or slip & spill this
Game I got at an early age by watchin' all the G's
Rat heads get nothin' but cheese
And drop down on they knees wit ease
I make 'em blow me
Then I tell that ho to blow my homie
Ho, don't ya know me?
When you say you love me, I make you show me
If you ain't never sucked no dick, you best recognize
Don't be surprised when you see my nut
Splashin' between your eyes
Don't even know these hoes
They come up out they clothes for me
Feelin' like a camera man on spikes
When they pose for me
I watch 'em rise
Slappin' that ass like they was in the Kentucky... Derby
Bouncin' on my dick
Cuz these hoes love to fuck me
I don't get sprung
I keep 'em trippin' on this game I give 'em
They dirty mack me
But ain't fuckin' wit my playerizm

Playerizm

Shootin' nothin' but that playerizm

Niggas hate me for my playerizm

All I give them is that playerizm

I see PHin' across the nation
Man, it's part of the game
These fallin' souljas stressin'
Cuz they lost they heart in the game
All up under these bitches
Treatin' these hookers like they top-notch
Breakin' off your scrilla
Like you are da only nigga that's hittin' the cock
But when you slip & sleep
At 4 in the mornin', somebody's swoopin'
Up your broad, you might be faithful but your bitch is shoopin'
Shoop be doop
Yeah, now you feel a nigga though
You better feel that ho before you flash & try to kill that ho
Mark ass niggas think they got it sewed up
Lockin' bitches up
Cock blockin' & they still get fucked
Niggas get mad & wanna flash when they hear they ho is loose
Smilin' in my face & wanna blast on that gin & juice
Boostin' up your courage
Now you trippin' cuz your bitch was foul
Checkin' all your homies
Havin' dreams of walkin' her down the isle
Fake playas better recognize what I'm givin'
Toppin' off this game & touchin' niggas wit that playerizm

I'm the type of nigga that catch these hoes
When I'm on my feet
No candy paint to make 'em speak
Don't need no gold ones to make 'em creep
Don't know how to catch a ho
Ask niggas, love to dirty mack
Tellin' yo' business to bitches
Playin' a role like you ain't up under that ass
Pass you in the streets
Pick up they mobile & call yo' bitch
Askin' "where dat nigga at?"
Then turn around & dry snitch
I seen you the other day
With a bitch in a low, tryin' to stop my lounge
But these is he niggas that went from a nothing
I can't understand why they wanna knock my lounge
I learned from the G's
You got to let that shit go
Don't fuck around wit niggas
It gots to be 'bout that money mo'
It's just my playerizm
If they can't figure yet
I'm fuckin' top-notchers
They get burnt like cigarettes
Fuckin' around with hoodrats
Rats in the hood
Get nothin' but cheese & rabies
Welfare checks
Foodstamps
AIDS
And 5 little snotty nosed babies
Ya better recognize that real shit that I'm givin'
Fuck that dirty mackin'
Nigga, hit me wit some playerizm
