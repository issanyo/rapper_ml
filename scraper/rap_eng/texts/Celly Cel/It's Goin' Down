[Verse 1: Celly Cel]
It's goin' down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted
Hit the mall to get it
Then I stop to get my hair twisted up in pony tails
Then sell a bill, back to the grain
And let my peoples know, you know it's goin' down tonight
Mane, we livin'
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin'
We ridin' we them heat, as if they funk
And them we dumpin'
I'm slumpin' in the meantime
My speakers is jumpin' up out they box
I see these broads choosin', man they sprung on my Shirly locks
Ugh, made the block
And they was all up on my bumper
Tryin' to pull me over
But now I gets at nothin' when I'm sober
Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie
Bendin' corners, laughin' cos I left they car cloudy
Went to my patna house, an' they was posted, splittin' Vegas
Bet five dollars a game on Madden '95 on Sega
Tackin' out the room, fools layin' on the ground
They better have some get back cos tonight it's goin' down

[Hook: Kerry]
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down

It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it's gonna go down

[Verse 2: Celly Cel]
Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin' bones
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash
Yellin' "Stand up!" when you pass
Turn over your bones and give me your cash
I hit the sto', with the money I won to get me a 4-0
8 double 0 on the scene, I'm a O-G on the E fo' sho'
I get twisted up in knots, perm straight sloppy
Prize breeders on my nuts and haters wanna mock me
Can't understand how deep I get when I spit this real on reel to reel
Straight up out the hills
Doin' a minute will, steel toe, boot stompin'
Bobbin' my head to the Walkman, get my knees dirty
While I'm stingin' them on the dice for twomps
Side bettin', Little Joe in the doe now watch me roll
I let 'em go and watch that double deuce lock up fo' sho'
I talks bad and clown
Walkin' around and makin' my rounds
Snatchin' my money up off the ground
Cos tonight it's goin' down

[Verse 3: Celly Cel]
Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall
Jumped in my 7-4, smashin' cos I'm tight y'all
Checkin' to see if the Tec was on the passenger seat
I need some heat
The only way I'mma creep
Late night through these faulty streets
Hit the block and seen the whole crew on the corner
Smellin' that aroma, talkin' about the bump and comin' up on her
Super fast, sumpin' cool
You know how we do it
Touch 'em wit' some game
And fill 'em with some doin' fluid
We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin' in
Give me some C&B, some Hennessy and Seagrams Gin
Lemon squeeze but no chasin', fool we straight lacin'
Jumpin' and mobbin', punchin' 'til the both of us playas racin'
We pulls up and see 'em posted outside gettin' gone
I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin' home
Wall to wall breeders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin' down
At this bump I found
Tonight fool, It's Goin' Down
