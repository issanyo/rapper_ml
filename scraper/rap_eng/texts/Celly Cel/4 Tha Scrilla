[Verse 1: Celly Cel]
A slave to the hood, have no money in my pants
Rollin wit some heat to make a mutha fucka dance
Had a chance to bubble, had my hustle but I blew that
I walked up in the gun store and ran out wit a new gat
A double four, I don't want my million dolla mission
211, bitches kissin on my chrome wit skrillas in my vision
Can't move wit out the mail, wanna hustle
So I figga I go out there when they posted up an rush a nigga

[Verse 2: E-40]
But I can go anotha way, (notha way)
Hopefully payday (payday)
What if I slipped and say I dislocated my hip and sue the fuck out of Safeway
That's my new get back
All kinds of things of that flavor
The racateerin, racateerin
Copy bootin-legger
Or however, whatever
Long as the weather's clever
Might pull a heist might become a snitch fo the vice
Ain't no tellin, ain't no tellin
That's what Harold told Melvin. Ten millaaaa
Make a nigga bleed fo the skrilla

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Three drunk niggas wit they gauges loaded (Gauges loaded)
55 kicks in them agents ho (Agents ho)
But I don't wanna beef, cuz the game be fake (Game be fake!)
Strip a mutha fucka fo his cars and money (Fo his cars and money)
Tagged up a 600 SEL (Yeah)
A three way split, me, 40, an Cel (Yeah)
About my mail I was bound to have it (Bound to have it)
See you fuckin wit a mutha fuckin Savage (Biddy-iddy-itch!)

[Hook: Celly Cel & E-40 & B-Legit]
50 ways to get my scratch on fool
I'm a killa fo the skrilla, that's what we do
It's, ah, fo the skrilla, I did it fo the skrilla
See I'm nuthin but a killa doin dirt fo the skrilla

[Verse 4: B-Legit]
Landlord, landlord
Where you at?? (Where ya at!?)
I'm hidin in the bushes wit a baseball bat (baseball bat)
I need that sack that you made today (today)
Or watch me turn into Willie Mays (Willie Mays)

[Verse 5: Celly Cel]
On a mission fo my mail
An you know fo sho we gonna get it
It's the first bitch, gimme yo check so I can flip it
An when I do, she ain't gonna see a penny of this shit
Cryin havin fits, but I'm in it fo the skrilla bitch

[Verse 6: E-40]
Gotta fertilize yo cash an make it greener
Electrictronic scale triple beamer
Juss as sneaky as I wanna be, trifle do
Fuck goin by the books and stickin to them rules

[Verse 7: B-Legit]
Ten is the limit on the card I'm holdin
Citibank Visa, but the card is stolen
Retail price, just pay me half
But you gotta come right with the cash

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 8: E-40]
I done took a few heads fo the skriller Bay
Hope it don't come back an haunt me
Got funk wit like seven different crews
Cuz I done jacked, kidnapped, an did dirt to them fools
Watch my back
Been lookin over my shoulder blades
Hella sneaky cuz I heard them niggas got grenades
I'm from the Bay so regardless what I'm caught up in, this tangle
Can't get up out the Dodge, wit this federal beeper on my ankle

[Verse 9: B-Legit]
Mutha fuckaz don't ride fair no mo
Get snatched out the 9-6, 5 point 0
Took to the hills to get stapled man
While a nigga ride off in a Stang

[Verse 10 : Celly Cel]
Man I need some ends
But to get the ends I gotta sin
Fuck it, let me page a nigga, lie bout what I'm a spend
Bring me a pound, I got it sold on this side of town
You got that yey, you weigh, I pay, fool that's how it's goin down
Bring it in zippers, an I'm a bring the body ripper
The big dipper, wit an extra thirty round clipper
He brought it back, weighed out to the fullest
Little did he know I had his name engraved on my bullet
Dumpin like a fool, served, nigga pumpin gas
Had that heat fo his ass, took his yey an all his cash
I made him feel a, money hungry blood spilla
Straight killa, I did it fo the skrilla

[Hook: 2x]
