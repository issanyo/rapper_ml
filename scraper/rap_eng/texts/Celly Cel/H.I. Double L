(E-40)
Hey ah, which way should I steer ah
The beat keeps knockin down my rearview mirror
Pervin like a mothafucka swervin
Hope I don't scrub in my '95 Suburban
To go throughout the community squattin on gold tippy toes
Peep, breathin on Indian cigarette-Ganish Bidi posin niggas tweak
Quick fast in a hurry, don't worry, 40 vision ain't blurry
Shorty hit the freeways right up the ways, clownin like that nigga Joe Torry
(Celly Cel)
Well, what do you know, it's siggity Cel
That funky niggaro, that funky nigga doe
Kickin in doors, you better grab ya ho
I see ya choosin in the late night
Creepin wit my nigga B-Legit and 40 Water, ah shit
(40)
We're here-we're there-we're everywhere
Highly intox-icated but we don't care
(B-Legit)
I'm from the H.I.L.L. the place where my niggas bail
A Mac muthafuckin 12 will send your ass straight to hell
(40)
A tick, a tock, they shook the spot
They say them crazy muthafuckas pulled out a chop
(B)
I watch them muthafuckas run
I do this shit for fun
You niggas know you can't get none
(40)
Biatch

Chorus-
I'm from the V.A.L.L.E.J.O
H.I.Double.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go)
V.A.L.L.E.J.O
H.I.Double.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go)

(B)
I tell a bitch what the fuck you mean where I've been
And so what I smells like pussy and gin
I had money to make
Bitches to break
And if the shit was out of line I had lives to take
I told you from the gate that I'm a mobster
Sippin DP, eatin lobster
Don't get it confused, you won't get abused
As long as you makin' me them revenues
(Cel)
That miggity mack, that diggity dang and that niggity nut
Jump in the back of my cut with a tramp slut and hit the guts
Ain't got no love for 'em, all I love to do is dick 'em
Pass 'em to the extra mannish nigga, 40 water, sic 'em
(40)
If I was Popeye I woulda told Bluto
'You could kiss my big black royal'
I'm not funkin' over Olive Oyl
Last night I had a superbad in my room
She sucked me 'til my dick shriveled up like a prune
(Cel)
Well pass the hussy to the left hand side
So I can bend her over, hit it from the back, and let her ride
You know a Sick Wid It hog gotta put the shake down
Shoot her to the left, nigga, hit me with that breakdown

Chorus
I'm from the V.A.L.L.E.J.O
H.I.Double.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go)
V.A.L.L.E.J.O
H.I.Double.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (off to the liquor sto')

(40)
Beefeater, Tanqueray, Sapphire, Bombay
Either that or a punch bowl full of Hurricane Ethel
That'll last a nigga dang near all day
Smokin' herb, we gets perved, cop a squat
Let's hang out at the old Cola spot
(B)
Nigga, I'm a Looie, smokes damn near Q
So can I get a Twomp on my pager bill
You been blowin' me up
I know you know the code
31 double 07 dash 9 eleven
(40)
High steppin'
Ya blankin off the blanks
Cuz I'm a "Rock star"
Here go dove rock, nigga, let me use your fuckin car
All the way through
Sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday
Threw up money tore up ass bootch you call the po po on me
Told 'em I was sideways doin about a buck 50 in Solano County
Sheriffs pull my ass over, and book me, caught me with a gun
And a bunch of Aliz√© bottles and they was askin me where I'm from
And I said...BITCH!

Chorus
I'm from the V.A.L.L.E.J.O
H.I.Double.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go)
V.A.L.L.E.J.O

Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go)
