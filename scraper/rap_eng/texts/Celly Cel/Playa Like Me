[Hook: Keak da Sneak]
I'm a playa, that's all I'll ever be
And they don't, they don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me

[Verse 1: Keak da Sneak]
What'chu you feedin that baby cake
Asthma got me on that ass like a license plate
Rear end you, whiplash, I didn't see your brakes
Monster truck so I'm getting crushed when I'm on the race
I ain't a hater, baby, keep your man
He gon' spend time wit'chu, cuddle up and hold your hands
I'm your playa partna, friend
You a groupie, bopper, a fan
Doin' the tatter puddy or the hand stand
Charm ya before I harm ya
Get her 'fore I forget her
Strip her 'fore I rip her
Sit up before i bent her
Break up before I enter
I'm tryna see what's in her
Teamwork make winners
I see ya jockin' while i'm rockin'
Peekin' but you ain't speakin on it
Juicy mouth, wet, extra spit, no gleakin' on it
I'm fienin', tweakin' on it
Sick from the dick
Ay girl, I'm a playa, baby...

[Hook: Keak da Sneak]
'Cause I'm a playa, that's all I'll ever be
And they don't, they don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me...

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I'm Town vintage, Oakland original
I ride clean, I smoke and I'm pimpin' hoes
Started with nothin' and made a whole lot
For a long time; I get everything a hoe got
And I owe it all to the Town
For lacing me, showed a nigga how to get down
I got 4 hustles and they all make change
"Short, where you get all that game?" From the Eastside
Wit' a fine little broad, street meat ride
Wit' the purp and the pills, keep me high
And the youngstas on the scraper bikes, keep ridin'
I'm on the Eastside
Home of the infamous Keak da Sneak
Been known for pimpin' his freaks for weeks
And me, I'm a boss, whatever I do
Ay Keak, tell 'em 'bout you

[Hook 2X: Keak da Sneak]
'Cause I'm a playa, that's all I'll ever be
And they don't, they don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me...

[Verse 3: Celly Cel]
Always been a stunna, always been shinin'
Ran with the breezys ever since i start timin'
Y'all can have the nickels, all I want is the dimes and
I'mma skip the foreplay, straight to the grindin'
Give it to her like she never had it before
Celly in the building and we all in the doe
They don't make 'em no more, they on some other shit, mayne
Mad at the game, and it's all on a bitch, mayne
I won't explain, you shoulda soaked it, mayne, you know what's up
I'm in it for the money but you in it for the nut
I got hella bitches and they know about each other
You got one bitch and you keep it undercover
If a nigga take her from you, then you wanna fight
If you not mine, I'll have 10 by tomorrow night
Riding shotgun, tryna make more money
With a black girl, a señorita, and a snow bunny

[Hook: Keak da Sneak]
'Cause I'm a playa, that's all I'll ever be
And they don't, they don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me...

[Verse 4: Keak da Sneak]
It's a time and a place for that gangsta shit
Your chick bad, I'mma smack the bitch and yank her quick
You doin' it wrong
I back her up and get gone, real talk on my songs
Right or wrong, banging loyalty, bagging sautéed nuts
Like ODB, I like it raw but never when I fuck
Like what, the business, gotta give it to her
Fresh outta Folsom when I dose 'em, you know how I do her
187 Pure, on the One like Spice
Catch me out in Chico with an Asian, yeah, rice for life
First class on a Boston flight
Tonight, twins I chase suck nice
It's a gift to make a dick shoot swift
She'll do it on a natural, choosing on a young pimp
Trap herself with somethin' limp
Sauce, man, butter like she love sautéeing shrimp

[Hook 2X: Keak da Sneak]
'Cause I'm a playa, that's all I'll ever be
And they don't, they don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me
They don't make 'em no more like me...
