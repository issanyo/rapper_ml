[Verse 1: Celly Cel]
What you niggas thought? Gossipin' like bitches on the under
Tryin' to keep it on the slunder 'cause I made you wonder
If I was down 'cause I rap now, what that mean?
I'm 'posed to raise up out the hood and leave my seventeen
Shot Glock on the block like I want peace?
The only peace I'm gon' get is when I'm deceased
(So you still funkin'?) Yeah, if I got to
Trigger finger itchin' and I just might pop you
Glock to a muthafucka head in the 9-5
(Oh, so you gon' buck 'em down just so you can stay alive?)
I thought you knew, but these fools keep crossin' me
And I be feelin' like the devil got lost in me
When I flash (So nigga, you a killa?)
Mamas and babies, they say I'm crazy 'cause I give a
Nigga one chance not to fuck with me
'Cause when you fuck with me, I gots to take your whole family
(Man you sick.) Nah, I ain't got shit to lose
And ain't no rules, I been locked up in county blues
All they can do is send me to the pen with the locs
To get my yokes
And walk the yard with my folks
I'm gettin' smoked, but a judge give me 25
When I get caught, I'm a blast, what you niggas thought?

[Chorus: Kevin Gardner & Celly Cel]
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?

[Verse 2: Celly Cel]
(Man, you nationwide, why you still kickin' it?)
'Cause nina ross got a thirty-round clip in it
And we can take ten paces then draw
'Fore you turn around, I'll take two and blow off your jaw
Ain't nothin' fair in the hood, I dare a nigga to stare
At the barrel of my hair pin trigga and square up
Watch his body flare up like some Duraflame
Heart pumpin' Kool-Aid, now he's sweet as sugar cane
(I thought you was quiet, but now I see you into violence.)
Killas don't talk, real niggas move in silence
And I'm a silently creep up on these niggas slowly
And split the funeral money with Cooley & Rioli
Homie don't ya know me? I'm that nigga wit the weapons
Y'all can have them hoes, I'm finger fuckin' Smith & Wessons
Testin' my nuts will get you split in half, a bloody bath
Is what you get for crossin' my path as I bail and laugh
(Niggas like you get smoked everyday.)
I'm one of the walkin' dead any-muthafuckin'-way
(I don't even trip when them fools be muggin' me.)
They wanna see the thug in me, dead with a slug in me
It's do or die, slip, creep or get crept on
Makin 'em swallow thirty-two hollow tips when they swept-on
Rollin' wit the heater, if fools get smoked it ain't my fault
Plottin' on catchin' a muthafucka slippin', what you niggas thought?

[Chorus: Kevin Gardner & Celly Cel]
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?

[Verse 3: Celly Cel]
(What they be thinkin' when they see you creepin' through the streets?)
They wanna split me, but they know I'm boxin' wit my heat
And under my seat, it's in my lap, I got it cocked back
Whatever the destination, can't be loose 'cause they be peelin' caps
(Yeah, I feel you.) Nah, I don't even feel myself
So quick to blast, I can't get smoked unless I kill myself
(Damn.) I lost my mind when I bought my nine
Fill it up with a thirty round clip, Black Talon tips'll open your blinds
Ain't throwin' them thangs, so fool put your hands down
Bailin' through your hood to catch you slippin' with your pants down
'Cause when you slip, you're put to sleep, it ain't no wakin' up
I got these Betty Crocker-ass niggas cakin' up
Peekin' out the window, smoked like indo, smoked like Purple Kush
The shit that get you stuck when you see me raisin' up outta the bush
(So you be creepin' on the late night, right?)
Nah, the best way to kill a nigga is in broad daylight
(Like that?) I thought you knew me but you went soft
Now it's about time I cut your mutha-fuckin water off
Stompin' in my steel-toes, bailin' wit my H-I
Double L west niggas, puttin' y'all to rest niggas
Bring the chalk, scrape the bodies off the asphalt
It's on when you in my zone, what you niggas thought?

[Chorus: Kevin Gardner & Celly Cel]
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?
Bring the chalk
Bring the chalk
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin' asphalt
It's on when you're in my zone, Yeah, yeah
What you niggas thought?
What you niggas thought?
