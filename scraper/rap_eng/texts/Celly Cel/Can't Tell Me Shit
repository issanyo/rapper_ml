[Intro]
Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka
Once again, you know
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all
You know, nothin' but that realness
Can ya feel this though
Yeah.. Gonna ride wit ya nigga cuz it's goin' down

They say break yo'self or make yo'self
So I said fuck it, bought a Glock so I could take myself
Through all this old shit a nigga face as a youngsta
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice
In & out the pen, real niggas made nothin' nice
Made this hog hit the brew
Made me hit the weed
Eatin' up the whole house
Moms know a nigga keyed
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door
Tellin' myself "I ain't smokin' weed no more"
But you know
Them lies as the days go by
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise
Walk into the school house
Franklin Junior
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1
Fools throwin' thangs to the end
Back then, it was fun
No gunshots
No need to hit the floor
But after shool
The whole city loccin up
At Wilson park fool
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs
Chasin' Fly Balls for hot dogs & fries bitch
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit

1 - (Can't tell me shit)
Bitch made niggas can't tell a nigga shit
(They can't tell me shit)
Skanlezz Azz Bytchez can't tell a nigga shit
(Can't tell me shit)
Punk police can't tell a nigga shit
(They can't tell a nigga shit)
Fuck you bitch - you can't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1

Got a little older, now the park is a joke
Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit
So I mind my own, find my home
Now I'm in the zone
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind
Brakes went to quarters, halfs, ounces & QP's
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go
To Hogan High cause there be bitches at the talent show
Football & hoop games had hoes
Vallejo and Hogan, you know it was on fo' sho'
Reece assists & Redge with the Tamahawk dunk
Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront
Niggas in Granadas, Cougars & Mustangs
Stars & Vogues
Nobody fuckin' with them gold thangs
Me, G-Roc, JB & Lil' C-Mo
Puffin' on indo
Splittin' 4 double O Z's
Young G's tryin' to live
And when they shut the ship door, we goin' under the bridge
Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip
Cause back then, you couldn't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Made it to a G, but ain't no love in my city
Now we set trippin', all these fools actin' shitty
Niggas wanna reel me in, but didn't know
When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral
No more toe to toe
HK-44's
Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows
Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area
Shit is gettin' scarier
Niggas will bury ya'
Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' through early
Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on
Christian brothas and chasin' it with Schlitz
Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click
So deep, I can't call it
Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store
I'm just an alcoholic
40, Water & Legit put me on the map
Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dap
Sick Wit It slash Jive, my 9 to 5
The shit I used to dream about is how I survive
Lifestyle of a mack
Funk for life
Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz
Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash
Without a murda weapon or a witness
Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business
They turn snitches
Break down & have the po-po's at yo' front door
And all real niggas know
Who rides sucka-free, on the solo
When you empty the clip, they can't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1
