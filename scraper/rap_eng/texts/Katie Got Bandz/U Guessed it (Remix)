Bitch stop Flexin'
Bandz in the building with weapons
Run up on my squad and get [?]
Them choppers they blow 'em
My shooters be scorin'
Left the murder scene with the detectives
Katie Got Bandz on her shit
I can't fuck with them
Now I'm so high im in heaven
Flexin' on me get you knocked the fuck out
Or them Hittaz might hit you no questions
My squad stay on dummy
The Uzi be drummin'
He hit from a distance we stretched 'em
Don't come to me talking if it ain't about money
Or something that we can get rich from
We always on dummy with 30's and 40's
Don't like it then pull up and do something
Just know that you oppin'
The shooter we uppin' the aim
So we ain't gone miss none
My momma, my daddy they always been savage
So when they had Katie it's been one
I'm packed in this shit
And I'm taking off on 'em
You see 'em, I'm coming, I'm on one
My killers grade A
Ain't no testin'
Bitches shaking and shivering, stressing
I say, "Who the real queen of Chiraq?"
And they scream, "Katie Bandz!"
I'm like, "Lil bitch, you guessed it!"

Bitch stop Flexin'!
