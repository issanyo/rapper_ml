[Chorus: Nick Carter Green]
Bitches blasting low life
Fuck them on my own time
She might get the phone line
But she might get the dial tone
Left that girl with no right
Maybe she should dial home
Bitch, I’m real on both sides
Let that nigga die so I change your life
I rock chain after chain, after chain, after chain
Just to show them I’m balling
I rock ring after ring, after ring, after ring
Just to show them I’m all in
She know I’m too official
Swag is dripping, get a tissue
Into the grays with me
Darken shades with me, oh girl

[Verse 1: Sasha Go Hard]
Look, don’t want the plates
Just want your face
Come after eight
Pussy so sweet
How it taste?
Eating it like he trying to win a race
I give no fuck what they say
I’m a winner
No, I could never be yo bae
I could never be erased
Pretty, petite, 25 in the waist
I’m in love with the Benz
Girl, keep your man
He could not get a chance
No competition, I win
I’m on a mission
Don’t see him, no lens
No time to kick it
So walk it out
I’m not your girl
What you talking ‘bout?
Turn to a beast
I will put you out
Show me the money
I want it now
You know I be cooling getting money
Don’t compare me to them bitches ‘cause they bummy
You know I be cooling getting money
Don’t compare me to them bitches ‘cause they bummy

[Chorus: Nick Carter Green]
Bitches blasting low life
Fuck them on my own time
She might get the phone line
But she might get the dial tone
Left that girl with no right
Maybe she should dial home
Bitch, I’m real on both sides
Let that nigga die so I change your life
I rock chain after chain, after chain, after chain
Just to show them I’m balling
I rock ring after ring, after ring, after ring
Just to show them I’m all in
She know I’m too official
Swag is dripping, get a tissue
Into the grays with me
Darken shades with me, oh girl

[Verse 2: Katie Got Bandz]
I say I’m too official
Tell the referee blow the whistle
Balling, no hooping
But be with the shooters
So smash on the competition
Loving my life so I live it
Get the dough
Stack it and flip it
Haters just hate for a living
Main reason why they ain’t getting it
Can’t trust a nigga cause they really shiesty
And a boss like me quite pricey
Take a foreign ride
Fingers to sky
Bottle after bottle
Miss me with the lies
Now he hit the line
Cause you out of line
Boy you wasting time
And I ain’t got it
Got some bands
And you can’t have it
Get you ran down in open traffic
I’ma break you down for the systematic
Brace yourself ‘cause you too dramatic
Shit was basic then I jumped the barrel
Went from rags to riches to designer fabrics
I ain’t tripping ‘cause you had me
Turned from joy to the bad me
Fuck the beef, go and get the bag
I’ll do it gladly

[Chorus: Nick Carter Green]
Bitches blasting low life
Fuck them on my own time
She might get the phone line
But she might get the dial tone
Left that girl with no right
Maybe she should dial home
Bitch, I’m real on both sides
Let that nigga die so I change your life
I rock chain after chain, after chain, after chain
Just to show them I’m balling
I rock ring after ring, after ring, after ring
Just to show them I’m all in
She know I’m too official
Swag is dripping, get a tissue
Into the grays with me
Darken shades with me, oh girl

[Outro: Nick Carter Green]
I might hit tonight
Might get lit tonight
Alright, this the life
