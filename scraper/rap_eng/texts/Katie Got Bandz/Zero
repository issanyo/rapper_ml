I think I know why these bitches mad
Cause I’m steady counting these zeros

Cause I’m steady counting these zeros

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Aye I check the score board and why shawty still got zero
And ya bank account the same amount but that was on the D-low
She probably look like a model but for a dollar bet she bop-bop-bop like Kemo
Aye I’m the illest girl in the league say I’m so sick I’ma need Chemo
And ya boy keep touching on me
I’ma have to get a free throw
I got all A’s up in school now why I keep getting zeros
Bet I ball on a bitch all net like I’m tryna catch Nemo
And girl I know you go to bed mad at me like you playing out Ne-yo
My niggas cracking cards cause it’s stack or starve
But they probably leave yo shit zeroed
I’m all about my bread well I want extra cheese
I like my money how I like my [?]
He hate my attitude but love my ego
I told him eat it up like he a Leo
Then it’s adios like the Migos
Cause I’m back to chasing them zeros

[Hook 2: Dreezy]
Zero, zero zero
Zero, zero
Zero, zero zero
Zero, Zero

Zero, zero zero
Zero, zero
Zero, zero zero
Zero, Zero

[Verse 2: Sasha Go Hard]
Spend it all I don’t save money not a hero
Pussy bopping on his face like I’m Lil Kemo
Bitch act tough get touched get fucked up take yo Negro
All this fucking money fuck you suck my ego
Name another bitch take a flight 24 to go overseas
If they ain’t do it right real shit why the fuck hoes mad at me
I’m a muhfuckin beast I intimidate a bitch put ya man on a leash
Cause ya man wanna eat like a feast
But you don’t understand not a man that I need
You can keep him
Spending that money like fuck it
I promise I’ll double it back
Niggas not nothing don’t trust him
He said that he love you he bluffing
I swear that he lying
I keep it on the d low
You don’t need to know how it go with the zeros
Ain’t gotta flex
Ain’t got a check yet
But I bet niggas can’t compare to my zeros

[Hook 2: Dreezy]
Zero, zero zero
Zero, zero
Zero, zero zero
Zero, Zero

Zero, zero zero
Zero, zero
Zero, zero zero
Zero, Zero


[Verse 3: Katie Got Bandz]
Bandz bitch I got zeros
Hollows bust and leave zeros
Caught a move on a B.O.A if its ass sweetie get zeroed
I see them bands Ms. Cleo
These broke hoes don’t see though
Worth a mill just signed a deal so I’m steady adding on zeros
Pop out with a bag on me
Keep talking put that bag on him
Riding around with that mag on and if a bitch mad then slide on me
No fool shit
Shawty shoot shit
Hollows bang and go through shit
Talk slick and get ya boo hit
I got zeros I can buy a hit
Foreign fast I can fly and shit
Hoes just wanna die and shit
Katie winning you should call it quits
In KOD giving bitches rent
A penny earned and a penny spent
Try and poke me niggas got me bent
I ain’t buy a house bitch I bought guns
Where the fuck you think my advance went

[Hook 1: Dreezy]
