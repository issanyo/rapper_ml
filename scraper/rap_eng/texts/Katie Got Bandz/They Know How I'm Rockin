These hoes droppin, no broke heels

You want beef, we in the field
Not playin' cards, but they know the deal
Lame hoe, you a stank hoe
No Chief Keef, but we bang hoe
School gang bang, like Fredo
My money stacked, like seven folds
All day like 24 hours
Bitch a sour, pussy wetter a shower

Killin' beats, but a flowers
Miss obstacles, I got the power

You a lame bitch, bitch beat yo [?]
Fuck girl don't want no beef (tru)
