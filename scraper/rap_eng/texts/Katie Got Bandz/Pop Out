[Hook: Katie Got Bandz]
I only rock designer when I pop out
Pull up in that foreign then I hop out
Bag full of bands, brought the bank out
I only fuck with hittas, so they pop out
Pop out, pop out
Pop out, I'm flexing when I pop out
Pop out, tell them bitches pop out
Catch a opp lackin , liking when we gon' pop out

[Verse 1: Katie Got Bandz]
Katie in the shit, I'm about to pop out
Fuck that Twitter beef, bitch, pop out
My hittas be on point with that Gloc out
Catch yo' ass lackin , you get stretched out
Catch me down in Neiman's watch I cash out
And everything designer when I step out
Caught a gun in case I have to bail out
The law mad, I won't snitch, I'm not no sell out
Fuck the jakes, tell them let cayo back out
And I might be the mess for them, I drill out
Any off the shits till I pass out
They like cady gibb, plus it when she pop out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Gucci, Louie, Prada, when I pop out
Missmatcher designer and it's not out
Bitch, I'm smoking dope, it's simply knocked down
D12 nut, then I knock out
I be round four, counting bands with Katie
My niggas shooting shit up when they come with hating
Pull a trigger's bullets pop out
Hit him in his face, brains pop out
Danger is outside, you better go in
Killers for design, for the low in
Fucks your baby momma for a soul in
It's like eeverytime I pop, they be going in

[Hook]
