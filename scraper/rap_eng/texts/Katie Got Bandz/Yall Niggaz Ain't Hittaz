[Verse 1]
I been chasin' that bank
Hittaz all on my heels
Bitches sneak dissin' hate, like they ready to drill
Katie in it no lie, still fightin' that case
A thot play with my money, I put a hole in her face (drill)
My bitches be in that field
Chiraq known for the drill
My little hittaz still hungry, I'm tryna get em a meal (bandz)
My OG need a new house, still be high on dem bills
So ain't shit you can tell me, I'm going in for the kill
Bitches frontin' they move, tryna rap like bandz
I salute them weak bitches, cause to me them hoes fans
Trip that shit on a mans, them thots ain't living this life
And if you think that I'm lyin'
Then we drillin' tonight (bandz)

[Hook]
Yall niggas ain't hittaz (bandz)
(repeat 4x)
These hoes ain't drilliin' (nah)
(repeat 4x)
Yall niggas ain't hittaz (bandz)
(repeat 4x)
These hoes ain't drillin' (nah)
(repeat 4x)

[Verse 2]
Doing hits by myself
Cause niggas work with da' feds
I can't rock with broke bitches, I'm tryna be a bed
Zero time for opps, play with me I'ma bang
I can't go on my life, real shit don't get changed
Hittaz claiming my name (Katie), cause they know I'm the shit
But they hoes be hatin', ain't got no love for they bitch
But I love all my bitches, they be down for that action
And we ain't throwin' them hands, but we swingin' them righteous
Catch em lackin' in traffic, watch how quick she get tragic
Have em tracin' them bodies, and zip in that plastic
50 shots and a clip
I can barely carry
Fuck a aim, just blow
I bet a couple get buried
Bitches say that they with it, but I'm knowin' they scary
I'm killin' they dreams, they should be callin' me Freddy
And I'm tired of talkin', leave that shit to yo wife
And I'ma just start showin' em, they ain't bout that life (turn up)

[Hook]
Yall niggas ain't hittaz (bandz)
(repeat 4x)
These hoes ain't drilliin' (nah)
(repeat 4x)
Yall niggas ain't hittaz (bandz)
(repeat 4x)
These hoes ain't drillin' (nah)
(repeat 4x)
