[Verse]
I remember nights I ain't had shit
No remy weave , no new kicks
Kickin doors, running out that shit
If we came up we split the hit
Now Im ballin, WMBA
[?]
I remember when I did a lot of work
Now Im dreaming foriegns in my drive way
[?] but they shit falling when they poppin out
Look bitch how you ballin out
You aint never ever gonna go with the cash out
How the fuck you's a hitta nigga
Ain't never scored behind the trigger nigga
If a bitch really want smoke
Then this body bag will be a swisher nigga
BOB , I'm a big ole bitch
Boss shit and I'm with the shit
Came up at 12 bars now my whole team in designer shit
Fuck a glo bitch I'm in my glory
And my hittas shooting like Robert Horry
Katie Bandz on that fuck shit and I ain't writing verse
Bitch I'm telling stories
Niggas bitches call em Tyler Perry
Twitter beefing but I know their scared
Bottles running Bitch I'm rockin' medals
Killing dreams they should call me Freddy
[?]
Chasin money,cash it in a hurry
You want to you kill me you got to show me
Got some young killas that'll drop by
On the nine I'ma die here
Everybody gone ride here
Three [?] stuck to one blunt now a bitch buss like Light year
Stop lying it's my year sneak dissing don't fly here
Talk crazy bitch meet the eighty like Dej Loaf come try me

Ill be at the mall
All we do is ball
So my money talk
We dont ball [?]
Thats the quickest way to fall
Like mill I'm coachin
And my young boys come in
No talkin, face down
