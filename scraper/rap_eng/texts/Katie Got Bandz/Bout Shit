[Verse 1:]

Ima keep it 1 hunnid
Im so tired of being settle
All the favors i been giving out
You niggas need to pay me double, uh
You wanna tell me be humble, why?
Cuz you ain't never had shit
You niggas wearing Ferragamo
I be wearing nigga, "what the fuck is that nigga"
I be on my shit like every day
Tell a broke nigga get out of my way
Rockin wit real niggas since before jay
These chains on may (me)
Are like slavery
I say baby please
Break down that swisher
When I'm no longer
Just take out that picture
I know you wishing that i would be witcha'
But I'd be so stingy
I could not deliver
I could not deliver
I could not be focused
I flex in a beamer
They tell me I'm bogus
I changed my demeanor
I think that they hopeless
My town say I'm winning
I tell them i know this
They noticed
And don't come around
If that sound that you ground ain't potent
And all my niggas got black on them like the fucking omen

[Chorus - Katie]

These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These bands get me flexing on 'ya bitch
Finesse a bag, in a foreign when i whip
Why you mad lil bitch? Don't trip
These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These broke niggas ain't bout shit

[Verse 2:]

Riding around on that trippy shit
Rolling up on these Benjamin's
Yo nigga wanna get intimate
When he around you though, he be innocent
I command that nigga like a militant
Then he count my cash up in increments
You love that ho
What a coincidence
You said you'd never love a ho
You're a hypocrite
Bang
Bang (bangers)
Watch them shoot for the stars
Had beef with a real one (real one)
Now they shooting at cars (bow)
In the cold but it feel warm
In the city it's hard
So shout out to them real niggas
Who be out in the yard

[Chorus - Katie]

These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These bands get me flexing on 'ya bitch
Finesse a bag, in a foreign when i whip
Why you mad lil bitch? Don't trip
These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These broke niggas ain't bout shit
These broke niggas ain't bout shit
