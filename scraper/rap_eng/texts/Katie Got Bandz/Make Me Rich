[Hook: Chi Hoover]
I woke up, uh
Tell her make them bands and bring me some
I need all my money every month
You gon' run it like you owe me somethin'
Now make me rich, make me rich
I need 'bout two strippers more than one
Won't you shake your ass and show me somethin'
Bands on bands, I make me more than one
Now make me rich

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I got bottles on bottles
Got bitches on bitches, they kissin' each other in French
I fell in love with the new Maserati
Said, "Fuck it," and went 'head and copped a new Benz
I don't go one on one
I got like too many girls, I go crazy, got bitches I throw away
Throw up the money, blue hunnits
Got bleu cheese and bitches all under my wing and you know it
Get it back quick as I spend it
Throw it up, yeah she up on the pole spinnin'
You got no win when I'm steppin' up in it
Bossin' up on this shit, y'all niggas rentin'
Don't want no known, on my own with my bitch
And you know that I love when she bring me them Benjis
On her knees like religion
Got night life, you can get the bomb if you act right
When I put the cameras on blacklight
Bet you act right
Got all these girls in the back now
All my niggas throwin' up a stack now

[Hook: Chi Hoover]
You gon' run it like you owe me somethin'
Now make me rich, make me rich
I need 'bout two strippers more than one
Won't you shake your ass and show me somethin'
Bands on bands, I make me more than one
Now make me rich

[Verse 2: Katie Got Bandz]
Make me rich, don't want spend that shit
I'm just takin' hunnas, keep your tip
Bottle after bottle, pour that liq'
Roll up what I like and now I'm lit
I'm the shit
Katie Got Bandz in the buildin', y'all know I'm gon' kill it
Throwin' up dollars, she straight for them ballers
She all on the ceilin', it's all for the riches
I don't even strip but your BF gon' tip me
Walk in the club and my diamonds on dizzy
Order some bottles, gotta get a thotty
She turnt off a bit so let's see up the party
Breakin' them bands like I practice karate
They all on the floor, got me walkin' on bitches
Hundreds and 50s and bottles of Remy
Stack bands and throw 'em because I got plenty
[?] jewels because I got bank
Tell me that issue, I'm grippin' that pistol
See I'm so official, you should blow the whistle
Get rid of faces, get back to the basics now make me rich

[Hook: Chi Hoover]
Now make me rich, make me rich
I need 'bout two strippers more than one
Won't you shake your ass and show me somethin'
Bands on bands, I make me more than one
Now make me rich, make me rich

[Bridge: Jeremih]
You can shake your ass until tomorrow
I'ma eat it then kiss it like tomorrows
They don't wanna stop me [?]
I would take a shower but you're better when you're naked
I don't really [?], I just wild out on my indo
Smokin' on that indo, bad bitch rollin' up the indo
We don't [?], all we goin' for the cheddar
Bleu cheese, hundred faces, blue faces, I'm eatin' better

[Outro: Chi Hoover + Katie Got Bandz]
Now make me rich, make me rich
