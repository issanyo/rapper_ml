[Verse]
I'm on fire lil bitch
So I did part two
For the chi(cago) lil bitch
Don't lie lil bitch
We know you do dicks
When you dry lil bitch why lie lil bitch You ain't gang
You just giving niggas brain lil bitch It's a shame lil bitch
Just fucking niggas just to get some insta fame lil bitch
But I'm about to switch up the flow
That bitch be bussing
We know you a hoe say that you got it
We know you a hoe
How the fuck you bad but you dirty and broke
I just had to let them know I be stacking commas
Getting bands on the low
Brought a new chopper with a stand
I don't even got to hold it I can sit it on the floor
Bitches looking for me I be posted on the low
Niggas is bitches I can heard she a hoe
Talking the shit until we knock on your door
Open that bitch everybody on the floor
Katie got bandz I be on my boss shit
Giving out names they be on that law shit
Bitches is bussing they on that thot shit
Snatching my chain you going to feel that hot shit
I'm making noise everytime I drop shit
Blockondatrackk then you know it's a hit and I'm off dope
I be higher than a bitch
Don't come around trying to put five to my shit
