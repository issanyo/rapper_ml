[Intro]
Katie!
I'm in the field, bitch!
Bow bow!

[Hook x2: Katie Got Bandz]
All my hitters TTG, bitch we doing hits (Bow bow!)
Don’t fuck with lames, we gang bang, ho I’m in this shit
Katie making noise, (Katie!)
Queen of drills bitch (drill 'em)
We keep them ratchets, don’t be lackin' in the field bitch (bow bow!)


Bow bow [x3]
We keep them ratchets, don’t be lackin' in the field bitch
Bow bow [x4]

(Katie!) [x4]

[Verse 1]
Don’t be lackin' when it’s crackin' in the field bitch! (bow bow!)
Shit real, Katie live for this drill shit (Katie!)
Thots oppin', when it’s poppin', like they with the shits (oppin')
Catch her lackin' with her man, it’s a drill bitch! (Drill!)
I ain’t gotta say shit, no talkin' (True!)
And I keep the move learn, be cautious
Let it bang, I got aim, it’s a hit target
Count hunnas, I’m a stunna, like Steve Austin
Who want smoke, who want smoke
That designer and that flexin' that'll get you caught
I’m band up, I’m racked out (racks!)
50 shots will turn her blouse to a back out (Bandz)

Bow bow!
Katie! Katie!
We keep them ratchets, don’t be lackin' in the field bitch!
Bow bow [x4]

[Hook x2]
All my hitters TTG, bitch we doing hits, (bow, bow)
Don’t fuck with lames, we gang bang, ho I’m in this shit
Katie making noise, (Katie!)
Queen of drills bitch (Drill 'em)
We keep them ratchets, don’t be lackin' in the field bitch (bow bow!)
