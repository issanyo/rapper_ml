[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
Mental foggy with the melancholy running with a felons body
Selling Molly ducking federallis
Jealous posse models wink inside elevator lobby
Got the box seat set up  how we celebrate and party
Taylor made Cavalli also lay up in Canarsie
Martini Rossi sipping now we switch the car seats
Relax like the shape of suits on Steve Harvey
NDL varsity jackets up in the Barclays
Moxie of a winner all you see the glitter
Very far removed from days of TV dinners
Lunch with the minister no pictures out in public with her
Got the biopic on the way texting the publisher
Whoever fronted now I'm snubbing em
No subs eating breakfast grubbing up in Dublin
Numbers doubling and tripling Napoleon
My art should have a place Smithsonian

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
I move the crowd move units move the score on the board
Moving bodies like a coroner when I'm on tour
Meet with ambassadors what up Paul? What's happening?
I say it real like bars after which u put a facts in it (facts)
Maximum ILL my chill is automatic ILL-Matic
Troublesome the clothe that I'm cut from is real fabric
U polyester I'm a jolly good fella
Bread expands shoot with red cams Hollywood set ups
Haters mad when u this nice how could u mess up?
If I made that type of music probably would be fed up
But I don't, Midas touch platinum plus you mad much?
I'm what happens when u talk and then u back it up
Action speaks loud peace clown
Have a seat enjoy the show I'm a beast clown
Dennis rodman offensive when I rebound
Stopping the gun violence rather send a message with a beat down
