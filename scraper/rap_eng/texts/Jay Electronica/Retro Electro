Somebody stop me, lord I'm on fire
Sucker emcees better call me sire
I won't stop rockin til the moon retire
Til the prophecy's fulfilled and the earth catch fire
Nope, I ain't trying to be going back into poverty
Working a nine-to-five and be hopin I hit the lottery
Nope, I came too far to turn back on my
Heels like a windmill and head back home-a
I eat a emcee up like Jeffrey Dahmer
Parlaying up in V.I.P. playing the corner
Im hot like a sauna
I spit a hot shot off of the top you're a goner
Somebody call the coroner
These wack emcees is D.O.A
They label you as a hater when you see yo' way
But, if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
You can catch me in the Third Ward throwin' it up
You might find me in the nine where they don't mind dying
Screamin' five-o in the back of the line
Everytime that I fall up in the spot I shine
Heel up wheel up bring it back home rewind

I just wanna keep the peace like a Buddhist
But niggas wanna kiss me on my cheek like Judas
Nigga, then lets do this
I leave em left out, left field, left clueless
They feed off of rumors til I hit em with the trueness
They don't hate me
They hate God I ain't make me
Im just a little nigga on the mic with a breakbeat
What have y'all lames done for me lately
Nada, I keep on movin' and dont bother
The flow's H-2-O, they drown in the water
Step right up and come down to the slaughter
See me in the Third Ward, 6-4 Impala
Brush off my shoulder and pop my collar, holla
See I don't even walk like a piiimmmp, talk like a mack all I do is rap....
Uh, you other motherfuckers is wack and that's a actual fact (that's a actual fact)

You sucka emcees bow down like west side, connec-tion
My pimp arm is way too strong I bring pressure
Wilin' like Stalin when he reigned over Russia
Never ever scared but I ain't Bone Crusher
More like Benito, Adolfo
Who can spit greater and rip the dictator? Nigga I thought so
No one. Rap's Red China; I'm the shogun
Ass-ass-in
Tear a emcees ass and
Spit with a passion
I'm on stage laughin
They couldn't swallow the whole
I gave em fractions
War with the dragon
Man you know the M.O
Me and mr porter in the Cadillac limo
Detroit vi-a the streets of the N.O
New Or-le-ans
Don Corleone
I'm on the porch with a straw hat and a cordless phone
Mink king on my humble throne I'm in the zone
Hot shot and then I'm gone.....
