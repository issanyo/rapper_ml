...and that's hi-jacking the incarnation process
The Council of Twelve, when the audit came through
They tried to use CERN, the Large Hadron Collider in France
To fudge the numbers...
That's the best best way I'll describe it
It was seen through
They were all ejected from the game
All of those people that were a part of that project
Were ejected
This goes for the Light too
Cuz the light was doing some pretty nasty things
At the time too

There are Light beings that are so far up the butt of light
They only see darkness
They're in to polarity so far
And there's no neutral side in between them
They're just battling to battle
Cuz they've battled for so long
And will win at any cost
And when you say "win at any cost"
You're not a light being anymore
You need to go heal
Go back to your source
And look at this from a different perspective
That includes the dark guys too...


[Verse: Ryney]
And then there was light
And then there was Light
Unfathomable shown through the illusion of night
And then there was light
What's the name of the game, girl?
Lightupaspliff
Yeah

Lightwork is the name of the game
With the Dark on the polar
Bare neutral sees through each play
And fans of Guru tell Mr. Youtube "FUCK SOLAAR!!"
And your soul traveled through the stargate
To meet the prize of being the sacred skin suit holder
Yeah Ryney spits bolder
My eye seeing is colder
The cold hard truth
Is so hot it straight smolder
Whether younger or older
There's no beginning or end
Battle between light and dark in this galaxy
Some are so far, far along in
And some stay away
A zealot is a zealot
No matter the hue the avatar play

This is a reminder of what Prime Creator say!
FREEDOM FOR ALL SENTIENT KIND!

Some individual I's are so closed
They are pinching it blind
So maybe the big bad dark ones
Should be thanked for their life
Maybe you're on the Graduating Timeline
Attach to Oneness
And cut the programs attached to your mind!

Light up a spliff!
The name of the game is lightworks!
Sharp with the hearts knife!
In summation
We are a nation
More than neutral, dark, and light!
Freedom's inside
Each line Of the rhyme!
