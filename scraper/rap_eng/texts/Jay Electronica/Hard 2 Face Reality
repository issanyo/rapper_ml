[Chorus: Poo Bear]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay away for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Tryna protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, woah, oh

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is for flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly the same, it's macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow
One day, you could be the king of pop
And the next one just be "Wacko" Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

[Bridge: Poo Bear]
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh, don't lose your self-esteem
I apologize, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
