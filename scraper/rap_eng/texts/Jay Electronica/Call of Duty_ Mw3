Feat. Mobb Deep
"Centuries ago, words were written to be a call
And a spur to the faithful servants of Truth and Justice:
Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valor
And be in readiness for the conflict;
For it is better for us to perish in battle
Than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altar
As the Will of God..." -- Winston Churchill

[Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, you know the story where real see real we recognize
When you see the steel flash, you petrifies
Steve Jobs seen death after just retiring
Takes vision to build, God bless the dead
That's Mac, that's Pac, that's Pun, that's B.I.G
Shit, niggas know the +Sunshine Eternal+/son shine eternal
I burn slow like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with yayo, uh
I went from MySpace to the top of the food chain
The sperm hit the eggs like a missile
Then nine months later, the celebratory news came
"Exhibit C" gave the whole world a mood change
Electronic, niggas call my album "Detox"
'cause they know I'm finna bring the next "Chronic"
Roc Nation, Cole World, it's a wrap, nigga
Put your diamonds in the sky, take that, nigga

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Yeah, put your diamonds in the sky
Wave 'em side to side, get juxed when you shine
As time go by, we live by an eye for an eye
I'll die for you, your drama is mine
Put your diamonds in the sky
Wave 'em side to side, get robbed â€˜fore you shine
As time go by, we live by an eye for an eye
I'll die for you, your beef is mines

[Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, to whom it may concern
If it's hate, wait yo' turn, dig a crate, make a urn
Please God, tell Flex drop a bomb on me
Tell the Minister to tattoo the Qur'an on me
Before the men in black try to pin a crime on me
And Rupert Murdoch and his goons get to lyin on me
...The Lord is my shepherd
So tell the royal family to order my records
And spread 'em cross Europe in a organized method
We could heal the planet with a organized effort
The Jews and the Christians and the Muslims and the Buddhists
And the Sikhs and Scientologists is all of my brethren
Play this on the radio
You never heard another nigga say this on the radio
We made it out the ghett-io
Brunch with the Rothschilds, dinner with the Carters
Jay Elect stop the press, criticalest artist
What the fuck~?!

[Chorus]
[Prodigy]
I done sat around for years daydreamin of this
Me and Jay biz, green gettin twist
Kids goin to school, we still on the bench
Early morning yawnin, no sleep, just this
Hardcore rhymin like a diamond when I spit
Come hell or high water, we gon' make it out the bricks
I done graduated gladiator school, what's next?
From the bottom, only one way to go to the tip
Of the top, with these nonstop flows I invent
Bars so hard, shit hurt when it hit
My bars like prison bars, I'm trapped in the pens
Of this wildstyle hip-hop' the fuckin strongest
Rappers on the earth, it's a curse and a gift
Black cloud follow my life, how worse could it get?
Respect, power, and money, in that exact order
I got it all, nigga, I'll break ya lil' neck

[Chorus]
