[Verse 1]
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called rulers, kings and presidents
Revolution is here, man, we're culturally wise
Elijah's pride, when I spit, I cause landslides
Rain, hail, snow and earthquakes break the states
George Bush lay and wait for the invasion date
We the quintessential soldiers, movin' in the Cobra
Cooler than the polar, elevate throughout the solar
System comes equipped with my lyrical staff
Pharaoh cast and I cast, free at last
Raise it in the green pastures, I can't lose
Wack rappers couldn't walk a fuckin' mile in my shoes
I carry my cross, been shot, burned, stabbed and hung
You's a jack of all trades but you mastered none
I mastered one, rap, that's it
Spit that hot shit, that's it, holla back, that's it

[Hook]
Now man up, man up
Go 'head, man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When this shit gets rough, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up
Man up,  we man up, that's right
Man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When the shit hits the fan, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up

[Verse 2]
Meet Christ the Crusher, there ain't no stoppin' the king
Baby Paul, right now I'm on top of my game
I wreck cassette decks, blow spots like Waco, Texas
I might possess flesh but I'm ethereal, baby
And I drink by myself, think by myself
But when it's time for war, goddamn we man up
Then we give to you raw, shit, man, we clan up
Afghanian style, fam, we stand up
Get it crackalackin', I cut MCs so quick
Blood from their necks be drippin', but they be still rappin'
I'm razorblade sharp, darts, I throw 'em
Jay Electronica spittin' them awesome poems
Stand to you man, animals up to a perpendicular pose
I hit your clique with the potion 'til you froze
32 degrees, you can't breathe
Believe, all will lie Gs, but man up

[Hook]
Now man up, man up
Go 'head, man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When this shit gets rough, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up
Man up,  we man up, that's right
Man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When the shit hits the fan, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
These cats'll split your wig in the name of beef
But when the cops come they're runnin' and tossin' their heat
Is you a thug or a coward? It's time to rebel
If I don't get Jill by June, you gon' find me in jail
Rap is the ultimate weapon, we run the globe
I'm glad the God's Son beef is finally done with, Hov
Benzino on the battle with Em
But George Bush is fuckin' up the whole country, stupid, battle with him

[Hook]
Now man up, man up
Go 'head, man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When this shit gets rough, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up
Man up,  we man up, that's right
Man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When the shit hits the fan, goddamn we man up
We man up, that's right, we man up
