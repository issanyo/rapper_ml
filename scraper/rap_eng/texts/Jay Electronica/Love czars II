[Verse 1 Jay Electronica]

Heavens to Murgatroyd
Who drop a bomb and roll out like Metroid
The Jedi master without a droid, Lounging in the void
You'll be talking shit when my ships deployed
From Ferett street to Connecticut
Niggas got they money on slim to spit the realest shit he ever spit
That cream vanilla folder in the limo with the president
That never say never whatever nigga rhetoric, Panoramic
Close-captioned, Fade to black, lights cameras action
Michael Jackson crying
Tears, sniffin' lines
Paramount declared it the movie of all times
The wolves stood in line twelve days to see blood
The ghost of Malcolm X came straight with the judge
Six-million Youtube views in six hours
The devil threw a hissy fit and blew down the towers
That's power
The I-M-F, Federal Reserve
Can't stop my Myspace from spreadin' the word
No record deal just hard ass rhymes
Turned poverty and heartache to nickels and dimes
I'm on fire like the pentagon hexes on the hecklers
Another rapper to me is a deathwish on the necklace
My shotgun go click-clack blast
I'm on a forty day fast, No cheese no grass
Linked up with Fiq and Taz and talk math
Now I`m free at last nigga free at last

[Outro]

The L's coming, listen up, I'm tryna tell you something
