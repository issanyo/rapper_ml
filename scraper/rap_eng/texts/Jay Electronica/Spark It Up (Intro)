Fresh out the gate its the Asiatic
Fanatic back at it
Spitting black magic
Create a world outta black fabric
Sparkled the life
Spark it with light
God stay visible
My du-rag create sound waves I'm Jay Pivotal
Spun the cypher running with Christ plus I'm a sniper
One with the dice one with the mics and nobody's nicer
I payed the price-ah
And now I'm heating up the rostrum
Sucker emcees get struck to they knees playing possum
Rap gods insane
Lyrical Messiah, Jesus baptized in a flame
Sanitize they brain
What's the origin
Ten thousand sons up in my squadron
We break down then build back up to form an organ
The flows natural
The inner-glow is celestial
The physical mold that's just the clothes for the astral
Extra-terrestrial
Emceeing supreme being
All eyes seeing
Master the seen and unseen
And what year was that when the atom was cracked
In the materials of darkness she laid on her back
She knows all about you
Because the womb of the mind is the wo-man
That x chromosome came up out you
My rhymes like sperm cells thoughts for tales
Reproduce like sperm whales sharks and snails
Hit your gray matter
Then they excrete the data
And gestate for nine months above the bladder
This the most mathematical style that you heard of
And every verse I spit bitch it kicks murder
And like Roberta Flack
I'm killing you soft
Drawing you up in the fire midst revealing your thoughts
When Allah and his Christ bust through the ceiling with hawks
In the face of the earth meet the tip of the drills with a spark
That's the judgement
Its grievous man
This population face to face with this Jesus man
Came to his own but they mis-perceived the lamb
Four-hundred years of slaving for the seeds of Abraham
