She said "Jay I'm yours
I've been screaming for the past three days I'm hoarse,"
She was spinning like she'd never seen waves before
So I gave her a boat, and an oar
And a star to guide her safely to the shore
She said she'd never believe in Moses and Noah
Unless I show her, so I showed her
Gave it right to her like I owed her
That's when I changed from Shrek the ogre
Into Master Yoda
She said "oh I, can't believe uh, it's a miracle
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a spherical
Object, hard to detect, right out the projects
He can move mountains without flexing a bicep,"
Speaking strange dialect, I start dropping jewellery
Her eyes went googly, she went home and Googled me
Myspace friend requested and Youtubed me
A hundred thousand views of me
Buildin' me a manor on the backs of wack rappers
Out here spitting that foolery
She logged on to Gmail, clicked compose
And said "I don't do this usually
Nas said Hip Hop was dead
And what these niggas out here spitting is just eulogy
You represent the new to me, true, cats is nice
But I ain't see the God since Hova spit that navy blue to me
Truly yours, don't let me down like Lennon
The greats pay the sacrifice in they early beginnings
P.S., 'LL' rocked the bells, now it's your time
Your train is running on schedule, 'LOL', showtime
I hear your name ringing, I feel the game changing
Niggas know, every time you spit
It's like Rakim in his flag
Spitting flames with his chain dangling
Barack Obama with his dame way out in Maine wrangling
The game will swallow you if you ain't strong enough to make it follow you
I'd pack my bags and head home if I was you"
