What we call individual is really just a collage
A by product of God or the wizard of oz
A seed out of the sod which was planted by W.o.Z
Beings to bring about a thing whether evil or clean remains to be seen
So never trust a disguise, the wise weight the intentions
Then they scan the horizon for divine intervention
When they see it they record it the prophets read it and call it revelation
The preacher then sings to the congregation, slaves go back to work and they sing from the plantations
Blacks versus Caucasians, Dominicans versus Haitians
The Serbs will launch a nuclear attack against the Croatians
Christians saying revelations is being fulfilled, Satan is being killed
Debating the pros and the cons of the war with Iran, the war with Pakistan
The bombs, its just tragic, mmm mm its just magic, mmm its just magic
