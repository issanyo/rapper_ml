[Verse - Jay Electronica]
There's more than one way to heal a leper
Terrorize the commercialized Thrill the hecklers
You might be eatin' off that wack shit for now
But I interrupt dinner like bill collectors
Hit the lights, cue music, run the real projectors
I was raised on Kool-Aid and Pac-Man
Steely Dan, Gap Band, Michael Jackson
Outside, the fiends was scufflin' for crack
In the same spots where shell-toes was doin' back spins
That's why I spit the otherful, colorful, you a fly motherfucker
You bubble you B.L.O.W
Vision like the Hubble, the trouble
From Lancaster to Manchester, I slam rappers
And keep weak niggas in line like band captains
