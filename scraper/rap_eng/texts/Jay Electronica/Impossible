Verse
How did you do this to me that's impossible
And how did you break my heart
I don't know why did I stand here in the rain it's because
Of you whenever you lose me I've already
Missed you so much you never talked and walk
Bridge
Do you know who am I it's impossible to forget
My name and my face do you know
How it hurts my feelings that you break my heart into
Small pieces like a puzzle
Chorus
The possible way to love there is something wrong
With you it's too impossible to leave me
In the rain after I cried out loud in the pain of my
Heart
Verse
I will be forever young no one can steal
My heart rather than you
But it's impossible to break my heart into pieces
Like a cake
Bridge
Nobody can get the possible way and the
Impossible that could ever stay with
Me as one big family
Chorus
I never thought you were angry to me but it's
Fine to me and you will be
Mine forever but now it's to late for me because
You got someone else to love you
Verse
Don't think so do I really need to apologize first
Before you go or not
Why don't like me right but it's time to go
So never fall in love again in impossible
Way
Bridge
Don't know why what's wrong with you
Are you happy because I am going to leave now
Okay then now forget it
Chorus
So what if I die today are you going to missed me
Or not but it's impossible to let you go
Don't forget my promised to you and never forget
To be good
