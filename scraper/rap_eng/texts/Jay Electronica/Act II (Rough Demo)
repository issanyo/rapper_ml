[Intro]
The GM sector is very, very powerful, they're very good at generating press releases. They've been making wild promises, curing the blind, turning deserts into whatever it sees them, and growing crops without water and sun for many, many years. The reality is that almost all of their research has gone into finding mechanisms, ways of allowing them to consolidate their control over the future and that is what it's about, it's very hard to argue that. As a result of their incredible power they have managed to, in my view, compromise possibly even corrupt the regulating system and the effect is that the market is racing ahead of the science and that's the reason advancements have not become...

[Hook]
We keep our pistols blazin'
Hot like Cajun
Hotter than even holdin' work at the Days Inn
That's the reason he's so amazin'

[Verse 1]
Who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras
'Til the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, we saving the blind
I was raised by America
Had a baby with Erykah
Niggas started expecting the God to dress funny
Although, I'm fresher than a mannequin
Under pressure like Anakin
Grandma ain't ever raise a test dummy
So if life is a bitch
I'm slow dancing a song off
Romancing her thong off and taking her with me
I'mma tell ya like Rick Rozay the boss
[...]
I seen all your magic tricks, Abracadabraless
My crowd gather around; it's the resurrection of Lazarus
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
[...] for a Hilfiger
I never went to prom, was in a different mind
Just was in a different time than everybody else was
Not cause I ain't felt love
Even though we ain't had food all the time, we had clothing and shelter
House full of flowers, but I was the only Thedford
I remember my dad, but I was always a stepson
You know how the story go
My momma always say, "to God be the glory though"
I kept it movin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nervous when they see the black man walking down the street, boppin'
Hold your head and keep rockin'
Pants sag, fuck a cop swag, keep Pac'n
It's a new world doctrine, oppression is not an option
If Sean John and Ciroc in stock, then keep shopping
What little faith you had in Barack, leave stock in
Whether good or bad
The world need to see the black man push a 'Lac down Pennsylvania Ave
Neither a Caesar or Ming remains
'Cuz dissatisfied humanity screams for change
And so it happens
Why you think the god started rappin'?
