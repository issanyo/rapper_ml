[Verse 1]
You look pretty today baby what you smiling at this time
You got a nigga hooked like salmon on the fishline
Smell like baby powder, strawberries, and cream
The candy man from New Orleans would like to dip you in the stream
Her rear view is panoramic
Let me hold your hand take you to my planet
Throw on some Atlantic
Starr, sippin on some glasses
Sit back relax watch time roll past ya
Now you caught up in the rapture
You better check the NASA, I'm out of this world
My dissertations be stumbling blocks with scholars at Yale
I had a double shot of Jack Daniels, no rocks with lemon
She said she couldn't trust me cause I know lots of women
"Plus, you might be too much with your alpha male syndrome"
Girl you something else with your caramel skintone
That Gucci got you feelin extra sassy
That Alexander McQueen is classy
How the hell you get pass me?

[Hook]
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
Never thought I'd

[Verse 2]
Well... I guess that's yesterdays mixup
Now blast that Act II real loud and twist the spliff up
We broke bread, she let me taste her lips just a lickle bit
"You the type of nigga I imagine puffin nickels with
You the type of figure that they pattering the scriptures with"
Jay the most treacherous set banger
Electric neck wrangler
JVC stereo cassette mangler
Flyer than a jet
But lowkey'er than a jet hangar
Take 2 of these and text me
Your rainbow nails impress me
You kinda sexy
She said "Jay I'm yours
I've been screaming for the past three days I'm hoarse,"
She was spinning like she'd never seen waves before
So I gave her a boat, and an oar
And a star to guide her safely to the shore
She said she'd never believe in Moses and Noah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So I showed her
Gave it right to her like I owed her
That's when I changed from Shrek the ogre
Into Master Yoda
She said "oh I, can't believe uh, it's a miracle
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a spherical
Object, hard to detect, right out the projects
He can move mountains without flexing a bicep,"
Speaking strange dialect, I start dropping jewellery
Her eyes went googly, she went home and Googled me
Myspace friend requested and Youtubed me
A hundred thousand views of me
Buildin' me a manor on the backs of wack rappers
Out here spitting that foolery
Logged on to Gmail, clicked compose
And said "I don't do this usually
Nas said Hip Hop was dead
And what these niggas out here spitting is just eulogy
You represent the new to me, true, cats is nice
But I ain't see the God since Hova spit that navy blue to me
Truly yours

[Hook]
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
Never thought I'd feel this way
I'm losing shape and out of face
Never thought I'd feel this way
And it's with you
