Question
How does one go from chosen to posin'
Trapped in a box for years, like Han Solo frozen
Trapped in a wack idea designed by De Beers
To keep your mental eyelids closed and your eyeballs bulgin'
Fear, it could kill a man
Turn a real man to a realer man

Don't let the green grass across the picket fence
Turn you into Mr. Smith without a purpose or a home
Underneath he is a Jedi on the surface, he's a Clone
Smilin' for his peers but
At night time he cried til he dried up all his tear ducts
And he cool with that as long as he got a haircut and his gear up
Without change we over
From individuals to posers
