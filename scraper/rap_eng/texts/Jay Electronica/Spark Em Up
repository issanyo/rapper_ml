Fresh out the gate it's the asiatic
Fanatic back at it
Spittin black magic
Create a world outta black fabric
Spark with the light
Spark it with life
God stay visible
My du rag create sound waves I'm jay pivotal
Spun the cipher running with christ plus I'm a sniper one with the dice one with the mics and nobodys nicer
I payed the price-ah
And now I'm heatin up the rostrum
Sucka mcs get struck to they knees playin possum
Rap guys insane
Lyrical messiah, jesus baptize in the flame
Sanitize they brain
What's the origin
Ten thousand sons up in my squadron
We break down and build back up to form a organ
The flows natural
The interglow is celestial
The physical mold that's just the clothes for the astral, extra terrestial
Emceeing supreme bein
All eyes seein
Mastered the seen and unseen
And what year was that when the atom was cracked
In the materials of darkness she laid on her back
Shes knows all about you
Cause the womb of the mind is the one man
That x chromosome came up out you
My rhymes like sperm cells thoughts for tales
Reproduce like sperm whales sharks and snails
Hit your gray matter
Then they excrete the data
And just stay for 9 months above the bladder
This the most mathe-matical
Style that you've heard of
And every verse I spit bitch it kicks murder
And like roberta flack
I'm killin you soft
Drawin you up in the fire midst revealing your thoughts
When allah and his christ bust thru the ceilin with hawks
In the face of the earth meet the tip of the drills with a spark
That's the judgement
It's grievous man
This population face to face with this jesus man
Came to his own but they mispercieved the lamb
400 years of slavin for the seeds of abraham
