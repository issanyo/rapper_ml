[Verse 1]
I'm back, you know the sun gon' shine
Allah saw what I needed and blessed me with it
A real thorough woman with a zesty spirit
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Yo, I really love you more than you seem to know
Far from mediocre, glad I seen the glow
A vanguard with a mission give me piece of mind
I don't need to roam around in the streets for mine
Perfection, that's something we gon' reach with time
Parlay in range rover seats reclined
Sometimes you make me mad but I learn to get over it
It's the first time I had struggles I had to be sober with
Islam cleaned me up but you the finishing touches
Came a long way from nickelback, Guinness and duchess
I love you like a mother, a sister and a wife
You gave the great gift of all love
I give you my life

[Hook]
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land

[Verse 2]
See word is bond, bond is life
X and Y, man and wife
We can make the solar system
Knowledge to control the wisdom
You're such a beautiful person, one of the only reasons the sun shines and so the Earth spins
I spit wisdom, she got ??? off my words
The slangs and slurs the ??? and the fly proverbs
Yo my mind detect that shit was ready I reflect
So I struck her with the sunshine made her spin one time
She love me I love her back, it's actually facts
Let's count stacks turn out parents to grand-parents
We could travel the seas and spark plus degrees
I spread love cause lust is just disease
Let me bless with good home and luxuries
You can have anything if you just believe
You can have everything if you just believe
You can have whatever you want, just believe

[Hook]
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land

[Verse 3]
Yo, you can have my last name if you master the pain
We can fast, we can pray, we can master the rain
We can cry, we can laugh, we can master the brain
We can give birth to God and leave this plane
Yous an angel, I wonder how you hide those wings
I used to see you in my dreams fly marvelous queen
Allah's daughter, your eyes sparkle just like quater
You can be my Earth and you can be my water

[Hook]
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Hey love, I got plans we can build together
We can conquer these oceans and hills together
That's life, I can't grow being half a man
See I need that other chromosome to master the land
