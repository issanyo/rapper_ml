[Verse 1: Trippy Tyler
Tell em all at the opera, they ought'a watch for the phantom of chakras
Mandible cannon that'll, blow all your thoughts up, cannabis chopped up, five feet of smoke its your lugs that you cough up
Young Frank Sinatra, but no Logic, if you throw yours I'll harm it, carnivore it, rip apart shit
Take caution when you rock this, might get your feeling hurt just like my moms did when
I told her I got kicked out of school waiting for her comment, was like waiting for a world ending comet, fuck
See, Lyrically I'm fit, spiritually I be lit of this shit that I'm, Chiefin' like and Indian
Watching these critics in my peripheral vision I envision them in collisions with black holes to throw em in other dimensions
So much smoke in the room its out of commission, my mission is gettin' people to listen, when I'm transmittin' my lyrics they just, stiffin' up like the work of morticians
So don't, pay attention the shit I'm spittin' is hella different, this pen is vicious Charles Manson composition
My verses like ear prescriptions, you heard it then were addicted I'm swervin' at birds I'm so lifted
I promise this shit ain't never endin' its just, repeatin' beginnin's

[Verse 2: Illuminatic]
Fuck, that, shit
You see
Y'all want original, unidentical
I want subliminal, picture the pinnacle penmanship in this indigo individual
Most want to reject me, few want to respect me, probably cause the color of my skin needs second checking
You're a solid wall and I'm the fucking ball for wrecking, spit what I want nigga fuck what y'all expecting
Voices in the head damn nexus still ain't resting, probably my conscious testing my mind to keep things interesting
My words are undigesting, but I need to keep peace with these demons I'm erecting
Spit more fucking truth than the man you're re-electing, never gave a fuck to wonder what the rest are thinking
3rd eye open and the fucker never blinking
Fuck you and your, ignorant way of thinking
