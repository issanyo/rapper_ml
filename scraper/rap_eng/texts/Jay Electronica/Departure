As the tears welled up in my eyes
My mama said "Son what happened?"
"Sometimes I can't breathe cause it's so much crap man
I called on God but he don't call back and
Fight to stay sane while the devil's laughin'
Last night I was across the tracks
With Freddy and Black Teddy just playin' a crap game
Smokin' on stank, sippin' on drank
When Brian came flyin up the block like batman
'*pant pant* Minnie got killed!
His wig got peeled in the Calliope
By some Tenth Ward niggas that we barely know!'
I said 'Hold up, whoa whoa whoa whoa
You must be jokin',' but he wasn't laughin'
Freddy passed out in the the grass and that's when
His mother came outside and said 'Where's Minnie?'
I looked down at the ground 'I don't know where he's at ma'am.'
Lump in my throat; I just lost my best friend
Connecticut Minnie with the East Coast accent
Top it all of, my older cousin Mookie got caught
With some yellow capped vials of crack, man
"It's time for me to leave home, Ma; that's that, man
It ain't much left here to see for a black man"
I'mma spread my wings, pursue this rap thing
Kiss my baby sister, tell her I'll be back
I'm on I-10 East bound to Manhattan
NYC. Yes, sir, that's rap land
A one way ticket, a trunk of clothes
I spent my last 25 cent on Pac-Man
Mister bus driver set me free;
Just take me to New York and let me be
