Gucci Prada and Vera Wang
Won't help to rebuild a city after a hurricane
Your house and your spouse
Your two car garage, the spinners under the range
Lead a nigga to believe he mastered the game
And if you don't have any of the above said material goods than you inferior
Chickens say your lame
So niggas go rob a liquor store to get em a chain
Shoot up a house party for nothin' to get em a name
Like convict, dope-man, oh that's them niggas
And if you think they're really happy go and ask them niggas
I promise you they lie
Position they fingers to throw they hood up in the sky
To tell you man look I
Know what I'm doin' is wrong but how can I survive
And when they hear songs like this to get by they cry
For a split second
Then its back the snappin' they fingers to that hit record
Let's meditate for a second
