I said "I love you baby," "Well you ain't act like it;
Squeeze my feet, kiss my neck, rub my back like it"
And on the phone it's just "'You gon hit me back right quick?'
First we was straight now it feel like we jack-knifin'"
Kamikaze love, self-destructive patterns
Mercury in retrograde, four house of Saturn
Nothing makes me sadder than
Hailing cabs alone goin home on a Saturday
Bumpin' Donny Hathaway, questioning my choices
Thinkin 'bout marriage, carriage, and horses
Manor on a hectare of land like a fortress
I hope you understand me
Yo, I'm cold like New York, my heart is warm like Miami
I'm just trying to build a Kingdom for my people and my Family
Sometimes I don't know what to say
The pain never stops, the cloud never goes away
The rain never drops
It's a luxury
Be grateful that a mustard seed of faith is enough to be
Enough to move a mountain
My pen is an artery, my heart is a fountain
I apologize
