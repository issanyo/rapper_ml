[Verse 1]
Jay electrolysis probin the globe like a geologist
Puttin all of you pussies on display like gynocologists
Listen, I'm on a mission, most of you niggas just spittin'
The wise comprehend the diction, hypnotized with the rhythm
Lyrical circumcision; toss the schmuck in the fire
Yeah your mans and them is nice but they ain't fuckin with 'siah
I'm a higher power devour all you idolaters
You satan worshippers, nation perverters thirstin' for dollars
Jay coldplay putting the clock on your chess game
I'm a varsity letterman, you a fresh-mayne
Every line of every verse of every song is a quotable
Catch me in Mexico meditating with Quetzalcoatl fuckers
I'm rainin fire on you lame suckers
My tongue is the burner the barrel the biscuit don't make me buck it spratt
I'm outta that Mac I came into rap carrying the south on my back
And I'm ready to scriddap
It ain't where you from son it's where you live at
I never kiss another niggas bum to get me did-dap
I used to sip the coke and rum blowin dime sid-dacks
But now I'm wagin war with wicked men in high places
So what you sayin

[Verse 2]
Every page of my poetry's like a rhyme from the clip
The mic is always in my holster right on top of my hip
Niggas get flipped
When the hollowtip spit at they melons
You niggas is Missy misdemeanor my niggas is felons holla
Me and Big Dame Lord of the Rings the Twins Towers
Knockin other motherfuckers out the ring like Apollo Creed
You wanna get bleed the blood run up
And get done up until sunup
Down south they call me white man cause I hang MC's
Get em open with ease
Then pick em off like fleas nigga please
You ain't go no wins in mi casa
Que pasa
My flow'll fuckin swole ya bumba rasta
Loch ness monster
It's like RAAAAAA when I strike ya
Suplexin niggas like Rowdy Rod Piper
John Allen Muhammad snipe ya
It's a cost to be the boss and I paid the price-ah
Nobodies nicer
I'm cold as the north pole; nobodies icer
Shout outs to Mr. Porter, D-Twizzy, and Obie Tricer
Shady, you can catch me in the D now baby it's all gravy
Still reppin UPT what is you sayin'

Ali, Saddiq
We 'bout to spit fire on these motherfuckers for one thousand two hundred and sixty days

[Verse 3]
I'm trapped in the game like Pacmayne chasin' the ghost
Drownin with water in my throat got leaks in the boat
Squeezin the toast
It's not a op-tion I got Pac on, Makaveli the Don
Bumpin' that "Me And My Glock" song, zonin'
Like Robert Dinero with Ronin
Struck 'em up with the omen
From adolescents to grown men
Walk a mile in my shoes; it proves you a soldier
I paid a lot of dues to prove to Jehovah
That I can carry the cross, the castle, the crown
Everywhere I roam is home; life's my battleground
Sallhuddin Abdul Fard Muhammad
The come up at by night, ridin' Elijah the comet (uh)
I caved chest in the brave chessman
Masterin' one twenty lessons is my profession
So get to steppin'
Or catch lead like Zeppelin
These rap cats look real but they really not, like wrestlin'
Check the solar commander
I'm light years off of the scanner
Satillite dishes and cameras a bad mamma jamma
The most thorough examiner
My microphone is seven thousand nine-hundred and twenty six miles in diameter
The Son of Man
Son of Teman from Mount Puran
Master the air in the land from here to Iran
Jay Electronica revolve the world
Them Philly cats say I like that bol he raw but he thorough
What you sayin'
