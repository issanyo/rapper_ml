She said she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is a portal
To the true nature of growth to the Christ like Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house and a home
A chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work; go to church let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the close minded in the sit-ins
And clothes lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Benz
And get Punked on TV by my friends
Don't get a nigga wrong, I get tempted by the rewards
That all come along with nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
F*ck that, f*ck rap this God-hop
King-dom mu-sic for the hard rocks
I'm a spit it till TRL get it and Hot97 hear the nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Who Kidd
Just blaze said Jay is the new kid
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook just new shit
The handling of a heart's
A very delicate art
Cause it's paper thin
One irrelevant thought
That started out as a spark
Could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark
That's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee what a place I'm in
Lead me to the sta-tio-n
A one way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that frozen crack
A whole lotta pain I'm holdin' back
Sheriff said: "Eff that, roll the sack"
I said: "If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at"
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Hold her hand stop starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back
Wheres the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling
I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol wheres the track
Ring no answer came home late
Jane told dick she had a date
But they was just chillin'
And at that moment the right brain says to the left just kill em
Make the headlines
Make the front page
Wild out in the court house man thrill em
They'll say: "The boy dead wrong but I feel 'I'm"
Voodoo man, chicken bone chicken bone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing
My nose get bloody
I feel a little bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission
Put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The Christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind woke up in front of a mic stand
Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The blueprints for a disc shaped-like vessel
That was chiseled out of metal off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain I went to Tepoztl√°n
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap slumber man
Voodoo man, civilize the savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorize the cleric
For carrying on nonsense
Specialized lies to paralyze the conscience
Voodoo man, chit chatter
Abracadabra, spitting out matter
While I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew 'em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pellegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah
Purify ya take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the high-est buyer
Now you're on the wire
Talking about two-foot tires
Saying you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar pants on fire
Same old rugged cross
Different crucified messiah
While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was openin' they files
On the UFO phenomenon: I.e. spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack may as well face it
Every rhyme I write the seal get cracked in the chapter of Revelations
An atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit, call me Jay Dogon I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder why don't he bust
Allah blessed me with a Midas-y touch
Everything I lay the hands turn to Ethiopian gold: shiny and buffed
I got a firm understandin' on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper
Bout how he ain't got rhymes
That's f*ckin' with mine's
I'm trying to kill Lucifer, so if I have to brake
Cause a rapper in my face
Tellin' me that he the great
You can bet a shiny nickel
I'll blast his motherf*ckin' ass way past Jupiter
You couldn't be stupider
F*ckin' with the nuc-u-lear
Mayan, Aztec lion
Asiatic Blackman from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltriptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass, blunts and cash
We need savin'
Minds are consumed with swine we need bathin'
