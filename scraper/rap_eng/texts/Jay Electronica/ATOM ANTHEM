[Verse 1: D Prosper]
Jedi Knight shit right here
D Prosper and Jay Elect
All Hail the Rap Gods
Better show respect
We on deck
Do the damn thing
Shining like the gold pendants
Descendants of Black Kings
You know the flow
Is cold as ice
So I beat ‘em in the head with that
"Tumbling Dice"
The Gods back
Matter fact I’m the Oracle
Big Up Just Blaze
Mike Chav, Johnny Audible
TJ on the wheels
Sadiq on the camera
“Too Legit To Quit”
Unh!
Hit them with the Hammer!!
Internet thug
Put a block on you spammers
Really no question
You know who the man is
Son on that Sun Ra
Sun Tzu
Burn like the sun do
Mic check
One two
Respect when I come thru
Move like royalty
Selassie I the majesty
Brightest of the hundred billion
Stars in the galaxy

I spit venom
Haters sour like Lemons
Entering the new dimension
Through the wormhole in Yemen
Blow the spot
Like the embassy bombing
The master shaman
Rock the Golden Death Mask
Like I’m Tutankhamun
IIm in a hybrid hooptie...
Shades on, Kufi
Notice that we focused man
Disciplined like Bruce Lee
Damn right!
Hold tight!
Black fist
Dark night
Real revolutionary rap
This the prototype
First on Earth
Don’t interrupt
Yeah homie that's what's up
DNA origins
Black Queen tell a friend
Lucy?
3 million years on the skeleton
Now your just scared
And trembling
See me in the club
Getting more love than Wimbledon!
I'm planet Earths best
Man fuck what you heard
Reptilians still running
This shit is absurd!

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
I need money; I used to be a stick up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
And all of the mischievous things I hid
Should of died at 19, never seen my kid
A slave to nicotine, whiskey shots, anonymous
The rear view shows no one there reminding us
No Ramadan, Qur'an, Hanukkah, yarmulke
Could save me the way that the DJ did (Unh)
Jay Velour fidor (?) fedora, tweed Diadoras
No church no holy water no pew no mask de la hoya
I leave the arena the way I came
Gold medals rose petals, waving my cane
The party people all say my name
Black god body
Civilize a 85er right there in the lobby
From JFK to Hobby
How does he do it
Its kinda like this
Every rhyme I write is like a flying disk
I drop bombs like a scientist
I drop bombs like a scientist
Jay Elec get stronger as I get older
I measure with the heat that's made by solar
I represent the UPT Magnolia
Tin man floating in my tin can
Major Tom to ground control
My resume fucks up the sound control
My melody fucks up the mind control
