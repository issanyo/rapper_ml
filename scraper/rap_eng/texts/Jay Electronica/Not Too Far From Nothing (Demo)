[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
There's more than one way to heal a leper
Terrorize the commercialized thrill the hecklers
You might be eatin' off that wack shit for now
But I interrupt dinner like bill collectors
Hit the lights, cue music, run the real projectors
I was raised on kool-aid and Pac-Man
Steely Dan, Gap Band, Michael Jackson
Outside, the fiends was scufflin' for crack
In the same spots where shell-toes was doin' backspins
That's why I spit the otherful, colorful
You a fly motherfucker, you bubble you B.L.O.W
Vision like the Hubble, the trouble
From Lancaster to Manchester, I slam rappers
And keep weak niggas in line like band captains

[Verse 2: Tron]
Reporting live from the planet Earth, paper and scissor
Thrive in the dirt taking what belong to Caesar
He's a, lyrical messiah, run!
In the reign of the Clus
We torn and abuse ourselves
Son of gun confuse and misuse by the corporate truce
Go figure!
No excuse I fight for the user, Tron
Return of the son, Jay Electron gotcha!
The Turn coming soon aka whenever, magic
Wisdom so clear and melodic, sleek
Fingers go snap "oh man"
When they hear the padawan spit his flow, like damn
Cause when, they try to take a bite they'll learn
You can't touch this like "Swiper no swiping" amen
