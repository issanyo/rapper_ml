I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan sweatin all through the night just like the holy prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with Jay Cole and Kweli
Just before Jay-Hova The God crowned me the King with his Golden locket
AlhamdulillƒÅh, We've come really far, ain't it?
The little engine who could, can power any car, can't it?
The Mothers in Chiraq said the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times, the Holy Quran and bible we on the last page and line
The verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the Matrix, outside of the spaceship
But the saviour's blind
Or so it seems
Years after Noah was told he would row a stream
The heavens bursteth then the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who work the chain gangs
I hit that Shmoney Dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state has spreaded to the backstreet and to the driveways
Officer Friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the Asiatic Ancient Semitic Peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple
