She said "Jay I'm yours
I've been screamin for the past 3 days, I'm hoarse! "
She was spinnin like she ain't never seen waves before
So I gave her a boat, and an oar, and a star to ride
Safely to the shore
She said she never believed in Moses and Lore
Unless I showed her. So I showed her
Gave it right to her like I owed her
That's when I changed from Shrek the Ogre into Master Yoda
She said "Oh I, can't believe it, it's a miracle! "
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a spherical object
Hovering hi-tech right out the projects
He can move mountains without flexin his bi-cepts
He speak a strange dialect
I start droppin jewelry
Her eyes went googly, she went home and Google'd me
MySpace, Friend Requested and YouTubed me
A hundred thousand views of me
Buildin me a castle on the backs of wack rappers out here, spittin that foolery
She logged onto G-Mail, clicked Compose and said
"I don't do this usually
Nas said Hip-Hop is dead and what these other niggas spittin is just Eulogy
You represent the truth in me, true
Cats is nice but I ain't seen the god since Hova spit that baby blue to me
Truely yours, don't let me down like Lennon
The greatest paid they sacrifices in they early beginnins
P.S. LL Rocked the Bell, now it's yo time
Your train's runnin off schedule, LOL Showtime
I hear your name ringin, I feel the game changin
Niggas know, every rhyme you spit
Is like Rakim in his flags
Spittin flames with his chain danglin
Barack Obama with his dame way out in Maine wranglin
The game'll swallow you if you ain't strong enough to make it follow you
I'd pack my bags and head home if I was you."
So salute to the most honorable
MC, Abombinable
Jay Electronica
