I really wanna take you home
Make you feel so good
So why you sittin' there all alone
When you look so good
Don't you play hard to get with me (no no no no)
I ain't for your games baby soon you'll see
Do we gotta play so hard to get

[Jay Electronica]
Hey miss lady it's Uptown Slim
Him
Who be hangin' on the corner with them
Nevertheless
You lookin' good in that Anthropologie dress
I might say yes but
You gotta realize you fuckin' with the best boo
I'm never ever stressed man
Everywhere I rest
I get treated like a king, I'm the sire here
You can see it in the stars the messiah's here
You can read it in them cards, the fire's here
Now, what's your name
So I can tell you who you are and why you came
That feel good don't it?
I can do you real good put the hood on it
Now take that home and blow a bag a good on it
Google my name then e-me in the morning
I'm Jay Electronica the black Adam
Settin' shit on fire like a cracked atom
Get at 'em, feel me

[Hook]

Inventory let's see hmm
Pretty skin pretty eyes
Itty bitty waist, pretty face, pretty thighs
I can take you to space and it's ok if you heart rate start racin' the stakes is pretty high
I normally don't chase but hey
It's really nice
To come out of the castle every once or twice, yeah
To have a shake and a roll of the dice g'yeah
Deuce fever, still got it
I control the dance floor slow is just logic
You fuckin' with a pro-fession-al it's obvious
Tell me what you do for your skin it's gorgeous
Pretty mannequin in the Gucci dress modeling
I'm a sovereign with lamp hattins in Manhattan
Lookin for a queen to get involved with
If it ain't broke then don't bother it
Call it what you wanna call it, just don't stall it
Feel me
