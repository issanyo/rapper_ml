[Hook]
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say

[Verse 1]
I was born on Tatooine with dreams of sand, I kept going
The blind would undermine my plans, I kept growing
God bless the child that has, I kept building
One can't rewind the past, I push forward
The pain was too much to bear, I kept hurting
Nobody could feel me there, I kept quiet
The tears would begin to well, I just fought em
They say you gotta pay your dues, I just bought em
What they don't know won't hurt em'
I pledge to never be no one's burden
Mama said never disrespect your neighbors
Cause next week, we might have to check for favors
That's science, I could never thank her for it
And 20/20 hindsight is so euphoric
Keep shining, nobody could stop your progress
Because unknown forces move some known objects
That's magic

[Hook]
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say

[Verse 2]
The long road home, the crown, the throne, I kept searching
Made time to find my own, I kept asking
Never ever strayed my course, I kept passion
Tried to reconnect my force, I kept fasting
Felt something inside my soul, I kept reaching
And even though that verse got old, I kept preaching
Even when the mosque got cold, we kept teaching
Selling Final Calls on Broad and Allegheny
Cause who gon save them babies?
And finally put a definite into all those maybes
A scholar and a gentleman to all those ladies
The haters and the naysayers say ya'll so crazy
That's physics, a necessary part of the story
And 20/20 hindsight is so euphoric
Keep shining, nobody could stop your progress
Because unknown forces move some known objects
That's magic

[Hook]
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say
