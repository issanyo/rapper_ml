[Verse One: Naledge]
Naledge your idol, The highest title, numero uno
Speakin' from my mind and I'm spittin' so that you know
I got a gift on the microphone
A blessin' up from Heaven to enlight your dome
Synonymous, unique and complete
Put the world at my feet through the words that I speak
Double O track the beat, we clockin' doe
Pissy drunk at Star Shoes and we poppin' Mo'
Need at least 10 stacks before we start the show
And at least 5 mo' befo' we out the do'
Don't understand? Well that's 15 flat
No need to worry, Matty M handles that
D solo make sure my rider is straight
Shrimp fried rice and Mongolian steak
Long neck Corona and my aura is great
Arturo Gatti style, takin' shots to the face
Patron tequila while I'm vibin' to Anita
Baker, Rapture album while it's bumpin' through my speaker
New millennium style, a child of the 80's
Soul of the 70's and rebel like the 60's
Argyle Lacoste and Air Force crispy
Cut, clean as a whistle, spinnin' 360
Used to dream of hittin' them homers at Wrigley
Rap star, Believe It Or Not just like Ripley

[Hook: Naledge]
Cool...relax
C'mon just vibe with me
As I take you on a lyrical odyssey

[Jay Electronica]
I say cool...relax
C'mon just ride with me
As I take you on a trip in the mind of me
Me, me, me, me

[Verse Two: Jay Electronica]
It's Jay Renaissance Man, On the Red Eye from France
Passers by say the meteoric rise was happenstance
But everything is illuminated in retrospect
So I expect respect from the less introspect-
-ful on the next go, now lets go
Jay Quetzo, niggas know the manifesto
Came in the game like presto
Unsigned hype, the five mics
Emcees is blinded by the light
Blinded by the right, right hook off the jab
Dip, I'm swift with the lyrical gift
Niggas is stiff, I'm fluid
That's how I pillage through the game like the druids
Now everybody and they mama askin around who is
Jay Electrotherapy, niggas in shock
I'm a workhorse, sending rappers into the workforce
It's the Chitown, New Orleans with jeans sprrrrrrrrat
Take that, and bow down to the king naamean

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Naledge]
I'm so glad I ain't gotta answer calls no more
No more coffee trips, buyin' chips from the store
Puttin' cheeses on a table for a meetin' that I can't attend
At my desk late night, pad and a pen
Sippin' a Henn
Nigga just wonderin' when
I'll get a chance to represent for the City Of Wind
Robert and Helen raised me, streets of the Chi made me
Doe like a pastry
Hungry niggas hate me
Fans at my shows and they souping me like some biscuits and some gravy
Long way from rhymin' and rappin' 'bout my Mercedes
DJ's played me, now they gotta play me
Sittin' in my room thinkin' I was goin' crazy
Waitin' for a label to decide if they wanna pay me
Swearin' I was Jay-Z
Took everything I had just to not get lazy
But I stood Firm like Foxy, Nas and AZ
Knowin' in my heart that my skills was impeccable
More than respectable
Good to get a check or two
Especially special over the bass and the treble
Sayin' I'm drivin' gotta put the pedal to the metal
So here we go with no further ado
Naledge the prince of the Chi, representin' for you

[Hook]
