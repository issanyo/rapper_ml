[Verse 1]
This goes out to those that choose to use
Disrespectful views
On the game of H-i
P-H-o-p, we terrorizing you misfits
These wack emcees got the game twisted
We don't give a fuck about your rings or your chains
Your four-dot six Range
Or Frankie B jeans
I came in the game muhfucka, it's death to the bling
Jay Elect reign supreme over everything
Meet the heavenly man, mics in my hand I rip 'em
Brrrr-ha stick 'em ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Wack rappers we vick 'em
And leave 'em for dead
For spitting that wack shit
That they see in they head
Mufucka'
A new beginning - Forever

[Verse 2]
The last dragon, carrying weight like Oprah
Redeemer of Abnner Louima and Sankofa
I mash out more posses than Billy and Fame
Sucka emcees rock ice but they really in flames
Eighty-five think they free but they really in chains
Talking that big willie looking silly and strange
Earthquakes and rain, hail, snow, locusts and bees
All of the above is caused by the dopest emcees
Back day I used to rock Adidas open with Lees
Windmill on the cardboard and close with the freeze
Silly suckas

[Verse 3]
It's War with The Dragon, visit your day see god
Spar with a passion, this is your day swing hard
As I spark your imagi-nation it may seem odd
This world is crazy hard, but it made me god
Rock with the blastmaster of rock with a rap masters
The Notorious BIG and 2Pac were the last pastors
I gotta grab the, torch and lead the flock to the pastures
Return of the Jedi, who stud-ied under the master
Jakes wanna creep me, the eighth beast seeks to defeat me
I'm feelin leapy, Homeland Security breechy
They can't compete B, my Third Eye vision is 3D
Seeing what Maussan couldn't civilize in the BC
Rap is a misfit, a cheap trick covered with lipstick
Yappin about freaknik, and plattin about deep-dish
War with The Dragon, I'm here to clash with the beast
Harass the Police, in the process of establishing peace
Forever!
