When I was sleeping on the train
Sleeping on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change masterin' the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jackin' our slang
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of a angel tellin' me my name
Tellin' me that one day I'ma be a great man
Transformin' with the MegatronDon spittin' out flames
Eatin' wack rappers alive shittin' out chains
I ain't believe it then, nigga I was homeless
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Tryna find the meaning of life in a Corona
Till the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him

"You either build or destroy, where you come from?"
"The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum"
"Hmm, its quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"

Question 14, Muslim lesson 2: Dip diver, civilize a 85er
I make the devil hit his knees and say the Our Father
Abracadabra! You rockin' with the true and livin'
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B, Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
6 Mile, 7 Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on
Drive up on the curb at a barbecue and hop up out the back like "whats up"
"Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, buss up"
That's why when you talk that tough talk I never feel ya
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya

Nas hit me up on the phone said "what you waitin on"
Tip hit me up with a Twit said "what you waitin on"
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot sayin
"When you gon drop that verse nigga you takin long"
So now I'm back spittin that He could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin Addidas out on Hollis Ave
That F.O.I., Marcus Garvey, Nikki Tesla
I shock you like a eel, electric feel, Jay Electra

They call me Jay Electronica â€¦ fuck that
Call me Jay ElecHannukah, Jay ElecYarmulke
Jay ElectRamadaan Muhammad Asalaamica
Rasoul'Allah suphana wat'Allah through your monitor
My Uzi still weigh a ton, check the barometer
I'm hotter then the mothafuckin' sun, check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My momma told me "never throw a stone and hide your hand"
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black and then devise a plan
Out in London, smokin', vibin' while I ride the tram
Givin' out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And, by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock
Building by the millions
My light is brilliant
