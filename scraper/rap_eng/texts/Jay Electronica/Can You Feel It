[Intro]
It's real, you feel it
And my crew

[Verse 1]
Everybody witness the power as I reign supreme
I lay low in the cut then rise to the top like cream
I've been rhyming since the days of old
Since Christian Dior, velour waves and [?]
My microphone is my rod, my staff
Only God is my math
Meditate to escape Allah and his wrath
The [?] is a marvelous path, conquer my hatred
The sacred, tied to a pillow and stripped naked
The life and times of Christ, we cite it on mics
Magnolia street life, the limelight be city street lights
MCs mistreat mics, I burn 'em like Hitler when quotin' scriptures
Blast backs out, swallow the fruit and spew the trash out
Then I'm stuck here 'til I learn to say, "Fuck fear"
And start buildin' for the children of the 17 plus 2 million
Chill on Mars, stealin' bars on paper for haters
Then return back to Earth in a very fine vapor

[Hook]
Jeri you are the one
The one that they'll see it
And now that you have come
We know they will feel it

[Verse 2]
Here in the form of Je'ri as can be
Singin' the song in a key that appeals to the babies
Singin' the song in a key that appeals to the ladies
Allah is a great chef and he filled me with gravy
Use the forces of nature just to kill me a navy
Resurrect the same dead men and build me a navy
How can he be so wise and still be a baby?
Cause I learned from the best, plus burned some of the best
It was all a dream like B.I.G. said in "Ready to Die"
Like R. Kelly said, yo, I'm ready to fly
I'm the swiftest sharpshooter with the steadiest eye
Ain't no whack rapper out ready as I
Who been rockin' since the days of Rocksteady? It's I
Who been drivin' since the days of Fab Freddy? It's I
If you feelin' strong, cock rock, ready to try
I feel for you like Chaka Khan, I'm the don

[Hook]
Jeri you are the one
The one that they'll see it
And now that you have come
We know they will feel it
