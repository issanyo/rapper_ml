Upgrade to DEFCON 4
It's war with the dragon
10,000 zealots packed tight in a wagon
Aiming for the head of the beast with horns
Queen's knight to C3, son the beef is on
When I was a young buck my mom tried to school me;
"Son, I'm a angel, but the devil want to rule me
Hidin' in the bush trying to swallow my seed
Have patience, move cunning, never wallow in greed."
Yes ma'am, when I make a big man
I wage war, settle the score
Revenge all the fathers of yore;
Got my mic in my one hand and sword in the other
Jay Electronica, The Lord of the Thunder
It's drama in the wilderness
I'm molding a way
3000 by 2000 square miles of clay
Babylon baby London, the dye is set
From the UK to USA, my death threat
Reign supreme, I leave cracked atom and found cream
Allah team convene over coffee and cream
These yellow-back rappers tuck tail and flee swiftly
Many men want to take my life like 50
But I push through the threshold and press to the death
Step by step I heal through bass and treble cleft
Its war with the dragon, man up and react
As I launch this nuclear attack on wax, motherfucker!
