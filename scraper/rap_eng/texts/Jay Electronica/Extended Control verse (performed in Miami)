{Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Entirely off the record
The messiahs of society quietly walk with lepers
But when they plugged into the matrix
The babies have dreams of making love on a spaceship
You can hear atheist cries in the sub when the bass hit
My grandmother died last year and although i cried a lot
I thought about my sins and the demons of my past and the skeletons i hide
And all the things I lied about
And every line of coke and pub i sat and emptied bottles out
Tell me what's it all for
Coming down the next morning grovelling on all fours
It takes place in transit/
The story of Oz we know, takes place in Kansas
But when the picture's in black and white, we take things for granted
Signs on the highway, a stranger on the train
That tiny voice inside your stomach begging you to change
We on a non-stop voyage through space and time
I fall on my knees and pray to heaven that i stay sublime
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it because I'm brown or is it because I'm from uptown
My life story is etched in the bricks of the projects
I'm everywhere but never expected like disc-shaped objects
Haters will never get it,  those thats in the know say I'm the greatest to ever spit it
But that's arguable, they all keep arguing
The deeper I go with the flow they all keep gargling
All the way to Parliament
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then rained on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spitting this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgeting with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock, then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
Cause I endured a lot of pain for everything that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissing you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight, passion of the Christ
Right, to basking in the limelight, it take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place, tangling with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far
