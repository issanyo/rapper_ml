[Intro. Lucy Liu]
And then there was him
Without words, he told me I was all he needed
He transformed my entire outlook on life
He made me believe again
And just like that… I was whole

I was on to something
I knew there was more
Before there was nothing
With him I had all

[The Bullitts]
Monogram hologram
Seeming realistic in a dream
My phonogram
Analogue emotions in a stream
Wave radio
Beautiful fire gasoline my love

Running like railroad train
Whistle like wind in rain
Bitter moon and sun exchange a glance
Turn away…

Close your eyes
Radio lies
Here’s dynamite sonic in real-time
This is your life
Cradle and knife
Everything grow until die

Here we go, stereo
Turning volume down again
My merry go
Mystical reflections call a pen
Write heat explode
Falling nearer to the end my love

Running like railroad train
Whistle like wind in rain
Bitter moon and sun exchange a glance
Turn away…

Close your eyes
Radio lies
Here’s dynamite sonic in real-time
This is your life
Cradle and knife
Everything grow until die

[Jay Electronica]
Have you ever had that feeling like you been falling for weeks in a well?
I was on the verge of dying like E.T. in the bald spot in the forest, right next to the speak and spell
Tryna phone home but the signal wouldn’t reach the cell
Tryna hold on a little longer teeth and nail
Without a hand to wipe the tears away from my cheek when they fell
When I couldn’t get peace from a pipe or chiefing an L
I thought of the words of pastor Dunn when he said;
“Son, at first they screamed hosanna on the highest then turned around and crucified the christ after a week in jail”
Stick to the script like paper clips and coffee stains
Never let a seed of doubt deter you from your lofty aims
The will is much stronger than the flesh
And it only grows stronger when you’re going through duress
Imagination is the factory that makes legends
Close Your Eyes and dream B.I.G. like Faith Evans
