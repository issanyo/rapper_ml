[Verse 1]
In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less down
I promise myself to pack my bags and visit a nearby town
And climb into the top
Or grab the microphone and rock
And all the party people in the place to be will say
Damn that boy can rock!

[Hook]
Now everybody in the place
Clap your hands
And everybody in the space
Clap your hands
To all the people in the party
Clap your hands
Come on rock your body
Clap your hands
Now everybody feel good
Clap your hands
And let me be understood
Clap your hands
We came to get down
Clap your hands
And to the funky fresh sound
Clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Uh puerto rico!
Jump on it [x3]
And everybody on the east coast!
Jump on it [x3]
And to my people on the west side!
Jump on it [x3]
And if you in that midwest ha!
Jump on it [x3]

[Verse 3]
Now what you hear is not a test, I'm just a rapping to the beat
I got a crease in my dickies and a fresh white tee with diadoras on my feet
I hope you understand that my one and only plan
Is to make you feel good, make you clap your hands
And once the feeling hits your body then you act and dance and come on!

[Verse 4]
I spit that uptown body rock raddy ha
And will a nigga ever shut me down probably not
Cause ever since I was a young lad I crushed mcs
Kicking ass taking names at the trolley stop
And everybody know
I got a lot a flow
I'm from that Mag to that Melph to that Calliope
I'm well known in the spots where you barely go
And on the designated spot rocking every show

[Verse 5]
Now take it to the dirty south now
And jump on it [x3]
And I'll pay for it
If I want it [x3]

[Hook]
