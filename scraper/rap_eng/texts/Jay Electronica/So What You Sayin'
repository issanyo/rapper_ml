Jay Electronica :
Yeah
Jay Electronica is now in the building
I dedicate this to all you wack motherfuckers rappin' go get a job

Jay Electrolysis probing the globe like a geologist
Puttin' all of you pussies on display like gynecologists
Listen, I'm on a mission
Most of you niggas just spittin'
The wise comprehend the diction hypnotized with the rhythm
Lyrical circumcision toss the shmuck in the fire
Yeah your mans and them is nice but they ain't fuckin' with Sire
I'm a higher power devour all you idolaters
You Satan worshipers nation perverters thirstin' for dollars
Jay Coldplay putting the clock on your chess game
I'm a varsity letterman you a fresh-mayne
Every line of every verse of every song is a quotable
Catch me in Mexico meditating with Quetzalcotl fuckers
I'm raining fire on you lame suckers
My tongue is the burner the barrel the biscuit don't make me buck it sprat
I'm outta that mac I came into rap carrying the south on my back
And I'm ready to scriddap
It ain't where you from son it's where you live at
I'll never kiss another niggas bum to get me did-dap
I used to sip the coke and rum blowin' dime sid-dacks
But now I'm wagin' war with wicked men in high places
So what you sayin'

Yeah yeah uhh uhh
Fuck a hook
Yeah, things will never be the same after this one

Every page of my poetry's like a round from the clip
The mic is always in my holster right on top of my hip
Niggas get flipped
When the hollow-tips spit at they melons
You niggas is Missy Misdemeanor my niggas is felons holla'
Me and Big Dame Lord of the Rings the Twin Towers
Knockin' other motherfuckers out the ring like Apollo Creed
You wanna get bleed the blood run up
And get done up until sunup
Down south they call me white man cause I hang emcees
Get 'em open with ease
Then pick 'em off like fleas nigga please
You ain't go no ends in me casa
Que pasa
My flow'll fuckin' swolle ya' bumba rasta
Loch Ness monster
It's like "RAAAAAA" when I strike ya'
Suplexin' niggas like Rowdy Rod Piper
John Allen Muhammad snipe ya'
It's a cost to be the boss and I paid the price-ah
Nobody's nicer
I'm cold as the North Pole nobody's icer
Shout outs to Mr. Porter, D-Twizzy, and Obie Tricer
Shady, you can catch me in the D now baby it's all gravy
Still reppin' u-p-t what is you sayin'

Yeah what is you sayin'
Ali, Sadiq we 'bout to spit fire on these motherfuckers for one thousand two hundred and sixty days

I'm trapped in the game like Pacmayne chasing the ghost
Drownin' with water in my throat got leaks in the boat
Squeezin' the toast
It's not a op-tion I got Pac on
Makaveli the don bumpin' that 'Me
And my Glock' song, zone in
Like Robert De Niro I'm Ronin
Struck 'em up with the omen
From adolescence to grown men
Walk a mile in my shoes it proves you a soldier
I paid a lot of dues to prove to Jehovah
That I can carry the cross the castle the crown
Everywhere I roam is my home life's my battleground
Salahuddin Abdul Fard Muhammad
To come up by night ridin' Elijah the Comet (uh)
I cave chest in the brave chessman
Masterin' one twenty lessons is my profession
So get to steppin'
Or catch lead (Led) like Zeppelin
These rap cats look real but they really not like wrestlin'
Check the solar commander
I'm light years off of the scanner
Satellite dishes and cameras a bad mamma jamma
The most thorough examiner
My microphone is seven thousand nine hundred and twenty six miles in diameter
The son of man
Son of *t man* from out Puran
Master the air in the land from here to Iran
Jay Electronica revolve the world
Them Philly cats say "I like that boy he raw but he thorough"
What you sayin'

Yeah, yeah
To all you thug motherfuckers
You ain't a thug
All you Pac imitators
You ain't doing what Pac is doing
Pac was trying to start the motherfucking revolution
You niggas is cowards
We soldiers for God, we soldiers for Christ
Fall in or lay down
Fuck out of here
Either you with Satan or you with God
Nigga that's it
Choose or die nigga
Jay Electronica
Miguel el Chavarria
