[Verse 1]

Um bash dash I had to break, I had to get away
Pack my bags, headed for grey hound and it was a Monday
Time to start my mission, I felt that burning feeling in my soul I had to listen
I had this reoccurring dream from the stage, in a suit with a fade
I had set the game a blaze, and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel, where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where ni**as cussed out the police and sold they're crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs, and the Spanish wrong, and the Blacks wrong, there he go with that song
You may be tired, but I spit what I'm inspired, from the Lord to the worlds, cuz the devil is a liar


[Chorus]
Say say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roll
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Cuz I'm getting stronger (cuz I keep getting stronger, yea)


[Verse 2]
Here we go
My style is like a shot of Jack Daniels, a baby grand piano
Lighting a hop, smoking a cig, strumming on a banjo
The son of man's a song of a gun with hella ammo
The sheriff shootin Bob Marley, John J. Rambo
6 sextillion, 19 million, the holy pyramid say we all a lost children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal em
Then silence you with force, and then indoctrinate the children
Yo Gabba Gabba, Amandine Jaguar
Blow up your apartment if you don't observe the sabath
I look the devil in his eyes, say ab ra ca da bra
Then drown him in the mighty light, his brain couldn't fathom
Scrappin every day, just like Fight Club
A Thriller and a Smooth Criminal, just like Mike was

[Chorus]
Say say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roll
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Cuz I'm getting stronger (cuz I keep getting stronger, yea)
