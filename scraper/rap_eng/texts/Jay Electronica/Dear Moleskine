[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Have you ever ever ever been depressed so bad
It was a struggle every day not to regret your past
Feeling cursed like you never ever get your swag
And you was speeding down the highway when your threshold pass
When you cried all your tears out
And one page of your diary can tell you what your year 'bout
That's a lonely place
My mama said "Son, why such a lonely face?"
Because the pressure's on me
Plus I feel like Bill Murray trapped in Punxsutawney
Dr. Phil told me that I can sell crack or hit the army
Look at where we live at, tell me you don't hear that
Tell me you don't feel that, show me to the way out
Tell me when pastor Raphael gon' reveal that
If not, man I'm outta here
I'm just a sleep walking robot that's outta gear
I stick my nose out the water to the sky for air
Lama sabachthani
I'm trying to see light but the devil trying to blind me
The grim reaper walking with his shovel right behind me
Trying to introduce me to the untimely unkindly
I walk the line finely like Johnny Cash
But I keep getting visits from the ghost of the past
So I spark another L then I go to the pad
