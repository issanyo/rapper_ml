[Verse] [Jay Electronica]:
When the musics in my system
Ain't no tellin' if he Muslim if he Christian
That's what they be yellin'
I'm god by blood
Not relation
So what a bum bum is from creation
I never got hated on directly to my face
I never got tased
I never got maced
I never went to jail without rumbling the cops
Who thought a nigga was a slave trying to put me in my place
And that's just the preface
A universal message from the land of the lepers
The camouflaged wolves stealing lambs from the shepherds
Your average John Malkovich
Transform myself to the wind like The Alchemist
You know what the outcome is
