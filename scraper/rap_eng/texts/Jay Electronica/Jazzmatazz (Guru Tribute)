Boom bash dash
I had to break, I had to get away
Pack my bags, headed for Greyhound, it was a Monday
Time to start my mission
I felt that burning feeling in my soul, I had to listen
I had this reoccurring dream from the stage and the suit with a fade
I had set the game ablaze and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold their crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs and the Spanish and the blacks wrong
There he go with that song, you may be tired but I spit what I'm inspired
From the Lord of the worlds 'cause the Devil is a liar

[Chorus]
Say, say..
I've seen the lightning flashing (yes, I did) and I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long) 'cause I'm getting stronger

[Chorus]
My style is like a shot of Jack Daniels, a baby grand piano
Lightening Hopkin, smokin' cigs, strummin' on the banjo
The son of man's the son of a gun with hella ammo
Sheriffs shootin' Bob Marley, John J Rambo
Six sextillion, 19 million, the holy pyramids say we all Allah's children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal them
They silence you with force and then indoctrinate the children
Yo Gabba Gabba, Ahmadinejad a blow up your apartment if you don’t observe the Sabbath
I look the devil in his eye and say Abracadabra
Then drown him in a mighty light his brain couldn’t fathom
Scrappin' every day just like fight club, a thriller and a smooth criminal like Mike was
