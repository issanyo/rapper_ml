[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Mic check one, bitches and drugs
I'll pop a hot slug in the back of a thug
My chrome rims is spin *blurts out*
Back to reality
These niggas gone mad with the fairy tale mentality
Bound by doubt I stood still in the mayhem
Relaxed all night and chilled in the AM
That's when I got a call from Sinister Sam, hello

[Sinister Sam]
Peace god it's me I just came home from Matawan
I beat a charge down in Chevy Chase, Maryland
But when I came home I was faced with the case
With black chicken-head Stacey on the witness stand tattling
I tried to call you but Breezy told me to...

[Jay Electronica]
Take it easy homie you know these land lines is land mines
One step ka-BOOM... twenty years of man time

[Sinister Sam]
True indeed god I see your math you know they can't fade us
But don't stress

[Jay Electronica]
Nevertheless
I'm back from my hiatus

[Sinister Sam]
Good, niggas is in the background dying to know the status

[Jay Electronica]
Yeah I was out in Vegas
Me and Just Blaze politicking on the latest
I mastered both sides of the force like Darth Plagueis
Now I'm wildin' on you haters
Style Wars, Jay the greatest
King of the kings
Lord of the rings
Savior of saviors
The black rennaissance man of rap
Spitting magic on you silly rabbits
