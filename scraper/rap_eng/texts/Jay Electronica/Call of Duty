[Intro: Winston Churchill]
Centuries ago words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of Truth and Justice. Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valor, and be in readiness for the conflict; for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altar. As the Will of God is in Heaven, even so let it be

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
You know the story
When real see real, we recognize
When you see the steel flash, you petrified
Steve Jobs seen death after just retiring
Takes vision to build, God bless the dead
That’s Mac, that’s 'Pac, that’s Pun, that’s Big
Shit, niggas know the sunshine eternal
I burn slow like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
I went from Myspace to the top of the food chain
The sperm hit the egg like a missile
Then 9 months later the celebratory news came
Exhibit C gave the whole world a mood change
Electronic, niggas call my album detox
Cause they know I’m finna bring the next chronic
Roc Nation, Cole World, it's a wrap nigga
Put yo diamonds in the sky take that nigga

[Hook: Prodigy]
Yeah, put your diamonds in the sky
Wave ‘em side to side, get juxed for your shine
As time go by, we live by an eye for an eye
I’ll die for you, your drama is mine
Put your diamonds in the sky
Wave ‘em side to side, get robbed ‘fore you shine
As time go by, we live by an eye for an
I’ll die for you, your beef is mine

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, to whom it may concern
If it’s hate, wait your turn, dig a crate, make a urn
Please God, tell Flex drop a bomb on me
Tell the Minister to tattoo the Qur'an on me
Before the men in black try to pin a crime on me
And Rupert Murdoch and his goons get to lyin' on me
The Lord is my shepherd
So tell the royal family to order my records
And spread 'em cross Europe in a organized method
We could heal the planet with a organized effort
The Jews and the Christians and the Muslims and the Buddhists
And the Sikhs and Scientologists is all of my brethren
Play this on the radio
You never heard another nigga say this on the radio
We made it out the ghetti-o
Brunch with the Rothschilds, dinner with the Carters
Jay Elect stop the press, criticalest artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
I done sat around for years daydreamin’ of this
Me and Jay biz, green gettin’ twist
Kids goin’ to school, we still on the bench
Early mornin’ yawning, no sleep, just this
Hardcore, rhymin’ like a diamond when I spit
Come hell or high water, we gon’ make it out the bricks
I done graduated gladiator school, what’s next?
From the bottom, only one way to go to the tip
Of the top, with these nonstop flows I invent
Bars so hard, shit hurt when it hit
My bars like prison bars, I’m trapped in the pens
Of this wildstyle hip-hop, the fuckin’ strongest
Rappers on the earth, it’s a curse and a gift
Black cloud follow my life, how worse could it get?
Respect, power, and money, in that exact order
I got it all, nigga, I’ll break ya lil' neck

[Hook]
