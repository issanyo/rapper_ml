High tech Mic abuse with the fuse lit
I run through crews quick and use music to prevail
It’s the return home New Orleans foundation Brooklyn the fortress
Take no losses just win and mega-ends dividends
Big body Benzes what we came for knowledge is what we aim for
Then understandin
Build a castle in this rap game then bring my mans in
To my hardcore slum cats hooded up like clansmen
From 3rd ward to Tasker we Lord and Master
Illadel (P-lon (?)) exile infadels we bomb
We strong arm leg leg arm head honcho
Make moves and skate like Juice in the Bronco
Build, elevate and expand (sit with communist(?))
N***az got John Blaze shit but my shit’s the Johnnyest
Black (germ (?)) dominant prominent scientist
My style (……) like Jet Li (….) the Lion Fist
You lost once I spit the sick shit, lyrically gifted
My tongue is like the cold barrel my brain’s the biscuit
Don’t get it twisted, I’m from the south black seriously doubt that
You wanna go to war with a soldier because we ‘bout that
So don’t go there, headed for nowhere, we wild like it’s no courts
No judge no police and no mayor
3rd ward is third world, revolution in the bricks
Soldiers in fatigues we come equipped, that’s it

[Chorus - throughout]
So, que te pasa?
Representando por la raza
Niggas wanna step but they legs is too short to salsa
You got courage I'll blast it out ya
Seriously doubt ya
Spit til ya blueprint is ripped, then re-route ya
