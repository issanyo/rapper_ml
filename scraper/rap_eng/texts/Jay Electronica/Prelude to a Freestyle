I fell out the sky like baby Superman to a farm on kansas
Now the world wanna see my story all on camera
That’s magic, described by a hater, that’s tragic
Billy Shakespeare was in his grave doin backspins
The attractive power of every verse was so intense the ladies required napkins
The credits rolled: below average seemed lavish garbage ass rappers
With a gaudy no class chain and a fitted turned backwards
Black on black anti semite rap wazyap
I’m out that Nolia So niggas’ll surely clap if I ask em
Whip a nigga out his clothes from Freret to Jackson
Nobody’ll ever wonder or talk about what happened
C’mon son, who better than us? Them?
They ain’t even figure out they own style yet man
And every rhyme I ever spit out my face was spotless
Any bitch I ever said strip to got topless
Any click whoever said shit they got rocked
So sugar Shane Mosley yo ass up out the cockpit
We natural born fly guys
Twist up yo Garcia Y Vegas and toast to the wise guys
We made it to the high rise
Georgy and Weezy and Lionel and Jenny Kravitz
Jigga and J. Cole, Jay Electronica, magic
Jeeeeesus, uprisings in Egypt
The black Gods free up, the Land erupt
I hope one y’all is feelin me
Some of yall gotta wait til the final act of the trilogy to get it
Oh I get it, niggas wanna hear me spit it
But I never take shots without establishing pivots
Itsy bitsy spider climbing up the water spout
Moses with his rod hit the staff and got the water out
Powerful parables
I learned from the lips of my uncle Charles comin outta the VA like Clipse
Now there’s a whole wealth to dig thru
But yo shit it’s too shallow for me to dig you
Feel me, man these wack niggas kill me
The wordplay was sweet but the rhymes don’t thrill me
You lose, quit believing in the news
The Asiatic Blackman conveniently rules
Sincerely yours, the most global, the most total
