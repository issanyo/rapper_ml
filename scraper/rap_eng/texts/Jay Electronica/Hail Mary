[Intro: Jay Electronica]
For every casualty I felt, I blow a hundred racks
Hit the strip club, blow a hundred stacks
Tell the DJ to run it back, run it back

[Pre-Hook: Jay Elecronica]
Money by the trash bags, a body in a Glad bag
If the 3rd Ward is Iraq, then the Magnolia is Baghdad
My swag is verified, you fags is terrorized
The AK-47 life'll leave you niggas paralyzed

[Hook: Jay Electronica]
Hail Mary for all my niggas in the cemetery
Our Father for every nigga waitin' on commissary
Every soldier that died in Magnolia took a long time to bury
It's all kinds of scary
Cause it's quite hard to maintain that soldier-life mentality
It's gon' be a tragedy if that white man come and hassle me
Slap me down and wrestle me, just to put on handcuffs
Charge me with resistance when I throw my hands up

[Bridge: Jay Electronica]
Just consider me Uptown
Where your whole clique could get bucked down
I fuck with that 1.5
But I never listen to Bust Down
In that 'Nolia, niggas get fixed to runnin' them bricks
Like they runnin' touchdowns
You runnin' yo' mouth, they spendin' a band, my nigga
And you gettin' cut down

[Verse 1: Ceto]
I come in ya house, that thing, give that fuckin' [?] to us now
A round from the chopper open up your top and spin your truck 'round
Power, money, respect, niggas know Ceto
Presidential in these streets, pussy nigga you get vetoed
How you scared to look through your peephole
Somebody gon' dig a deep hole catch you talkin' to them people
You gon' learn to respect this G code, that fuckin' UPT code
From that Mac to that [?] I grab that Mac off that shelf
And turn a bad man a pallbearer and put your casket on my belt

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ceto]
You ask me why I do it, I just tell 'em that I can
It's that soldier-life mentality, real niggas understand
Keep that 40 in my hand, ridin' around in the city
It's some shit you never seen, make you think of Dr. King
The way a nigga livin' dreams, I'll approach ya like a ghost
Been a gangster since the 90's I done done more than most
We got money up in trash bags, bodies in the Glad bags
Ain't nothin' changed since '94, we still wearin' them soldier rags

[Pre-Hook: Jay Elecronica]
Money by the trash bags, a body in a Glad bag
If the 3rd Ward is Iraq, then the Magnolia is Baghdad
My swag is verified, you fags is terrorized
The AK-47 life'll leave you niggas paralyzed

[Hook: Jay Electronica]
Hail Mary for all my niggas in the cemetery
Our Father for every nigga waitin' on commissary
Every soldier that died in Magnolia took a long time to bury
It's all kinds of scary
Cause it's quite hard to maintain that soldier-life mentality
It's gon' be a tragedy if that white man come and hassle me
Slap me down and wrestle me, just to put on handcuffs
Charge me with resistance when I throw my hands up

For every casualty I felt, I blow a hundred racks
Hit the strip club, blow a hundred stacks
Tell the DJ to run it back, run it back

[Outro: Ceto]
Rest in peace to all the dead niggas come out the motherfuckin' projects, ya heard me
And every ghetto worldwide
Real nigga gon' hold it down
