[Intro: Jay Electronica]
Uh  huh
It's the realness
Don't feel this
All praises due, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
The god Je'Ri goes clean off of the edge
My life is like a movie, spit a scene off of the head
Agents in the temple make obscene offers to feds
I run up in they cypher if it seem off of they fez
Style holding my square 'cause if I lean off then I'm dead
Spit a hot shot and leave your team awfully red
Club promoters that'd see me gleam off of me bread
The leprechauns left the party cream offer me bed
Allah team convene over cream coffee and eggs
Building and atoning, We live for the moment
At times I kick back and shed tears when I'm zoning
Flowing in the whip shifting gears when I'm rolling
I shook off my kirch struggled years with the omen
Emcees that come near catch a severe microphonin'
I came along paying dues and such
Biting emcees and whack rap crews get touched
You ain't got a lot of heart, but my crew's too rough
Yo a lot of false gods got drove when we arove
Hardy heartless record execs offer me gold
This world nailed Je'Ri to the cross, but he rose
With all power
Switching the game cause it's all sour
Thugs claiming they thugs, but they all cowards
Wisen up young bucks, you out of touch with reality
And that can only lead to fatality

[Verse 2: ???]
Same old scenario niggas, but the scary old niggas
Got shit twisted up to reality and illusions and mix it up
We fallen and forgotten how to get back up
And in turn react up, cats on this block be like actors
Like we ain't got to suffer consequences of sabbath's actions
Everything we do should be totally intact
That's why the fuck that you laughin'
I speak with urgency cause this nonchalancy doesn't servin' me
This is an emergency

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
I knew this kid Jack, he was nimble also pretty quick
Used to hustle off his powder bags on African defith
A faithful blackstone, busting at the GDs, the GP
Locked up every other week and phoning home, like E.T
Jill paid his bail, you know the one who do nails?
Were in the back of the shop, you get the burnout on your cell
Yeah, she dig me, I met her once before inside the fig tree
Before it was the spot where all the undercover pigs be
But back to the subject, Jack they called a menace to the public
Cause he was on some thug shit, you loved it
Whipping let the slugs drip and blood drip with tight crews
But he was on some Tom Cruise shit
Back at school, went to college on a scholarship
I don't know what happened
Two years later out of school, now he's clappin'
Strappin' macs trapped in a world of dissatisfaction
Slippin' and blastin', gettin' lost in the mister action
A victim of the system, a waterless sea
Yo his cream-lusting heart grew harder with greed
He was a wild style child, busting guns was his steez
Outside of his girl and his seed he didn't care who else bleeds
But one day Jack decided to retire from gun play
Didn't wanna see the graveyard where all his thugs lay
Dying young, Jack didn't want to hear that
But what goes around knows exactly where you live at
About a month later Jack got his life right
And he and Jill took his son to the park one night
It was the first time his seed was standing up for him
And then this 'round-the-way kid ran up on him
And said, "Yo cousin', I got plans for you"
Cause my moms OD'ed at the hands of you
Cocked his shit back, hit two at his seed
Block the shit back
Until this day, Jack the nimble never forget that
The moral to this story is not that hard
You go home and figure it out


[Outro: Jay Electronica]
Fairyality tale, chump
Feeding our babies with the garbage
It's whack, you ain't real
The whole squad is whack
You whole record label is whack
Slave
