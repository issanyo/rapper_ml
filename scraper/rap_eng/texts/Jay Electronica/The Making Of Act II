[Jay Electronica]
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
Love is the only thing that can save us all

[Chorus: LaTonya Givens]
Blue though you make me blue
You, I'm in love with you
Life is a hollow call in a circle sometimes
Rain though you make it rain
Again you hurt me again
Less is a virtue, love will desert you sometimes

Jaymes Samuel: Wicked! Now just do one more chorus where you just riff kinda want it

[Verse: LaTonya Givens]
Faith has a bow that will never know
You told me you changed and
Things won't be the same
I can't do this no no nooooo no
Won't you let me go?
Gooooooooooooooo
Goooo, goooo, gooo
Let me go

If you could say let us go! let us go!
That song fits, oh my goodness!
That's why it's giving me chills

Jay: Who gets to dance with you first?
Jaymes Samuel: I get the first dance, I get the first dance

[Chorus: LaTonya Givens]
...Call in a circle sometimes
Rain though you make it rain
Again you hurt me again, noooouh
Less is a virtue, love will desert you sometimes
Okay let me finish that right here
Winter will cry, for the words in a lie
I hand back your name as I burned your chain
I can't do this no no nooooo no no
Won't you let me go?
Gooooooooooooooo
Goooo, goooo, gooo
Let me go
Blue though you make me blue

[Outro: LaTonya Givens]
I'm just blessed to be chosen to erm you know
To be a part of this amazing movement that's about to go down, this its it's exciting you know, so
Peace out y'all
