[Intro: Morgan Freeman]
Across the gulf of space, vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded our planet with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us

[Hook: Curtis Mayfield]
Some people feel so empty
All their problems and hurt of pride
You make me so happy sweet baby
Love is by my side

[Verse: Jay Electronica]
Don't get it confused
This message is for solo artists, but I get at crews
We can make the news
I'll be on the low sippin' daiquiris in Baton Rouge
Or killin' the Rock The Bells with Nas and Posdnuos
It's a small task for Jay-man; wack niggas be dead
And I be laughin', sippin' out my flash, chillin' in my Ray Bans
Imaginary crime boss
With albums full of "Look at how much my watch
And how much my shine cost"
Is time lost
"Who Shot Ya?" The black Bach
Blastin' over operas, phantom of the chakras
Jay-Doppler went from panhandling socks in the Bronx to popular
This is just the start of it
The kid intends to split more wigs than British Parliament
Catch me on the global warming tour with Jigga and Al Gore
Performing "Dear Summer", where Autumn went?
Eternal Sunshine, drum major without a drumline
I be in the D screaming kick rocks to "One Time"
When they say "license and registration," I yell 'em "reparations"
Quote 'em from Revelations, then I peel off in they faces
Young, black, and arrogant with No ID, the most extravagant
They should build me a statue on Grambling campus
With a manuscript that say:
"He got at the best of them
Shot at the rest of them
Ain't no contesting him."
Green said, "It's a lotta niggas talking shit, but we ain't stressin' 'em."
