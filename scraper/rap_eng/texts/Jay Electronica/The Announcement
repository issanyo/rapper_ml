[Introduction: John F. Kennedy]
Its hazards are hostile to us all
Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind
And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again
But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon!
We choose to go to the moon
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard
Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
My view is aerial, your crew inferior
My crew imperial, MC Killers: milk and cereal
Get it? Forget it
You’ll still be connecting the dots with smoking holes in your fitted
Those that got it be all at the shows throwing fitteds
The light from the dynasty sign froze all of the critics
And nary a soul got on they frog toes to ribbit
Shhh…T'was the night before the coming
Sugar plum candy coated lines for the dummies
Decoded hieroglyphics in the shrines for the mummies
We not illuminati but our eye is on the money
My mind's on the scripture -
It’s beautiful,I see every line on the picture
So when the leaves rustle and the cock crows winter
Just know that the Black Gods mingled a bit
Then the fingers got pricked, then the single got picked
Man I’m living out my brain I don’t dream about shit
If I say dream, I meant dream, fresh not Hampton
I got a date with destiny I’m definitely not canceling
Romancing...The Stone
The Roc...The Throne
The elegant celebration sent tremors through every nation
The stars aligned like cars at Grand Central Station...elevation
Yours truly my duty and obligation
A newly appointed ruler who move with no observation like W.D
Say my name on a record, WW III
I’ll put you niggas in a box like the WB
Here’s a footnote on the Blueprint, Whoms fucking with We?
Yeah, bad grammar Widescreen panorama
Paranormal activity seen on the camera
So if you want that turmoil
I’ll Twitter Facebook YouTube Worldstar you
Rap Radar Nahright 2dopeboy you
Your plans is foiled, your guns is borrowed
We living in tomorrow, a tissue for your sorrows
