[Verse 1: Reekado Banks]
Wo'n Komije, Wo'n lami nu
From Naija down to Sierra Leone
Every other girl say they wanna be
If you know what I mean, Oya gbo mi no
London, Hong Kong
Everywhere that I be see they run come
All the girls see is the lineup
They wanna trap my money cause it piles up
Ah, You know I am doin' my shit
I, I know you are feelin' my shit
Follow my shoes, walk in my shoes
Don't deny, know you want to
Wanna spend my dough anna wear my gold
An' I see upon your face say you still wan do

[Hook]
(Let me see you bounce)
And if you know you ready oya wine
Show them all your hips don't lie
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
And if you know you ready oya wine
Show them all your hips don't lie
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down

[Bridge]
Said what you waitin' for?
Get up on your feet and dance some more
Get down, said what you waitin' for?
Said get up on your feet and dance some more
Said what you waitin' for?
Get up on your feet and dance some more
Get down, said what you waitin' for?
Said get up on your feet and dance some more

[Verse 2: Di'ja]
Oh na, na

Oh na, na

Ohhhh, Guantanamera

If you wanna play, come play with don mama
Sexy baller, lady don dada
She got the girls under pressure
She got them boys payin' attention
Everybody [?]
You know [?]
Call your brothers, sisters, [?]
Call your mama, daddy, [?]

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
Babylon, Babylon, tumblin' down
Black lion of Judah, comin' for the crown
Rebel to America, under the ground
We gon' turn this shit 'round or burn this bitch down
Pure wahala, wicked policeman
Lookin' for trouble, gon' find palava
Word to Fela
I lay on the track like a cat on the bread at the Spanish bodega
Third worlder, molotov hurler
Hair like lambs wool, eyes full of murder
Spit it for the Hausa, the Igbo, the Yoruba
Bible on the dashboard, shank in my turban
Weytin dey happen?
Smack an oyinbo back to Manhattan, let's get this shit crackin'
Made it this far by faith through rappin'
Long live Naija, land of the black skin

[Hook]
And if you know you ready oya wine
Show them all your hips don't lie
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
And if you know you ready oya wine
Show them all your hips don't lie
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down
Kwuli otor, get on your feet, get down

[Outro: Jay Electronica]
Turn this shit 'round or burn this bitch down
Turn this shit 'round or burn this bitch down
