Ancient Egypt shining, I see it in my sleep
Another rocketship to the top, this shit is aiming for the deep
We in the final hour of our blinding from the higher power
The time is now, while we go to work to support our lives
All our tax money goes to the forces that divide us
Your gas money goes to corporations with control of the white house
And that money flows from world bankers that hold the whole disguise down
Lie down? Nah, fuck it, matter fact I'm gonna fly now
You gon see me in the sky now
Winged phoenix of the high route
King Leo fucking fire mouth
They gon need a sea to put me out
But they don't got no sea to put me out, only C's to sell to those on streets that go the crooked route, unleash it and we cooking now
DEA is really looking out, unless they launder for you
And your packs of that crack, I still said nothing but truth
Yeah, that's just the facts, and they're coming to you
From the land of the last puppets before the puppeteers lose
So what the fuck they gon do
When I am a revolution
Standing yet ever moving
Expanding until we buddhic
Probably just panic, and abandon what they doin
Because God's plan had never been havoc and confusion
Masters of collusion
Babylon's illusions
Used to manage what we doing, practically asking to remove them
Cause the truth wins, and never dies, rising forever higher
And the blueprints for heaven lie nowhere but inside us
God's will it will guide us
May all my people rise up and abolish what divides us
It was written, the time's come
