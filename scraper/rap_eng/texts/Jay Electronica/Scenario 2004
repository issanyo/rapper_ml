[Verse 1]
Somebody stop me, lord I'm on fire
Sucker emcees better call me sire
I won't stop rocking 'til the moon retire
'Til the prophecy's fulfilled and the earth catch fire
Nope, I ain't trying to be going back into poverty
Working a nine-to-five and be hoping I hit the lottery
Nope, I came too far to turn back on my
Heels like a windmill and head back home-a
I eat a emcee up like Jeffrey Dahmer
Parlaying up in V.I.P. playing the corner
I'm hot like a sauna
I spit a hot shot off of the top you're a goner
Somebody call the coroner
These wack emcees is D.O.A
They label you as a hater when you see yo' way
But, if you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck
You can catch me in the Third Ward throwing it up
You might find me in the nine where they don't mind dying
Screaming five-o in the back of the line
Everytime that I fall up in the spot I shine
Heel up wheel up bring it back home rewind

[Hook]
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's the, what's the, what's the scenario

[Verse 2]
I just wanna keep the peace like a Buddhist
But niggas wanna kiss me on my cheek like Judas
Nigga, then lets do this
I leave em left out, left field, left clueless
They feed off of rumors 'til I hit em with the trueness
They don't hate me
They hate god I ain't make me
I'm just a little nigga on the mic with a breakbeat
What have y'all lames done for me lately
Nada, I keep on movin' and dont bother
The flow's H-2-O, they drown in the water
Step right up and come down to the slaughter
See me in the Third Ward, 6-4 Impala
Brush off my shoulder and pop my collar, holla
See I don't even walk like a pimp, talk like a mack all I do is rap
Uh, you other motherfuckers is wack and that's a actual fact (that's a actual fact)

[Hook]
