And I'd like to say
He's not Flash, but he's fast, and his name is Jay

But here comes a black man. A black man who stands up today and challenges. Here's our champion, here's our champion. The world champion. The heavyweight champion

It's been a long time, maybe too long
Since your audio produced a real rap song

As we proceed

Dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm

Come on, man. Don't go fuckin' crackin' up on me now, nigga. We all in this shit together! Wipe that shit. Come on

I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer

I come at the right time. I come in the fullness of time when it all needs to be wrapped up. [?] I will be more successful than all those that went before me because the time is right, the season is right, you are right, the conditions are right, we must go free now. Now!
