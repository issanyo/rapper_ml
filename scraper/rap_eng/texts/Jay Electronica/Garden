[Intro: Áine Zion]
I'm not telling you to love what I love. I'm asking you to take time to know what it is that you love and are in love with. And do what you can not to offend this sensitive soul, who has seen things no lips can't confess, no pain can bear witness to, no mind can justify, no memory can wipe

[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
Let me love, let me touch, let me love
Baby, give it up, let me drink from the fountain
In the car, on the street, in the dark
Baby, on the beach, in the back of the garden

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
You're in the club, how you dance, how you touch
How you offer up all your love and devotion
Roll it up, spark it up, let it burn
On the balcony, and we can fly to the ocean

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop

[Verse 3: Emeli Sandé]
You make it real, make me feel, make me feel
I'm as strong as steel and as tall as the mountains
Talk is cheap, can you rescue me?
No place I'd rather be than the back of the garden

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, catch up

[Verse 4: Jay Electronica]
Once upon a time ago
I threw my cautions to the wind, my friend
And yelled, "Geronimo!"
And rode the wings of love to outer space
But then I fell a thousand miles to Guantanamo
Euphoria to torture
I left a note that had a rhyme, it go:
Love is like a ferris wheel
Love is like a roller coaster
Love is at a standstill
Body after body after body
It's a landfill
And I just caught a body
In the lobby and got my hands filled
I'm a serial lover
I set up all the dates
That rang up fate and got my friends killed
I barely knew my dad, sometimes I feel like my mother
I love that Purple Rain love
That have a fight, that scratch my face
That fuck outside and ride my motorcycle in the rain love
Love is like a garden, love is like a death sentence
Love is like a pardon, I'm free again and ready
Once outside these prison walls, to believe again is scary
Your garden is my sanctuary

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Back of the garden
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Yeah oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh, I'm ready
Oooh ooh, don't stop

[Outro: Áine Zion]
Be my confidant, my shoulder, my diary, my best friend, my mentor, my lover, my teacher, my preacher, my one and only, my everything. From the beam of the sun to the dim of the moon. From before until always I'm yours. So keep me safe within yourself. Bow to my throne, no matter what, and I will stand tall
