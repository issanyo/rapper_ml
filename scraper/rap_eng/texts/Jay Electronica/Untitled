[Verse: Jay Electronica]

Excuse me while I do me riding rudely down the highway
Smoothly round the by ways
Can a devil fool a Muslim? Nah "not nowadays"
We laughing all the way to where they print the money at
We rapping all the way to where the milk and honey at
We crying we don’t even speak to [?]
(Just Blaze: I'm probably gonna get in so much trouble for playing this)
.....say we funny at
Angela Yee
Tell Charlemagne da god to tell DJ Envy run it back
I hang my hat let you know I’m home
I’m on my grind, I’m on my Deen
On my mobile phone
My BBM with puff and Hov alone is legendary
All you opposing Clones that oppose the throne should never worry
Niggas out here praying that my debut album flops
Or that ACT-II never drop until the 15th Neveruary
I’m spitting scriptures on haters in the track
[?]Drama bring it back Mr Thanksgiving bring it back
