[The Bullitts]
Don't try to hide
You might as well embrace it
You've done it all
Turn around and face it
The teachers say:
The end will never come
But you can't decide
Burying the seasons
The words are gone
Every time you're speaking
The kings return
Now where will you reside?
Run and Hide x3
[Jay Electronica]
Sentimental rain drops
The tears fall in increments
Like incremental pain drops
That wash away the stained spots
The Western World is just a hive of Scum and Villainy
That's why Superheroes wear disguises in trilogies
When the future is uncertain
And the wizard is just a man inside the booth behind the curtain
Behaving like a serpent
With a bag full of everything
Except your home
Just remember, be yourself
And accept your own
Or Run & Hide...
