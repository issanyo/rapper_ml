[Intro: Giggs]
Ahhhhh
Spare, Spare
Calling this one, league fulla champions
See what Sizzle's talking about
Champions League
Feel like I’m running up the steps right now
Struggle and hustle, to the fucking top

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Nigga I've squeezed a couple shotties
You niggas ain't shit
You’ve never put a bullet in a body
You've never put a bullet in a shotty
Or loaded up a 9
And dumped it on another nigga's possie
Niggas hitting gym and getting stocky
But that don't mean shit to me
You won't get close enough to drop me
These pussy niggas acting like they're robbers
But try that shit with me
I'll have you niggas bawling for the coppers
Now the scumbags are hanging on my bollocks
They're tryna stitch me up
Get the handcuffs and slap ’em on us
They’re tryna get my back into a corner
But you can suck your mums
Cuzzy I ain't turning an informer
Niggas fuses out here getting shorter
They’ll put a bullet in you
Next time they're picking up their daughter
Turn your baby mother to a mourner
Now everytime she thinks of you
Her eyes start turning on the water

[Verse 2: Slums]

[Verse 3: Kyze]

[Verse 4: Fem Fel]
