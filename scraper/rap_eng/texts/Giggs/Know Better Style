[Verse 1: Giggs]
Kush balance, fat chain, push carrots
Love repeating? Shush, parrot
Hood talent, wish niggas would challenge
Hood banging up, niggas know we got good cannons
Pressure that paper trail, they're impressed with that flavour
It's that 10% take a boss, that Professor Xavier
Never bring a knife down to a gun fight or test the MAC-10 with that taser
When man's stepping out later, please don't step on my trainer
Big fat chicken act blazer, man might checker that tailor
Man's got lead in that chamber, should've had better behaviour
Just had a sip of that Cognac, straight to the head with that JÃ¤ger
Told her strip for my bredrin and paid her, Dee put the pussy in danger

[Verse 2: Gunna Dee]
Niggas know better, niggas do better
Hating on me for that hoe, I hope you do get her
She knows I'm all about that paper
So I rip the pussy open like a new letter
That's an invite
[?] like a dim light
Life's a bitch
So I had to get it in right
Got that white in
Now I'm tryna get that Porsche in white
Got bores, got a cause
But it ain't always been right
Was a rebel without one
Can't outrun the devil, can't level without one
Nah
Like I said, I got the white in
Came in looking like a soap
Came in all in white
I came in looking like the Pope
You came in looking at the chain
A nigga got beaten to a pulp
Bitches pulling on me
Came in looking like a rope
Know where my part's from
Shit don't end well when it starts wrong
I rinse the 9 like it's Insta
Double tap and your heart's gone
You know where my part's from
So you know what my part's on
If me and Sus are in the club
Know we got bitches to pass on
