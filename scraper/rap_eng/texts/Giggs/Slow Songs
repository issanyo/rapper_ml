They talk about they wanna cut crime down
I do something positive and they fly down
I'm pissed off, so I lie down
Grab a spliff, grab a pen, and I wind down
Mad poverty
Niggers can't get jobs so they buy brown
Buy light, drive round
Tryna hustle on the streets to get the right pound
A little youths getting knifed down
Cos nigga got pissed and brought a knife round
They don't care about a sign said put the knives down
Next little niggers gonna get the knives now
Rinse off the ting and put a life down
Think of the shit we live our lives round
That's why I can't understand all the fight down

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
When the shadows in the sun grow long
We listen to a slow, slow song

I used to roll strapped up packing a Glock
Running round rinsing at the back of a block
Used to shot cats whole packets of rock
Now I make music, what they planning to block
Fuck these lil' faggoty cops
I came a long way from a raggedy top
Old Reeboks, and my Gravitys on
Now everything drops I get my gravity on
The whole industry getting mad at me songs
Saying they don't like me the way I'm carrying on
Been a mad journey
These fucker don't know where I'm travelling from
Tryna make my buzz lighter
Tryna get to me locking down my blud Kyzer
Smoke weed while sipping on a Budweiser

[Hook: Mike Skinner]

It's just a phase we know
That hazy glow
Coming off the blazing road
But I'm like Amir Khan, I appear calm
All that clear charm
But I clip your ear ole' raw
Keep score of what I got
In the drawer with the socks
Feeling ever more than a lot
I used to score shotting at the squats
Fuck it, duck it in the bucket seat
Spunked all my currency and my luck, you see
Am I grind blind
Frightened sometimes
Mixing white wine with whine
Late nights on the pave like
With Dave types
Chitter chatter with the latter
Wave bye
Behave right
Let's stay tight

[Hook: Mike Skinner]
