[Verse 1] [Giggs, Joe Grind, Gunnar Dee]
Whats Good Grind?
Tell you H
Tell em bout growing up on the old estate
What glouster grove? Niggas know the place
Ah shit them was the golden days
Fam to me that's just the olden days
But i'll remeber that shit when im old and grey
Me and lat driving round with them stolen plates
Ah shit them times when I used to roll with fraze
I was chilling with the same crew lat, titch fess
C'mon bruv I know the names too
Broke days every day putting on the same shoes
I remeber writing on the wall and I blamed you
Mum asked who ate the biscuits and I named you
Rah, it was you
C'mon bruv you did the same to
Remember sometimes fam I took the blame too?
I remeber once you took a beating I was grateful

[Chorus]
Im reminiscing bout shit
Joe Grind tell 'em bout it
Gunnar you remeber how it is
Stuck in the hood lets get the hell up out it
I'm reminiscing bout shit
Joe Grind tell 'em bout it
Gunnar you remember how it is
Stuck in the hood lets get the hell up out it

[Verse 2] [Giggs, Joe Grind, Gunnar Dee]
I remember mum dropped us at our dads house
Spend, Gunnar Dee, YG and a bad Mouse
Lil Gunnar stuffing food in his fat mouth
I used to think you ain't my bro move your black self
Spend used to run around the house raising mad hell
YG always getting out ....?
We was on it so we wasn't watching dads belt
I was a little bit soft so the helped
Cos YG used to always try and beat me up
They had all the new toys it used to eat me up
I used to get heated up
It was the last straw when dad got the .... up
I was a sweet kid sweeter than a sweetie shop
Until I thought of something that I need to cop
I remeber when we used to wear them odd socks
Fast forward now we popping up in them odd spots

[Chorus]
Im reminiscing bout shit
Joe Grind tell 'em bout it
Gunnar you remeber how it is
Stuck in the hood lets get the hell up out it
I'm reminiscing bout shit
Joe Grind tell 'em bout it
Gunnar you remember how it is
Stuck in the hood lets get the hell up out it

[Verse 3] [Giggs, Joe Grind, Gunnar Dee]
Lets take it back to the megadrive
Super nintendo
Got terrorised
I remember when your wrist got paralysed
I was playing heat jumped off of the slide
I got it all memorised
Cos these are my memories and Im tellin it guys
Tell 'em grind
Ima tell 'em why
We should tell em bout now
In the present time
These are better times
Now every day yout mans getting present time
Commited several crimes stood up in the dock
Gave the judge a devil smile
Two types of niggas
You can sell or buy
Merked the rap game
Cos we pushed the levels high
Niggas better start telling guys
Ain't no snitching round here
You can tell and die
