Yeah, Hollow
Boom productions (How did you know? Might be confusing)

You worked hard when we needed to get through
To make sure we had meals and to get juice
To buy us all the new clothes and the best shoes
That you could afford although it would stress you
You took a load of my cheek then beat me all over the weekend
I didn't know couldn't see then, you teachin' me and my bro's how to be men
Even if you got paid in the worst way, you made sure I had cake on my birthday
It wasn't even for your sake
I bet you never got to sleep at your work rate
Dropped me to my first rave told me it weren't safe with a hurt face
So I came in early it was Thursday
You know mum's always think of the worse case

I try my best to help out mum you raised me
I know you're feeling stressed out and I blame me
I could be good but it ain't me
I think the hood kinda changed me

I try my best to help out mum you raised me
I know you're feeling stressed out and I blame me
I could be good but it ain't me
I think the hood kinda changed me

You got pissed at me bunnin' weed
Then I started gettin' nicked every other week
I got kicked out, sent to live with my dad, but the prick never wanted me (UMM)
Started rollin' with shit you didn't wanna see
Try to show me the way I didn't wanna see

I made your life hectic and for all the dumb shit that did I wanna give an apology (Sorry)
I just thought "argh shit it don't bother me"
But I forgot about you and that's wrong of me
Went down a bad path but you followed me
That's why I stick my hand out if you can't cope
That's why I give you grands now if you're half broke
Forgive me I've been an arsehole
I wanna give you everything that you ask for

I try my best to help out mum you raised me
I know you're feeling stressed out and I blame me
I could be good but it ain't me
I think the hood kinda changed me

I try my best to help out mum you raised me
I know you're feeling stressed out and I blame me
I could be good but it ain't me
