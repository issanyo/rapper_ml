[Hook]
I see the signs from this crooked life
Fuck my future, I know exactly what it's looking like
Me getting murdered, a look in time
Trying to escape, got me pushing crime

[Verse 1]
I put my pain on the paperwork
When I write this shit down I feel the naked hurt
No mistaken words
I mean everything I say and I make it work
Growing up round here really made me learn
All about the hard way I had to make it burn
Close my eyes and I pray for Termz
I got the news in ATL and it made me squirm
Same time I won the BET
So every time I say it that's exactly what it means to me
So there's no reason you should speak to me
I open up my heart let the people see
Told them they better start getting used to me
Wouldn't be surprised if the police tried to shoot at me
So you need to open up the booth for me
Let me get inside and you'll get nothing but the truth from me

[Hook]
I see the signs from this crooked life
Fuck my future, I know exactly what it's looking like
Me getting murdered, a look in time
Trying to escape, got me pushing crime

[Verse 2]
It's like every other day we screaming rest in peace
Listen to what I got to say cause the message deep
Tryna show them in these depressing streets
Nothing goods happening and that depresses me
I put it right out there get my message pushed
Rest in peace my brother Bigz, he's from Shepherds Bush
Rest in peace Ruthless I hope my blessings took
It's painful, hope I make it to the second hook
They talk about gun crime and we reckless crooks
When it's our own government that get the weapons pushed
You think they gave a shit about Peckham's hood
They drive pass and wouldn't even take a second look
It's only for the strong when you reppin' hoods
I know nigga's that were thugging now they taking booge
Niggas struggle and we ain't far from fluorescent boogs
That's why if I blow, trust me
Peckham's good

I see the signs from this crooked life
Fuck my future, I know exactly what it's looking like
Me getting murdered, a look in time
Trying to escape, got me pushing crime
