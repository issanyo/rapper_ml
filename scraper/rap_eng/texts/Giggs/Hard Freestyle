I think that this the life that mummy wanted for me
Let me know i could be anything i wanted to be
And honestly i feel like this is promised to me
Never thought rap will be filling up my wallet for me
Yeah they finaly acknowledging me
Didn't go collage but i got abit of knowledge in me
Theres never been a fiend or alcoholic in me
But i could be somewhere that i never really wanted to be
So im smoking on that quality weed
In the studio, raping on this quality beat
Im gonna go down in history, historicaly
They can't put me in a box i ain't a quality street
I swallow the beat
Come follow me, the best styles gotta be me
Cop suttin nice, then i want a reciept
Nig***s dont give but wanna recieve

A moment of peace ...
Quick silence for my homies deceised
All my nig***s locked down and i want them released
I jot down what i want them to see
Im hot now they didn't wanna belive
Getting wop now on the top of my drink
Shut down they ain't stopping my team
Im number one in the scene
I was the runner up now u nig***s running with me
And its kinda funny to see
That everyones acting funny with me
Everyone thinks they went in trouble with me
Its when u motherfuckers will see ...
