[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah, Hollow
Niggas acting like they ain't got a girlfriend or something
Like they can't make tunes for the gyaldem

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Baby I'm looking to slice
When I'm jooking it right
Got the look in your eye
No complaints I ain't looking to fight
Cause your tight pum pum got me living the life
I ain't into cocaine in your pussy and flight
You know it ain't like that I'll be chilling tonight
Don't be silly alright?
Mantis is Muslim and even he said you're looking alright
Hot girl, you're looking July
Yeah the rays of your beauty, God should have put in the sky
I had to bad-up Kyze still
Cause even he tried to look on the sly (UUMMM)
Look how greazy your body is
Precious artefact, call me archaeologist
Show me what you're offering
I ain't into losing anything so I gotta win

[Chorus: Didz]
Girls all around the world you should know
It's for us to win your soul, oh yeah
Girls all around the world you should know
It's what we call list hello

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Bad day copped me all a bag full of grade
Anyone could tell you felt bad for me babe
Saturday I was like 'grab me a tray'
And when we're chilling out I'll put badness away
Why? Cause you're my princess
If you heard I had a shootout you weren't impressed
But, chill out everything's bless
And she's got my meal out and my tings pressed (UUMMM)
Ima invest, in your love's own general interest
And I'm always in debt for keeping me in check
You know everything best
No telling my luck, I ain't giving a fuck
You're iced out with a delicate touch
And you keep my intelligence up
And God knows I ain't giving you up

[Chorus: Didz]
Girls all around the world you should know
It's for us to win your soul, oh yeah
Girls all around the world you should know
It's what we call list hello

[Outro: Didz]
Girls all around the world (x4)
