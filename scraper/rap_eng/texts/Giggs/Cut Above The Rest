[Intro: Giggs]

Boom Productions

Yeah

Giggs, Shola Ama

Yeah

Ahhh

Boom Productions

Let me just

[Verse 1: Giggs & Shola Ama]

Brushin' up my swagger (yes)
Hollowman had to reach out to Shola Ama (jheez)
It's a picture moment, someone grab a camera
Moving presidential, like Barack Obama (mm)
And we make shit seem clear like when your TV goes fuzzy and you grab a hanger
And no matter how I dress women love my swagger yes
Step in lookin' hot
Feelin' like a cut above the rest
I know you, and you know me (yeah)
Might plant a little kiss on your rose cheek
I won't beat, let you go sleep
Disappear into the night like [?]
Hollowman keeps it low-key
My low jeans hanging off my arse looking Dolce
My flow [?] havin' women after my whole team
I know she loves me from the heart when she holds me

Baby
Talkin' all the time like they know me
But they don't really know nothin' 'bout me
Cos I be cut above the rest
You know it baby
Stop, look, listen and learn
The original diva, ain't you heard?
Nothin' gonna stop it, no you know I ain't movin' cos I've paid my dues and I'm..

[Chorus: Shola Ama]

I'm a cut above, I'm a cut above the rest
I'm a cut above, no one can do it like this
I'm a cut above, I'm a cut above the rest
I'm a cut above, no one can do it like this
No one can do it like this
No one can do it like this
No they can't do it like this
No one can do it like this

[Verse 2: Giggs & Shola Ama]

No one can do it like Giggs
Cut above the rest
Just cut another cheque
Fuck a lovers tiff babe
Cut a brothers dress
Not another breathe
Get the loving sex
Put the covers all back for another sesh (Mmm)
You know our loving gets
Babe your body's all that and I love your sex
What, tell your friend to call back, Imma buss a sweat cos
You know just how freaky all the touching gets

I'm on fire
Just let me sing my song like lala
[?] we gotta stop, it'll kill ya
You're fearless
Don't try to hide it, we can't deny it baby
Stop, look, listen and learn
The original diva has returned
Beautiful music, that's the only thing that I'm doing
You know I give it to ya cos I'm...

[Chorus: Giggs & Shola Ama]

I'm a cut above, I'm a cut above the rest
I'm a cut above, no one can do it like this
I'm a cut above, I'm a cut above the rest
I'm a cut above, no one can do it like this
No one can do it like this
No one can do it like this
No they can't do it like this
No one can do it like this
No one can do it like Giggs
