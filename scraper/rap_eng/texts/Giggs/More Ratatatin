[Verse 1: Giggs]
This the captain round here, got some stacks around him
So keep it quiet, lower caption round him
Tell him grab a baseball bat and get it wrapped around him
Stamp that fucker out and wrap them Max around him
Cause he's got some prats around him and some straps around him
Some niggas think they're bad, they're Michael Jackson round him
Let's talk about the facts and how these prats are drowning
They bought it similar, they thought familiar
So I came HD, then I brought it cinema
An acquired taste like salt and vinegar
Yeah, they brought it chilled, but I brought it chillier
When a man like me walks in, I'm with big Jud, dat's inua
When a man like me walks in, niggas best walk in similar
Niggas like me don't forfeit, niggas just light that Rizla
Quickly go and pop that cork, quick, grab on that lights and tickle her
I kinda like that kid, I've got a vibe, got wickeder
I didn't like that chick, I can't lie, I got sick of her
And then the life kicked in, I can't lie, I got pickier
It's time to wipe that grin, and now my life got prettier
I'm in a blacked-out whip, but got the white interior
You man are talking Ps, but in a bright insignia
Yeah we're the silent Gs, we're gonna ride, bring Syria
A little light sixteen, these little guys just trivia

Mr MAC and Speshy, Mr Slap a TECCy
If they disrespect, shit will get massive messy
They thought that strap would mek it round the back of Pecky?
MAC, I mek it rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Slap dat, cat nap, cat nap, cat nap, cat nap
I think it was Carlton, madman, young Taz, Mad Max
Man banged on them, bang bang, they say man ran Black Gang
When man brang "Cat Dragged", jack that, jack that, jack that, jack that
When a man like me walks in, niggas like "yo, Giggs, big him up"
When a man like me walks in, niggas like "yo, six figures, cuz"
Niggas like us, no talking, niggas invite those bigger jugs
Niggas gon' eat, stick forks in, niggas don't know this nigga, cuz
