[Verse]
Who's that? Who's that?
Who's that? Who?
It's that, it's that
It's that dude
Steppin' out in flip flops
Steppin' out in flip flops
Man can smell the high grade
Poppin out the zip lock (jheeze)
Via phone call
Rolled up, goons
Who's that? Who's that?
What's that? Boom
Poppin' out the 45
Man are getting slapped up
If man ah got their backs up
Man are getting backed up
Every minute talking
Better get your cash up
If I got the burger
Coming for the catch up
Man, I want the sachets
And I want the pasta (everything)
If I'm gonna ghost man
Coming for it Casper
Man are body catcher
Man are body snatcher
You can keep on tweeting
Man are gonna catch ya
Fuck a Ninja Turtle
Pussy nigga Baxter
Man are getting work now
I'm the manufacturer (yes)
Used to have the white girl
Man was in the tractor
Nigga, that was old school
That's a Maggie Thatcher
Push it in the Pro Tool
Sugar with the caster
Pussy in Atlanta
Pussy in Alaska
Man was in the party
Man was in the party
DJ Ghost
Spend a Maserati
Man forget the old days
Banging with the [?]
Take it back to the future
Swagger was a Marty
Stepped in
Swammy with a darky
Turned around and said 'fuck this'
And handed her the car key
Then we quick linked up Brenda
Madeline and Marcie
Hammer the Courvoisi
Straddlin'-

[Outro]
Man was gonna say straddlin' her arse in
Oh, shit
