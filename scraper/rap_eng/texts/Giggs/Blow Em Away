[Verse 1: Giggs & Shola Ama]

Yeah

Giggs, Shola Ama, DaVinChe on the beat

I've been smashin' up the game since I left jail (jail)
First the coke game, I can say it went well (yes)
Skip past a couple years, let me excel
Still an SN1 G but I'm with XL (Mmm)
Me and Shola made Cut Above The Rest, the first time that I showed my girlfriend I think she went pale
We left it then it went stale (stale)
Hollered at DaVinChe, now I sense sales
My events sell, out, ni**a, I drive the Benz well (Mmm)
Man on fire, lookin' like I'm Den-zel (yeah)
And mad attire, compliments the scent smell (jheez)
Mad on fire, and on a 1-to-10 scale, my swags up higher, 11-out-of-10 still (oooh)
I told â€˜em I'm excellent like Ted and his friend Bill

Oh yeah I see it, a premonition, you and I know the world is our oyster babe
Better believe it, we on a mission
You and I, we been makin' waves through the game
A little focus, a lot of potential
We got this sewn' up, watch how we blowin' up

[Chorus: Giggs & Shola Ama]
We smokin' game now, watch how we blow 'em away
Wouldn't mind blowin' music that be blowin' the brain
Smokin' the game now, watch how we blow 'em away
You can't tell me that you didn't notice the rave
We smokin' game now, watch how we blow 'em away
We been smokin' the game, we got it smokin' again
Smokin' the game now, watch how we blow 'em away
Blowin' away the game

[Verse 2: Giggs & Shola Ama]
Swagger through the roof-tops, new Sox hat on my head match my new top
A true top, suttin' that I got from my new shop
Unforgivable aftershave, spray a few drops
I remember when a ni**a used to move rocks
Now my dirty money's turned clean, called it Nuke 1 (Mmm)
So f**k a new job, keep my sh*t real hard, I don't do pop

They know the name and heard the stories
There's a whole lot written in my history
Remember days and all the glory
They callin' out 'cause they wanna see me do it again
No more waitin', I'm losin' my patience
I got this sewn up, Giggs and Sho we blowin' up, hey

[Chorus: Giggs & Shola Ama]
We smokin' game now, watch how we blow 'em away
Wouldn't mind blowin' music that be blowin' the brain
Smokin' the game now, watch how we blow 'em away
You can't tell me that you didn't notice the rave
We smokin' game now, watch how we blow 'em away
We been smokin' the game, we got it smokin' again
Smokin' the game now, watch how we blow 'em away
Blowin' away the game

[Outro: Shola Ama]
Oh, oh, we gon' blow 'em away, blowin' away the game
Oh, oh, we gon' blow 'em away, blowin' away the game
Oh, oh, we gon' blow 'em away, blowin' away the game
Oh, oh, we gon' blow 'em away
