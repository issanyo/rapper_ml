[Verse]
If you're talkin' the hardest
Giggs better pop up in your thoughts as an artist (Jheeze)
Taunting the market
Everybody wants to know where Walk in da Park is
Walk in the party, sporting Armani
Half of the crowd's all snorting my Charlie
Sorted the bar, time to sort the punani
Chicks looking at me like "Talk to me darling" (Jheeze)
Hollering at man
Winking, smiling and wanna attack man
I think these lighties loving my Black Gang
Everyone's suit same colour as Batman's
Flipping like a quarter a brick
Bag 28 with a thought of a jib
Anybody thinks they can talk to my clique
Will end up covered in red like a portion of chips (UUMMM)
Pour me a drink
Big fur jacket, that's the thoughts of a pimp
I used to be quiet, did that sort anything?
So I had to run riot when I bought me a ting
Walk with my ting, peddling morphine
Dem times dere I was licking out more green
Skip couple years, '07 the story
Now I'm Hollowman in some heavy Dior jeans (UUMMM)
Bitch niggas lookin' for glory
Wanna beef me so they can tell you a story
It'll get bloody and it'll get gory
Clapped in the neck like Amanda in Saw 3
Yeah I got my suttin' deh pon me
So much straps I'll have a weaponry orgy
Feds try nick me for a murder
But it could've been the man that had the weapon before me
B, white, green, I been peddling all three
Dropped P a box, it was just under 4G (jheeze)
I told her weigh the 10s at 2 grams
And weigh the 8ths about 4g
Badman's on the block
Spender, Young Giggs, Mantis and Rockz
TB, Tinie, Carlton and Jim Jones
Holding it down while they handle the clock (my niggas)
Pussyholes got my mandem on lock
Straps, we handle a lot
Clapped your mandem and what?
Me and you are cool but you can stand there and watch
My PYGs will put their hands on your watch
Be easy, I'll put your mans in a box
Young Lap, TB, JJ and Shockz
I treat my little niggas like fam, not a boss (UUMMM)
All my mandem are hot
But your mandem are washed
Beat couple shots and you ran to the cops
Big .45, they couldn't handle the shock
I talk about that handgun a lot
But that one, Hollowman handles a lot
All the Black Gang fam are handled a lot
Me and Foss bagging up grams at the spot
Shots in my grind gear, jumped in my vehicle
All gassed up, now I'mma slang me a rock (UUMMM)
Hollowman handles his job
Feds on the ground, helicopters on top
Beautiful women wanna dock to my cot
A beautiful woman wouldn't stop getting cock
