[Chorus]
It ain't a problem for me man
We bang
It ain’t a problem for me man, me man
We bang

[Verse 1]
Spare No 1's hardest beasts
Other rappers better get their brushes out 'cause this is a masterpiece
And I’ve been hitting them hard for weeks
'Til a nigga's having nighmares and they're finding it hard to sleep
You other rappers ain't hard as me
Anybody you think's nice, better put them after me
That's why you niggas talk shit and laugh at me
Plotting and scheming like Dick Dasterdly
I'm a real gangbanger that blasts his heat
Straight up action, I hardly speak
Niggas don’t do half the shit they preach
That’s the big difference between these niggas and me
I've been through shit you won’t believe
Don't a lot of dirt with my nine so it's hardly clean
Never let me down, that's a classy piece
Fuck you soft niggas that wear your hearts on sleeves

[Chorus]
It ain’t a problem for me man
We bang
It ain't a problem for me man, me man
We bang

[Verse 2]
'Lotta niggas pissed with my music
And pushing up their face more now
Cause they heard me on blue shit
But it's nothing 'cause I copped couple new sticks
I swear to God, so you pussy niggas get off my pubics
You can't fuck with the true clique
And now they're on some Cinderella shit, tryna see if the shoe fits
SN1's who I move with
Nigga that's Kyze, Trigs, oh I can't forget Joe Griz
I'm hitting these rappers with full force
And I've been listening to your raps, and your lyrics are all false
I'm pushing these faggots right off course
And there's nothing you can do, 'cause you faggots got no balls
That's why you snitches get the law called
Sit back and smile while looking at the stunts that the law pulled
Then they wonder how I got so nice
'Cause I've been sitting down a hot minute, looking at four walls

[Chorus]
It ain't a problem for me man
We bang
It ain't a problem for me man, me man
We bang
