[Verse 1]
Looking at my troubled life
Thinking if the grass looks greener on the other side
And God knows that my mother tried
With me myself Hollowman, and my brother Grind
And I'm thinking 'bout the gutter times
Peanut butter jam, one bread, and a butter knife
That's no fucking lie
Lost Big Lee, and I felt like my brother died
Some would say I'm a lucky guy
I'm 26 they thought I wouldn't make it to 25
And I know niggas hate, I'm a heavy guy
But if they wanna snake me I'll take it to any heights
Take me on any ride
Got a full clip, there's no space in my semi nine
And I'm impatient and very hyped
Putting them to sleep, motherfuckers say your beddy byes
And I'm racing to better my life, fam I set a time
I ain't talking 'bout the bass with the treble type
Fam I'm talking 'bout the base that you pebble grind
God, don't forsake me for getting mine
'cos I know I'm doing great in the devil's eyes
This is blatantly petty crime
Throw me down a contract, let me get it signed

[Hook] (x2)
I'm caught up where the fat black hammers out
Pecknarm, black bandana town
Slap that banger round
Clap that faggot down

[Verse 2]
The pain in my head says that my life's messed
I ain't far from my death bed
Blade says as I lay down on my bedspread
Pestered by my lifestyle and my friend's deaths
Feds locked everyone down, got no friends left
Carlton I had a breakdown from your twen' stretch
My end said nigga slow down from my head stress
I said yes, never slowed now need my head checked
Think back to the playground, only ten then
Ten years later spraying rounds on your end's set
I then kept hearing loose talks, couple sent threats
My friends crept on the said pest soon as Spend said
The real shit that I lay down shows my end's rep
The deep shit that I write down shows my pen's depth
Wanna take it to the next step
I'm a street sweeper, get your ends swept
The feds dressed in the plain clothes where my set rests
The next step's to get some info, where the Tec's kept
My best bet is to lay low so I rested
My head's wet 'cos the hydro got molested
Promoters on the fed's dick
Went and banned me from the show, they're against it
But I sensed it, fucker showed the roads where my strength is
Made a new flow and I went sick
Nigga fuck the five-oh, little bent pricks
Bunch of fucking homos, and your stench whiffs
And the haters rolling round in their rent whips
Rolled up on me and I sent six
You won't see me on some fence shit
Niggas know I'm straight 'Narm when my strength kicks
And my ends is coming out of every other end's lips
And in every mouth like a dentist

[Hook] (x2)
I'm caught up where the fat black hammers out
Pecknarm, black bandana town
Slap that banger round
Clap that faggot down
