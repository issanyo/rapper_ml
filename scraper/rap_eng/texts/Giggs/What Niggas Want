[Verse 1: Giggs]
Niggas diss me, then they nick me
Well I'm back you fuckers, did you miss me?
This is history, if I cock back
And slap that nigga, will three-sixty
I'm back with swagga nigga, bout to swagga niggas
On my Fred Flintstone, yabba-dabba niggas
All you faggot niggas when we get to grabbin' niggas
We'll be slappin' up niggas, na we'll be taggin' niggas
I wasn't bragging niggas
They said they reached to my level, but yet you haven't niggas (what have you all been doin'?)
You'd better get your ladder niggas (and climb up to the top)
They're plannin' to the death, bang it till they're dead
That 'ahhh' ad-lib, pan it to the left
That big 4-5 brang him to his legs
That last slug swam into his bed

[Hook: Giggs]
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
What niggas want, what niggas want
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
Yeah this is what niggas want, what niggas want
What niggas want, what niggas want

[Verse 2: Giggs]
We put plenty through them when we sent it to them
We got big straps, nigga we won't 22 them
Got the big chalices, blowin' sensi through them
Man I been locked up before, I was 22 then
I'm back from karma, bitch, back for drama bitch
Pack your armour, bitch, fat banana clips
I wrap bananas, bitch, rap's Obama, prick
This that Mortal Kombat, stab Kitana shit
Fat punani chick
Knockin' at my door, I'm on my silk black pyjama shit
And we about to go to war like the Gaza Strip
Aussie accent, I call that jezzy my koala chick
Yeah I slapped at niggas, not a batch-a niggas
Get this back to niggas, I'm comin' back for niggas
The second chapter niggas, please don't let me catch them niggas
Or it's a wrap for niggas, I brought it back for niggas

[Hook]
