[Verse]
I've returned on the hit
Cah Big Ryde told me I should jump back on it on some murderous shit
Whatever you'd prefer me to spit
Turn on a disc while I burn on a spliff
Motherfuckers know that I'm 'bout it
I don't do coward bullshit like shooting at houses
Cuz I'm on some military shooting it out shit
Colt .45's what I'll be moving around with
And we don't keep our shooters in pouches
I keep it in my pocket I'll be pulling it out quick
Don't doo-doo your trousers
Swagger is emotional, nigga I've got numerous outfits
There's no point cruising around
If you ain't got now Hollowman music around
It's Big Ryde, Hollowman cruising the town
With shooters around me, don't shoot off your mouth b
My little brother Spen's got shooters around
He's short tempered he'll maneuver your Audi
There's nothing stupid about me
We're polluting the town b
Jail niggas cop my CD on a town v
Hollowman and Blade sold serious amounts
We drop, bombs blew, now there's a serious drought b

[Outro] (x2)
Nigga this is Hollowman
The real niggas are Hollow fans
You niggas know what Hollow plans
And niggas know that Hollow bangs
