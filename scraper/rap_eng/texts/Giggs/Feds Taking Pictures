[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah, Giggs
Blade, Hollowman, it's nothing
Spare
SN1 all day, SWAT
Yeah

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Me?
Top gangbanger
Me, Knuckz, Spen, rolling in some wack banger
Baseball cap and hammer
Black bandana
And we ain't happy that we're gunning
I was happy in my yard practically buzzing
Now I'ma get some practise while I'm bucking
30 minutes after Knuckz phoned me for the suttin'
I be on some major fire breaking
Everybody ducking, couple faces on the pavement
Bleeding like a bitch, mum's crying in the station
But that's the consequences of a major violation
Once I get the engine started I'm off
Paranoid, hit my destination, park in the block
Now I'm thinking 'bout my karma with God
But when I link back with my niggas, we'll be laughing it off
Fam I'm moving sick and always have been
Still fucking over niggas now, but ain't a has-been
Always on a madting
Way before straps, violated me I grabbed him
And stabbed him
Fam I don't business 'bout you dumb rookies
Bitch niggas from you popped outta your mum's pussy
If you touch Boogie, you will get bun fully
Victim of the slug that I shoved in the gun pussy

[Verse 2: Blade Brown]
Man are still picking up O's of cro, man that's worthless
Catch me on the phone giving orders to the workers
You be on the block with the clowns and the actors
Catch me on the roads with the ballers and the merkers
And yeah we've got that barley flake
So peng I swear, make 'em do the Harlem Shake
I've got the heart of a lion
I'll bark off the nine for my partner in crime
The block's hot and the hood's fire
And these bitch niggas are some good liars
They're always lying to themselves
Never bussin' off the iron, it's always lying on the shelf
This is a joke ting for fuck sakes
This industry's full up of clowns and cupcakes
No time for niggas who be moving bait
I'm on the grind, got figures to accumulate

[Outro: Joe Grind]
Damn
Giggs, Blade, Joe Grind
I weren't even on this man, I just wanna get credit
This tune's a fucking banger
Can't bang like this, so don't even fucking try
Spare
You niggas know the work we do man
Banging shit
Bang, gang
Damn fam
