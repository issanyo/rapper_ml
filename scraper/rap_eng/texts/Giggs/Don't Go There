[Hook: B.o.B]
Well, people gon' be people, ain't nobody gon' change
We can keep it peaceful if we leave it the same if
Don't go there, don't go there
Don't go there, no don't go there
People gon' be people, ain't nobody gon' change
We can keep it peaceful if we leave it the same
If you don't go there, don't go there
Don't go there, no don't go there

[Verse 1: Giggs]
You don't know where, where my people coming from
Cause you don't go there, we're just try'na get dough here
Feds on our case so we're moving mad low here
Yeah, but shit's moving mad slow here
Brown went dead so I invested in coke shares
I started seeing shit so clear, all courtesy of a coke square
And we gotta keep a strap in the house
Cause we the niggas that bragging black gang in the south
So what's these other niggas yapping about
Talk shit around here, get a slap in the mouth
Niggas know me, I always swagga it out
The True Religion jeans might be matching the Ralph
But seeing is believing cause I'm smashing them out

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I'm try'na make this rap shit work
Cause I'm getting tired of the moving packed shift work
So let me rap a quick spliff first then link B.o.B
Then I slap a quick sick verse
I'm fed up of trapping, I'm disturbed
Rapping these packets and bagging this shit dirt
So tell me what the fucks all this shit worth
Rollin with niggas that back it and pitch nerds
You think I wanna be on this shooter shit
But niggas hate and money is the root of it
And if a nigga wants to try and merk me
And I got the strally on me, I'ma shoot this shit
That's my life and I'm used to it
Yeah, I know that's some stupid shit
But if you don't go there keep it peaceful
It might die down a little bit so let my people live

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
No oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Outro: B.o.B]
No, don't go there, oh oh
Don't go there, oh oh
Don't go there, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
