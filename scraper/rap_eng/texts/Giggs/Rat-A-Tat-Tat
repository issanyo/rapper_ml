[Intro: Giggs]
Simple
Giggs, Kyze
SN1 from top to bottom
All day
Ay Kyze
Warm it up for me fam

[Verse 1: Kyze]
When I catch you in your ends, I'm gonna rip you up
If I catch you in the dance, I'm gonna kick you up
When I run up in your house, it's best you give it up
When I'm feeling low, riding gets my spirit up
Niggas think they know Kyze, but they don't know nuttin'
Hurry get the suttin', turn them into curry mutton
Tried to pitch some guys, missed a couple times
Had to slap myself - someone needs to fucking die
All I've been thinking bout is money needs to get earned
But put the trap on pause, something needs to get burned
My head will not turn, I'm loyal to a hot firm
Plus I'm extra pissed the Ds just locked Termz
Little dickhead youts, don't they know I'm old school?
And I ain't hiding like you fam, I'm local
Dickheads are gassed up, tryna amp their vocals
Tone it down, me and my gun are anti-social
Them man are so fool, but I'm so cool
Them man ain't gangster, nah they're just so called
These little bitches are so small, driving the getaway whip and I won't stall
Roll up and I won't talk
Jump out, go nuts with the blowtorch
Get caught fam, I won't talk
Even from a mad case that I won't walk

[Hook: Giggs]
Rat-dag-a-dag-a-dat-dat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
When I clap little brats best scat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
Rat-dag-a-dag-a-dat-dat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
When I clap little brats best scat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Coming from deep in the jungle, Hollowmans got heat but I'm humble
Niggas say I don't speak, I just mumble
I don't need to speak, teeth got a gunfull
You've been easily rumbled, let my something go brat get a lungfull
I'll even squeeze at your uncle, motherfuckers gone bleed when they tumble
You ain't heard shit from this nigga yet
How much more greezy can a nigga get?
Pass me the weed and the cigarette
Niggas gone go nuts when I hit them next
Kyzer, yes one of my main men
Niggas say I bad him up, but they hating
And Hollowman doesn't rate them
Them same dickheads, there Kyze will blaze them
I just gave him a strap, he's like "Amen"
Gave him the mac, and he sprayed ten
Take boys and I make men, make noise in your fake ends
Spray toys at your fake friends
Niggas don't like me but wanna make friends
And that's the wave of a snake ends, and that's the way that the game ends

[Hook: Giggs]
Rat-dag-a-dag-a-dat-dat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
When I clap little brats best scat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
Rat-dag-a-dag-a-dat-dat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
When I clap little brats best scat, Rat-tat-a-tat-a-tat-tat
