[Intro: Dubz]
Yeah, these niggas ain't on this ting
Nah, not at all
Dubz, Giggs
Not on dis ting, nah they're not on dis ting
Spare No 1, C.R.E.A.M
Doing this ting, on dis ting fully

[Verse 1: Dubz]
Who am I blood?
Mixed race, screwface, two face
Squeeze baller guys like toothpaste
Do or die blood!
That's the motto the real niggas'll feel me
The fake niggas'll not show, love
'Cause they know that we're gangster
And if they know the mash ain't here
Then they know that the shanks are
Step close then I poke up your man, cha
Getting dough is the focus of my gang, brah
That's we roll on 'em, hold 'em in the van
And let this likkle nigga know that we're going to the bank
Let him hear the sound from the Heckler & Kosch
It's going down when we pepper your spot
It's going down, but I ain't Yung Joc
Walk it out, don't talk it out, let that gun pop
Pop, let that gun pop
But only if it's necessary, get them funds dog

[Chorus: Dubz + Giggs]
Who am I, blood?
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Do or die blood!
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Who am I, blood?
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Do or die blood!
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Rolling a spliff
Yeah the food for my brain, 'cause I'm 'bout to zone out in a bit
With Boomblast controlling the hit
Niggas know what it is
And niggas know how we roll in this bitch
Shotting the press
If I got a strally in the car, better know I ain't stopping for feds
What the fuck got up in your head?
'Cause if I'm popping the lead
Shit'll get worse than a hospital bed
Fuck the rest of them, I roll with the best of men
Me and the 9mm are best of friends
You keep talking 'bout your young guns
Fam I've got Young Guns too, like Emilio Estevez
And I ain't going back, nah fuck a prison
I don't rave without my strap, I ain't fucking slipping
Last nigga fucked around with Hollowman got something in him
Thought he was a G, got capped, now he fucking isn't
Load the shit up then I rinse it all
Plus I've got my gloves on, so there ain't no prints at all
Yeah the reason might be petty, but niggas know this
I rinsed that motherfucker 'cause of principal
Talk from the heart, and I don't need to talk when I bark
That ain't even in my thoughts when I spark
And I ain't even trying anymore
So my next mixtape, I'm calling 'Walk In Da Park'
Motherfuckers know I get my mash on
Masked up, black bandana any fucking hat on
Ain't no time for talking, turn the Mac on
The way blood's gonna run
You can say it's time to turn the tap on
You can say my violent side is back on
Tell them motherfuckers that the genocide is back on
Gather up my soldiers and my straps
And tell them fucking riders that it's time for us to crack on

[Chorus: Dubz + Giggs]
Who am I, blood?
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Do or die blood!
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Who am I, blood?
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
Do or die blood!
They ain't on dis, they ain't on dis
Niggas ain't on dis ting
