[Verse 1]
Bruv, don't hold back
Love, don't show that
I used to show love in the hood
But the same love never got shown back
So I got my own gat
Off my own back
I had my own back
Squeezed off a lot, that's why they got my phone tapped
If I squeeze off the lead, take off half of your leg
It won't grow back
Now I've got my own gang
Knuckz, Spen, niggas know man
The way my mind works, it might go blank
'Cause you ain't talking paper so it won't programme
I'm a grown man
Southside dopeman

[Chorus]
Don't let me test out the nine
It's me and my niggas that stretch out the crime
So don't step outta line
Don't step outta line
Don't let me test out the nine
It's me and my niggas that stretch out the crime
So don't step outta line
Don't step outta line

[Verse 2]
Clap, don't pet no
Rap, straps, I can get those
And don't stress hoes
You wanna sit around paperless and get blows
Nigga get dough
Then you'll get the best clothes
You know my dress code
Armani jeans, switch the light off the threads glow
Pecknarm, that's my set yo
Been repping Pecknizzy from the get go
Mets know, sets know, Pecks don't, pet no, nonsense
Load up a fresh load and let go
Break your ankle that's connected to your leg bone
Niggas know we're the hardest, even vets know
I can hear it in their headphones
I'ma spit it like a Tec blows

[Chorus]
Don't let me test out the nine
It's me and my niggas that stretch out the crime
So don't step outta line
Don't step outta line
Don't let me test out the nine
It's me and my niggas that stretch out the crime
So don't step outta line
Don't step outta line
