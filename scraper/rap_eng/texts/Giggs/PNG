[Intro]
GA

[Chorus: Kojo Funds]
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah

[Verse 1: Kojo Funds]
Creep for the night
With th bali on
When we ride
It's another gone
Got shooter's on sight
Tec for the go
So don't hide, you ain't built for this road
Crops been cut up
Another one sold
Hit mans whip up
And take a man's soul
Yards get spun up
And take a man's crow
Beef don't squash
Don't call a man's phone
Free my niggas on the wing uh
Free my bruddas locked in the bin uh
Yeah I know I'm a sinner
Lord forgive me if I rinse my spinner
Yeah
Call me David Blaine
I can make him go away
No face, no case
Send that pussy back to space
We confide
Yes the wap just light it
When we ride
We don't do no fighting

[Chorus: Kojo Funds]
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Man run out
Man get bun out
Dun out the whole strap
Get dash out
Man get flung out
Man brung out the old Mac
Man swung out a blow back hundreds
Then a man run out and throw rats
All day sun out
There's no nuts ring-ring
Then the phone run out of phone batt'
You got your gun out
Shots got rung out
Man hung out the whole batch
Man bun out her the whole patch
They got strung out the no match
Man run out and go
Lets fuck that, I'm up like Remi
I'm Joe Crack
Run out and throw cash
Man so flashy
I'm so flash
Man got it lock 365
Show time
Man pop it off, 350 live
Man steppin' in with 50 guys
Yep-yep
That big boss that rit the rhymes
Man's kicking off the big surprise
Man got the ball and kicked to Kyze
Man got the spud and flipped to fries
And Iâ€™ve been Giggs
That's it, goodbye
Nah wait
I'm back to fly London
Next thing I know it's mad Dubai
Gone to November
Back July
Gone from the Freeview back to Sky
Man met his matches-matches
I like that
Man get the matches
Flash your light
Man's kicking back with that tonight
Cause that kitty cat just catched my eye

[Chorus: Kojo Funds]
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah
Ooh eh-eh-eh-ay
Me no play no games, yeah
.45, 35's in the ride
You don't wanna come this way, yeah
