[Intro: Stefflon Don]
Only pretty women in my kitchen
Money stay looking like digits
Don't compare me to no motherfucking gimmick nigga
Compare me to them niggas that be winning
Black rings black Range she a killer
Big brown bloodclart batty for your dinner

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
Some gyal ah hype, but dem nuh look right
'Nuff talk but dem nuh fight
Say dem a rapper, but them cyaan write
Use microwave but can't cook rice
Belly fat, belly mark up
If him cheat, yo the pussy caw-caw
But when me click me finger like Erup
A cocky fi ah send up in that pussy till it buck
Cocky fi ah send up in that pussy till it buck
Pussy it till it buck, pussy till it buck

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Pussy nigga
Musty like it's Star Wars
I'm a motherfucking Wookie, nigga
Man just in the kitchen and I'm cooking, nigga
Man'll beat the pussy if it's bushy, nigga
Nuttin' ere ain't pussy nuttin' mushy, nigga
Man a keep it Danny keep it Whoopie, nigga
Man'll get a kicking and a whooping, nigga
Man a cookie monster in the cookie, nigga
Wild stacks, wild racks
About that, loudpack
Mad straps, niggas got the mad macs
Step in looking Mad Max
Fam I'm talkin' shottas nigga, mad macs
Man let go the pump and got a bad back
Man'll get it jumping nigga, that's that
Used to have that buju buju crack crack
Man ain't with the sizzle sizzle chat chat
Man'll let it bluku bluku blat blat
Man ain't with the Twitter shit and that's @
When I make it blick, niggas scat scat [?]
When I get to tickling that black cat
Man'll make it giggle, nigga, that's facts
Shining through the battle
Bloodclart diamonds from Seattle

[Hook: Stefflon Don]
Diamonds in my Roley, diamonds, diamonds in my Roley
Diamonds in my Roley, diamonds, diamonds in my Roley

[Verse 3: Stefflon Don]
Ah who di gyal inna di bloodclart Benz?
Hair pon fleek and the pussy pon ten
Pretty like sweets pretty like the weekend
Man haffi ave 'nuff money fi ah spend
Come again
I be all a real nigga need
Real ting five four never play the backseat
Tell a real nigga that I got real nigga needs
All my real dons scream "this pussy ain't free!"
Trapping, trapping I was getting it
East side, I be repping it
I got a hundred bitches and they super fit
Curry mutton on the pepper ting
I tell a nigga that he better marry it
Beat it up and then carry it
Diamonds on my Roley glistening
Diamonds on your Roley mannequin challengin' bitch

[Bridge: Stefflon Don]
Don't compare me to no motherfucking gimmick nigga (bitch)
Don't compare me to no motherfucking gimmick nigga (bitch)
Don't compare me to no motherfucking gimmick nigga
Big brown bloodclart batty for ya dinner

[Outro: Stefflon Don]
Some gyal ah hype, but dem nuh look right
'Nuff talk but dem nuh fight
Say dem a rapper, but them cyaan write
Use microwave but can't cook rice
Pussy too good to fuck for free
Pussy too good to fuck for free
Pussy too good to fuck for free
Yo, this pussy too good to fuck for free!
