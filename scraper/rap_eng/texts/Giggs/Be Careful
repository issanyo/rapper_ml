[Verse 1] (x2)
Be careful
Got the big ting here and it's a rare tool
We'll air fool (UUMMM)
And who dare calls
Hollowman chatting shit on my mobile phone
I wouldn't dare fool
Took a scarce pull, jumped in my vehicle
Etienne-Ozeki outfit and my Air Force
Yeah you better check it out bitch
It's the second outfit
Made your jezzy's mouth fit
On my hairy balls

[Verse 2]
Be scared fool
'Cause my plate's empty it ain't near full
And I'm near you
Look fam to be fair you
And your bredrin's cool ima spare you (jheeze)
I'm a breh who looks at the game through a rear view
Got a white brick, call it 'square food'
Fresh trim? My picky afro is my hairdo
My fur jacket ever comes out? I'll get a rare new
Took couple brehs to
One mansion rave it was tearful
The way them yats behave it would scare you
And I saw everything live I've got a clear view
Hollowman so lyrical
On your visual, there's no-one to compare him to (UUMMM)
