Stop assuming
I was in the trap, nigga, the trap was booming
I was back and forth and smashing racks and moving
Mr. 3 for 50 just came back from Susan's
Just came back from Reuben's, 50 in the wall
Came but they was gone, I've just came back from losing
Dropped some off to Bexley, dropped some off to Lewisham
Gotta pass through Junction, just came back from Tooting
When I came out of jail, I was actually fuming
Said I wouldn't do all the gang shit, now I'm back to gooning
Circumstances, them straps are shooting
Thank God for this rap shit, yeah, the rap was soothing
So I said OK, and it's back to music
Now I'm still in the trap, but still wrapped up units
I dropped Walk in da Park, got banned from the radio
Then I went jail again, but now I'm back to do this
Yeah, me and the mandem had a fallout
But forget that, me and the mandem's cool now
Took a break from the story
To let you know me and them man there ball out
Me and XL parted
Ahh yeah, that's right, me and XL parted
I was at Richard's last night
To let you know, me and dem man still parring
Big bad Hollowman, yeah, dem man still barring
UK rap scene, yeah, dem man still starring
The mandem starting, the madness started
Them mental show racks, so fuck what's charted
Smash up one track, they're um and ah-ing
I smash a next one, they're Pecky-narming
That kamikaze and camouflaging
He hollers now and man'll charge him
Flexing, flexing, flexing, flexing, flexing
I just dropped this album cause it's actually destined
How much for that fester? Just got racks from festin
I just hit the club and man bought [?] in
I just spoke to Ronson, just sent CAS a message
Where I'll be tomorrow? Question marks and guesses
She sent that request and she sent mad requesses
Shit just took me way back to my adolescence

[Outro]
I hope you enjoy the rest of the show
