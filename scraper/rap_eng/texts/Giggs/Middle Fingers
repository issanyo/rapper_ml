[Chorus: Waka Flocka]
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas x2

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Niggas put your middle finger up now
All you other pussy niggas duck down
Nigga put your middle finger up
Get the ringer out ama get them niggas touched
Fuck it ama fill em up
Man will turkey niggas ama get them niggas stuffed
When its dinner time, and we let them spinners frost
Pass it over here ama show you how to swing a ?
Getting money so a nigga stunt
Check my bank account you see how them figures jump
Get that alcohol, now a nigga drunk
The realest ones, that am still amongst
Man like jimmy on da rocks dat will spill along
When were on the battle field think them niggas run
So if you wanna dis me better bring a gun

[Chorus: Waka Flocka]
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas x2

[Verse 2: Gunna D]
I'll let it ring out, when that beef calls
Niggas squashing beef like there making meat balls
Fuck peace, I just keep that piece full
Fuck police nigga I don't need rules
Bring the piece like Gandhi, show him to Jesus
Pick up the piece, let them pick up the pieces
Yeah, (Gunna)
Turn your lights off when that nine releases
Like amen, put your lights out on your day in
If I get that low down, I ain't waiting
Let that 3 8th spin
I ain't playin, nigga I don't play
I ain't a pimp but I can make that pussy pay
These niggas playing, but they can't press replay
When I press on the spesh and blow his chest away

[Chorus: Waka Flocka]
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas x2

[Verse 3: Killa Ki]
Niggas rapping good, but cuz they ain't live the lie
I've been in mad beef had to grip ma nine
So fuck your rapping lies, still got a trapping life
Half a box of the duck [?]
This is real nigga music
South London, Pecknarm, trust me we do dis
We grip and we shoot sticks, we trap and we move bricks
Here in the UK, if you never knew this
We beef south from the queens house
Yellow brick blocks, that be the deep south
Peckham Boys, Black Gang, niggas know what we're 'bout
Soon run the rap game cuz I ain't got no doubt

[Chorus: Waka Flocka]
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x3
And scream fuck y'all niggas
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas
Put your middle fingers up x2
Fuck, fuck, fuck y'all niggas x2
