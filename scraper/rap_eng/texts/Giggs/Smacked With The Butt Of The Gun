[Intro: Fix Dot’M]
Uh, we’re gonna steam roll ‘em on this one, real talk
Jheez, Fix, wow, What you don’t know my name?
Fix Dot’M

[Verse 1: Fix Dot’M]
Ah, I can take your pain way
Like Sylar remove your headtop, take your brain away
Fuck a rainy day, cuz I blatantly rave
I was made to stay
I be getting it hard, so I'm spending it, DNA chain
My God, they frozen my blood in my necklace
We roll up, me, buck and eff’ing Giggs
Start dumping, pitch niggas, sever wigs
And if you bitch niggas ever snitch
I've got something that'll take the tip off the Everest
Look, I’ll take the piss out of everything
Spit ‘til the shit click, spit ‘til I’ve emptied it
Slip something out, then slip something in again, raaah
Tooly’ll injure him
This ain’t a movie try picturing
Look, but don't try pitching me
‘cause this shit buss like 63 (get it), come on stick with me
Listen my punches are insane, they drop nice on your ear like an earring
Mind I take you to the streets where I grind work
I can tell you how to eat, not on my turf
Show you how a 9 work
Show you how 1 shot will let a nigga float like an iceberg
Jheez

[Chorus: Giggs & Fix Dot’M]
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Had to get one in your lung
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Had to get one in your lung

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Jheez!
These niggas know my partner, colt 4 fizzy’s my devoted barker
Talked up first, Ima load it after
Have your white tee looking like a squashed “tomatah”
Roll through gaza, phone on charge
Buck boys ringing me, told me park up (skrrt)
Sluts eyes digging me, loads of laughter
Make moves and my pockets will be bulging after
MMM!
Right now Im cane’in the underground
Me, Hollowman, coz I came with another sound
Yea I got straps, but I ain't one of them loud mother fuckers that be waving a gun around
Jheez!
When my shotty raise up, and you spot gets sprayed up
It will make your little pussio posse wake up
I'll lock it and pop it, then blow out, chill out
With a zoobie while sipping convousier cups, ooo
Violent squad, silent shot, and Im fresh of the island what
Walk in a stylish top and the bird on its looking kinda Lyle and Scott, what
Hand on my knife, YG left, Spen stands on the right
And I got my gang on a hype
Rolling round to Movado screaming out “Gangsta Fi Life”

[Chorus: Giggs & Fix Dot’M]
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Had to get one in your lung
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Smacked with the butt of the gun
Had to get one in your lung
