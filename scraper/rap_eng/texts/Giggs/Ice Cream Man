[Verse 1]
I ain't feeling any love
Niggas plotting to merk me
And trust me I feel it in my blood
Believe me I'm a thug
But I'm blessed by the Lord
Think I'm crazy fam I feel it from above
Recognise a G
Through that Up In The Shoobz shit
These niggas started recognising me
But motherfucker don't be pressurising me
Got my pistol side of me
If I lift it that's just exercise for me
I'm running out of punk
Smoked about a nosy 'cos I'm low key
And I ain't coming out for months
But when I start running out on punks
Shells hit your back and coming out your front
Got a blunt to pull
A pumpy tool
Nigga I don't stunt with jewels
Don't let me get that UMP with force
That's a silly fucking stunt to pull

[Chorus]
Niggas like me bang
Rolling in a whitish van
Got the strally in a Nike bag
And I ain't got a icy hand
But the way I talk white
I should be the new ice cream man
Niggas like me bang
Rolling in a whitish van
Got the strally in a Nike bag
And I ain't got a icy hand
But the way I talk white
I should be the new ice cream man

[Verse 2]
You know I keep the toasters packed
Rolling with the loaded mash
Got the strally with the scope and that
These niggas must be smoking crack
'Cause the nose on the Luger is similar to Postman Pat's
If I ever get my foot in the door
All these fake ass rappers I'll be cutting them all off
These niggas ain't bucking their tool off
This rap shit stinks
I'm thinking 'bout fucking it all off
Me and my shooters let lead clap
So you can come around with your dead straps
Squeeze off, take off the head back
(What you think Giggs is real?)
I want to know who the fuck said that
I'm a pistol spraying artist
And the most sophisticated hardest
Get a chance I'ma manipulate the market

[Chorus]
Niggas like me bang
Rolling in a whitish van
Got the strally in a Nike bag
And I ain't got a icy hand
But the way I talk white
I should be the new ice cream man
Niggas like me bang
Rolling in a whitish van
Got the strally in a Nike bag
And I ain't got a icy hand
But the way I talk white
I should be the new ice cream man

[Outro]
Hollow in the booth
Alotta niggas following the yute
Listen to me if you wanna know the truth
Hollow in the booth, Hollow in the booth
Hollow in the booth
Alotta niggas following the yute
Listen to me if you wanna know the truth
Hollow in the booth, Hollow in the booth
