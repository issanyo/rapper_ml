We're not gonna water anything down, except for when I'm raining in little pussy!

[Hook: Giggs]

'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up, 'caine, 'caine in a cut up bag!

'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up bag!
UK we put 'caine in a cut up, 'caine, 'caine in a cut up bag!


[Verse 1: Giggs]

It came in a bag
It came in a slab
She came in a cab (why?)
True the mandem were bait, it came with a slag
Me and Foss all day, 'caine in the grams
From I stepped out of jail, 'caine in my plans
Got the line built up, came with a bang!
It's kinda drastic fam
Break the coke up, wrap it up in plastic bags
Got the cr√®me link
So the heads think
"Jheez Giggsy, that was a fantastic gram!"
Money in elastic bands
Real niggas here, no we ain't a plastic gang
Get your [?] bang
Get your hat click bang
Whole head lighted up like a matchstick man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Giggs]

Got a flake square
On the motorway, 120 all the way there
Foss strapping up the spliffs while I change gear
Rocks slapping on the hits, what's he playing? (Spare!)
Niggas hate cos they know we're making papes here
Getting all stressed out, couple grey hairs
No I ain't scared
Got a lot of big guns in my mate's care
And he takes care
Other niggas ain't strapped, think it ain't fair (wimps)
Tiny Giggs, Tiny Boost, yeah they're rolling with me
That's just something that I thought I should make clear
'caine in a cut up bag!
Tryna get a Range and a fucking Jag!
Are you fucking mad?

[Hook]

Trust me, you know what I want everyone to do right now?
Wind down all your windows, turn this up
Loud, let the bassline bang showing no respect!
No respect for the law!
Get me? Screaming out "'caine in a cut up bag" rags!
