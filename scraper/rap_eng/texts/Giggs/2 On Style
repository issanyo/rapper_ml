[Intro: DJ Big Ryde]
Yac for that one you get me
But H, hear what I'm saying cuz
I need you to switch it up you know
Cah you know you're the man with the flows
It's that new shit, STR8 MURKIN

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yo yo what's up yo it's G here
They told me I'm not supposed to be here (why?)
Just because I might cock that machine there
A hard place and a rock man's between there (for real)
And niggas don't rock no fatigues here
Deep in Pecky you're not supposed to be here
Sheets locked down, we got lots of keys here
Might pop round and Pop Pop then leave there
Site them dudes that love watch but we here
Bare what's goods and what's nots to be fair
Lock man down you think them police care
Love chase man, you think them police fair (nah)
Oh look that's police there
Man keep calm and stash that [?]piece there
Or spin round that's fat bat Patrice there
That milkshake, that's fat cat Kelis there
What, what, what's the low down
Excuse me while I just wipe the throne down
Love that shit that's not supposed to go down
So old school like Michael and Motown
(Ummm!)
They love the way we rock
Quick, open up the lock, don't make me knock
Chicks looking man right now don't make me shot
I'm saying that I am, they say I'm not
Man claim to knew that gang, I'm saying what
You think you that bad, then take a shot
Man caught strap up up at 8 o'clock
Get clapped then you beg man to pay 'em off
I'm not supposed to be 'ere
Man was trappin' I chopped up the b-square
Air Force One's the top match the d-square
Yeah I bought guns and wrapped up a leaf here
Reel up press repeat here
Man's UK we ain't got Phillipe here
Round my way we ain't got to meet here
VIP you ain't got no seats here
RIP we wake up the beats here
Change that part and Saj press delete there
Take that back I got that receipt here
Man's too hot, it's sun, sand and beach here
(Uhh)
They love the way we uhh
Hahaha, get off me
