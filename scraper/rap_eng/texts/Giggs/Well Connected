[Intro]
Yo Skrapz, what we got next?
Ok, whats this the south side of the border shit yeah?
Shouts to my nigga Giggs on this one
Oi Skrapz, whats this Well Connected?
From south side to north west side its all good
Oi Skrapz let them know whats going on fam
Show them how we get down innit, how we roll}


[Verse 1: Skrapz]
Listen, I be switching up my clothes any time i touch the road
Shout my nigga Nines said its time to lock and load
Got these niggas talking tough tryna violate the code
Bout to get themselves smoked, I'm surprised they never know
Niggas talking tough like I wasn't coming home
Like i couldn't get these niggas touched via telephone
Like i couldn't phone my man, tell him go find man, he doesn't ask why, coz i said like Simon
I'm a star boy, I shine bright like a diamond
Sittin in the sun, big gun, fuck Trident
We got blacks killing blacks, kids killing kids, what it is, when's it ever gonna stop? Ask Giggs
Phoned Dris, told him meet me at the spot half 6
It's about to go down and he was like "aaah shit"
If you ever see me in a dinger in your district
Best evacuate the scene, I wouldn't bother risk it

[Chorus]
I just done a madness now I'm sitting in the crib, billing up a kush spliff while I'm listening to Giggs
I'm well connected, niggas know what it is
Big up all my real Gs south side of the bridge
I just done a madness now I'm chillin in the flats, billing up a haze blunt while I'm listening to Skrapz
I'm well connected, what you know about that
Big up all my real Gs north west on the map


[Verse 2: Giggs]
Never wrote this, but I'm dead focused
When a man turn up, every man notice
When you see the strally draw from a man's trousers
Man a turn pussy when I push up man's poses
Man shooters, niggas ain't boxers, niggas ain't out there ducking them copters
Manna make real G niggas see doctors
Fuck a beat boxer, gimme 3 boxes {​Jheeze}​
Toxic, back at man popped it
When will it stop ? When you hear that tick tock shit
Wireless fest I had the posses in moshpits
From that G shit, let them pussies make pop shit
Roll up, niggas get boxed in
Pole up make a man box it
Niggas wanna sting like a bee but mans waspin
Niggas ain't watching, nigga thats watch it!


[Chorus]
I just done a madness now I'm sitting in the crib, billing up a kush spliff while I'm listening to Giggs
I'm well connected, niggas know what it is
Big up all my real Gs south side of the bridge
I just done a madness now I'm chillin in the flats, billing up a haze blunt while I'm listening to Skrapz
I'm well connected, what you know about that
Big up all my real Gs north west on the map

[Verse 3: SKRAPZ]
I make the .45 echo
These niggas wanna rock and roll, they must like heavy metal
I just came home so I'm chilling for a minute
Told my nigga its about to get peak when I settle
Bunnin haze wondering if heavens got a ghetto with a brown skin ting, short skirt and stilletto
Ciroc's got a mellow, whispered in my ear, and started popping off her blouse, had a a nigga like "hello"
I do this for the whole of man's city like Dzeko
I disappeared and now i come back im like Eto'o
I used to push the black benz with the black and white seats
6 gears, told my nigga take time on the pedal
You never ever ever ever see me dancing with the devil
On some outlaw shit, fuck feds, I'm a rebel
Posing for the camera with my kettle
And i ain't tryna slow down
Free my dawgs out the kennel

[Chorus]
I just done a madness now I'm sitting in the crib, billing up a kush spliff while I'm listening to Giggs
I'm well connected, niggas know what it is
Big up all my real Gs south side of the bridge
I just done a madness now I'm chillin in the flats, billing up a haze blunt while I'm listening to Skrapz
I'm well connected, what you know about that
Big up all my real Gs north west on the map
