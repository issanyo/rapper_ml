[Verse: 1]
They say that I'm lucky to be alive
Life's mad hard but fuck it man I survived
And all them haters and suck a nigga's surprise
Fuck that little snake hes no fucking brother of mine
The suffering and the lies
And niggas died just cos they were one of mine
I wanna cry but fuck it man I'm a lion
Ama show niggas exactly what's on the line
Broad day shit niggas bussing it in the light
Bed time strap will be tucking niggas goodnight
You're tussling for your life
Suffocate niggas while cutting off their supply
I might smile I'm suffering all the time
A mans tired its fucking up mans vibe
A mans tryin its fucking up mans life
And if that happens I'm touching man on sight
A man's bright, mans big out here cos mans giants
Mans sick out here cos man strives
Think I won't split a wig out here cos mans signed?
Think I won't get the stick out here send man flying?
Niggas don't take the piss out here cos mans kind
A mans proud don't fuck with a mans pride
Tell a PC don't fuck with a mans drive

Just let it breathe for a bit

[Verse: 2]
Listen, they say that I'm lucky to be around
I got niggas in the gutter that's suffering in there now
Toast bread only butter it when its brown
Like if a cokehead wants another im coming round
I'm covering mans ground
I say the word my niggas will dump now
They roll up and niggas will jump out
Cos I'm a real g and you niggas are cub scouts
As happy as man sounds
The street life was dragging a man down
So this rap shit im happy that man found
And if a mans slacking then man will get sacked now
And its much better than clapping a man down
When it's show time ama massacre mans town
And I make Jamaican and African man proud
Think you're sitting on the throne
And im cracking a mans crown (Straight)
The Peckham ambassadors back round
Walk round my house in a slippers and black gown
Niggas jump up then im sitting them back down
Thought about it for a second
Then a nigga just sat down
I'm coming to clamp down
Certified I'm laying the stamp down
Put your money where your mouth is
Lay all of your cash down
All who never paid homage are paying it back now
