[Verse 1: Ghetts]
What? Is that my man? Spin the whip
Right there jumping out a white van in the bits
Park up, ask Buck, give me the ting
One arm up, starstruck, ring-a-ling
Hard nut, guard up, I'm in the ring
[?] your car's stuck, this is it
Light work, my mind works militant
I'll burst mine first, finish him
Man wanna insult badman? (Bun him)
Don't make me involve Mad Max
I can make him do a backflip
And I can make him do handstands
(What does that remind you of?) Gynmastics
The way the new ting kicks is so Van Damme
Giggs ad-lib
After I wind down windows and bang
Yes darg, stay tuned
Cause I wouldn't have wanted nobody missing the best part
I came alone, Game of Thrones
No one's safe, not even man like Ned Stark
Raise the chrome, invade your dome
Look at that, I let my enemies know the benchmark
Rate the bloke and you ain't as cold
I pull it back and let my enemies know their head gone
Danger zone, it's a danger zone
Fully gassed but you know that's just how the ends are
Days approach with the same result
Goody bags from a hard day's work man a spend fast
These are end bars
Kill an MC, M-charge
Game over for them, red card
Who told you you could trespass?
Man gave me his CD
I can't hear cause my head's hard
My ego's too big for my [?]
And why would he give me his CD
When everyone knows my name's Ghetto, not Ben Scarr?
And how can you call them friends
When all they say is "yeah fam, you went hard"?

[Hook: Ghetts]
What? Who said dat?
Don't lie, swear down
Don't make me get mad
Don't make me get mad
What? Who said dat?
Don't lie, swear down
Don't make me get mad
Don't make me get mad

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Yeah, when I attack, fuck remorse
Pumpys come with MAC-10s and all sorts
All talk, this is my empire, the boardwalk
Kickback slippers and real white Dior shorts
Got man's chick on the phone, fuck the small talk
Watch man sit on the throne, pop some more corks
Movie, chilling at home, pop some more corn
Told me she live in the East but she's born North
Quick, quick, get the money nonstop
This life's enticing
This that shit that the strally gun pop
Slice and dicing
Click click, can I get a gunshot?
Knife or piping
This that cake with the cherry on top
And it tastes nice with icing
Fuck that, don't give a fuck 'bout opinions
Bap bap, don't give a fuck 'bout civilians
Wrapping the crack with the minions
Link man, then we can chat 'bout some millions
Man had to crack that Da Vinci code
[?] dominions
Soldiers up in your tent like Red Indians
Crackheads up in the crack house syringing
Spend it, hatatata, spend kit
Get that ganja, sprinkle it
Pour that cognac, drink it
Watch that nigga stunting, pinky
Watch that nigga's jumpy and kinky
This ain't Made in Chelsea with Binky
It's game over, Tinchy
Clocked that nigga dumping, stinky
Straight silk, that's the money man socks
Rider, Michael Knight ting
Tick tick, that's a money man watch
I like to buy things
Old school shit, goody goody gumdrops
I know this bitch wanna come and get cock
And I'm gon' slice it nicely

[Hook: Ghetts]
What? Who said dat?
Don't lie, swear down
Don't make me get mad
Don't make me get mad
What? Who said dat?
Don't lie, swear down
Don't make me get mad
Don't make me get mad
