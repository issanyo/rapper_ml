[Verse 1 : Giggs]

Another day in the streets to get important pounds
Undercovers lurking, yeah they're walking round
They was staking out my little nigga Tiny Boost
I know they're celebrating cause they caught him now
The prices in the drought gone up to extortion now
It's been a hot minute since them niggas brought it down
And shit's mad slow
Since morning I've only forked in forty pounds
I watch these little girls thinking they're important now
Only fifteen, children thinking 'bout abortions now
I heard that nigga over there just started snorting now
Since his nigga died he just couldn't take the torture down
Niggas start tryna hold their sons and daughters down
I know niggas robbing
And they damn near reached their forties now
This the reason why I can't let my supporters down
Peckham's on my back, sorta feeling like a tortoise now

[Chorus : Shereen Shabana]

Life
I know it ain't easy, I know it's real hard
I know your heart's got fight
For what you believe in
Many have fallen, [?]
I know it's easier said than done
Pick yourself up, you're still strong
Life, that's life

[Giggs : Verse 2]

From the police when niggas got them dead straps in
Bust them red lights tryna get a head smashed in
On the zed hype, tryna get them zeds cashed in
This is real life nigga fuck a dead rap chief
My nigga Carlton was rolling and the feds wrapped him
Shot the tyres out his whip, that was head scratching
All them niggas tryna do is get them fresh stacks in
Niggas violate, so we get the best mash [?]
Roll round like a tumble weed
Low key in the trap with a bunch of G's
Yardman's the connect bringing tonnes of weed
Niggas that make straps pop like a ganja seed
I remember running off from some dumb police
Cut the corner, got it out then I flung the piece
In the stash house niggas putting guns to sleep
You run with fat mouths but these niggas run from me

[Chorus : Shereen Shabana]

Life
I know it ain't easy, I know it's real hard
I know your heart's got fight
For what you believe in
Many have fallen, [?]
I know it's easier said than done
Pick yourself up, you're still strong
Life, that's life

[Outro : Shereen Shabana]

I know it's hard
This life we live
I know it's hard
But take the harder option and
Move up move up yeah
This life
This life
