[Verse 1: Gunna Dee]
Still linking peng chicks, I still links for them peng bricks
Cut out the middleman like an appendix
Still on my antics
Fuck a band, we are bandits, I don't care about a lot
But what I care about, I care about a lot
Bullshit is all I hear about a lot
They talk shit, I've gotta air 'em out a lot
Way before I was shotting, I just cared about that shot
If I say it, I've seen it, niggas say it but don't mean it
Been in the gutter, dirty money, tryna clean it
Broke days nearly broke me
I've been there and I've been it
Got the kicks from a white Z
Jackets, couple white Zs
Niggas looking crusty
I'm looking like white bread
Got them spots for a whitehead
Get any ideas and we light heads

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Man, it's all madness
Animal with some animals, this that animal massive
Standing there with that [?] in that animal passage
Niggas know me, just standing there posted, scanning out fassies
Man have just got that ready there just in case anyone gasses
Man are gonna get that burial, scattering anyone's ashes
Man always come with that gas shit, speed up, everyone's crashing
Itchy fingers, twitchy fingers, everyone's scratching
Man always coming with stories, add it up, nuttin' ain't matching
Man always talking 'bout patching up shit but nuttin' ain't patching
Man always talking 'bout cracking them eggs but nuttin' ain't hatching
Man always talking 'bout mashing up Ps but nuttin' ain't mashing
Man's some original gangsters, man don't follow that fashion
Man's always putting up pics but man don't swallow that caption
Man's gonna gully extract it, come with that gully extraction
Niggas don't care about no one, man are them banging assassins
