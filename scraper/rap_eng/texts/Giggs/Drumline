[Verse 1: Giggs]
Man's influential, man are too mental
Man don't need a number 2 pencil
Who's gentle? Jumped in Sue's rental
Man eat food, don't need a utensil
Man eat dudes cause food is essential
You don't move, I meet you in central
She wants me, my evening eventful
Grab that D and ease it in gentle
Eat everyting salad, eating his lentils
He didn't mean it, or if he meant to
He didn't even need to be mentioned
So washed up, he needs to be pensioned
Ital weed, don't even need Benson
Phoned up [?] for weed and he sent some
We don't need the evil intention
G don't even need to be questioned
Boom, let that cock and then blaow
You get that cognac out now and
Man is wrong for that, how sad
Please don't censor that out
Don't fuck with my man, this snitch
Made feds run up into that house
Man's bunning reefer, that loud
That gully geezer that's down
Man got Gs to pin down
Man got tings to ring loud
Brick you, tink-a-tink-pow
Next thing I heard, man got injured in town
You man ain't gangster, sit down
Man had walls to rip down
Niggas talking 'bout they're teachers
Man make principles drown

[Verse 2: Kyze]
Outrageous, bounced out the cages
Every day's work, I ain't been out for ages
I'm 'bout wages, stacking them pages
Same old swag, I don't care about the latest
Innocent, bust them two cases
Launched that yout, I saw his two faces
You wanna know about me? Well let's shed light
Been twelve rounds, still down for the next fight
Show you and your crew what it gets like
Run up in your room like boom when it's dead time
You was talking to who when you said Kyze?
Now you've got the Legion of Doom by your bedside
I want the backside, MAC by my lapside
Home safe, spud the G that I sat by
Fuck a dead line, that was back then rhymes
Don't try rush the hype, man tek time
Tell that yout not park in man's bit
Cause I'll have man outside of that whip
This is my boat and I run this ship
This high-rise is part of man's strip
Man talk shit, go hard with that lip
But you don't shoot, just pass a man stick
Nah, man don't blah blah and bitch
Man just grab the ra-ra and rip
Man might send a blast at his wig
Then tek man's gyal and father man's kid
No, you can't go halves on this stick
This got that karate man kick
Man see me and ask about Gigg
Hit YouTube, don't ask a man shit
I beg you, please don't ask what man did
Just cop that disc and download that hit
