Swagger's intact
Niggas ask why I'm so ragga in tracks
Ain't no point in grabbing them straps
I'm a man who'll go and get the battyman clapped

Mad pain but I bottled that
Hit some bottled yac, "shh, pop" goes the bottle cap
Thought I put it back, fuck that, tryna stop all that
I ain't gonna be no wasteman in a bottle trap

Niggas talking sideways, yeah I spot all that
But niggas talking my name, I'ma bottle that
Overseas they put 'caine in a bottle man
UK we put 'caine in a cut up bag

The game's going fucking mad
Niggas grow their own punk, fuck it up with sand
You're on Wooly Road stunting on couple man?
Then my nutty bro Knucks gets the drop on man

Is my swagger intact? "Uh huh"
And the line from the trap goes "brr brr"
Violating my stash that's murder
You niggas dumb motherfuckers like "uh duh"
