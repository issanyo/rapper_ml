[Intro: DJ Big Ryde]
Grind for a hot second yeah
Dunkno

[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
2am parked up like a stakeout
Bitch in the whip and we ain't tryna make out (UUMMM)
When I say we got food on us
I ain't talking 'bout motherfucking take out (Damn Fam)
Bags all weighed out
Line starts ringing I'm about to get paid now
8th of the grade few bags of punk too
Bitch carries all the skunk
Call her Miss Pep√© Le Pew (Jheeze)
Just passed D's setting up a road check
Text Hollow: "Don't go there, that's a code red"
Ain't gone through, battery must be dead
Phoned Foss to tell him "Joe said, don't go Old Kent" (UUMMM)
In a few stops, most of the cro went
Hit the traphouse, a little bit of cro left
No supplies up, so I couldn't fire up
Get rid of all the shit I got, then I go bed

[Bridge: DJ Big Ryde]
Alright Giggs
I know you got something to say
Get it off your chest G

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Mr. Ice Cream Man cause I grind with a big boat
Broke it down now I'm tryna find me a pink note
Ever since Hollow Meets Blade
Niggas running round looking for a gun that'll sink boats (UUMMM)
Riding 'round town with my big Colt
In the right side pocket of my big coat
And niggas saying "Hollow ain't greazy"
Take no notice it's gotta be a sick joke
Smoking a fat, zoobie while I'm stroking the strap
Pussyholes are gonna notice I'm back
Don't think I'm promoting the trap, I just zone out
Then I give you that emotional rap
My finger's itchy cause I'm an emotional man
So niggas better not be provoking my hand
Carlton and Knuckz niggas know they're my fam
And the black bandana that's promoting my gang (Narm)
Gangster like Mavado
Pecknarm banger niggas saying I'm the boss like Anthony Soprano
And don't think I'm coming here to rave
When you see me round the back, big strap inside Chicago's
Niggas in gangs, the realest motherfuckers that bang
Gully niggas wanna holla at man
And niggas think they're ready for the beef
Cause they gunned down on one little innocent man
Fuck them pricks I'll be chilling in 'Dam
With my big boy spliff I'm a villanous man
I'm sick of this damn, delivering grams
Tyna get the skrilla then scram
Rockz let the nine get em, 4-Fizzy's my weapon
Since I started rapping most niggas don't mind Peckham (UUMMM)
Me and Rockz coming home from a mad one
Listening to Big Ryde's late night grind session

[Outro: DJ Big Ryde, Giggs]
Alright Giggs, I'm glad you cleared up a few things yeah
So hear what I'm saying
Let's take them back to Saturday night yeah
Let's take them back to Chicagos
Let's show 'em what went down
Unit 10
Man a bad bludclart (Man a bad bludclart, man a bad bludclart, man a bad bludclart)
