[Tiny Boost]
If I ever take a L
I hit the streets and get it back
If I don't get it of the rap
Then it's back to selling packs
I just say the words and have my shooters on attack
I got a hungry little nigga, probably do you for rack
They be talking this and that
But theses niggas don't fool us
Slide in that dinger with my hitter, got the tool tucked
I heard these hoes wanna really show the cruel us
You looking thursty over there, we'll send a few cats
That how we do stuff, no fronting over here bitch
And once I take off you know I'm  going clear bitch
I don't wanna hear shit
That ain't about a pound note
Let a couple rounds go and knock a nigga out cold
I'm about road, nigga watch your life back
And I got big bad hollow with me right now
Pipe down or it's pipes out
Like I told man I'm poppin'
I don't like that niggas tone so my niggas shut
Ask my niggas 'bout it cos I know they ain't forgotten
We done made niggas move home cah we on
And he'll be doing ten toes if we spot him
And I ain't runnin' with it yet, I'm just joggin'
Light work, light work
Got a big kick on it, I might feel a slight jerk
Niggas had it for a bit, but I guess it's my turn
Lucky for them niggas, I was doing my bird

[Giggs]
(Ahh)
OG, back or maco
Cos I won the [?] nigga back on flacko
Manna bring the thriller shit, I'm back on jacko
Had it out broad day, back it rago
Back it rags, back it rago
It's just me and Maccy, nigga that collabo
Niggas got me paronoid and fucking narrow
Went and took the wheel off the fucking barrow
When the dogs reach
We ain't talking from the dogs speak
Watch 'em pricks jumpy, watch the frogs leep
They gon' get bit from the dogs teeth
Manna out there, we don't dodge beef
Notice one talk and a odd speak
Niggas never on job when the odds deep
Manna make the corn cobs lift them off seats
Skinny niggas, hella skinny
We ain't makin' mouse niggas and never mini
When we get to pepper in it, expect the chillies
Made them little Peckham niggas shell 'em silly
Little tummy, niggas ain't respecting Jimmy
Hollow on their billets, so expect the Billy
Ask the hell up, niggas like whats the dealy
I still keep them killer 'round me, get the killies
Niggas never bluff, niggas never bluffin'
Always on that talkin', niggas never nothing (Nerds)
I come from the jungle where it's next to nothing
Niggas wan't their chicken, niggas never stuffin'
I'm just in the background 'round the back I'm puffin'
I just got the buzzer and I said Sage buck him
Niggas get to blick and niggas get to buck him
Niggas want the money but it's never uping
