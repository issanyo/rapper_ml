[Verse 2: Giggs]
Active, do backflips, I got coke, it's wrapped in plastic
I do Patsy, Peter then Paul then Patrick
I got fire, a few matchsticks
Are you acting?
Got up out of bed and stretches
A nigga went and checked his textes
In the kitchen with the coke, Pyrexes
And I ain't even ate this breakfast
And they know when the 1-2 flex is
Long trenchcoat like Uncle Fester's
Man can make them dots connect cause
That go in that pot's infectious
Watch a nigga get [?]
Let me bill a quick Bob Marley
We ain't putting shrimps on barbies
Niggas getting bricks of Charlie
Tell me where you get that, dargy
Then when we go and get that army
I know that it could get that carty
You might as well slip that carty
And they don't wanna rip two parties
Brentwood side just by St Martin's
Man screwface like Bleach just farted
Man cook bass and flip that rartid
All shit drops, I'm in that carpet
Cleaned up quick then hid that garbage
Cocaine sales man, hit that market
Span that whip round quick then parked it
