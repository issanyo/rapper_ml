[Intro: Popcaan]
Unruly

[Verse 1: Giggs]
When we step on your ends, better run all that
Mad blap blap on the ten, man a bun all that
Man's back at it again, watch 'em run all back
Man not haffi pretend, better turn up that
I'm me that, fire that
Told them we buss it on man, likkle liar that
Man said he dance with the ting, told him buy it back
Shot in that fat pussyhole, man'll diet that
Where my weed at? I be back
Where my keys at? We don't need that
Him an idiot
If I'm hungry, we might eat that
If not, when the shotty release, it will deafen ya
Love the shotty, believe, call it Jessica
Man do not fuck with police, you're a messenger
Bitch, shot that crack on your knees cause that's the sket in ya

[Bridge: Popcaan]
Unruly, I'm me that
And mi scold hotter than mi burning teapot
We know say evil, I pree that
When mi mek boy run, mi angle [?] lays flat
When they see me uncork, freeze, stop
[?] squeeze that
Bun it anytime, no, nonstop
Then mek boy move, [?] that
And mi no give a fuck

[Verse 2: Popcaan]
Anything weh happen, happen
When the nikeys a step mi waan the money rattle
Mi seh mi fi rich until mi money rotten
Touching grand, and touch in a big apple

[Hook: Popcaan]
Attack dem like a alien
Mi a pree the pagans through mi clear Ray Ban
I hustle from the day mi born
And mi a hustle till the day mi gone
Attack dem like a alien
Mi a pree the pagans through mi clear Ray Ban
I hustle from the day mi born
And mi a hustle till the day mi gone

[Verse 3: Kano]
It's KA, vroom, I'm me that
6.3, that's about 5 Fiat
Some type of niggas in jail trying to get the D cap
Soon land, Hellshire Beach, frying snapper, sea bass, believe that
P stack, dem a pree that, rate those Brits
Did real songs with Kartel, no made up shit
Put Matthews Lane on MTV, I made those vids
And there weren't no path to follow, we laid those bricks
Hennessy bokkle and white rum, but nice from
When the building was a side long
But I watched Tiger stage shows from a child, don
Far as I'm concerned, my ragga stripes cyan't wipe off, mad
K-Kano in the house
Couple gangsters, couple ladies in the house
Couple babies, couple haters, couple pagans in the house
So how comes everybody loves me like I'm Raymond in the house?
Hustle for the mally, hustle for the pound
Yo, milli we fi link up
Instant line up, the gyal dem in the brinks truck
Wine up, man, they tick tock
Smile up for the Insta
Popcaan and KA
That's JA meets England, selloff

[Hook: Popcaan]
Attack dem like a alien
Mi a pree the pagans through mi clear Ray Ban
I hustle from the day mi born
And mi a hustle till the day mi gone
Attack dem like a alien
Mi a pree the pagans through mi clear Ray Ban
I hustle from the day mi born
And mi a hustle till the day mi gone
