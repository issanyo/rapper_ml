[Verse 1: Giggs]
Cuh man are strapped up
'Nam soldiers, man might act up to drama
Man'll clap them punanis
Over when man bap that banana
Got man at B right behind man's shoulder
When man blap blap the llama
Man get wrapped up inside his home

[Verse 2: Giggs]

Hectic, shot get fired off, direct hit
Exit, man turn lights off, electric
President like Obama, elected
Man's just top 3 selected
Man get top 3 rejected
Man don't want me to let this track
Eat those Frosties for breakfast
Man just popped Pete and left him
Strap links, man's just got these connections
Actually, I just clocked Rita's texting
Backseat, man just pop hoes, forget them
Flat feet but man's got bare selections
Air Force, yeah man's got bare collections
Rap game, yeah man took bare rejections
Now man's links is too hot to mention
Teacher, oi sit back, this detention

Cock back, them man clap that invention

[Verse 3: Kano]
Fuck you, pay me, my school's AZ translation (rudeboy)

Man won't stop till I'm caking (cook that)
Word to Kipling and bakers (white one)
Man might bust a Wray & Nephew (pour that)
Out for man that didn't make it (wasted)
When I got banned for drinking (driving)

[Hook: Giggs]

[Verse 4: Kano]
So tell dem pussyholes nuttin' cuh we done got with tings

Man of few words and that we don't mince
Tints at the back, not front, as if a man can
Take it back to way back a day shit (rah! basics)
Up in Leighton in basements (Mortal!)
Man might known me as Kano (Kombat!)

Then just mask up like Jason (Violence!)
East and 'Nam combinations (Highness!)
Masterclass compilation
But hear me now, hear me now

Tell them I wrote it on New Year's Eve
When I charge non-mandem a fare and a half

[Verse 5: Kyze]
Guess who's back in the jungle?
The ultimate warrior, who wants to rumble?
Dem little dickheads there ain't done fuck-all
When we ride out, empires crumble
Mandem are calling me soldier Soze
Ayy general, give me the word it's an OK
Nah, them 'Nam youts there, they don't play

[Verse 6: Kyze]

Big long strap like Nintendo
Them man know the real but pretend though
Man forever be king of the castle
Pass you, man might bring out the arsenal
Jail mode, man might bring in a parcel
Ayy gyal, go push that in your arsehole
And yeah, man's known for them ride-outs
Hide-outs, get light up when we find out
You man ain't got nothing to smile 'bout
Got no history? Bring your file out
Cause man's known for them wile-outs
Big straps give man something to cry about
Had mad cases Ds tried to lie about
Now they're like "which fucker let Kyze out?"
Madness, man fi keep up that badness
Took this game from man and caused sadness
Now they're like "fuck, thought we had this"
Told me "you're wack" so put man on that whack list
Chat shit, man got touched when I clapped it
Dem man hold the ting but I slapped it
Dem man lie in the booth but I fact it
Hollowman, KA, Soze and man wrapped it
