[Verse 1: Tiny Boost]
No man can speak to my squad
Fam I'll squeeze off a shot
Let you reasoning with God
Still Pecknarmed off, I ain't leaving the block
Got the black bandana plus the P on my top
The black hammer don't freeze on the job
Make a bitch nigga scream from the shop
Fling down my ting then breeze off the spot
Keep it on a low, don't speak to the cops
Niggas best fear when the gun rise
I don't wanna see tears in your dumb eyes
Have a nigga in the air when the slugs fly
You don't wanna be there if the gun sky
In a different league, done with the dumb knives
Fuck a dumb hype, load up on dumb lives
So don't make me have to roll up on dumb guys
'Cause I dump nice, leave your body slumped right

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)

Look to the left of me, the matic's in sight
Matic's in sight
Matic's in sight
Look to the left of me, the matic's in sight

[Verse 2: Young Spray]
The first move I went on ended up a bloodbath
I've been on murder scenes, I know you niggas heard of me
Shower crew rider, strap supplier
Dodged shots last week blood I'm a true survivor
Kill for the game, I never kill for the fame
It's nuttin to a G, he's walking dead what a shame
I swim in dangerous waters
Man would've got life if feds never caught us
Trust I would have pitched the ...
Ask Spenkid, I'm sick on the works
I'm a real G, and I will squeeze
Rappers wish they could be
Just like me, but no you're not like me
I'm in the spot with Giggs, Dubz and Boost
I've got my gun in the booth
Most niggas run from the truth
Here's some real rappers
Certified kidnappers
Young Spray, Hollowman
Feds wanna follow man

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Move even scattier now
Got yutes in the traphouse packaging brown
Trafficking south, slapping in rounds
Straps, niggas know I've got the fattest in town
Sitting down till the drugs come
Then have niggas running out there on drug runs
Stay out till the sun comes
I've got the cocaine mountains, you want some?
Let him lie bleeding
Greazy, that's the way that I'm feeling
Motherfuckers wanna better my squeezing
You didn't hear? Put the red and white leads in
I've got a move for the evening
Hot chick and she's down for the beating
So I ease in, then I'm leaving
Jump in the vehicle put the keys in

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)

Look to the left of me, the matic's in sight
Matic's in sight
