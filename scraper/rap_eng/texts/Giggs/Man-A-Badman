[Intro: Giggs]
Man-a-badman
Man-a-badman
Cah man-a badman
Man-a-badman
Man-a-badman
Man-a-badman

[Chorus: Giggs + *Joe Grind*] (x2)
Click click, bang bang
Ahh, *damn*
Click click, bang bang
Ahh

[Verse 1: Kyze]
Kyze I'm 'bout to break it down
I've come a long way from that basic sound
Niggas saying I'm hard now
'Cause I've mastered the art of the Pecknarm sound
And rappers ain't as nice as me
I've come a long way from when I MC
And niggas know Kyzer will ride
Grind holla at me, I'll be right outside
But I'm tryna keep a good head
Serve the buj heads and keep my boogs fresh
Smoke good cess and poke some good skets
Roll through smooth, cruise through roadchecks
And niggas tryna watch how I flex
I kick it like Van Damme, watch those necks
Niggas saying "Damn Fam", what flow's next?
I've gone 'til tomorrow but Hollowman's next

[Chorus: Giggs + *Joe Grind*] (x2)
Click click, bang bang
Ahh, *damn*
Click click, bang bang
Ahh

[Verse 2: Giggs]
When all else failed
Squashed the flake and make cocaine sell
Numbed your face and made more Joe swell
Fuck my place, I take whores hotel
They're sending me porno mail
Suspenders, corsets and bell
Hollowman 'cause they love this male
Fucked her face and said "whore don't tell"
But now it's time to disperse
Swtich my flow up like Kyzer did first
After this verse I drive and pitch work
Your riders don't burst, I rise the 5th first
Then light up this herb
Stretch my brain and write some sick verbs
Ate the game up like it was served
Stress my brain, I'll ride a big bird

[Chorus: Giggs + *Joe Grind*] (x2)
Click click, bang bang
Ahh, *damn*
Click click, bang bang
Ahh

[Verse 3: Joe Grind]
I'm just tryna bring the p's in
Find a new traphouse so I can put the ki's in
And I ain't talking 'bout jail
When I say I need to find a place to put the G's in
Rent me a place so I can get my sleep in
Rent me a hotel that I can fuck a freak in
Find me a house that's away from the traphouse
Where I can jam in the day to evening
No coke about so I'm hard of eating
Gotta deal one grade so I sunk my teeth in
35's for 35 and it's good grade so I keep my clients decent
They ain't [?] that are known for leaking
So I'm tryna stay away from the Pecknarm precinct
When the skunk comes back
I'll be shotting it up like it's open season

[Chorus: Giggs + *Joe Grind*] (x2)
Click click, bang bang
Ahh, *damn*
Click click, bang bang
Ahh

[Outro: Giggs] (x4)
Cah man-a badman
Man-a-badman
Man-a-badman
Man-a-badman
