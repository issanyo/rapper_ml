[Intro: Emeli Sandé]
High, high

[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
So high that the aeroplanes are envious
Yes, you know it's dangerous, this high
So high that the highs and lows are always highs and never lows
You know no lies
So high that the atmosphere is different here
It's pretty clear to see love's here
Oh, love, no fear, oh, love, oh, love

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
So high that the astronauts look up to us
Yeah, heaven touches us this high
So high we're above the sun
The pain is gone, the pain is gone, yeah, no, no cry
So high that the galaxies are at our feet
It's pretty clear to see love's here
Oh, love, no fear, oh, love, oh, love

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher

[Bridge 1: Giggs]
Man of us, man of party
They don't know Bugattis, they just cop a shorty
They don't have your back they crying [proper something?]
Weighing up the stacks, she got the pot of coffee
Finish off the track he wants the proper copy
I ain't even gas a man up proper cocky
I'm just in that zone, you keep on knockin', knockin'
When I'm in the zone, I need that proper lockin'
Got them words flowin' that's that proper [?]
Got me on my poetry with extra toppins
When I rip that flow-etry, gets them watchin'
When I say that line onstage it gets them goffin'
Yeah, fuck a gamble
Got the ganja and the candles
Fuck a bander for the damsel
On my beach flex in my sandals

[Bridge 2: Emeli Sandé]
I went to the centre, children [wearing guns?]
This is my first kingdom, fear is not allowed
(Yeah, fear is not allowed)
She said, "Take your jewelry out, my child, it weighs you down"
(It's weighing you, weighing you down)
Who you think you're saving stuck here on the ground?
(Nobody, nobody)
Watch how you gon' fly if you do trust me
My love, it can be your empty gravity
(I can be your empty gravity)
Find your freedom in my perfect harmony
Watch how you gon' fly when you believe in me

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher
Take me higher, take me higher
Take me high, high, higher

[Outro: Emeli Sandé]
On love, no fear, on love, on love
On love, no fear, on love, on love
On love, no fear, on love, on love
On love, no fear, on love, on love
