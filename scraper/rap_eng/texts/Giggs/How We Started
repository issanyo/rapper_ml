[Intro]
Niggas hating on our come-up
Joey, Hollow, Kyze, Gunna
This a banger, wait till summer
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up

[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
I moved one up, on the road getting those funds up
I remember shotting that ganja, when [?] was spitting that thunder
I had a Nokia, took that from a punter
He owed me paper, about a oner
I was chilling with the man dem, we never gave one fuck
I was still getting girls then, bussing my one nut
Who'd have thought of putting them guns up? Fucked around, we would get [?]
I remember [?] but nowadays dem man bump us

[Hook: Tiny Boost]
Look how we started
Nothing, look how we started
Look how we started
It's nothing to get shit started

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Hollowman take it back, slippery started
I'm talking about putting on classics, I might put on these Martens
[?] and then put in his garden
Nigga weren't eating right, just look who's starving
Remember that XR2, been pushing that [?]
Been wanting to see that show, now look at me charging
Remember that lazy [?], all that pushing and barging
Never got pissy at parties, couldn't have tooken advantage
Back to back, I went back to pot, then went back to crack again
Then man went broke and went back to coke and then rapped some raps again
Clapped a strap and then clapped a MAC and then clapped a MAC again
Then smashed the rap, out the fire and struck the match again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kyze]
Way back before I ever spat a verse, I had a buss hammer and a half a mersh
Back then I moved half-cursed, I had a rudeboy bop that was half-rehearsed
I was in and out them foster homes, this town, that town, I was on my own
Back then I was half a tramp, foster mum robbed me like "son, you skanked"
I bounced back like half a champ, got myself a little pro and the hardest shank
Jumped on a little garage ting, had a flow that could blow like kerosene
If I applied a little fire and sprayed that truth, I ain't never been a liar
Little devil started swimming in the fire, on a little level but back then it seemed higher
Speedy Brown in full effect, I ain't explained things fully yet
I was marching my food on the move, I weren't a goon or a bully yet
Skip a couple years or something's the story, had to buck it on the fucker like the nutter before me
Cause I know where my heart is, and I know where I started

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 4]
Compare these niggas to hoes, these scary niggas my bros
Hood nigga, used to keep every tag on all my clothes
Crazy mosh shirt, crazy mosh jeans
Hit the phone box to ring my hot beans
Olders had that greazy walk where their butt leans
Walked in a couple olders' steps till I got fiends
Showed respect to the niggas that I learnt from
But still robbed a couple niggas that I earnt from
From the days when niggas getting rushed
In the ends that they weren't from
Now the hood is a rat trap, make a pussy nigga get a cat nap
Young niggas saying brap brap, now them say niggas make the MAC clap
