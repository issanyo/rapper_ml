[Hook: Emeli Sande]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, listen
I bet I prove you wrong on that (yeah)
Give me one night
I bet that you'll be running back
You’ll be coming back
But
Don’t be coming gassed (why)
And
You don’t have to go home
You can come and crash
I’m a proper grown man
Bring a proper slow jam
Make your body slow down
When I come and splash (yes)
Hold up babe
I’m coming back
When its second round time
I just flung it back
This ain’t a quick ting
We’ll be running laps
But
I don’t want a weak chick
Better run it back
Yeah, I’m loving that
You been a bad girl
Ima punish that (jheez)
Now look who’s got their honey back
You said I’ll never be your woman
But I covered that
So now I think we need another track

[Hook: Emeli Sande]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 2: Emeli Sande]
Just tell me what you gotta say to me
I’ve been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we’re through
Now I know your heart
I know your mind
You don’t even know being a coward
So much for your high brow bossy ways
Just use me up and then you walk away

[Hook: Emeli Sande]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you
I could never be your woman
(guess what they say… guess guess what they… guess guess what they say is true)
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
(guess what they say… guess guess what they… guess guess what they say is true)
I could never be your woman
