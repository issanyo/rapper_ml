[Verse 1: Tiny Boost]
Got my black bandana so I'm Pecknarm’ed off (Off)
Lap gave me a message from the Pecknarm boss
Saying come lay something straight hard, not soft
Pecky niggas repping for the hardest block
Fuck about and get your top, half ripped off
When we ran up in your park, your little hearts got shocked
Keep shouting fuck 'Narm, 'til your arse gets shot
After the trap, holla at my nigga J
’Cause I know for a fact he got a jezzie we can lay
I don't give a fuck I'm getting paid
And any nigga fucks with my dough
Then that bitch is getting sprayed
'Cause round here my niggas don't pull stunts
We push grinds, load clips and pull guns
'Cause round your bitch, you little bitch niggas just talk nuff
But when you're in the 'Narm you little pricks keep your jewels tucked
’Cause we’re tooled-up

[Verse 2: Shocks]
Ratings, yeah I've got that
Virginity, niggas better know that I lost that
[?] we ain’t got that
Shot crack to a fucked [?] from my drugs dat (Jheez)
1.5, that's what the packs weigh (Yeah)
Die before your 21, that's what the stats say (Brap)
But if shots gets in my mac eh, explain to me governor - how he's fucking having a bad day?
Bitches don’t mix with dirt (PY, Dunkno)
I'm a drug dealer, said I'll tell you 'bout no flipping works
[?], got this shit on lock
So they locked up TB and flipping Shockz
'Round here, some hard residents
What the fuck you know about the Pecknarm veterans?
In a couple years time, guess what? They'll be calling me the Pecknarm president (Hahah, jheez)

[Verse 3: Y.Butch]
[?] on my street
You're welcome to crumble and you're welcome to leave (Leave)
And if I welcome you to repeat, and [?]
Well I guess you're welcome to cheat
[?] stick up to help us, repeat
And we've got real guns [?] talk long, so watch what you speak
So if you've got a [?] on, imma take that watch off the street
Knife work stressing with, shotguns clappering
Talk tough, I'll bust your [?] (Wooo)
Before you come just remember this
I've got a team full of [?] and about four terrorists (Brap)
[?] if you've got a problem with my clique
Shoot Instant, we shoot instant
And my intent if you're [?] watch your head burn line incense

[Outro: Giggs]
Jheez (Yeah)
Oi bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back (Hahaha)
