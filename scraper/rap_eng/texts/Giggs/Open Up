[Verse 1]
Walked in the party gone
And I notice Talkin' Da Hardest's on
I got my saucy Armanis on
Walked from the bar with Dom PÃ©rignon
Spend's got the Carty on
Let's get the party strong
I notice chicks want to dance with dons
Take a quick glance
All winin' on me for a quick dance
So I sipped on my shit fast
'Cos I notice this chick wants a quick glass
OGs in this bitch dog
Got a nice outfit 'cos I flip darts
Hands all over my zip parts
My hands all over her big arse
Strolled to my whip parked
No I ain't an animal but I rip bras
Jumped in my sick car
Pumping my shit hard
Took her home to my sick yard
This ain't old school days in the lift shaft
She knows I'm the shit dog
She knows that my shit's suave

[Hook]
Girl
I'll give your glory so love
Because your glory's so buff
Man I give that glory so touch
Your whole glory's open up
I'll give your glory so love
Because your glory's so buff
Man I give that glory so touch
Your whole glory's open up

[Verse 2]
Stepped in the party wrecked
If you notice these creps take Armani steps
Hands crept up Versace dress
Yes the punani's wet
Spend's got a pearly neck
And I notice his ring cost a 30 rep
So I quicked on the dirty Tec
Slip, get a early death
And my stamina is sick
Chicks on top all standing on this dick
Don't go lower ain't cannibalistic
Chicks behave all animalistic
So I'm savaging this bitch
All these hoes and I'm grabbing on this bitch
Porno mode all splashing her lipstick
All these hoes want to grab onto Giggsy

[Hook] [x2]
Girl
I'll give your glory so love
Because your glory's so buff
Man I give that glory so touch
Your whole glory's open up
I'll give your glory so love
Because your glory's so buff
Man I give that glory so touch
Your whole glory's open up
