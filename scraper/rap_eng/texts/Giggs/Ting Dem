[Chorus: Baby Cham]
We get the ting dem
Ting dem, ting dem
Mi squeeze seven half the pussy dem a (Rah, Rah!)

[Verse 1: Giggs]
My swagger's insane
If you see me rocking something nice
It's probably an Italian name
Stopped in the manor just to holla at Tame
Cops in a banger tryna follow man plain
Niggas wanna violate my family and claim, ratings
I'll cock-back the strally and aim
Banger since day
And I won't even mentioned certain man right now cah man-a-man's gay
Man-a-man play, I don't play about
Motherfucker disrespect me I will stab a man straight
Ran up in your house and man-a-man ate
Spen Kid, Knuckz, a couple other man came
I won't even talk about the story no more
Cause, I've already mentioned man-a-man's name
Spen that's a nigga that will grab a man's chain
Throw down your paper, strally and change
When I touch in the club, ain't no skanking in here
When I clutch on a snub, couple man disappear
It's a madness in here, a family affair (ahhh)
Even Mantis was there
Armed and I'm, so easy smoking a yardie blunt
So be easy, I'll disarm your gun
Never on a hype, I'm the calmest one
Chatting shit cos he sees Hollow and dem man
"I heard Dubz is going Ard Bodied with dem man"
Mans chatting shit about bodying ten man
I don't give a fuck I ain't bothered with them man
I'll let the 10 bang, Hollow the skeng man
Apollo with skengs man, squeeze seven and end man
Shotties and 10's fam
And I wanna shout yardman like Mousy, Nutty and dem man (UUMMM)

[Chorus: Baby Cham]
We get the ting dem
Ting dem, ting dem
Mi squeeze seven half the pussy dem a (Rah, Rah!)

[Verse 2: Dubz]
I've been around the block a couple of times
And I be around the Glock, a couple of 9's
If you see me in the dock them I'm probably lying
If you see me with a watch, then it's robbery shine
Look, certain man I know are sloppy with crime
Come put shots in your soul, body and mind
Look it's possibly time, that you knew that I'm Rocky with 9's
That you knew I was cocking your wife
She said I had a bigger cock and I'm fly
Cause I had a couple rocks in my time
Now she saw me in the coupe, but the drop wasn't mine
I was robbing on a zoot
I let it rain down start pouring on a yout
I'm appalling when I shoot
I buss that lead whether morning or it's noon, night
When the snub sneezes make sure you say "gesundheit"
This is true life
I tell a yout once, I don't do twice!

[Chorus: Baby Cham]
We get the ting dem
Ting dem, ting dem
Mi squeeze seven half the pussy dem a (Rah, Rah!)
