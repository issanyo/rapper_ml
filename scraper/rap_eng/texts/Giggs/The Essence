[Verse]
They were blocking bare
But now I'm rocking here on a rocking chair
Yeah, the block is here, yeah, the block is here
At the top of stairs, nigga, Rocky's here
Self-centred
Everybody tell me that I'm self-centred
But they ain't got a fucking clue
Another nigga gone, that's like the twelfth sentence
Changes
Shit's much different from the dangers
Shit looks different from the neighbours
Yeah, shit's much different, it was dangerous
That was man's bredrin, now we're strangers
We pop, bang, serve a nigga saviours
I watched man begging "nigga, save us"
And that man's never put in wages
I'm mentally fucked
I'm mentally scarred, I'm meant to be up
I'm meant to be high, I'm meant to be chuffed
Fam, I fought for my life, I'm mentally stuck
Man, I jump out my chair, you're mentioning Buck
They just lock niggas up, they sent for the cuffs
Had to call up my girl and sent for my stuff
Fam, the day I walked out, it went through my guts
So in charge
Everybody's watching, nigga, so it starts
Everybody's watching, thinking 'Oh, we're stars'
Everybody's showing cards
But that's that
Cause man's just pussy like a black cat
And man's just looking like a flash chap
DSquared jacket and a flash cap
I'm made for this
I came for that, I paid for this
I changed for this
I never left, I stayed for this
Fucking hell
I do this for my niggas that are stuck in jail
I do this for my niggas that got up and fell
I do this for my brothers, nigga, fuck a cell
Lord, thank you for your blessing, man
Every bloody morning, nigga gotta get that blessing, fam
Gotta bring that message, fam
Peanut butter sticky, get me out that messy jam
Them Giuseppe shoes won't delay that speshy bang
We was them Peckham dudes, jumping out like Peckham man
Old school
Smoking on that Method Man
Man was in the trap working all long, it was late
You was in a bar, out with a blonde and her mate
Bag of dots in the whip, it was on, it was bait
Man would quickly pass through, say I'm gone and I skate
I was sleeping before, now it's on, I'm awake
I ain't asking for nothing, I want it, I take
