[Intro]
Yeahh...
Yeahh...
Yeahh...

Look what the cat dragged in...
Look what the cat dragged in...
Look what the cat dragged in...
Look what the cat dragged...

[Verse 1]
Cream of the crop shit
I got chicks all scheming to hop Giggs
They feeling my hot shit
BB's wanna lean in my cockpit
Feelin my chopstick
Diabetes, feeding the chocolate (UMMM)
Beatin it off shit
Have a threesome, peas in a pod shit

I'm a bait artist
I done it bare back, I take chances
Straight nasty, I ain't glancin'
I'm a breast man, but I rate arses
Late parties, but I ain't dancing
Courvoisier fillin up eight glasses
VIP shit, eight passes
Suttin' freaky for me to take part in

[Hook]
Look at the swag, that's him
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his kicks and the hats matching
Look what the cat dragged in
This ain't your average bling
Look at him
This ain't an average thing
Look what the cat dragged...
Push up your black flag

[Verse 2]
Buck came round
Fess just rang, Nucks came down
My little slut playground
Always guilty but I'mma bust case now
I wanna touch base now
I want my cup cake round
Look round at Nucks' face smile
I make the sluts go wow!
Told the mandem to not argue
Nucks' toilet, Buck bathroom
Hollowmans nice, top class room
Fess stil ringin sayin he might pass through
My little light castle
'Cos Hollowman's packaging the right parcel
That Slim Shady, like Marshall
His Benz still coming with a nice car full

[Hook]
Look at the swag, that's him
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his kicks and the hats matching
Look what the cat dragged in
This ain't your average bling
Look at him
This ain't an average thing
Look what the cat dragged...
Push up your black flag
