[Hook]
Ride your punani
Drive all the mandem barmy
Said I just wanna ride your punani crazy
Ride your punani
Drive all the mandem barmy
Said I just wanna ride your punani crazy

[Verse 1: Kyze]
Time for the party, rise up my army
I don't ever play when it's time for punani
Black, brown, white, light skin and Somali
I don't watch face as long as they're nasty
90s tug I'm in a vintage Versace
Real rudeboy, I'm in an old school Karl Kani
I don't like gyal who act stush and too classy
Grab that gyal, no pussy can't pass me
Me and Hollowman we bring a bag of gyal round
Mister Loverman I make Shabba Ranks proud
When it's pussy play time, man's mashing that down
If your pum pum's good take your knickers off proud
Got pussy in the Narm, got pussy in Slough
Got pussy in the dance, got pussy in the crowd
SN1, that's a get pussy sound
Real ragamuffin, get pussy all round

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I bigged her up, she bibbed me back
Must of clocked, nuh Giggsy that
If you got your own hair or wigs attached
Man will mix and match, just @ my Insta at
If he's the man and he meets his match
Crack your egghead call that the eastermat
Oh shit, better text Monisha back
Sip brandy, Moesha that
I got pussy plans, I got sluts
I grab Skeezy then pick up Suss
I hit the M1 then pick up duss
Cause pussy has to get fucked
Tell that yout' that's my throne
Pussy has to get up
Grab gyal, bend up, juice then fly home
Cause at the top it's just us
