[Hook: Kyze]
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch

[Verse 1: Aye Garde]
They listen when I talk
Sentences are sick like it went shit in court (fuck the judge)
Man I've got shit to sort (hustle hard)
Mr. Sell That Shit You Snort (rare)
Kyzer, I've got sicker thoughts
I could kill them different, I'm the slicker sort
This boy's in the hood when I lift the torch
Tell your boy don't walk the way that Ricky walked
I like the four long and the shotty short (buss it)
Better leave your crippled, nigga, on the porch (budge him)
It's a must, I dodge a stalk
I'm just busting dust, that's what papa taught
Call me Papa Bear, a buccaneer
'Cause I'll buck it, yeah, I don't fucking care
Man, these big shells are proper rare
Make the sun say "It's getting hot in here"

[Hook: Kyze]
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Yeah, nigga got it patterned, this the sickest pattern
This that Floyd Mayweather Junior vs. Ricky Hatton
Fuck them boy there with the rumours, we'll just swing and bat 'em
We'll just ring the MAC at niggas, we'll just swing and nap 'em
We'll just fling the stack at niggas, fuck it, bring it, stack 'em
Fuck you talking swagger, nigga's bringing fashion
I've got gully fucking shooters and them niggas stacking
I just threw my bro a fifty, man, them niggas mashing
Peckham man swamp, Peckham man swamp
If a man step, Peckham man stomp
When man eat food, Peckham man chomp
Make a gyal sing Peckham man song
Man just drive by like a lorry
And I'm on fire like I'm Johnny
And I've got power like I'm Tommy
Man's just held high like a brolly
This that urgent reason, nigga, this that burning freezing
This that burger squeezing, nigga, this that murder season
This that percolating pussy after early teasing
Pricks impersonating Hollowman and hurting feelings

[Hook: Kyze]
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
I'm all she desires like I'm Johnny Storm
She knows what I'm fantastic for
Everyting lit, I'm the human torch

[Verse 3: Kyze]
All these spitters fraud, fuck the shit they talk
They lay their verses in the booth, I lay it in the morgue
'Cause once they hit record, you know it's a corpse
Help them with that five a day cuh I give them corn
Bodybag, I don't wanna brag, let these bitches talk
Bobby cats in the dodgy flats, tryna shift it all
Donny's mad 'cause the bunny slags on my dick and balls
Jolly glad cuh my hotty bad, make them hit the horn
I'm too much sauce, they call me Johnny Storm nuh
Gyal greet with arms out like a bodywarmer
Fire pon informer, love my day ones
That leave a human torched if they put the flame on
All you do is talk, you can't do the walk
You got Judas thoughts, you ain't true at all
Tryna scoop a pass, hit a few resorts
Your wife said I'm smooth, of course, she'll leave you divorced 'cause
I'm on fire like I'm Johnny Storm
