[Verse 1]
Let me tell you niggas 'bout the block pattern
The block smashing, the rock bagging
And I ain't talking 'bout violence
When I say that a nigga flang a box at him
I give a fuck a about trident
I see my enemy, I'mma .45 him
Not average Joe grinding
Get the chain out, niggas that's blinding, hustle on
But back to the rock slanging
My niggas bagging up food and the cops rang him
Gotta wait cause a nigga from the block rang him
They call me Barksdale cause my shit is block banging
I am getting jumped and I'm jumpy, cops hanging
Niggers hungry, a lunch be a rock packing
I remember when I used to want them crazy mosh patterns
I'm not bragging but my blocks cracking

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you man bout the trap house
Wrap up the crack round
Dash out and smash out
Back out for castle
Check out the crack house
Shot cats the same place
Your lap back and mash out
Junkies getting cash out
Hit west, get my cash out and splash out
My niggas roll up with a strap out
Bare black gang, what you know bout a black out?
My niggas back out and slap out
Submission hold makes you give up and tap out
I get violent and I lash out
Excuse me I bring the back round the trap now (sorry bout that)
From the Reeboks then got the Max out
From 10 boxes the Ralph boots and the smash out
And niggers rap to lay the whole map out
That's why I got the pen and contract out
