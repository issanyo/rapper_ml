If you got faith, then just pray
Window panes ain't gotta be stained
That's my name above the door
No plates, above the law

Rubbing shoulders with royalty

Niggas bite things that I do
And then repackage it, back as new
Sell it to you, I get overlooked
I'm not on the list, oh, what will I do?
I don't want a MOBO Award so stop
Nah, I've already got a doorstop

They ain't even put out a fucking a single yet and
Man have already flopped

But you can guess what she did
