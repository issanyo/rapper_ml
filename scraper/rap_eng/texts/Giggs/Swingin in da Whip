[Verse: Giggs]
Bunning my ganja
And I've got something shiny under my jumper
Man just woke up that lion out of my slumber
Better add a couple more zeros and we fronted that number
Hollowman ain't no goddamn hero, I'm just getting more crunker
Niggas getting softer than Bambi, yeah they getting more Thumper
Giving that flexy, big up that stunter
This is that OG, so I give them that hunger
Flexy, flexy, flexy, flexy, flexy, flexing
I got sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy bitches sexing
I just walked in, stepped out, dressed up, brushed off, quickly stepped in
Yeah that sexy chick Tanika, yes that's when she met him (jheeze)
Bunning that loud, one with that cloud
Niggas talk greazy, running that down
Come with that foul play, man's doneing that now
Man are all Giggs' children, they run with that style
Shout my bro Drake, them niggas run with that owl
You try run up that growl, wah, wah, run up and bloaw
I've got niggas that's ready and greazy, gully and vile
Niggas talk beef man, running that cow
Come with that wild, come with that wow
Talk about that ring ring trap shit, I'm the number that dials
I'm a brother that smiles, cover that ground
Nigga that's bait, cover that pound
Buh, slap when I say so
Back for the Pesos
Black for the A-holes
I won't even talk about fees, but it's mad for the stage show (yeah)
Sicker with the gift
Slicker with the wrist
Please don't get your knickers in a twist
Gorillas in the mist
Nigga you a snitch
Put bitch niggas in a ditch
Give them little bricks
Small, tiny, give them little bits
I've got niggas in the field, rider's bitch, nigga you a witch
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? Skinny little prick
Nigga banging "Whippin Excursion", swinging in the whip
