[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
You're still fucking around with gorillas
While I'm fucking around with godzillas
Got me, Giggs and Ghetts in here
I'm fucking around with the realest
You pussies ain't on nothing
Don't try act like you don't hear us
We bringing in that cheddar
While you thugs around me got serious
Rappers act like we've got a bomb on us
Cause they ain't anywhere near us
Our fans be like Zulu warriors
They ain't rolling round spillers
We step on stage and they cheer us
Mashing the place and go wild
Well, the haters be saying our name
But we ain't Destiny's Child
Hold on
Let me do the math for one second
We've got fans all over the world
And they started off in Peckham
We make sales in Japan
Do shows out in Bremen
But bitches be on our dicks
They be sucking on our lemons
Can somebody please tell them
They ain't fucking round with these greats
These niggas calling me cocky
Cause I'll piss on their parade
This pussy wants to chat shit
Till I catch him on his Js
And I'll lick his head with a stone
You couldn't use it for his grave

[Hook: Joe Grind]
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Get that Bunsen burning
Niggas got that Bunsen burner
Man's so drunk and ganja'd up
Man might jump at murder
Turn that jumper burgundy
When I dump that burger
Man'll touch that person up
Man'll fuck that curb up
You're a shitty nigga
Fuck that turd up
Claim you're gangster
You just fucked that word up
Break it down
Cut that bird up
Too much magic in that
You just fucked that bird up
Get that punky burning
Nigga, let that skunky burn up
Bitches up and turned up
Gargled, then she drunk my sperm up
Touch her button like I'm Scotty
Beaming Captain Kirk up
Little niggas ain't on shit
Need to step your dirt up
Man just came out of the blue
Better shut that Smurf up
Shit you listen to
When you cut that work up
Chicken nigga
Cut that jerk up
Twinkle star's being born
Man will fuck that burp up

[Hook: Joe Grind]
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas

You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
God MC, god damn, godzilla
Banana clip for a gorilla
I would fully go all-out and rip a limb from King Kong
Lightweight, you'll fly away when the wind's strong
Violate, then it's ding dong
Niggas saying I'm a dead man, well, I'm wide awake with no wings on
Fifth gear in the car, still speeding
Living life in the fast lane
I can't complain, you know
My heart's still beating
I'm so comfortable in front of my enemies
I can do a cartwheel freely
Eight grand worth of [?] in my mouth
I will smile at a hater
Then tear man up
Like a wild alligator
I don't fuck around
Aim for the shirt
Second button down
Now look who's underground
You went looking for beef
And that's what the fuck you found
You went looking for beef
And didn't wanna touch the cow
You got a problem with me, blud?
Bury the hatchet or get buried in acid
Cuh man have done dirt you wouldn't ever imagine
I am the triangle in Bermuda
I've made many men vanish
The way I handle my shooter
One shot'll make an elephant cabbage

[Hook: Joe Grind]
You're still fucking around with gorillas

My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
