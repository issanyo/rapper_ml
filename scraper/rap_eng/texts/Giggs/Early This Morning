[Verse 1: Giggs]
Listen, we're them able niggas when it's enabled
Man ah blaze up niggas till he's disabled
Raise up niggas and spin the tables
Then get the grade and bill it and fill the nasals
I've got the 'caine, my niggas, they've got the basil
Baby niggas, I'll push your cradles
I try restrain the devil and bring the angel
I got the stainless sitting up on the table
Bet they thought they knew me, niggas never know me
Nigga, it's just me and I'm forever lonely
Get your glass, this a ceremony
Better tell them little niggas that be telling on me
If we get to bucking, gon' remember donnies
If we hit up Clyde, he won't remember Bonnie
Got the toys, my niggas Santa but we're never jolly
We're them kamikaze niggas but we're never sorry

[Chorus: Gil Scott-Heron]
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I said: "hello Satan
I believe it's time to go"

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I'm a lonely nigga, nigga, a loner
Coldest nigga bringing pneumonia
Got the coldest lyrics up in the folder
And got the cognac mixing up with the cola
Vulgar niggas, my niggas vulgar
Roll up dro'd and killing 'em with the odour
Trample the lion, my niggas step on the cobra
I got the flow that's sicker, man, it's ebola
Bet they thought they, they never knew me
Heavy niggas, heavy duty
Step inside my world, niggas forever shooting
Tracky bally up, my niggas never suited
You can play it smart, my niggas play it stupid
They say I'm aggressive, they say I'm abusive
Cause they know I'll address it, they know I'm elusive
They know I'm the best and they know I'll produce it

[Chorus: Gil Scott-Heron]
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I said: "hello Satan
I believe it's time to go"
