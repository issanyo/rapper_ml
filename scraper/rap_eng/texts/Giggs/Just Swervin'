[Verse 1]
I'll tell you what
Yeah, it feels shit to be lonely
But I ain't gonna sit here like a bitch
Getting bitchy and moany
Old letter from Jimmy sitting here
Little script that he wrote me
That's arriving from my mum
Little treat that she showed me
Man's stressed from the streets
Yeah, this shit nearly broke me
'Nuff time I dodged bullets like
Man, that shit nearly wrote me
Think it was a Carlton or Nux
Or shit, was it OP?
Shit wasn't okey or dokey
But got the bitch nigga roasted
Mums crying for their sons
Man, shit's been emotional
Amount of niggas that I lost to the game
So I sips on the potion
Chilling on the block
And there's a pistol approaching
Then a nigga rolls up
And man slips cause he's open
Back then, I was low
Just literally coping
That's when the devil rose up
Triple six with his omen
I won't lie
Fam, I've slipped and I've known him
I got sick, man was rolling
I got gripped in the moment

[Hook]
Nasty niggas, ask them niggas
Masked up niggas is disturbing
Bastard niggas, won't put it past them niggas
Half them niggas is just murdering
It's kinda hard for niggas
Raise a glass for niggas that got birded
Look fast at niggas, they gave a pass to niggas
So when I pass them niggas, I'm just swerving
Nasty niggas
Masked up niggas is disturbing
Bastard niggas
Half them niggas is just murdering
It's kinda hard for niggas
Raise a glass for niggas that got birded
Look fast at niggas, they gave a pass to niggas
So when I pass them niggas, I'm just swerving

[Verse 2]
So we're sat at the meanest table
Right at where the meal is
I look back, think I saw this angel
I look back where the gleam is
This extension wasn't my intention
My intention's the cleanest
Man had to mention the realest intervention
So pay attention to genius
Roll with the greaziest
Fuck demons, cause I'm back with my Jesus
Yeah, I'm back with my Jesus
Album, cause rap really needs this
And is that really how man's sounding?
And is that what the deal is?
I had my baby mum stressed
I put my mum through a nightmare
But now she don't check the news
Because her son wasn't out there
No, her son wasn't out there, no
I'm in the house with some houseware
Big hand full of green
I've got that Oscar the Grouch here
Let God be my witness
Every day I read my psalms
And asking God for forgiveness
I'm looking round like "wow
God really did this"
I pushed the bullshit aside
And then I got with the business

[Hook]
Nasty niggas, ask them niggas
Masked up niggas is disturbing
Bastard niggas, won't put it past them niggas
Half them niggas is just murdering
It's kinda hard for niggas
Raise a glass for niggas that got birded
Look fast at niggas, they gave a pass to niggas
So when I pass them niggas, I'm just swerving
Nasty niggas
Masked up niggas is disturbing
Bastard niggas
Half them niggas is just murdering
It's kinda hard for niggas
Raise a glass for niggas that got birded
Look fast at niggas, they gave a pass to niggas
So when I pass them niggas, I'm just swerving
