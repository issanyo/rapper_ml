[Verse 1: Kyze]
Man was forever in the bando
Dirty trap house, getting that quick trap dough
Used to chill around the flats loads
It was me, Tax, Blacks and Rando (mandem)
I don't see 'em but that's my fam though
You already know how life can go
Got a long beard like Gandalf
Got a long stick like Gandalf
9 iron, my niggas can golf
Stop trying, you niggas can go
Ran them down, then they ran home
Next day, they woke up in the sandstone (bang!)
Can't wait till my niggas land home
Got a gyal ready to give her mad dome
They don't ever phone me, I've gotta tap phone
They know man is a mapper and a mad [?]

[Hook: Giggs]
Low in the ride, we're gonna buck 'em up (buck, buck)
You're gonna die, we're gonna fuck 'em up
Yeah, we be riding on them niggas
Yeah, we be wiling on them niggas
Look at the time, nigga, it's fucking up (buck, buck)
Nigga, you're lying, nigga, you're fucking up
Yeah, we be thriving on them niggas
Yeah, we be sliding on them niggas

[Verse 2: Fix Dot'M]
Came out of the can, didn't lose the fizz
Came out of the can, didn't lose the beard
We don't play around along here
So mind out, you could lose your wig
Rolling up a spliff, Roley on the wrist
Rolling in the whip, rolling with my chick
I was rolling on my seg-board, I nearly slipped
I really got shooters, I really live
Thugs make you do mad things, they move to you
Make you feel like not getting money's unusual
Make you feel right in the summer if you can get it popping
Or you stay cool and in the winter you get to robbing
Get to shotting, trapping on Christmas Day
Pulling up on them niggas that's got shit to say
Pulling up on them niggas, the pole to the chin
When I'm pulling up with my niggas, I know we gon' win

[Hook: Giggs]
Low in the ride, we're gonna buck 'em up (buck, buck)
You're gonna die, we're gonna fuck 'em up
Yeah, we be riding on them niggas
Yeah, we be wiling on them niggas
Look at the time, nigga, it's fucking up (buck, buck)
Nigga, you're lying, nigga, you're fucking up
Yeah, we be thriving on them niggas
Yeah, we be sliding on them niggas

[Verse 3: Gunna Dee]
Out here from the YPB days
Taking chunks out of niggas, I was out there with them PKs (Pepper Kids)
To them crazy PYG days
Watching how the whole hood replays
Tryna get that money three ways
Call it Freebase but it ain't free, call it three days (pay up)
I'll give you a tip, don't get a knee blazed (pay up)
Then round here, niggas slip, it ain't a knee graze
I roll with some greazy negroes
Couple cool niggas, couple debows (madman)
They can't post up with my G's pose (nah)
VIP full of juice, we just need hoes
Those three there, yeah, I need those
Or I'll throw bitches out, like three throws
He throws up, give him three holes
See girls screaming like seagulls

[Hook: Giggs]
Low in the ride, we're gonna buck 'em up (buck, buck)
You're gonna die, we're gonna fuck 'em up
Yeah, we be riding on them niggas
Yeah, we be wiling on them niggas
Look at the time, nigga, it's fucking up (buck, buck)
Nigga, you're lying, nigga, you're fucking up
Yeah, we be thriving on them niggas
Yeah, we be sliding on them niggas
