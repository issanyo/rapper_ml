Get back, I'ma let my gat go
Got an itchy finger, I'ma leave a fat hole
Violated, I'ma get you back though
I'ma lick shots when I let my flipping Mac blow
'08 and I'm getting back dough
With my fitted hat covering my picky afro
Feds on my case so I'm sitting back low
And my line's hot, so you know I'm switching that phone

Don't drive in the best drop
And you know I don't like when I get stopped
Real niggas ride to my Best of Giggs
When they let slugs glide in your head top
Shot white so I get gwop
Spent about 1-5 in the restaurant
Don't grind on a dead block
Got clients that buy like a z-stock
Spent 5 in the crep shop
Crocodiles all 'round on my fresh 'coste
Who's sounding the best off?
Unit's got it all down on the desktop
Don't mind what the Tec costs
Flu covers up the mouth when the Tec coughs
Flicking through a load of dirty magazines
But nothing like paedophiles in a sex shop

Black hat and a Hackett white tee
And the jeans match so you know the jacket might be
Etienne Ozeki recognise the OE
EO on my top, I'm a double-OG
Rolling with Rockz, Gunna Dee and OP
We're from down south but we ain't rocking gold teeth
Rolling 'round listening to Wooly's OT
With my woolly hood, so you motherfuckers won't see

Get gwop's what my brother told me
And surviving's something that my mother showed me
So I'm riding, and you motherfuckers gon' see
I'll be smiling, what you motherfuckers want beef?
Better back off me, I'm a little off-key
But I'm on point when you see me stepping on street
Ghetto v Peckham, I ain't on that dead beef
So I holla at my motherfucking nigga Smiley
