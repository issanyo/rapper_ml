[Intro]

[Verse 1: Gunna Dee]
Strapped up with a big strap
Before rap music, looking like I did rap
I make tap music, I can make a bitch tap
Pigs tap phones, one big trap
Rapping but I still live the gutter life
Cut a nigga for that butter, that's a butter knife
These bitches act crazy
Pussies everywhere, like they're Crazy Cat Lady
Didn't know about vision, I would visualise
Thought about prison, they weren't living nice
But I thought about living nice
So anything about money, I weren't thinking twice
Everything 'bout money in their conversations
Except for money, everything's in moderation
On the strip like I had the slags stripping
Flip, I put the money that I had flipping
Swag dripping of course, dripping with sauce
On the pills, driving through the hood, whipping a horse
I do it, did it by force
Gotta do shit yourself, they can't give you your balls
If it's us in the place, better give an applause
Forever buss in her face and make her get an abortion
Touch base, then I touch bass
Then I give 'em the course
Think the street's cracked
The streets need me, I need the streets back
Drop bangers, then I take a seat
Take a back seat, then I just take my seat back
Pussy niggas got a death wish
Got killers floating round like dead fish

[Hook: Gunna Dee]
I keep 'em coming (bangers)
I keep 'em coming
I keep them coming
Keep them bangers coming (bangers)
We keep 'em coming
We keep 'em coming
We keep them coming
Keep them bangers coming

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Man like
Better watch your fingers, nigga, man bite
Ripping in them ringers and we bang bikes
This that silly nigga shit the gang's like
If we get this winning niggas man might
Probably get the ting and let them man's ride
Spin it, then we skin it, nigga, man's like
Spin a nigga, spin a nigga, man's hyped
Ever been that nigga on a man's mic?
Wanna come and get you on your man's life
Come and go and get 'em with your hands tied
And you can't even afford it and you bang time
Can't even afford that little gang crime
But you're a gully motherfucker and you bang 9s
But now you're kind of walking on them landmines
But God's on a man's side when a man's blind
Gang wars
Couple drug dealers, couple gang lords
Fuck it, let me talk about the album
I'm 'bout to get 'em ready for the landlord
I charge a little fucker Â£20,000
Cause they know that it's the shutters when a man tours
I'm feeling like a motherfucking mountain
And these bitches got me looking like a man whore
Man down
Tell them man watch this little nigga's man's mouth
And my hands round these little niggas, hands down
Man's south
Gotta hand it to Ricky, yeah, them man's down
Gotta hand it to Ghetto, yeah, them man's down
If a man takes the mickey, that's a man down
Man takes the mickey, that's a man down

[Hook: Gunna Dee]
I keep 'em coming (bangers)
I keep 'em coming
I keep them coming
Keep them bangers coming (bangers)
We keep 'em coming
We keep 'em coming
We keep them coming
Keep them bangers coming
