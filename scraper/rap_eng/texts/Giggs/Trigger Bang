[Verse 1: Giggs]
Grab a few grams and a few grand
Wrapped in elastic in the blue bands
You reach for handouts with your two hands
Who's that? We’re the cool gang
No hippy but it’s so sticky
I’m a old school nigga, fam, I know Zippy
Steamboat Willie like the old Mickey
Steamboat Willie, she gets the whole dicky
'06 ratchet, had the old flicky
'017, now I got the ho's strippin;
Lowkey bredda on the low, sippin’
You can be the cool gang, but nigga, no slippin’

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen]
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands

[Verse 2: Lily Allen]
When I was young I was blameless
Playing with rude boys and trainers
I had a foot in the rave 'cause I was attracted to danger
I never got home for Neighbours, hey
When I grew up, nothing changed much
Anything went, I was famous
I would wake up next to strangers
Everyone knows what cocaine does
Numbing the pain when the shame comes, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen]
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands

[Verse 3: Lily Allen]
Back in the day like at Yo-Yo
Then in L.A. at the Chateau
Someone would say, "Did you bang, no?"
I shake my head, I say, "No-no"
Maybe we did, I don’t think so, hey
I need to move on and grow some
Been in the Firehouse for too long
LDN's burning, so tan one
I’m gonna love you and leave some
I’m gonna go out while I’m still strong, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen]
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
That’s why I can’t hang out with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
