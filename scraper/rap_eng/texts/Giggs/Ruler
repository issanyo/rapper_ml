[Verse 1]
Trap for that
And man got the cash for that
Man's with them OG riders
Man got the mash for that
Man got the high grade, grab that
Round there from the rastaman
He's like "yo, anna my yout, have that"
And right there, had to bust a man
Man's really been there, done that
Man's got the cap for that
Buck, that's my OG rider
And man's got his back for that
Man quickly called up Saj quick
He said "man's got the pack for that"
Beep-beep, got the M16 texts
And man's got the crack for that
Yeah, man brought the pasta back
Man dropped the big bad album
And man got congrats for that
Man got you gassed for that
Man was all gassed up talking
And man got relaxed for that
Man's got the mash and that
Humble, man's got the mash and that
Man get the big checks, numbers
Man's gotta do maths and that
Man's got the gaffe and that
Long gone, man's got a gap and that
Giggs, big boss, flexing
Man better caption that

[Chorus]
Super
Yeah, man's on a super swoop
Man's so shit
But man's got the pooper scoop
King Koopa
Man send the Koopa Troops
Send an Uber
Man's got a move to scoot
Hoover
Oop-dooby-dooby-doo
I got smoother
I got too many moves to move
Ruler
But I'm sweet with the juicy fruit
I get mula
I've got scoops upon scoops on scoops

[Verse 2]
6oz o'clock
Yeah, man had to open shop
Man was a trapstar badman
Man had the poker dots
Man was a rasclart madman
Out there with the boka shots
Link Steve at the Anchor pub
And link Mike at the sofa shop
Man had to kick the door
Man wasn't supposed to knock
Man are them real 'Nam riders
Man wasn't supposed to mock
And man coming through, street sweeping
Man wasn't supposed to mop
So man can just tweet, keep tweeting
Till man get a culture shock
Man got a culture shock
Yeah, man got an open top
Man hit up new friends, drivers
Man got his chauffeur popped
Man better scope the clock
Eating, man better scope the gwop
Man want your food, cereal, everyting
Man want your Coco Pops
Yeah, man's got the map for that
Man dissed them OG riders
Then man's coming back for man
Steamrolling
Yeah, man's been a tractor gang
I get bands and it's back to plans
What? Man couldn't chat to man

[Chorus]
Super
Yeah, man's on a super swoop
Man's so shit
But man's got the pooper scoop
King Koopa
Man send the Koopa Troops
Send an Uber
Man's got a move to scoot
Hoover
Oop-dooby-dooby-doo
I got smoother
I got too many moves to move
Ruler
But I'm sweet with the juicy fruit
I get mula
I've got scoops upon scoops on scoops
