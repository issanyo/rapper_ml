[Verse 1]
The sun will come out and it be summertime
Niggas got the summer strap out like this my summer nine
Some niggas tryna get the fuck out, some niggas stuck in time
Me personally, myself, I think it's suppertime
Think, when you're talking 'bout hits, made 'em a couple times
Broke, then I came back again, I paid a couple fines
That was back when I came out the pen, I had a couple tries
Then nigga murdered the rap and made a couple grime
Dananana
Old school, spanner banner
Niggas can't be stepping round the manor, manor
Make a nigga run up on you, bang the banger
Now they're seeing Hollowman upon the banner
And man can't even get over to Alabama
The border caught me slippin' in the maddest manner
I just holla'd B.o.B the man and brang the camera

[Hook]
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
Caught that nigga slippin', danadanadana
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
Caught that nigga slippin', danadanadana
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera

[Verse 2]
Shooters can't be slippin', shooters can't be slippin'
Niggas stand their ground, a nigga can't be trippin'
If a nigga trap, a nigga can't be kippin'
Everything the same, my niggas can't be different
I'm up in the party with them party bitches
I'm up in the party, made the party vicious
Hotties all around me, yeah, the party 'licious
And when we're departing, yeah, the party miss us
Mad, madder, madder
I'm not really beef, I'm more a leg of lamb-er
I don't like to pitch, I'd rather pick a batter
Cause man just can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera

[Hook]
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
Caught that nigga slippin', danadanadana
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
Caught that nigga slippin', danadanadana
My shooters can't be slippin' on no Candid Camera
