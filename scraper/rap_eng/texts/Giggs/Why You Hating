Giggs:

Yeah, we real hood niggas
We ain't living perfect
Everybody wants doe
Everybody wants whips
Everybody wants that
Everybody wants this
So we're risking our necks
Do and die in this shit
And I'm thinking to myself
Is it really worth it?
Got them O.T scumbags all on my dick
And they looking at me
Cos they know my name GIGGS (yeah)
And they know I could be mans ......

All I do is eat, sleep, sell and buy bricks
Hands on a white girl and .........
Big turn on like the woman i'm with
She's a little hot girl


Not finished


Hook x2:

I'm in the ghetto, tryna hustle my way out here
I'm in the system, tryna tug my way out
Making that money, gotta get that .......
Why You Hating on me?
