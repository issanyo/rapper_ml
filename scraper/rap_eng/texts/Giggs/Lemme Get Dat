[Verse 1: Giggs]
When you look at the facts
Then you look at the straps
Bus two and watch another little pussy collapse
We ain’t looking to squash
We’re just looking to slap
Took Jill so who gon get some pussy for Jacks
Nigga fuck all them dates
We be pushing them back
Younger’s grabbing man’s chain and man be begging it back
You ain’t taking man’s chain for me to beg for it back
DVS ones cause I got them bezzies on smash
When I roll up on prigs where the proper strap (yeah)
Know that Hollowman Giggs and Waka Flocka’s back
Watch where you’re rocking that chain and where you’re flossing at
Man’s blessed, I be fucking with saints, where’s your apostles at?
Bunch of bad bitches up in the club so where them bottles at? (yeah)
In the whip getting rooster from bitches so where them cuckolds at?
Man's thugs, if the shit isn’t yak, then send the bottle back
You ain’t thugs, and you’re coming round blinging, them man be popping at

[Hook: Waka Flocka]
Your chain, let me get that
Your ring, let me get that
Your watch, let me get that
Your packs, let me get that
He a fuckboy, a pussy
He don't wanna get that
Hit his dome off the hinges
All you want is click-clack

[Bridge: Giggs]
Lemme get dat, lemme get dat
Let the suttin' click clack, hear the kick back
Tell them little pussy niggas better sit back
Ain't no easy ride, nigga, this is Six Flags

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
Can't do no maths, kick your dome with that work
I can't do no talking, little homie with that work
With that 40 go berzerk, chopper bullets really hurt
Man, my youngers, they go crazy, they don't got no fucking work
No 9 to 5, shawty, we just get it off the turf
Them bullets is birth, got a [?] curse
I grew up with jack boys, robbers and cutthroats
Realest rapper from the States, shawty, even Giggs know
Got shooters that got shooters, we tote Glocks, we tote Rugers
He ain't trapping, he just rapping, if that's diamonds youngers snatching
On that ice, nigga, you a four, nigga
He's a bitch nigga, had to get it out you, nigga, Brick Squad
