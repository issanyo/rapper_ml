[Chorus: Angel]
Baby, all I do is fly, on some shit
I don't even need a ride, I got whips
Tell your man to step inside or hop in
Yeah, take you on a ride, say you wanna vibe
Girl, you working, I can fly on some shit
Girl, you know you can't deny, I got it
Tell your man to step inside, girl, you know I ride
I be acting suicide on some shit

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, come stay with a mad man
Come stay with a nutter (with a nutter)
Babe, man's just like that
I'm straight from the gutter (trust)
Beat the pussy up one time, I'm game for another
I came for the butter (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Butter for the bread (bread)
I wanna hit it from the back (back)
So get your butt up off the bed (yeah)
I gotta get up on the yap
I hit my brudda for the meds (yeah)
And when I hit her with the stance
She knows somethin' I got dead (uh)
Man's just workin' and that's just worth it (just worth it)
Pussy good, this man just works it (yeah)
Man just doctor, man just nurse it (nurse it)
Pussy good, man just worships (jheeze)
Man's ratin' it highly (highly)
Came with that stylo G
Man came with a stylie (nah)
Man popped up in that DM
And gave it a smiley (jheeze)
Then gave it to Haile

[Chorus: Angel]
Fly, on some shit
I don't even need a ride, I got whips
Tell your man to step inside or hop in
Yeah, take you on a ride, say you wanna vibe
Girl, you working, I can fly on some shit
Girl, you know you can't deny, I got it
Tell your man to step inside, girl, you know I ride
I be acting suicide on some shit
Yeah, yeah, all of my hoes now

[Verse 2: Angel]
I'm just flexin', I'm flexin', just glad that you know now
Yeah, you know now
When I'm all up on you, girl, you tell me to slow down, slow down
You come alive when I tell you to go down, go down
Yeah, WSTRN night and I'm textin'
Got the night ting buried in the west end
She just wanna go to the hotel
I just wanna chat to the bedren
All fresh white when I stepped out
Stepped out late 'cause I slept in
Paparazzi tryna get a photo
I know they wanna know what's happenin'

[Chorus: Angel]
Baby, all I do is fly, on some shit
I don't even need a ride, I got whips
Tell your man to step inside or hop in
Yeah, take you on a ride, say you wanna vibe
Girl, you working, I can fly on some shit
Girl, you know you can't deny, I got it
Tell your man to step inside, girl, you know I ride
I be acting suicide on some shit

[Verse 3: Haile WSTRN]
She so certified (check, check, check)
I hit the racks and Louis bag (okay)
And I just got off the plane (plane)
I was grindin' in the rain (rain)
She just hopped outta the Range (she wanna)
So I drop top lemonade (mmm)
With a lil bit of ice (ice)
Watch the race
Oh, that shit not nice
Oh, that shit not nice
Yeah, I said it twice
Heard they want a verse
They go, "What's the price?"
I'm flexin', she lookin' fleeky
Called her up in my mahiki
She all blondie like Dede
Took her to the hood and showed her my GG

[Chorus: Angel]
Baby, all I do is fly, on some shit
I don't even need a ride, I got whips
Tell your man to step inside or hop in
Yeah, take you on a ride, say you wanna vibe
Girl, you working, I can fly on some shit
Girl, you know you can't deny, I got it
Tell your man to step inside, girl, you know I ride
I be acting suicide on some shit
