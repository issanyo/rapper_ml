[Verse 1]
I remember as a yute, I used to get mad
Watchin' all them older niggas poppin' fresh tags
This is way before a nigga used to rep flags
Just my mum, little brothers, and my stepdad
Yeah, way before the flag was black
100 Pecham yutes gathering outside the crackerjack
Beano, Big Lee, Fighter and Scat
Ram, Inch, Trim, Tamer, Crimer and that
We were young, stupid, violent, and black
Robbin' every shop and everyone to try get a stack
Everything was good then besides getting wrap
Then Lee died and we all divided them packs
Couple years later, arrived at my batch
Me, Carlton in the house deciding attacks
Relying on straps, dividing the packs
Had mad shootouts, then Trident attacked

[Hook]
I'mma give it to 'em, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is motion picture, this is cinematic
I'mma let em ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
The way I put it down's similar to magic
Yeah, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is mad powerful, 11 'matics
I'mma let 'em 'ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
Yeah, I'mma give 'em magic

[Verse 2]
I used to rise the something for my brother
Truss me, I used to really stress my baby mother
Damn
Next thing I know, I got jumped by them undercovers
Fuck the flippin bail
Judge threw the hammer down, straight to Brixton jail
I'm the only Peckham boy in the flipping jail
But everybody showed me love, I was mixing well
2 years 8 months, what the judge said
I could have dropped dead
Nigga, fuck feds
Got back, laid down and smiled on my bunk bed
Touch road, got the punk Zs
My nigga Rich dropped me couple boxes, I was munchin'
My little brother Spen got the gun ting
Cause a little niggas out here thought they run things

[Hook]
I'mma give it to 'em, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is motion picture, this is cinematic
I'mma let em ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
The way I put it down's similar to magic
Yeah, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is mad powerful, 11 'matics
I'mma let 'em 'ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
Yeah, I'mma give 'em magic

[Verse 3]
Why should I give a fuck about a critic for?
I'm reminiscing about livin' in them prison doors
What the fuck'd you think I did this for?
Fast forward, now I'm witnessing a bidding war
Don't ask me how
Only thing that you should ask is who's laughing now?
All dem fools that thought that they was smart, who's smartest now?
Spen pulled up in the lambo and laughing loud
A lot of stush chicks starting to get nasty now
I bet the industry invite me to them parties now
Ooh
Cause I signed that record deal, they better chart me now
That's the money sound, bring the money round
Soon it be MTV, cribs, in Armani gowns
Floors lookin' marble now, park in the garden now
I'mma let 'em 'ave it, get this motherfucker started now

[Hook]
I'mma give it to 'em, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is motion picture, this is cinematic
I'mma let em ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
The way I put it down's similar to magic
Yeah, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
This is mad powerful, 11 'matics
I'mma let 'em 'ave it, I'mma let 'em 'ave it
Yeah, I'mma give 'em magic
