[Intro: Boom Productions + Giggs]
Yeah you know who it is
Boomblast, Welcome 2 Boomzville
Been waiting for this a long time
Spare
SN1's the camp, dun know
Spare fucking no-one
It's nothing

[Verse: Giggs, Joe Grind, Kyze, Fem Felon & Gunna Dee]
I told 'em one time, I ain't gon' tell them another
It's Giggs, Joe Grind, Kyze, Felon and Gunna
Nigga stop calling me brother
One strap just ran out, I'm 'bout to draw for another
And we ain't on dating birds, bang and get the paper first
More green, more cocaine, more paperwork
These niggas ain't on this ting
Nah they're to bait to burst
Let the .45 take the nerd
You can end up 6-feet deep or in a lake for work
I'm never late for work
I'ma make it work
And that man I call poppy, yeah he makes the work
I ain't taking no food without a taster first
In the kitchen, just me and Tenita
Money in the cupboards, half a box in the speaker
And I'm rushing like I'm bussin' a heater
'Bout to meet Tracey, Jackie and Peter
And I always seize the opportunity for more guns
Leave you laying on the floor like Jigsaw in Saw 1
Splattered that prick because he's ratting
Gave the law a ton
Stood next to some real niggas
Stuck out like a sore thumb
Man I'm an artist like Picasso
And most other rappers come moist like tobacco
They don't wanna see it rise like it came alive
Guys paralysed by the nine, tryna stay alive
So don't call me Joe call me 'control zone Grind'
Two O's in draws, that's how we roll
Got them spaced out clients, call me Mission Control
Parked up in the block late I've been staking out this evening
Waiting on some dickhead YG, zed's underachieving
I'm about to catch him in the block and leave him leaking
Smack him in his mouth before he even thinks of pleading
Rolling with a different strally
Turn you into chicken patty
Blow-out with a different cabbie
Leave you in a distant alley
Only let off half
'Cause I didn't wanna stress the strally
Stood kinda far back
Didn't wanna mess the bally

[Outro: Universe]
Yeah, this is Universe
Unit 10
You're now listening to Boomzville
