[Intro]
Yeah
Like a volcano

[Hook]
Guess who's back now (Yeah) (x4)

[Verse 1]
These niggas fuckin' up the game, im'a resuscitate it
Complicated game and it ain't complicated
This a confiscation order, man I confiscate it
Come to take it, rape it, break it, come to suffocate it
Fuck a side nigga, cause it's soccer tied
Fuck it my niggas, I'll be busting mine
'Bout to take it overboard, Kurt Russell time
Make 'em "ya", "yaw", "ooh", "ah" when I bust a rhyme
Getting records and, we be repping ours
Niggas say they repping shit, not these niggas' repertoire
Before you take a second step, man'll leave you breathless cuh
We don't care what set you rep, we will come and get you dark
Listen savages, better grab a turn
Getting covered in red, glass and chips, get you civilized
Got a Magaluf bitch, she's a bag of joy
Im'a hit that hole in one, Mr. Mcilroy

[Hook]

Get that second verse, give it to them, Peckham style
Niggas disrespect and hate, we ain't gonna be wrecking styles
Man I walked straight out them gates, when I beat that weapons trial
That was kinda stressing me, and I never slept a while
Niggas innocence, plead my innocence
Animals, with some elephants
What you looking for, got them elements
Man I take it old school, like it's Tennyson's
You think you putting in that work, well I ain't happy with it
You need to go nuts and get all maccy with it
You need to dress in black and go all Daffy with it
Rip them little faggots like a raffle ticket
It's the legacy, better recognise
It's the second chapter for the second time
When I'm stepping out, better step aside
Coming through the jungle where them leopards lie

[Hook]
