[Verse 1]
Big Ryde
Back on the street
That's why I've gotta mash up the beat
You niggas can't catch up with me
Don't make me have to back out my piece
Smash out your teeth
Run up in your traphouse and eat
Till we living lavishly off the profit
Bitch niggas out there are mad at the way we got it
Till money's all hanging outta my pocket
Etienne Ozeki, that's extravagant looking droppage
All you little fags are so fucked
Once I've got the mash in my hand I go nuts
I won't even have to phone Knucks
Pass me the ting, let me wrap the roads up
"Trust me fam that's the exclusive way you get me"

[Chorus]
Hollowman bucks
Load up the hollows and buck
Load up the hollows and buck
Load up the hollows and buck
Hollowman bucks
Pussyhole you're gonna get sucked

[Verse 2]
Chop up the beat
Let me show you how I pop up and eat
Fam I've gotta dodge up police
A nice pair of Nike, or Lacoste
No bloody Reebok on my feet
I bet you I'll open him when I pop
Uni only one in the vocalist on the drop
It's only the hottest shit that I rock
Yellow stitched jeans, and emotional looking top
Like I give a fuck to buck him
Run up on Hollow I'll touch a man's skin
I be on such a mad ting
Glass mix it up on a rasta man ting
"It's nothing rudeboy I do dis ting init"

[Chorus]
Hollowman bucks
Load up the hollows and buck
Load up the hollows and buck
Load up the hollows and buck
Hollowman bucks
Pussyhole you're gonna get sucked
