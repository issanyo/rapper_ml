[Intro: Joe Grind]
I been canned full [?] of hard bars [?], you get me?
Real grindy on the streets
[?]

[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
Grind (No)
You couldn't really tell this is a phone ting
Spare No-1 shit (Spare)
Yeah this is real hard (Hard)
Niggas bust guns (Bow)
Fuck them little lighters, I wanna see flames (Flames)
'Cause, this will make a nigga, wheel up and come again (Shit)
Grind is the name, blud I didn't have to say that (Nah)
Look, at my ring, and my jacket, and my Grind hat
Boxers with pockets, real niggas wouldn't mind that (Trust)
Put your tings in them, and the feds won't find that
Got caught slipping, if I do, then I'm peace (Peace)
'Cause the feds can't touch Giggs, they're trying shit on me (Me)
I'm just tryna make P's (P's)
I start a little buis, stack a bit, then the shit turns 300 degrees (Celsius)
I had a J-O-B (B)
My boss is pissed 'cause I was making money on the side, he's a D-I-C (Hey)
But that won't stop me (Nah)
I make my grind yeah, all my haters look look
Watch me make few cheese (Here)

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
This is dirty disgusting, breath holding breath taking
This is normal, it's nothing
Spare No-1 be [?] (Trust)
Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare, Spare, No, No, 1)
This is dirty disgusting, breath holding breath taking
This is normal, it's nothing
Spare No-1 be [?] (Trust)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare, Spare, No, No, 1)

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I once stacked an elastic band (Bands)
I'm up early with the cocaine scales and the plastic bags (Plastic)
Smash out coke (Coke), grab that dough (Dough)
That should be the definition of a smash and grab
The amount of times I've had to clap at fags (Fags)
But it's either that or I can wait 'til my back gets stabbed
Somebodies snitching, I ain't acting bad (Nah)
But the shit imma, when I catch that fag
Niggas don't want me fucking mad (Nah)
Because that's when I'll go oldschool
Rolling with my straps in cabs (Straps in cabs)
.23 straps and mags (Straps and mags)
And you can go to [?] and tell your family [?], pack them bags
They say they've never heard of trap this bag (Bag)
[?] gave me the beater, grabbed the pen, and I smashed that pad
My son don't even know it yet but when he's talking to me
He's looking at a smash hit dad

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
This is dirty disgusting, breath holding breath taking
This is normal, it's nothing
Spare No-1 be [?] (Trust)
Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare, Spare, No, No, 1)
This is dirty disgusting, breath holding breath taking
This is normal, it's nothing
Spare No-1 be [?] (Trust)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare)
This is Spare No (Spare, Spare, No, No, 1)
