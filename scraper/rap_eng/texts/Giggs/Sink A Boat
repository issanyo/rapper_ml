[Verse 1: Blade Brown]
A lot of rappers talking, they're lying
I'm with my nigga Giggs and I ain't talking bout Ryan
Fam it's stuck up in this rat race
'06 buss a strap case, '05 buss a food case
'04 buss a robbery with violence and weapons
Dargie I'm just waiting on my new case
True stories fam I'll show you the papers
I ain't in it for the fame, just show me the papers
Cause I've been moving peng since 3210s
You was playing with your friends, I was playing with the skengs
Fam we get the food then park it on the scales
Nigga this ain't shotting, this is marketing and sales
Like, on the block all day with them Oz's
Life ain't cosy the neighbours are nosy
The whole block knows me, they know that I'm OG
Went from a Q to a whole ki, Blade nigga

[Chorus: Fem Fel] (x2)
We got guns that'll sink a boat
And we got funds so don't think we won't
Food got the whole block fidgeting
Man I'm fed up of these bitch niggas mimicking

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I've gotta stay low from the feds
On a mad one, trying to get this bloody yayo in again
Mummy knows I ain't an angel
She knows there ain't a halo on my head
Niggas calling me the older boss
Knuckz that's my right hand, squeezing his revolver off
And he doesn't like man stunting on him
So you better know what's good
When he tells you "take your Rolley off"
In the trap getting rid of loads of dots
3:45am and I'm nearly dozing off
And I'm really sick of this shit, but I'm holding on
Imagine my living's on this chip that they phone me on
Let's get in deeper see
You might be in the game, but you ain't in it as deep as me
Got a bunch of nutcases loading up the heat for me
Trident on the case, and I know they want a piece of me

[Chorus: Fem Fel] (x2)
We got guns that'll sink a boat
And we got funds so don't think we won't
Food got the whole block fidgeting
Man I'm fed up of these bitch niggas mimicking

[Verse 3: Giggs]
The amount of times I've loaded up for war
I left all my emotions at the door
I ain't joking any more
Squeeze off, you'll see the bright light
Have you hoping it's the Lord
I'm a rassclart Pecky man
Empty the suttin in your rassclart Etiennes
It didn't have to end up like this, but you pestered man
I told these little dickheads this shit, will get messy fam

[Verse 3: Blade Brown]
You know it's Blade and the Hollowman
I can see through these pussies like holograms
If you want work holla fam
I've got that food you can sniff, smoke with or swallow fam
We make that block money, hard rock money
Never gonna stop, run from the cops money
Bathing Apes top money, ice watch money
Half these pussies probably never even had a box money
