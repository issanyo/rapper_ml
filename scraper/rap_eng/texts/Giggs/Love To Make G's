[Intro]
I am on the, I am on the grind
I am on the grind

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Fam I used to be so broke, I was stressed with a passion
Begging man for lifts, couldn't even rent me a wagon
If punk ain't working out
I'ma jump on the A class, what was you expecting to happen
Time to get the dust ting banging
My last few quid, copped myself a rusty to slang in
Me and Foss, in and out of pubs, handing out the dust samples
No sleep, plenty of bagging
Now we're eating niggas want to jump on the wagon
Would that bring me in shit? You never helped it to happen
Violate me fam I'll empty the cannon
Tell him don't tempt me, I'll bang him
When you was with a chick
Early morning I was out there trying, no sleep out there tired
The heater ain't working so it's freezing in the rassclart ride
Clock says half past 5, I'm outta here

[Chorus]
I wanna see my pounds add up to make G's
I wanna see my pounds add up to make G's
That's why I'm on the grind
That's why I'm on the grind

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Me and Foss bringing in the punters
After like 6 months we were getting rid of an abundance
Now the roads are getting hotter, the feds are on it more
So turn up the degrees a couple hundred
Fuck 'em though, I don't harbour feds
Niggas know I'm stubborn
My baby mother says I've got the hardest head
I used to meet crackheads
But now I'm on a big man ting linking lecturers and architects
Fam they say my sniff has got the hard effect
They thought that it was shit
Took a hit, then told me that it passed the test
You don't know how hard it gets
When your shit's so crem, they're due to fucking ask for something harder next
Ready for another day of palming bread
The phone's about to non-stop pop, so I've got my car charger set
No-one ain't putting money in my pocket
So I'm about to do my thing, who gives a fuck 'bout what the sergeant said

[Chorus]
I wanna see my pounds add up to make G's
I wanna see my pounds add up to make G's
That's why I'm on the grind
That's why I'm on the grind
