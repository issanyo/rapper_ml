[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 1: Giggs]
It's for them villains and goons, this for them riders out there
The original gangsters and all them minors out there
China white, bagged it up and then grind it out there
I'm tryna escape this shit cause my life's a nightmare
I'm tryna fight it, but you know what my life is like here
It's so nuts outside I can't show my son how to ride a bike here
Or take him outside, flyin' a kite here
Cause shit goes off in this bitch, it's dynamite here
No silent night here, niggas squeezin' from flyin' 'em out
They're flyin' 'em out, they're flyin' 'em out
Until it's empty, man's wilin' out here
Ridin' out here, try and survive here
That's a everyday Friday night here
Shit's tirin' out here

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Giggs]
This for them mothers and fathers that's tryna fight the fight here
For them niggas that's fogging and tryna find a light here
Man's climbin' out here
Fuck the back seat man's drivin' out here
Think man's smilin' out here
Man to man it get violent out here
Man ain't flier than me, I'm a pilot out here
Medium raw, that's how I'm dinin' out here
VVS1 I put the diamonds out there
Imported swag, that's how man's buyin' it out here
They say I'm promotin' violence out there
But I just got all the niggas vibsin' out here
Man's vibsin' out here
They say we the reason for puttin' Trident out there
Man's frightened out there
I'm fryin' 'em out here
I'm showin' em out here
Just throwin' em out there
