From them dodgy streets
Not everybody eats
They say Hollowman
That nigga bodies beats
If I tell em "jump"
Watch them wallies leap
Yeah, that thing that dumps
No, it wasn't cheap
Had the game on my back
Back was hurting
E went dead for me
Crack weren't working
Blap-blap that person
That MAC got working
Clap-clap that Kangol
Flat-cap version
They hated Giggs
It's rap that swerved them
Like-like "fuck that yout there
And scrap that version"
Shit ain't over
So-so crack that curtain
You just lack that certain
You're like the plastic version
Seizing his destiny
Go get them keys off the bed for me

Them geezers are dead to me
Man'll really put Ps in his head for me
Man'll really put sweets in the TEC for me
Man have really got street niggas next to me
All them villain OG niggas F with me
And your Little Bo Peep is a sket to me
I said that's not me, they wanna Skepta me
Bitch niggas can't get to me
Quick, write a cheque to me
These moist niggas wet to me
This bitch keep texting me
Told [?] to me
It's just sex to me
D-dirty dungeons
Thirty youngers
Copped that strap for
Thirteen hundred
Man's statistics
Are certi numbers
We're them 30 dumpers
Lost cause we turned his compass
