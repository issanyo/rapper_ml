[Verse: Giggs]
Living in a cracked-out environment
Where niggas moving packs in varieties
Whatever I ask papi for
He knows he's gotta match my requirements
Straps will be firing
Next thing you'll hear batches of sirens
Every little nigga wants to rush
Get their stash out and buy a ting
Been in some fucked up predicaments
Where some particulars had me up on some vigilance
These niggas went and fucked with originals
I draw for the strap and left them fucked up ridiculous
These niggas ain't seen what I have and
Nearly lost their life on the field 'cause their gat jammed
Clapped man, shit got hectic and I backed man
Fucked up life that I'm living as a black man
Everybody rates Giggs
I could focus on rap but everybody makes hits
Nowadays everbody takes sniff
I want my stack tight like the dad from Everybody Hates Chris
Even though I'm from the flipping ghetto
When I go shopping I'm a picky fellow
That's why the stitching in the AJ's are flipping yellow
Then I go home, kick back
Blow dro, sip 'yac
Zone out, script wrap
Make a phone call, then I strip yats
And I ain't talking bout
I'm talking 'bout some look-a-like Halle Berry's
Plus a cognac's already ready
Fling a porno on the screen of my heavy telly

[Outro: Giggs]
Christ
What kinda mixtape is this
I know bare niggas  out there chatting shit
Like they're on man's level on this rap ting
But obviously, man ain't making mixtapes like this
Where you don't have to skip shit, you get me
I listen to these othese mixtapes out there, bare skippage
1 to 7 to 16! Trust me fam
But this is pure quality
Hollowman, Blade, we do this ting
Mixtapes in 2 weeks it's nothing
Cut that Saj
