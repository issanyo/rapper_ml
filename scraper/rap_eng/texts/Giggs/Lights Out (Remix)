[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah
Giggs
Lucia
You gotta say it smooth
Ahh

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Get the heels, the suspenders or the tights out
We kept 'em on but it's mental like the lights out
Call me plumber 'cause that (ooh) gettin' piped out
You better do the right thing like you're in spike's house
[?] down pillows, it's a wipe out (yeah)
Hold it in, 'cause I love to (*cough*) the life out
Of that (ahh) when the wife's out
I said I won't after the first but this is twice now

[Pre-Chorus: Hannah Lucia]
Oh, no [?] away
Baby I need you now
I need you now

[Chorus: Hannah Lucia]
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out

[Verse 2: Hannah Lucia]
We're only just, only just, getting started
Wouldn't you like, wouldn't you like to get inside this?
Take off my dress, take a breath and admire it
It's hard to stop, hard to stop now, oh-ooh
I need the heat, need the heat, like inferno
Tell me again, do you want me? And I won't go
Love on your mind, on my mind
Yeah, I need it now
I'll bring you right, bring you right back

[Pre-Chorus: Hannah Lucia]
Oh, no [?] away
Baby I need you now
I need you now

[Chorus: Hannah Lucia]
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out

[Break]

[Chorus: Hannah Lucia]
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
When you love me with the lights out
