[Verse 1 : Giggs]
Need more clips to fill another gun
Said he loaded 3 more clips, go fill another one
Hold it, we won't slip, so bring another one
Control dis big old stick and bukka bukka buk
Potent big ol' spliff , so bill another one
Big boulders big ol' bricks
Here hold this, big ol' splits
They're just donuts, big ol' dicks
There goes Footsie there goes Giggs (I got em yellin out)
What Foots what,there's no piff? (I'll get the lemon out)
Control dat big ol' bitch
Come over, hold this big ol' zip
Got so much hoes that he don't fish
I swing that golf club he won't miss
I hold up guns won't see no fist
You won't see no tongues or see no kiss

We gon flip and buss a burger
Soldiers we gon rip , it's bloody murder
Hocus pocus, dis ain't no trick
Pricks best focus cause here go 6
I got the burner bulging, big ol' dick
It's gonna turn out holey, you know Swiss
That Liccle pum-pum swollen, you know bitch
I see dat plan unfolding , you know rich
I'm getting paid, oh Rico , you know Mitch
And when I cut those lights won't see no switch
They're cartoons like Lilo you know Stitch
I spit shit like (pft) won't see no pips
I roll low key, tinted DLOW whips
I might scratch that finger, you know itch
I said if it ain't broken then we won't fix
I might whip dat hair back Willow Smith

[Verse 2 : Footsie]
You're in deep shit and can't get out
Man have got heat and with the flames get out
Everybody here best start get out
A man got hit, got left dead out
Hit him in his lung and he's lumping that
The time of death, the coroner and that
'It was kind of early' said man, got whipped at 4:30
He thought he was roadman, now he's all cold, fam
Laying on the floor cause he's not worthy
Premature, man'll buss all early
Gun in hand, firing all sturdy
You man look kind of nerdy
But your girl looks good, come here Shirley
And take this dick, it's big and burly
Yeah, come on over
Them man there man will run all over
I can see a couple man-a move like a cobra
I'm a boss, boss, tell 'em a solider
Yeah, I'll get to work
You heard what I said, 'get to work'
Before the ting was on safety
Now it's set to murk
Extended clip'll extend the work
Look, you'll get smothered in dirt
Giggs and Footsie shoveling dirt
Nah, you don't want to end up in a hole
The roads are fucked, they'll take their toll
I am a situation you can't control
I'm well out out of order
I'll come with a gun that works
None of my guns are out of order
