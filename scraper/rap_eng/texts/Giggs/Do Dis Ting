[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah, Hollowman
Gunna, Felon
Welcome 2 Boomzville
Cash in the rassclart building
It's nothing

[Verse 1: Gunna Dee + Fem Fel]
Snitches in the station leaving letters like the mailman
Bitch niggas pointing fingers like they just got their nails done
I do early robberies to start my daytime
You can say I wake up, just to make you lay down
But don't act up, or I'll make you stay down
You wanna act up and hide?
You'll get wrapped up and tied
You're fucking with the Pecknarm killers
But you'll still get wrapped up alive
'Round here, there ain't no fakes you better get your facts right
'Cause Hollow's got the Mac
And you won't get that Mac with no fries
With that Mac, you'll get wrapped and left to the side
My Pecknizzy niggas, trust me we do this
You can tell we're the realest
We don't fuck with pretenders
Pecknarm, SN1, a bunch of top hitters
You don't wanna get your top popped like a Guinness

[Chorus: Giggs]
Do dis ting
Niggas better know we
Do dis ting
Jail niggas know we
Do dis ting
Southside niggas
Do dis ting
Pecknizzy niggas
Do dis ting
Even bitches know we
Do dis ting, do dis ting

[Verse 2: Fem Fel]
Potential pistol popper, slash Crystal popper
Got the shotty in my lap feeling like a trucker
Every nigga's staring at the lad
Since Hollow Gind, every nigga's staring at the bag
Arms out like I'm balanced on a stunt
More guns out, niggas act silly then you dun know
I left niggas marked like a rubber band
And I let it spark, one chance I'ma drop a man
They say they ain't heard of the Felon
I've been out here bringing half-a-bird in for seven
And I'm pissed off, bitch niggas get it criss-crossed
I creep on a rich nigga with my shit cocked
And I'm still good with the metaphor
Trey-pound seen more spins than a record store
Felon I'm a legend on this rap ting
One diss and it's definitely a strap ting

[Chorus: Giggs]
Do dis ting
Niggas better know we
Do dis ting
Jail niggas know we
Do dis ting
Southside niggas
Do dis ting
Pecknizzy niggas
Do dis ting
Even bitches know we
Do dis ting, do dis ting

[Verse 3: Giggs]
I'ma, show you prats what a banger is
I'ma show you niggas what immaculate swagger is
Look how expensive the jacket is
I ain't gotta mention my strategies
Back where the manor is
Strapping the cannabis
Blacked-out whip, with the strap in the back of it
Or it might be packed with a bag of chips
A-class, I ain't gotta mention my category
Vexed that I'm trapping
He shouldn't even think 'bout attacking me
Niggas better step from the back of me
If I pull the spesh out my jacket
Me and Gunna Dee might flip out and press shit erratically
Don't try make a mug of me, what's the matter b
My niggas stay sucker-free, ain't no jacking me
And we ain't fucking with the D's, ain't no ratting g
Pecknarm niggas are the greaziest packing heat
