[Verse 1: Dubz]
I'm just living my life, you can hate if you want
I'll be sitting outside with the oven mitts on
Cause the fire's in my palm and scuffing is long
So I'm firing the arm then I'm gone
If you said I'm flyer than Ferrari you're wrong
I'm flyer than your entire army, you can't see?
Well my attires Versace, you can't see?
Well the 9's fibreglass G you wan see?
Plus these chicks say my dick's like a palm tree
They're rocking it up, tyna make me drop em a nut
First the sis, then the mum, then the auntie
I'm mopping it up, that's what you call properly fucked
Yes you probably duck, when my possie pop up
If you cross me you're fucked, guaranteed popping him up
Standardly chopping him up
If you know about me then you know that my family has got it locked

[Chorus: Giggs + Dubz] (x2)
Pain is the essence, the game is a lesson
Violate us, a mistake you'll be making
Aiming the Wesson
Bloodstains on the weapon

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Thinking that only the Lord knows
How I used to struggle for tenner and score notes
Mum said hurry up put on your school clothes
Nothing weren't popping in Hollowman's wardrobe
Lap used to check me, lived on the second floor
Jookz over that side, Vest was a couple doors
We invested in couple draws (couple quid still)
Nothing less nigga nothing more
If I coulda seen the future I woulda saw
Me, would I step through another door (yeah)
Would I let mother suffer for, me?
Locked up in the gutter boy
Look now I'm stressed had a couple wars
I'm that nigga that'll press on a double-4
I'm depressed that your mother saw
Slugs sitting in your chest and your upper jaw

[Chorus: Giggs + Dubz] (x2)
Pain is the essence, the game is a lesson
Violate us, a mistake you'll be making
Aiming the Wesson
Bloodstains on the weapon

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Hollowman Dubz, Hollowman Dubplate
Real gun bussers and niggas that cut cake
You can act hard but I know I won't break
So dun with the hype ting nigga for fuck sake
Run with the white ting, nigga I touch flake
Argue with wifey cause I come in late (oohhh)
Stuck in a big maze, living this shit way

[Verse 3: Dubz]
I remember when I never had a spliff to puff
Me, Kieran, Walton and Christopher
Used to get on the train looking for pricks to suck
Now we get on the plane looking to piff these buds
Back then, a ton was a lot of change
One jeans, one jumper I couldn't change
Until I met the buj and 'caine
Now I'm tryna get the Range with the wooden grain

[Chorus: Giggs + Dubz] (x2)
Pain is the essence, the game is a lesson
Violate us, a mistake you'll be making
Aiming the Wesson
Bloodstains on the weapon
