[Verse 1: Giggs]
I'm learning that
Most niggas ain't shooters
I've never ever heard him clap
Giggs been about before you've heard him rap
You keep your gun up in the house
That's a virgin strap
I'm taking risks
And I'm on the naked strip
Motherfucking raping sniff
And I ain't on no wasteman shit
While these niggas hugging up their balls
Like a baseball mitt
Low baseball cap
I just copped a baseball bat
And I can make your face look flat
Tryna get that baseball cash
Amount of times I said baseball
You'd think this was a baseball match
This prat wouldn't want it
If I jumped out with the strap
Like R. Kelly did in 'Trapped In The Closet'
You niggas are actors and wallys
And ima keep banging 'till I'm captured by squally

[Chorus: Giggs + Slums]
G I've got the metal bruh
They say it's born alone, die alone
I've got my full strap when it's beef
I don't keep my 9 at home
And I don't like your dome
So calm yourself down, don't get excited holmes

[Verse 2: Tiny Grem]

[Chorus: Giggs + Slums]
G I've got the metal bruh
They say it's born alone, die alone
I've got my full strap when it's beef
I don't keep my 9 at home
And I don't like your dome
So calm yourself down, don't get excited holmes

[Verse 3: Colours]

[Chorus: Giggs + Slums]
G I've got the metal bruh
They say it's born alone, die alone
I've got my full strap when it's beef
I don't keep my 9 at home
And I don't like your dome
So calm yourself down, don't get excited holmes
