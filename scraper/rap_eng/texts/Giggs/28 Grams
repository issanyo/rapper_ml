[Gunna Dee] (Giggs)
You can call it a relationship
It's like I broke up with dough, the way I make it up
I just wanna see my paper lift
Hands clipped to my paper like a paperclip
Don't tell me to paint a pic
'Cause the pitches I give you just take a sniff
You want 28 grams?
I just make you pay for 26
(Ooo, Gunna Dee the young trapstar)
I've been over the green like a tractor (UUMMM!)
I can't see that far
But I see my dreams with the A class
And I'm able just to be grateful
'Cause there's no crime in my life that I've paid for
Dude I'm doing crime everyday
Out on the trap 'cause this crack pays me

[Dubz]
I don't own no woman, I just borrow chicks
I don't own no car, I just borrow whips
Call me George Bush Jr in this politics
'Cause I wage war sooner than them horror flicks
As for the chicks, my dick stays polished
And as for the whip, the tint stays on it
Pay homage, the whip game's on it
Started of with 28, 32 came from it
Your crew don't want it
My clip takes hollow tips
Big papa bear, now tell me where my porridge is
I might pop up, and turn you piglets into sausages
Put your foot in my shoes, now visit your chiropodist
And for you slow niggas, that's the feet doctor
So if you owe figures, better speak proper
'Cause I'll G-lock ya
And I don't mean the feds when I tell a nigga that I'll make him meet copper

[Giggs]
Hot step in them damn streets
Black bandana gang, Pecky man bang heat (UUMMM!)
What's better than mad beef?
Roll up, pepper them man's jeep
28 grams beat
Man speaks, and they will get peppered 10 man deep
Step on your man's G
Weapon in hands we
Squeeze off and tek off your man's cheek
I'm serving them rounds
I'm burning them down
Big .357 that's a murderous pound
I'm determined to prowl
Niggas wanna murk me
But I found out first and I turned it around
Cops swerving around, it's an on top
Docs lurking around, for the gunshot
Fuck lurking about, blowing non stop
The yout minding his mouth, got his lung popped
