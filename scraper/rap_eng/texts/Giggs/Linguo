[Chorus: Donae'o]
Shout out to my niggas on the wing, though
My niggas walk in with it like it's legal
Got two bitches kissing, bilingual
They don't even understand my lingo
Brr brr, that's the money ringtone
I love my money pink and all in singles
Baby, bring that pussy this way
But don't worry 'bout a ting, though

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Man's up and I'm up in the palace
'Gnac cup and I'm puffing the chalice
Huff and I puff on the baddest
Chick buffer and buffer the gyalist
I like 'nuff of them up in the garage
Fuck it, I'll cover the damage
Just bring couple of, couple of Karens
And bring couple of, couple of Sharons
Buss it or buss up your cannon
Buss up your, buss up your cannon
'Nuff of them up in the cabin
'Nuff of them up and they're grabbing
Man are just up in there crabbing
Nuttin' can stop 'em from gagging
I bob and weave, little ducking and jabbing
Shit's nuts, man, you couldn't imagine

[Chorus: Donae'o]
Shout out to my niggas on the wing, though
My niggas walk in with it like it's legal
Got two bitches kissing, bilingual
They don't even understand my lingo
Brr brr, that's the money ringtone
I love my money pink and all in singles
Baby, bring that pussy this way
But don't worry 'bout a ting, though

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Man's up on the top of the damage
Man's up on the top of the planet
I Mike Jackson on top of your Janet
Just jack it and chop it and bang it
Fat pussy, just hop on the rabbit
Just unzip it and drop it and grab it
It's on top when I lock it and stab it
I can't drop her, I got her to cab it
Cock up your, cock up your batty
Cock up your, cock up your batty
Big dog all on top of the catty
Fat cock, a great jock in the patty
Big strap, man ah pop it off scatty
Chat too much cuh dem pussyhole chatty
I'm old school when I come for the yatty
She ain't got a Scooby Doo when I ran in it scrappy

[Chorus: Donae'o]
Shout out to my niggas on the wing, though
My niggas walk in with it like it's legal
Got two bitches kissing, bilingual
They don't even understand my lingo
Brr brr, that's the money ringtone
I love my money pink and all in singles
Baby, bring that pussy this way
But don't worry 'bout a ting, though
