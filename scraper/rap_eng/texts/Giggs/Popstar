[Verse 1: AnGel]
Lights off, no games
It's about to get really crazy
Rude boy, gold chain
I'm a pretty damn fly thing I say
Na, I ain't tryna hear a thing
Couldn't pay me to be him
Let loose, boom bang
Take the silence off the thing
Ring ring it sings

[Bridge]
If you label me a gangster
I'll have my trousers down lower then I thank ya
Stereotype nice to meet ya
Put ya slogans on the wall
Can you scream it any louder?

[Hook: AnGel]
I'm a ----- I'm a ----
I'm just whatever you want
He's a snitch he's a fake
He ain't realer than my mate
He's a popstar
Damn right I'm a popstar
He ain't bad cause he sings
Couldn't do a thing
Destined to fail
Did you hear he wen'a jail?
He's a popstar
Damn right I'm a popstar

[Verse 2: AnGel]
Lights on, wake up
You can never sleep on what I got
He ain't sayin' nada, Louis V or Prada
I'm comin' with a whole new style
Mick Jagger
I ain't tryna hear a thing
Couldn't pay me to be him
Let loose, boom bang
Take the silence off the thing
Ring ring it sings

[Bridge]
If you label me a gangster
I'll have my trousers down lower then I thank ya
Stereotype nice to meet ya
Put ya slogans on the wall
Can you scream it any louder?

[Hook: AnGel]
I'm a ----- I'm a ----
I'm just whatever you want
He's a snitch he's a fake
He ain't realer than my mate
He's a popstar
Damn right I'm a popstar
He ain't bad cause he sings
Couldn't do a thing
Destined to fail
Did you hear he wen'a jail?
He's a popstar
Damn right I'm a popstar

Damn right I'm a popstar x 4

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Listen
I ain't tellin' a lie
When it's hollow man better turn ya stereos high
'ere with AnGel, you could either sell it or buy it
I'm a perfect example of a stereotype
Gangster, wep in my side
Any foe against me, you better step on my side
When the gat starts pepperin' I bet you all dive
Better make sure you get him I don't want him alive
Let's talk about the cheque I got when I signed
Told the record labels to keep the decimals high
I'm that six-figure nigga, I'm the best you can buy
Little bit of sens' on the side
Told the chick take her knickers off and set 'em aside
And then I'll decide
If she's gonna get some willy tonight

[Hook: AnGel]
I'm a ----- I'm a ----
I'm just whatever you want
He's a snitch he's a fake
He ain't realer than my mate
He's a popstar
Damn right I'm a popstar
He ain't bad cause he sings
Couldn't do a thing
Destined to fail
Did you hear he wen'a jail?
He's a popstar
Better believe that I'm a popstar

Damn right I'm a popstar x 8
