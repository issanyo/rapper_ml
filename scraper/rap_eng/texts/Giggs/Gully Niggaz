[Intro: Giggs]
Turn up the headphones a bit
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh shit, legendary

[Verse: Giggs]
Enemies twelve o'clock, enemies fifty-five
Tell me who on the block, tell me who is this live (who)
Tell me who's on this job, tell me who lives this life
Nigga just popped that shot, niggas is dead this time
Gully niggas, gully niggas
Pull up and we're running niggas
Everybody's running 'cause
That's what happens when you summon niggas
'Cause a nigga thinks it's playtime
Pull up on you dummy niggas
We ain't really Rich and Rico
But man are getting money niggas
Man'll pull up summertime sunshine
Pull up with them sunny niggas
Manaman a badman Top Boy
Pull up with them Sully niggas
Man'll just back that pap pap
Run up on you bummy niggas
Man ain't really into the joke ting
Run up on you funny niggas
Man'll really cop these burners
Couple of these burgers
Man ain't really too concerned with
What doesn't concern us
Man ain't really too confirming
None of these vermin
I see 'em walking 'round with that trey-pound
None of them's turning
So disrespectful
Feel so disrespected
Called up the Six God
Phone just connected
I got so many flexes
And got so many texts-es
I'm just waiting for YG
My little bro got arrested
I went home and I left it
I went home and I rested
Just wait for the bird call
I went home and I nested
Wait for the bird call
Wait for the bird call
Went to the airport
Go to commercial
Money on the table
Money on the table
Trent on my phone
Coming for the label
Coming from a life of danger
Running from the angel
Music in your bloodclart speaker
Coming through the cable
Gully niggas, gully niggas
Fuck it, fam, I'm bunning niggas
We just keep it coming 'cause
Niggas been them cunning niggas

[Outro: Giggs]
You hear that gangster shit, son?
Yeah
[?]
Bruv, big disrespect
I like that, yeah, yeah, yeah
