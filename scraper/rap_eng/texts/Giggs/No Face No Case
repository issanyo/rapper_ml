[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Dodging the case!
(It's 6 figure music baby)

[Chorus]
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face (Aye)

[Verse 1]
I break the law then I tuck my heat, do it all for my seat
Ain’t shit comin' up sweet, only these diamonds only time I freeze
You know that we gotta eat doin' this shit for my team
Never switchin’ for no cream, duck when you see that beam
Livin' the dream, rap what I seen, say what I mean, sippin' some lean
Livin' it up and I'm poppin' the trunk
And you know that I'm always serving every fiend
Pour me a four, pop me a bean, filling like I am an ATM machine
Louis Vuitton from my feat to my jeans
You know the jacket is always Supreme
I break the law, hop in my car
Big boy toy when the roof got stars
Every time they see me on charts
Pussy boys cryin' ’cause I break they hearts
Bitch, I’m a star, right every bar
Fuckin' your bitch and I’m hitting it raw
Same way that I rock out on these shoes
Be the same way I rock that jaw
Left it up and let it fly
Got my whole squad by my side
And you know they down to ride
For my city I'm down to die
Screamin' fuck the other side
Do a stick up and I slide
I just hopped up in my Wraith then I put this shit in drive

[Chorus]
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face

[Verse 2]
Ah
Please do not distract me when I step in
Goons are not reacting when we step in
Dudes about that action and I bless him
Dudes will pill you cap that Smith and Wesson
Yeah, all out soldiers, quick fool out, tired
He's warn out, charging with his horn out
A rhino with his horn out, crying that Giggs call out
Tryin’ my best not to get drawn out
Marrow will get torn out (Boom)
Live corn, big corn out
Room, because they opened his chest, pourin' out
Straight, dude just pledge your oath, I'm the best swore down
Back to the bass, back to the bases, back to the base
Clap for the races, back for the race
They tried to replace me, I'm back to replace
My under and over rock to the lace
Told her come over, back to my place
Bended it over, splashed in her face
Stepped in the Cobra, trampled his face

[Chorus]
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
I break the law, hop in the Wraith
Doing the race, dodging the case
Get out my face, get out my face
Get out my face
