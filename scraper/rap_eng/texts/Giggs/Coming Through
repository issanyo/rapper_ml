Coming one, coming two
We're coming through, we're coming through
How'd you do?
How'd you do?
Coming one, coming two
We're coming through, we're coming through
How'd you do?
How'd you do?

[Verse 1: Cadell]
And I can't be compared, too many man think they're able
To build their own table but they ain't got chairs
Watch me come and take the piss
Use escalators and lifts, won't take stairs
True say, I got the food, but I heard they got the food
So let me take his, matter of fact, let me take theirs
Got stocks so won't mistake shares
I call it financial timing, we was out repping and rhyming
But me and my Gs weren't letting a vibe in
And GCSEs don't mean you're a neek, I was getting a life in
You was steady revising
Feens phoned me for the smoke
YGs and pouches, got plenty of those
When we stand up in the war, you would've thought
We'd done the war ting centuries ago

That's just Roman, barbarians
I'll do a hit, I never brang through Konan
Krept in, that's your wifey, put her in a box
This corner kicks, rudeboy, she's a head ting
So what you tek this ting for?
Last year, could've left so many man up in the cold
They should've been dead this winter
And I don't dead lift and I ain't a sprinter
Nowadays, man get skeng for a fee
Back in the day, the only cell (sale) that I saw was splinter
Had black ops before Call of Duty
On an estate, bussing the shots out windows
Now I've upgraded, could've thought I made it
Still up in the streets, you could've thought I weighed it
Kill another beat with big bro, pull up in the four-door
All black tints though, you know how the ting go

[Hook: Giggs]
Coming one, coming two
We're coming through, we're coming through
How'd you do?
How'd you do?
Coming one, coming two
We're coming through, we're coming through
How'd you do?
How'd you do?

[Verse 2: Giggs]
This that gully gang, twist dem fingers
Drink might turn a man ninja
This that if I get that strap and bun a man
Shit might turn a man ginger
And man don't really ramp with funny man
Man's got suttin up Windsor
This that man's already done with summertime
Man'll be fucking up winter
Click click, man might pattern up, insta
Man might scan a man infa..
Red beam, your bitch
Man ah might pimp her
@ me, @officialgiggs
Holla man's Insta
And man don't really fuck with Randall's
Better run and tell Finster

Coming from outer
As we go inter
Yo, yout
Ah wah ya tell him fa?
I wanna know Lacey
I wanna know Linda
And I wanna know Jodie
And I wanna know Pinder
Buff ting
And I'm gonna go link her
I want the cash
I wanna roll pinker
I want the whole printer
I've lived it hard
But I wanna know simpler
Hollow's so cold
Hollow's so winter
She looks so good
I wanna go pinch her
Peter Pan
And I'm gonna go tinker
Call me the man
I made her body go timber
