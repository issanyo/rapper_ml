[Verse 1: Tricky]
I'm OK, bars satisfactory
My jewels, clothes, car satisfactory
Yeah, but I still get things
Cause my credit's all good, wow par satisfactory
I grab bricks when I roll to the factory
You'll get hit, let them boys try and tackle me
I'm with my pretty-faced bitch
Got the brand new Benz, call it pretty-faced whip
Bam, spent twenty on a new something
You'd probably try and kill me if you knew something
And I'm totally legit now
Just the way I dress got me looking like I do something
Put me on your old shit
Up in one minute, have it sounding like a new something
It's Tricky and Giggs
Verdict? This is just big

[Hook]
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Hit 'em and -ism and -schism it
That nigga's looking good, isn't it
That nigga ain't minding his business
I need a bitch to get busy with
Niggas ain't looking as big as this
Tricky put Giggs on his busy list
And maybe my whip ain't as big as his
But these bitches is getting in anything
I'm in the party with Tricky
Niggas is looking all cissy
Think I can smell me some pussy
I knew I could smell something fishy
I don't know 'bout her, she looks iffy
Better wrap up and rub her, that stiffy
Tricky and Giggs
Man, this is just sick

[Hook]
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
Come oucha
