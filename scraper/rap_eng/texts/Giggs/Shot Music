[Chorus: Devlin]
We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

[Verse 1: Devlin]
If you wanna play just roll the dice
Frozen I'm as cold as ice
I'll curse your life
Just like the cast that filmed the poltergeist
And call me arrogant cos I only follow my own advice
Voices in my cranium have kept me company through these lonely times
I see a load of guys that are posing like the soldier type, a load of hype
Devs I'm like intense interrogation cos I expose the lies
Like you've been on road at night
In fear of your safety with the kitchen knife as you hold it tight
Call me hot property, I'm like a house on fire I set these roads alight
Honestly, and if we're talking metaphorically
These MCs are like slim blues I use, now watch me fucking cut you's down to size
My rhymes are constricting like tights are on a fat girls thighs
I'm on this dirty vibe
I'll snap your spinal cord and severe every nerve inside
It's simpler than nursery rhymes
I'm certified, so shut your mouth and close your eyes
To heighten your hearing and appreciate these flows and rhymes

[Chorus: Devlin]
We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Yeah uhhhh
Listen
My brains too quick you can't control my life
I'm like a bolt of light
I switched it to the rap scene from a bulk of light
Me and Devs don't give a fuck, were both alike
Rolled up on the industry like a motorbike
Let's take it back to the O's of white
Me and Foss in the trap on a vulgar night
That's why I write the same shit down that Hova writes
Now all my hot 16 bars are overpriced
Yeah it's been hard for him
He made the last draw they thought that'd be the last of him
I have to laugh cos look how I switched the path on him
I've been doing this from day you can ask Colin
Little brother Clark I'll go hard for him
I'll grab a Strally and a mask for him
To light up a snake waiting in the grass for him
That's why I shot music im tryna chart for him

[Chorus: Devlin]
We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Devlin, my flow bounces back and forth
Like tennis balls in centre court at Wimbledon when the summer falls
And I don't need physical strengths to help me bend the rules
So call me Chuck Conner's son cos I take you out with Delta Force
And I'm like blasting at a vinyl, Devs I shot music
You couldn't strip me of my title, nah I'm still cruising
Just like the Titanic's ghost
I'll leave you fried like French toast
Set alight, tied to a post and left to choke on your own smoke
I'm changing letters into figures so call me algebra
And my lyrics are acidic just like the rain, sleet and hail across the city that's falling down on ya
That peasant land for land of a
The metaphor man-handler
This shit I say will take your breath away just like the fucking Boston strangler
I'm rowdier, making sure my attacks are multi-angular
To invade the space surrounding ya
A million oceans deep and now I'm drowning ya
My cards are on the table like a gambler

[Chorus: Devlin]
We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for

We shot music
Call it murder on the dance floor
And we got more bars than Wandsworth and Dartmoor
And when they ask us if we're signed we just laugh more
There's no tricks, what you get is what you ask for
