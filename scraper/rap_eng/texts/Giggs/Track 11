[Verse 1]
I told 'em I'm running the game and I meant it
Superman in the booth, I Clark Kent it
If it ain't about money I can't sense it
Remember me shotting the cats, the park bench shift
The park bench shit, tense shit, nigga the guns are expensive
Squeeze off, one of you punks in intensive
Talk about wetting the scene up, I drenched it
I'm back on that Fem shit, I'm ready to clap the Mac 10 shit
Don't get me back on that Spend shit
I watch from out of this world, the Ben 10 shit
I don't come from a happy house
I get it cracking when I roll with the Maccy out
You better know when you back it out
Squeeze off 'cos I'm gonna let the Maccy shout
Shit's mad risky, so when I hit the club I got the mag with me
Yeah I brought the suttin' in the cab with me
'cos a nigga might be buzzing and be mad tipsy
Mean mugging in the back with C
You can buy knuckles with the cartridge B
Kick back a little R&B, chicks want a picture 'cos I'm an artist D
But back to the bargaining beat
To the dope heads who's ears where the bargains be
SN1 hat, talking the hardest tee
Getting money with my Walk in the Park CD
These niggas far from street
They ain't rap stars, these niggas R&B
Yeah they went and let an arsonist free
Had a bag of straps and nigga mastered heat
