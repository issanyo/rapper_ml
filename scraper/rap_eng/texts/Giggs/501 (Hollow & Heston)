[Verse 1: CASisDEAD]
They say best go back to black
Crack and Moroccan black, go back to that
UK rap, we mashing that
CAS and Giggs on a track, imagine that
Them man's shit was sounding wack
So man had to come pick up the slack
Attract these yats, I got the knack
Grab that rack and give that back a slap
Loudpack loud as a thunder clap
Smack from Baghdad, gotta unwrap the pack
I'm a cunt, Jacques Chirac
Get your bird on the [?] and matte shellac
Donuts, flash the cash and that
Fake gold chain, it'll give you a rash and that (slags)
I don't get your rationale
Local niggas, man are international
Had to finesse ya'
Kufed up like Richie Finestra
Two gram and a little something extra
Never saw man coming like Leicester (Go get 'em)
Don't wanna go too hard, don, don't wanna upset 'em
They try infiltrate, I don't let 'em, nah, I vet 'em
Hollow and Heston
Lick man down, let them learn a lesson
"Assistant, bring in the next contestant"
Am I all there? Repeat the question
We can't be tested
Man said I'm sick, well, I best get tested
You'll get eaten, get ingested
If it ain't money, not interested
Me again, you guessed it
Not in the same group you put the rest in
Come a long way from
Robbing the Best Inn, getting arrested
Yeah I'm dead unrested
Them niggas dead and festered
Vermin, it's infested
It's a fucking cesspit

[Hook: Giggs]
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em
Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em
Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em
Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Wu-dop, wu-dop, wu-dop, wu-dop
Think we wouldn't release? I bet we would
It's big Hollow, the G, look at the crook
Author, don't need to speak, I writ the book
Drop work, pick up the P, pick up the buj
Easy, we got the keys, we got the goods
Like CAS, said we got the Es and got the kuf
We got the fiends and got the bush
Bust that, bust that, man gonna bust it off
Big ol' four five, man gonna dust it off
Hand me the dusting cloth
Man's been out there banging it just because
And my salary's just the gwop
Man smoked weed and my sanity just took off
And they're telling me not to cough
Kyze on the left and he's telling me not to stop (Go get 'em)
Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em
I got weed, I got neesh, I got girls and got lemon
Landlord, and I'm back, I cut keys, I got tenants
I cut keys, I got G, in my jeans, I got denim
Attack, attack, attack, attack (Obama)
Barack, Barack, Barack, Barack (Osama)
Man did my jeans, my tee, my hat (No drama)
I got the hits, look what the cat
Look at the kicks, look at the swag
I got the bricks, we got the madge
I got the chicks, they're monsta mad
And he thinks he's the shit but wants a badge

[Bridge: Giggs]
Momentum
I've had this on lock since '07
So go tell 'em
So shellings, onstage I go shell 'em
I get chicks in groups then go bed 'em

[Hook: Giggs]
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
Go get 'em
