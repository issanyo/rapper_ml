[Hook: Ghetts]
Tell my man I'm a general, he ain't even second in command
Tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell 'em wha gwan
I'm going on like I ain't ever read a Psalm
Ready or not, weapon in my palm, setting off alarms, so road that I'm never in my yard

[Verse 1: Ghetts]
I've got a new ting, rip an enemy apart
Just setting apart, never's on my mast, devil in my path
Telling me to go and give the metal a massage
Load it, feel it (BANG!)
Hold it, squeeze it (GASSED!)
These MCs in the grime scene, they ain't never done what they spit 'bout (LIARS!)
If I had a pound for every time that they said gun, I'd be rich now (LIARS!)
I tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell everybody with a big mouth
I ain't one of these likkle fuckboys, pay me respect - no discount
Draw my something, make the lead fly, and erase all my enemies
For tryna write me off, yes don, vest on, who told you I ruled out your headside?
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-dead guy
God forbid you make it to the hospital
Cause I'll be the one by the bedside

[Hook]
Tell my man I'm a general, he ain't even second in command
Tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell 'em wha gwan
I'm going on like I ain't ever read a Psalm
Ready or not, weapon in my palm, setting off alarms, so road that I'm never in my yard
Tell my man I'm a general, he ain't even second in command
Tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell 'em wha gwan
I'm going on like I ain't ever read a Psalm
Ready or not, weapon in my palm, setting off alarms, so road that I'm never in my yard

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Yeah, these man talking that shit with man about murder and mystery (LIARS!)
Man ain't up on that strip, got manaman purchasing 50s
I was on a ban, now I'm off a ban, so the C-class man had to purchase it quickly
I'm a man that'll put another man down under, burst if a man wanna wig me
Man might turn up with this one, turn up with that man (GASSED!)
Very important (why?), man might turn up with wristband
Back out the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish man
Run up on Giggsy? One wallop and wig man
I was chilling in the bing with a block of noodles
Now I'm 'bout waking niggas up, nigga, cock-a-doodle-doo
Bitches looking for me, wanna cop a Google
Man are pimping out here, man'll prostitute you
First they rolling with you, then they snitching on you
Then the prosecution wanna prosecute you
So now that jury's gotta drop it to you
Not guilty, ooh

[Hook]
Tell my man I'm a general, he ain't even second in command
Tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell 'em wha gwan
I'm going on like I ain't ever read a Psalm
Ready or not, weapon in my palm, setting off alarms, so road that I'm never in my yard
Tell my man I'm a general, he ain't even second in command
Tell a man, tell another man, tell the next man, tell 'em wha gwan
I'm going on like I ain't ever read a Psalm
Ready or not, weapon in my palm, setting off alarms, so road that I'm never in my yard
