[Hook : Tempa T]
Why's man goin' on like Scarface though?
My man sayin' he's bad
But he ain't Scarface, no
Running around all of the town, didn't know his Dad's my bro
Man ain't inna no trap
Tell a likkle man go home

Wanna act up?
Please man, you're just a pickney
Man ain't bangin' no skengs
Man I'm hard like a gypsy
Go home likkle pickney, home likkle pickney
Likkle man clamin' streets
When I bang my bullets don't frisbee

[Verse 1 : Tempa T]
I don't know this likkle man claimin' steets
Said he aipopped down nuff man, he ain't been in basic beef
Said he goes hard on the road, nah man he ain't chasing P's
Said he goes hard on the road, nah man he's a basic thief
Who really knows this guy, who really know this neek?
Ain't been about for a minute, touch down - better know it's peak
Listen up, your big man, true say you're just a pickney for me
Man, man said he bust bare case but he just chat for police

You could have a thousand bags
You could have a thousand bags
You could be dressed in a suit
I could be dressed in rags
Left a mans' top bare hole-y, see a man gank and stab
Man will tek with the roley's, see a man punch and jab
Man stop thinkin' it's knife, man will just punch and jab
If I punch man in the face, man will hit concrete slab
See man stand on the curb, see a man standing bad
Got two spinners on deck, man will start busting live

[Verse 2 : Giggs]
It's that ahh bloody mash that
Armed with the flow
Hard-body flashback
After the show, get half of the cash back
Dark on the road, I'm daft in the [?]
Talk on the phone, man dance in your snapback
Who's that shark on the throne, just park at the mans [?]
Who's this darker opponent, spark her and splash that
Start up the motor, park up the hatchback
It's calm on the roads, straight after he crashed that
Scar from my neck, mad sharp with my head back
Man just laugh at the rest, man's laughin' like ha-ha
Straigh Harry Hatchet, hack with the hatcher
Feds better catch up, snap with the catcher
Shit's getting flipped and slapped with the spatula
Man's got an itch and MAC be the scratcher
Pricks gettin' bricked and cracked with the fracture

Quick get the suitcase
Man's eating and you've got a toothache
Man's pullin' up like - what?
Coz Giggs got a new tape
Man rollin' up just chargin'
That Giggs in the 2 chain
Dat-da-da-dat, Dan Gorgan, back for the retake
Quick, get a knife and fork out and slap me a beef steak
Back for the replay
Scratch, I'm a DJ
Think because a man's from London, you get smacked with a tea tray
