[Chorus: Shakka]
I was born '89, Shola Ama made me
Head low so the boydem could never see me
Old bros leave town so they never see me
Now my neighbourhood don't recognise me
Inna, inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna Lond, inna, inna, inna

[Verse 1: Shakka]
The spot on Portabello made the sickest Chinese
Now the one that's taken over makes the shittest Chinese
The new neighbours never figured this loud music pays me
Now there's banging on my door and it goes-
I don't recognise my neighbours
I'm sure they don't know me either
They hardly ever say hi-i-i-i
And now the rent is getting hi-i-i-i
But I was born, raised and grown here, yeah, yeah
Like Carnival, I'm going nowhere, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Shakka]
I was born '89, Shola Ama made me
Head low so the boydem could never see me
Old bros leave town so they never see me
Now my neighbourhood don't recognise me
Inna, inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna Lond, inna, inna, inna

[Verse 2: Shakka]
They would lock off grime raves claiming they incite beef
Now it's all over the place and we're like-
I don't know who stole my lighter
Can't rave without my lighter
It makes a London boy so hi-i-i-igh
We rave in different shapes and si-i-i-ize
You naughty gyal when you're well prepared, yeah, yeah
Like are you really, really from the e-e-ends?

[Chorus: Shakka]
I was born '89, Shola Ama made me
Head low so the boydem could never see me
Old bros leave town so they never see me
Now my neighbourhood don't recognise me
Inna, inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna Lond, inna, inna, inna

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Man was born up in Peckham on the gully Gloucester
Went to school with Spencer, Mordecai and Foster
Beenie Man, Bounty Killer, Biggie Smalls and Busta
Every day in the jungle with the knuckle duster
Man had crack inside the basement
Man got slapped outside that pavement
R&B outside the station (remember that spot)
Now my block's all got replacements
Trendy spots in the jungle, that's their banging venture
When they should build a youth club or a damn adventure
They don't give a fuck 'bout mandem
If they could, they'd fucking ban them

[Chorus: Shakka]
I was born '89, Shola Ama made me
Head low so the boydem could never see me
Old bros leave town so they never see me
Now my neighbourhood don't recognise me
Inna, inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London
Inna, inna, inna London, inna London
Inna, inna, inna Lond, inna, inna, inna
