[Intro: Popcaan]
Time ticking like bomb
Big fat 'matic inna hand
Dem nuh bad like Mr Sutherland
Unruly and Hollowman

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, time's ticking
In the kitchen with Kentucky Fried, fried chicken
In the ride with the hottest chick, but I ain't kissing
Tryna hire up the pussy, fuck it, I ain't fishing
Mana rise up the bucky, nigga, I ain't dissing
Tell a man to his face, fuck it, I ain't bitching
But fuck it, back to the kitchen, nigga, fine whipping
Fine whipping, nigga whipping, nigga, wide shipping
Why listen?
9, mek the bwoy liff him
Man ah ride with that semi-9, bwoy, listen
Bucka-bye, bucka-bucka-bye, bwoy missing
Yeah, Rico, wire Mitch in
Yeah, big toast, bwoy skipping
Bully, Deebo, fly-tipping
Yeah, seat low, but I ain't slipping

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Boy don't give me chat inna mi face
Real killy, killy, buss a shot inna your face
Big fat Kalashnikov deh pon mi waist
Pussy suck ya mudda, me nuh cuss and me nuh no trace
Boy don't give me chat inna mi face
Real killy, killy, buss a shot inna your face
Giggs have the 'matic and the metric mi ah brace
The whole world know seh London ah mi place

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Yeah, wild difference
Old school, I've been on life's missions
Old school, I see online pictures
Old school niggas, couple wild sisters
Man stepped back and made a wide distance
Night time, a nigga ride vicious
White pictures, white slippers
Chess game, a nigga slide bishops
This is big business
Little off the top, well, that's a quick skimmage
Act hard but you're a bit timid
I'm just waiting on the big finish
Straight jeans, we don't fit skinnish
You want a peanut punch, I grab a quick Guinness
Bareback? Man got the big jimmies
Popcaan, I'm with the sick killers

[Bridge: Popcaan]
Yeah, di killy dem ah kill yuh dawg
And mi make yuh duppy with mi spinner dawg
Man a killy, man a killer, man a sinner dawg
Unruly, bad ah yard, and we mad abroad
We nuh play like domino or three a card
Index finger play with the trigger hard
Giggs buss your head with a zigga dawg
Puppy can't talk, we a bigga dawg

[Outro: Popcaan]
Wicked, unruly
Yo Giggs, you know the fucking ting by now
Boy don't give me chat inna mi face
Real killy, killy, buss a shot inna your face
