[Verse 1: Giggs]
Niggas better act like they know
You will get smacked in the boat
Even though I've got my strap in my coat
If I pull it out, I'll have a nigga running scared like he just saw Casper The Ghost
And I got a mad stash of coke
The trap ain't a joke
Free samples packs to promote
When I say I'm on the rasclart strip
I ain't talking 'bout a slag on the pole
Niggas say my tracks are a moesh
Boom blast, Hollowman is like an axe to a throat
My raps ain't a joke
I'mma start switching off niggas like my straps a remote
'Cos the step like they large
Raps so greazy you expect they'll be hard
They ain't even press on the start
It's all just a deceptive visage
And I got the Pecks in my car
Tiny Raver, that's my little nigga Pesky Tarras
Squeezed off and left in the car
That's the reason why the (?)'s on my arse
I'm getting messy again, this is Hollowman
And I had to holler at Blade to let the hollows bang
I know you little pussy arse niggas probably hoping that my rocket jam

[Verse 2: Blade Brown]
We roll with youngers, roll with olders and roll with soldiers
We're holding revolvers so please look over your shoulders
Stay on your toes and shit
Before the revolver spits
I'm into linking gash, you know them older chicks
I'm into making Ps, I'm into buying garms
Hold tight my niggas locked down due to firearms
We on the damn road, and we be making P's
We gonna' do this shit our own way and just make them see
The road's a joke, we damn rob niggas
And sold it all for green, brown and loads of coke
My niggas holding sticks, you niggas hold your dicks
We're in this game to takeover, yeah I told you pricks
I know I'm spitting slow, I'm trying to make you hear
I'm trying to break it down simple, trying to make it clear
We're not them other niggas, the type to get sniffed and start snitchin'
And Trident undercover niggas
Trying hard, real hard not to smother niggas
Cos at the end of the day, we're all brothers niggas
We're in the same struggle, tryna' make the 'caine juggle
We grew up from the same dirt and same rubble
Listen, the streets are gritty and grimy
I got the city behind me
I like the things that are pretty and shiny
(like, gritty and grimey
I got the city behind me
I like the things that are pretty and shiny)
Listen, and when it comes to my money man
Get it correct, I don't shot any more, I just collect Ps
Collect bills, collect G's
I want my money upfront, I want correct Ps
Make nines blow for lines of poke
Dubs beat Barley that's the only grinds I know
(Like, that's the only grinds I know
Dubs beat Barley, that's the only grinds I know)
Lets Go!
