[Hook: Example]
You gotta look over your shoulder
Cos they don't teach that shit in school today
Just remember what I told ya today, today, today-eh-eh-eh
Just because you've gotten older, it don't make you wiser
Best keep your eyes up uhuh
Just remember what I told ya today-today-today

[Verse 1: Giggs]
This shit ain't easy as you think it is
This ain't an accident, neither a coincidence
I'm bringing money to this rap game. Im like the light That creates the photosynthesis
I take life with a pinch of it
Smoke weed, you can tell the way I stink of it
My mixtape, the best in the street
See me on the road tell me what you think of it
Now what d'you motherfukers think this is, give me a mic im'ma show you what distinctive is
Fuck a top ten, I'mma break a record show you nigas what olympic is
Fuck that niga' and the whimp he's with
Get the money now, later show them what the simpson is (maggie)
Bag full of 50s
Showed it to my nigas said they can't believe how pink it is

[Verse 2: Giggs]
(listen)
This that look over your shoulder part-t-t
This that soldier bar, nigga this that joan of arc
I think the street life stole my heart
The nigga that I used to be, we done grown apart
The first time that I stole a car, me and Lap went glocester we had loads of laughs
Shit changed I had to soldier march, all the way into the pen, cuz I know my past
I chose a path, number 35 from nothing fam I choose the chart
Showtime, couple thousand singing 'look what the cat dragged in', yeah they know my bars
I told the white people and I told the dark, and it ain't a racist thing this is no remark
Try'na keep the music and the road apart
I'mma give it everything I got this ma only chance

[Hook]
