[Verse 1: Giggs]
Hit them with the facts
Hollowman's out here living in the trap
A little bit of this and a little bit of
The feds nicked me I got imprisoned for a strap
It was shootings
Every minute listening to rap
'02 got shot, couldn't pass the three
That's when I got locked, feds were after me
It was hard to see
I was half a G
It was all guns, drugs, girls and Master P
My main two thugs that'll blast for me
Knuckz and Carlton they'll go hard for me
I'll go hard for them and they seen that
Between the two of them they know I'll go hard for each
Fam I'm half the streets
And I'm half a beast
But when I get pissed off Kyze pass the piece
Even Fes licked out couple arteries
Heading nowhere fast 'cos it's hard to eat

[Hook: Joe Grind] (x2)
Ain't got shit to prove
Niggas know what I do
Who are you to judge me?
You know what I been though?
You see me in nice clothes and you think my life's smooth
I'm a weed in this world and they want to cut my root

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I'ma hit them up again
Life ain't easy sitting in the pen
Or as a young black man living in the ends
I know twelve year olds that be wishing for a skeng
If they get one they'll be licking at your friend
Niggas plotting on me, got me visioning my death
Niggas smile in my face but they wishing I was dead
If you think I'm so fake come and lick it at me then
I'm swearing to God I'll be in it to the end
You can tell by my pain that I've seen shit
Had a little gun charge yes I've been nicked
You say you ain't seen me
But if you've had a shootout with them Pecknarm G's
Then you seen Giggs
Got me as some crime boss 'cos my team's big
If you're talking OG then my team is
Easy off on my penis
I'm about to fly high, I can feel it

[Hook: Joe Grind] (x2)
Ain't got shit to prove
Niggas know what I do
Who are you to judge me?
You know what I been though?
You see me in nice clothes and you think my life's smooth
I'm a weed in this world and they want to cut my root

[Verse 3: Giggs]
From the pissy blocks
To the sickest spots
I'll be up in Stringfellows where the strippers cotch
And the strippers watch when I issue rocks
And I'm always on time I ain't missing shots
I ain't slipping 'cos
Them little pussy cops
Got me standing on the edge but I ain't slipping off
Might clap a hater who's got issues 'cos
My mad stack of paper's like a tissue box
I use to roll to mystical, use to listen lots
Now it's all Hollowman screaming give them rocks
Who's that trying to say 'Ummmm' what a big impostor
Niggas know me 'cos yes I'm an official mobster
And they know my co-d, that's my nigga Foster
Got the dust game smashed we should get an Oscar
And we don't need cats 'cos I'm trying to prosper
I'll be linking architects and be meeting doctors
