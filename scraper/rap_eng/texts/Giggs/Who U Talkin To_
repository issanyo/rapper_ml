[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah (yeah)
Dun know fam
Fuck you know about the fucking PYG's
Pecknarm Young Gunners
Me myself Hollowman
Fucking boss
Spen in the fucking building
Yeah, listen

[Verse 1: Tiny Boost]
We're the youngest in this Pecknarm squad
Got my black bandana so I'm Pecknarm'ed off (off)
Lap gave me a message from the Pecknarm boss
Saying come lay something straight hard, not soft
Pecky niggas repping for the hardest block
Fuck about and get your top, half ripped off
When we ran up in your park, your little hearts got shocked
Keep shouting fuck 'Narm, 'til your ass gets shot
After the trap, holla at my nigga J
'Cause I know for a fact he got a jezzie we can lay
I don't give a fuck I'm getting paid
And any nigga fucks with my dough
Then that bitch is getting sprayed
'Cause round here my niggas don't pull stunts
We push grinds, load clips and pull guns
'Cause round your bitch, you little bitch niggas just talk nuff
But when you're in the 'Narm you little pricks keep your jewels tucked
'Cause we're tooled-up

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?

[Verse 2: Lap + Giggs]
I'm the crazy one, the madman of the 'Narm
Younger Lap, yeah I got the murder in my arm (murder)
Headtop busser, machine in the palm
Lemme find out who you spitters are
Spitting to the D's and selling out your ass
No talking, I'm letting off the sparks
My hollow tip is taking out your heart
And the rest of them are ripping you a part
I got big boy dogs on my team
SI and PYG
Black bandanas on loading up the heat
Duppying anywhere, even in the streets
We're hard, you don't want it fam
Leave a nigga on the floor seeing holograms
You know we come hard, so holla fam
Me Darks, Boost and Hollowman

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?

[Verse 3: T.Darko]
It's the new mixtape, BoomBlast yeah I'm feeling it (Feeling it)
Me and Young Lap on the strip, we are beating sticks
Vietnarm got this locked
And I got the faggots on my arse all the time, the stick stays cocked
I've had enough of this prick, I ain't fucking around
If I shoot at a punk, then he's touching the ground (Touching the ground)
Should've known this, Pecknarm Town
Big dogs, so fam you best forget that frown (Frown)
I murder in the strip, bursting the shots
Squalay on my case so I'm swerving from the cops (Cops)
Big niggas think they're hot (Hot)
Iced up chains tuck it in or It's gonna get popped
Tiny Darks is what they're screaming on the blocks (Blocks)
Hard bars coming so they're telling me not to stop (Not to stop)
Lines moving fast so I'm picking up the rocks (Picking up the rocks)
Shots hollering, so I'm splitting it to dots

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
These are Pecknarm G's
Who you talking to?
This is PYG
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
Who you talking, who you talking
Who you talking to?
