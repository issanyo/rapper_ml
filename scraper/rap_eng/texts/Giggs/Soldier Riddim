[Verse 1: Giggs]
If it weren't real talk then I wouldn't rap
Niggas talk real greazy but it's all an act
Ain't nigga in my team that I wouldn't back
Front, you can get a concussion from a wooden bat (UUMMM)
All your mandem are full of chat
There ain't any nigga in your team that I wouldn't slap
My bandana's fully black
Black SN1 t-shirt and a woolly hat
Now you can catch me on some G shit
In Stringfellows I'll be up on the G list
Getting a c-flip, getting a free strip
Half Philippines, half Vietnamese chick
Hollowman I'm putting 'caine on the street for paper
I put my pain on a sheet of paper
Fuck around I'll put your brain on the street you hater

[Chorus: Giggs]
Best rest your mouth
Don't stress me out
You know what happened when the nine got tested out
We're the best there's out
Better rest your mouth
Don't stress me out
You know what happened when the nine got tested out
We're the best there's out

[Verse 2: Tiny Grem]
Survive through your rain like wellingtons
Don't talk bad's what I'm telling them
Russian Makarov will around smelling them
Anyone sweats? I put one in the head of them
I'm trying to see my bones stand like a skeleton
Five sides to my niggas like a pentagon
From two grand to 10 bags I'll be selling them
Tryna see my shoebox worth many men
Niggas mention my name like they know me
I just cross them off my list like old beef
Gloves on but I'll clean them off you know me
Then back it up in a cabnet like a trophy
A word of advice don't disrespect
Cause low whistle on the end will make your sister deaf
I'll surely get you in your shoulder if I miss your neck
T.G's really here, no sniff effect

[Chorus: Giggs]
Best rest your mouth
Don't stress me out
You know what happened when the nine got tested out
We're the best there's out
Better rest your mouth
Don't stress me out
You know what happened when the nine got tested out
We're the best there's out
