[Giggs: Talking]
Yeah, dun know
It's more than emotional
This right here proves Boom's the hardest

Aaahhh!
Boom Productions!

[Verse 1]
A G woke up phone right by him
Had a couple missed calls, last nights clients
Yawning scratching ma balls, Rocks rang sighing
Said he's got the lowdown on this prat Ryan (Yeah?)
I'm like "black Ryan?" (Yeah)
He's like "that Ryan" (Aaaahhh)
I'm like "wrap tie him, deep fat fry him" (Uuummmhh)
Jumped up getting gassed by it (gassed by it)
Said I'm coming on the ride, so I sat by him (Yes)
Strally tucked and I'm ballied up
Rocks black cap, black clothes looking Daffy Duck
Get ma strally out, of my coat, raised the strally up
If I see this faggot in the cut, I'm a grab his nut
I'm a grab a touch, bust a gut, let you grab a slug
Little mothafucks, insects, I'm a flatten bugs
Let you fuck with Buck, fling Tecs, in you faggot mugs
Show you little cunts in depth what ma 'matic does

[Verse 2]
Jumped out on foot looking
If I catch this little prick I'm a six foot him
No pigs looking
Something like a live PA, this a big booking
Over there, there's the prick, jookin'
Got the toaster heated up for some quick cooking
Didn't even squeeze the trigger, heard the pigs pull in
Didn't even hit the nigga, cause the pigs took him
Tryna get away from the Jakes, feeling flipping bait
Tryna get this eight crime scene with the sticky tape
Tryna slip away, might mean gotta hit a Jake
Rocky hit the brake, went left, threw the stick away
Feds are closing in, no stick, you're too flipping late
If they saw the stick, get dashed, that's a different game
Whiplash from the switching lanes
Rocks you're gonna crash, oh shit, hit the flipping brake
