[Verse 1]
Cause we them niggas, respect the soldier
This is SN1, nigga, respect the folder
I was in the trap, man had to get that phone up
Money wasn't right, man had to get that boulder
Winners, Courvoisier, get the cola
Man'll paint the town red, nigga, get the roller
Try to sleep on Hollowman, accept the coma
When you're talking UK rap, nigga, respect the owner
We're back, I had to get the phone up
I was swerving in the whip to go and get them doughnuts
I was bumping Master P, man had to get that zone up
Had about a half a ki, man had to set that loan up
Me and Clarke [?] expect the roll-up
That was random, round the time we was upset with stoner
But that was way back in the day, nigga respect a grown up
Now I hit [?] go and get a gold up

Winners (nah, no one's doing it like this, no one, come on)
Winners (winners)

[Verse 2]
Now we're them winners, early morning
Early morning shopping, call it early balling
Cooking up that breakfast cause she heard me calling
They call me the director, must have heard me stalling
Winners, long coat, Uncle Fester
Never gave a shit and never under pressure
Top progressor, heavy, nigga, top professor
But get it with the lobster and a spot of pepper
Jumping over niggas, watch me drop a cheque up
This that all around the world, that puffy makes it better
Run up in your kitchen, nigga, shake your chef up
Tell him go and get that get up or we're making ketchup
Winners, make a cheque up
Yeah, the doctor's in the house and it's a brick to check-up
SN1'll make a tape just like we're making meth up
Push my willy down your throat and fill your naked neck up

[Hook]
Winners (that's mental, mental)
Winners (I might have to give 'em the next, shall I?)
Winners ('ight, let me bless them again a little)
Winners (let me see what I've got left in the tank, let's go)

[Verse 3]
Winners, I so direct it
Better watch your mouth or man just won't protect it
Yeah, that nigga's bad so please just don't respect it
I'll make hooks like du du du cause I just don't respect it
And she's like blah blah blah and I'm like hun, just text it
If the email's looking money, man might open message
Take a look at all these niggas, man, we so progressive
Tell me where the money at and I'll just come collect it
