[Chorus]
I'm really down, I'm with it
These niggas really down to visit
My itchy finger's down to fidget
I bring the fizzy round to visit
Rounds are rigid
Cause I've got them pounds, them digits
I told them that I'm down to bridge it
All these niggas round me's legit

[Verse 1]
You're down to diss it, I'm round and with it
I'm back, strap, run round, you whiz it
All my niggas down for cricket
These niggas coming round for chicken
You cut them pictures down for clipping
I know my way around the kitchen
I know my way around the whipping
I put that Scotty down for Pippin
I pop that shotty round for slipping
I pop my pocket out for dipping
I pop my wallet out, so tipping
I copped that bloody brown for flipping

[Chorus]
Down, I'm with it
These niggas really down to visit
My itchy finger's down to fidget
I bring the fizzy round to visit
Rounds are rigid
Cause I've got them pounds, them digits
I told them that I'm down to bridge it
All these niggas round me's legit

[Verse 2]
I was down in Peckham
A nigga's coming round for seconds
A nigga's coming round to stretch 'em
A nigga's coming round to tek 'em
Everybody's down for lessons
We just drop 'em down fi left 'em
Now I'm stepping out, fluorescent
Everybody's coming round for sessions
And I've got that loud possession
My bro just knocked, who dat? I Steff 'em
And a nigga proud to eff 'em
I've got soldiers and I'm round to prep 'em

[Chorus]
Down, I'm with it
These niggas really down to visit
My itchy finger's down to fidget
I bring the fizzy round to visit
Rounds are rigid
Cause I've got them pounds, them digits
I told them that I'm down to bridge it
All these niggas round me's legit
