[Verse 1: Krept]
All about the British Sterling
Can you not see, the cars German
Put my money where my mouth is, cause my grands are high
Fuck the talking dog, this ain't family guy
Yeah, my hood's nuts, mind how you speak here
Cause them 2 9s, will make you leap, yeah
Yeah your jewels shine bright like a diamond
Round here, if you shine bright, you could die Mond'
That's the hood, nigga, don't take it personal
If they let them rounds off at your circle
Don't underestimate the youngers lurking the strip
Think their things are drama till they murk all you pricks
The same ones that you Salaam could be the ones to draw the piece on you
Youths wanna poke a man, girls wanna peek at you
If A bad B likes what she C's, she'll get the D from you
E don't give a F, he'll stick you up and take a G from you
And you can't call police
If they stick you with that knife
You better fork the Ps
From the narm to the hill down to Thorton Heath
Where they'll 'nap a man (why?) for talking grief
So focus on the money, road life shit
Now my bank balance's looking like mileage
And my clique buy bottles, what are you on?
Them broke niggas buy cups, thats a boob job


[Hook: Giggs (x2)]
What's these niggas gonna do when I stick it on em
What's these niggas gonna do when I stick it on em
Click it on em (click it)
Whip it on em (whip it)
Slip it on em
Get Bloodclart wicked on em


[Verse 2: Konan]
(Yeah)
Went from a ringer to a ringtone
Could have ended up in pen for the [?]
Change to the plimsolls
You know how the thing goes
Bruddahs doing birds
Phoning me off the wing phone (Behave)
You could get bottled for a cheap shot
Dirty money, yeah my bruddahs really see rocks
Tell him ease off
Bars ill [?]
So don't be moving funky round my crazy cousins (Oh yea)
Now I got them rapping all my bars
Little begs call me 'cous' but family we aren't
Thinking back when I was out there
Jacket and my mask
With the canon in the car
Like I'm hanging with Jamal (Kaboom)
Have you on the run
Four hours pussy till I got the cunt (Kone)
How could I go lidge?
Ribena in my fridge
I was still out robbing sons
All the grief from police with the 'let me live'
From a rugrat was itching to pepper pigs
Out there on the roadside all day (why's that)
Cause robbing man for Os was my forte
They can't chat to Giggs they can't chat to Krept
Boom bye bye old school racket set (Kaboom)
Fuck getting bad, that's a bag of stress
But I'll still thief your watch if you're aqua fresh

[Hook: Giggs (x2)]

[Verse 3: Giggs]
What's these faggots gonna do when I stick it on em?
This that traffic warden strap, stick a ticket on em
Niggas stuck cause shit go'ne go get sticky for em
Blow that fucking shotty through his back, did it Ricky for him
Oh Mama have to mac it
Little Riz, Chief Keef catch them man in traffic
If I want your life, send a bunch of man to snatch it
Man, I got the custom made air force matching with the jacket (I had to)
Got that wotzit nigga
Better watch it nigga
What's the gossip nigga?
Wanna step up to that bridge, you better cross it nigga
Feeling like this the prophesy and I'm that prophet nigga (oof)
Hood fella, Hood breddah
Old school, Woody Woodpecker (jheeze)
Phone call the little hood repper
Got that crazy petrol, call it hood pepper
On a violent hype
Creep on a silent night
Bitch niggas got me boiling up like a pilot light
I don't really like to talk to the confiding type
So all you'll really get from me is goodbyes and hi's
Mac fully spread
Back of his head
I just left a hell hole
I'm back from the dead
Thought he was invincible, he actually bled
Put that bit of work in then back to my bed

[Hook: Giggs (x2)]
