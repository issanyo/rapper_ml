[Intro]
I'm a humble G, but got younger G's (yeah)
Middle of the Nam, where the jungle be (yeah)
But that don't mean that they're under me
It's more like a family and I'm just uncle G (G)
Got the ganja tree (tree), getting bumblebeed (yeah)
My brother YG and my Uncle P (Uncle P)
I want my niggas locked up in the dungeon free
So they they light up the weed and get drunk with me

[Hook]
Yeah I'm full time, I ain't half loyal
So all you half-hearted niggas make my heart boil (yeah)
Hard headed brother that they can't foil (foil)
Stone cold fucker, I'm a Gargoyle (uummm!)
I'm a Gargoyle, nigga I'm a Gargoyle (yeah)
I represent the dirt like I'm part soil (soil)
(look) Nigga I'm a Gargoyle
Crack a nigga's head, even if it's hard boiled (blam!)

[Verse 1]
Do they want it with, niggas that be on this shit
It's nuts how it's gonna get, this is how you wanted it
I'm ready to die, niggas got me on that Warlord shit (yeah)
Pass the strap, nigga this is how you wallop it
I'm always on this with, niggas that be on the strip
Show them that this isn't the way that niggas wanted me
But if I got love for niggas and they're on the field, they ain't gonna slip
Imm'a show this little nigga, this is how you polish it (And it's real)
That distinctive rap, yeah that Maggie Simpson's back
Cuz i've never been a prick, don't know why you're thinking that
If you niggas think you're old school, where's your wrinkles at?
See the killer in my eye and you just bought the twinkle back (uummm!)
Father to the game, you can call me Vincent Matt
Nigga ran up in the  beef, now it's got him limping back (haha)
They're say I'm getting sick again, yeah I got them symptoms back
Gave these niggas Hollow's flow, think it's time to pinch it back (chays!)
Thinking back to the days when, we were linking that
Nigga with the straps cos I always had a inkling that
We were gonna beef them cos, I know where their thinking's at
Life's a bitch I'm smiling at her, noticing she's winking back (nah)
Papa's on this ting, hope you got your strings intact (yeah)
I'm just popping in, show them niggas Giggs is back (ooff)
Told 'em I'm the fucking rap dad, of this thing in fact
Lapped these niggas hundred times, you can call it sprinting rap (nah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a Gargoyle, God damn it
You ain't the boss of me, nigga this is God's planet
Took a bite out of the game, look at this dog's damage
Niggas act macho but,  niggas is not savage (not savage)
That nigga just got cabbaged, I got niggas out there non-stop at it
You ran were? What planet?
Niggas so bait, mans' squash maggots (yeah)
Couple months back they though they had me outfoxed
I was up in 'Marsh, locked up on house block
Walking round the yard, telling littles how these niggas' nerds
Little shits, kinda similar to what a mouse drops (ooooooh)
Well I'm back now, watch these niggas' mouths drop
Niggas better relocate or get a house swap
Think that you're a man because your little Brussels sprouts dropped?
You can ask around they'll tell you we don't fuck about cos

[Hook]

[Outro]
That's how it is for man (truss me)
Real life shit, isn't Disneyland (rap it up Giggs)
And haters have it in for man
But we'll see how that works out, this is gym for man (nah)
God turned my life around, made it spin for man (truss)
And chicks want a photo, want to Instagram (chays)
And everyday is win, win, win for man
Do it for the soldiers that's in the bin for man (truss me)
