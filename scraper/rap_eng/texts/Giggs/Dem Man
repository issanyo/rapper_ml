[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, ahhh
Them man are at it 'cos man are at it
Bang 'em my niggers cannon adicts
The pussiest niggers think that they're the Agger at it
Dickheads, lose a couple these niggers get all fraggle at it
Lost for words
Scrabble at it
I ain't buying the flow but rock a swagger jacket
These niggers are all swagger jacking
Rice Crispy snap pop crackle at him
Let me take you back to all these niggers that
Disrespect man turn up to where the niggers at
Get a ten pin on a nigga and push the skittle back
If I pop half on this nigga I hope I ain't missing that
These niggers are all kitty cats
All talk these niggers are all titty flaps
Peckham on the back of my hand, give him a city slap
Sounding like I'm ready to die, flow on a Biggie track

[Hook: Giggs & Kano]
Them man will do it, can't man do it
They say I can't but I show that man can do it
Man sticky how a man glue it
All of the gangsters put up their gun and hand to it
Them man ain't living how mans living
Man icey but can't catch man slipping
Man's chilling see the man's slippers
So tell a man mind their damn business

[Verse 2: Kano]
Fake rap silicone, sell a soul, ring a tone
As niggers told, rigatoni up in my niggers bowls
Boss man's soprano's, puff Montecarlo's
Gansgter, Movado, hard dough
Bread and make them breaders from the naan though
Success, sex, stress
Read a nigga's palm bro
Set to make the cheddar like a grew up on a farm
Yo Yungen, wah gwan? Fuck it, let the pussy think he's Pablo
Yeah me love my car, me love my ice, me love my Nando's
Death bed I am stating Bible and Qu'ran though
Kelly Brook quickie or a sniff Nicki Minaj bro
Yo fuck it, tomato tomato
Spit and paint a picture, call a nigga Leonardo
This the last supper for you fuckers
Touched a brother's button so it's war now, fuck about with numbers
Difference between fighters and the lovers

[Hook: Giggs & Kano]
Them man will do it, can't man do it
They say I can't but I show that man can do it
Man sticky how a man glue it
All of the gangsters put up their gun and hand to it
Them man ain't living how mans living
Man icey but can't catch man slipping
Man's chilling see the man's slippers
So tell a man mind their damn business

[Verse 3: Kano]
When it comes to battle call me Arnold
Big ting, yeah, I go commando
You know the devil tries to get you when your heart's low
I told him go fuck yourself until his arm's broke
I heard the government's been on man through the barcode
Them DVD's will make you never leave the yard though
Pussy galore, see them inspire our shows
James Bond suit cuff links
Let the clerk show we run the game

[Hook: Giggs & Kano]
Them man will do it, can't man do it
They say I can't but I show that man can do it
Man sticky how a man glue it
All of the gangsters put up their gun and hand to it
Them man ain't living how mans living
Man icey but can't catch man slipping
Man's chilling see the man's slippers
So tell a man mind their own business
