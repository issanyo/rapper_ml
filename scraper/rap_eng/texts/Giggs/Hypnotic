[Hook]
I dont feel no way about it
My heart is big and cupid, has shot it
Now all of your movements robotic, hypnotic
And whatever you pick, you got it
X2
You got it

[Verse 1]
I think I got an epihany, if she break my heart again
Thats it for me, sike
I could fall over and over again and Im still gon get up
Its like riding a bike
I got a new name for thotties, I just call em Pauly
The way that they ride in the night
From the west to mo city, we got them birdies
They singing like Brian Mcknight
I was born in 95, the Rockets was live
And RnB music was real
So they call me Sanboomkid or JohnyyLovve
I know that music can heal
Ever since was an infant, I ain't ever tried to fit in
Baby girl missed her period, thats a real life sentence
Im a real life Ben10
Every month im fighting monsters
Never been to a convent, but all my demons gettin conquered
I might throw another concert
Just to silence all these con-men
Together we can move a mountain
Cmon man Cmon man
Its Ramen Im findin every time I need a plate to eat
Remind men about Jah and I know heaven got a place for me
Everything's bigger in Texas and thats a true statement
Cause this is the state for me
Shoutout to Guapo I feel like El Chopo
I really just wanna escape in peace

[Hook]
I dont feel no way about it
My heart is big and cupid, has shot it
Now all of your movements robotic, hypnotic
And whatever you pick, you got it
X2
You got it

[Verse 2]
If lovve cost then I can't afford it
X3
