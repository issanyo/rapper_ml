[Verse 1]
Straight from the bottom of the compass
If you don't already know me fam, this is Hollowman
And you know I keep it thorough
And, these niggas ain't out here but you can believe I am
That's why the scumbags follow man
So there's been a couple occasions where a nigga's had to swallow grams
Throw food, borrow grands
So I've gotta soothe my pain with a lot of gam
Nigga I ain't no bitch
We can have it out like Jolie and Brad Pitt in Mr and Mrs Smith
'Cause I'm rolling with that stick
5 seconds, it can be over with that quick
I'm aiming for your wig so I'm hoping that that splits
If your chick talks shit then I'm slapping up that bitch
I'm erratic when I flip
So you don't wanna see me with a Mac and a fat clip

[Chorus] (x2)
I'ma give it to 'em raw
So fuck the industry
They won't let us in, we'll be kicking in the door
This is our game now, our turf now
We should be pissing on the floor

[Verse 2]
Creeping my brain
The reason why my shit's so hard is because I'm releasing my pain
Snitches out there tryna weaken my game
In the police station speaking my name
I'm tryna get that belly
You niggas ain't on paper, you're on chickenheads
Famalam forget that jezzy
Food's scarce so I'm tryna stretch that coke
But when papi hollers back I'll tell him "get that ready"
I'ma beat the strip black and blue
The way that food's scarce, I've been slacking
I've got some catching up to do
Begging me for more, that's the kinda shit my rats'll do
Ask my clientelle, I've got fantastic food
Niggas talk a lot of shit
I don't talk, I just bring the action through
So count your lucky stars I'm in a happy mood
This ain't everyday shit, pussyhole, 'cause I ain't a happy dude
That's the reason why I don't do happy tunes

[Chorus]
I'ma give it to 'em raw
So fuck the industry
They won't let us in, we'll be kicking in the door
This is our game now, our turf now
We should be pissing on the floor

[Verse 3]
I come with immaculate shit
Niggas conversating like "Gig I can't get over the crack that he spits"
Obviously you get them dickheads just watching man's shit
I'll tell you what, find a chick and relax off my dick
Keep the whistle on the steel
Or I'll just send Carlton and Spen through
Nigga they'll be pissing in your grill
You're running up and down with Pinocchio niggas
'Cause you look up on a star and you're wishing they were real
These other rappers' shit's difficult to feel
They're saying it's their life but I notice certain bits are from a film
I'm old school nigga
Whilst you was at home watching cartoons
I was hustling, licking me a till
I've been through every damn thing
From the bottom of the barrel to doing the damn thing
They wanna lock us up like we're doing a bad thing
So them Trident dickheads plot on getting me back in
