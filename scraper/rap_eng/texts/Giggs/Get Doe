[Chorus: Sizzle] (x2)
Get doe in cash loads, we get doe
Get doe in mash mode, we get doe
Get doe, we get doe, we get doe
Get doe, we get doe, we get loads

[Verse: Giggs]
Peckham ambassador
The cocaine cartel, Pecky man mafia
And the trap's got me violently smashing the
Packs out fast no denying this trafficker
Knucks in the back, big Foss in the passenger
Low from the rats and the camouflaged camera
I ain't an amateur
If you strip ain't been taken over yet
Niggas better know that I'm planning to
And my music might actually manage to
Get me out the game, let me explain
Like me spitting in the can, presto, crack in the canister
Get doe and wet hoes
Mets know, big guns we press loads
Elevate, cock-back and let go
Now I've gone and just messed up your best clothes

[Chorus: Sizzle] (x2)
Get doe in cash loads, we get doe
Get doe in mash mode, we get doe
Get doe, we get doe, we get doe
Get doe, we get doe, we get loads
