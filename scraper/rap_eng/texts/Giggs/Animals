[Intro: Fix Dot’M]
Bayoz Musik
I run this mother fucker, Gigg, Wooly
Cameron on the keys, Unit 10, Darkman on the beat
Dot’M with this speech, I’m hard
Wooly, wow, mixtape out but I wanna sell units
Oi I’m on a hype, gotta give them the hard shit init, yea

[Verse 1: Fix Dot’M]
Look, I'ma find out where you sleep
Catch you sleeping there
Run up on you, gun up on your cheek
What you keep in there?
I’m the kinda one to let it squeeze, so don't even dare
Unless you wanna bleed and float in the air
Oh please, the toaster will flair
Couple compliments will get let off and go to your head
Listen I'm hard I'm overly bless
Armed like first nigga movie and first nigga dead
Try fuck with me, not good, I’m fuckery
Eat with the metal and shit, but not cutlery
He stays selling the piff, I got customers
My speech, ain't you heard of a gift, I thank God for it
Too much swagger nowadays, I got people talking, they be like
"Dot'M what kinda top is this?", question mark
And I'll be like "honestly, look there's the yellow bird", I ain't gotta speak
I ain't gotta say a word, I just does the deeds
And I stay on curb, cause it’s got the piece
Listen I’m the future, what they want is me
Slumped but in the future I’ll be running things
With 2 straps on me like some dungarees
And I’ll have you niggas running like some running game
Look, I'll run circles round you, focus dawg
Wet something up like Squirtle out of Pokémon
I will hurt ‘em if I poke someone, so I just burst and give ‘em an open lung
Listen, you should hold your tongue or man will come round (tch tch) unload for fun

[Chorus: Fix Dot’M]
Blades, hammers, grenades
Apes, animals aim the thing at ‘em
And flame ‘til the spring back and you skate
To the same flat where you weigh the same packages
Day to day and that's the way behave fam it's just
Blades, hammers, grenades
Apes, animals aim the thing at ‘em
And flame ’til the spring back and you skate
To the same flat where you weigh the same packages
Day to day and that's the way behave fam it's just

[Verse 2: Fix Dot’M]
Blaze faggots, I reign I may stab ‘em
Niggas know the 4.5s my main cannon
I spray for lame manners, the pain I blames talent
Straight UK, but I make the name balance, YES!
Like man can't dump, I've got live skengs, can't front
Niggas fool, when my triggers pulled
Bigger balls than one in white men can’t jump UMMM
I ain’t slipping over here Fix, na, pump action put him in the air shit
Rip him like a bear shit, splitting in my rare kick
Jump in my whip, then I’m gripping on the gear stick
Feeling like I can’t speak and I can't eat, when a nigga violates me is where I can't sleep
Ask Buck I was ringing him at half 3
Telling him about my big dog with the sharp teeth (ask him if you don't believe me)
Think my black gang's bollocks? Real G's every day black vans follow
I'ma make a black gang promise, if I see that little prick
SMACK, BANG, WALLOP, UMMM
Commercially hot, but did I go commercial? Certainly not
I'm still a real gangsta, so before I go inside my house I circle the block
Lyle & Scott, purply top, Unforgiven aftershave, squirted a lot
Black SN1 hat, bird on the top
I'm that sex icon, birds wanna watch, YES!

[Chorus: Fix Dot’M]
Blades, hammers, grenades
Apes, animals aim the thing at ‘em
And flame ‘til the spring back and you skate
To the same flat where you weigh the same packages
Day to day and that's the way behave fam it's just
Blades, hammers, grenades
Apes, animals aim the thing at ‘em
And flame ‘til the spring back and you skate
To the same flat where you weigh the same packages
Day to day and that's the way behave fam it's just
