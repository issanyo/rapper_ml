[Verse 1: Giggs]
Who? Me? Top gang banger
Me, Knucks, Spend, rolling in some whack banger
Baseball cap and hammer....Black bandana
And I ain't happy that we're gunning
I was happy in my yard, practically buzzing
Now I'ma get some practice while I'm bucking
30 minutes after Knucks phoned me for the suttin'
I'll be on some major violations
Everybody ducking, a couple faces on the pavement
Bleeding like a bitch, mum's crying in the station
But that's the consequences of a major violation
Once I get the engine started I'm off
Paranoid, hit my destination, park in the block
Now I'm thinking bout my karma with God
But when I link back with my niggas, we'll be laughing it off
Fam I'm moving sick and always have been
Still bucking over niggas now but I ain't a has-been
Always on a mad ting
Way before straps
Violated me, I grabbed him, stabbed him
Fam I don't business 'bout you you dumb rookies
Bitch niggas from you popped out of your mums pussy
If you touch Boogie, you will get bun'd fully
Victim of the slug that I shoved in the gun ?

[Verse 2: Blade Brown]
Still picking up O's of crow, man that's worthless
Catch me on the phone giving orders to the workers
You be on on the block with the clowns and the actors
Catch me on the roads with the ballers and the merchants
And yeah we got that barley flake
So peng I swear, make 'em do the Harlem Shake
I've got the heart of a lion
I bark off the nine for my partner in crime
The block's hot and the hood's fire
These bitch niggas are some good liars
They're always lying to themselves
Never bussin' off the iron, it's always lying on the shelf
This is a joke ting for fucks sakes
This industry is full up of clowns and cupcakes
No time for niggas who are moving bait
I'm on the grind, I got figures to accumulate

[Outro: Joe Grind]
Damn
Giggs, Blade, Joe Grind
I weren't even on this man, I just wanna get credit
This tune's a fucking banger
Can't bang like this, so don't even fucking try
Spare
You niggas know the work we do man
Banging shit
Bang, gang
Damn fam
