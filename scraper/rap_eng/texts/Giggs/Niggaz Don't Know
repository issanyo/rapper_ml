[Intro: Giggs]
From the top fam
Spare No-One
I had to give myself a round of applause
I've been coming hard lately
Boom Productions
He's been coming hard lately, definitely

[Verse 1: Giggs]
I keep my mind focused on the struggle
I know that there's a big piece missing in my life
So I'm focused on the puzzle
I feel my life's hopeless but I juggle
I'm chilling with the yack and the zoobie
So I toke it and I guzzle
I'm out in the trap with a few dots
The feds jooked me down the other day
So I suffered some food loss
I'm the definition of true boss
When hear me mention hammers
I ain't talking bout the shit in the toolbox
Niggas know I've hit up a few spots
Trust me though fam, there's a lot of sharp teeth in my two dogs
The way I put it down, I should school bods
SN1, God damn, there's no way that my crew's soft
I'm done with hard white, now my food's soft
Now every drug dealer wants to know, who do I get my food off
Before I hustled, couldn't even cop me a few socks
I'm coming from the bottom, but the haters are soon topped

[Chorus: Giggs]
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about Griz
These niggas don't know about shit
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about shit

[Verse 2: Kyze]

[Chorus: Giggs]
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about Griz
These niggas don't know about shit
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about shit

[Verse 3: Joe Grind]

[Chorus: Giggs]
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about Griz
These niggas don't know about shit
These niggas don't know about hits
These niggas don't know about Giggs
These niggas don't know about Kyze
These niggas don't know about Trigs
These niggas don't know about shit
