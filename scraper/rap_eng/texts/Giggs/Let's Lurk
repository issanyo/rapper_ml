[Verse 1: Monkey]
Still pulling up on smoke (smoke)
Skeng in my pocket, can't you see the bulge in my coat? (bulgy)
Like Hollow Meets Blade, manaman got guns that'll sink down a boat (boat, boat)
Send a young boy round with a skeng
They ain't leaving till they see smoke (bow-bow-bow-bow)
My niggas the realest in town, you niggas are really some jokes (fucking jokes)
Feds locked bro watching EastEnders; it's a fucking joke
(Free bro, free bro)
Trapping ain't dead, the nitty still clucking and ringing my phone (ringing)
Chilling with bro, talking 'bout money, dough to the dome (money)

[Verse 2: Dimzy]
Turn up on your block, ten toes, man will do it, no plan
Man will do it, no plan
In four-door trucks, I took risks, man, soon gon' bring out the chopper in the van (skrr)
I was in the trap on Snapchat watching everybody turn up mad (mad)
Can't lie, that shit got me mad but I was hugging up all them bands
Just done road with Snoopy (trap), bare Uncle Fest and amm
Got my face all droopy, bro got guap like Gucci
See him in Stoney, not Gucci (Gucci)
The ops used to laugh at my truck but they cut when they see that hooptie (skrr-skrr)
Whip that skeng out the coat, watch it sink like Susie (bow)

[Hook: LD]
Still pulling up, no messing (pull up)
67, my brothers
Spare no one for my bredrins
Bitches be loving the gang
You see it all over my mentions
Put things in the car, let's lurk (all of that)
We ain't looking for normal pedestrians
How you gonna do man dirty? (how)
Got things on things and we lurky
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certy (gang)
How you gonna do man dirty? (how)
Got things on things and we lurky (lurky)
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certy (all of that, all of that, all of that)

[Verse 3: ASAP]
I've got mad hate for the undies
Moving like gyal, tryna cuff me (dickhead)
.44 spin, that's rusty (mad)
And the corn is chunky (mad)
More time, I be in the trap
With Chris Brown and Rita Ora
All the in and outs
To go hit the cells, it's hot like a sauna (flame)
So I switch the trap
Flip the packs, I need all the mula (all of that, all of that)
Wahgwan for the judge?
Done the mandem dirty (mad)
Free up my young G Pulloff (free 'em)
Chopper on the ride, that's lengthy (mad)
Fifty shot, the skeng's full up (mad)
Niggas do the dash when man pull up (dashing)

[Verse 4: LD]
Still outside drilling (out 'ere)
Bro's came home from the jail, bought him a phone, then he made him a killing
Ops dem know where the hill is (6), they ain't come around here (no)
Raise both arms up figure eight, that's two.44s in the air (bow)
How you gonna do man dirty? (how)
Bro whips that grub, man a whip that skeng
Got me feeling like Shirley (whip)
Went from a twenty-five shot to a fifty shot
We don't know about 30s (yeah, all of that, all of that)
Any time I phone my plug
Better know that call's nothing less than a birdie (all of that, all of that)
Put skengs in the car, then I phone my bro like "let's get lurky"

[Hook: LD]
Still pulling up, no messing (pull up)
67, my brothers

Bitches be loving the gang

Got things on things and we lurky
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certi' (gang)
How you gonna do man dirty? (how)
Got things on things and we lurky
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certy (all of that, all of that, all of that)

[Verse 5: Giggs]
Get lowdown, tell a man straight
Man already know, 67 and H
Three, four, five, six, seven man rolled up
Three .45, 67, man ate
Man just rolled up, pepper then doughnut
Two .45s then severed man's plates
Man's just colder, everyone load up
'Cause in this jungle, everyone's apes
I want everyone's cake
Man play hero? Bury man's cape
And there's bare subliminal riders
So what's everyone saying? (man's sayin'?)
And man ain't even on these games
But I noticed everyone's playing
And I don't even need no soldiers
Man know Hollowman's spraying
I've never really been on that running shit
Niggas know Hollowman's staying (woof)
And way before all of this money shit
Niggas knew Hollowman's name
They love it when I come on this gully shit
Niggas know Hollowman's lane
They know a nigga bring that next level shit
Nigga, call me Hollowman Saiyan
