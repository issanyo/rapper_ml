[Verse 1: Giggs]
Man's the nicest
Old school nigga that bangs devices
She's telling me I've got handsomitis
And thanks for the invite, man's delighted
Got the gangster license
You can get in cheap, those handsome prices
They will never know just how gangster life is
Like little young niggas holding shanks in ISIS
Yeah, man's finished
You think it's all funny till a man's in it
Your niggas locked down got you on the phone
And you ain't tryna waste up all a man's minutes
And niggas banging out, moving mad silly
I remember feeling pissed when they bagged Jimmy
The amount of times I've seen my friends
Laying on the floor, dead, chills, mad chilly
So I clank some glasses
Cause man's still standing here thanks to Marcus
And man ain't like all these wank-dead artists
Cause to get where they got, they had to spank some arses
Man just get up and a man just marches
Man just set up and a man surpasses
Man pear tree it so I brang the partridge
Wanted jewels from the garden so ran to Clarky's
They already know, man's in it
I bag shh and I bag thingy
Fat philly, had to drop it out
Couldn't have my little son like "dad, bring me"
Sad singing
MAC ringing and the strap spinning
I'm back, billing round the back, chilling
I Gohan on a whack Krillin
The stretched arms for the fat bringing
It gets dark when the MAC's swinging
The crack breddas and the cat women
But rap's got me round the back swimming
It's that nigga, nigga, rap's in him
Tap niggas out and back pin him
Get your figures out and back bend it
Stick your finger out and man, sing it

[Hook: Aystar]
The last ones left
Always kept it real, that's why the rats are vexed
Always kept the steel in case I have to step
And straight back out the ting and put a cat to rest
But they love us because we rap the best
And they know that man are trill the way we get mad respect
If a nigga violates and then the phone line connect
To bring the TEC, the TEC'll separate his head from his neck, listen
(They already) Mad ting

(They ain't gonna catch me)

[Verse 2: Youngs Teflon]
Roll to the club in my tracksuit
Babes, I don’t need to act like a bad yout
I’m the underground voice of the black youth
We carry firearms, man are strapped youts
Told the plug that I'm made for this
I took a whole one, I didn’t pay for it
Next summer, I need 80 bricks
Treating 2016 like its ‘86
Far from perfect
I even tried work once, now I work it
Hella real niggas in my circuit
I know two man ready for a burstin'
Peng tings call me J
The bro n 'em just call me gang
The OGs see me and they show me love
Cuh they know I’ve been trill since the pram
Eating black peas, will.i.am
Spending quality time with the fam
Real Gs do what they want and they have to
Halfway crooks only do what they can
Missing all my darg, got a few in the can
I smoke amm and I’m a new, different man
I had juice while you were sipping juice out a can
I bought a 4s but used to share a deuce with my man
Ahh, shout H for the link up
This some shit they couldn’t think of
My man never leave it at home
He ain’t sipping no yak like "why you came to the drink up?"
My girl got a big butt
And big lips she can lip lock
I tell her she the shit but
I’m still smashing other chicks in my flip flops
Mummy used to send me Kwik Save
My PayPal just saw a big change
I’m about to get my own kicks made
My brodees pull up in the big Range
I switch flows like a switchblade
I’m a wild one, straight out the south side
Niggas got fat while I starved, now it’s our time
I take my job serious, it’s never part time

[Hook: Aystar]
The last ones left
Always kept it real, that's why the rats are vexed
Always kept the steel in case I have to step
And straight back out the ting and put a cat to rest
But they love us because we rap the best
And they know that man are trill the way we get mad respect
If a nigga violates and then the phone line connect
To bring the TEC, the TEC'll separate his head from his neck, listen
They already know, mad ting
Look, we bag both and we clap tings
The MAC-10's filled up with hollows
It's best you have some tef on your chest before these shots cause a mad ting
You're fucking with some vets and not the type to put your pet down
We need a new spot to put the TEC down
From Toxteth to Pecktown, real niggas get down
I run up on a nigga, spray him from his head and neck down, nigga, get down
