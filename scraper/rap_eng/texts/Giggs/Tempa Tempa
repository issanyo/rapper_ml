[Intro]
"What's happening?"
"I don't understand"
"I'm sure you don't Jane"
Temper Temper
That was your crime
We've been watching you for some time
We knew that you'd appear
We knew your temper tantrums would lead you here
"Stop! Leave us alone!"
"Pray silence for the judge"
"What judge?"
"All rise!"

[Hook] (x2)
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast

[Verse 1]
Got a bad temper and my gangs with it
If I click it it's only cause my hand fidgets
I ain't talking bopping by, where my gang visits
If I catch your pussy face, Imma Stan Smith it
Niggers walking round on foot, trying to bag pitches
Under-covers wanna look, I can't stand snitches
Look see the bogers on my foot, looking Stan Smith-ish
And my swagger's looking good, that's why I bang bitches
In a hot spot, where the cops watch
I've got straps masked up like its not hot
Couple Glocks copped, I will not stop
Fam I got a lot of arms, call me Doc Ock
If I hop-scotch, to your Pop's spot
Bust a top lock, fuck a knock-knock
Got my strally out quick, move it chop chop
Niggers talking any shit, get your squad dropped

[Hook] (x2)
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast

[Verse 2]
Hear the tyres screech first, then the fire heats burst
I got two knifes, Imma  put in Siamese work
Let it fly in his shirt, let him lie in his dirt
This the jungle, where the fucking lions eat first
You can't test me prick, I'm a let tee rip
Blow your brains out, on some fucking pesky shit
Never lets me slip, an interesting clip
Lethal weapon here, feel the fucking Jet Li kick
Never met me, but they wanna get me pitch
Feds arrest me, they don't wanna let me live
My performance didn't wanna let me spit
But when I swallow food they wanna let me shit
Niggas hyping like there on some pecks green shit
Ive got lighting, blow you into next week quick
Now your blood's floating, on some fucking Red Sea shit

[Hook] (x2)
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast
Temper temper
Caught you at last
Your quick temper went a bit fast

[Outro]
Real niggers with no patience, pesky, snaps, younger even you dun know
Let them little pussy 'oles know
This is a place of woe, this is a place where all wicked children...
