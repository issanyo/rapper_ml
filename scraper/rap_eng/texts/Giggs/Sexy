[Verse 1: Giggs]
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's flexy (yeah)
Man got me a 9, and she's etchy, she's sketchy
If man just send that flyin', bet it catches (mmm!)

[Verse 2: Pressa]
I just brought a 9 to protect me (my safety)
I got a Rollie, need a Patek Philippe
And I use my wrist more than she could text me
Big gun extended clip, Glock, Glock, Glock thirty
Crate just came in, go for the trolley
Pussy get free smoke, if you wanna polly
Kill a nigga, never saw me
Slide on a nigga, no hockey
Got my eyes in the rear view
Feds wanna box me
If it's thin, we need all them figures
Tie his ass up in his comfy slippers
Tre-8 spin like a propella
Probably pop up at his babysitter's
My life a movie, played in Thriller
Giggs' get to shootin', that's Reggie Miller
Look at my new Glock and her sister
Drop a man in the street, body litter

[Chorus: Giggs & Pressa]
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
Man got me a 9, and she's sexy
