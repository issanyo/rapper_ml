[Verse 1: Buck]
My advice? Don't ball air
To rap, shubs been bugging me all year
I'm on a righeous vibe, I'm all ears
But if you violate, I might haffi give the all clear
Tryna avoid shots licking
Cause we ain't really down with the politicking
Kind of dudes got me tripping
I'm with my Nigers, three words, [?]
It's all garbage, bag a chat
Giggs like Buck, manage me, you don't haffi rap
I ain't down with that wack fame
Buck, 'bout to go Diddy on this rap game
Went from stabbings, bredders tryna lunge at me
To doing films with Big Mook out in Hungary
Through the back door, I slipped in, thought I just starred in it
Nah, I wrote the film Victim
Effortless, shirt I won't mention
YMC bottoms with some two-tone Grensons
Stylish, flash bod
Sushi [?] conversating over black cod
It's like Shakespeare, Macbeth
Kick-Ass 2, my nigga played Black Death
Come a long way from pushing that loud
I'm on the red carpet with Muslim Baloch
One nigga, three chicks
Wooly hood, shouting out "free Fix"
Old school, nangs out, first in
No rest for the wicked, up first thing

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Might burst in
Niggas up, putting that work in
And my lawyers just putting that perk in
I thought I might bring it in person
Confirming that chauffeur
Watch this bread, just burning that toaster
YG's posted, serving that poker
Watch that ting's short skirt on that sofa
Might turn a man over
No blackjack when man's turning that joker
Back of the whip, just turning up Oprah
Buck's on the phone, confirming it's kosher
Few little improvements
You should take note, these niggas on movements
How can they teach when niggas just students?
Some niggas smoking, man, they're just users
Man, niggas just clueless
Niggas ain't sick, man, niggas just flu-less
Watch a nigga get nasty spitting this mucus
Maybe you should feel privileged, this is exclusive
Talking 'bout niggas included
You ain't invited, this is intrusive
Niggas so rude and you ain't been through shit
Niggas went boom and blew up since Unit
