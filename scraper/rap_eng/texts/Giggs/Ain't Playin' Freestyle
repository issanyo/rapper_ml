[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas (straight up)
I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

[Verse: Giggs]
Way deep down in the dungeons
Humble, way deep down in the jungle
My young dargy's down, could let off that pound
And put a beat down on a mongrel
I whizzed past, span round him a little
Smacked down and just put some Ps down in a bundle
Put it down in the diary, the second week down
That's when a man slide in Rapunzel
And when you're putting no work in
No work in, then wild niggas rumble
Let the strap click, burst him
In person, I get fire and the gun fall
I let the strap click, curse him
It's turfing, it's tiring an uncle
And when the MAC spits gherkins
Disperse him, creampie-ing in your crumble
Snakes and tigers
I'm a lion in the jungle
I was alone but a rider
Peace flying, then they crumple
Little loud with your gun talk
Yo, I'm on my gun talk
On the phone
(Niggas ain't playing with 'em)
I'm replying to the gun call
Shit's getting bait now
Could take nigga's plate now
Been running this game
It's coming to hit you straight now
It's gonna make or break
They're gonna make niggas break out
And where the menu at, darg?
I'm putting names on the takeout
Bunsen burner, Bunsen burner
Deathly's brother, Uncle Murda
