[Verse 1]
Got killers beside me
Got villains in front of me
Got shooters all round me
That's familiar company
And them niggas wanna bump that gangster
I've got millionaires bumping me
I'm not kidding with some of these jokers
I want billionaire companies
I clocked bitches discovered me
Took pictures and cuddled me
I told Melanie cover me
I'm just keeping her company
I've got niggas locked up, some lifers
And I can bet you they're bumping me
Because a nigga ain't never sold out
With that bippidy-boppidy
Hickory dickory, dickory dockery
I've been dicking these bitches down
She got dick and she's jocking me
I take it back to when a nigga sold white
I ain't taking these Dohertys
Yeah, that mythical brilliance
I just kick it in Sokratis
About a million messages
A couple millions watching this
Cause I wanted them properties
Man had to run up in offices
Man had to get the MAC, slap that beef
Man had to run up on sausages
Man had to drop the bloodclart Landlord
Man had to run up on soppy shit

[Hook]
MAC's just there
Now the trap's not far, bro
Shit's already breaking bad
Man, I'm the rap Gustavo
Man smacked through radios
Like crack through cargo
Man, I'm the rap Gustavo
The rap Gustavo
Rap's Luciano
Rap's new Marlo
Rap's new Pablo Escobar
And slapped through Narcos
You get clapped up, the get back's hard
Yes, rap's El Chapo
Man roll up and eat that food
And clap two tacos

[Verse 2]
It's like they didn't respect man
And I just couldn't respect that
Hit 'em with the quick top ten
I bet they didn't expect that
It's like a nigga went takeoff
It's like a nigga went jetpack
Nigga just picked up the game
And then a nigga just left that
Clap, clap, clap, clap, two caskets
My yout, jump back, two classes
Headmasters back to [?]
My yout, run back, two passes
I told a nigga go and get that yak
And better splash two glasses
Cause I'm the rap Gustavo
I've got the MAC's advantage

[Hook]
MAC's just there
Now the trap's not far, bro
Shit's already breaking bad
Man, I'm the rap Gustavo
Man smacked through radios
Like crack through cargo
Man, I'm the rap Gustavo
The rap Gustavo
Rap's Luciano
Rap's new Marlo
Rap's new Pablo Escobar
And slapped through Narcos
You get clapped up, the get back's hard
Yes, rap's El Chapo
Man roll up and eat that food
And clap two tacos
