[Verse 1]
Nostradamus, we just sopranos
Walking round in my plush pyjamas
40 cal might adjust da dramas
We bought 'em down, them lucky charmers
I got big shoes to fill, they're nothing like little girls' feet
You wanna sleep on Giggs? There'll be a nightmare on Elm Street
They're planting seeds, them fucking farmers
They're reptiles, we touch iguanas
Let it rat-tat-tat, let it rat-tat-a-tat-tat
I had the racks on racks and had straps in a rucksack
Hollowman breaks it down, yeah I'm that nigga Mack Dad
But still got dem baby mama dramas, she wanna nag nigga nag nag
You know that nigga Clark, you know that nigga Mad Man
You know that nigga move, fresh home out the trash can
Free my little bro YG, now bang your doors, nigga, bang bang
They wanna ask "who's dat?" You know dat nigga Batman

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nostradamus, feeling fucking marvellous
Can't deal with stress from them fussy partners
Bagging up, dusty palmers
She ain't a ho, but she fucked regardless
Man are eating big food, it's nothing like little girls' teeth
But still went west end and got a nice little belt cheap
Then met a one hot chick who took a nice little selfie
I got the game on lock, I got my name looking healthy
Nigga, stick to the script, better stick to the scripture
I had her tits in my face, and got her lips in the picture
I got hoes all round and got your bitch in the mixture
They wanna ask "who's dat?", that's what the bitch niggas whisper

[Hook]
