I'm out there I'm I'm I'm out there
I'm out there I'm I'm I'm out there

[Verse 1]
They got me back up on my mad tip
Real nigga shit slap it in my hand shit
You should back up off the gang shit
One shot will make them rap him in a blanket
Niggas ain't never ever rhyme shit
Yeah they rap good but they ain't rang shit
When I speak motherfuckers understand it
'cos I'm talking that gully nigga language
I'm talking that fuck them other man shit
Get your money up put that butter in your sandwich
Nowadays I raise up a couple grand quick
Shows overseas can you drop a nigga Stansted
I still drop a nigga standing
Don't get me on it that ain't even where my plans is
You ain't living in a land with cold hearted niggas that will suffocate and strangle it
Niggas got to toughen up and handle it
Choices I made I'm kinda lucky that I rhyme with
I don't give a shit what another fucking man did
I could touch [?]
Strally on the gang tip
[?] when I handle it
You motherfuckers getting lucky when you bang things
And I don't need no one to stand in
You run your mouth and I can tell you never plan things
Niggas want straps but they never put the grands in
My last new ting I put a couple fucking grands in
And it's the way we got to live and that's the sad thing
The devil's out there and he's been hustling
All the bullshit's got to stop
My last album went hard they never wanted pop
I gave niggas and bitches what they want a cock
Straight hard shit I ain't never rap lollipop
Little hating black golly wogs
You ain't never heard a verse where I've gone in soft

Unit 10 the fucking best
