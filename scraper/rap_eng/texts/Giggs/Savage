[Hook: Giggs]
He's a savage, he's a savage
He's a savage, he's a (savage)
Easy cabbage, easy cabbage
Easy cabbage, nigga (easy)
Get 'em down, nigga, get 'em down
Out with the bloodclart, the metal out, MAC-11 spreading out
Pulling up, then getting out, man let the gun spark and jetting out
(B-b-b-b-bass)

[Verse 1: Giggs]
He's a savage, he's a savage
Easy cabbage
Man's been banging out from them days
When Dizzee was garage
Down there killing with "Man Don't Care"
That cinnamon's magic
Man's just chilling and man's just air
And billing them baggies
Fam, I used to ride out
Let it buckubuckubuckubuck
Now I'm bringing him bare
And let him cut a little off the top
I don't fuck with none of these youts
These little niggas fucking soft
Hollow's never begged nothing
But these little niggas sucking cock
Niggas better speak up
I've got niggas chilling out in the jungle
And they just wanna eat stuff (rocks)
They ain't gonna tweet stuff, but
Niggas gonna see stuff
Niggas gonna know gang-banging
Ain't nobody teach us
I was in the dead green Daewoo
Looking for the pizza
Now I'm getting money for this art shit
So I give 'em Mona Lisa
Niggas better keep up
In it for the cheese puffs
Now they're calling me the Landlord
Come and get your keys cut
Real niggas in the place
Yeah, b-b-b-b-bass
I was bussing on my ting
And bringing in the bass
I've got niggas in their graves
And niggas in the gates
Nigga, go get the food
And put it on the plate
Man rang it on 'em
Swang it on 'em, bang it on 'em
Man's Yosemite Sam-ing on 'em
Sandwich, little salmon on 'em
And man don't deal with no panicking
Man just get to planning on 'em
And Hollow's got them five elements
Man go Captain Planet on 'em
Silly little buster
Gully nigga structure
Man's just doing man dirty
Go and get the duster
Bang, bang, nigga, bang early
Niggas getting touched up
And everybody knows man's certi
So free my nigga Nup Nup

[Hook: Giggs]
He's a savage, he's a savage
He's a savage, he's a (savage)
Easy cabbage, easy cabbage
Easy cabbage, nigga (easy)
Get 'em down, nigga, get 'em down
Out with the bloodclart, the metal out, MAC-11 spreading out
Pulling up, then getting out, man let the gun spark and jetting out
(B-b-b-b-bass)

[Verse 2: Kyze]
They don't know bad stuff
They just know gassed up
But they're looking like steak to a lion like me
When I'm back in Madagascar
Let it ratatat, yeah, let it ratatat
Straight animal when I'm back in man's habitat
Moving mad and that, MAC go tadadat
Family said they thought I would change and they're sad and that
Brap brap, brap brap
Big nose ting, Shabba strap
No joke ting if I'm backing that
So Pecknam, I roll ready to crack a jack
Dun know, I'm unloading and clapping that
Swear to the whole globe, no fanny rap
Turn the heat up, no fan and that
Even the savages say it's a savage act
So who's Kyze? Who's asking?
I'm GBH ammunition and gun charges
See me late on a mission with one target
PPK like James, I dun dances
Casket bastards, no chances
Like the guy who killed Scarface in the glasses
Thinking back to the car chase with your cartridge
Take it back to the blood stains on your carpet (old school)
You little gang whore, you don't know gang war
Might circle a property for the Landlord (Giggs)
Let one go and then bang war
Man been a banger on the ends, that's what I'm banned for
Real nigga shit's what I stand for
You man couldn't stand with me, you'd get a stamped jaw
Dem man can't see me for damn sure
Superman Krypton shit and man's Kandor

[Hook: Giggs]
He's a savage, he's a savage
He's a savage, he's a (savage)
Easy cabbage, easy cabbage
Easy cabbage, nigga (easy)
Get 'em down, nigga, get 'em down
Out with the bloodclart, the metal out, MAC-11 spreading out
Pulling up, then getting out, man let the gun spark and jetting out
(B-b-b-b-bass)
