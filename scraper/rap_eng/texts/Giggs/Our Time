[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
Man's still married to the game, no wedding
Still lay a bredda down, no bedding
Still flying that flag, still repping
Kick down doors cause we weren't letting
Man's big man, after I fed him
Should've left man begging
Should've told man get him (Where's my man?)
I should've left man guessing
Man's pissed when they see man swegging
This bitch wants to blow man's head in
So I tear that in 07
[?] hope she never got pregnant
MCs shook when they feel man's presence
This man has all the [?]
Don't speak to me, all of you's peasants
Best salute to the lieutenant
Fuck your past when man's present
You're myths, man's legend
Your bitch, if I want her
Should be here in seconds
Don't ask how much shows I'm getting
Don't ask how much dough I'm getting
Don't ask how much creps they're selling
These haters are so upsetting
You're pissed, man's just shit
You're pissed man's legit
You say it to man's face
But you're pissed if man flips
Don't ask me [?] I'm living
Don't smile cause my bro's in prison
Don't nod like you see man's vision
You snakes, I could hear man hissing

[Hook: Joe Grind]
This our time
This won't be like last time
Cause last time
Man was kids just living the fast life
Man had bitches man used to pass round
Sticks just waiting to club man
Still got sticks but them man see our sound
Yeah, see Giggs and Joey and calm down
This our time
This won't be like last time
Cause last time
Man was kids just living the fast life
Man had bitches man used to pass round
Sticks just waiting to club man
Still got sticks but them man see our sound
Yeah, see Giggs and Joey and calm down

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Push it in
Was that pussy wettened?
Hollering, I'm kind of spraying that feeling
They're like [?]
Man open up that door
And man push 'em in
Tell niggas line up
And man's pushing in
Just look at him
Just look at him, look at him
Ten bags for a show
But man's booking him
I've got CEOs, execs
And they're looking in
I'm just whooping 'em, no sweat
And keep cooking 'em
Hollowman is back
And he's booping 'em
I'm antisocial like Reg
Big mook on 'em
I said whooping 'em, I said cooking 'em
I said booking 'em (what else?)
Stamp my authority down
I'm Big Foot-ing 'em
Big spliff
And big soot in 'em
I'm like Batman
This shit's shook on 'em
I don't care if they're shaved
Or got bush on 'em
Man'll tell a bitch shush
And then gush on 'em
