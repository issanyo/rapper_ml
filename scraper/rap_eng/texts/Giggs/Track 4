[Verse 1]
The petrol's big and the matic's long
Out on the street all night like a vagabond
Nigga's think they're greazy, wave my magic wand
Puff, cuff quiff like the ragga song
I shocked the whole UK and niggas yapping on
Thinking that they're ready for the throne like my static's gone
Fuck a happy song
Nothing ain't good, niggas gotta get it cracking on
Better show your boy, can't you see the ting bulging out that's my bulky toy
The AK makes a load of noise
Breeze out and not the new shape but the older toy
As a yout man I rolled with the older boys
Now it's time to turn my swag on like I'm Soulja Boy
Wrapping up them fat rocks
Fred Flintstone, boulder boy
Active and dropping
Black gang, gat get it popping
Bat man and chop him 'cos they yap and they gossip
Creeping through the night, Batman and Robin
The flat's looking modern
Food six out of ten I back my deposit
Hit the club, Dom P, splashed all the profit
Fucked a couple lighties that cap for the sausage
Told them I wouldn't stop for sure
Kicked off the whole thing, they couldn't lock the door
When the older youts used to try and bully man
I always looked them dead in the face I couldn't watch the floor
That Niko got layed out, couldn't stop the four busting off, thinking to myself I could of stopped a war
Fuck that, let me drop the law
Wet his top some more
