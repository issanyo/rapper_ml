[Verse] 1
Hard work pays off
I'm coming from the hard white grind pays off
I'm Still here got a praise God
Seven day a week grind no days off
They actin like they don't rate [?] but i made something of myself then i made off
These other spitters got no longevity
So i hope they didn't quit their day jobs
I put mad work in this rap shit but everything i do always seems to get played off
I'm coming from a place where it sprays off and niggas running around strapped trying to play God
I ain't sayin I don't like these stars
They get their [?] love when i work twice as hard
They think they know about pain with their lifeless scars
I'm on top of the game i am [?] hard

[Hook]
Ner Ner Ner Ner Ner
Look what i made from this crazy life
Ner Ner Ner Ner Ner
I ain't got a number one but don't believe the hype
Ner Ner Ner Ner Ner
People say they like me i got that greazy vibe
Ner Ner Ner Ner Ner
I make silly noises because that's what i'm feeling like
