[Verse 1: Tiny Boost]
And I'm rolling round Narm with my hood tied
Black bandana darg, that's my hood sign
If you know about me, I'm the hood type
Man willl wheel-round your head like a pushbike
Little dickheads coming up, tryna push by
Mind I'll push your lung back with my hook knife
Or I'll pull my gun back, make your hood fly
You can get a one slap with my good .9
And I'll be stepping on these faggots
Caught in a drought, so you know I'm stretching out a packets
If you wanna have it out, I'll be pressing on the matic
Let you have it in your chest, slugs ending where your back is
Wrapping up the 'caine in a cut up bag
Left that nigga in pain with his cut up back
Niggas moving all bait with their fucking act
You fucking mad? Act up, I'll let it touch your hat

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)
Let you have it
Let you have it, let you have it, get the matic
You'll be running like a rabbit when I grab it
When you saw me rolling up you know I brang it
I let you have it, you little faggot

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Pulled up in a scatty drop
Walked in the scatty spot in a baggy top
Spen's got a bally on, niggas backing off
First sign of movement then the maggie coughed
Niggas start to move active, ran and dropped
One nigga tried to shoot back but his banger dropped
Motherfuckers move slack, little faggot mob
While I'm moving digital, niggas analogue
Mack cocked, fuck a strap in a sock
Roll up, jump out like a jack-in-the-box
Earlier on, when I was back in the spot
I felt the clip jerk, every time I'm slapping a shot
Got a packet of gwap
Got the packs out, Lap's got the crack in a pot
And I'm mad 'cause Knuckz going back in the box
So niggas act up and blood's gonna splash on your squad

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)
Let you have it
Let you have it, let you have it, get the matic
You'll be running like a rabbit when I grab it
When you saw me rolling up you know I brang it
I let you have it, you little faggot
