[Chorus: Gunna Dee] (x2)
Down they go
The breddas that talk shit 'bout barking it off
When it gets down to it, they ain't barking it off
When it gets down to it, cuz we're barking it off

[Verse 1: Gunna Dee]
These pigs want me in the cell
The feds, are tryna clear our spots up like Clearasil
That's why they wanna follow man
I don't really wanna run, but if the federali come?
I'll put a new meaning into 'Running Man'
I'm on any crime, anytime
Any beef I've got the metal crease like Ginuwine
My niggas call me Gunna Dee
These bitches call me Dan The Man
I got them calling out my name like I'm the candy man
I'm still the same, I'm still obvious
Going in raves with chains and still popping yours
She knows my name but who gives a fuck?
I never came for fame, I came popular

[Chorus: Gunna Dee] (x2)
Down they go
The breddas that talk shit 'bout barking it off
When it gets down to it, they ain't barking it off
When it gets down to it, cuz we're barking it off

[Verse 2: Kyze]
Nah these niggas ain't barking off
I'll run up on him, stab em up
Then go home and just laugh it off
Yeah fam I'm laughing, what?
Your mandem are a laughing stock
They don't want it with the Narm
'Cause war's what we're the masters of
And you don't really want me logging on to clowns
Shit's only gonna end up with some boxes in the ground
I'll run up in his house and then I'll box him with the pound
Take away his line, tell him his line expires now
Pecknarm, you don't want us wyling out
You'll end up in the curb, or end up dying in your house
These dickheads don't like me, why don't they try me now?
This new suttin's about, and I'm dying to try 'em out
Yeah I'm dying to lie 'em down
Send him to the Lord and hope the law don't find me out
Ain't going in, I'm hiding out
After I've barked off, Kyzer Soze is signing out

[Chorus: Gunna Dee] (x2)
Down they go
The breddas that talk shit 'bout barking it off
When it gets down to it, they ain't barking it off
When it gets down to it, cuz we're barking it off

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Tinie and TB yeah they're part of my squad
A couple other hungry niggas are starving to rob
And we don't trust the rave scene so we party with dogs
I'll blow your fucking brains in, let you bargain with God
You don't wanna piss the bullies off
Pecknarm nigga, but you know I've got some Wooly dogs
Riding on some niggas, and I'm thinking 'can we pull it off?'
No half-hearted beef, it's fully on or fully off
And the D's on my back
And I'm contemplating on just how I'm gonna pull 'em off
What they're gonna pull me for, where they're gonna pull me from
Creep through the trap with my suttin and my hoodie on
I'ma touch them clowns
Turn the smile on your face upside down
Me and my niggas buck trey-pounds
They're only strong in numbers, I'ma cut them down

[Chorus: Gunna Dee] (x2)
Down they go
The breddas that talk shit 'bout barking it off
When it gets down to it, they ain't barking it off
When it gets down to it, cuz we're barking it off
