[Intro: Suspect]
Watch and chains really expensive

[Verse 1: Suspect]
See me in the flesh
My watch and chains really expensive
See me in the spot
With your bitch
I wonder what she did for that guest list
I wonder what she did for that V.I (P)
I wonder what she did for that neck drink
I wonder what these pussy niggas think they could do when a man's pullin' up flexin'

[Hook : Suspect]
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what

[Verse 2: Suspect]
Trill shit coming out of your speakers
You know how I keep it (one hunna')
Barely doing this rap shit
Young nigga still eating up features
You know my stilo (know my style)
The S-Boy spit mean shit
I remember trappin' out stilos
Knob kept falling off the gear stick
Now a nigga gon' pull up in some peak shit
Big whip make a young nigga wanna take the scenic
Man are gettin' money
Drinkin' water, makin' all these niggas sea sick
I wish a nigga would man
I'll take him to the cleaners
I'll make a bitch nigga feel it, ay

[Hook : Suspect]
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what

[Verse 3: Giggs]
I'm coming with the big bad force, course
I'm coming in the big bad porsche, horse
I'm coming with the big man talks, course
Your honey wants to dip man's sauce, awks
Don't make a nigga get Star Trek, wharf
I'm coming in the shit man walked
The Landlord was a hitmans 4th
'Cause nigga is the big bad wolf
I wonder what
I wonder what
Pussy's encrusted
I wonder what
Pussy got busted
Pussy got played up and dusted
Pussy got trusted
And I'm with Suspect and Buck
Everything's mustard
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
Think I want the trousers and I think I want the top
Yeah I heard there was an opening and I think I want the slot
I ain't really with the games though
Bitch you want the cock or what?
I wonder what
I wonder what
Man's 'bout the, 'bout the plug
Man's rowdy and bowdy
Man's 'bout it, 'bout it cuz
Man's flexed, grabbed Steph
Man's out, step out the club
And man's fresh, man's 'bout the, 'bout the dove

[Hook : Suspect]
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what, I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what
I wonder what
