[Intro: Giggs]
Yeah
(Skeptik, you filthy bastard)
Yeah, them man are all...
Them man are all...

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, them man are all creeps, stalkers
Man be taking out talkers
Man be making shit awkward
Man be taking out authors
Man be taking out culprits
Man be walking all corporate
Man can't offer man no pills
Man be taking out Morpheus
Man be taking shit cautious
Man just break in whips, Porches
Men tell lies on them mandem
Man's just making up porkies (fake)
Man's just making up bullshit
Grab the strap and go walkies (bap)
Man be moving all porkish
Then a man get poked up and porkied (yes)
Man's drowning
Man was grabbing that snorkel
Man be moving all awful
General soldier, that's corporal
Man's got everyone thinking
Man just made this shit thoughtful
Man just changed up this whole shit
And that just made man immortal
Yes, normal
Thanks for making shit formal
Man's got fans up in Scotland
Man's got fans up in Cornwall (cleanup)
And just made this shit floral
I've got fans that take this shit oral
I said "babe, come jump in this portal"
I've got whores just acting all whoreful

[Hook: Mikill Pane]
This is way too hard for them
We make it hard for them
They build it up, we shut it down
We're making niggas start again
This is way too hard for them
We make it hard for them
They build it up, we shut shit down
We're making niggas start again

[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Not "Talking Da Hardest"
When I talk about the unfortunate artists
That ask to record with the sharpest
I reply no, real flatly, Lord of the Dance shit
Tell me I'm heartless, call me a bastard
When I refuse what they send to me
But too many niggas arse kiss, crawl up arses
All I see is human-centipedes
But man ain't down with no brown nose
My Mac ain't down with those downloads
These niggas don't stand up next to me
Its like man are just out here without toes
Got a beanie in my home, without clothes
Go deep in her throat like Altose
She doesn't speak but she's never got her mouth closed
And she rides me so well, I've got her Ralph clothes
No need for jokes, there's no banter
I don't speak with hoes, I'm no Santa
I get chicks that don't talk after dinner
They know I ain't leaving home for no catch-up
Couldn't get one, then I'm a trend setter
And all of a sudden, my life just gets better
And all at once, vaginas get wetter
So it's all for the bangs, I'm like your hairdresser
All I do is give them what they're wanting
So its fair hair/here even if she's not a blonde ting
But a chick wasn't on tings
I was her last resort, she used to see me as Pontins
Its hard to believe that buff girls like me
But its a cold/coal world and girls like heat
And the reason I don't get gassed?
Petrol companies can't shell like me

This is way too hard for them
We make it hard for them
They build it up, we shut it down
We're making niggas start again
This is way too hard for them
We make it hard for them
They build it up, we shut shit down
We're making niggas start again
