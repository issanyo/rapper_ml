(Beam me up Scotty)

[Verse]
Whippin' excursion
Oh shit, I've gotta pick up that person
In the trap house, whipping that work and
You're not a gangster, you're just an internet version
Whippin' that wurzel
You know me, I've got the littlest circle
Mrs in the crib, you know I'm keeping that fertile
We don't take pictures, you know I'm keeping that personal
White so clean, you know I'm flipping that Persil
Soon be the million dollar man, like I'm living with Virgil
Real shit, this ain't a little rehearsal
Big gun like Rick, it's like I'm living with Hershel
Gangster, gangster
I'm with Lisa and Jackie, grab Samantha
Little bit of Drake and brang that Sampha
I'm the darkest, rap Black Panther
Man don't powder, and I doubt man pamper
Man are real badman, unnu dat man stand for
I'm in an HSB, I went and bucked one banker
A lot of man play Ken, but man ah badman Blanka
Grab it and swerve it, turn it, grab it and burn it
Banging that Kermit, you gotta grab it and firm it
Banging that German whip, slanging that Sherman
If man has to burn then fuck it, I'm grabbing that burner
I just linked up with Buck and I'm with Alex in Berlin
Gravity surfing, cavities hurting
Man of no mercy, man have been murking
Man are just actors, man are rehearsing
And man was all talking
Now man are reverting
And now man are converting
