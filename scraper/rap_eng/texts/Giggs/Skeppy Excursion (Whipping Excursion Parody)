(Beam me up Scotty)

[Verse]
Chicken is burning
Got a sort, she can cook, 'til I bucked it in person
In the DM, she had me putting that work in
You're not a wifey, you're just an Instagram version
Now I'm eating that Colonel
Two piece and a pack of that herbal
I used to stunt in pics, then I nearly got burgled
Now all of my pictures are a little bit personal
White socks pon' feet, you know I mess with that Persil
Dude with the million dollar plans, even though my money's quite hurtful
Real spit, I was out of my circle
Post on the strip, we was looking for Squirtles
That's not banter
This eediat put ice in my Fanta
Threw it in his face, cah' man can't have that
This girl said we're mates, just 'cause man's clapped
Man don't powder, dark like Ghana
One youth slapped my boy, I said "you shouldn't have that"
Then he looked at me and said "you should've backed man"
So I looked at him like "he's hench, are you mad fam?"
Grab it and turn it, curl it
Stand like you're fearless
Hitting like Skepta did, until you're hot like a furnace
Driving that German whip, banging Ed Sheeran
Her pits were sweating buckets, nose started burning
I just picked up my plug, now we asking for sterling
Trapping ain't working, honeys keep curving
Man are so merky, cop clothes like we're earning
But I keep all the tags on, so we can return 'em

[Outro]
Ayo Giggs
Remix my tune again and then bring it out before my tune comes out, yeah?
They'll be problems innit'
Not "Whippin' Excursion" it's "Chicken is Burning", rudeboy
Yeah? Ay' no, I'm joking, I'm joking
Don't come after me
