[Verse 1: Giggs]
Thinking of the same old thoughts
Out here pitching with the same old fork
And the fire's still burning
Flames still flicker from the same old torch
The amount of cocaine I bought
Is the amount of cocaine they snort
We call it a game but it ain't no sport for my mandem
Pain still slivers from my brain and taunts
And I'm starting to feel low
'Cause I miss Tiny, Carlton and Jim Jones
Or TB beside me, but I still get joke
After Tiny, Carlton or Jim phones
And it feels odd, and I feel lost
'Cause they took away my niggas fam I feel robbed
And I know they must feel lodged
But when I pray for my niggas I feel God
With the heart and the right mind
Run through the day and pass through the night time
Graft at the right time, master the white line
Pass me the yac, fuck a glass of the white whine
Let me soothe my sins
Fuck feds I ain't looking to view the bin
Three man left and they're looking to move us in
The weather outside's equivalent to the mood I'm in

[Chorus: Alana Faye] (x2)
This life is bringing me down
When will things turn around
Can't keep sitting down
Always on the rebound

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Thinking that the game's so messed
Pissed off thinking 'bout my young buck Jess
And I'm tired of vermin
Pigs and rats got my young pups stressed
And I'm starting to feel sad
'Cause I miss Marcus, pissed 'cause I miss nan
Lee was the big man when I was a yout man
Fam, you see that nigga there, he's a missed man
I ain't living the worst, but I ain't rich
Low p's got me feeling like I ain't shit
I don't mean to be making cocaine trips
Forgive me God I'm sinning for my wages
And I think I really outta get out
I ain't sorted shit out
By now shoulda bought her a house
My hardworking mum's who I'm talking about
And my son's future, I'm sorting it now
You think my music woulda brought in the pounds
It's a bit greazy, so what? I ain't watering down
So they got me on the road, with a quarter of brown
Making bare deliveries from the morning 'till now
Stressed and depressed
Spend more time with my yout' then I eat less
And I'm tired and I need rest
Deep sigh then a deep breath

[Chorus: Alana Faye] (x2)
This life is bringing me down
When will things turn around
Can't keep sitting down
Always on the rebound

[Bridge: Alana Faye]
I look around on the streets and I see
Little  boys and girls who are young than me
Rolling greazy, rolling deep
Trying to make money, trying to make ends meet
But this ain't the way it should be
Killing one another over money, over p's
And I know the streets can be mean
You wouldn't believe all the things I've seen

[Chorus: Alana Faye] (x4)
This life is bringing me down
When will things turn around
Can't keep sitting down
Always on the rebound
