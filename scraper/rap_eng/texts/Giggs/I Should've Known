[Verse 1]
I kicked this bitch to the curb
Now she's ringing off my phone about she wants to talk
But it ain't worth it girl I gave it lots of thought
You don't give a shit about me
You just care about the rock I bought
And what's in my pocket and my boxer shorts
The first time we met, in a rave, babygirl I shoulda clocked your sort
You found your way to me soon as I popped the cork
But the way you moved your body round, in that skirt, was impossible
I'm thinking to myself this might be lockable
You came over and gave me a hug
Your facial expression said that we should get the fuck out the club
Head to my place and cut up the buds, take a couple of puffs
Wile out and start to fuck on the rug
Looking back I was a bit of a mug
But you picked up on my loneliness and saw I was a sucker for love
I even thought about you having my son
But the only thing you cared about was telling friends you're fucking a thug

[Chorus] x2
(Famalam) I shoulda known nigga
I lusted this hoe's figure
Went and trusted a gold digger
I shoulda known nigga
After all I'm a road nigga
Hard work, that's how it goes niggas

[Verse 2]
Now ima get on with the rest of my life
Much happier now I've got that pest out my life
No more stress on my mind
And I think I've found the real thing now
I've got new princess as my wife
And she loves a mobster for his mind
She hollers at a nigga when I'm out there on the grind
She understood me billin up my line
Even though she had to sacrifice getting a minute of my time
And she never stresses me or lies
Not like these other jezebels obsessing over shine
I'm thinking 'bout you right now as I rhyme
Taking all your clothes off and get your sexy body next to mine
Work your body right, and right now's the perfect time of night
Bareback I wanna circulate a child
And right now I'm working with the vibe
But don't get it twisted, the next round is terminator time

[Chorus] x2
(Famalam) I shoulda known nigga
I lusted this hoe's figure
Went and trusted a gold digger
I shoulda known nigga
After all I'm a road nigga
Hard work, that's how it goes niggas
