[Verse 1: Giggs]
Rolling in a car couple man
Hit BP and put half in the talk
Got about a half in my pants
Hitting up a party with hoes that's part of the plan
Buck's in the party and bang
Hoes wanna dance with with my camp
Pass me a glass and a champs
And niggas know me
I be on a G'd up ting so don't ask me to skank
The rest of the party's a blank
The last thing I recall is sparking the dank
And trust me it stank
Spen said the hoes are on his dick
And Buck was alone with a chick
And I was alone, drunk, dancing and sparking a spliff
Laughing and acting a prick
And Joe got a dancer to strip
And Trig took a blast of my spliff
And it rassclart knocked him for 6
You know it ain't hard to depart with a bitch
'Cause half of the chicks here ask me for sniff

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)
Strap a little spliff, have a couple drinks
Have a bit of fun, slap a couple bums
When up in the shoobz
We don't wanna fight, we just want some love
Smoke a little bud, get a little love
Just shaking a foot

[Verse 2: Buck]
Buck Boy I'm in the club
Mash there, big slugs
Polo shirt, fresh cuz
Iced out, Jesus
Fresh to death yeah I look sick
Any beef, fam nah I'm rolling with a loose clique
Don't want a wife so I'm looking for a loose chick
Fam put that chain away 'cause fam you can lose it
Price not a problem 'cause we've got the dough
And I'm with Foss and Joubby, looking for the hoes
G-ratings like when I get nicked, nah I don't snitch
Got a little suttin like "rah she a good ting"
Dress code right bruv her neck and her hair's bling
Game so tight, won't spend a penny not on one thing
Yeah with shanks and toys
I'm with my Wooly Road famalam and Pecknarm Boys
And together we've got it locked trust
See bare chicks in one corner there with us

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)
Strap a little spliff, have a couple drinks
Have a bit of fun, slap a couple bums
When up in the shoobz
We don't wanna fight, we just want some love
Smoke a little bud, get a little love
Just shaking a foot

[Verse 3: Kyze]
What's a dance without Kyze
I just wanna get with the dancers inside
Plus the army's inside
Looking at funny niggas just chancing their eyes
Chicks look at me with a spark in their eyes
Wanna take her home, but I can't 'cause of my wife
Fuck that shit, I'll just park it at Grind's
Don't need a long nob to be lasting all night
Then I'm right back outside
With all of my niggas so right now I'm hyped
Niggas mean mug but they don't want no fights
This is our strip and they know what we're like
I don't know your clique but I know you know mine
You bitch niggas ain't got a place in my mind
Niggas act up and I'm taking their shine
I'm hungry, I've got a taste for this crime

[Chorus: Giggs] (x2)
Strap a little spliff, have a couple drinks
Have a bit of fun, slap a couple bums
When up in the shoobz
We don't wanna fight, we just want some love
Smoke a little bud, get a little love
Just shaking a foot
