[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
Tell em that I run shit
Baby, show your good side, send a boy a titty and a bum pic
Splitting all the crumbs with my mum's kids
Promised I'mma get 'em outta Plumstead
You a sucker nigga, what?
Blowing hella trees with the squad
You can't buy the steeze in the shop
Pagans don't believe in a God 'til it's judgement
I'm way up looking like I'm on a substance
I'll be like whoo!

[Verse 1: Giggs]
She just look at me
I can make that pussy get emotional
They just look at me
Cause they know that nigga really local
Vocal, nigga really vocal
She wanna sniff and get a nose full
I wanna hit 'em with that hard shit
I wanna strip a little Pro Tool
Phone call, got a little phone call
Yeah nigga, got a little phone call
Say that she been waiting up for hours
And if you don't get your pussy, it's your own fault
Own fault, nigga, that's a hoe sport
Yeah, little nigga, that's a hoe's thoughts
Man ain't playing no games here
Niggas ain't on no talk
Let me try and calculate it
Better get the calculators
Scales in a plastic bag
Nigga, that's the apparatus
Nigga think he calculated
Nigga bout to matinee it
Black boys, make you think they [?]

[Hook: Giggs]
Look at me
Nigga just look at me, look at me
Picture me
You could see the crookedest crook in me
Just got this zoot on me
In the kitchen and I'm cooking up crookedly
Niggas talking bout ghost
Wait, did a nigga just whoopi me?

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I'm dark-skinned and she light brown
She wanna do it with the lights down
I tell her strip, I tell her lie down
I said this shit will never die down
Hustle on the street to get the right pound
I just called your chick an Uber, make her fly down
Niggas try to test a nigga if a nigga changed
Overfinch black, call this shit a nigga range
Hope you niggas entertained
Tell 'em bout my first and my second name
Tell 'em bout my world record, set the record straight
In the car bumping Ma$e and some pepper spray
No days off, even on my wedding day
For that spot, dog, I even seen a leopard change
I'mma let you have it when I'm done with it
And it's gonna be a never, mate
Tell 'em that a legend never dies, legends never age
I was in the club, you was still drinking lemonade
I was in doing studio when it never paid
I was out buying Yeezys, they were selling yay
Now look at me
I bet you can't even look at me
Go on, gwan with your boopery
Ayo rudeboy, pass me the hookah, please

[Hook: Giggs]
Look at me
Nigga just look at me, look at me
Picture me
You could see the crookedest crook in me
Just got this zoot on me
In the kitchen and I'm cooking up crookedly
Niggas talking bout ghost
Wait, did a nigga just whoopi me?
