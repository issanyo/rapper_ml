[Intro: Kyra + (Giggs)]
If your irritated I can relate, Yeahhhh
No, No, No
(I know we argue, but girl the loves still there)

[Verse 1: Giggs]
You know the loves real here, You keep it natural baby, I love real hair
You ask if I'm a thug, well yeah
I'm coming from the 'Narm   Am I a thug?
Hell yeah (course)
I told her it's been fucked all year, I can't believe I saw my Nigga's blood spilled there (for real)
She said that we should up, leave here
I said babe, I don't give a fuck who's scared
She's moaning again
And I can't believe were going through this moment again
I done walked out the door got my coat and I went
This ain't a millionaire show but she's phoning a friend
She's emotional, crying saying shes hopeless with men
You should get rid of him and we'll get poaching again
But shes unsociable
No-one wants to know her again
Her friends washed up, I think that bitch is smoking again

[Chorus: Kyra]
If your irritated, I can relate, Yeahh
Boy I don't wanna go but I don't wanna stay
You got my mind on overload and now I really wish that we could find a way
So many times I've walked this road
It'd be better for me but I;m addicted to the way you are and now it can't be so I've gotta get myself off
If you can't handle the heat when your'e talking to me. One out, game on
I'm not gonna make you believe, that I'm cool when you leave
One out, game on
Cause I'm not the kinda girl who's gonna sit around
And wait up fucking laying here just playing house
I will just let you know oo ohhh
One out, Game on

[Verse 2: Giggs]
You know the loves real here
I know we argue but girl the loves still there
Sometimes I think fuck this here (fuck it)
But I ain't going nowhere babe, I'ma still care
This ain't a lustful affair when we get it on baby I'ma touch you there
You know those sluts still stare
Your rolling with Hollowman you must feel rare
She's getting me vex
Says I'm always on road but It's getting me cheques
These women always gonna moan and It's getting me stressed
Am I a bad boyfriend? and she's telling me yes (what)
But everythings different when we get into bed
When I get it out baby I'ma get in your legs
Imma rip you to shreds, you'l be wetting the bed
Got the pussy lock down call it firmingly sex
[Chorus: Kyra]
If your irritated, I can relate, Yeahh
Boy I don't wanna go but I don't wanna stay
You got my mind on overload and now I really wish that we could find a way
So many times I've walked this road
It'd be better for me but I;m addicted to the way you are and now it can't be so I've gotta get myself off
If you can't handle the heat when your'e talking to me. One out, game on
I'm not gonna make you believe, that I'm cool when you leave
One out, game on
Cause I'm not the kinda girl who's gonna sit around
And wait up fucking laying here just playing house
I will just let you know oo ohhh
One out, Game on
