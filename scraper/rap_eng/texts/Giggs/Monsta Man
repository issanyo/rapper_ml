[Verse 1]
I heard that she wanted me
Well tell me what she wants from me
They're telling me she's on to me
She wants a little john from me
She ain't gonna make it long for me
Squeeze it, gonna make it honk for me
She's gonna get it constantly
This chick's gonna meet the monster me
She's gonna get the monsta
Chocolate, yeah, she's gonna get the Wonka
Tell me if you want it stronger
Babe I know that you really want to
Smash, she's gonna get the conker
Splash, she's gonna get the lobster
She's gonna get the mobster
I think I'll put her on the roster

[Hook]
Mon-Monster
Gon-Gonna get the monster
Mon-Monster
Gon-Gonna get the monster

[Verse 2]
Showtime, they're telling me she's onto man
She's heard about the monster bang
She's calling me the monster man
I can see that's what she wants from man
She wants a man
Who wants her fam
Who wants to holler at the monster man
Well that's not the plan
So she ain't going to get any response from man
That's long for man
She wants to get me nicked 'cos
Just because of what my dick does
Everywhere I go I'm getting chicks love
Even when I'm chilling in the strip club
This the way I'm living I'm a sick thug
Legit buss

Giggs: Ey no more cut that out!
