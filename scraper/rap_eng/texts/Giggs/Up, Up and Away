[Verse 1 : Giggs]

Rolling on the motorway
Mad paranoid with a bulk of yay
They say that my music's all negative
But that's all I see so what the fuck am I supposed to say
Trapped in the game with a pokerface
Hence the word trap
So what the fuck am I supposed to play
If the feds trap my movements
And they scope the play
Then that's my weeks wages getting thrown away
Yeah, it's major, going down the drain
Rolling with my nigga Tiny Boost, that's my protege
Fuck it, let me roll a jay
Get the cig and rizla, let me smoke away
I'm a hood nigga that was broke in ways
Words can't explain, I changed up
Now I broke the chain
Spit that broken pain
Get that shit lighted up and let's get smoking mane

[Chorus : J. Melo & Giggs]

I'm toking hard on this good shit
So you better know
I inhale then exhale
(Up, Up and Away)
[?] I'm flying in
It's getting low
Feels like I'm floating
(Up, Up and Away)
Getting high
Flying high
(Up, Up and Away)
Getting high
Flying high
(Up, Up and Away)

[Verse 2 : Giggs]

Zone out, get a zoobie rolled
Gotta link Georgie low key on Wooly Road
Told me he's got the drop on them pussy holes
Linked him at unit where the bullies go
He rolled up but he pulled in slow
Banging Who Said That? with his windows low
Screaming "You F'd that, fam your movements known"
Jumped out dressed black and he's [?] stone
Island, I got them swishas rolled
Little tropical juice which is mixed with 'trone
Them motherfuckers got boost
Cause their pisty's blown
So I'm blowing on these zoots
To get the scriptures scrolled
They say when I rap I got that lifting soul
An artist, they say my picture's cold
And I'm the hardest and it's flippin' known
I'm a smash the market and get that piss take dough

[Chorus : J. Melo & Giggs]

I'm toking hard on this good shit
So you better know
I inhale then exhale
(Up, Up and Away)
[?] I'm flying in
It's getting low
Feels like I'm floating
(Up, Up and Away)
Getting high
Flying high
(Up, Up and Away)
Getting high
Flying high
(Up, Up and Away)
