[Chorus: Dubz + Giggs]
What's Ard Bodied
Tell you what's Ard Bodied
Who just done?
Alright, cah I pop it
That's Ard Bodied
Find out where you are probably
Then I get the large shotty
Leave him in the car slumped

[Verse 1: Dubz]
Don't ramp with us, we tote hammers
Blood I'm not Santana but I shoot like cameras
And plus I spit like a camel does
You just dribble, it's a bib what I'm handing ya
Yeah, you might be a physical man
But I'm a little motherfucking tarantula
So you better run 'til your ankle bruck
Click-click, buck at an angle cah
The kickback might fuck up the handler
The stick clap I fucking dismantle ya
Six pack well you're fucking with amateurs
I'm fucking with bosses
CEO's, OG's and managers
Oh please, I'll damage ya
Have your whole crew say "there's no need for badness"
I know G's that hold ki's just like janitors
I get O'z off no teeth and Gareth
'Cause I know fiends that know fiends
That's told fiends it's banging
Hat low, jeans are hanging
Crack dough feeds my family
Act slow, meet my gang
Gats blow, squeeze your fam
We'll be shooting

[Chorus: Dubz + Giggs]
What's Ard Bodied
Tell you what's Ard Bodied
Who just done?
Alright, cah I pop it
That's Ard Bodied
Find out where you are probably
Then I get the large shotty
Leave him in the car slumped

[Verse 2: Blade Brown]
Stop talking greazy you're a damn liar
Push my buttons and you're gonna hear this man fire
And if I bang, I (clap)
I'm aiming for that neck like a vampire
I'm a gram seller, you're a gram buyer
A kidnapper, duct-taper, hand tier
And trust me that's not a lie
And I'm getting watched by a lot of guys
Probably cah my rocks get a lot of buys
And my watch is a proper size
(What is it?) It ain't no Aqua
Really on the roads darg, I ain't no actor
And yeah I always get the right piff
Flake's like that Omagh hit, there's nothing like this
Standing on the block with the heavy kettle
Surrounded by rock heads and heavy metal
And I ain't talking 'bout Metallica
Young gunner's shank's bout the size of Excalibur's
Shottas wanna ride with this manager
Load up the machine then we ride on our challengers
And fuck rolling with 35 niggas
The three that I roll with are certified killers

[Chorus: Dubz + Giggs]
What's Ard Bodied
Tell you what's Ard Bodied
Who just done?
Alright, cah I pop it
That's Ard Bodied
Find out where you are probably
Then I get the large shotty
Leave him in the car slumped
