[Hook: Lotto Savage]
I just copped a Lam and a Rover
I just flooded my wrist with diamonds and gold
I just hit the kids and dropped a deuce
I just dropped a Percocet and Xan in my juice
I’m back on that trap shit, back on that trap shit
Back on that trap shit, I’m back on that trap shit
I’m back on that trap shit, back on that trap shit
Back on that trap shit, I’m back on that trap shit

[Verse 1: Lotto Savage]
Don slaughter
Yeah, yeah, back on that trap shit
Meet me when I rap shit
Fuck around and get clapped bitch
Yeah, ha ha, the trap house boomin’
J’s knocking at the door lookin’ for the blow
Yeah we got it boomin’
We taking them packs and we bustin’ them down
In the hood I’m the one with the pounds
Got weed, got molly, got soft, got hard
Got Percocet, lower [?], xans, and the bars
The trapper of the year, I won me a trophy
I got on four rings and I feel like I’m Kobe
Skrt, skrt, skrt skrt skrt skrt
I whip my shit up and it jump out the bowl
Use the eggbeater just to whip up the bowl
Don’t play ‘bout my money don’t play ‘bout my kids
We serve out the back, know we keep them extensions
We trappin’, tryna turn a crumb to a milly
We trap in the day and we trap in the night
We trappin’ just to make a motherfuckin’ living
We copped [?] that rollie flooded with ice
