Hahaha, oh I like this one London
This one go hard, I'm finna fuck this one up
Nah I'ma fuck this up like

[Hook]
Remember I just blew my first mil (blew it)
Rollie gold, put that furniture inside my crib (the newest)
Pour a whole full pint in that eight liter (drank)
With my teacher, I was flexing hard, go at Keisha (Keisha)
Still thinking about that bankroll I just lost (whew)
Shooting dice at the loft with my Uncle Knot (uh)
Pissed off, I can't make a number or a shot (fuck)
Fuck it, I ain't shoot no more, I'm bout to hit the block
Hit the block late, hit the block

[Verse 1]
Dime a dozen
Ride with me, you will get a lot of it (you will)
Pride of my son, he'll ride with me junior
Size 'em up, got to show 'em who the biggest (who-who)
Shot the perp coming on my fucking pivot
Straight 8 truck used to drive a Civic (skrt)
Want a whole 8 ball? Give me a minute (hold on wait)
You gon' fall face first, it's all in your feelings (bitch)
Got my first baby when I was 14 (Quay)
I know this sound crazy but I don't drink
I told my lady to satisfy me
Cause baby you gon' fuck around and lose me (I'm telling you)

[Hook]
Remember I just blew my first mil (what)
Rollie gold, put that furniture inside my crib (hey)
Pour a whole full pint in that eight liter
With my teacher, I was flexing hard, go at Keisha
Still thinking about that bankroll I just lost
Shooting dice at the loft with my Uncle Knot
Pissed off, I can't make a number or a shot
Fuck it, I ain't shoot no more, I'm bout to hit the block
Hit the block late, hit the block

[Verse 2]
Ain't got common sense (no)
You know I ride with them niggas that will die for me (know that)
Homicide if you fucking with my benefits (go on top)
But you tried if you thinking I'm not with the shits (you gon drop)
No pot, I used shit and piss on the concrete bricks
.45 tucked on the side of me just in case she bitch
Multiplied if you thought Dae Dae would be crease (the fuck?)
Wonder why R&B, yeah I'm listening to Lucci (Lucci)
And my motherfucking feelings (God damn)
Over there in them trenches, yeah

[Hook]
Remember I just blew my first mil (damn)
Rollie gold, put that furniture inside my crib (sheesh)
Pour a whole full pint in that eight liter (how the hell?)
With my teacher, I was flexing hard, go at Keisha
Still thinking about that bankroll I just lost (turn up)
Shooting dice at the loft with my Uncle Knot (yeah)
Pissed off, I can't make a number or a shot (yeah)
Fuck it, I ain't shoot no more, I'm bout to hit the block
Hit the block late, hit the block

[Outro]
Hit the block late, hit the block, yeah
Hit the block late, hit the block, yeah
Hit the block late, hit the block, yeah
Hit the block late, hit the block
