[Verse 1]
I just can't deal with that basic shit
I just can't deal with that hating shit
Giuseppe shoes, no laces bitch
My shoes got zippers, I need a zip
I'm a real hustler, at Tip
Hop out the Chevy and let it rip
Car on 30s, it need a lift
VVS chain a chandelier
Outdoors smoking indo
Real Lambo tinted ho
I remember playing Nintendo
Now I'm flexin' hard, PS4
Give me two bands for a feature
Don't play on the beat cause boy I eat ya
I'm real street, I don't fuck with leeches
My Rolex shining hard from the bleachers
Love Life on my snapback
I'm just tryna bring rap back
Twenty thousand in my backpack
Hit the Voo and get a lap dance
I am not arrogant, no
I'm still humble even when broke
Playmaker, back in [?]
We comin' hard and we need a check
