[Intro]
Nigga the other day
Told him we gon' be on
Told him we gon' be on, we gon' be straight
(I see 'em pocket watching, I see 'em)
I just talked to my nigga the other day
I just talked to my nigga the other day
(Another day for the kid don't it)
I just talked to my nigga the other day
I just talked to my nigga the other day
You ain't never gonna catch him

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
I just talk to my nigga the other day
Told him we gon' be on
Told him we gon' be on, we gon' be straight
Say that money exposin' niggas
Show the real and show the fake
Gotta keep it on you nigga, you tryna see another day
I know you watchin', I know you plottin'
Know you worried about my pockets
These hoes say you pillow talkin'
They say you hatin' cause I'm poppin'
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah I rap, I'm still poppin'
You lil niggas made the news, better stop the pocket watchin'

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
When I was trappin' hard you lil niggas was scared to tote hammers
Run my money up, pulled up in the jungle with bananas
Twenty killers, twenty sticks, bet that nigga gon' shit
And we hittin' all our targets we ain't comin' to miss
Take you back to old 6, me and boy in the cut
He got the shotty, I got the Glock we ready to tear some shit up
Let's take it back to city life, I put the car in the park
Police findin' all these pills but bro said I got the charge
We just some cool young niggas but don't play with it
You try some slick shit and think you gon' get away with it
You got a handle that is not, you in the wrong business
I'm on that gangster shit, he said fuck a witness
(Pull up on you)

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
I just talk to my nigga the other day
Told him we gon' be on

[Verse 2: Ca$h Out]
Pull up and I'm flexin' so hard that you know I'm gettin' money
Nigga asked me what I want up out the game, I want the money
God watchin' over me, I'm stayin' down I know it's comin'
This chopper for protection, no layin' down, you know I'm drummin'
Lord knows, Lord knows, I had to stay in the cold
That's why I'm rockin' this coat and everything is so froze
I gotta stay below zero when I'm fuckin' your ho
I got to stick to the G code when I'm in that beast mode
I say it's switchin' up the flow, yeah you gotta decode
I wipe my ass with the 20s, I use 100s for my nose
Granny said it's just paper nigga go get some gold
You waste your life bein' a hater, nigga get you some goals

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
I just talk to my nigga the other day
Told him we gon' be on

[Verse 3: Dae Dae]
That was 6 years ago, I ain't know that about no go
I just pulled up at your spot, I just turned up at the show
I need 10 for a show, I'm not takin' nothin' less
That's my goal, take care of my kids
You need to go on cause you the wiz
Heart feel so cold, it's so cold man
I just pulled out my cars out in traffic
Look please don't call my phone if you ain't bad bitch
Yeah feel so good I just talked to my brother
