[Chorus]
Keep my bae with me
You gon stay with me
You ain't gon lay on me
She gon lay with me
[Let's go]

Yea them blue cheese
Look how I ride around
Gettin' blown by the pound
My bitch love that sound
My bitch thicked up yea
My bitch in the trap
Bitch that 50 rounds
(Keep by bae with me)

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
I'm killing shit and shit is nothing to me
Drop top coupe

Oo, why you too cool
Cool taught me the recipe
Dude caught the flu

But if I hurt you
What if I laughed  at you
Yea would you laugh too
Watch me get bags baby

Always come with bad news
Never bring my past up
