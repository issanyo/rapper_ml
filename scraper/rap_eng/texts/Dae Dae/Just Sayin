[Chorus]
Fuck her when I wanna, turn up when I wanna
Laugh in the corner, smokin' marijuana
Tear up comma, three stacks, day I got it
Killed 'em with them bales on, I got cajun Gotti
Packs on me, showin' love to me, I ain't trippin' 'bout it
Imagine, if you fuck me, better tell nobody
'Cause back then I was nothin', now I'm really poppin'
And the facts in, them other niggas flex and they ain't really got it

[Verse 1]
Cap they neck
Why he keep that Calico? 'Cause niggas hatin' on the low
Nigga please, I'm different breed, white tee, I'm still street
Bite, if you TMZ, hi, D-A-E-D-A-E
Night, she gon' ride with me, enlight with love life, homie
Voodoo type make you thick, baby
Don't be shy when you're around me
I got hundreds, I got rapper weed
I got shooters, they gon' ride for me
Couple poodles for my bitch and mama
I can't lose, I know what they on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep the taillights every day
Me, I get high every day
Can't believe I'm alive, I'm okay
Play with me, you gon' die, we don't play
I'm just sayin' though

[Chorus]
Fuck her when I wanna, turn up when I wanna
Laugh in the corner, smokin' marijuana
Tear up comma, three stacks, day I got it
Killed 'em with them bales on, I got cajun Gotti
Packs on me, showin' love to me, I ain't trippin' 'bout it
Imagine, if you fuck me, better tell nobody
'Cause back then I was nothin', now I'm really poppin'
And the facts in, them other niggas flex and they ain't really got it

[Verse 2]
What? Pack came in
Money counter, brrrt, beep
Nigga count up, he
Scrape the pot, extra cheese, off the lot, you know me
Off the top, Eazy E, I fuck with opps, they cool with me
Blue locks, they know it's me, blue dooly with the dark tints
Blue [?] with the extended [?]
Blue strips stuffed in these [?]
Bad bitch, you know she Crippin'
Bad bitch, come ride with me
Bad bitch is down with it
Facts, I ain't got time for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep the taillights every day
Me, I get high every day
Can't believe I'm alive, I'm okay
Play with me, you gon' die, we don't play
I'm just sayin' though

[Chorus]
Fuck her when I wanna, turn up when I wanna
Laugh in the corner, smokin' marijuana
Tear up comma, three stacks, day I got it
Killed 'em with them bales on, I got cajun Gotti
Packs on me, showin' love to me, I ain't trippin' 'bout it
Imagine, if you fuck me, better tell nobody
'Cause back then I was nothin', now I'm really poppin'
And the facts in, them other niggas flex and they ain't really got it
