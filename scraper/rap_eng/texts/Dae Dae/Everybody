[Intro]
That boy Cassius

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' get it if they print it
They've been printin' for a minute, them lil' niggas just won't get it, yeah
Everybody pop out on that pistol with them Benjis out
Pulled up on a kid and found out he wasn't really gettin' it, yeah
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' go and cop that Bentley
How you gon' cop that Bentley if you ain't out here tryna get it in?
Everybody postin' pictures with they bitches
All in they feelings, but when they break up, have they ass be lookin' silly, ayy

[Verse 1: Paper Lovee]
Have they ass be lookin' silly, 'cause they out here chasin' bitches
I'm chasin' Benjis, I'm tryna ball like Diddy
Told my nigga, "If you with me and you go against me
I'ma have to kill you," and he know that I wasn't kiddin', yeah
My nigga know I wasn't playin', yeah
My nigga know what I'm sayin', yeah
I'm just Saint Lawrence's finest bro
All that shit come off the hand
And I'm still thinkin' I'm the man
'Cause if I'm the man, you the man, we the man
And I throw with the Bloods so I beat a man
I know my little nigga tough 'cause we beat him in
Everybody talkin' 'bout how they got this and that
I got Gucci, I got Louis, I mix and match
Hit the mall, I want it all, I'ma spend some racks
I miss my brother, boy please bring Lil Richard back
You see that 'Rari outside? I fucked your bitch in that
Got a brand new spot, and my bathroom and my kitchenette
I lost my ho and fucked 'round, got all my bitches back
I bucked and I [?], these niggas are not fixin' that

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' get it if they print it
They've been printin' for a minute, them lil' niggas just won't get it, yeah
Everybody pop out on that pistol with them Benjis out
Pulled up on a kid and found out he wasn't really gettin' it, yeah
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' go and cop that Bentley
How you gon' cop that Bentley if you ain't out here tryna get it in?
Everybody postin' pictures with they bitches
All in they feelings, but when they break up, have they ass be lookin' silly, ayy

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Everybody talkin' how they heavy hunters
How they stuntin', boy you cap, you know you on it, boy you silly
I got pointers on my rings, I got punters that gon' squeeze
I got Robins on my jeans, a nigga drippin'
I got cars with no keys, I got broads waitin' on me
I got God, he with me, I got choppers in that Jeep
I got Cashset with me, lot of cash that's on me
Lot of bag that's on me, ain't no playin', time to eat
And it's still run your racks up
And I'm still in that black truck, yeah (turn up)
And it's still fuck your set boy
And you still bring my ears up

[Chorus: Paper Lovee]
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' get it if they print it
They've been printin' for a minute, them lil' niggas just won't get it, yeah
Everybody pop out on that pistol with them Benjis out
Pulled up on a kid and found out he wasn't really gettin' it, yeah
Everybody talkin' 'bout they gon' go and cop that Bentley
How you gon' cop that Bentley if you ain't out here tryna get it in?
Everybody postin' pictures with they bitches
All in they feelings, but when they break up, have they ass be lookin' silly, ayy
