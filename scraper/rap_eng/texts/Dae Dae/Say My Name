[Refrain: Young Thug]
Hold on, hold on, big ol' racks
Rat-a-tat-tat, whack
Lay my hat in your house on your rack
Like what, what, slatt, woo-woo

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
New Moncler, baby take my jacket
Yeah, straight from the bottom of the slaves and the wolves
I done came from the bottom of the ken', got rich
They schemed with a MAC 10
That nigga back, but they shot ten
By the time a pop a bean, they rotten
Niggas know air, what you want?
Commas'll bring you where you want, huh
Tryin' not to sin it, but it's hard
Projects, ask your girl what you want
Nigga, she will suck your dick in the car, yeah
Come in here, make her fiend, 'bout to make the J finger-fuck my rims
Little Red Ridin' Hood I was servin' that boy the same color Timbs
Rollies come plain and Pateks, yeah I keep that, bet a wrist on your neck
I'm in the kitchen I'm whippin', my bitch is sayin' "Get it," I look like I'm Belly
I took the top off the Range, then put Chanel on all of my mains
I looked her right in her eyes and told the bitch to say my name
Make her say

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Baby say my name
Make her say my name

[Refrain: Young Thug]
Hold on, hold on, big ol' racks
Rat-a-tat-tat, whack
Lay my hat in your house on your rack
Like what, what, slatt, woo-woo

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Bitch, I won't never change
Everybody 'round me gettin' money gang, gang
In the trap with them racks on me and all my chains (gang)
The phone tapped, bitch, I don't wanna talk to you no more
Nigga run it up (run it up, run it up, run it up)
Young nigga ride with the blue racks
Young nigga proud to do this (young nigga)
Fuck outside on due dates (woo)
My niggas gon' ride, go do that (niggas gon' ride)
My niggas gon' slide, gon' shoot that (niggas gon' slide)
You killin' my vibe don't do that (killin' my vibe)
Make her say me name
Ice out all my chain, yeah, pocket full of pain
We are not the same, fashion that's my lane
Mashin' in my lane, don't try it bitch he trained
I'm slidin' when it rain, she proud to say my name

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name
Make her say my name

Make her say my name, yeah, hold on

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I told [?] keep sellin' the baby doo
I told that nigga I'll turn his shirt straight to his skin and I'll fuck up his sweater too
I was just tellin' my ex when it come down to bitches I got me an avenue (woo)
I was just tellin' my ex when I catch her lil' boyfriend I'll fuck 'round and wack him too (hey)
I was just tellin' my ex I could fill up the room with her friends, I'm just tellin' you (yeah)
I was just tellin' my ex I could fill up the room with these hoes, it's an avenue
I was just tellin' my ex I could fill up the room, make it turn to an avenue
I was just thumbin' through checks and the big ol' blue hundreds on me look...

Red syrup sippin' motherfucker, ooh
Maserati forks when I eat, ooh
