[Verse 1 Plies]
I don't look at price tags, I just buy that shit (I just buy the shit)
I don't need nothing from none of you niggas so I don’t (politic)
Walk in the Gucci store they greet me by my government
The bank so much they started feeling like my residence
She ask me why I keep turnin' my head, bih, 'cus I don’t kiss
I gave a donation for the pussy 'cuh I don’t trick
I always wanna be 'da boss, neva' wanna be the shorter
The bosses always had the money to broke nigga was the shoot us
I ain't some Tom Brady and I ain’t Belichick
But I might have to buy another hand for all these rangs, bih
I came from from the bottom, nigga, that ain't no April fools (fools)
I'm blessed and I'm highly favored tell me how I'ma lose

[Chorus]
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke I gotta)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)

[Verse 3 Plies]
I'm always in the hood I'm just like Lil' Caesars
I'm on fire right now feel like a got a fever
Just left up out of Tootsie's and told myself I need Jesus
You know who's spread the most rumors, bitch, broke people
I ain't got too many muscles but my pockets Diesel
All these diamonds on me water bih Aquafina
Niggas ask me “Plies, how you make ya’ haters mad?”
I told him it's easy all you gotta do is get a bag
Used to ride Greyhound now I'm first-class
Use to scare rich people, now I don’t see ya ass
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Got my hands on ya' bih like I'ma doctor

[Chorus]
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke I gotta)
I gotta keep winning(blood smoke I gotta)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)

[Verse 3 Dae Dae]
No more losses (too many)
I took losses (that’s a no no)
Keep that carpet ‘cus I know that they plotters
I don't trust you, that Pleezy is my only friend (that’s my only friend)
But I love you the bitch she gave up on me yeah (gave up on me, yeah)
Girl, I'm tryna play no, what 'bout that time I lay low
Kush but with the gate closed
On the block with the yayo
Loon loss on the left wo
Took them lots to have me dead bro
It was hard but I stayed strong
I can't lose this I won't lose bitch
Long life with motherfucking movement
I'm so stupid we so foolish
We don't motherfucking losin’
I-I-I don't lost so many times

[Chorus]
I gotta keep winning (I gotta)
I gotta keep winning (I gotta)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke I gotta)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning (blood smoke)
I gotta keep winning, winning, winning (I done lost so many times)

I done lost so many times
