[Chorus: Dae Dae]
Tommyville my cousin, Four Season my cousin
Boulevard my cousins, Old Nat my cousin
Slauson Ave, Crenshaw
OG Bear, my big dog, yeah
Blue bandana tied 'round that dirty stick
My neighborhood gon' ride, know they with the shit
No don't be surprised when we pop up with it
All jokes to the side, you know who really get it

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
'68 old school Cutlass, baby blue
Rock your mind, that's what Dae Dae do, sheesh
Stack your paper, that's what my daddy taught me
Fuck them haters, that's what my mama taught me
These are real diamonds, they're called VVS's
Lil tombstone, RIP Kenny, yeah
[?] gone, he was the way left (we love you King)
RIP Troupe, I hope you listening
This that two figure one thumb talk
This that insane, shout out insane
Crease 'em up (what we doin'?)
Throw that shit up (what we doin'?)
Who you with (who you with?)
Who your cousins?
