[Chorus]
New blue Bugatti, I want it, I got it, I can
Feel like the man with that new Dae Dae chain
These niggas playin' like I won't top they mans
Jump out that Range and I jump in that Lam
They say lil Dae Dae broke, bitch I'll be damned
Nigga you know how I fuck up the city
Fuck up that check how I spend it, I spend it

[Verse 1]
Bae would you ride, would you slide with me
Why would lie, bae don't lie to me
I copped a condo for you and me
I just want you to spend time with me
I'm in the jungle with lions and creeps
RIP Mando, that's Lil Bird's partner
I'm in the 'Ville, free Lil Woody
I smoke out the crib with King Louie
This shit get real how my team do it
Fuck how they feel 'cause they can't do it
I might just trick 'em and then do 'em
I might just lick her and then do her
I know I'm trippin' on Yando
She love my drippin' on Yando
She know I'm crippin', who want smoke?
She know I'm rich, I ain't goin' for it
I fucked my bitch on the dashboard
The car got no keys so who asked for it
I'm not no police but I'm Bad Boys
I trap in the three, fuck the tag force

[Chorus]
New blue Bugatti, I want it, I got it, I can
Feel like the man with that new Dae Dae chain
These niggas playin' like I won't top they mans
Jump out that Range and I jump in that Lam
They say lil Dae Dae broke, bitch I'll be damned
Nigga you know how I fuck up the city
Fuck up that check how I spend it, I spend it
Hold up, new blue Bugatti, I want it, I got it, I can
Feel like the man with that new Dae Dae chain
These niggas playin' like I won't top they mans
Jump out that Range and I jump in that Lam
They say lil Dae Dae broke, bitch I'll be damned
Nigga you know how I fuck up the city
Fuck up that check how I spend it, I spend it

[Verse 2]
Extras on extras
These niggas stressin', I teach you a lesson like
Don't fall in love with no basic bitch
Go get some money and get rich
These niggas trippin', they not gettin' no money
They chase all these bitches like
Fuck is you doing man, fuck is you doing man
This shit gon' pay off
I promise my mama, I promise my lil ones
Long as they get it, I'm rapping and singing
Just long as I give it to 'em
My daddy, my daddy, he gettin' it, he trappin'
He love it, he love life
My brother, my brother, he say he been up
How the money don't feel right
Then right when I'm covered, might creep undercover and shoot at your mother
And she fucked my trust up, I don't trust no nigga
That shit took my daddy from me
I see you muggin', that shit don't mean nothin'
That glizzy is right here
I might said I love you, I know what I told you, but I ain't tryna take it there

[Chorus]
New blue Bugatti, I want it, I got it, I can
Feel like the man with that new Dae Dae chain
These niggas playin' like I won't top they mans
Jump out that Range and I jump in that Lam
They say lil Dae Dae broke, bitch I'll be damned
Nigga you know how I fuck up the city
Fuck up that check how I spend it, I spend it
Hold up, new blue Bugatti, I want it, I got it, I can
Feel like the man with that new Dae Dae chain
These niggas playin' like I won't top they mans
Jump out that Range and I jump in that Lam
They say lil Dae Dae broke, bitch I'll be damned
Nigga you know how I fuck up the city
Fuck up that check how I spend it, I spend it
