Verse:
Disappear from a lot of people's lives
Finna ghost side them with lies
Boutta hear the demons inside
My brain where it always rains
I think I am insane
They say go away my pain
Cope with sounds with a one dirty tempo
Bitch prayin for me couldn't be that simple
Chasing these dreams got me stuck in limbo
Sit right round sippin out the rendo
Smoking endo and I'm out there
Just wondering how it sounds
Love the soul decease
Skin caught toxic by the crease
That actually warms my heart
Feelin it is the start
People feel this aura
No one can do this like abora
Film the devil just like an outsider
Gotta get the Jared Leto

Chorus:
I don't wanna do this no more
To the red door
Gun to my jeans
Life ain't always what it seems
Till its nine
I hope I break your fucking heart
Hope you all feel remorse
For my mind filled with intercourse
I'm fucked up
I need drugs
I need love
I need a slug
Pistol

Now this the perfect intro
