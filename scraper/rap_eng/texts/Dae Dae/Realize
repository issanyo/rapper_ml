[Bridge]
Realize how far I came
Realize I haven't changed
Realize it's not revenge
Realize I've been goin' in
Realize I've been tourin', (shit)

Realize I put the time in
Realize I put the grind in
Realize it perfect timing
Realize these real diamonds

Realize I give the content
Realize right now I'm blunted
Realize I got the munchies
Realize I got the gun in, (shhh shhh shhh nigga trippin holmes)

[Hook]
Realize (3x)

[Verse 1]
Couple shooters, couple bitches, that's all I need
Where ya phone, don't take pictures baby, not round me
Couple partners down in prison, free Cap and Lil' D
Know some niggas stand the row that didn't say a thing
Know some niggas I grew up pose to went pro with me
Know some niggas I grew up wit didn't show no love to me
But it's still love homie
Realize, realize
But it's still love homie

[Hook]
Realize (2x)

[Verse 2]
No date, I'm droppin' this
No hate, no stoppin' him
Hard days I remember this
I moved far away from the bullshit
Watchin' cold cases, the first 48
Realize it gon take a couple shots to get away
Realize they gon hate and they gon plot anyway
Realize there was no cake and no presents under the tree
When I turned sixteen

[Hook]
Realize (3x)

(Stroud playin that mufucka boi, woo, I'm goin back in)

[Verse 3]
Dig around they gon play wit you
I'ma hawk you down like that Jamaican dude
They feel like I got screws missin'
Cause I'm too different
Ion mean to be rude, I can't do nothin wit you
Baby I'm so focused
Thinkin' bout my oldest
Want her to set her goals and go get it like you suppose to
Went and bought a goal she be workin' on her free throw
My momma bought her phone, you should see it, she think she too grown
You gotta let em see ya smile, you gotta let em see ya smile
You cannot let em see ya down
I gotta let em know I'm ridin'
I gotta let em know I'm gettin' it
I ain't wastin' no time

No time (2x)
