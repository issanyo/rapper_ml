[Hook]
Run Up if you want, Dae Dae guns you quick
Coward ass niggas, who you fuckin with?
Niggas know my M.O.,  boy I got that ammo
Run Up If you want I'll let it blow like Rambo
Its Jurassic Park, welcome to the streets
[?] make him feel the heat
Niggas know my M.O. boy I got that ammo
Run up if you want I'll let it blow like Rambo

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
I swear to god they effin' with the effin' one
Got that FN pointed at you better effin' run
If I see you in my city boy its over
For you
I'm suited up and shooting like a fucking soldier
I'm ready to go, load them up its hammer time
Im macking wit the mack hit him every time
Lay him down, bag him up
Take his ass away make sure you tag him up
Niggas talk that shit when they be crowded up
That chopper leave them quiet
But its loud as fuck
These niggas know we in the city 100 deep
Its Jurrasic Park,welcome to the streets

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Dae Dae]
I got shooters, I got niggas creepin at night like freddy
Krueger
Got them rugers with extendos and that bitch came like a tutor
Got them bitches hanging low them bitches like them titties from hooters
Blisters make you bleed, guarantee every shot go through you

(SQUAAAAADDD) It's Dae Dae Stallone, what the fuck you thinking?
2 shots to your dome leave you fucking stanking
Busting in the air where the fuck you aiming?
You niggas hate the squad and I don't fucking blame you

Bullets flippin out the drum, circus ride
Peel the skin off his head leave him circumcised
Like some little ass kids, you better run and hide
If not, it's gonna be a homicide

[Hook]
