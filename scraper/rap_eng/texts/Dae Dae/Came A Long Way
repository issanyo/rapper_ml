[Chorus]
Came a long way from that four six
Long way from that Four Reasons
Came a long way from the nicks and pots
Long way from them dirty blocks
Same shit, gotta change, this shit here get old
Same niggas act so hard when they around they folks
A lot of niggas up and left, I had to close that door
A lot of niggas needed my help and I was there for 'em

[Verse 1]
Tried to be patient, life is amazing
That ice looking crazy, I'm grinding for my babies
No more time tryna save me, almost died back in '03
Thank the god I ain't in these streets
Top back, smoking real HB
It seems like that's what they want me to be
Ain't no pressure what I want to be
Run that Tesla down Twenty East
I got my ladies right beside of me
I got my baby right beside of me
I know I'm crazy 'cause I'm opening
I'm a fitness, I'm like fuck it, fuck it
I told my mama that I'm buckin' (buckin')
Extra cheese on that omlette
Show them L's if you love me
Got Odell fuckin' with me
LeBron know that DefAnition
C'mon dog, what's your issue?
I got my dogs on a mission
While you gettin' it, better get it
You know the laws ain't fuckin' with us
Might jaw one of these niggas
Fuck around and off one of these niggas
Every hit I might not remix it
'Cause niggas swagger jackin', leechin' the kid
All these Twitter niggas startin' these skinnies
You flexin' nigga, Dae Dae really be spendin'
That "Wat U Mean", play it back when you spin it
This just the beginning

[Chorus]
Came a long way from that four six
Long way from that Four Reasons
Came a long way from the nicks and pots
Long way from them dirty blocks
Same shit, gotta change, this shit here get old
Same niggas act so hard when they around they folks
A lot of niggas up and left, I had to close that door
A lot of niggas needed my help and I was there for 'em

[Verse 2]
I needed your help, no y'all wasn't there
Try to be the man they want me to be but I ain't perfect
Sometimes I'm hurtin', you don't realize until I burst
I get high and I forget that shit, I don't reply to the noises
Let me make a couple wishes, take my brother out of prison
Put my niggas in position
And run me up a couple million
But that money bring that problems don't it
Niggas plottin', wanna rob you huh
I ain't trippin', got that Glock on me
I'ma shoot, you just drop homie
Come here, they have low tolerance
One of the hottest, they copying
Fuck is you talking, no stopping him
No wonder these niggas ain't liking him
No wonder they dying to act like him
No wonder they know that I'm out of here
Driving this whip like a spaceship
Pussy nigga better not say shit
Spence and Nitti, I went apeshit
And I did it like a real nigga
Name a nigga out here fucking with me
I came a long way
From grinding these streets, I'm talking bottom
Four Seasons Boulevard and Irving Street

[Chorus]
Came a long way from that four six
Long way from that Four Reasons
Came a long way from the nicks and pots
Long way from them dirty blocks
Same shit, gotta change, this shit here get old
Same niggas act so hard when they around they folks
A lot of niggas up and left, I had to close that door
A lot of niggas needed my help and I was there for 'em
