[Verse 1]
Okay, me I'm 'bout the money, fuck the fame yeah
I'ma stack the money with the gang yeah
Smokin' out that Backwood like a tank, yeah
Dae Dae havin' racks, bitch what you think, yeah
Know I gotta hit 'em with another one
No I cannot sit bitch, I can't cuddle up
Yeah I know I'm rich but bitch I'm harm as fuck
And I'm on my shit, take care my mama, yeah
And I'm having kids, shit like five of 'em
And I copped a crib for all five of 'em
I gotta keep it real with all five of 'em
If I ain't in the Sprinter putting miles on it

[Chorus]
Know I'm in the trap with my mans 'dem (in the trap)
You trippin' 'bout this nat, she been ran through ('bout this nat)
I'm probably in the back, bitch I'm grooving (in the back yeah)
If you ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, keep it moving (keep it moving)
I might get mad when I'm losing (keep it moving)
I bounce back, bitch I do this (just keep it moving)
If she ain't bad and she ain't boujee (she keep it moving)
Moving, moving

[Verse 2]
Gang shit, pull up where you claim nigga
No main ho, my baby mama paid nigga (Keisha)
No lames though, that's just how I was raised nigga (believe 'dat)
On the block with my motherfuckin' neighbors
I got a Glock, that motherfucker everywhere where I be
I put a rock in the trap with my daddy
Stain shit, pull up take your stain nigga
Blue Flame, fuck it make it rain nigga
Anyway, you miss me with that lame shit (nigga no way)
I'm the type to pull up where you hangin' (at your door way)
Better sit up when I come in, I'ma make niggas (sit up)
Got a bitch countin' hundreds for the fuckin' kid (count them hundreds)

[Chorus]
Know I'm in the trap with my mans 'dem (in the trap)
You trippin' 'bout this nat, she been ran through ('bout this nat)
I'm probably in the back, bitch I'm grooving (in the back yeah)
If you ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, keep it moving (keep it moving)
I might get mad when I'm losing (keep it moving)
I bounce back, bitch I do this (just keep it moving)
If she ain't bad and she ain't boujee (she keep it moving)
Moving, moving

[Verse 3]
All type of hustler, nigga hustling
In the trenches, on the block with all my cousins 'dem
Know that Glock in my prescence, I ain't trusting shit
I fuck with opps, I fuck with bloods, I fuck with cuz 'dem
Niggas hate but know it's love, that's on my end
Knees scrubbed on that rug, I got my ass kicked
Out that mud like I'm Suge
Now I'm getting a dub even when the books bad
Told this lil ho go'n with all that lame shit though
I'm tryna stack them hundreds with my gang gang
I was in Miami with the homie Quan and Dae Dae
They rollin' plain jane
They on the same thing
Said they lookin' for me, I'm in the trap

[Chorus]
Know I'm in the trap with my mans 'dem (in the trap)
You trippin' 'bout this nat, she been ran through ('bout this nat)
I'm probably in the back, bitch I'm grooving (in the back yeah)
If you ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, keep it moving (keep it moving)
I might get mad when I'm losing (keep it moving)
I bounce back, bitch I do this (just keep it moving)
If she ain't bad and she ain't boujee (she keep it moving)
Moving, moving
