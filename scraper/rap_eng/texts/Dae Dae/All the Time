[Intro]
Yeah, you maybe tell me you been hating on me all the time
All the time, all the time
Yeah, momma told me that this shit gon happen all the time
All the time, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
All the time
We run up in your check like all the time
Nigga act like they my friend I know the time
I’m a pray for a nigga I know at times
The business came fully loaded all the time
The business came with some hoes all the time
All this time I thought this bitch would hold me down
Now all this time I know they glitching hold me down
All the time, all the time

[Verse 1]
If I needed you I told that fire I needed two
Ain’t gon lie I’m in the streets
Can’t let them trick me on these streets
I’ve been flexing ever since
If I be weak my medicine
I’ve been juggling ever since I moved that brick and spin that shit
Cool it since the mode had been for whoever hating, I’m tired a this
I’m a shoot, I won’t miss, get out my way when I got sticks
Can’t lose, I got kids, I got niggas signed to me
I got rules if you ain’t got money keep that bullshit round from me
She ain’t love me, get a check
The check all the time, planning for the check
All the time, bitch I’m at yo neck
Whoa, all the time
All the time, bitch I do this all the time
All the time

[Hook]
Get it all the time
We run up in your check like all the time
Nigga act like they my friend I know the time
I’m a pray for a nigga I know at times
The business came fully loaded all the time
The business came with some hoes all the time
All this time I thought this bitch would hold me down
Now all this time I know they glitching hold me down
All the time, all the time

[Verse 2]
They had me riled up why you posting mami all the time
Cause all the time I been waiting on me I’m bout to shine
I took this fine goon shit up to another level
I asked the homies for help but ain’t nobody help em
Them niggas used to be with me tryna compete with me
I got the pounds in and they didn’t buy no weed for me
Still got them bands for the cheap and I’m flooding streets
Like get a thousand pounds every week for a stack a piece
I hit the hogga golla I hear these niggas screaming
They’ll never speak of loyalty if you don’t know the meaning
Fuck them and they team though these niggas ain’t deep enough
I’m ready to show a nigga if they don’t believe enough

[Hook]
All the time
We run up in your check like all the time
Nigga act like they my friend I know the time
I’m a pray for a nigga I know at times
The business came fully loaded all the time
The business came with some hoes all the time
All this time I thought this bitch would hold me down
Now all this time I know they glitching hold me down
All the time, all the time
