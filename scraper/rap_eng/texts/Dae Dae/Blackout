[Intro: Lil Keed]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what? Say what? Baby girl, say what?
No, don't need no touch-ups, yeah
Let's go, let's go

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, diamonds on me, it'll never be a blackout
We put drums on the stick, come to the block and rock out
Yeah she tricky, yeah she lick it, yeah she leave my lights out
I smoke exotic with exotic bitches, that's my lifestyle
I touch her body so politely
Keep that pussy bald-head for me
I fuck on her, now she want two-fifty beads, yeah
Got her wrapped 'round my finger, now she cannot leave
Get you hung like some hangers if you try to play with me
How you in the slime pit but you don't know Bleveland streets?
We'll lead you on when you get left in the creek
YSL stoned, who gettin' higher than we?

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
What is you on? What you wanna do tonight?
Henny patron, it could be a long night
We can fuck all night, scream, baby, it's alright
They bitin' drip, it's alright
You can bet it, my money right
Take you shopping alright
Yeah, they'll catch you lackin' alright
Just left the studio from puttin' in overtime
Then I go to her house and put in overtime
Deep tissue, get a bankroll at Jeju's
Anything you want, you can get it
And we smoking dank, not no reggie, no midget
Two-fifty, that Richard Mille cost a ticket
She don't even know what it was, she said her ex-nigga was slippin'
I was in two-fifty off Bleveland, up in them trenches
And I'll make her proud of me, no Penny
Gucci loafers on my feet, no, not penny, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, diamonds on me, it'll never be a blackout
We put drums on the stick, come to the block and rock out
Yeah she tricky, yeah she lick it, yeah she leave my lights out
I smoke exotic with exotic bitches, that's my lifestyle
I touch her body so politely
Keep that pussy bald-head for me
I fuck on her, now she want two-fifty beads, yeah
Got her wrapped 'round my finger, now she cannot leave
Get you hung like some hangers if you try to play with me
How you in the slime pit but you don't know Bleveland streets?
We'll lead you on when you get left in the creek
YSL stoned, who gettin' higher than we?

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Hellcat, the fast-lane
Smash that, switchin' lanes
Big racks at the bank
And you mad 'cause you can't
And I'm dripped up like this drank
Never slippin', what you think?
Two on me like it's a tank
This shit on me, niggas hate
Gold on me, real plates
Fors on that bitch skate
Rose gold, my bitch wait
Bitches tryna kiss my face, slime
Two-fifty, hold up, house two-sixty (Damn)
Mouth ooh in it
Uh, yeah, we in the city
Hold up, I touch her body lightly, woo
She got that top, yeah she do
Ridin' with the top of the high, we do, yeah
Baby, you get money? Yeah, me too (Yeah, me too)
Wanna know the slime shit, Keed too (My slime)
Gucci you down if I need to, yeah
My brother, he down if you bleedin' too
I brought out that one and I ain't mean to

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Yeah, diamonds on me, it'll never be a blackout
We put drums on the stick, come to the block and rock out
Yeah she tricky, yeah she lick it, yeah she leave my lights out
I smoke exotic with exotic bitches, that's my lifestyle
I touch her body so politely
Keep that pussy bald-head for me
I fuck on her, now she want two-fifty beads, yeah
Got her wrapped 'round my finger, now she cannot leave
Get you hung like some hangers if you try to play with me
How you in the slime pit but you don't know Bleveland streets?
We'll lead you on when you get left in the creek
YSL stoned, who gettin' higher than we?
