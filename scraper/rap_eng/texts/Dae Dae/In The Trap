[Chorus]
In the trap with this lil tender (believe it)
Still trappin' in December (woo, burr)
I'ma get it if they pregnant
Bitch I'm Dae Dae, I'ma spend it (spend that shit)
Yeah, hoes feelin' like I'm trippin' (oh yeah, for real?)
Bitch you ain't get none of these pennies (oh hell nah)
I'm tryna stack this shit for Christmas (stack it)
I'm tryna stack and get a million (Dae Dae)

[Verse 1]
Dependent on them niggas, that ain't me, no
I'm clutching on that trigger through that peephole
She come in, when I fuck her she do deepthroat
I fuck her, I don't trust her, that's just sleep though
You cuff her and you love her, what you mean though?
I double up them cups when I'm on lean ho
I double up, I muscle up for my team though
I show love, I take pictures in the trenches ho
Back then, I was hustlin', trappin'
I'm Love Life, they wonder why I'm laughing
MAC-10, shoot it with a passion
Let off all this pressure that I'm going through
My brother still in the chain gang
My other bitch she on that lame shit
I'm steady depositing the bank bitch
In the trap, in the trap

[Chorus]
In the trap with this lil tender (in the trap)
Still trappin' in December (in the trap)
I'ma get it if they pregnant (in the trap)
Bitch I'm Dae Dae, I'ma spend it (spend that shit, in the trap)
Yeah, hoes feelin' like I'm trippin' (in the trap)
Bitch you ain't get none of these pennies (in the trap)
I'm tryna stack this shit for Christmas (in the trap)
I'm tryna stack and get a million

[Verse 2]
Tryna get the millions, keep them haters out your business
Out the creek with my niggas, out the streets with my niggas, do you feel me?
Ain't got time for you broke hoes
'Bout to stack a lil bit more
I'm tryna get it by the boatload
Flip it, get it, and go
Bitch I'm icy, lit at nighty
What's your pricing, this shit priceless
On that bike lift, this shit like Timmy
Yeah you right I'm crippin', I'm tryna get the millions
Bitch I'm in the trap

[Chorus]
In the trap with this lil tender (in the trap)
Still trappin' in December (in the trap)
I'ma get it if they pregnant (in the trap)
Bitch I'm Dae Dae, I'ma spend it (spend that shit, in the trap)
Yeah, hoes feelin' like I'm trippin' (in the trap)
Bitch you ain't get none of these pennies (in the trap)
I'm tryna stack this shit for Christmas (in the trap)
I'm tryna stack and get a million

[Outro]
In the trap, in the trap
In the trap, in the trap
In the trap, in the trap
In the trap, in the trap
Love Life
