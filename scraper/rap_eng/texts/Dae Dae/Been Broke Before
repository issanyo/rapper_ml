[Chorus]
Yea I remember being down bad and broke before
Now I'm up I'm not looking back no more hoe
Give a fuck how you feel bitch I'm on go
Shoot this motherfucker up right now don't play[?]
I go beat up on a beat
I'm coming straight out the streets, I bought a spot I don't lease
I told my lil hoe I need all my clothes neat
I got a bad bitch named Onik ( she like whoa)
She having swag she from 4 seasons(from the 4 yea)
Don't make her mad give ya one reason, one reason

[Verse1: dae Dae]
I just signed my deal I got my royal[?] (all of it)
I can't go out bad for a hoe not me (not a bitch)
Yo Rolex ain't talking bout nothing that shit sucker free (fake as shit)
I'm trapping out the trap with a whole key
These niggas holding me
Who fuckin with me, I'm the hardest out the city

[Chorus]
I remember being down bad and broke before
Yea I remember being down bad and broke before
Now I'm up I'm not looking back no more hoe
Give a fuck how you feel bitch I'm on go
Shoot this motherfucker up right now don't play[?]
I go beat up on a beat
I'm coming straight out the streets, I bought a spot I don't lease
I told my lil hoe I need all my clothes neat

[Verse2: Dae Dae]
That lil bitch right there bodacious
We keep nobody in our business
When I splurge I hurt they feelings
Boy do you know who you dealing with
I wouldn't turn another nigga bitch up for no reason
I fucked her good, I fucked her good I got her soul leaking
Why I do this shit , why I do this shit I got 5 reasons, I got 5 reasons
Why I smoke this weed, why I smoke this weed cause it make shit feel so easy
I'm rocking that Burberry
Fuck yo bitch then I leave I won't come back like a error
In order for black people to stick together gotta bang by letters
Only thing we having going on wrong is everybody get jealous
We'll kill ya for some Margiela's, Come on man we got to do better
Everybody love life we gotta check on them


I remember being down bad and broke before (2x)
Now I'm up I'm not looking back no more hoe
Shoot this motherfucker up right now don't play[?]
Don't play don't play
