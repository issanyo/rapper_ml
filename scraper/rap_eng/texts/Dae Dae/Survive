[Chorus]
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy

[Verse 1]
Dae Dae, know they gon’ hate
That’s what comes with this music shit
Goin’ dumb, I ain’t stuntin’ no bitch
A lot of ones, I’m in Magic City
I scrape the crumbs out that kitchen
A couple bombs, I’m working with it
In the storm I was gettin’ it
I was armed with that Glizzy
Off that crack give me a minute
The best dope like my verse
I’m Steph Curry at my worst
Damn, I ain’t trippin’, I ain’t worried
Smokin’ cookie, me and Spiffy
Cookin’ up, doing dishes
Bitch we going up on our digits
So tell them niggas come on with it
Ain’t even legendary but I’m legendary
When I was young I ain’t tell a tale
They said I was the bomb back in February
Put some extra charms on my little girl
Sir you’re doing what I done did
And I’m doing it for the convicts
And I just talked to bid, I just told ‘em that

[Chorus]
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy

[Verse 2]
Got ‘em heated at me
I ain’t seen you in these streets
I ain’t mean to do the beat like this
Thought I told ‘em that I eat like this
Twenty-four, young nigga buying this shit
Close my door, bitch I ain’t leasing shit
I’m unloading ‘bout that Love Life shit
And my car got towed before I signed
I was told it was a sign
Sometimes you gotta let go
See sometimes you gotta act broke
Shit ain’t no pressure but I ain’t letting up (Dae Dae)
I want extra, I want extra
Get the message, get the message
If you don’t you go and get it
Young Dae Dae, born gifted
Watch ‘em rise, he gon’ rise
When I was young I used to be shy
Guess he was tired, he was tired
When it’s your time, it’s your time

[Chorus]
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy
It’s all about how you survive
Niggas ain’t really ‘bout that life
Yeah I can see it in your eyes
Put that fire on you and you’ll cry
Ain’t no dodgin’, all my niggas ridin’
Watch the tars, I know them niggas ridin’
Ain’t no borrowin’, I got my own money
Now it’s twenty for a show dummy

[Outro]
Love Life, Love Life
Spiffy what up fool?
This a hit nigga
A real one
