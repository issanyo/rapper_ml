[Hook: TK Kravitz]
You gotta represent your side
All day, all night
Don't call my phone
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride
Oh no, (we got London on the track)

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
I got no trouble, stack that dough I got like 5 kids
You ain't got no trouble, hate on me cause you ain't doing shit
One (?) I talked to my daughter
I just told her don't fall in love with no baller
Please baby be patient
Cause these niggas be chasing anything that's basic
Baby you're not basic
Got a smile just like your daddy
Meanwhile we about average
Don't stop what you're doing baby
Cause I know they on they hate shit
Don't you tell me baby, I know I ain't shit
Won't you tell me I am the greatest bitch
Gave my ho a Benz, not a Volvo
Boulevard I woulda ran off
Every street, that's where I from

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
You gotta represent your side
All day, all night
Don't call my phone
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride

[Verse 2: TK Kravitz]
I lost a friend yesterday
I found out he was fake
Oh man, Christ sakes
I gotta change now, fuck waiting
Man I've been real since day one, you can say
Where that loyalty? I ain't never play
Middle finger to the law
Oh man, free my dawg

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
You gotta represent your side
All day, all night
Don't call my phone
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride
If you ain't gon' ride
Oh no, (we got London on the track)

[Outro]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
