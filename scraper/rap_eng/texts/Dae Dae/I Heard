[Intro: Kap G]
Yeah, ah, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Kap G]
I heard they was talkin' shit about me, yeah, fuck 'em though
I ain't really pressed, I got shooters everywhere I know
You know they can't stop it, you know we gon' pop shit
Couple racks in my pocket, you know they can't stop it, yeah
I can't even lie, man, yeah, I been broke before
Buy my bitch some Gucci, open toe and she emotional
You know they can't stop it, you know we some bosses
Stack them bricks like some houses, we came up from the losses

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Yo, what you know 'bout struggles? Yeah
What you know 'bout hustle? Yeah
Big boss like Russel, yeah
Bust it down, no shuttle, yeah
First I got off my mama couch
Then I went bought my mom a house
Then I went to your daughter house
Kill that pussy like slaughter house, yeah
I done been through so much shit, don't know how to lose
I just might go and meet the plug up in Honolulu
First I got that check, they be talkin' out they neck
Swear I got play like chess 'cause I'ma win with no regrets, yeah
Quit all that cappin', we ain't havin' it, man
Shout out to trouble, who reppin' it, man

Got a bitch from Hooters, who be servin' the wings
Yeah, I got Royce with me
Yeah, Royce, Royce with me
Yeah, I buy more Fendi
Yeah, all these foreign women


[Chorus: Kap G]
I heard they was talkin' shit about me, yeah, fuck 'em though
I ain't really pressed, I got shooters everywhere I know
You know they can't stop it, you know we gon' pop shit
Couple racks in my pocket, you know they can't stop it, yeah
I can't even lie, man, yeah, I been broke before
Buy my bitch some Gucci, open toe and she emotional
You know they can't stop it, you know we some bosses
Stack them bricks like some houses, we came up from the losses

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Know I took a couple losses
Trappin' hard in apartments
Got the game from the OGs
Couple lame niggas showed me
Got to keep them same niggas round me
A couple chains, not too much bling
I stay down with these Cuban links
No way I'm lyin', you can Google me
Might be fine but what you gon' do for me?
You might be a dime but you slackin' 3
Hard times back in '03
My last time I had to pack and leave
Still grindin', me and Kap G
You gon' shine, just keep on pushin'
Caught 'em by surprise with this one
Hope when I die, I be real one
Got to multiply when you get it
Look in his eyes so you can feel me
I know you gon' ride with the king
I know you gon' slide with the stick
You know I was a proper king
Know I was a doctor with them bricks
You know I had to ask 'em on them streets
Had to pack it, watch 'em holdin' me
Glock is on me 'cause

[Chorus: Kap G & Dae Dae]
I heard they was talkin' shit about me, yeah, fuck 'em though
I ain't really pressed, I got shooters everywhere I know
You know they can't stop it, you know we gon' pop shit
Couple racks in my pocket, you know they can't stop it, yeah
I can't even lie, man, yeah, I been broke before
Buy my bitch some Gucci, open toe and she emotional
You know they can't stop it, you know we some bosses
Stack them bricks like some houses, we came up from the losses

[Outro: Kap G]
Talkin' shit, fuck 'em though
