Spend that shit, spend that shit

[Verse 1]
Let that money talk, let that money talk
You dead broke, that's your daddy fault
I'm high horse, you asphalt
Your Rollie fake, that shit unthawed
Both a bulldog, knock your block off
I smoke rapper weed, this that moon rock
I'm certified, you minimised
I'm maximised, look in my eyes
Don't fuckin' lie, don't be surprised
They legally blind, don't wanna see me shine
Signed my first deal, about time
All that penny pinchin' that you do, you better

[Hook]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend a check and get it right back

[Verse 2]
20, 40, 60, 80 100s with me
2,000 dollar pants, I'm a stunna, bitch
Hit the block and get it, I got options listed
Back when I was 9, my favorite game was blitzin'
Bitch I ain't got no sense, I just spend the shit
You just start gettin' money, why you new to this?
All that shit you got, I been had that shit
And I don't fuck with her, too much baggage
Bitch I'm what's happenin', your campaign nothin'
You thought you had me, bitch I'm Bin Ladin
Percs got me itchin', all this money stickin'
I don't fuckin' listen, my mama fuckin' trippin'
Talkin' 'bout that I...

[Hook]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend a check and get it right back
