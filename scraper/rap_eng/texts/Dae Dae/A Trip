[Hook: Quicktrip]
I just took a trip down in Tennessee
Tell that hoe don't trip, you can come with me
Only trip with diamonds on me, look like trick or treat
Ain't took that trip back the trenches, I'm still trappin'
I'm still trappin', I'm trappin'

[Verse 1: Quicktrip]
Lord knows how far I can go
Pockets slow, bitch don't slam my door
Bitch, I'm paid, young made man
Gettin' laid in that Escalate
DQ, the latest, so gold, Rollie gold
Niggas holdin' on me, don't know I keep 4
Not backin' down, man, I'm black and proud, man
I'm dope like I'm richer, boy, I fold like that 45
You fuck all you fuckin' like
I'm fuckin' your fuckin' bitch
The fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you, I'm fuckin' rich
Come back with that basic bitch
I'm back with that hangin' shit
Back where I fuckin' left
You back on the fuckin' shelf
Street money worldwide
RIP Bankroll Fresh
Be real, don't lie
Hate them motherfuckin' pimps

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Whole thing on the pot, nigga, where the scale?
I just called to play my partner, told 'em bring the bail
I just lost a whole dub, send it through the mail
I proceed, everybody else fail
Rich street nigga with a bank on me
Rich street nigga with a Rollie on me
Lame ass nigga keep holdin' on me
Lame ass hoe keep hatin' on me
Came through the hood, had 'em waitin' on me
New whip, ain't got a date on me
Tip that thing, had 'em played on me
Big Rollie, only got a face on me
Bitch, my name, put the face on me
Bitch, my name got weight on me
New whip, ain't had to wait on me
Spend that shit just like I'm Dae Dae
Got some niggas up in Memphis on Seventh Street
Heroin, young, hell yeah, they fuck with me
Black and white car, call my whip a refferee
Black bitch, white goods, call her panda, panda
I got broads in Atlanta and I got packs in Atlanta
Niggas need to up your stamina, fuckin' bitches on the camera
