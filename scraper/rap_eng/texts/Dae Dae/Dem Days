Intro:
Uh huh
Birthdays
Sometimes the worst days
Sometimes we, we celebrate, right?
This the celebration, turn it!

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them Lakewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal they say Dae Dae Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them niggas
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Verse #1:
Lakewood get a hoe down on Ashwood
I was sellin' dope my daddy had the soda
Yeah that trap was bangin' hard it was rollin'
I was 14, everything I had was stolen
I remember dark nights I had in that backway
Couldn't nothing come through without me in that backway (I remember)
Young nigga walkin' with that fire on me (Glock)
Yeah the only thing he love to do is shoot dice
Met my nigga Gotto on that brickwalk
Ooh don't make him mad don't make him pissed off
I remember them day they were them good days
I can never get them Lakewood days homie

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them Lakewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal they say Dae Dae Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them niggas
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Verse #2:
I remember hard days in that Lakewood
I remember dark days n' they feel good
Ain't no time to parlay make sure them kids good
Know some niggas that'll ride for me on Boone street
Know some niggas that'll die for me and lose for me
Know some niggas that'll split the pie and shoot for me
L-O-V-E, L-I-F-E, know we love life, over everything
Nigga no jewelry on Im'ma still bling
Bitch nigga turn that oven off, we got it hot up in this bitch
Free Kant, Free Lil Dida they got him ridin' in that bitch
15 years of his birthdays, them the worst days

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them Lakewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal, they say Dae Dae Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them niggas
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Outro:
Birthdays were the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them Lakewood days
(Days days, days days)
