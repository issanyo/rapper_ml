[Hook]
I'm fucking on this ho who I'm 'posed to be fucking
I'm fucking up this money I'm 'posed to be blowing
Counting all this money, got bruises on my thumbs
Cruising in that 6, I don't know where I'm going
Hitting all these bumps but I'm riding on Forgi's
Know these art, these not Ralph Laurens
See you tomorrow cause you acting bored
Don't you change when I finish touring

[Verse 1]
You feeling like I changed up
No, I'm feeling like you changed, yup
So your partner ain't backing down
Cause when we come bitch, we come lit
London on that same shit
We don't wanna play bitch
One of y'all but one of you out your lane shit
Cause we the ones that blame ya
But we the ones that hang low
Y'all the ones that lay low
I gave y'all a chance though
This what they paying for
Cuban links, Rollie AP
Fucked around and dipped it in the sink
Make that shit look drip like it's leaking
Fucking on this ho named Meisha

[Hook]
I'm fucking on this ho who I'm 'posed to be fucking
I'm fucking up this money I'm 'posed to be blowing
Counting all this money, got bruises on my thumbs
Cruising in that 6, I don't know where I'm going
Hitting all these bumps but I'm riding on Forgi's
Know these art, these not Ralph Laurens
See you tomorrow cause you acting bored
Don't you change when I finish touring

[Verse 2]
Act like you know when I walk through
24 show 10 for walk throughs
Jewelry come from ice box
Really making niggas pipe down
I'm with a whole lotta legends
This life I live, shit got numbers
I just bought my lil ho the bezels
I didn't wanna cut her out like scissors
Come to find out she the realest
Anything I ask for, she'll give it to me
She pulling up and she blunting me out
Her lil sister just find out

[Hook]
I'm fucking on this ho who I'm 'posed to be fucking
I'm fucking up this money I'm 'posed to be blowing
Counting all this money, got bruises on my thumbs
Cruising in that 6, I don't know where I'm going
Hitting all these bumps but I'm riding on Forgi's
Know these art, these not Ralph Laurens
See you tomorrow cause you acting bored
Don't you change when I finish touring

[Outro]
Don't you change, don't you change
I said don't you change, don't you change
Hey, hey
London Dae Dae
Don't you change, don't you change
I said don't you change, don't you change
