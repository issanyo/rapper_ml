[Chorus]
No I ain't perfect, no I ain't perfect
Niggas don't know me, nigga I came out that dirt
Niggas don't know I had the stick under my shirt
Man I ain't perfect, they killed my partner in person, I put my partner on my shirt
Ridin' with your friend, yeah, ayy
On that percocet ten yeah, ayy
Lamborghini with a ten on me, yeah yeah
No I ain't perfect nigga, no we ain't hurtin' bitch

[Verse 1]
Should've told 'em how I pulled up like I know you
I should've told 'em when I turnt up in that 'Nolia
I should've told 'em when I had it on my shoulder
I should've told 'em when the kid had to stay focused, yeah
No they ain't listen to 'em
Want me to fall but ain't gon' listen to 'em, no
All they ask is how you do it
How you do that? I just put my mind to it
She just put her mind to it, show her how to grind to it
I just pulled a mic out on 'em, she just went to rhyme into it
But they wanna fight out on 'em, I might put that ice on too
Ex bitch keep callin' me, little bitch I might not do it
Had your nigga DM-ing me, I might send my partners to 'em
Fans keep on filming me, I'll do whatever for 'em
Pops keep on telling me, they ain't doin' what you're doin'
Fame came and you're doing it, can't blame how you do it

[Chorus]
No I ain't perfect, no I ain't perfect
Niggas don't know me, nigga I came out that dirt
Niggas don't know I had the stick under my shirt
Man I ain't perfect, they killed my partner in person, I put my partner on my shirt
Ridin' with your friend, yeah, ayy
On that percocet ten yeah, ayy
Lamborghini with a ten on me, yeah yeah
No I ain't perfect nigga, no we ain't hurtin' bitch

[Verse 2]
I know you ain't with this
Flip a bankroll, show them niggas
Got my cake up, I'm the shit
And that K come with a dick
All that fake shit niggas see
All that racing that I did
All that cake up that you doin'
And go get you a benjamin
That that game I let you do it
Pray every night no weapons form against me
I'm out every night, I got that arm with me
I took a flight, cut off my phone, let me
No I ain't perfect, no I ain't perfect
Drive it like it's stolen, vibin', bitch I'm rollin'
Racks on me, me
Put your nats on a leash
Niggas copy, niggas holdin'
All that poppin' get you pokin'
All that cash come to me
All they rappers signed to me
Love Life, you judge a nigga but don't even know the man
No he ain't perfect
Cut this bitch off, I ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
No I ain't perfect, no I ain't perfect
Niggas don't know me, nigga I came out that dirt
Niggas don't know I had the stick under my shirt
Man I ain't perfect, they killed my partner in person, I put my partner on my shirt
