[Intro: Dae Dae]
Spend that shit

Spend a check and get it right back (Ooouuu!)

[Hook: Dae Dae]
Spend that shit (remix), spend that shit (remix)
Spend that shit (remix), spend that shit (remix)

Spend a check and get it right back
Spend that shit, spend that shit (remix)

Spend a check and get it right back (remix)
Spend a check and get it right back

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
Let them numbers talk, let them numbers talk
I'm rich as shit, I got too much sauce
Worked my ass off, I need my passport (I do)
They love me in London, this career here ain't promised
Don't understand all that mumblin'
Nigga, speak how you feel
What's the pressure and the hate for?
You only knew me 'bout a year
Went on that Thug tour (and what?)
And I went slept crazy
Now I'm on another tour (another one?)
They ain't doin' that in the A (oh no)
Couple jewels on me, lot of blues on me
A lot of tatted in the city
But niggas trippin' in the city
All that shootin' and that runnin'
Shoot innocent bystanders
So you call that gangsta? (That ain't gangsta)
Nigga better get you some money

[Hook: Dae Dae + (Young Thug)]
Spend that shit (YSL), spend that shit
Spend that shit (yeah, yeah), spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
(Spend a check and get it right back)
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend that shit (spend it, spend it), spend that shit (remix)
Spend that shit (brand new Bentley), spend that shit (spend it, nigga)
Spend a check and get it right back
(Spend it, get it right back)
Spend a check and get it right back

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Jeffery!
Jumanji boards
Get it, got Jumanji boards
More hoes than a body tell
And they all think I'm one on one
She sped off
Fuck around, took my meds off
My dogs wit' me baby, better call Petsmart
I just bought a big light
Bought it just to touch it for somethin'
And I heard your dope ain't nothing
You touch it, it bust for somethin'
It's not a discussion for somethin'
Hublot flooded for somethin'
Chain gang Kool-Aid pack, honey bun
I got a check for rando
I treat the best the family though
I might put a snake on all my collars
I don't care a boo when I'm sprinkling dollars
My molly is pink, no dolphin
Your weed is extinct, no coffin
I heard that you waitin' for somethin'
You better take over for somethin'
When you get it, spend that shit, nigga

[Hook: Dae Dae + (Young M.A)]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend a check and get it right back
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
(What up, Dae Dae?)
Spend a check and get it right back
(Ooouuu!)
Spend a check and get it right back

[Verse 3: Young M.A]
I got my money up, got my money up
Got the nina on me, I keep her tummy tucked
Ridin' 'round in that '87 bumpin' my shit (skrrt!)
50 bands in a rubber band on some block shit
She pop the pussy, I pop the tags, they pop shit
Pinkie ring all iced out on some rock shit
Golddiggers try to suck me up on some mop shit
But I'm Money Mitch, I'm broke, baby, I ain't got shit
Kill that shit, I'ma kill that shit
I'ma kill that shit, I'ma kill that shit
I kill her shit and send her right back
I kill her shit and send her right back

[Outro: Young Thug]
You gotta spend a check, get it right back
You gotta blow a check, you gon' get it right back
If you ever cry with checks, might not get every back
