[Verse 1: Hemlock Ernst]
Take me down to merriweather
Horse follow the preakness
Caged back callin' my weakness
Feel in the dark for a warm body
Now it’s cold september weather
Whether or not my eyes open
I’m still
Defined by my cold iron will
Skill set
The pencil chopper
Tongue skipper
Honey dips and proper
Etiquette when talkin' to the old folks
Miss my grandmothers like my old home
Welcome on the stepping stone
Wipe your feet at the mat
Defeat is a trap
Don’t let your fears be the key to the gat
I remind myself and leave it at that
To resurrect the hymnal
Psalm the prophet with the pen stroke
To mend you
But whats left for me
Just rings in an empty cup a coffee
No misery in company
No company can calm me
So I sit and ponder doing laundry
Need to be the man my mother raised
Not the one society engaged

That had me falling into a trap
Blind-sided by my vision of rap
Starry eyed in the chrism of daps
I fell a victim to it
A younguns mind can’t make sense of the intricate movements
Or make amends with the symptoms that prove what we see
Ain’t as simple as it seems in the movies

[Verse 2: Hemlock Ernst]
Film rolls the body easy
In a sulfur 3 piece
Caught in the negative space
Below the deep sea
Shoot me in the 360
The angel treaty
Embalm the dark beneath me
My heart a burning teepee
Out in the plains
Hush the battle cry at dusk
Uranium for pennies busk
As the tall grass weaves through a people crushed
What’s it all mean
The sky recalls my empathy
A bald beam
Built a castle in the sand
The light inside my hand
Divided by my passions and my plans
Always been an honest man
But not always honest man
That’s just the circumstance of chance
Life chooses ya path and takes the freedom from ya hands
With freedom gotta understand
We gotta free ourselves from land
Cuz we ain’t free in this world, where we can’t be
So I float above my peers
So I can see the fears
In the eyes of man

What the eye believes the consciousness perceives
My confidence to be
Is my power I believe
Monopolies on truth
A monopoly of greed
A prophecy for you and me

They pray for me
They pray for me
They pray for me
But I don’t need their prayers
Just another cup of coffee
Pour it tall and strong
Fill it up and watch me burn
Cuz my lungs' strenght to cigarettes return
And my head's heavy, but there's much to be learned
