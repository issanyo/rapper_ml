In the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind

Oh, in the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind

As the wind dripped through chrysalis
My avarice buried the threats
Mysteries carried my mind swept
Away with the tides tinged
Mention my blindness
Only to find friends
Hoping for sympathy
At times when
I don’t believe in myself
When I relieve from my shelf
Shells picked up now patronized
Monuments to times when i was searching to find
Merging my center uncertain
With saviors I’ve been virgin
With nature I’ve been assertive
Cuz I don’t want my spiritual fucked with
The way that the body’s gifts get plucked quick
And cherry’s pop on these cherry tops
On blacktops we played ball like the world had stopped
McCoy was the real when the key was at home
Around the world in a Tyner song

Around the wolrd
While you was out coppin a feel
I was down on the reel to reel
When you was out huntin a deal
I was down on the reel to reel
I was down on the reel to reel
How you feel

So I tried to put it on the paper better
Tried to make it redder put the passion in the letters
I just wanted it to last forever
You lose a friend every time that you can’t break a tether
And we ain’t free at last
Or free and lost
And freedom’s cost is freedoms path
And life isn’t free but it was given to me
So now I’m given to you the bit that’s thickening me
Hard hearted now it’s just like a prison to me
And why the cage bird sings
Because it can
Just that thought…it’s like a religion to me
But what is god if they taken bodies, before they meant to be
Feel like i been here a century
The past 8 months felt like 8 years
Sitting thinkin bout it
Recounting old loves and new fears
And 2016’s just disappeared
Then again, it’s almost new years

In the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind

In the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind

In the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind

In the land, in the land
Cats close at hand
Move on to better lands
Heaven is that state of mind
