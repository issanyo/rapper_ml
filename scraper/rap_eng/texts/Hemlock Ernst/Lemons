[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle and Serengeti]
Keep the us with the uses and the yous with the yous
Ya'll know everything and we're still confused
In the suburbs drinking inner city booze
Keep the us with the uses and the yous with the yous

[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Everybody loves a rich man, would this be on my kinsmen?
I'll travel 'round, beyond beyond and left to know and [?]
Look at what my daddy did, my daddy be like heritage
I'm 33, he 46, my bitch be on my daddy's dick

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
I know the best room is a blessed the internet tuner
I bodyslam this guy on a boat like Lex Luger
Still narcissist, and skeet shooters kill partridges
How they get the whole game in these little cartridges?

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Dedicate young, got that fever
You could shake like Roger Ebert
I'ma sing a song like Jason Segel
I'ma get paid like Al Capone
You'll be like, "That boy did yoga
Didn't know he spoke Kyoto
Sounded like he Japanese"
I'ma sing a song, my rapper key
Bitch be on...

[Verse 4: Open Mike Eagle]
I've never seen my mom and pops together
They had a relationship and I am its fossil record
Call me Dr. Hossenfeffer, call me Dr. Awesome Sweater
Fuck it! Call me Dr. Pepper, yeah
People say I'm pretty clever with the penmanship
They start to say it then I never hear the end of it
The student loan stings, I never paid the whole thing
So I tense up anytime my fucking phone rings

[Verse 5: Hemlock Ernst]
Tar paper the bartender
Back handed with rye whiskey
Off center, I’m all winter
Starter jackets in city center
Dinner plans in rental vans
Candy coated my nursery
Seed planted in alley way
Crack sprouts a few orange trees
Olaf grieved
Blind with mother's tongue we hung 'round
Sunny streets
Feel the rays
Sing with Charles
Now in charge
Girl's got bars
El DeBarge
Kick the sand
Seal that circle
Friends with fans
Sometimes fuck, like Ghostface say
No hello goodbye yesterday

[Verse 6: Open Mike Eagle]
I live in the whiskey, I forgot how the cola tastes
I spaced and woke up at this one frozen yoghurt place
Sprinkled around yoghurt-eating people
And I don't even eat frozen yoghurt
True story!

[Verse 7: Serengeti]
Find some love and sell the autos, drugs
Dress the bitch, I took a club
On horse patrol, I lose control
On a trail seconds late
Find my line, you a 'gator
Take your cash like a waiter
Gallop through the mountain scapes
On horse patrol you can't escape

[Verse 8: Hemlock Ernst]
I's on a plane
Tomorrow I’ll be on a train
The next one I’ll be on a plane
Meet future versions of myself
In open plains
Laid to rest
Come to nest
Some to sleep
Under sheets
Curse the day
Curse the grave
No hello goodbye yesterday

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle and Serengeti]
Keep the us with the uses and the yous with the yous
Ya'll know everything and we're still confused
In the suburbs drinking inner city booze
Keep the us with the uses and the yous with the yous

[Outro: Serengeti]
Yous
Yous with the yous
Us with the uses and the yous with the yous
Catch me on a beach, 'bout to take a cruise
'Bout to go to the mall and buy me some shoes
Buy me some booze, need to get some clues
Ya'll motherfuckers wanna win, I wanna lose
That's not the cruise
This is the cruise
Me and--
(Yeah, alright)
