[Verse 1: Hemlock Ernst]
Backseat driver
Last one to notice
Turning straight into the driveway
First to point the difference between the chorus and the side chain
Eyes on the prize
Never prized for their eyes
Hatfull of hollows
Baby picture follows
Face formed in a wincing gasp
Basked in the mincemeet aroma
From my grandma’s pad
Walking down atlantic
Turning off of bogue
I was never vogue
Now I vogue to watch the faces glow

My hair falling down, not over my eyes
But under table with the roaches and the curly fries
Scattered mice nibbling on these kernels of corn
Trinity scorned like my throat’s trestle

Just where the dust settles
Make a bed right where my hats at
But talk first with the chimps and the lab rats
Read a storybook from my childhood
Like “Papa look, I made a hole and dug it too!”
What have I got to lose?

I ran faster than my shoes, and they said it was impossible (what have I got to lose?)
I made a castle out of greens and blue and they said it was impossible (what have I got to lose?)
Yo, I can jump higher than the moon
And they said it was impossible (what have I got to prove)
Wish I could go back to my childhood but I’ve got other stuff to do and they say it isn't possible

[Verse 2: Luchbag]
A fake wise man said nothing is more probable
So I got it tattooed and pretended educated truths weren't audible
And my moms is responsible for rearing the fake modest oddest ball u know

It's so many ins and outs, it's so many instances of doubt
That I just shut my mouth and keep quiet 'bout
Out of shame for not believing in myself half as much as everybody else does
Why it don't work when I give myself a hug, I believe god can speak but it seldom does

So I'm trying hard not to be a loner anymore & I'm trying hard to believe I don't gotta be alone anymore
Cause she's sleeping on phone write now while I write this down
And hope the clicks from the virtual keyboard don't wake her
Cause she got work in the morning and I don't wanna break her
She worries that she was meant for more than a salary, (& she's right)
Even tho her whole entire family is proud as can be
I don't know if Adam was real or just a literary device but I'm adamant you feel like the space between my ribs where another one used to be and that's a little scary at night
When the dark parts of me get afraid that I might be bright

Being light is something I can't bring myself to take lightly
Why do good things happen to dumb dudes like me?
Why do good things happen to dumb dudes like me?

(stumble down the street awkwardly, I am only ways that I've got to be)
