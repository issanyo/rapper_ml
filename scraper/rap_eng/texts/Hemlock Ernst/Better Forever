[Verse 1: Butch Dawson]
Knock knock who is it (yo yo open up)
This young Butchy I got hold of ya digits
I just came through and thought I'd pay you a visit
Ya boy down bad so Ima need you to listen
Ok
Remember when I had the job at the dental school
I simmer through the memories of getting them residuals
From filing no exemptions
Now it's fucking up the pensions
Who invented IRS
I can't be fucking with you niggas
Got shit to buy
I ride with no ties
Slide wit no glide
I mind my own business
Really stuck in lab I'm at it like chemist
Ya bastard got feelings
Well mine still diminished
Fine I still kick it
Push it
Still whip it
Pull it
I got dope in my socks
She wanna hit it
Sniff it
That's a deal for real
I want mills for real
I smoke and toke blunts full of thrill for real
In a secretive way
I succeed everyday
When it's all in my head
Ima need it to stay
I was good before but now I'm better forever
I was good before but now I’m better forever

[Chorus]
What, What
What, What
What, What
What, What
What, What
What, What

[Verse 2: Hemlock Ernst]
Moving on calloways no tees we mini mooching
Lingering waves no battle plays no heavy shooting
Bangaranging them salad days
We hooking cookies
Talk to my bookie i’m busy like bees shaking knees 
Nieces and nephews deposit give em half of my profit
Since Fonzarelli no mozzarella checks at the deli
They need two forms of i.d. I need sources to bleed
Forcing the corpses to hammer dance stamping the fortress
Chores for divorces i’m Even Steven lamp on my the porches
I hug the heater three sweaters see the breathing i’m leaving
Graces and traces no love jones three in a row creeping
Broke dick love sick cold and alone eating
Pockets were bone peaked
Now they with gold leaking
Still we need home teaching dome reaching gone leave it
Chilling with my pit bull brindle at home thinking
Nothing better than home except when i’m in my zone speaking
