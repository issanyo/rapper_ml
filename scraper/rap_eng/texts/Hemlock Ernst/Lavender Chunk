[Verse 1: Hemlock Ernst]
Forced to battle in life, or rather in death
Strange feeling like a pebble in my instep subtext
Animates in cortex, searching in that silence
Stepping stone, now slumped on her front door step
Sometimes things come to me
Sometimes I come to things
In light love covers me but it says I'm bad company
Misery hates bumbling my ex's date bumblebees
All honey, no sting, what's the fun in that? (don't fuck with me)
I haven't slept in weeks since she said she needed time to think
I had the time to think and then I spoke til she was past the brink
Now I'm raking rocks
Meditating on taking my socks off
I should probably just go out and get my rocks off
But I'm forced, in life or rather in death
Strange feeling like a pebble in my instep, what's next?
I resort to unkindness
Projection of my pedicure
Sensitive in paramour, artifice - my art of war
Detriment to self is pestilence, breaking cabin doors
Waxing on the floor
Waning in the core
Bobbing on the shore
Half in silence, eyes part to dilate
The rhizome of my violence
Years upon my waking
Childhood as a symptom to be taking
Veering by the caterwauling as dreams appear
A deleterious mind makes for delirious fears
Good thing I have these miracle ears
What do we have here?

[Verse 2: Scallops Hotel]
I hope we don't, cross paths on a dark ave
Stark mad like Jon Snow
Justified like Raylan Givens
I don't give a fuck about the first place ribbons
I need, more than that
At least a quarter sack for this fucking poltergeist
That forces me to write on the nightly
Like I'm Spike Lee
The joints embers glow, outside
Midst the first November snow
I'm insulated, ingratiated myself to the fools and jesters
Learned from my errors and called my mom a lot
Cried in a couple coffee shops
It's all love like Myka 9
Imma get mine, donâ€™t trip

[Hook X7: Scallops Hotel]
Brothers like me don't live too long
That's why I have to write so many rap songs
