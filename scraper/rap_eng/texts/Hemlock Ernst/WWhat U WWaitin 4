It’s not often that we get miracles, love
So I've got the best of all worlds

[Verse 1]
She said that she can’t get a hold of me
She can’t get a hold of me
Said a prayer with a rosery
Why I feel like we ain’t supposed to be
Everytime time I go you run and leave
The way you talkin' to me it ain’t like we use to be
Standing close to each other we can hardly reach
It’s like we cannot see what we're grown to be
I wanna tell you everything girl but talk is cheap
I tried to hold your hands but you don’t like it
Saying nothing much so how can I hide it

[Chorus: Hemlock Ernst]
Dreams are taking a toll for this
I can see
(Who we are)
Some things better than gold
Taking over the sea

[Verse 2: Hemlock Ernst]
Elapsed in a dark world
Strapped to a dart board
Eclipsed but the hand claps
And sprung like a clay mole
Erase more so you can grace more
Heartbeat like C4
Like watching ncb4 and nine4
Rock just a pebble then
A rebel then a level when
The sideways grin no runner up
Number up you'll timber backwards
Her hands was callace temples
Her legs were tinder palaces
Like running hands under water
While mother laughted so softly
Often puts hands on back
When barely coughing
Warm the sensations images
Temptations intimate
Leave silently and unlist the dying man
Nostalgic for the wonder why
Try again the past present
And silenced the forgotten gift
The mind switch
Wrapped elegantly in blue ribbon
Her hair was two griffens fighting
Over her perfect forehead
Force fed till four dead dying centipede
Believes sun rise darkened by moon demon
Gun violence lose speechless some in silent
Tight couplets are spinning spirals
My weaknes is keeping silenced
My vitals has no alliance
Stupidity I fight with violence
Lucidity I might recycle
Infinity is my life cycle
Indemnity is my survival
Serenity is not our title
Internally I burn the mic for you

[Chorus: Hemlock Ernst]
Dreams are taking a toll for this
I can see
(Who we are)
Some things better than gold
Taking over the sea

Watch it
Hey
