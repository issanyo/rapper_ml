[Verse 1]
Crash course in addiction
Venison to train tracks
Heavyweight of fiction, leave me at the One Stop
Credit to my pencil, parachute me into space
Vape life guaranteed to Grape Ape, head right
Call me late making moves as a 22
Plenty blues and whites
Grab a satchel for the night-sock game ankled, duct tape on the cable
Held my pants up, eyes unstable
Now I’m on cable, Sperry-tops never fit me right
Quarter-life crisis had me pissing on the floor at night
Fortified wine at the bottom of a quarter pipe
Mad dog foaming at the mouth for some cherry pie

[Chorus 1]
Should I take you home?
I'm hungry for the 4th of July
Fireworks burst in my minds eye
But my mind's still that of a child

[Verse 2]
She say she'd see me after one, I see you after two
Close the bar down, then I’m on a coup
Like a dove out the coop
And I'm flying mad high fever
Petroleum taste like nitrous tank in Iron Man
Watch me breathe, shuffle hard to the mirror
Breath on the window, myself the reflection
Bindi face, counting the red dot
Jaw twisting like a rain-soaked shoe box asking who's lost
Where's everybody? I'm alone counting on my fingertips
Ones that’s bought, Ones that’s sold
Girl keep calling now she bangin on my door
Wanna answer but this dick is feeling low

[Chorus 2]
Should I take you home?
Hungry for a piece of the pie
Fireworks lurk in the strychnine
And my mind's still that of a child

[Verse 3]
Pack my bags after midnight, looking to the moon
And the firefly constellation crush late June
With a crumpled pack of Camels and a tarnished coke spoon
Always thought I had potential more than most do
And I thought that I was grown too
But what to do about it
Hands shaking uncontrollable and nervous sounding
Residue under my cuticles hair’s falling out
Power’s been off three months so I do without it
Eating plaster chips hoping I might strike gold
Bird shit and pine cone, crack tooth on limestone
Sweat stain defines mind, I find time to head home
And old souls die hard in that troubled room

[Chorus 3]
Should I take you home?
I'm hungry for the 4th of July
When fireworks burst in my minds eye
Cause my mind was still that of a child
