[Verse 1]
Yeah we’re from the country baby
Where we get down and dirty
Turn it up for my kinfolks so I know they heard me
We raising hell let the bonfire smashed out
Sipping something stock
Got them leaning like their passed out
Now break their stash out
Change the whole vibe, slow motion
Toking on the purple passion cedar pine
Me and some friends of mine
Shit we do this all the time
For no reason, tis the season
Raise em up and feeling fine

[Chorus]
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up and drop baby, drop baby
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up, and drop drop drop drop
Kuntry folk, kuntry folk
Now spin it round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round

[Verse 2]
Now let me slow it down
Back to another level
I’ve been all about the bass
Yeah, I trained without the treble
So go and get your shovel
Cuz you’re gonna dig this
Kinda like that humpty dance
With a southern country twist
It starts off in your wrist
Poplock and swaggered out
It’s tight but dance
When it’s your chance you gotta brag about
Go on and drag it out
Out on the dancefloor
Put your cups up in the air
Break it down once more

[Chorus]
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up and drop baby, drop baby
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up, and drop drop drop drop
Kuntry folk, kuntry folk
Now spin it round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round

[Verse 3]
We’ll kick this off just right
And get it lit tonight
Just fill me up and pour me out
And get this party started
We’ll kick this off just right
And get it lit tonight
Just fill me up and pour me out
And get this party started
Let’s get it started like
Let’s get it started like
We’ll kick this off just right
And get it lit tonight
Just fill me up and pour me out
And get this party started

[Chorus]
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up and drop baby, drop baby
Kuntry folk come on get down
Now spin it round and round
Raise em up, raise em up, and drop drop drop drop
Kuntry folk, kuntry folk
Now spin it round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Spin it, spin it, round and round
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round
