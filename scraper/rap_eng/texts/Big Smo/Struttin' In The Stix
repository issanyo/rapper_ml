[Verse 1]
Back home they say the smaller the town
You know the sweeter the pine
I say the finer the women you know the quicker the shine
Goes bye bye now get it when the getting gets right
And pile up on the twelve pack of Bud Lite
Bonfire party with a dozen fine dimes
Sipping pappy’s moonshine now we talking good times
Get em shaking and bumping
Can’t fake it when they love it
Got to break em of something
And have the whole town running
You ain’t never seen gritty like a backwood hillbilly
Middle of the city slinging wood from an F-50
Straight hell-raising claiming that we amazing
We done did it like we did it
And we will do it again, come on

[Chorus]
You won’t find any city lights way back up in the woods (yeah)
We don’t need no neon signs telling us what’s good
So make your way out to our spot
Come and get your country fix
Where the girls are hot and the beer is cold
We’re struttin struttin struttin in the Stix
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 2]
Now when the getting gets to getting it
You got to get your done
So crank on up for some good ole fun
You might find yourself out in the middle of the Stix
Where I know some rednecks who be getting they fix
With some half dressed dimes dipping and spitting
On the tailgate sipping with the banjos picking
That ole outlaw country ain’t no city slickers
Go on fire up the grill with the cow, pig, chicken
Meat mud smothered with all the right fixings
And a cooler full of brew
That Pabst Blue Ribbon
We are who we are damn proud to admit
We them backwood hicks who be struttin in the Stix

[Chorus]
You won’t find any city lights way back up in the woods (yeah)
We don’t need no neon signs telling us what’s good
So make your way out to our spot
Come and get your country fix
Where the girls are hot and the beer is cold
We’re struttin struttin struttin in the Stix (hey, hey, hey)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Oh yeah
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix

[Bridge]
I want the music turned way up
So let all the tailgates down
Grab the cooler out of my truck and pass a solid all around
I like my beer on ice, my women fine
Somewhere I can’t be found
Put it all in the mix just to get out fix
We not partying in town because

[Chorus]
You won’t find any city lights way back up in the woods
We don’t need no neon signs telling us what’s good
So make your way out to our spot
Come and get your country fix
Where the girls are hot and the beer is cold
We’re struttin struttin struttin in the Stix (hey, hey, hey)
Come on, come on, come on
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix
Hell yeah we’re struttin in the Stix
Struttin in the Stix
