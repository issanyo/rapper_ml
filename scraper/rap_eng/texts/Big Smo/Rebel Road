[Verse 1]
You know it’s grind time
Rolling the pipeline
Chasing another dollar
I’m earning every dime
Mile after mile
My heart in every line
Stop after stop
Yeah I get it every time
I just got a call from down in Louisiana
Go on and fill me up
I’m bout to drop the hammer
I’m dodging every slammer
From Texas back down to Bama
Up to Tennessee to count the cabbage in my country cabin

[Chorus]
I’ll be on the road
Trying to catch another bite
With another load and I’m burning through the lights
Baby what a life, driving through the night
Living like a rebel on the road (road, road, road)

[Verse 2]
They call me big daddy
In damn near every city
I know the kind of women that love to get down and gritty
Lock lift loving while my gears are pumping
I top em old sauce, thinking mister what
I-24 down to South 65
Me tin truck with money on my mind
I’m on a double grind
Out here chasing dotted lines
Dodging d-o-g 'cause they’re trying to put me in a bind

[Chorus]
I’ll be on the road
Trying to catch another bite
With another load and I’m burning through the lights
Baby what a life, driving through the night
Living like a rebel on the road (road, road, road)

I’ll be on the road
Trying to catch another bite
With another load and I’m burning through the lights
Baby what a life, driving through the night
Living like a rebel on the road (road, road, road)

[Verse 3]
Breaker breaker 1 9 1 9
I’m rolling southbound with a big load of shine
I just passed a cowboy over on exit 5
Can you cover my back I’m going overdrive
Well 10-4 good buddy, I got your tail
If smokey comes a-running we gonna raise some hell
I can take him for a loop, clear your tracks
Don’t forget your boy when you come rolling back
Over and out

[Chorus]
I’ll be on the road
Trying to catch another bite
With another load and I’m burning through the lights
Baby what a life, driving through the night
Living like a rebel on the road (road, road, road)

I’ll be on the road
Trying to catch another bite
With another load and I’m burning through the lights
Baby what a life, driving through the night
Living like a rebel on the road (road, road, road)
