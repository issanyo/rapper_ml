[Chorus: Burgess]
If tomorrow I don't wake up
Don't you cry for me
Know I lived the life I dreamed of
Was everything that I could be
Man I made some damn good memories

[Verse 1: Smo]
Life has a funny way of plotting out your path
As a kid we all thrive to grow like the grass
Never looking back, welcome to another day
7 times a week, 365 ways
Year after year we all change like the season
Looking for our purpose and chasing every reasons
We find a meaning for who we're meant to be
Through music of our passion and creativity
To be free, that's the wind blowing through a field of hay
Focused on my mission, every day I will pray
Laying down my life, line after line
Just hoping you would listen while we still had the time

[Chorus: Burgess]
If tomorrow I don't wake up
Don't you cry for me
Know I lived the life I dreamed of
Was everything that I could be
Man I made some damn good memories

[Verse 2: Smo]
Well I meet my expectations, go on vacations
Stop to smell the flowers instead of hesitating
Stop procrastinating, turn off the PlayStation
Shut down the socials and do some meditating
Enough medicating, peeling back reality
Open up your mind, there's a whole fricking world to see
Let's start with you and me and get it face to face
Communication's key if we're ever gonna make it
I wanna celebrate the time that we have
I learned how quick it goes back when I lost my dad
He was all I ever had and for that I carry on
When you miss me rewind this song

[Chorus: Burgess]
If tomorrow I don't wake up
Don't you cry for me
Know I lived the life I dreamed of
Was everything that I could be
Know I wasn't always perfect
Yeah I broke a couple hearts
But liking back it all was worth it
'Cause it made us who we are
Yeah we made some damn good memories

[Verse 3: Smo]
Yo, you remember that one time
We was down at creek smoking
And dad come down there and caught us man
Well, he caught you, I was way too slick for that shit
But man I would never forget
You took the blame and the whooping on that one
Bro you always had my back man

[Chorus: Burgess]
If tomorrow I don't wake up
Don't you cry for me
Know I lived the life I dreamed of
Was everything that I could be
I Know I wasn't always perfect
Yeah I broke a couple hearts
But liking back it all was worth it
'Cause it made us who we are
Yeah we made some damn good memories
