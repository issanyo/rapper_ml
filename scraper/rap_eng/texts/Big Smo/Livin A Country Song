[Intro]
Oh you know I'm living every word of these songs
I swear heartbreak ain't got nothing on me
But you know it's rough when you live in a country song
Listen up now

[Verse 1]
And I grew up round the Chattahoochee
My mama tried but I was born to boogie
Wild and free stubborn in my ways
The only hell that she ever raised
Now me and my rowdy friends in low places
Tip up our solo cups and get wasted
Get a little more than mud on the tires
Where that corn grows past the barbed wire

[Chorus: Crowder]
Well life got hard for this simple man
When my girl ran off with my friend
Damn that's wrong
Feels like I'm living a country song
Yeah I work all day, I play all night
Till the sun comes up or the beer on ice
Is gone, feels like I'm living a country song

[Verse 2]
She came crawling right back from her sorted affairs
I said here's a quarter, call somebody who cares
'Cause I can die a happy man I'm alright with the way I am
Mr. misunderstood on a beautiful drug
High on heartbreak and strung outta love
Baby homegrown honey don't grow on trees
Real men love Jesus and Jesus loves me

[Chorus: Crowder]
Life got hard for this simple man
When my girl ran off with my friend
Damn that's wrong
Feels like I'm living a country song
Yeah I work all day, I play all night
Till the sun comes up or the beer on ice
Is gone, feels like I'm living a country song

A country song
A country song
Yeah a country song
Feels like I'm living a country song

[Bridge]
She got the money (Every penny)
And a tattoo (Right there on her back)
She tried to take the whole damn farm
And even my pontoon
She think she got the gold mine
And gave me the shaft (Come on judge)
But when it's all said and done
I'll be the one who's laughing last

[Chorus: Crowder]
I told you life got hard for this simple man
You know girl ran off with my friend
Damn that's wrong
Feels like I'm living a country song
Yeah I work all day, I play all night
Till the sun comes up or the beer on ice
Is gone, feels like I'm living a country song

A country song
A country song
Yeah a country song
Feels like I'm living a country song

A country song
A country song
Yeah a country song
Feels like I'm living a country song
