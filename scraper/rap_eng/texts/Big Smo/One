[Verse 1: Smo]
See in a world when you fall and sometimes get stuck
You have to rise to the moment and pick yourself up
Be a student and learn when life gets you down
And a teacher to show others how to turn it around
You can make 'em all proud when it's your time to shine
And go for the top when it's yours for the climb
We can do it together if that's what it takes
But having faith in yourself makes you one of the greats

[Chorus: Allen]
We are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break
We are one, we are one
We got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard
We are one, we are one
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa
We are one, one, one
We are one, one, one

[Verse 2: Smo]
The goal is always success and we're pushing for first
But not fighting it at all never quenches the thirst
There's a hunger inside and it's screaming for change
So give it your best when you're up at the plate
Swing baby swing and aim for the sky
No one's holding you back, if you want it just fly
This is your life so make it your dream
Together we are one, forever a team

[Chorus: Allen]
We are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break
We are one, we are one
We got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard
We are one, we are one
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa
We are one, one, one
We are one, one, one

We are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break
We are one, we are one
We got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard
We are one, we are one

We are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break
We are one, we are one
We got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard
We are one, we are one

We are strong, we are brave
We are one, we are one
We are one, we are one

We got hope, we got heart
We are one, we are one
We are one, we are one
