[Intro: Smo]
Hahahaha (Yeah)
Yeah this your boy Smyze (Big Smo)
With the Moonshine Bandits (Yeah)
We countin' that mud money baby
(Get it, get it, get it)
Stack it up

[Chorus: Smo]
We got trucks so high we can touch the sky
Get the planes out the way when we're ridin' by
We got mud money, I'm talkin' side-by-sides
Can-Am four wheelers with the four wheel drive
On the mud money, ladies dippin' down deep
I wanna see you covered from your head to your feet
Mud money, gonna put 'em in the bed
If you ain't about this life than you ain't about shit

[Verse 1: [?]]
High five God 'cause the lift kit tall
Better grab my ladder so your ass don't fall
Bottles in the yeti, got the hog in the pit
15's in the Chevy bumpin' outlaw shit
Side-by-sides sideways in the swamp
Yeah, from the mud to the plug, I've been known to rock shit
Off road cockpit, pile up and get it
Trails wide open, jacked up when we hit it
LEDs, stripper pole, middle of a mud hole
[?] ass bowties tangled in the tug rope
Pipes still spittin' with the 44's grippin'
Chasin' down my Jack with the Pabst Blue Ribbon
I'm just tryin' kick it, and sling a lot of muck
Meet a couple dirty girls that wanna get [?]
Turn the mud up, who's down for some shuckin'
Hold 'em back when the big trucks runnin'

[Break]
Yeah, the Moonshine Bandits
Big Smo
California to Tennessee
Yeah, whatcha gon' get that mud money
Let's go

[Verse 2: Smo]
Gas on the brush pile, throw a couple logs on it
Fire up the grill, I'ma throw a hole hog on it
Legs from the frog on it, I'm about to naw on it
Way to turnt, [?] they gonna call the law on us
[?] so strong it smell like paint thinner
A half a rack on, we gon' let the shrimp simmer
Dippin' down the river with the snorkel out the top
Sippin' at the high line where the girls are hot
Take it to the mud club off in the hollar
Yeah I'm in the backwoods where nobody follows
If you want it you oughta meet me off in the pit
With the Moonshine Bandits and the mud money shit
I'm rollin' with the kin folk, quickly comin' all this
Boiled up a couple hundred pounds of crawfish
Brisket in the smoker with the beans and all this
Corn fed, mud money bought all this

[Chorus: Smo]
We got trucks so high we can touch the sky
Get the planes out the way when we're ridin' by
We got mud money, I'm talkin' side-by-sides
Can-Am four wheelers with the four wheel drive
On the mud money, ladies dippin' down deep
I wanna see you covered from your head to your feet
Mud money, gonna put 'em in the bed
If you ain't about this life than you ain't about shit

[Outro]
Wh-wha-what up [?]
Shout out to [?]
Hey-hey 14's where you at
Where you at, where you at
(give it up)
What up to my
(Big Smo)
(Yeah)
This right here goes out to the redneck barbies
Wh-wha-wha-what about
[?]
Don't forget the mud hustlers
Ge-ge-ge-get that mud money
I see you out there snorkel deep
(Yeah)
That's what we've been drinkin' and smokin'
Ha-ha
