[Intro: Smo]
Yeah (Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh)
You know out here in Tennessee baby we keep long bumpy roads (Been a long, been a long bumpy road)
It ain't nothin' but a thang, let's go
(Whoa oh, whoa oh, it's been a long, it's been a long bumpy road)
I got my man Hosier bringin' me all the way up to Indiana baby
(It's been a long, it's been a long bumpy road)
Lets show 'em how we get down on these backroads (Whoa oh)
Come on

[Chorus: Hosier]
It's been a long bumpy road (Yeah)
Seen a lot of things on my ride (Come on)
Breakin' down slowly, sometimes overheatin'
Runnin' outta places to drive (You know we just)
I just keep movin' down the road with nowhere to go
Not a care on my mind (I don't care)
I got the windows rolled down with my beard in the breeze
I'm on E (Yeah), livin' every second up in my life
Every step of my life

[Verse 1: Smo]
Don't wake me up baby, hell I must be asleep
I'm in my K5 sittin' high, livin' the dream
And though the fame still the same it just ain't what it seems
I'd rather be back where I started, just me and my team
So while the time keep tickin', the mud keeps drippin'
Them pines still growin' and the 'shine they keep sippin'
All my true kinfolk still bumpin' "Country Livin'"
'Cause the music never dies once you let the fire kick in
Been a long bumpy road but I found my home
Between the kick and the snare, I know that's where I belong
Plus my pen and my pad they never steer me wrong
Just drop my life in a beat of a hip-hop song
And let the rhythm keep givin' me a reason to spit
About a simple southern life, hard times in the grit
The love and the pain, all the struggle and stress
That's the price you have to pay for my kind of success out on this

[Chorus: Hosier]
It's been a long bumpy road (Yeah)
Seen a lot of things on my ride (Come on)
Breakin' down slowly, sometimes overheatin'
Runnin' outta places to drive (You know we just)
I just keep movin' down the road with nowhere to go
Not a care on my mind (I don't care)
I got the windows rolled down with my beard in the breeze
I'm on E (Yeah), livin' every second up in my life (Hosier, Midwest Outlaws)
Every step of my life

[Verse 2: Hosier]
I'm in greatness with my beats on and a pen in my hand
United I stand, an Indiana man tryna make it out
Blood, sweat, and tears is what I put in, when I put work in
Dedicated to make it gotta make it save some
Been through the mud about 55 times, 56 times
Got up in drive and instantly I started shinin'
Bills are climbin', keep on rhymin'
That's gon' be my ticket out
I'd be a bitter fool to take a different route
I'm comin' out with a bang
Remember my name as one of the greatest
I ain't made it but I can taste it
I'm hungry and chasin' these dreams
That I'm makin' it's up for the takin'
I'm tired of waitin' I'ma be impatient here for the bacon
It's been a long ride
It's my time for gettin' sleeped on like I'ma park bench
Makes no sense but I refuse to give up everything I put in
Sacrifices that I made is for the future and what it brings
Pop a bottle of champagne and toast to our dreams

[Chorus: Hosier]
It's been a long bumpy road (Yeah)
Seen a lot of things on my ride (Come on)
Breakin' down slowly, sometimes overheatin'
Runnin' outta places to drive (You know we just)
I just keep movin' down the road with nowhere to go
Not a care on my mind (I don't care)
I got the windows rolled down with my beard in the breeze
I'm on E (Yeah), livin' every second up in my life
Every step of my life

[Verse 3: Hosier]
Drivin' up to the soul set with my speakers on crank, rollin' some dank
Sippin' some drank that I got up out my grandaddy's liquor cabinet
Settin' back reminiscin' about all the things that has happened
Smokin' up and we laughin' we all know it's about to happen
Just hungry and got it crackin' just give us the reins
We takin' over the game, I'm turned all the way up
Put your hands in the sky with me, if you feel me knockin'
Then let me in because I've been beggin' for a minute
I'm almost in it, yes, I'm in it for the win, and it's the beginnin'
Meanwhile I'm gonna live it up with my friends and my family
Entertainin' these fans with these bangers and keepin' 'em happy
Shout out to the fans, you like my fam
You make it happy, you makin' me happy
Witnessin' my dreams actually happenin'
I was told I wouldn't but when I do I'll humbly laugh at you
When I drive by and your neck break and I'm laid back
Thinkin' this is the life that I made, I'm finally famous

[Chorus: Hosier]
It's been a long bumpy road (Yeah)
Seen a lot of things on my ride (Come on)
Breakin' down slowly, sometimes overheatin'
Runnin' outta places to drive (You know we just)
I just keep movin' down the road with nowhere to go
Not a care on my mind (I don't care)
I got the windows rolled down with my beard in the breeze
I'm on E (Yeah), livin' every second up in my life
Every step of my life

[Outro: (Spoken)]
I won't give up, I refuse to
I don't have it in me to be a quitter
I wasn't built that way
I overcome and overpower every obstacle in my life
