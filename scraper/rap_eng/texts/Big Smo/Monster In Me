[Verse 1]
Now no one ever said that it was gonna be picture perfect
I had a decent past, my daddy never tried to hurt me
I wasn't a victim or a product of domestic pain
So what if I was bullied, pushedf around and sticked and stoned with names
They never broke my bones but I fell hard and got back up
And stitched myself together with these open mics and sampled cuts
I found the other me lurking underneath the stairs
Like another Jekyll that was Hyding in the kicks and shares
A combination of my blood mixed with sweat and tears
Was the potion that released the anger from my deepest fears
So flip the switch and push my buttons for a deadly ride
'Cause I've been looking for a reason to release the beast inside

[Chorus]
Come on if it's a fight you need
I'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream
If you wanna hear the sirens scream, well
Step up and meet the monster in me
Come on if it's a fight you need
I'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream
If you wanna hear the sirens scream, well
Step up and meet the monster in me

[Verse 2]
Don't try to figure me out, boy, you know that I'm crazy
Take my kindness for weakness and you'll be pushing up daisies
I hate lies and deceit like a thief in the night
I'm one hell of a problem when you cross me just right
In the full moon light better get your silver bullets
'Cause you know when I'm triggered then I'm fixing to pull it
Don't talk behind my back if you can't say it to my face
Like mistakes in my past I can have you erased
Hurt the ones that I love, I'll introduce you to pain
Get me off of my rocker, I'm going more than insane
So crawl up in your bed and hide under your sheets
I'll be the terror that takes you when you slip off to sleep

[Chorus]
Come on if it's a fight you need
I'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream
If you wanna hear the sirens scream, well
Step up and meet the monster in me
Come on if it's a fight you need
I'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream
If you wanna hear the sirens scream, well
Step up and meet the monster in me
