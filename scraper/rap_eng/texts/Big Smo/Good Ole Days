[Intro]
Boy Iâ€™m talking bout the throwback classic
I can get you there real quick
Come on
Hell, I remember when life was a lot easier
And time moved slow as molasses

[Verse 1]
Let's bring it back to the days
In the back of the class
Laughing and passing the grass
Chasing some ass
Talk trash and get smacked in a scrap
Man whatever happened to that
Before we had fancy cars and vacations
Before we had a flat screen or a Playstation
Now I'm getting older
Everything changed
Still I take a walk down memory lane
To the good ole days
I miss the good ole days

[Chorus]
Back when police used to know my name
Before I had bills and kids to raise
There ain't a damn thing that I would change nah hey
About them good ole days
If I would have known what I know right now
I would have pumped them brakes and slowed on down
I'd do anything to turn around
And go back to them good ole days
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back to the good ole days

[Verse 2]
Before social media
And the internet
We was rowdy as hell
But still innocent
Bumping Hip-Hop on cassette tapes
I would dream about being the next great
Out late on a date with my high school fling
Hit it wearing nothing but my high school ring
Never was the type to be the high school king
Looking back I wouldn't change a thing
About them good ole days
I love them good ole days

[Chorus]
Back when police used to know my name
Before I had bills and kids to raise
There ain't a damn thing that I would change, nah hey
About the good ole days
If I would have known what I know right now
I would have pumped them brakes and slowed on down
I'd do anything to turn around
And go back to them good ole days
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back to the good ole days

[Bridge]
I just want to go back
Take me back to the good ole days
I just want to go back
Take me back to the good ole days
I just want to go back
Take me back to the good ole days
I just want to go back
Take me back to the good ole days

[Chorus]
Back when police used to know my name
Before I had bills and kids to raise
There ain't a damn thing that I would change nah hey
About the good ole days
If I would have known what I know now
I would have pumped them brakes and slowed on down
I'd do anything to turn around
And go back to them good ole days
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Back back back to the good ole
Take me back to the good ole days
