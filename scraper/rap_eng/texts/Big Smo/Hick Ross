[Verse 1]
I'm southern by blood not relation
Survive with a buck knife and pawpaw's gun
One hit and you done, one sip and you spun
Big boss of the stix got 'em bumping at gums
'Bout this backwood country boy built Ford tough
Out the mid Tenn' mud where you might get stuck
Grand champ of my camp like a ten point buck
Let that 12 gauge spray if you fuck with my truck
I'm talking K5 Chevy, bonfire music
Meat mud smothered, better get used to it
Beast on the grill, I sizzle while I do it
If it's beef that you want bet you think you hear mooing
Now take it back to the facts
Redneck street cred, bloodline to match
Couldn't ride my boots, can't fit my hat
But since you on my coattails won't you scratch my back

[Chorus]
And holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise
They holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise

[Verse 2]
I got a dirt road hustle with a payday swagger
Sipping blue flame burning with some redneck jackers
Push pull wheels faster, dig down deeper
Off road rapper you can feel me through the speakers
Kinfolk love me, call me Big Smocephus
Teaching old shit grandaddy tried to teach us
How to skin a buck and run a trout line
The simple things that help a country boy to survive
I keep my eyes on the shine, a jar full of pine
A foot on the pedal, I get it there every time
I walk a line like Johnny, smoke 'em like Willie
Toast to the country folks, raise some hell if you feel me
Love me if you love me, fuck ya if you ain't with me
Just a good ole boy, backwood hillbilly
Jacked up boss truck, mud covered and shitty
Best believe, let's buy some bread and if you see me in the city

[Chorus]
Holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise
They holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise

They holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise
They holla Hick Ross
They call me the big boss
I'm known as that bad boy country boy
And they know who to call when they want that noise
