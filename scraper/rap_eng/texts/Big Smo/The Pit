[Verse 1: Demun Jones]
1999 with a 30 inch lift
53 inch tires, it was a Christmas gift
I ain't scared to get it dirty deep down in the mud
I let my buddy go first but his Jeep got stuck
I pulled him out in 2 wheel drive
Drop Jimmy low then the pit came alive
Yeah, a speed demon when I'm diggin'
Now everybody's duckin' 'cause I'm major mud slingin'
(D Jones) That's the games we play
Back off the main highway, neck deep in red clay
JC grade GA is where I stay
I see you boys next week, same time, same place

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
You got a ride you wanna show off, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got speakers that you wanna crank up, well okay
Make them subwoofers hit, subwoofers hit
You got a truck that's big and jacked up, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got a drink that you tryna turn up, well okay
Just take another sip, take another sip

[Verse 2: Demun Jones]
You ride stock, well that's okay
There's a diesel shop around the way, you can drop it off today
Lift it up, chip it up, off to the boondocks
Ridin' with the big dogs, muddy like them big hogs
Pick a channel, try to hit it goin' 50
Keep them windows down, the inside is gettin' filthy
Bass blastin' country rap through the system
If you lookin' for a city boy you just missed him
Way out here turbo keep it compressed
Cut straight pipes don't need DEF
Slingin' rooster tails high as a roof
'05 super duty and the engine's bulletproof

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
You got a ride you wanna show off, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got speakers that you wanna crank up, well okay
Make them subwoofers hit, subwoofers hit
You got a truck that's big and jacked up, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got a drink that you tryna turn up, well okay
Just take another sip, take another sip (D. Jones)

[Verse 3: Smo]
Yeah, I drop that Chevy in the pit, rippin' up the ground
Hear it rumble through the sticks like the bass in the sound
Bringin' them around one folk at a time
See me doin' me, watch a country boy shine
Like a jar full of pine, I twist your head back
That cedar pines squealin' too loud for a sac
Watchya know about that, ask your fam dadda
Tennessee down here, I'm the top shotta
Still kick it with my mama, she's my number one fan
Reminder of my daddy, that's a hell of a man
I got a hell of a plan, take over the country
Do it for my people I ain't worried 'bout the money
Keep my life muddy like my four wheel drive
And take another guzzle of that homemade 'shine
Raise them up to the sky (come on) if you're feelin' this shit
And if you don't we can fix ya, just meet me in the pits

[Chorus: Demun Jones]
You got a ride you wanna show off, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got speakers that you wanna crank up, well okay
Make them subwoofers hit, subwoofers hit
You got a truck that's big and jacked up, well okay
Just throw it in the pit (come on), throw it in the pit
You got a drink that you tryna turn up, well okay
Just take another sip, take another sip
