[Chorus]
You can run boy but you can’t hide from us
We gon find you
Gonna give it up ain’t no running from the country (repeat)

[Verse 1]
Big trucks loud pipes get em spinnin
Down home cooking that’s mamas fried chicken
Pops moonshine top shelf winning
Sweet southern dimes talkin pure country living
You can have your sunset on the boulevard
I’ll be front porch swinging looking over the yard
Put my four wheel drive against your fancy car
And in the mud I guarantee you won’t get too far
We don’t do champagne sippin’
It’s past blue rippin’ couple twelve packs
And the cooler just chilling
Keep your black tie dinner we be backyard grilling
Rolling through them woods where our races be ripping
Out here you don’t need no VIP
We kicking with our kin folk naturally
So pour another round
And make a toast
Cause we serving up country in our twelve past doors

[Chorus]
You can run boy but you can’t hide from us
We gon find you
Gonna give it up ain’t no running from the country (repeat)

[Verse 2]
From the bottom to the top
Top to the bottom ride around every corner
If you look you can spot em
They got mud on their truck on their jeans their boots
Put em in the crosshairs guarantee they’ll shoot
Grown deep from the roots
Southern by blood raised up to work hard
Taught right how to love
When push come to shove we be cream of the crop
Built from the ground up and we can’t be stopped
I let the tailgate drop and load em all up
Take me down the dirt road in the back of my truck
And we gonna get stuck
But don’t even trip
Lock the four wheel drive and let them 35’s grip
You gon feel it in your hips from your head to ya feet
So let the rhythm take control with this backwoods beat
Don’t fight it when it’s right
Cause you know it’s true
You can run from the country boy
But we gonna get you

[Chorus]
You can run boy but you can’t hide from us
We gon find you
Gonna give it up ain’t no running from the country (repeat)
