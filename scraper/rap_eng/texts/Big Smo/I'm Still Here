[Verse 1]
Now I grew up in a small town
Where all my family are still around
A little farm on a piece of land
And to this day, that's where I am
Like an old song with a different dance
My work shirt, old pair of pants
Last year's boots on next year's path
That dirt on my last tank of gas
I see my life and it looks the same
Kids grown but the love remains
Protect it all with a steady aim
Yeah some things just never change

[Chorus: Corey Crowder, Smo]
But I'm still here
Still singing bout trucks and beer
'Cause that's who I am
That's all I know
Still riding those rebel roads
Round here
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm still running from the same cops
Still see me round those same spots
I'm still here
With my pen and my pad
Reminiscing and so damn glad
I'm still here
I'm still raising 'em up
Back yonder where I's raised up
I'm still here

[Verse 2]
Friends from then are like family now
What we used to kick it is what we still brawl down
Some moved out but they came back around
And it's all good 'cause
I'm still here
With a cold beer and a backyard fire
We can pile up, get mud on tires
Kick back, relax where I plan to retire
And I hope it stays right here
Before it's too late but it's never gone
Yeah, made paths but you carry on
Just close your eyes when you hear this song
You'll see I'm still right here

And I'm still here
Still singing bout trucks and beer
'Cause that's who I am
That's all I know
Still riding those rebel roads
Round here

And I ain't going nowhere
I'm still running from the same cops
Still see me round those same spots
I'm still here

My pen and my pad
Reminiscing and so damn glad
I'm still here
I'm still raising 'em up
Back yonder where I was raised up
I'm still here

It don't matter where I'm at
I know where I hang my hat
Where I love and where I laugh
I'm still here, I'm still here
It don't matter where I'm at
I know where I hang my hat
Where I love and where I laugh
I'm still here, I'm still here

I'm still here
Still singing bout trucks and beer
'Cause that's who I am
That's all I know
Still riding those rebel roads
Round here

And I ain't going nowhere
I'm still running from the same cops
Still see me round those same spots
I'm still here

It don't matter where I'm at
In a small town
I'm still here
Where I love and where I laugh
With my family now
I'm still here

It don't matter where I'm at
What we all throw down
I'm still here
Where I love and where I laugh
Yeah I'm still here
