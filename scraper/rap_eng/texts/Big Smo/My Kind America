It’s my kind America

[Verse 1]
With my hand over my heart, eyes to the sky
Pledge my allegiance to the stars and the stripes
That's what I was taught before I even knew why
The American way is that why we fight
For our freedom
But what's the meaning if we don't try
Better get it all together or we're all gonna die
Terrorize our lives and we all gonna rise
One Nation under God with our guns on our side

[Chorus]
Maybe if we work a 'lil bit harder
We could get a 'lil bit farther
For our sons and daughters
My kind America
People, we can be our own leaders
And live a little bit freer
If we fight for
My kind America
It’s my kind America
My kind America
It’s my kind America

[Verse 2]
These presidential candidates looking like a buncha fakes
Line 'em all up and see if they got what it takes
To represent the people for us who saw the prequel
The last decade was controlled by the evil
With the man in charge and his global entourage
I coulda done a better job from my two car garage
So what's it gonna take, compassion state to state
Give me all the details and draft a mandate
I'll see it carried out
Can't you hear the children shout
Their future's looking dim
If we don't do something about it
For heaven's sake why we looking so afraid
Media fed minds
Man why we so blind, come on

[Chorus]
Maybe if we work a 'lil bit harder
We could get a 'lil bit farther
For our sons and daughters
My kind America
People, we can be our own leaders
And live a little bit freer, if we fight for
My kind America
It’s my kind America
My kind America
It’s my kind America

[Bridge]
Come on now brothers, yeah
Help out our sisters, yeah
Lean on each other
When we need a hand
Support our soldiers, yeah
They are the heroes, yeah
We are the people and together we stand

[Chorus]
Maybe if we work a 'lil bit harder
We could get a 'lil bit farther
For our sons and daughters
My kind America
People, we can be our own leaders
And live a little bit freer, if we fight for
My kind America
It’s my kind America
My kind America
It’s my kind America
It’s my kind America
It’s my kind America
