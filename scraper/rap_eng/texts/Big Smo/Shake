[Intro]
'Shyo boy Big Smo
With my man Tom G
From Tennessee and Florida baby
Make it shake

[Verse 1]
Yeah I been Ziploc popping since I was teenager
Independent hustle, still balling with the majors
Riding out the sticks on that dirt road coat
I came up from flipping bricks to rocking sold out shows
I get a back wood hood, redneck crazy
Camo tank top with them cut off daisys
It ain't nothing but a Smo thing baby
I keep that heat on my side if it's shady
Pile up in the Chevy, let me show you how to ride or die
Slop pit mama sipping on that apple pie shine
Rowdy mud nuggets in that four wheel drive
Cedar Pine kush got us sitting so damn high
The money don't stop so I'ma keep stacking
Dale Jr. can't call it checker flag flappin'
It ain't been the same since I stepped in the game
Set the country on fire and took over the lane

[Chorus]
Ain't no holding us down
We bring that country to your town
And make it shake
Country shake it, the country gang yeah yeah
Country bumping with my country gang
'Cause we've been on for so long
Put a life in every song
Make no mistake
Country boss, I got country song yeah yeah
Guess I drop a country song
Make no mistake, we make it shake

[Verse 2: Tom G]
Here's where I come in on it ain't no sitting to my table
You ain't bringing that in to it, what you rhyming for
Eat the check alive carnivor
Hear ye, hear ye, you got decrowned and I'm coming for it
It ain't my money then it's null and void
Straight out the country where we cash them big sheet pants and monies boy
Slap them things in the skilly with that good battle
It ain't about what you raise, all lives matter
Hope you hanging with my white partners in the mud pit
Hanging out on that slit smoke, liquor buzzing
Dirt bikes and four wheelers blunts and that good shit
We be throwing block parties, had the whole hood lit
I keep the off for the insects
We just a gang of wild boys bout having fun and getting chicks
And I forgot to mention getting sex
Bunch land around the house to go hunting, country living bless
While I'm still eating pig feet and chicken necks
Chitterlings, country family full of siblings
Country boys came to take over your city
Riding with a drink in the Chevy

[Chorus]
Ain't no holding us down
We bring that country to your town
And make it shake
Country shake it, the country gang yeah yeah
Country bumping with my country gang
'Cause we've been on for so long
Put a life in every song
Make no mistake
Country boss, I got country song yeah yeah
Guess I drop a country song
Make no mistake, we make it shake

[Hook]
Drop down, let me see how you do it
That back wood booty gon' make me lose it
Drop down, let me see how you do it
Show them boys how the country girls get to it
Drop down, let me see how you do it
Yeah that back wood booty gon' make me lose it
Drop down, let me see how you do it
Go and show them boys how the country girls get to it

[Chorus]
Ain't no holding us down
We bring that country to your town
And make it shake
Country shake it, the country gang yeah yeah
Country bumping with my country gang
'Cause we've been on for so long
Put a life in every song
Make no mistake
Country boss, I got country song yeah yeah
Guess I drop a country song
Make no mistake, we make it shake
