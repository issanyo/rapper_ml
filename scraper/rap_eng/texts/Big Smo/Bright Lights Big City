[Verse 1]
I come from a little town, not much around
One red light and a bunch of cows
Hay fields and corn rows
Creek beds by them dirt roads
But I been itching for a chance to grow
Stretch my legs and let it all go
Speed things up and get with the folk
Try something, this life is old
Got my bags packed, fat stacks
Brand new boots in a taxi cab
Driver take us where the party's at
There's a good time that's about to be had
Let these old boys about the box
Warm bottles popping, cold shots
VIP and no cops
Where the music's loud and the beat drops

[Chorus]
When we're in the bright lights, the big city
You best be ready to roll
'Cause we take the nightlife down to the nitty gritty
We vibing outta control
Let the music stand that place alive
And the dancefloor's getting extra vibey
The kinfolk coming to town
In the bright lights, the big city
You know we shutting it down

[Verse 2]
With me on Broadway all day
Bar hopping with no chase
Took gold cups no waste
Hit the green cross, we getting blazed
Meet me downtown, let's get crazy
Drove around like Miss Daisy
Stretch humble with a buncha ladies
Named Tina, Tiffany, Candy, Lacy
On the dancefloor keep it jumping
DJ keep it bumping
All night we don't stop
We gonna party like we gotta prove something
Pour 'em up, shoot 'em back
Blue ribbon yeah is on tap
She filling me up and I'm digging that
Take her back to the room that's where we at

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no, no
When we're in the bright lights, the big city
You best be ready to roll
'Cause we take the nightlife down to the nitty gritty
We vibing outta control
Let the music stand that place alive
And the dancefloor's getting extra vibey
The kinfolk coming to town
In the bright lights, the big city
You know we shutting it down

[Hook]
I said hey ladies
If you don't care
Put your hands up in the air
And fellas if you're jealous
You might wanna get the hell up out of here
Damn country boys now come to town
And it gets crazy when we around
Been on to turn the whole party out
So crank it up, it's going down

[Chorus]
When we're in the bright lights, the big city
You best be ready to roll
'Cause we take the nightlife down to the nitty gritty
We vibing outta control
Let the music stand that place alive
And the dancefloor's getting extra vibey
The kinfolk coming to town
In the bright lights, the big city
You know we shutting it down
