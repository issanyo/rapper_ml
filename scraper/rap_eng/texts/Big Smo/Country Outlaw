(Country) Yeah this your boy Smo
(Outlaw) Tennessee's number one country boy
(Alpha) That back boy and hustler from mid Ten

Yeah I'm a full time father and a stand up brother
Always been a problem and you can ask my mother
'Cause I came up on Hank and Cash, Beastie Boys came after that
DMC and NWA but Skynyrd always takes me back
To the dirt roads and river banks, handed down, still giving things
Home brew, old school, Chevy trucks down by the lake, now
Growing up and going hard, gambling with 16 bars
I know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, don't make me pull your card
It's too far to turn around, no point in going back
I'm laced up and knee deep like I'm puddling water on this track
Big John, Hick Ross, state to state, country boss
Dirty south hustler getting it in at any cost

'Cause I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood
You know that I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood

Country boy coming through, 300, 6 foot 2
Kicking mud, driving fast, I'm never last I thought you knew
Southern swag in my blood, moonshine in my sweat and tears
Scars go all across my heart from doing this for too many years
Got a [?] my pocket, on the other side is my '45 so
Don't make me cock it, I'll make this mud pit come alive
I'm riding home with these dirty hands, scuffed up boots and dirty pants
K5 on 35s, rolling like I don't give a damn
Give a hand to my kinfolk and let 'em know that it's ride or die
Face to face my enemies, they get it with me right outside the backyard
Parking lot, honky tonk or after spot
Hustle up your best herd, ten to one you ain't got a shot

'Cause I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood
You know that I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood

Yeah I'm that country boy
With the backwood flow
Living off the land
By the dirt road code
I be in the mud
Where my kinfolk go
Drop them tailgates
Then pile it up, let's roll

'Cause I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood
You know that I'm a country outlaw
Hustler, from the backwood
