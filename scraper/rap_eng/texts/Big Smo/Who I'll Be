[Chorus]
No matter where this road may go
No matter how far from my home
It's always there to let me know
Where I'm from and who I'll be
Who knows where this road may go
City lights from dusty roads
I don't give a damn who knows
That's where I'm from and who I'll be

[Verse 1]
The times getting shorter for the simple man
And the roads getting longer in this crowded van
And the sharpie stains on these busy hands
Remind me of a time when I dreamed for fans
Now they got me rolling toward the city light
The sold out shows on the weekday nights
All the hard work's how I paid the price
To reach my goals it took a lot of sacrifice
Putting in overtime at the kitchen paid
For the illest nights and the sleepless days
And it was all just to build us a better way
Where we could share a simple vision for a brighter day
Ain't nothing changed but the time of day
And the amount of hours that I don't have to play
But I just pray that I keep you all straight
Because this narrow road sure can be a busy lane

[Chorus]
No matter where this road may go
No matter how far from my home
It's always there to let me know
Where I'm from and who I'll be
Who knows where this road may go
City lights from dusty roads
I don't give a damn who knows
That's where I'm from and who I'll be

[Verse 2]
They gave me fancy clothes but I couldn't wear 'em
They pushed me fancy cars but I wouldn't caring
I'm still at wall mart buying underwear
Only difference now I buy a hundred pair
Favorite dickie work shirt that I love to wear
And they know me at the register I'm always there
Same barber shop still cuts my hair
Since my first album you can get my CD there
Now I'm on the road again like a willie song
I still can't believe pop's really gone
And he ain't here to see everything that's going on
But I know he'd be proud looking down like boy your on
Your family got your back so you're free to roam
Your gal got your kids holding down your home
Never look back show them what you know
I taught you how to be a man show them where to go

[Chorus]
No matter where this road may go
No matter how far from my home
It's always there to let me know
Where I'm from and who I'll be
Who knows where this road may go
City lights from dusty roads
I don't give a damn who knows
That's where I'm from and who I'll be
