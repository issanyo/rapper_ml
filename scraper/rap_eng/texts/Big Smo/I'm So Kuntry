[Intro]
Yeah we bout to take you down that old backroad
Welcome to the country baby
Yeah
Show 'em how we get down out here
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I'm so country baby
I like everything smothered in southern gravy
Backwood home grown and a little crazy
Laid out by the water under something shady
Ain't nothing less baby
We like our roads dirty, rolling in my K5
Eating deer jerky, sipping on a jar of pine
Spotting wild turkey, cedar pine in my swisher
Got me feeling blurry but I don't think they heard me
I said we outta sight back in the holler
Underneath the moonlight, you looking for a whooping
You can get a good fight, you can find your way home
You'll be alright, you might be alright

[Chorus]
I'm so country baby
I'll tell the boys
Come along [?]
I'm so country baby
Take them backroads
You might wanna bring your [?]
I'm so country baby
Got me a tractor
4 wheeler rolling back
I'm so country baby
Like you ever seen a country boy
So damn crazy

[Verse 2]
Yeah these overnight country boys heard what I said
They can ten gallon hats on their half gallon heads
Claiming to be me in a New York minute
Couldn't hit the broad side of a barn standing in it
I run 'em like a hound, beat 'em with a switch
I shove them boys down, better pull 'em out the ditch
Let me hit 'em with them backwood nuke sick sound
Redneck, white tee, blue tick hound
I'm in my K5 watching for the K9
Traffic in that country boy swag cross the state line
Running moonshine, got the truck bed full
Old lean boy and a pit bull
Big cup of shine, big stick of pine
Grown man status welcome to my state of mind
Get out my rowdy friends at the drop of a dime
Meet me in the country boy best believe we do it fine

[Chorus]
I'm so country baby
I'll tell the boys
Come along [?]
I'm so country baby
Take them backroads
You might wanna bring your [?]
I'm so country baby
Got me a tractor
4 wheeler rolling back
I'm so country baby
Like you ever seen a country boy
So damn crazy

I'm so country baby
I'm so country baby
I said I'm so country baby
I'm so country baby
I'm so country baby
D'you know I'm so country baby
I said I'm so country baby
I'm so country baby
