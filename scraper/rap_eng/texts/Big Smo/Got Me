[Big Smo]
A little Bocephus
A lot of Jack Daniels
Little bit of Jesus
Whole lot of scandals
Living in a hick town
Lot of growing my own
Southern fried chicken
Leaving nothing but a clean bone
Sucking down suds and sipping on moonshine
Locking in the hubs
Slang mud for a good time
Ain't going down till the sun comes up
Didn't know if you know, if you didn't guess what

[Chorus]
That's what you got, that's what you got girl
That's what you got when you got me
That's who I am that's who I am
As a man I don't know how to not be
All i want to do is rock you like you rock me
That's what you got that's what you got girl when you got me


[Verse - Big Smo]
You riding shotgun
Subs in the back seat
Rattling windows
Rolling down main street
Getting off the grid
Where the KC's pay off
Cutting through the dark
To the barn with the hay loft
Laying you down
And giving you my word
Boys are my boys but baby you come first
Doing you right like no other can do
Having your back for a rebel with a tattoo

[Chorus x4]
That's what you got, that's what you got girl
That's what you got when you got me
That's who I am that's who I am
As a man I don't know how to not be
All i want to do is rock you like you rock me
That's what you got that's what you got girl when you got me
