[Chorus]
My American Pride, bring it all the way home
With my gun on my side cocked and loaded I'm ready to roll
Together we ride, wherever we roll
Put it all on the line, only way that we know
Yeah this is our time, so we ready to go
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home


[Verse 1]
This from my whole team
All the people that know me
You're going to have to show me
Like you owe me for the whole thing
I see that you showed up
And clearly the rest of emâ€™ froze up
So when it goes down then killer be killer
We know which one needs to get rolled up
So pile in baby
Let's make them go crazy
You can just follow me into the flames
So be the angel that saves me
Y'all bringing it home
Back where it belongs
And let it fly high, way up in the sky, forever be known as our own


[Chorus]
American Pride, bring it all the way home
With my gun on my side cocked and loaded I'm ready to roll
Together we ride wherever we roll
Put it all on the line, only way that we know
Yeah this is our time, so we ready to go
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home

[Verse 2]
Let this be the anthem when you stand up, put your hands up
Yeah they wanna ban us they can stand us reprimand us
Keep pushing the line
And you gonna find
The part of my heart that has no remorse for anything that is in mind
I'm telling you now, you swim and you drown
No one on the ground is just you
No Twitter account, no money amount
No matter the cost, you pay dues
When it comes your time, you'll have to decide
What's in for the ride, and you choose
To finish the race, you wanted first place, so you gotta do what you do


[Chorus]
American Pride, bring it all the way home
With my gun on my side cocked and loaded I'm ready to roll
Together we ride wherever we roll
Put it all on the line, only way that we know
Yeah this is our time, so we ready to go
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home
We're bringing it home

[Outro]
If there's ever been anything worth standing for
It's standing up for what you believe in
Let's go!

Hey!
