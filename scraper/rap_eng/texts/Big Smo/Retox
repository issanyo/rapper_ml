[Intro]
Bartender pour us another round over here let’s get this party restarted
That’s right keep em coming baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah I can feel the sunlight creeping through my window
Last night left me laying on my floor
Who’s that sleeping in my bed though
It must been the last girl that said hello
Headed to the fridge when my feet hit the ground
I got a hangover that I’m trying to shutdown
Two shots of whiskey and a cold beer to pound
Then it’s back to the bar we ready for another round

[Chrous]
Cause we went heavy last night with the beer and the shots
We started up again before the day gets hot
Don’t even need to look at the clock cause you know it don’t stop to it’s time to retox
Keep it going with the helmet dome better bring your bloody mary to start it off
Saddle up and get back on the socks cause you know it don’t stop it’s time to retox

[Verse 2]
Hey don’t leave us hanging over here we’ll take a couple more nice and cold
Now we’re drinking margaritas and pitchers of sangria
Singapore slang with tequila on the side
Hurricane’s got my brain
Lost on the concept of space and time
But we’re still going yeah the party still growing
We just living for the moment while we in our prime
Cause you only live once so we chalk it all up in a bottomless cup from morning to night

[Chorus]
Cause we went heavy last night with the beer and the shots
We started up again before the day gets hot
Don’t even need to look at the clock cause you know it don’t stop to it’s time to retox
Keep it going with the helmet dome better bring your bloody mary to start it off
Saddle up and get back on the socks cause you know it don’t stop it’s time to retox

[Verse 3]
Aw yeah we feeling it now oh look out here it comes
You know it’s Mr. Wild and free yeah that’s me
And the party don’t stop I can guarantee
From sunup to last call the whole spots on fleek
A celebration in the making so call all your peeps
I drink one for breakfast two for brunch three or four more when it’ time for lunch
My whole crew gets turnt when I walk in the room
And the ladies go crazy when the bass goes boom

[Chorus]
Cause we went heavy last night with the beer and the shots
We started up again before the day gets hot
Don’t even need to look at the clock cause you know it don’t stop to it’s time to retox
Keep it going with the helmet dome better bring your bloody mary to start it off
Saddle up and get back on the socks cause you know it don’t stop it’s time to retox

[Outro]
Aw yeah
You know how we party baby
Cause you know it don’t stop it’s time to retox
From sunup to sunup we gonna get this party restarted
