[Verse 1]
Hey, It's a party over here bring your people to the other side
Take them back roads you might wanna bring your other ride
Big chrome wheels, custom paint that ain't cutting it
Knobbys with mud flaps we be on some other shit
Couple hundred cattle and a pond full of southern cat
You can't tell me nothing 'bout bar-b-que and both of that
Meet me in the middle T and show you how we krump it up
Hang it in the barn let it cure 'til that proper stuff
Chattanooga shine got me feeling like Super Smo
Take another shot hit the bourbon now we super blowed
I'll be in the chicken coop whose going chicken hunting'
Catch me on Youtube if ya wanna learn ya something
Bout this simple southern country boy outta Tennessee
Hit me up on Myspace if ya wanna get at me
Right around the corner there's a perfect place for you an me
We all call it home but you can call it Tennessee

[Chorus]
Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee

Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Now if ya can't shoot it, race it, sleep wit it, or eat it
Down here in middle Tennessee ya just don't need it
Rabbit trap in one 12 gauge in the other hand
And if ya don't love this country boy find another, Man
Need me a Mid Tenn thoroughbred chick
That can eat a Granny Smith apple through a picket fence
Maybe dream about it won't quit for days
She's fine as a frog hair split four ways
Fresh cut like a hay field know what I mean?
Have you ever seen a country boy so damn clean
John Deere tractor four wheeler or a backhoe
Workin' on the farm or rollin' down a back-road
Looking for a country gal with a lot 'a street smarts
Spend a couple thousand of my money down at Wal-Mart
Thick legged, thick booty sweet like tea
Baby girl lets go carve our initials in a tree

[Chorus]
Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee

Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee

[Verse 3]
Big ass white boy boss of the dirt roads
Fruit, wine, and sticky I can get it by the truckload
Sippin' on fire water smokin' on a hog leg
Rubbin' on a southern belle chewin' on a frog leg
'Bout a hundred youngins at the Bar-b-que at noontime
After the sun sets it's straight to the moonshine
Single barrel shot a fishin' pole and a coon hound
Capable of turnin' any city to a boom town
So Tennessee ain't the type that ya love to hate
Slick as goat spit tough as a two dollar pig steak
Dogs on the porch coveralls on the clothes line
I be takin' care of things tell me when it's go time
Better come correct when you step on my grass
Let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash
Round up a hundred honkies with just one whistle
With a buzz like that I don't even need a pistol

[Chorus]
Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee

Rollin' on them back roads blowin' pine
Sipping on that moonshine all the time
Party in the backyard your's or mine
(Hey)
Either way we just kickin' it in Tennessee
