This is for the 4 wheel Mud nut
Jacked up Chevy truck
Rollin in Ford tough
Creepin through them deep ruts
Music cranked full speed
Moonshine fresh tree
Look they keg standin'
On the roof of that SUV
Trail ride slip n' slide
In my side by side
Rippin like a RAZR
Through a roll of Tennessee pines
Hangin by the lake
The bon fire bound to make
All them country gals go crazy
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin' guess what
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin'
Kick mud
All my lil' mud nuggets
Gettin buck at the ball
Tell them city boys to
Kick mud off of the bar
Raisin Cain in the lane
3 foot of slop
And the machine it don't listen
When you tell it to stop
True mud camo
And some dirty jeans
Meat mud smothered
Yeah I put that on everything
Cotton mouth
Boots Farmall hat
Now tell me that you ever see
Country like that
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin' guess what
Kick mud
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin' then you can
Kick mud
Its Big John on the block
Better live ya life savin's off an acre a crop
You all talk it
I walk every line that I spit
Keep it kuntry for my kinfolk reppin' the stix
Backwoods livin' produce flippin'
Pure bread American
Southern and simple
We're born to ride
Livin' to die
Nothin standin' in our way
When we're sittin' this high
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin' guess what
Kick mud
35's sittin high my truck'll
Kick mud
Crawlin through them slop pits my grips
Kick mud
Country livin' shine sippin' we all
Kick mud
If you don't like the way we livin' then you can
Kick mud
