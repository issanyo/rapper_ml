[Chorus]
You wanna smoke then smoke
You wanna drink, drink another
You wanna raise hell in a back wood field
With your redneck brothers
Well some do it for what they love
Others did it for uncle Sam
We do it for us
We do it 'cause we can
We do it 'cause we can

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't raise no fool, we did the best we could
For a little farmhouse out there on the edge of the wood
Our daddy served us proud, red white and blue
And if he was here today he'd tell you too

[Chorus]
Son, you wanna smoke then smoke
You wanna drink, drink another
You wanna raise hell in a back wood field
With your redneck brother
Well some do it for what they love
Me I did it for uncle Sam
I did it for us
We do it 'cause we can
We do it 'cause we can

[Verse 2]
You know I always kneel for God and stand up for America
'Cause all lives matter in the eyes of a terrorist
The storm is coming got us running for the hills
They overprice our water while we drowning in our bills
I clock in for the thrill of a better tomorrow
While the media has us looking through the eyes of the sorrow
The world is getting hollow, still waiting on a change
Till then keep doing your thing

[Chorus]
You wanna smoke then smoke
You wanna drink, drink another
You wanna raise hell in a back wood field
With your redneck brothers
Well some do it for what they love
Others did it for uncle Sam
We do it for us
We do it 'cause we can
We do it 'cause we can

You wanna smoke then smoke
You wanna drink, drink another
You wanna raise hell in a back wood field
With your redneck brothers
My kinfolk, they do it for life
My heroes still do it for uncle Sam
We do it for us
We do it 'cause we can
We do it 'cause we can
