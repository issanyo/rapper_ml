[Intro]
Yeah
It's your mans Big Smo
Hey You Feddy
What up dog
Welcome to the struggle
I'm here man
Just another day another dollar
Yeah
Tryin' make em holla
Make em holla
Let's go Smo

[Verse 1: Smo]
I woke up this morning looking for a better way
With three kids a wife and a job with only half the pay
That it'll take for me to make it another day
Struggling to do the simple things that I say
Like food for our stomach lights and water for a wash and shave
Got me feelin' like I'm digging myself deeper in my grave
I'm gonna break I know this ain't my fate
God's watching over me but it sees shady in my space
You can look in my face I'll turn it all around
Trying to reach it to the top but I can't get my feet up off the ground
It holds me down i'm caught up in the struggle
It paralyzed my life like I can't even move a muscle
I try to hustle but the block so cold a young brother can't win
Trying get it on his own I need help I can't do this all alone
I want to call home but I can't even use my phone

[Chorus: Smo and Feddy]
Welcome to the struggle
It's just everyday life
Trying to keep my head up to the sky
Another day another dollar
I'm just trying to make em holla
Yeah welcome to my world
I'm just trying to live my life
And feed my baby girls
It's one foot in front of the other
Trying to help each other while we living in the struggle

[Verse 2: Feddy]
Struggling everyday to keep food on my families plate
I got three kids and a wife and more bills than I can pay
A life so hard has turned the brown hair on my face gray
Wondering day by day if I'm gonna have a place to stay
I've been forced on third-shift and they cuttin' my pay
Just so my manager can get a Christmas bonus today
We got people on the street with no place to stay
They lost their jobs and there life looks very gray
You know I've lost all hope in our government today
They spending money that they know we can't pay
Thanks Uncle Sam you make every day a rainy day
There's no time for play in the studio everyday
I'm chasing this dream that won't go away
Listening to my kids saying “Daddy can we get some candy today”
Sorry kids daddy's got no money my pockets looking funny
Lookin' to the sky tears fill my eyes as I pray to god
Please help me with my life all I got in this world is my kids and wife
And this broke down dream to make something of my life

[Chorus]
Welcome to the struggle
It's just everyday life
Trying to keep my head up to the sky
Another day another dollar
I'm just trying to make em holla
Yeah welcome to my world
I'm just trying to live my life
And feed my baby girls
It's one foot in front of the other
Trying to help each other while we living in the struggle

[Outro]
Welcome to my struggle
Welcome to my struggle
Welcome to my struggle
Welcome to my struggle
Welcome to my struggle
A life so hard I could barley move a muscle
