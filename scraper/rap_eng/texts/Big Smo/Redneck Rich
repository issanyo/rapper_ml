I got a heart of gold with a back woods soul
A dream to own a lot more than I owe
A few heavy bills is weighin' me down
And I'm doin' what I can just to wait them out
With a hard weeks pay from a full time shift
We might clock out but we never quit
Got a couple great kids that keep me right
And a sweet southern gal to hold tight at night

[Chorus]
I got a glass bottomed boat and a four wheel drive
John Deere mower and a side by side
I always got somethin' hooked up to my hitch
Yeah I'm redneck rich
I got a pond full of fish field full of corn
Hell of a view from my back porch
And I own everything inside my fence
Yeah I'm redneck rich

I got an old glass jar full of last year's change
Toilet seat trophy from the redneck games
The King of my castle, boss of my time
And there's still some things you know money can't buy
Like that gravel drive off an old back road
That takes me down to my home sweet home
Shack in the back, pig in the pit
Keg of Blue Ribbon for my folks to get lit

[Chorus]
I got a glass bottomed boat and a four wheel drive
John Deere mower and a side by side
I always got somethin' hooked up to my hitch
Yeah I'm redneck rich
I got a pond full of fish field full of corn
Hell of a view from my back porch
And I own everything inside my fence
Yeah I'm redneck rich

[Bridge]
Well I picked it up from my old man
Son ya gotta be tough when times get bad
Bet your ass that I'll survive
With my shotgun, rifle, and my 45

[Chorus]
I got a glass bottomed boat and a four wheel drive
John Deere mower and a side by side
I always got somethin' hooked up to my hitch
Yeah I'm redneck rich
I got a pond full of fish field full of corn
Hell of a view from my back porch
And I own everything inside my fence
Yeah I'm redneck rich
