[Intro: Smo]
Little song I wrote about my journey through life
From being a kid collecting coins
Being a young man making a living
And growing up staying on that grind one step at a time baby
Y’all take a walk with me

[Verse 1: Smo]
I remember finding my first penny on heads
And wishing for the finer things in life as a kid
Like G.I. Joes and grape snow cones
Baseball cards and ceiling stars that glow
So I got an old jar from a masons box
I wrote my name on the front and poked a slot in the top
And dropped in that first penny watched it rattle around
And everywhere that I went I kept my eyes to the ground
For a nickel dime dollar working for my papa
Farm chores paid more as it got hotter
Either bush hoggin’ the field or haulin’ some hay
I would weed the whole garden for a full day’s pay
And my daddy taught me that if you earned your way
It will mean more to you when you spend it some day
Keep saving up your change
Never throw it away
Fill your jar to the top and put it somewhere safe
Welcome to

[Chorus: CB3]
My life in a jar
It sure has takin’ me so far
From the coins I collected to the grains we selected
To the plants out behind the barn
It’s my life in a jar

[Verse 2: Smo]
Now as I got older my method got colder
My skills had developed to a full time roller
Driving state to state and line to line
With a trunk full of Uncle Dave’s best moonshine
It was that white lighting that blue flame burner
The best out the sticks with a smooth southern flavor
No chaser a high speed racer
Country boy running from them ATF Agents
Back roads kickin’ up dust like a chicken fight
Navigate the sunset to keep me out the city lights
Spare tank of gas I can run 'em on E
Blue lights and sirens would never stop me
No trace tint with no plates
I was out like a light hit my destination safe
It’s just another day an outlaw in a car
Tryin’ to double up these dollars fillin’ up these jars
This is just

[Chorus: CB3]
My life in a jar
It sure has takin’ me so far
From the coins I collected to the grains we selected
To the plants out behind the barn
It’s my life in a jar

[Verse 3: Smo]
Now the coins pile to cash but so did the grain
And all this rippin’ and runnin’ was driving me insane
The times have changed and so did the game
It was too much risk driving state to state
Plus the soil was as rich as our aspirations
Got the right seeds and started cultivating
Patiently waiting with daily preparation
And inch by inch we would reach out destination
Twelve feet tall like a cedar bush
Sweet skunk crossbread with that O.G. Kush
It was prime to push and the block was right
And once again we filled the jars and put the lids on tight
We was ground shipping through them big brown trucks
And we knew that it was risky but we pushed our luck
Boxed and ducted sealed with a secret touch
I put my life in these jars just to earn a buck
I keep living

[Chorus: CB3]
My life in a jar
[Smo]Simple life baby
It sure has takin me so far
[Smo]Knee high to a grass hoper to a grown man
From the coins I collected to the grains we selected
To the plants out behind the barn
It’s my life in a jar

[Outro: CB3]
Yeah that’s right just collecting money as a kid
Earning a dollar as a teenager
And trying to start a business as a grown man
You can mix all that tall up and put it in a good old mason jar
And that’s my life baby
One step at a time year after year
