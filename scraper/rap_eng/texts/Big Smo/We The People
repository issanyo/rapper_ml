[Verse 1: Smo]
America, what are we doin'
How did we ruin
The life and the liberty we are pursuing
Let's get it movin'
Start introducin'
A change in our nation
It's time for improvin'
What has it come to
What have we done to
Our country
And what it's been run through
The Government Mobs
They thinkin' they gods
They takin' our jobs
And wanting our guns too
Taxes for our actions
Police with badges harassing in classes
ISIS tryin' to burn us to ashes
And health care don't even cover our asses
I'm asking for direction
How do we change the leaders ain't reppin'
Draggin' us into the debt that they stepped in
Keepin' our voices from being our weapons

[Chorus: Beathard]
Where are we the people
When did we go silent
So much for all that dying
For the land of the free
I think of our forefathers
Treading cross that water
Wonder if they'd even bother
If they knew this is how it would be

[Verse 2: Smo]
We're changing the plan
Step up to the man
The rich and the poor
It's time that we stand
Together, we can do better
Replacin' the races
We're birds of a feather
Find a solution
Revolution
Media burning the flag we're salutin'
Step in the booth and
Remember our roots when
Presidents used to lace up their boots
And rolled up their sleeves
They'd fight and they'd bleed
For we the people
And all we believed
Let's replant the seeds
Of Freedom of Speech
To say and to share
And keep privacy free
For troops on the ground who fought
And they vowed for all of our cities
And every small town
The heroes we lost
And the ones with us now
Let's give them a home
Where they all can be proud

[Chorus: Beathard]
Where are we the people
When did we go silent
So much for all that dying
For the land of the free
I think of our forefathers
Treading cross that water
Wonder if they'd even bother
If they knew this is how

[Outro: Smo]
We are the people
We are the sons and daughters
The ones that our forefathers
Were counting on to carry on
The dreams that they were dreaming
The fight like hell
Allegiance
To the stars, the stripes and the freedom
To the believin'
In one nation under God
