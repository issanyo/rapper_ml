[Verse 1]
Here we go
Country folk got it right
You know they say
In the bitter sweet land of the milk and honey
You can’t buy love but it will take your money
Uncle Sam can’t count but he ain’t no dummy
The powers that be can learn something from me
Jesus is Lord, cash is king
When it rains, it pours,the poor boys will treat
Gotta treat old folks like you’re gonna be one
And love your neighbor like you’re gonna need one
We fly our flag at the price of freedom high

[Chorus]
Out of all the ways there is to live this life
Out of all the ways there is to live this life (tell me about it)
I think the rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
I think the rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
(I believe you onto something right there)
Rednecks got it right

[Verse 2]
I done learned when the going gets tough, the tough push through it
We ain’t afraid to say it and then we stick to it
We may be simple but believe we ain’t stupid
If you want it done right, let a country boy do it
Yeah we might get loud all up in your face
Probably raise a bunch of hell all up in your place
I know I’ve done some things that I can’t erase
Come Sunday morning, I’m all about that grace
Spread my wings and let that free bird fly

[Chorus]
Out of all the ways there is to live this life (yeah you only get one shot)
Out of all the ways there is to live this life (you better make it count)
I think the rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
I think the rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
(just squeeze and shoot)

[Bridge]
You know we’re here for the long haul
Why can’t we all get along y’all
It ain’t left or right  no we ain’t gotta fight
It’s right or wrong y’all
I’m gonna raise my flag so high
I’m gonna spread my wings and fly

[Outro]
Out of all the ways there is to live this life
Yeah the rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
The rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
The rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
The rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
The rednecks got it right (right, right, right)
