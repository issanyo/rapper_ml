[Verse 1]
Ow it was just another Friday night
I thought I'd take a drive and maybe catch me a bite
And I knew a little spot down a couple of lights
Where the music was low and the mood was just right
So I slid into a corner booth
Ordered up a sweet tea appetizer for two
You was checking me out and I was looking at you
I decided to ease over and talk for a few
Now I'm not usually the type to be out at a bar
Cause the late night scene seems to go too far
And I used to be the type to go way too hard
But here I am and baby, there you are

[Chorus]
Now I could be wrong
Might be right
I never have believed in love at first sight
But I know I'm crazy over you (crazy over you)
It's the way you look
The way you move
The way I feel from across the room
Now tell me, tell me it ain't true
I think I got a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now I can't believe in this small town
Where we both growed up
That it took this long for us to both show up
And who would have known that over a couple of cups
In so little time we’d both learn so much
And you know how these rooms here can talk
Everybody's in this bar watching us like a hawk
And if it's too much for you to handle
I could just take a walk
'Cause I'm sure you got a man
And I don't want to get you caught
But if not, you can just roll with me
Hell I'm parked right outside in that SUV
It's funny times like this I just can't believe
Something so accidental is so meant to be

[Chorus]
Now I could be wrong
Might be right
I never have believed in love at first sight
But I know I'm crazy over you (crazy over you)
It's the way you look
The way you move
The way I feel from across the room
Now tell me, tell me it ain't true
I think I got a thing for you

[Bridge]
You can call it love
You can call it lust
I never was sure of what it was
All I knew it took me by surprise, yeah
From the first hello
To the last goodbye
Whenever I'm with you
Feels like I'm losing my mind
I know I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you
(I’ve got a thing for you)

[Chorus]
Now I could be wrong
Might be right
I never have believed in love at first sight
But I know I'm crazy over you (crazy over you)
It's the way you look
The way you move
The way I feel from across the room
Now tell me, tell me it ain't true
I think I got a thing for you
