[Intro]
Yeahh
It's your mans big Smo
Ayy yo Jelly Lil Wyte lets tell em how it is

[Chorus: Big Smo]
I'm just a kuntry boy (just a kuntry boy)
Livin' out on a farm (you know we out on a farm)
I got pounds on the other side of town with the crop in the barn (I can smell it all the way over here)
Just sipping on shine (you know we sipping on shine)
Sipping straight from the jar (drinking straight from the jar)
Law dogs is a hunting us down 'cause they know who we are (yeah they know who we are)

[Verse 1: Big Smo]
Yeah see we some Tennessee kuntry boys it don`t get no better man
We back road moonshine sippin' in my Chevrolet
Blowin' on that killer hay hoping i can smoke away
Every single problem from the day
I won`t ever change southern by blood in the mud in the USA
Home grown southern swag yup that`s the way I was raised
Hustling to get my pay moving kush state to state
Dodging johnny law cause they trying to give me 5 to 8 underneath the jail in a cell but they way too late
Cause I'm long gone out of sight time to celebrate
Touch down with my fam outta town collaborate
Smo and Lil Wyte N Jelly good ole boy heavyweights
Pushing to the limit in this game of life that we play
Represent what we stand for in a major way
Outlaws living on the edge of an open grave
Raise your glasses to the sky
And keep it kuntry everyday

Hook: (Big Smo)
I`m just a kuntry boy (yeah)
Living out on a farm (32 acres baby count 'em)
I got pounds on the other side of town with the crop in the barn (sure does smell good out here)
Just sipping on shine (best of the best Jelly Roll)
Sipping straight from the jar (tell em Jelly Big Smo you know what it is)
Law dogs is a hunting us down 'cause they know who we are (yeah they know who we are)

[Verse 2 Jelly Roll]
This for them kuntry boys them outlaws and hole in the walls
Lil Wyte calm down you can`t drink moonshine through a straw
Yeah they call me Jelly Roll hooked up with my partner Smo
Ever since that hate goes on record labels call my phone
See I wake up every morning and try to find a bag
But before I eat breakfast got to pop a couple tabs
I still keep it kuntry like a big green tractor
I'm sick of these mini me`s just call me fat bastard
No reception in the house call me on my home phone
This dro is that good but its not that cali it's that homegrown
I ain't even tripping girl I ain't actin hard
Start a fight with my ex then get kicked out of the bar
Man I cannot find my car party wheres the cigar
I forgot what I was rappin' 'bout I'm higher than a star
I ain't saying that I'm good I ain't saying that I'm pimpin'
I'm just saying I'm like Tiger Woods FORE

[Chorus]
I`m just a kuntry boy living out on a farm (yeah)
I got pounds on the other side of town with the crop in the barn (sho do I swear to god he do)
Just sipping on shine (aww yeah)
Sipping straight from the jar (straight from the jar baby)
Law dogs is a hunting us down cause they know who we are (they ain't going find me though this yo boy Lil Wyte lets go)

[Verse 3: Lil Wyte]
There ain't a day past that I ain't into somethin' from the sticks
To tha hoods they say that honky is bumpin
From Unionville to Manchester all the way to Cashville
I'm the original good ol' boy I says let the cash spill
Pass the shine Jelly watch me drink it all from that straw
But when I'm done I'm going to even eat the strawberries and all
I'm an alcoholic don`t make me pull out my xanax bars
I get fucked up and do donuts in everybody`s car
See I'm from the bay spent most of my time in the county
Growing up I got into some crazy shit
With some rowdy shotgun toting pickup truck driving country muthafuckas
I don`t send my goons I send my rednecks after you suckers
I'm Lil Wyte the leader of the pack plus I am the drunkest
With Wyte music in the building muthafucka we the crunkest
What up struggle R.I.P. to your grandpa Waylon Jennings
This a new movement he started it but Wyte music going to keep it goin
Muthafuckas

[Chorus: Big Smo]
I`m just a kuntry boy(just some country boys)
Livin' out on a farm (you catch us out on a farm)
I got pounds on the other side of town with the crop in the barn (just holla at yo boy you know what time it is)
Just sippin' on shine (yeah we sippin' on shine)
Sippin' straight from the jar(we sippin' straight from the jar tell em Wyte)
Law dogs is a huntin' us down cause they know who we are (Jelly you know they know who we are baby)

[Outro]
