[Chorus: CB3]
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' in a water hole
Livin' this Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' that water hole
Livin' this hick life wild like a rodeo

[Verse 1: Brahma Bull]
Country boy hick life
White tee rebel flag
Catch me dirt road ridin'
John Deere Cadillac
Just a country boy livin' like my papi said
Hustle in these fields 'cause I gotta keep the family fed
Hit the back road pick a case of Firewater up
Mama's keep 'em close cause I might pick your daughter up
Hick life boy with a redneck attitude
Daddy got me livin' right pops here's my gratitude
Stayin' on the trail you can call me a huntin' dog
Big country boy keep it hotter than a fire log
Keep that grease hot now I'm ruttin' like a wild hog
With the k3 puff puff like the mornin' fog
Drinkin' on the farm though we don't even need the bar
Hick life drinkin' shine straight from a mason jar
Double wide big smoke hick life you feelin' it
Big country white boy backwoods killin' it

[Chorus: CB3]
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' in a water hole
Livin' this hick life wild as rodeo
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' that water hole
Livin' this hick life wild like a rodeo

[Verse 2: Bottleneck]
Raise 'em up for the south one more time
You know we from the woods but we still on the grind
Got my double odd buck 'bout to take my aim
You know that hick life 'bout to kill that game
We the p.i.m.p southern supreme
Still bake hill biscuits with my home grown team
Poppin' the green the cattle we got 'em
If you want a slow fish come straight to the bottom
Gotta dig in the dirt just to find my bone
Gotta dig in these drawers and you can find my chrome
Move on [?] makin' country tunes
Big Smo and Double Wide we lettin' it loose
Kickin' brahma boots, drinkin' them suds
Country livin' hick life that's what's up
Hop in the hog pit stank on my boots
Hick life southern style with the southern roots
Yeah

[Chorus: CB3]
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' in a water hole
Livin' this hick life wild as rodeo
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' that water hole
Livin' this hick life wild like a rodeo

[Verse 3: Big Smo]
Some south livin', welcome to the country y'all
Born in the southern sticks, raised on a cattle farm
Fishin' down at Duck River, sippin' on apple pie
Smoke a cedar shrub, got me felt and feelin' super fine
Keep a couple super dime homegrown cuties
They're prize winnin', fair ground, Tennessee beauties
With the Boston butt booties, slow cooked and seasoned
Lift a skirt like a mud bug and give me one reason
I swear no teasin', I'll take her down a dirt road
Straight through an open field where the moonlight glows
Skinny dippin' in the pond underneath the open sky
Frog gig jiggin' on the bank with them super dimes
Damnit boy I'm super high, K3 cushy
Rum and dot hit the spot like high school nookie
I'm a monster out the cage you can call me Honky Kong
Big boss of the sticks and I'm hick life strong
Come on

[Chorus: CB3]
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' in a water hole
Livin' this hick life wild as rodeo
Grew up doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar swimmin' that water hole
Livin' this hick life wild like a rodeo
