[Intro: Smo & Upchurch]
Sha, you know we leaders in this shit
We know the way, go the way, and show the way to those who follow
Hahaha
Come take a walk, see where we from

[Verse 1: Smo]
It's been a long time comin' (come on) and this boy's still drummin'
Hell I bet you motherfuckers thought you saw the end comin'
Been an artist in this market while y'all just gettin' started
Separated from the fakes call them my dearly departed
I'm best under stress so I'm fuckin' with friction
With a tank full of gas on the road with the riches
In a jacked up Chevy with a cab full of bitches
Slingin' mud on the world country boy on a mission
I'm from Tennessee and it pumps through my veins
Where barbed wire replaces concrete and the chains
Where handshakes are hugs, we fly our own flags
The home of homegrown and trailer park labs
I just hit up Church told him meet me at the led out
I'll be in the K5 you should bring the Vette out
Seein' folks Snapchattin' live when we get out
Tennessee country boys the rest are just sell outs

[Chorus: Upchurch & Smo]
Where you from
Where I'm from, the sticks of the Ten
And I can take you several places most people never been
Where you from
Where I'm from, the heart of the south
Where a fist of sweet potato pie can shut your mouth
Where we from
Where we from
The land of the mud and if you want it best believe you can get it from us
Where we from
Where we from dirt roads and backwoods by the county line round them Tennessee hood

[Verse 2: Upchurch]
I'm from that boggin' dirty Chevy swervin' 26's on the burban
Hit the stage like Elvis Presley you won't ever catch me nervous
Got creek water in the Mason jar them stop signs got bullet holes
Where dead bodies get covered up by rednecks with them backhoes
From an itty bitty town in the middle of the map
Where the Chevrolet shine and the tailpipes clap
When I ride through town girls break they neck
Tryna' get a little glimpse of the man in black
Smoke rollin' out of that cracked glass
Like tobacco farms on a back road
Craigslist game lookin' too strong
And the bow shot in my front yard
I ain't ever had no wish game
But I roll in a 58 bitch thing
Your girl wanna ride like a puppy dog
But shit I forgot that bitch name
Got a devil and she smile with these snake skins
You might get the venom if you mess with me
I'm on my Big Smo shit bitch when I'm kickin' it in Tennessee
I'm a boss reppin' square dancin' square body mud slingin'
Shit talkin' gun sprayin' Cheatham County crazy hen
With a little hint of that Bocephus
Want some than come see us
I stay lookin' for them throats so slit
Everyday I wake up it's huntin' season

[Chorus 2: Upchurch & Smo]
Where you from
Where I'm from, small town in the pines
With guns like the military everyone of them mine
Where you from
Where I'm from, my home sweet home
Them 32 acres every inch I own
Where we from
That volunteer state what you see is what you get we'll bring it straight to your face
Where we from
Where we from
From Bedford to Cheatham
My people like your people and they gon' swarm when we need 'em

[Outro: Upchurch]
Aw yeah, man these punks ain't got shit on us Smo
What these fuckers know 'bout that Tennessee shit
Yeah
Tri-star motherfucker
