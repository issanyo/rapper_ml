[Intro]
You know out here in the country we keep an open gate policy
It's like mi casa su casa, ya dig?

[Verse 1]
You know I keep a four wheel down a dusty trail
With a little southern sweetie hot on my tail
And there's really no telling what the hell we gonna get into today (Aww yeah)
You know I got a swimming hole and a fishin' poll
An old ice cooler where the brew is cold
And you know i'ts back yonder where we always go
(Where we at) passed the fields of hay (lets go)

[Chorus: Darius Rucker]
Come on over to my place where the living is good as gold
Come on over to my place where you can learn ya something old
I can show you where I come from tell you where I'm about to go
Over to my place we let the good times roll
We let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I remember them fire flies in the moon lit sky
While them shooting stars just passed on by
And you know its just like them hands of time
(There they go) slowing down to wave
Ain't nothing like a love fire by the river side
On a tailgate til the morning light
You know she's snuggled up right by my side
Until we get carried away (Come on)

[Chorus: Darius Rucker]
Over to my place where the living is good as gold
Come on over to my place where you can learn you something old
I can show you where I come from tell you where I'm about to go
Over to my place we let the good times roll
We let the good times roll

[Verse 3]
Aw yeah, let me open up the gates so y'all can roll on in
Kick back with your folks and let the fun begin
Take a Dixie plate, here go a Solo Cup
Go on and help yourself, yeah we can fix you on up
Cause the drinks are chillin and the barbeque is grilling
Got the jacked up trucks in the mud hole spinning
Bonfire ready for a hell of a night
It's gone get a little rowdy but you'll be alright

[Chorus: Darius Rucker]
Over to my place, Where the living is good as gold
Come on over to my place, Where you can learn you something old
I can show you where I come from, Tell you where I'm about to go
Over to my place, we let the good times roll (Come on, Come on, Come on)
We let the good times roll (Come on, Come on, Come on)
I can show you where I come from, Tell you where I'm about to go
Over to my place, We let the good times roll
