[Intro]
You know, people always think the most painful thing is losin' the one you love in your life
The truth is the most painful thing is losin' yourself in the process of lovin' someone
And at some point, you have to realize that some people can stay in your heart
But not in your life

[Verse 1]
Yeah love at first sight
Whaddent what I imagined
And factuation, mislead the reckless passion
Misguided actions from one to another
Down a path of lies that I had to uncover
Plans to be a mother for an unborn dream
Long time to be free, everywhere we would meet
So I just let it be and hope for the best
Only to discover you were just like the rest
Took kindness from weakness and turned it to pain
For no better reason than personal gain
To drive me insane and to drag me down
Where I sit now, alone and with doubt
A heart that was pure and built to last
Now broken and bruised from my so called past
To left me with nothin' but wasted time
That I should've invested into my own life

[Chorus]
I cover my eyes
My eyes are covered with shades
The shades that hang in my house
My heart is in there locked down, Babe
I cover my face
So nobody can see
The tears that fall onto my cheeks
Or the holes inside of me
And baby you
Understand but maybe you don't maybe I
Understand but maybe I won't baby I know
The sun ain't goin' down anytime soon
So I cover my eyes
Yeah I cover my eyes
When I look at you (Ooooooh)

[Verse 2]
I had big dreams to live and let love
Hangin' in the balance so push comes to shove
I wasn't above that standard you met
I try but never reach the status you set
I let you build me up just to tear me down
Cuz I didn't have what it took to turn your frown around
Like you did my heart, still I was always there
That's why we fell so apart but you never did care
It was a dead journey in the beginin' to end
After what I went through we could never be friends
You tore out my trust, ripped off my smile
Stained my soul with your sinister style
N' all n while I wadden't built for you
I deserved a better life with a love so true
Cuz life's to short to live with a mistake
Even if it feels right the stress is bound to break
A good man down to simple and true
Which is what lead me here finished with you
Nothin' left to do but to pack our past
Toss it out the door soak n' wet in the grass

[Chorus]
I cover my eyes
My eyes are covered with shades
The shades that hang in my house
My heart is in there locked down, Babe
I cover my face
So nobody can see
The tears that fall onto my cheeks
Or the holes inside of me
And baby you
Understand but maybe you don't maybe I
Understand but maybe I won't baby I know
The sun ain't goin' down anytime soon
So I cover my eyes
Yeah I cover my eyes
When I look at you (Ooooooh)
Ooooooh
Ooooooh oh oh oh...
