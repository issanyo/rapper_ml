[Chorus]
Down in the backwoods, round from the holler
Mama and papa, taught me the value of a dollar
How to treat your kinfolk, live off a dirt road
Now everywhere I go I take a little bit with me

[Verse 1]
Now as a little youngun I was country as cornbread
Rowdy as a wasp, man, sharp as a thoroughbred
Quick to take a dip in that Sugar Creek spring
And trot the woods with some rocks in my old sling
Now papa showed me how to live off the land
With everything around and these two bare hands
How to make it, break it, fix it like new
How to plant it, grow it, harvest it through
Till that full moon hung high in the sky
We just shook it and move it down by the state line
Bring home the bread, stuff it down in the jar
And get up early with the sun so we can do it some more, you know

[Chorus]
Down in the backwoods, round from the holler
Mama and papa, taught me the value of a dollar
How to treat your kinfolk, live off a dirt road
Now everywhere I got I take a little bit with me

[Verse 2]
Down that old dirt road what we had our own
Kinda mystery a whole lotta history was grown
When we did what we was told by the law of the land
Affected under the direction of a disciplined hand
Mama taught me how to love my family tree
And be true to the kinfolk that make up the leaves
To shake the life we live, all the love we give
Everywhere I go you know we gotta represent
For them country buckets till the day that I die
By the dirt road code so remember my life
There ain't never been a problem this old boy can't fix
And I would never change a thing about these backwood sticks

[Chorus]
Down in the backwoods, round from the holler
Mama and papa, taught me the value of a dollar
How to treat your kinfolk, live off a dirt road
Now everywhere I got I take a little bit with me

Down in the backwoods, round from the holler
Mama and papa, taught me the value of a dollar
How to treat your kinfolk, live off a dirt road
Now everywhere I got I take a little bit with me
