[intro]
Yeah
Uh
Come on

Ain't no explaining it, listen I'm just saying it
You keep detaining it so quit with all that blaming shit
Keep it in the fast lane, man, what a damn shame
To hell with your pass, wipe my ass with your last name
I see the finish line closer by the minute
And yeah boy I did it, nothing left to do but spit it
But if you can't admit it go and take another shot
I've been on a mission waiting 'fore my first album drop
And cuz I never stop, take a look at where it took us
State to state love and the bars wanna book us
Radio to shipper till we took over the satellite
Oh what a feeling, I'm just waiting for the fight

[Chorus]
Come and get some
But you better bring the big guns
'Cause I don't quit until the bell's rung
I just keep swingin', swingin'
I'll go one more round
And keep on fighting till the last count
I might be hurt but I ain't knocked out
'Cause I just keep swingin', swingin'
Till I bring 'em down

Yeah
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Come on, if I can't make it I'ma break it for the rest of us
So pick another lane up out my way 'cause I'm about to crush
The competition, they missing, they ain't no winners
They beginners in this game and I eat shit like they for dinner, uh
Turn 'em into scraps, feed 'em off to the needy
If you thinking that I'm tripping imagine if I was greedy
But I'm not so you can stop with all the bullspit, I'm fighting for
Release the ones who didn't bullshit, hah
Pacing out my corner like a killer on the move
Step up to the best you think you got something to prove
I keep swingin' for the win, never settle for a lose
I defeated all the rest now I'm coming out for you

[Chorus]
Come and get some
But you better bring the big guns
'Cause I don't quit until the bell's rung
I just keep swingin', swingin'
I'll go one more round
And keep on fighting till the last count
I might be hurt but I ain't knocked out
'Cause I just keep swingin', swingin'
Till I bring 'em down

Yup
Uh
Come on

[Bridge]
Come and get it, get it, yeah you can get it
Hit 'em with that left right combo, hit it
Come and get it, get it, yeah you can get it
I'ma hit 'em with that left right combo, hit it

[Chorus]
Come and get some
But you better bring the big guns
'Cause I don't quit until the bell's rung
I just keep swingin', swingin'
I'll go one more round
And keep on fighting till the last count
I might be hurt but I ain't knocked out
'Cause I just keep swingin', swingin'
Till I bring 'em down
