Rolling down the highway
Back out on the road
Push that pedal, make that money
Till we make our way home

If you're true southern brand, country to the core
Raised in the sticks on an old back porch
By a mama and a papa who skinned that hyde
For being anything less than American pride
Toe to toe you know, I'm knee deep in the grits
You can't hang with this country boy off in the pits
Jack 'em up, roll 'em out, let's see you got
Apple pie in the mix, go and take your shot
I'm a top shelf hustlers, true south soldier
Got money in the mason jar, my bank account solder
Hard pill to swallow, tough fact to follow
If you want it you can get it, come on down through the holler
Plenty kinfolk that'd love to come harm ya
Feed you to the hogs, got a plug with the farmer
I'm backwoods style I'm tryna double every dollar
Yeah they tryna hold me back but I'm true to my collar

Rolling down the highway
Back out on the road
Push that pedal, make that money
Till we make our way home

If you're feeling how I'm feeling let me hear you say come on
You get it how I get it and you're with me holla come on
You're living how I'm living and you're with it scream come on
Come on, come on

All I see is headlights shining, I'm out here grinding
You've gotta put your time in, we'll leave I put mine in
That's why I made the march booth photograph signing
My jaw half full sipping on the silver lining
Been on it past 10 and hell yeah I rode the lightning
Got knocked down, got back up fighting
They owe me like a sirloin, boy quit biting
Believe me if it's been from the farm I'm a bison
You're sweeter than cream, softer than icing
I'm high def 3D rarely exciting
You ain't gotta love it you ain't even gotta like it
But you gotta respect these words that I'm writing
Right hand like Tyson, beard like a Viking
Live at the [?] tell me where to put the mic in
Battle of the [?] so I'm out here climbing
Breaker one-nine boy come find me

Rolling down the highway
Back out on the road
Push that pedal, make that money
Till we make our way home

If you're feeling how I'm feeling let me hear you say come on
You get it how I get it and you're with me holla come on
You're living how I'm living and you're with it scream come on
Come on, come on everybody
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, every come on
