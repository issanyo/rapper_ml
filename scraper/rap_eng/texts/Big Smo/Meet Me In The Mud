[Verse 1]
Kinfolk
Where your trucks at
Where your side by sides
Jack em up one time
If you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud
If you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud,  mud, mud, mud
Yeah from the hot and muddy
To the cold and dusty baby
We gettin in the mud holes and back wood trails
Coast to coast
Jack them up let’s roll
Kinfolk, hey
Mister mud boss
Packed in the truck it’s time to get lost
We’re fifty deep jacked up in the back wood
Cooler full of Pabst blue ribbon yeah we all good
The mud part pumping
My people piling in
We stick it to the back
Cross grand daddy’s pen
Side by side
Sideways in the high life
Sippin shine, blowing on something out of High Times
We’re knee deep baby
Come and get it with me
I got my top throwed off
K 5 Chevy big block revving
Once the tires grip sink em off in the deep end
Don’t let them get stripped
Four wheel drive pull us up out the muck
You got something on your mind
Go and get stuck
With some of the women getting bucked
Off at my ride
Time to take it back to the camp by the moonlight

[Chorus]
Bonfire lit up to the sky, party
Mud to the fitness when we ride, shorty
Dirt trail living is the life for me
Lordy, holler, if you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud
If you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud

[Verse 2]
I done see the best of the best
Eat the mud getting thrown off
Looking like a pen full of hogs in a slop trouff
Spinning wide open in a puddle of muck
And don’t think for a second getting stuck in my truck
I got 35 gripping
Fresh mud dripping
Full jar of shine for the dirt tread slipping
All the women tripping just to ride my side
And take them down that bumpy road in my four wheel drive
I hear them back wood boys out raising hell
Gripping through the out cutting them trails
Chasing high speed tail all the way to the mud club
Crank another cold one and find me some mud love
I need a bathtub but I ain’t even tripping
We down by the river I just tripping and dipping
And I get back to my mission party with my kinfolk
Bout to load up and get stuck in a mudhole

[Chorus]
Bonfire lit up to the sky, party
Mud to the fitness when we ride, shorty
Dirt trail living is the life for me
Lordy, holler, if you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud
If you wanna meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud
Meet me in the mud
Meet me in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud
