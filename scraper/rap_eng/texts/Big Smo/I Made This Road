[Chorus]
Been through the struggle, paid dues with my life
Cards on the table, it's my game so you better fold
I made this road
My blood, sweat, and tears pouring like burning liquor
I'm on that new shit and you'll always be on the old
I paved this road
I made this road

[Verse 1]
With both feet on the ground, one step at a time
My aim is on point and I'm going for mine
Spitting hit after hit drop 'em every season
Change the game as we know it
Now they all wanna be him
I'm not standing for nothing I wouldn't fight to the death
Your words are garbage makes me wish I was deaf
I live it line for line, every rhyme for rhyme
The top was wide open so I made it all mine
Take a shot at the boss, your career is a loss
Hell, a billion dollar budget couldn't fix what you brought
So take it back to the start and look deep in your heart
Cause y'all don't have what it takes to make a place on the charts

[Chorus]
Been through the struggle, paid dues with my life
Cards on the table, it's my game so you better fold
I made this road
My blood, sweat, and tears pouring like burning liquor
I'm on that new shit and you'll always be on the old
I paved this road, I made this road
I made this road

[Verse 2]
No genre can hold this sound in my soul
See what I've become is more precious than gold
The value’s unknown cause it's never been done
But I know that it's hot
It shine bright as the sun
I been there and won most things that you dreamed
Crossed over crossovers and shit on mainstream
I fight for a team whose struggle is real
The future was uncertain as a 360 deal
We delivered the proof and paved our own lane
We took what was ours, and gave up the fame
We planted a name and built it to grow
We call it the future, you know it as Smo

[Chorus]
Been through the struggle, paid dues with my life
Cards on the table, it's my game so you better fold
I made this road (I made this road)
My blood, sweat, and tears pouring like burning liquor
I'm on that new shit and you'll always be on the old (on the old)
I paved this road (hey)
I made this road
I made this road
Been through the struggle (oh yeah)
Yeah I fought with my life (oh yeah)
Cards on the table (put ‘em down yeah)
Yeah I played ‘em just right
Been through the struggle, paid dues with my life
Cards on the table, it's my game so you better fold
I made this road (I made this road)
My blood, sweat, and tears pouring like burning liquor (hey)
I'm on that new shit and you'll always be on the old (old)
I paved this road
I made this road
