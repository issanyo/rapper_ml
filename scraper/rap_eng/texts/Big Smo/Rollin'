[Verse 1]
Wide open got the tail pipes smoking
Lane to lane floating
No GPS loading
Cuz even when I got no place to go
It's just me, myself, and the open road
And when I hit the I-24
You damn right
Gonna put the pedal to the floor outta sight
I'm gone but baby I'll be back by dawn
'Til then crank my favorite song

[Chorus]
I got that clear blue sky
Sunshine on my mind
Highway by my side
Yeah, I'm doing just fine
I feel that wind blowing through my soul
Tellin' me which way that I need to go
So I keep rollin', rollin' rollin'
You know I gotta keep it rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Now if you're on a dirt road
Or in the grass
If you going real slow
Or movin' fast
As long as you're feelin' it
In your soul
Better let them windows down
Turn it up

[Verse 2]
Now my old school Riviera can't be stopped
My Chevy looking pretty when I drop the top
So everybody in the stix they know
When they see the whip rollin' they be like “That's Smo!”
Baby they ain't no other way to go
Hauling ass while I listen to the radio
Hit the gas
No doubt, y'all know what I'm about
I put the key in the ignition and I'm out

[Chorus]
I got that clear blue sky
Sunshine on my mind
Highway by my side
Yeah, I'm doing just fine
I feel that wind blowing through my soul
Telling me which way that I need to go
So I keep rollin', rollin' rollin'
You know I gotta keep it rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

[Verse 3]
Now if you're on a dirt road or in the grass
If you going real slow or moving fast
As long as you're feeling it In your soul
Better let them windows down
Turn it up and let’s roll

[Chorus]
I got that clear blue sky
Sunshine on my mind
Highway by my side
Yeah, I'm doing just fine
I feel that wind blowing through my soul (whoo)
Telling me which way that I need to go
So I keep rollin', rollin' rollin' (oh yeah)
You know I gotta keep it rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
