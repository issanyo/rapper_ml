[Chorus]
I'ma make 'em say my name
This for my folks
Just for the heat
Who stood in the cold
My name
From the back of the club
Up to the front row
They gon' say my name
And the ladies for sure
They all love 'em some Smo
So I take 'em back home
Just to make 'em say my name

[Verse 1]
Since back in the day, one thing on my brain
Do what it takes to build up my name
Before all the fame, one foot in the game
Throw fuel on the flames and let it just blaze
Hell what can I say this who I am
Same good ol' boy that don't give a damn
Whatever it takes to be my own man
Paying my dues, hand over hand
Y'all know me, straight Tennessee
Country Boy sipping on mama's sweet tea
Kicking up mud just for the love
Reality is what you see on TV
It's kinfolk for life, that's what it is
My fans are my family just like my kids
My team is on point so they handle my biz
I said I want bangers they bringing me hits
Like this

[Chorus]
I'ma make 'em say my name
This for my folks
Just for the heat
Who stood in the cold
My name
From the back of the club
Up to the front row
They gon' say my name
And the ladies for sure
They all love 'em some Smo
So I take 'em back home
Just to make 'em say my name
For those who don't know
Or doubt in my flow
Just keep saying my name
Ya ain't holding me back
You helping me grow
You want it, just say my name
Every stage, every show
Everywhere that I go
All over the globe
I'ma make 'em say my name

[Verse 2]
He called me John boy
My mother she said I was trouble
I got the nickname Big Smo
From my older brother
Since then I carried it state to state
Meeting with everyone face to face
Putting up posters places to place
That's how I filled my fanbase
We got billboard tour bus
Couple stickers on big trucks
T-shirts on my groupies
Autographs on my CDs
All y'all haters bitch please
Knuckle up till y'alls fists bleed
Realize you can't stop this
And everybody gon' know me

[Chorus]
When I make 'em say my name
This for my folks
Just for the heat
Who stood in the cold
My name
From the back of the club
Up to the front row
They gon' say my name
And the ladies for sure
They all love 'em some Smo
So I take 'em back home
Just to make 'em say my name
For those who don't know
Or doubt in my flow
Just keep saying my name
Ya ain't holding me back
You helping me grow
You want it, just say my name
Every stage, every show
Everywhere that I go
All over the globe
I'ma make 'em say my name

[Bridge]
(Smo, Smo, Smo, Smo)
(Smo, Smo, Smo, Smo)

I hear 'em hollering
Speak it Hick Ross
Smocephus, big boss
King of country, hip hop
The list goes on and it don't stop

[Chorus]
I'll make 'em say my name
This for my folks
Just for the heat
Who stood in the cold
My name
From the back of the club
Up to the front row
They gon' say my name
And the ladies for sure
They all love 'em some Smo
So I take 'em back home
Just to make 'em say my name
For those who don't know
Or doubt in my flow
Just keep saying my name
Ya ain't holding me back
You helping me grow
You want it, just say my name
Every stage, every show
Everywhere that I go
All over the globe
I'ma make 'em say my name
