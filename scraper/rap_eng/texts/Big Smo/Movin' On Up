Ooh, yeah, mhmm

[Chorus]
I used to think that I was stuck
But then I changed, changed, changed, changed my luck
Said I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up yeah

[Verse 1]
Moving on up
Made it from the gutter don't stutter
Doing how no other brother gonna do it
Filling my cup, this that Tennessee Southern
With the gravy and the butter getting to it
Come from little to nothing, now I made it to something
I got skill so you know I gotta use it
Back in the Stix
Thinking how I'm gonna get rich
Busy making this trap music
Hot damn, cooking with the pots and the pans
Back when I used to sell grams
My man, told me if I come up with a plan
And hustle with my hands
One day I'll be moving on up

[Chorus]
I used to think that I was stuck (oh yeah)
But then I changed, changed, changed, changed my luck (oh yeah)
Said I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up yeah (oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Moving on up
Made it from the broken glass
To throwing cash
It's raining on the dance floor
Change my luck
Yeah it took sacrifice to rap this nice
And do it on a damn tour
Now we going state to state
To take my place among the greats
So what more could I ask for
Keep it going city to city
I put my name on they titties
And go and hit it from the back
Till they back sore
Got her like slow down
What you gona do now
When I come up in your town
Straight business, yeah I got taught
It ain't a crime if you never got caught
So believe that I'm leaving no witness
When I'm moving on up

[Chorus]
I used to think that I was stuck (oh yeah)
But then I changed, changed, changed, changed my luck (oh yeah)
Said I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up yeah (oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
Moving on up
Made it from the bottom
If you got a problem take it to the streets
Let's solve them got them like what
Run your mouth see what I'm about
You can get your ass kicked if you talk shit
Made it through the mud
Made it through the tears, sweat, blood
Made it when nobody ever said I could
I was clocking in at five
I was getting home at ten
Made a promise to myself
Never to do that shit again
It's a hoe down look at me now
Back in the ville I'm the talk of the town
Never had much but I made a vow
I'm a play the beat loud, do them proud
Cause I'm moving on up

Yeah we living the high life now baby(oh yeah)
Don't watch me, keep [?] (oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I used to think that I was stuck (oh yeah)
But then I changed, changed, changed, changed my luck (oh yeah)
I said I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up (I'm moving on up)
I'm moving on up yeah (yeah)

[Outro]
Moving on up (oh yeah)
Better put it down
Moving on up (oh yeah)
