[Verse 1: Big Smo]
Yes sir, well its only popping
The honky tonk rocking
Women out getting on the dance floor stomping
Fellas watch em, wiggle and a hoppin'
Serving up shots till their tops start dropping
Have another, pass it to my brothers
Girlfriend, her friend, sister and her mother
Try to get smothered, chopped up and covered
Like some waffle house hash browns, serve me up another
Jukebox lover, dollar for a dozen
Pour us up a round just to keep the party buzzin'
We come to kick it, then get lit with it
So turn me way up, I want to feel it when we hear it

[Chorus]
Oh lawdy lawdy, look who come to party, we got everybody here tonight
All my fellas and my ladies its gonna get a little crazy
On that whisky wine beer and shine

[Verse 2: Big Smo]
Let me see
Well we got wet T-shirts on mechanical bulls
Dirty girls like to get their pigtails pulled
The bars full, take it to the parking lot
The crowds to rowdy for this small town local spot
Damn who called the cops? Everybody pile up
Take it to the farm and light the bonfire up
Tailgate, keg stand, jacked up, feeling fine, [?], [?], Home grown, Cedar Pine
Southern downs, flock them by the truck load
Middle of the Hay field, ready for the mud show
They make the blood flow, hot in the mix
Yea a party ain't a party till you kick it in the stix

[Chorus]
Oh lawdy lawdy, look who come to party, we got everybody here tonight
All my fellas and my ladies its gonna get a little crazy
On that whisky wine beer and shine

Oh lawdy lawdy, look who come to party, we got everybody here tonight
All my fellas and my ladies its gonna get a little crazy
On that whisky wine beer and shine
