[Chorus: Burney]
No more locks, no more chains
No more crying out my name
And I'm finally free
To be lonely
No more truth, no more lies
Just to live I had to die
Now I'm finally free
To be lonely
To be lonely

[Verse 1: Smo]
Yeah I've stood face to face with my worst enemies
And fist to fist with all these lies built from greed
And the protection that I used was a reflection of you
When the pain overcame all your infectious abuse
When you can't stop you won't, when you want to you can't
So rock bottom was the foundation where we built what we had
And now I'm just glad that we stopped at the start
But the healing has been like dealing with a million scars
And it coulda been worse, much like a evil curse
Like all that mattered was your Gucci or that Louis V purse
So pull up that hearse 'cause this love is gone
And I bury your memory and be free to move on

[Chorus: Burney]
No more locks, no more chains
No more crying out my name
And I'm finally free
To be lonely
No more truth, no more lies
Just to live I had to die
Now I'm finally free
To be lonely
To be lonely

You words are like bullets and arrows
You pull the trigger, I let go
There's no more room for two, no
'Cause I had to save myself from you

[Verse 2: Smo]
You were the nightmares I dreamed of while I was wide awake
The end of my salvation when all I had was faith
And never once did you concern yourself with all of your mistakes
That I mistook for ignorance and scraped off of the plate
Now I'm here you're cleaning it up while you drink from my cup
As it overflows with the love I let run amok
'Cause how close we used to be is how far we've grown apart
And I'm still picking up the deal while you're filling up your cart
Like trying to sabotage every car in my garage
Could ever fix our situation, these problems, they don't dissolve
But it opened up my eyes and finally let me see
That I'm blessed to be free and free to be lonely

[Chorus: Burney]
No more locks, no more chains
No more crying out my name
And I'm finally free
To be lonely
No more truth, no more lies
Just to live I had to die
Now I'm finally free
To be lonely
To be lonely

[Outro: Smo]
Yeah see you think you know someone
And then you dedicate your life to loving that person
Only for them to become this deceitful monster
That manipulates your trust and all of your passion
But it's never too late to release yourself from that mental prison you know
You can free your soul even if it means being alone
