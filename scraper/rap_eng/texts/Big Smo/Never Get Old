[Chorus: Dunne]
When I'm far away
And it's hard to sleep
Just the thought of you
I'm smiling from cheek to cheek
Forever young together
That's how we'll be
Growin' up with you
Will never ever ever get old to me

[Verse 1: Smo]
You been like the sun shinin' down my face love
Told myself I'm a boss, wouldn't chase love
First we break up then make love
Then we fight again and I hate love
Girl, I guess that's how this here goes
We can keep it on the hush and tip-toe
We can take it to my place and get low
Or we can hit the bar until the spot close
When I'm on the road doin' shows in cities I don't know
Who you think I got runnin' through my mind
I been makin' stacks it's a fact that when I get back
Promise that I'm gonna give you all my time
I got you girl

[Chorus: Dunne]
When I'm far away
And it's hard to sleep
Just the thought of you
I'm smiling from cheek to cheek
Forever young together
That's how we'll be
Growin' up with you
Will never ever ever get old to me

[Verse 2: Smo]
That's right
This love will never ever ever get old to me
This love will never ever ever get old to me

All I need is one microphone, two shots of Hennessy
One for my kinfolk, one for my enemies
One bad woman with good energy
She got hood tendencies that I could take back to Tennessee
Damn, now that's what I'm talking bout
Like the money put the honey in my hand or I'm walking out
Make a scene like pay-per-view
I got ring side seats, I'ma stay for you
Watching love unfold don't ever get old
Naw, every day is feeling brand new
'Cause no matter how far when you look up at the stars
Know I'm lookin' at the same ones too, hold me down baby

[Chorus: Dunne]
When I'm far away
And it's hard to sleep
Just the thought of you
I'm smiling from cheek to cheek
Forever young together
That's how we'll be
Growin' up with you
Will never ever ever get old to me

[Outro: Smo]
You know why
This love will never ever ever get old to me
You keep me smiling
'Cause this love will never ever ever get old to me

Looking at the same stars no matter where we are
This love will never get old to me
This love will never ever ever get old to me
