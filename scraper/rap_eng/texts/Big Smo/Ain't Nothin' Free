[Verse 1]
Way out in the country in a old dirt road
I was sippin on a jar that was nice and cold
My Chevy was a jumpin' my music was a bumpin'
Up a head I swore I saw somthin'
Well she was with as long legged with a big ol' butt
Had soft blonde hair that was pretty and cut
I could tell she was stuck and into some trouble
She was walkin' down the road just shaking that bubble
So I pulled up on her with my window down said hey you pretty thing can I drive you to town she said "thank you baby I was dying of heat ain't had a lick of water ain't had nothin' to eat"
She put her hand on my handle and I said hold up
Before you go climbing into my pick up truck it takes more that a smile to turn these wheels
So before we get going here's the deal

[Chorus]
Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass no gas no grass no ride

[Verse 2]
Well she said hell no so I left her there she was shooting me a bird in my rear view mirror
I got a few miles further down the road then my dagum right front tire got blowed
Well wouldn't you know I ain't gotta jack
I left it in my grandpas Cadillac
I started thumbing my ways back into town that when I flag an old punch bug down
Surprise surprise you know who that same damn girl I didn't give a ride to
Now I said baby would you believe I was comin' back to get you when a nail got me
Is pretty damn funny meeting up like this
I hope you ain't the kinda women that will still be pissed
She said "nah baby its all good as long as its understood"

[Chorus]
Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass, no gas no grass no ride

Well if wanna come along with me ain't nothing in the world for free
No ass ,no gas no grass no ride
If I can't smoke and I can't poke it better get my V8 stroking
No ass, no gas no grass no ride
