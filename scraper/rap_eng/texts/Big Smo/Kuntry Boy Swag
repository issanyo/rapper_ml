[Intro]
This right here is no swag! (it's your kinfolk big smo, for all my kuntry folks)
This right here is no swag! (some of that kuntry boy swag)

[Chorus]
Kuntry boy swag, Kuntry boy swag, kuntry boy kuntry boy kuntry boy swag
From my hat to my boots to the budz in my bag
You can bet the whole farm on my kuntry boy swag. (this is good right here)


[Verse 1]
They call me Hick Ross, holla honkey kong
And raise a cold cup up when you hear this song
When your feelin' strong, just like your southern fry
Red white and blue soul filled with kuntry pride
You can see it in my eyes, blood sweat and blistered hands
I'm brewed tough and hold it down for the simple man
I got a simple plan, just keep it kuntry baby
From the stix to the bricks back woods livin' crazy
Take it off the top, down my family tree
Me and Tim west coast full blood and breed
I'm with my only team, we call it kinfolk
Kuntry boy swagged out in real bud camo
Redneck girls and my trucks gone wild
And my southern swag stretches far as a country mile
From my hat to my boots to the budz in my bag you can bet the whole farm on my kuntry boy swag

[Chorus]
Kuntry boy swag, kuntry boy swag, kuntry boy kuntry boy kuntry boy swag
From my hat to my boots to the budz in my bag , you can bet the whole farm on my kuntry boy swag
Kuntry boy swag, kuntry boy swag, kuntry boy kuntry boy kuntry boy swag
From my hat to my boots to the budz in my bag , you can bet the whole farm on my kuntry boy swag
