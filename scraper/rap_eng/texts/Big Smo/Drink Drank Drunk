[Verse 1: Cowboy Troy]
Beer in my left hand, shine on my right
Get it crankin couple beers drinkin all night
Celebrate party goin on 100 proof turnt up to the max
Gon raise the roof
Can't see strait, I got my vision blurred
Line em up boss, cause I ain't never scared
Its the king of the club with a round of crown
I might wobble but I don't fall down
GET YOUR BEER GOGGLES ON
AND WAVE YOUR BOTTLE UP
GET YOUR BEER GOGGLES ON
