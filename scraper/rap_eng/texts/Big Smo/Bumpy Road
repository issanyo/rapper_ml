Hop on in, Baby Girl. Let's go
Slide on over, and hold me close
Climb on top, cause we about to roll
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Got the music cranked up, and the beat down low
Sittin' real high and ridin' real slow
Sippin and smoking with your boy Big Smo
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Oh yeah, the sweet summer night;
The sky's wide open, and the moon's just right
My Chevy's sittin' tall, covered in mud
And I'm thinkin' bout you and a six-pack'a suds
On an old back road where the blacktop ends
Don't tweet this, girl. It ain't for ya friends
Now, ride around the corner where the creek bed bends
It gets a little bumpy, no time to buckle in
Hold on tight, hell slide a little closer
You're rollin' wit a big boss, girl. Climb over
Let the bump bu-bu-bumps just jiggle ya guts
Now drop it on me baby, while I steer through these ruts and...
Hop on in, Baby Girl. Let's go
Slide on over, and hold me close
Climb on top, cause we about to roll
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Got the music cranked up, and the beat down low
Sittin' real high and ridin' real slow
Sippin and smoking with your boy Big Smo
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Hell, I'm as country as cornbread, taters, and hog-jaw
Wild as a billy goat, slick as a bullfrog
Buck as a whitetail, rippin' them trails
Smashin' in my side-by-side, and raisin' hell
Pickin' chicken to the women and they're ready to go
You know them mud bog mamas that are willin' to roll
The bumpier the road, the funner the ride
She love it when the motor vibratin' her thighs
My shocks get to jumpin' when the bumps get to bumpin'
Got the throttle wide open, try'na do a little schuckin'
At the back of the bog, where the trails get rough
You'll find this ol' country boy rippin' it up. C'mon...
Hop on in, Baby Girl. Let's go
Slide on over, and hold me close
Climb on top, cause we about to roll
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Got the music cranked up, and the beat down low
Sittin' real high and ridin' real slow
Sippin and smoking with your boy Big Smo
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Hop on in, Baby Girl. Let's go
Slide on over, and hold me close
Climb on top, cause we about to roll
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Got the music cranked up, and the beat down low
Sittin' real high and ridin' real slow
Sippin and smoking with your boy Big Smo
Down a bump, bump, bumpy road
Play that country music, white boy
Just let that country music take you home
I say
Play that country music, white boy
Just let that country music take your soul down that bumpy road
