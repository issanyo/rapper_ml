[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Jumped out the whip on 'em
You know how I get homie
I'm too strong for these thug brothers
Too smooth for these rough cutters
Tryna be me my whole life
But I get caught up with that old life
Yeah, you know how the thinkin' go
But I'm 'bout to get it on tonight
Hold tight, hold tight, whole squad with me
You seein' them, you seein' me, man it's the same difference
Unashamed, unashamed, no we ain't changed
Ok, your boy might be a little different
Go hard, like concrete, oh Lord
When you tell me I be in these streets, yeah
Get it poppin', quick, quick, quick
That's the feelin' jumpin' out the whip

[Pre-Hook]
Jumped out the whip, now we ain't got no problems
'Bout to get lit, ain't nothin' that gon' stop us
They can feel it, but they all in they feelings
They can get it, tell 'em all better get it
They can feel it and it's all alright
They can get it, get it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Jumped out the whip on 'em
I'm bein' me, I'm the one and only
Steppin' out so clean, ain't a stain on me
Ooh it's goin' down, and now they know
Swingin' hard like I'm Andre Ward
Make it slow, tell 'em press record
I ain't playin' around
Yeah, yeah, they givin' up but I'm stayin' down
Get it right, man I'm gettin' to it
Why we livin' and flippin' in it, this is why we do it
Malo lava, malo lava, man it's so good
And I'm jumpin' out the whip to prove it
Shine on 'em, yeah, man we shine on 'em
Every time, wastin' time, ain't got time for it
Whip clean, my whip clean
I ain't ridin' dirty, man I'm pristine jumpin' out the whip

[Pre-Hook]
Jumped out the whip, now we ain't got no problems
'Bout to get lit, ain't nothin' that gon' stop us

Tell 'em dog, it's time to get it on

[Pre-Hook]
Jumped out the whip, now we ain't got no problems
'Bout to get lit, ain't nothin' that gon' stop us
