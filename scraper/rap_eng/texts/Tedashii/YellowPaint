[Intro: Tedashii]
Man I consider my life a nothin'
If I could just finish the race and complete the job the Lord Jesus gave me
I live to tell the world His message
Romans 1:16, I'm not ashamed, I ain't ah-

[Chorus 1]
Look me in the eyes
I don't want no lies
I just wanna know
Is you really mine?
I don't want no games
I just wanna lay
With you by my side
Is you down to ride?
Look me in the eyes
I don't want no lies
I just wanna know
Is you really mine?
I don't want no games
I just wanna lay
With you by my side
Is you down to ride?

[Chorus 2]
Anytime I'm with you, I feel a feelin'
I can't even know, no, no, no, no
Anytime I'm with you, I know I never gotta be alone
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go nowhere unless I'm wit' 'cha
Baby, you my pretty young thing, you my thriller
And I don't wanna play no games, no games, no more
I just wanna ride, you down? I'm down, let's go
Finally home, finally home on our own, finally yours
Finally home, finally yours

[Chorus 2]
Anytime I'm with you, I feel a feelin'
I can't even know, no, no, no, no
Anytime I'm with you, I know I never gotta be alone
No, no, no, no, no

[Chorus 1]
Look me in the eyes
I don't want no lies
I just wanna know
Is you really mine?
I don't want no games
I just wanna lay
With you by my side
Is you down to ride?

[Verse 2]
Holy moly, hold me please
You know, I'm too out of reach
I never saw life in her eyes
But every time I would approach
She told me "Keep things on the low"
Little did I know, she came in straight for my soul
And I hid from the Truth, so hold up
Sweet like honey and the lips so smooth
And I gave her my youth tho, hold up
Dazed and amazed by the way that she moves
Said "You don't gotta go anywhere from here
If you hold me close, I could hold your fears
Let me be your buzz, we could fly light years
Through clear frontiers but you might just die."
Hold up

[Outro]
I really like the people we're becoming
