Benjah:
We’ve been programmed to worship
But the wrong gods we flirt with
Run after all that glitters
Deceived by smoke and mirrors
It's a never ending maze
Can't see clear with this haze
Need the Son to burn it off before we get too lost

It's like
Everywhere I'm lookin' man, still not satisfied
Don't know why I'm lookin' fam, with these wandering hungry eyes
It's like I'm eating everyday, but I'm never really full
Always wanting more, so I keep on chasing after

Rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows
They come out after rain
Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows
Always waiting for the rain

Tedashii:
Yeah I need it, need it
Gotta get it, get it
Can't live without it, out it
S-so where is it, is it?
That's such a prison, living living for thrills and getting getting whats not that, yeah such a mystery, is it not really
Will it give me this?
Can it give me that?
I feel it in my grip, I won't ever give it back
I need it like I'm fiending
I'm out here scheming
Life can be a nightmare, gotta keep on dreaming
Gotta keep on reaching, scratching, scheming, asking, seeking, grasping, needing, pleasing
This thing to me man, it's just like air, yeah the only reason I'm breathing

Benjah:
Help me please don't ever leave till I get this in my life
My everything I'll ever need forever be alright, right

Tedashii:
Don't believe the hype
Fairy tales just ain't real life
Dreams do come true, but don't be fooled man what this world will push to you is...

Benjah:
Rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows
They come out after rain
Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows
Always waiting for the rain

Chasing rainbows everyday, they come out after rain
Have you ever met a man that found the gold they give away?
They say, don't you give up now, you almost got it found
Keep chasing and keep wanting; just keep spinning round and round

Money, money, money, that's all they talk about
The richest man can't afford rain in a drought
Money, money, money, that's all they talk about
The richest man can't afford rain in a drought

We’re all born with this thirst, but it's so far from a curse
Drink dirty water you’ll get merked, call the doctor and the nurse
It's not the thirst thats wrong, it's what you turn to that's what harms
Hear the siren hear this alarm, and don't fall for the charm no

Chasing rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows
They come out after rain
Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows
Always waiting for the rain

Chasing rainbows everyday, they come out after rain
Have you ever met a man that found the gold they give away?
They say, don't you give up now, you almost got it found
Keep chasing and keep wanting; just keep spinning round and round
