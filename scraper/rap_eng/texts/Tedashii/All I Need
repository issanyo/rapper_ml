[Intro – Tedashii]
I see you’re all I need
Father God, I see you’re all I need
You’re all I need
God, God you’re all I need
To tell the truth Lord you’re all I need

[Verse 1 – Tedashii]
They said I was going crazy on the campus when you saved me
‘Cause I stopped partying and chasin’ all the ladies
And they told me I was losin’ it, calling me a lunatic
Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it
Man I heard the rumors, calling me a joke
I’m praying saying, I wish they knew what I know
‘Cause if they did they would see
How you were meant to be much more than the God of emergencies
You’re the God that elected me, chose and selected me
When nobody else would mess with me
Never neglected me, you even loved me when you corrected me
Hands down you’re the best to me
I spent years of my life
Trying to be liked or be like the people who seemed light
Following the crowd, trying to be allowed
Into a world where everything seemed right, but …

[Chorus – Chris Davis & Tedashii]
I wrote this song to tell you Lord, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need, God)
And I know you’ll never fail me Lord, you’re all I need
And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy
Father, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need)
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in
Around me, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need, all I need)

[Verse 2 – Tedashii]
From saving me to raising me, shaping me and changing me
Embracing me, taking me, making me yours
Amazingly and graciously when I was lost and wavering
Couldn’t get from A to B, you opened the door
I deserved to be left there in distress with the rest there
Right there in my mess yeah
Still believing all the lies, the world can satisfy
I almost died, pushing you to the side
What a fool, making crazy moves
About to lose all I had for a buzz and a thrill
We too easily satisfied and that’s just how Adam died
He was in the place where the love wasn’t real
But the more I get to know you
The more I get to know truth, and through you I see who I am
My identity revealed as you show me how to live
Through examples of the God-man, that’s why …

[Chorus – Chris Davis & Tedashii]
I wrote this song to tell you Lord, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need, God)
And I know you’ll never fail me Lord, you’re all I need
And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy
Father, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need)
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in
Around me, you’re all I need
(You’re all I need, all I need)

[Outro – Tedashii]
You’re all I need
Father God, I said you’re all I need
All I need
God, God you’re all I need
To tell the truth Lord you’re all I need
And when the times get crazy and my vision gets hazy
Father, you’re all I need
When my life needs saving or the world starts to cave in
Around me, you’re all I need
All I need
