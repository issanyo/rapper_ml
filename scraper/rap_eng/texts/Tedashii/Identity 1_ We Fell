And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
His story, meant to be the story
History recorded at the start of every story
Christ lost the culture, all for His glory
To display his power, now fast forward
Let us make men in our likeness and in our image
For his glory, but through sin things got distorted
I get the point when I watch Mory Poravich
I am not the father, man, I have no control of this
Flash black, front side of the tempting
Picture the same cool breeze, sun dipped in
The service led is over, spittin' venom showed 'em
Eve flip flopped like some Japanese zorith
Adam followed suit too, like he had four of these
Hands weeped we fold Satan backdoors these
Identity fades, it exceeds poorly
Not lost, but stained at the cross for His glory
"So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate."
With fear and shame, mankind was overtaken
Eyes open wide and they saw they both were naked
Traumatized they flee the scene like a driver that's been drinkin'
So in leaves as they leave, try and hide amongst the trees
Cuz they hear God comin' and like sinners they start runnin'
Already they confused and how they see God is blury
Feel compel in the runners if they gonna get done in
With ease God speaks as he strolls through the breeze
Seeking man out Asking him "Where are You?"
Cuz mankind is lost and his vision got marred too
The results of it all, the fall of mankind
God cursed the serpent plus the man in his pride
Picture of the here and now, why people can't hear and now
Rejected by their sin and overwhelmed with the here and now
Created to be in His image, better showin' his glory
Reflectin' to the world 'til the end of His story
