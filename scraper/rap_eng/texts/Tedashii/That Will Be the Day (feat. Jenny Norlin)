Listen to the soundabove
Hear the music from the sky
Oh, The day is near
Forever we be there
Heaven is a beautiful place
We will laugh untilwe cry
Feel the love we can't deny
Uh, I'm only passing through; I can't keep still
I'm a stranger, that's for real
Evacuatin', this is not a drill
Alien baring fruit;
My crop circles and to feel I'm from a different world
Dwayne Wayne you remember
I even flipped my glasses no bartender
Mixed up in this crazy world keep the blender
Because I'm goingback home and return to Sender, yea
But I knew that would
If He held it down for me then, then I knew that I could
Hey, as soon as he come back to get me hop in the corna'
You can call it graduation baby minus the diploma
Raise your flutes to the truth
Have a toast on the new life
Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate
Heaven on our minds
No pain just pleasure
No sin just God forever
And ever
And ever
And ever
Thatwill be the day
It. Is. Wonderful
And man no feeling can describe it
And even thoughI try to there's little that can define it
Any emotions like a potion be controlling me
Island Ocean living when these visions get a holdof me
Yea, interest to the King of kings
And I don't need a rosary
All I need is Him, Him, Him
Who I need?
The One that exist in Three
And not for me but for his glory
It's Him and not me He the star of this story
Heaven isn't heaven if God isn't there
If He isn't I don't want it might as well stay here
But we won't, that's my hope
I knowthat it gets better and we will be with God and we gonelive forever
Like the song say, No sin enjoyingHim for eternity
Raise your flutes to the truth
Have a toast on the new life
Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate
Heaven on our minds
No pain just pleasure
No sin just God forever
And ever
And ever
And ever
Thatwill be the day
Beautiful vision
Our life as a mission
Love and perfection
And all our dreams will come reality
Face the joy for an eternity
Jesus Christ in full intimacy
Raise your flutes to the truth
Have a toast on the new life
Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate
Heaven on our minds
No pain just pleasure
No sin just God forever
And ever
And ever
And ever
Thatwill be the day
