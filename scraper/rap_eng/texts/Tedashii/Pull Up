[Verse 1: Alex Faith]
Let me show you what the scene like
Pull up to the spot in a car you never seen like
Double cup, swisher full of purp
See me lean like
Always on that Gold Rush
You know I’m a fiend right?
I just described every song on the freakin’ radio
Destroy the youth but stack that paper guys
Huh, way to go
Flexin’ so they know we gonna see ‘em when they ride through
Theme music, I ain’t hatin’ this is what we ride to
In the hood, teach ‘em how to be fools
And the kids in the suburbs how to be cool
I don’t blame ‘em though
I know it’s deeper than rap
I can’t just do a song and fix it
It’s much deeper than that
Uh, the heart of man is evil
And the world don’t make it better
They got chains all on they chest
But deep down you know that they beggars
We despise wisdom, glorify lies
Leading us to Hell
But we turn that track on high
Tell ‘em

[Hook: Alex Faith] [2x]
Every time I pull up they be like
Ay shorty what you on?
Play that so-and-so
You know that one
Now that’s my favorite song
Every time I pull up (4x)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I got that front, back, and side to side
Trunk crankin’, sounding loud
Ridin’ ‘round my side of town
Beat up these streets bruh speed up
Pedal to the metal tires screaming ah
*scrrrr*
Every time I pull up, car full of
We in here 40 deep no sleep
H-Town we cruisin’
North side that Houston
Beat loud, we boomin’
Please excuse my intrusion
Slow-mo we moving
So slow, confusing
All those that’s zooming
So I hit the brake, they do a double take
Where I’m from that’s every day
Where I’m from they advocate, candy paint
Pop that trunk and turn it up
Let freedom reign
Different than your average
They after praise and accolades
Me too dude but I’m through with being a fool
Tryna prove I had it made
That’s why I’m on the block
Yeah, that’s why my car go knock
Man ‘cause you gon’ get this work
Whether you like it or not
You can mock, we ain’t shook
No earthquake, just aftershock
Spit these power lines, they shock
Every time I pull up, stop

[Hook: Alex Faith] [2x]
Every time I pull up they be like
Ay shorty what you on?
Play that so-and-so
You know that one
Now that’s my favorite song
Every time I pull up (4x)

[Verse 3: Corey Paul]
Sub got it knocking right
Pullin’ up with my patner
My little cousin ridin’ ‘round right now
With a probation violation in his pocket
I could smell the purp in the air
See the hate in they eyes
Know that they still chop dope
That’s why we sing hope
Tryna sever these ties
Force fed the little homies
You don’t really want it
That cup of purp will get you fed time
You ain't tryna get lost in that county
I see young kings in them Polo tees
Young queen in that Michael Kors
No price tag on what we endorse
That’s freedom cuz and you can’t afford
My old man got worked for it
They pierced Him in His side
Momma sent me to church for it
She put me in that choir
So when them bullets rung
And my little brother died
I left the pistol in the house
And told her shoot ‘em by God
Who saves us
Pray to God he felt it
‘Cause I meant it when I said it
That false teaching didn’t vet it
It’s infectious if you let it
Slingin’ antibiotics, no mollies
Pop prednisones and antihistamine blockers

[Hook: Alex Faith] [2x]
Every time I pull up they be like
Ay shorty what you on?
Play that so-and-so
You know the one
Now that’s my favorite song
Every time I pull up (4x)
