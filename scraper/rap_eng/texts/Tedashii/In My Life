Baby, can't you see
Your love is the air I breath
As long as you are here with me
I can do anything

There ain't no storm we can't weather
As long as we're together
Our love will conquer them all

I'd trade in the money, fame and cars
Just for a piece of your heart

Cause you're all I need and want in my life
You're all I need and want in my life
You're all I need and want in my life
You're all I need and want in my life
In my life

Since the day I saw your face
I knew you were the one for me
And everyday I hope and pray
That you will always be here with me
Yea

Cause Imma love you in the morning
Imma love you in the evening
Imma love you forever
Baby, Imma be there in the mid-night
Holdin on to you for dear life
Imma love you forever, forever
Baby, Ooooh
Baby, Ooooh
