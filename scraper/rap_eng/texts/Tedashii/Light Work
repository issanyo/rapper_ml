[Intro]
De La Soul

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, this just somethin’ light, I look to my life
Then I look to my wife like, I did somethin' right
Look I’m not switchin' my price
Baby, I know what I’m worth
I be like, “Thank God it Monday”
I get to get back to work, aye
Shine like, gold, they don’t want story man
They want a soundbite, I’m like, no
Look around like they see you on a mountain
They don’t see you on the climb, right?
Me and all of mine in the powerline
Look at this and put your phone right

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
Bright, shimmer, lights, flicker
All this light, let it, shimmer
I had to glow up, I had to show up
I got the light now, check out my glow up
Bright, shimmer, lights, flicker
All this light, let it, shimmer
I had to glow up, I had to show up
I got the light now, check out my glow up

[Verse 2: 1K Phew]
Striped up and they wiped up (huh? heh, yeah)
Most of these folks hyped up (huh? heh, yeah)
I’m in the bag fasho'
I’ve got to stack of a bag to throw (stack up a bag?)
Hop in the bag fasho'
We just making the stacks for mo'
Lights flippin', gotta make sure that they with you
Better go look at the pictures
Man, I fear nothin' but scripture
I’m in the field, when I get down I’m takin' a kneel
I’m in the field like fire drills
I know they lovin' the thrill

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
Bright, shimmer, lights, flicker
All this light, let it, shimmer
I had to glow up, I had to show up
I got the light now, check out my glow up

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Light bright like it's Friday night
Might kneel like I’m Kaepernick
Line of sight like it's itemized
Real faith with no asterisk
Light Bearer like the Mercedes
Messenger since the first day
In a white tux ’cause I stand out
All alone like first place
I got buzz like jeeper
Throwback hits like Jeepers
Keep up I might leave ya
Team way up like Chiba
They taking shots like they had the ball
Shot like a rocket we blastin' off, whoa
This is the aftershock
Back from the grave like I'm Lazarus

[Verse 4: WHATUPRG]
Back out the grave like a king, uh
I had to show them the ink, uh
You couldn't mess up the team, uh
All of my homies, they gleam, uh
Take a photo
All my homies never solo
I’ve been leanin' like a cholo
Light in season and got dobo, whoa

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
Bright, shimmer, lights, flicker
All this light, let it, shimmer
I had to glow up, I had to show up
I got the light now, check out my glow up

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
They can’t stop that light, man, it’s way too bright
116 for life, for my squad I ride
Jesus by my side got nothin' to hide
We still unashamed, we still ‘bout that life
New moat of mercy, I swim in that
Light of the world, yeah I give them that
I give up my life and I get it back
The whole squad here but you figured that
My partner's was pushin' the lean, yeah
So I was pushin' the king, yeah
They sippin' acts' so I had to act
I’m shinin' my light on the scene, yeah

[Chorus: WHATUPRG]
Bright, shimmer, lights, flicker
All this light, let it, shimmer
I had to glow up, I had to show up
I got the light now, check out my glow up

[Bridge: CASS & Trip Lee]
I wanna shine for you
I wanna shine for you
I wanna shine for you
I wanna shine for you
I had to glow up
I had to glow up
I got the light now
I got the light now
Yessuh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 6: Trip Lee]
Hey, pick a side, this that flicker side (flicker)
That gorgeous glow up with all that flicker, great (flicker)
Our power so great take a look inside (yeah)
Toast, we living elixir 'cause we the Vicar’s bride (yeah, yeah)
Pick a side (oh yeah), I can’t debate (no)
We came awake, still darkness
Targets still aim away (bang, bang)
This song might not hit radio but we radiate
That beam won't run out of steam, till we stand face to face
So go shine, go shine lil' homie
Go shine, go shine young lady
Go shine, go shine lil' homie
Go shine, go shine young lady
