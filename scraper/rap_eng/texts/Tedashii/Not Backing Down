[Verse 1]
I walked the line
I stay out the way, yeah
Never speak my mind
Livin' in a shade of grey
But the more I got to know me
The more you start to show me
This isn't how it's meant to be
So I'll just keep on walking
And you can keep on talking
I'ma have to make a scene, yeah

[Chorus]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
No I'm not backing
No I'm not backing down

[Verse 2]
I've watch the game
I've stood on the side line
That same old same
But now it's my time, yeah
Cause if you don't stand for nothin'
You always fall for somethin'
This isn't how it's meant to be
So I'll just keep on walking
Let him do the talking
I'ma have to make a scene, yeah

[Chorus]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down

[Bridge: Tedashii]
Yeah, I been there, did that
Afraid to be me, so I hid that
Gripped with the fear, so I disappeared
Then dropped to the ground like a missed catch
But I, I'm done with that
You can tell 'em all that I'm done with that
No more backing down into the background
That’s now, cause I put them old habits down
I follow da leader
And where he may take me may make me a leader
It’s wrote on the wall all you need do is read it
Can’t be a lame duck and try to soar with the eagles
So I'm crossin' the line
Tell 'em all dog that I lost too much time
Ain't stayin' in this place cause I gotta win the race
And I'm runnin' for the crown
Ain't backin' down now

[Chorus]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
