[Verse 1: Tedashii]
I'm good, no halo, just wooden beams to hang on
No angel for my angle, I'm gonna fight it 'til I win, no K.O
Invincible and I'm turnt up, any obstacle, I'm running through it
On ten, He stepped in, he saved my life (hallelujah)
Ain't tryna to brag, ain't tryna to boast
Well yes I am, I am showed up and saved my soul
High art, classic genius, that's smart, workmanship, it's not hard
For some it is over ya' head, my God
I'm good baby, oh yeah, I'm good baby
I'm super straight, no debate, I wish you would baby
Peep my stride, I abide since He made me come alive
Is that where He would reside, true, he ain't never tellin' no lie

[Hook: Beam]
Gunshot a everyday thing
Bodybag a everyday thing
? peace we a bring
We donâ€™t want to walk away
But who would show us, Jaja
? take the ladder
Who would show us, Jaja
Me no have no problem for fear me brothers
God know

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I'm clean, no detox, I see white like my Reeboks
I put on from my own, no one we copy, no xerox
I'm good, yeah, cause I been who I'm made to be
From alpha to omega, you still trying to get from A to B
But sin starts small, down low like that post game
'Til the light hit this world, watch us like a dope, man
That shark, and it'll cut you like a razor mane
Besides your sound wave, no you'll never catch me wavering
No, I got it, oh, I'm so 'bout it
My risky business raise the bill up, yeah but God got it
I'm living royalty, the son of a king, for me
It's jaja, I'ma tell you one more t'ing, aah
