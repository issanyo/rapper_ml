[Intro: Benjah]
I don't wanna be alone (x6) (goodbye x2)

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Tears hit her checks
Like Tyson's glove
Pain hits us hard
As she fights for love
She says "don't go!"
But the call came
It's time to deploy
And they called his name
Close to zero-five hundred
Her mind starts wonderin'
Butterflies, tummy starts rumbin'
Queasy, uneasy tryin' to hold it all together
She doesn't want their last moments here to be unpleasant
The car ride is quiet
Outside it's hard to fight it
Inside it's like she's dyin'
That's where she started cryin'
He tries to comfort her
"Baby it's alright"
Liar!
That's what she screams louder from the thoughts of fright
They pray
"It's okay, I promise that I'll be safe"
That's what he tells her as he looks her in the face
And as he walks away looking in her eye
Last kiss as they say

[Hook: Benjah]
I pray this is not our last goodbye, goodbye
I pray this is not our last goodbye, goodbye (goodbye)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Graduation
Her nine weeks are done
Hoorah, hoopla
Now it's time to move on
Leavin' out of basic
She just got her assignment
She's headed off to war and it's hard for her to face it
Or face her
The daughter that she's leavin'
It's hard to come to terms with the truth
No one believes it
And even when it's staring in your face
You don't receive it
She hears "mommy"
And it's just like her heart stops beatin' (beatin' x2)
Inhales, heavy breathin'
Worried when she leaves she may not be back to see them
Her baby girl, and the family that she loves
Tryin' to hold back the tears right now it's tough
She fights to stay strong
Gotta hold on
She says a prayer
Just tryin' to find a calm
Thoughts of eternity
Then back to reality
In fear she tells her family

[Hook]

[Outro: Benjah]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't want
I don't wanna be alone, no
(x8)
