I see kids
Wildin' out
They pops was out
I see it like a flash back
That empty life
Now in christ, I finally got my dad back
God was that he snatched me back he got me off that fast track
Of chasing dreams and manish things
Like power, pleasure, and respect
Taught me that a selfish view, never was a healthy view
Here's some help for you who struggle too, living past that
Selfish gain or selfless aim, hey baby they gone clash black
Worldly wisdom or scripture, it ain't but one that has facts
Tried it all, all alone, but found that I was handicapped
Strength I lacked
Abused by this world you can have it back
See the fact remains I was changed when I heard his name
I know he's real
And I'll never be the same

I'm in love with one hand in the sky
I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes
I know I was born into sin
But now I'm in christ yes I'm born to win
I know, I know, that jesus lives
And I know, I know he is my king
And that's why, that's why I'll always sing
Jesus
Thank you for saving my life
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
(hey) thank you for saving my life

See with us evident, most of us, we hope; I know, to get inside
We expect to be in heaven but baby we gotta die
Die physically and inwardly
But some men will be
Foolish in their ways and trust they self continually
Growing in their pride, eyes closed so they can't see
Walking blind all the time, too arrogant to see their need
I can hear the preacher preach, reaching out to you and me
Begging us to look to jesus and no longer be deceived
Cie-cie-cieved, by the enemy
Or the sin in me
That says to be sufficient independently
I'm so glad to be walking on the straight and narrow
I know that god got me if his eye is on the sparrow

I'm in love with one hand in the sky
I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes
I know I was born into sin
But now I'm in christ yes I'm born again
I know, I know, that jesus lives
And I know, I know he is my king
And that's why, that's why I'll always sing
Jesus
Thank you for saving my life
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
(hey) thank you for saving my life

So from the newest life, the truest life
I know that he's real
From the changes in my stride to the way that I feel
Something different, you sense it
Even momma was trippin'
Wondering like alice asking me, hey boy what's gotten in you
I said, jesus is real (heeey)
This ain't just a religion
I done tried to practice habits but man nothing was sticking
But his love and his joy and the peace that he brings
Man was dead in sin till jesus came on the scene
Now it's a wrap
For ya boy
No more, quiet on set
I'm telling everyone I know
I ain't ashamed to represent
I love him
No one above him
I'll forever worship
Hands high to the sky
As I show my love to him
(sing)

Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Jesus, thank you for saving my life

I'm in love with one hand in the sky
I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes
I know I was born into sin
But now I'm in christ yes I'm born again
I know, I know, that jesus lives
And I know, I know he is my king
And that's why, that's why I'll always sing
Jesus
Thank you for saving my life
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uhoh, uh-oh
(hey) thank you for saving my life
