[Verse 1]
I am just a man with a name from Japan
In a War like Iran
When they fought though I ran
No I stand, man confused, I don't know who I am
As they trick me like a scam
Into they army uncle Sam
I dont wanna talk about it,get into it, but Im in it
Born with it like my image as they long for somethin vintage
Fake games like a scrimmage as I'm pushin to my limits
I Just wanna get up out it like a college but Im Remy
Takin shots from the roof top like subliminal
Im the one shootin at myself like a criminal
Im a Flo-rida but im somethin like a Seminole
Im aim low mayne I ain't talkin bout yo dinner bro
That's just the start of it
Dont let my family part of it
Influence truancy in these cuffs that'll scare your wrists
I dont think my heart's in it
It won't get better
Later "Sorry man" I had to let you down like an elevator

[Hook x2]
No I'm gone, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm gone, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm gone, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I can't get with you

[Verse 2:]
Pain in my stomach turning
Pressure got my heart burnin
Weird cause the boy be
Like it doesn't feel as urgent
I remember hazy nights
Bass bumpin head thumpin
We extreme goin off the deep end
Bungee jumpin
But the pleasure that I got from that
Is feelin like a coffin
That I feel trapped in
Till He came and bought me back
Christ entered in
No more me trying to be you
He then more now
I'm trying to help you, see you
Evil like a serpent
You don't see it, but it's certain
Chasin cars with partitions
In they end they still curtains
