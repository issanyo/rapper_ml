[Verse 1: Crowder]
Who has the power over slavery's hand?
Who has the power to free a man?
Who has the power who holds the throne?
Oh, my sweet Lord

[Verse 2: Crowder]
Who has the power to part the sea?
Who has the power to rescue me?
Who has the power to save my soul?
Oh, my sweet Lord

[Chorus: Chorus]
Glory, hallelujah
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
Glory, hallelujah
I'm longing for the promised land

[Verse 3: Crowder]
Who has the power to heal the heart?
Who has the power to light the dark?
Who has the power to make me whole?
Oh, my sweet Lord

[Verse 4: Crowder]
Who has the power to conquer death?
Who has the power to raise the dead?
Who has the power who holds the world?
Oh, my sweet Lord

[Chorus: Chorus]
Glory, hallelujah
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
Glory, hallelujah
I'm longing for the promised land

[Bridge: Crowder]
Is there no balm in Gilead?
Is there no healer there?
Can boundless love ever reject
Any soul that's in despair?
Who has the power?
Who has the power?
Who has the power?
Oh, my sweet Lord

[Chorus: Crowder]
Glory, hallelujah
My feet will stand in the
Promised land, oh
Glory, hallelujah
My soul will rest in the Savior's hands

[Refrain: Crowder]
Sing glory
Sing glory, my sweet Lord

[Verse 5: Tedashii]
Yea, uh, uh, uh
On the banks of the river looking for chances to get up
Stir up the pool and bring healing to bones that's feeling brittle
I've been beat up in the streets, but I believe something's coming
There's no way I can move unless You choose to do something
This life, this life is so heavy; lost my son, he in heaven
I was chasing this leaven
Hanging with dudes that is deadly, but this life is now over
Moreover I'm ready go on
I'm ready to change it all
Lord, just help me I'm all in
On the banks of the river
Looking out for the promised land
Tell Him I need Him now, I don't have any other plans
Sweet Lord, I know I need You
There's relief from the grief when I see You

[Outro]
I sing, "Glory, hallelujah!"
We sing glory, sing glory
(2x)
