Remember when we were kids/saying things that were did/
By me and you but too ashamed to admit that th-th-they were fibs/
Sippin' on Mr. Pibb/playing with neighbors kids/
And I front to fall asleep/so I could chill at your crib/
House parties like play and kid/listening to Gangster Nip/
Tripping off Ghetto Boys/how they mind kept playing tricks/
Hide and seek with my sisters friends/Tonight like DJ Quick/
Natural born sinners slowly loosing our innocence/
This was all just the start of it/like working with a starter kit/
I went from bad to worse when I saw Cube put on that Starter fit/
Pressure started marching in/cause all my friends were part it/
It seduced me even more/like a girl who plays hard to get/
"Cool" gave my heart a kiss/told me, give my all to this/
Did it all/so I felt obligated to be part of this/
Anything to garner this/stardom that was hard to miss/
Fartherless, so Hollywood guided, through the dark abyss/

Stepped in the cineplex/just passed the Cinnabon fin to see what's playing next
(yes)
HOLLYWOOD
(HEY) I got my butter and my popcorn
My crew is with me and we feeling like it's not wrong
HOLLYWOOD
Like it's so cool to watch upcoming attractions, blinded by the distractions
Don't be so complacent
With cheap imitations
Need godly inspiration so we can't replace it, with HOLLYWOOD

Remember when we were kids
Saying things that were did
By me and you but too ashamed to admit that th-th-they were fibs
Hooping up at the gym
Lust had us chasing Kim
Acting hard but riding clean bumping that BoysIIMen
Watching the latest films
Quote it and take it in
Lustful flesh
Had us actin gangsta like Doughboy did
Lived like them
Boys in the hood but stayed trill
Out the Tre, so you can say I'm Furious Styles kid
My Love Jones was shai
But my Justice was Poetic
All I needed was the Juice
Ad then my Blues would be Mo' Better
I would listen to the Preacher's Wife
But I'd go back like Boomerang
My set would Set It Off and we'd be right back in that New Jack swang
Pride of Life had me like O-Dog and Higher Learning guided me
Momma said Lean On Me
But I'm a Menace to Society
All that "drama" mixed with sinning, the women with them in linen
Seem to spark a cycle unrivaled and never ending (ending)
Stepped in the cineplex
Just passed the Cinnabon fin to see what's playing next
(yes)
HOLLYWOOD
(HEY) I got my butter and my popcorn
My crew is with me and we feeling like it's not wrong

I been learning from this teacher, since
I was in the nursery
A victim of its preaching cause she said she'd give the world to me
At least that's what I thought I heard
Hollywood was celebrated
She could easily mess up the lines of real and imitation
And like Adam, we ate the fruit of prideful racketeering
Just so we could all see Eve without the leaves
And bangled earrings
It's the lies that they tell you, you start to believe
And if truth is what you make it
Then you're ready to receive
A slave to the trade/sinful ways cause of this artistry
Until I met the One, who was knocking at my hearts entry
Some say He's unattractive when compared to the glitz and glam
But, I was glad to look behind the bush to see a ram
Who set me free from sin, along with false identity
Because until we know the Savior, God is our enemy
So don't let the world and its devices, advise you
Instead trust the truth of the Father found in the bible
