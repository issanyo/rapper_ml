[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Okay, okay
What's up, let's get it in
Showcase His love He gives to men
He saved us, shaked us, give Him praises
From VA to Memphis, Tenn
How could He take us back
Us who lusted, chased the calf
'Fact our ways was wack, wack
Like tryin' to bring the 80s back
So come on, get low, low
That's the way it should go, go
Men and women in the body
Living Godly, never shoddy
Giving praises fo' sho', sho'
(All day) You came and died for me
(All day) Believe I'll rise for Him
(All day) Dog if you feelin' this
Then get yo hands high for Him

[Chorus: Tedashii]
God is sovereign and gracious, with mankind He's been patient
Gave His only Son so He could redeem us and take us
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
He's the peace be stiller, grace and mercy giver
We've decided to surrender 'cause ain't nobody realer
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH

[Verse 2: Ambassador & ?]
We got alotta rhymes that by design lay out His story
We got a God that's got alotta weight, alotta glory
This mission field, you gotta deal with alotta raps
Lotta cats worship the gods, sex, cash, and Cadillacs
Matter a fact you can catch 'em guardin' they grill
Cause another god is their ice, many keep that god in they grill
But Christ is guarding, He will save, but y'all gotta chill
Turn from the dead end to the one way, y'all all betta yield

I'm a firm believer in, in, making sure that you see His face
And that you understand life versus just some grace
That you've been given, Christ is different and you must replace
The sin within with Him and blood that He shed for grace
You gotta understand He gives life to any man
Who'll have it, if you ask Him and He'll grant it and you can
See it and it's different, maxed out, it's not religion
It's lifestyle, come and get it if you with it, with it

[Chorus: Tedashii]
God is sovereign and gracious, with mankind He's been patient
Gave His only Son so He could redeem us and take us
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
He's the peace be stiller, grace and mercy giver
We've decided to surrender 'cause ain't nobody realer
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH

[Verse 3]
Jesus, don't count Him out on account of invisibility
Countless accounts account for His will, skill, and ability
He came to save, was raised from the grave, and quickly dipped
They sit on 22s, we sit on 66
That's three times the size of the prized possession
You wanna be blessed, well, what if God's the blessing
The hidden treasure measured in infinite digits
X marks the spot, now can you dig it

If we gettin' rid of God then tell me just what stays
Cause anything left here is catching the blaze
A buncha helping like that mayonnaise
Don't know 'bout you man but that's just so crazy
If you don't know His will then know His ways
It's not His will that no one here should fade
But by His Son's grace that men be saved
You trust Him and then let those hands get raised

[Chorus: Tedashii]
God is sovereign and gracious, with mankind He's been patient
Gave His only Son so He could redeem us and take us
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
He's the peace be stiller, grace and mercy giver
We've decided to surrender 'cause ain't nobody realer
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH

God is sovereign and gracious, with mankind He's been patient
Gave His only Son so He could redeem us and take us
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
He's the peace be stiller, grace and mercy giver
We've decided to surrender 'cause ain't nobody realer
So lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
Lift His name up HIGH, lift His name up HIGH
