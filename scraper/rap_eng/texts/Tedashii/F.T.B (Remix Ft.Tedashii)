[Verse 1:Lecrae]
Hold up
What you say all that fame done gone to my head
Like that same power that save me
Can't raise me from the dead
They get me reading thinking bout keeping peace
While I'm raging war on myself
I feeling myself then I'm killing myself
I'm sipping on blood and I'm chewing on flesh
Just chill out we don't want to hear that mess
All that won't do that I can't do this
Pain, death, hurt, hate we done been through this
And I'm sure there's plenty more that I ain't been through yet
But I don't care though, bring on the heavy metal
I got a power living in me that'll never settle
Never leave nor for sake I'm a bleed never break
I'm a die come back with the keys to the safe
Gotta peek sitting deep for the things that I face
Can't erase God's ink wait clean with the paint
And I'm stained in it when the pain hit me
I would stain anything that you bring to me
The letter tell me what I can't do faithfully
The letter tell me what I can't do faithfully
The letter tell me what I can't do faithfully
I'm coming back from the dead what you saying to me
I can't do it
[Verse 2 Lecrae]
Back on the grind again
I know it's been a lil while but it's time again
Folks askin Crae when ya gonna rhyme again?
I'm like hold up give me time my man
See a lot of thangs change some stay the same
Went from H Town to D Town to Memphis may'n
One thang that's fasho, everywhere I go
People caught up in theyself money, cars and clothes (yep)
They talk about it all the time and put it in they songs
They drive around and play it loud like it ain't nothin wrong
And all they talk about is sinful stuff
Got everybody actin bad thinkin that they a thug (weeelll)
And they tryna drown me out, but nah they ain't gon count me out
I got a backpack full of tracks plus I keep a Johnny Mac so we can pound it out
Plus I'm bumpin dese JESUS BEATS
Whenever they SEEIN ME
People lookin all confused, cause every one of my tunes is screamin JESUS peeps
I was bumpin dat TRIP LEE
BJ rollin WIT ME
Both our heads noddin like we dozin or we TIPSY
But we ain't been drankin may'n
Nah this song just bangin may'n
Got us screamin JESUS out the window while we changin lanes, while we just
[Verse 3 Tedashii]
Riot, I said everybody riot
Tell 'em if they want, come try it
I mean, make war, everybody fight it
Done with them secrets, yep I ain't keepin' quiet
They say this won't hurt me, they lying
They just tryin' to murder me, slowly I'm dying
Lie, they lie, now they trying to body us pride
My pride, choke button, this a slaughter house
Trying to hold on, but it's hard
Screaming Oh my, oh my, oh-oh my God!

Whoa! Slave on this track, and sin is the pimp son
Homer chokin' I just seen Bart Simpson
Danger, man, cause this thing is a monster
Pro said fight cause sin, it'll harm ya
So that's what I do, till I hear the bell ring
Startin' up a riot, that's a everyday thing

La di da da, la di da di da [x2]

[Outro]
Hey man, the way I see it
I think we were made for more
Than just, ya know, the simple things that we aspire toward
We were made for more than just telling stories about
How much money we can get by selling poison to people
It's time to talk about who we are and who we can be
And we need to build each other up and not put each other down
I feel like we not talking about nothing right now
