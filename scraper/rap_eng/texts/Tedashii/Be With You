[Hook: Lester "L2" Shaw]
Uh, everything about you
Makes me glad I’m with you
The simple little things you do
Baby, hey
Can’t stop thinking about you
One plus one makes us two
Thought I bit off more than I can chew
I just wanna be with you!

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Oh yeah, you make me better
I’m great, you made me step up
Ain’t scared to say I’m blessed to
Be with you, leave you never!
This thing is so next level
That’s why I pin this letter
Hope you don’t mind me sharing publicly
Why we’re together forever
Prepare whatever, weather will never settle
Vessel will go wherever, try to get one forever, huh!
Same team, baby, I’m done with playing games
You’re my main thing, baby
You can tell it by my ring!
Committed, yeah, we did it, this isn’t
Living, flipping, we’re in it
Till our living is ending!
Yeah, let’s get it, I’m with it
Quit it, no I quit it
Not even when you’re tripping or you flip when
I don’t listen, pay attention
Baby, I ain’t going nowhere!
If you ain’t by my side, sticking with it
Love at least some would leave it, but I’m gone
For my ride, I die tripping
You’re the one I’m riding with
When these others call it quits
We’ll still be getting it like

[Hook: Lester "L2" Shaw]

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Nothing even matters, baby
On that Lauryn Hill tip
Others don’t get it, but like the ground
How do you feel this?
You’re the realest, I’m flipping like a gymnast
You’re smiling, I start to blush
You don’t even need that lipstick!
All that make-up, for you it doesn't take much
As far as I’m concerned
You look that good right when you wake up!
And I love the way you smirk when you try to hide your smile
Then you scare me, I’m a dork
Is how you float my butterfly
I wanna sweep you off your feet
And then catch you when you fall
I’m trying to be all you need
Yeah___[?]_____through my all
Plus, I know you got me too
After all that we’ve been through
Yeah, the suffer… baby girl, that’s the truth!
So let’s show this world love, for a thug
Always, always good
Everlasting, flashing at them lies we get from Hollywood!
Same team is me and you
Girl, until is world is through
I’ll never leave until I lead this world
Girl, I wanna be with you!

[Hook: Lester "L2" Shaw]

[Verse 3: Lester "L2" Shaw"
Thoughts of me living without you, girl
That’s something that I couldn’t do!
You make me whole, baby
You make me strong
And there is nothing I wouldn’t do for you, baby!

[Hook 2: Lester "L2" Shaw]
Uh, everything about you
Makes me glad I’m with you
The simple little things you do
Baby, hey
Can’t stop thinking about you
One plus one makes us two
Thought I bit off more than I can chew
I just wanna be with you!
I just wanna be with
I just wanna be with
I just wanna be with you, baby!
Everything about, yeah!

[Hook: Lester "L2" Shaw]

Everything that I do, baby
I do, I do, I do for you
One plus one makes us two
Baby, oh, oh!
