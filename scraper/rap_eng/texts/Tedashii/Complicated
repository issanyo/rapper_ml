[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Uh, complicated
Man you don’t know the half of it
Talkin to myself I need help
Feelin' empty like I never had nothing
Torture, man it feel like torture
It’s not like I was out chasin' after money and tryna get the fame and the fortune, nope!
Just doin' what we always (do) care without a clue
That’s when I got the phone call
Man now what I’m supposed to do?
Maybe if I would’ve stayed home
Maybe if I wasn’t so busy
But maybe is a maybe
A vicious circle that leave you feelin' dizzy like

[Pre-Chorus: Christon Gray]
I don’t know
I think I forgot to stop it all and now I just be on the go
I should’ve been there when you needed me really I meant to be
This wasn’t even the plan but it all just went differently
It just went differently, yeah

[Chorus: Christon Gray]
Tell me when it got so complicated
I don’t know, I don’t know
Never used to be this complicated
Maybe I should just take it slow

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Slow, feel like everything movin' slo-mo
But I recognize this, easy to spot like a logo
They say it’s the calm before the storm
But how do you prepare who do you warn
How do you recover once it come
And move on after the damage is done
I don’t know, everything
Everything feel messed up
I feel confused, all alone in my home still dressed up
In a suit and tie, askin' who am I?
It’s the truth they lie, wonderin' do I cry
Am I through with life
Man, I need to take time and slow it down
Cause you don’t know what you be doin' out here
All of my plans, they been ruined this year
Ain’t none of us safe like you in the clear
Foreign to this, but ain't new to this here
This the only way that I know life
Reminding me of my old life
It’s all bad and we don’t know why
We need to take time to slow it down (down)
Man, I’m not too different from the rest of y’all
How I trotted in my pain, you might be appalled
I’m too busy out here livin' I ain’t tryna stop
They say I should slow it down, but they don’t know it all
I hear' what they sayin', man, so do I blow it off
But if I choose to do that, then will I blow it all
All I know is I that I’m really trying not to fall
Swear this life is complicated
My God

[Pre-Chorus: Christion Gray]
I don’t know
I think I forgot to stop it all and now I just be on the go
I should’ve been there when you needed me really I meant to be
This wasn’t even the plan but it all just went differently
It just went differently, yeah

[Chorus: Christon Gray]
Tell me when it got so complicated
I don’t know, I don’t know
Never used to be this complicated
Maybe I should just take it slow

[Chorus: Christon Gray]
Tell me when it got so complicated
I don’t know, I don’t know
Never used to be this complicated
Maybe I should just take it slow
