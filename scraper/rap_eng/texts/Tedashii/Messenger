[Intro]
Cardec
One time for the Osage

[Chorus]
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I'm just the messenger
From the beginning there is no pretending yeah I am original
I lost my son but I'm still pressing on when I wanna just give it up
Here for my kids I'm trying to live this life it'll mess you up
Say what you will I'm keeping it trill I'm here that's a miracle
Live in the light let's get it tonight yeah
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
You want the blessing but I want the one they from
I'm just a messenger
He is no fake, those Yeezy's wait
They want to get me out
Just cause I speak my mind
Mind

[Verse 1]
Run it race the clock's racing
Pick up the pace time's wasting
God is watching but He patient
Take for granted what He saying
He make the play but ain't playing
Out the way with yo plans
Throwing shade like Ray Ban
He at the end like Amen
They say they know but they doubt it
I don't want no fakes around me
CZ with diamonds that's cloudy
Stay taking L's Ronda Rousey
Roll with my squad like it's loudy
Step in the place and it's crowded
My section known to get rowdy
They can't hop in till I'm out it
Flexing, yeah tell 'em that they can till they can yeah
Always saucing all day fresh up out the pan yeah
Spill it till they get it drop it poppin’ bands yeah
Life is short don't overlook it understand yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I got to live it cause this life the only one
You got to get it like yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't shoot the messenger
I had to bring it up that's what you need me for
Can't take the message out
I go the extra mile run it like marathon Malcolm they X me out
I know the business it's war in these trenches they come with they weapons out
They got agendas so watch for pretenders who say they can help you out
This world is dark but I'm here with the spark and that’s how we gon' burn it down
I came to shut it down
Down
Tell 'em I got it, I get it
Devil is real and he busy
Get Out the world trying to kill me
You can not handle the real me
I say the system is rigged
I see injustice is real
This ain't just something we feel
When one our kids get killed
Hands up don't shoot
Man down don't move
Stand up go thru
Ransomed no loot
Blood bought like new
Same road new shoes
Unashamed whole crew
All I do is speak truth
