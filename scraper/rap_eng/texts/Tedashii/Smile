[Chorus]
I just wanna see you smile
(Just wanna see you smile)
Just wanna see you smile, yeah
(Just wanna see you smile)
You know you deserve to smile
(You deserve to smile)
So know that I'm still gon' smile, yeah
I just wanna see you win
Wanna see you on the pros, yeah
It don't matter where you been (been)
Only where you tryna go, yeah
So let 'em see you smile, hey
I love when I see you smile, yeah

[Verse 1]
I just wanna see you smile (Yo)
You've been through what you've been through
No dream, you can't pretend to
Come through, ain't no issue
(Ain't no issue)
Listen, you light the room up
At the night like the moon up
Spread your life like a rumor
You the star, ain't nothing lunar
Life is hard, but it's getting better
We all harmed, but the scars, they not here forever
Looking back, moving forward
What you went through can't ignore it
Hard to laugh, so you force it
What you feeling, it ain't over
Yeah, you need to smile, yeah, you need to smile
I love the way you smile when I see you smile
You need a W, let's hit the W
Escape away, so that nothing can trouble you
Two sides on the corners in front of you
Let me show love for you, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna see you smile
(Just wanna see you smile)
Just wanna see you smile, yeah
(Just wanna see you smile)
You know you deserve to smile
(You deserve to smile)
So know that I'm still gon' smile, yeah
I just wanna see you win
Wanna see you on the pros, yeah
It don't matter where you been (been)
Only where you tryna go, yeah
So let 'em see you smile, hey
I love when I see you smile, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah lemme make it better, let me help you out (Help you out)
Offer you the care when they left you out (They left you out)
I can tell you more that you need to know
Gotta find the smile when your feeling low
Yeah, yeah, You know that we know
You know you need more (Woo)
I just don't get it, some days I might miss it, take two like a free-throw (swish)
Feel like I'm done with the old path
God got it covered the whole time (Yeah)
Yeah, I cannot go back
Yeah, you know it's facts
Yeah, you need to smile, yeah you need to smile
I love the way you smile when I see you smile
You need a win, so just tell me when
Just hit me up and you know that I'm coming thru
Two sides to the corners in front of you
Lemme show love to you

[Chorus]
I just wanna see you smile
(Just wanna see you smile)
Just wanna see you smile, yeah
(Just wanna see you smile)
You know you deserve to smile
(You deserve to smile)
So know that I'm still gon' smile, yeah
I just wanna see you win
Wanna see you on the pros, yeah
It don't matter where you been (been)
Only where you tryna go, yeah
So let 'em see you smile, hey
I love when I see you smile, yeah

[Outro]
Love when I see you smile
Love when I see you smile
Hate when I see you down
Love when I see you smile
Love when I see you smile
Love when I see you smile
Never wanna see you down
Love when I see you smile
