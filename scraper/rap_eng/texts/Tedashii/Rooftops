[Verse 1]
This light I hold inside
No way that I can hide
I can feel it rise
It's alive, it's alive

[Verse 2]
No power can blow it out
Like fire, it's running wild
See it in the sky
It's alive, it's alive

[Chorus]
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it in the street
Shout it with a passion so everyone can see
We are holding fire as long as we can breathe
Shout it from the rooftop

[Verse 3]
Brighter than the sun
There's hope for hopeless ones
Come and lift your eyes
He's alive, he's alive

[Chorus]
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it in the street
Shout it with a passion so everyone can see
We are holding fire as long as we can breathe
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it in the street
Shout it with a passion so everyone can see
We are holding fire as long as we can breathe
Shout it from the rooftop

[Bridge]
One mention of his name
Will break through every chain
You're a light in the darkness
You're a light in the darkness
One mention of his name
Will break through every chain
You're a light in the darkness
You're a light in the darkness

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Be a light, be a light
Rise up, be a light
Shine bright, shine bright
Stand strong and [?]
Bringin' the day into the night
But bringin' chains might be a fight
So we shine to the blind, bring sight, light (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And we get it how we live it
And we let 'em just how we did it
If you feel it say (oh, oh, oh, oh)
But this is more than just a boatload
It's a battle and we know just how we [?], so we (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Get ready, cuz we gotta get to it, unashamed when we

[Chorus]
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it in the street
Shout it with a passion so everyone can see
We are holding fire as long as we can breathe
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it from the rooftop
Shout it in the street
Shout it with a passion so everyone can see
We are holding fire as long as we can breathe
Shout it from the rooftop
