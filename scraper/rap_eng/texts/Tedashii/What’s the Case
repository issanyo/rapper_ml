[Chorus: J.Paul]
Please don’t ask, no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over, got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right
Please don’t ask, no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over, got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Oo, what’s the case
Oo, what’s the case
Yeah, this that love that erased all of my mistakes
Oo, oo, we got the fruit
It’s hard to swallow but we got the juice
Oo, oo, we got the proof
He my big brother so call me Young Uce
Swear that I’m tellin’ the truth
On Jesus the judge over ruled
Dismissed like the last day of school
Confession my squad we can’t lose
They say I’m gone like my roof
Hit a new gear with my coupe
Had to break out of the coop
That’s how you coup

[Pre-Chorus: Tedashii]
Y’all Poly kid with the Taulima arm numb like it’s fallin’ off
That was back when me and Crae was on the beast freestylin’ never fallin’ off
H-town so the trunk popped when the trunk knock get the tylenol
You can’t stay and I don’t sway cup overflowin’ set the party off

[Chorus: J.Paul]
Please don’t ask no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right
Please don’t ask no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right

[Verse 2: nobigdyl.]
Dyllie straight out the PD
Skate the jakes like I'm TD
Out the chains I'm Houdini
Might put bae on my CD
Ride the wave I'm dratini
That's absurd I might tweet it
T-Dot called for the feature
That's my friend just like Phoebe
I keep vans on my feet
Why I'm always OT
I don't lie through my teeth
Freedom all that I speak to
Just got tribe on my skin
And it’s permanent too
That fur coat yea that’s cool
I’m too cold I need two

[Pre-Chorus 2: nobigdyl.]
I came up with my ruth
We sync up with the truth
I broke up with my roof
I ain't talkin no coupe
I done seen Twitter dudes say now we one one six six six
I just turn of my mentions
Is that the news or is that Apprentice? Get it?

[Chorus]
Please don’t ask no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right
Please don’t ask no you can’t stay the night
Gangstas don’t dance they just lean to the right
Cup runneth over got your boy feelin’ right
Feelin’ right, yeah I’m feelin’ right
