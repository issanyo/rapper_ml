[Verse 1]
I ain't stressing I ain't stressing nah
Feeling real good about life
Been a blessing been a blessing now
Learned these things through the pain and the strife
When ya move when ya move on
When you climb those hills you had to climb
There's a mountain in the way every time
But I'll survive
Oh Why?

[Hook]
I'm good
Two Dollars in my pocket I'm good
They tryn'a get me caught up I'm good
But I ain't never going back cause I'm good
Yeah I'm good, yeah I'm good
And if they want it they can get it I'm good
Tell 'em "Man ain't coming with it" I'm good
And if they think that I'm Gonna quit it I'm good
Yeah I'm good, yeah I'm good

[Verse 2]
Keep it pushing I ain't 'movin back
Learned my lesson now I'm done with all that
New waves call for better days
Wipe out but you gotta learn to ride the wave
I've had my whole world change over a phone call
What could happen we really don't know
All that matters is that you don't fall
Keep pushing on, and on

[Hook]
I'm good
Two Dollars in my pocket I'm good
They tryn'a get me caught up I'm good
But I ain't never going back cause I'm good
Yeah I'm good, yeah I'm good
And if they want it they can get it I'm good
Tell 'em "Man ain't coming with it" I'm good
And if they think that I'm Gonna quit it I'm good
Yeah I'm good, yeah I'm good

[Bridge]
Sometimes I get fed up, fed up
But you gotta keep your head up, head up
Don't you give up, give up
I'm not here to be a quitter, quitter
It's good, all good
Made it through things I never thought I would
And never thought I could
But now I know...
