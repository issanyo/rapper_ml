[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yes sir, I'm goin on and on, get it in, yeah you know we do
Commissioned in the imaged 'til we finish, gonna bring em truth
Represent, cliqued out, 40 deep off in the streets
Bring em heat with no beats, get it to em with no priest
Yeahh, with no drama baby, that's just since he flipped the script
Tryin'to reach em where they at, boulevard or the strip
Anchorhome sunnyside, from Trinity to P.A
From Somoa to Angola to the soldiers on the base
It's His grate, that is it, the way that we are saved
I will shout it from the roof 'til they put me in the grave
It don't matter, it's whatever, I will tell em that He raised
That's the power off the Gospel, the reason I'm unashamed

[Hook]
20... 4/7... Days a week
3... 65... Yeah you know me
I get it goin', goin' til I'm gone, goin' til I'm gone [x2]
I get it - 20... 4/7... Days a week
3... 65... Yeah you know me
I get it goin... goin til I'm gone, goin til I'm gone [x2]
I get it...

[Verse 2: Thi'sl]
Wonderfully redeemed, but in the hood I m a vet
Used to vibe on them pills, used to puff on the wax
You know we get it goin... On your mark, ready, set
This is just the beginnin', you ain't seen nothing yet
All I know is the callin', [?] is my city
Man I keep it so Lou for the Kingdom I grizzly
If I'm lyin' I'm flyin, I salute to the troops
We go hard on the block, not just up in the booth
I'm on the block with the dough boys
Who fightin the dope charge
Hopin the word he hear will help him see the LORD
Till the day my casket's ready and I'm in the dirt
24... 65... we be puttin' in work!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Beat bangin... Yeah I represent Him
He was dead, but now He is risen
So I will tell the world of His grace and mercy
Livin' water what you need, yeahh man you lookin' thirsty
I'm tryin' to help them see, but they blinded by they sin
Let it go... Yeah it's likely either way I'm goin' in
Every day man I'm on it, (like the pavement with homies?)
Dippin grippin the corner, You can say what you wanna
Yeah I'm holdin it down, tryin' to let my light shine
If you thinkin that I'm trippin baby won't you come 'round?
I'm just doin' my thing, out here workin' for change
Yeah whatever they sayin, I be reppin' His name

[Hook]
