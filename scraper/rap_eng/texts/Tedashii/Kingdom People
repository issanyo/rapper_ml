Hey
I did this track for the church
Everbody talking about they livin' it dawg
But we need to see it
Sound doctrine productions
Lecrae, you a beast
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Aye, I'm not ashamed, this 116
My crew cliqued up 40 deep with this
Repentant sinners who were called against
Through the blood-stained banner, my recompence
Out of love for my Lord whom I represent
From the island of Somora to the blocks and the bricks
To the Gs in the gang with the rocks on they wrists
With they Glocks on they hips while they poppin' the clips
But dawg, it's the people dying for lack of this information
I pray that everybody
Would flock to the Rock of Ages
Especially when they find out we serve a God that's so gracious
But ain't nobody talking to a brother that's incomplacent, aye
Runnin' until he call us dawg
Like Adam we fallin' dawg
It is still he's callin' dawg
And sometimes we be stallin' dawg
And we run like an athlete at a track meet
And the patty on this packed beat like a back seat
You can catch me like a taxi on the back street
And the fact be I'm a black sheep
But God chooses to save us mayne
Pull us out and rep His name
Plus through Jesus He pleases to use us as His vessels mayne
Cats who wanna walk it and talk it
Teach it and preach it, they love it they live it
They'll go to wherever to reach 'em

[Chorus]
We kingdom people, we're willin' to repent, and cats that will rep the lord
Bondservants for His service, who who live to expect the Lord
We live to bless the Lord, 'cause we confess the Lord
Justfully, all we ever needed was just the Lord

[Verse 2]
In the midst of this disaster, bruh
He callin' for ambassadors
To hit the strip with a clique, spread truth on how he didn't pass the cup
But how He took the wrath for us
And out of love, He asked for us
But we ignore and pass Him up for the life of the night, that's blasphemous
Despite the fact sin's hazardous
Somehow it keeps on grabbin' us
Attracting us, dig tracks in us
And before we know it, it masters us
Man how does this happen, huh?
We never plan on actin' up
But could it you be lackin' love for the Lord who who stay and packed us up?
We're in the war, like Maximus
And discipline builds your character
The typical way we should live life, so men see Christ when they stare at ya'
No hocus pocus, magic wands
No one cares you're the pastor's son
Persevere through trials of this life, that's how we improve, pass it on
There's no time to be complacent
Let hope be your motivation
That's enough to spark a movement even in incarceration
On campus or in the hood
Stop limpin' off in the cut
Learn the word and spit it, bruh
Man, it's time we step it up

[Chorus]
We kingdom people, we're willin' to repent, and cats that will rep the lord
Bondservants for His service who who live to expect the Lord
We live to bless the Lord, 'cause we confess the Lord
Justfully, all we ever needed was just the Lord

[Verse 3]
Aye, first thing first, dawg, Jesus lives
Heaven, dawg, you bet is real
Reppin' Him till we dead and still
Or at least until the next appeal
Reaching for my people in the church, chillin'
All my kingdom people stand up
Men its time we hold it down and live it
Come on, dawg, 'cause we Christians
Men as a war and we missin'
We leavin' slack on our mission
And if you knew your position, dawg, you'd be out representing
Holding your bible and tract
Yelling revival is back
On the block, in the hood, boondocks, in the woods
Front troops, not idilin' back
Jesus, He died for us dawg
What more, we gotta trust God
Peter was bold in the Spirit and watched 3,000 trust God
And that same Spirit begot Him
Let's put the cross on the move
They should see more than our building
Let's get up out of the pews
Hope this is God in your view
God's with us, Emmanuel
If you with us, rep Him well
And if you not, time will tell
Dawg I don't play with no fire
Dawg I don't play cause it's hard
Rep His love, rep His grace
Shut this place down for the Lord

[Chorus]
We kingdom people, we're willin' to repent, and cats that will rep the lord
Bondservants for His service who who live to expect the Lord
We live to bless the Lord, 'cause we confess the Lord
Justfully, all we ever needed was just the Lord
