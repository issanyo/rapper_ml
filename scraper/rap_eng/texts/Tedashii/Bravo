Two... Ladies and gentlemen put your hands together please

Yeah, two claps as I applaud every saint who goin' hard
Catching heat; refusing to live discreet for the Lord
Yeah, and this the life, there ain't nothing better
Even in the trial and the error this the best thing ever
Wouldn't trade it for the world
That's how you lose your soul so I'm lettin' go of everything
Tryin' to take hold of abundant living whether in the streets or prison
Happiness forever and today, that's a given

And you need it for when times get hard
Oh Lord, people comin' sideways like my car
Yep, sittin' on chrome as if it was a throne
Makin' judgements from afar; doubleminded; two-toned
But in the moment baby that's where He is strong
You're powered by His power so you can keep movin' on
So this is for the saint who feels defeated by the hater
They come because of Him, but in Him you can take it

They want me to fail but I can't do that
Sometimes it gets hard, I already knew that
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]
Can I get a round of applause for the haters?
They can talk down but they won't ever shake us
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]

Embrace when them hate me, I already knew that
Yep, them fate, no escape, unless He do that
So two hands together for the ones who never let up
He said that it would happen so you can expect the pressure
He told us it would come, only a matter of time
And it's something I expected even after He died
People turned away from the One who can give them real life
Realize it's the truth, that's the reason they despise

Man it's [?], the fact that you chose to become a Christian
The Gospel is offensive, hard hearts barely choose forgiveness
And if they hated Him, what makes you any different?
It doesn't; man I pray to God that you listen
Count it all joy when the persecution comes
Celebrate, it's the proof that to Him you belong
Say He wrong, but it's truth, the Scripture said it's right
None above the Master, hey they gon' hate you if they hated CHRIST

They want me to fail but I can't do that
Sometimes it gets hard, I already knew that
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]
Can I get a round of applause for the haters?
They can talk down but they won't ever shake us
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]

Clap clap, bravo; clap clap, bravo
This is for the people in the pain and the sorrow
Clap clap, bravo; clap clap, bravo
This is for the haters who hate us 'cause who we follow
Clap clap, bravo; clap clap, bravo
This is for the people in the pain and the sorrow
Clap clap, bravo; clap clap, bravo
This is for the haters who hate us 'cause who we follow

They want me to fail but I can't do that
Sometimes it gets hard, I already knew that
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]
Can I get a round of applause for the haters?
They can talk down but they won't ever shake us
Bravo! (Bravo!) [x4]
