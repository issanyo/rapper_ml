[Pre-Hook: Alex Faith]
They say what a time to be alive
I told them look me in my eye
My squad so real, I can't deny
We everything that you not
Doing ain't been done before
They told us what we can become
Look at how I'm living boy
So tell me what is true now

[Verse 1: Alex Faith]
What a time to be alive
I've decided I'm done with the politics
My mind, eyes are focused in
I'm hoping in something better that is so legit
Drinking from the water, its living and I'm quenching
Never been another that described it like this
All the hunnads you can fit in 2 fists
Multiply by a thousand like He did it with 2 fish
5 loaves, mind blown, expanding flame
Lookin something like a Molotov
Keeping it a 100 like that out of bound
That ball room, no assassin player
Rhyme better but they fashion greater
I'ma make it plain, I am not a hater
But I'm calling out the bs when I see what they favor
My life is in these records, this is not entertainment
I'ma flip the scheme so let me tell you something
My shades on and my trunk is booming
I ain't climbing ladders boy I've been made
Go and ask the hood, I'm an innovator
Ask your momma and your cousin I can demonstrate
Everybody going up like an elevator
Shifting game like a commentator
When the chips down man I've been in favor
No change in the paint boy, I'm Steph with the 3
Fading everybody, comin like my name is Kyrie
Line em all up, nobody better than me
Well, I guess a couple others, maybe just like three
Ain't that for real or maybe did I
Prolly attack me in these lines, so I admit I
Put me down when they talk about me
But I'm feeling so alive in a time like this

[Hook: Alex Faith]
Everybody screwed up
Everybody two cupped
All the women you want
Who the real intruder
Everybody screwed up
Everybody two cupped
All the women you want
Who the real intruder

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I'm bumping it straight like its LA
I'm dropping my top like its LA
My crew, from the city, is with me
We tipping the valet, We ready to kick it like Pele
We off in the wind like an airplane
And I'm flying so high
No stanky dank, ain't even had a drank
Now you have it, I'm grown
You might have your glasses cleaned
Now this ain't a prank
And I'm ten toes in with no potion
But my potion something wavy like the ocean
But that notion, keeping these raiders at bay like Oakland
What a time to be alive
We ridin out, just me and mine
The team is fine cause we lookin for the things of fire
Flexing hard under pressure pushing beams of iron
Quench my thirst from this earth
Carried in a stream of wire
Taking life from a source keeping me alive
Sick of paradise, we took the scenic route
They can't keep me out
Taking my time now
Like in this time come
Cause there's no telling if I get another
Might need to just take me a time out
Coming from nothing, I'm out like something lately
Saying I maybe crazy baby
Maybe lately I'm the one that drives you crazy
Hit the spot and let's go and get it poppin
30 back tell em that is not an option
Trying to get you to the problem player
Burn is nothing if you want it man
Tell em I'm the king like Martin
Now we have at the Majors
Tell me there's motivation
Go through my life like vacation
But still keep it a lot like the matrix

Everybody screwed up
Everybody two cupped

Who the real intruder
Everybody screwed up
Everybody two cupped
All the women you want
Who the real and intruder
