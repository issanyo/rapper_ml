[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Homeboy!
When I walk, when I talk man it's more than just a show
This is life, reaf life, I'm not Truman that's fo' sho'
[?] loco at home, long distance, on the road
Overseas, around the globe, yep, that's just how it go
Oh! I keep runnin' but my legs feel weak
Feel like I'm gon' slip, this a trip; leg sweep
But give up, I don't know the phrase, get up like the Sonn was raised
That's just what I do since He got up from the grave
Goin' smart, arithmatic, do the math, watch it add up
Me and Him, that's a deal I couldn't pass up
Ay when I'm weak, He strong, ay when He right, I'm wrong
In Him I am too, man I knew that all along
So trust in Him, man His strength can go long
This call is too expensive, E.T. phone home
But He paid the bill, and put me on His plan
Now when I fall, when I ball, I get up by His hand

[Hook: Tedashii]
When we fall, GET UP!
'Cause this ain't all, GET UP!
It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP!
Stay on the grind, GET UP!
Ay all the time, GET UP!
Don't let it duke it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!

[Verse 2: S.O.]
Tedashii, what up? Leggo!
I tell 'em get up, don't snooze or sleep
Let up, why? Better strive
Head to the road that's narrow so you can see what I seen with better eyes
[?] your shadow feelin' your pain in a way that'll never die
Christ is [?] is easy as is televised
No, be strong in the grace that is found solely in He
Man, that spirit rose from the grave, it's safe to say
He lives in me
And you, indeed, stand with a truth [?]
Know that feelings could be lyin, so it's the Lion who
[?]
I said it's struggle gives grace, it's perseverence of the saints
It's only 'cause He holds [?] by His rope of love, but wait
There's more, in store, sanctification's taking place
[?] and you won't be in a perfect state 'til He returns
Til then we keep yearnin, learnin, discernin with
Sermons servin the powerful in the world [?] the person, we will do it
Our faith will not be ruined
And not in any case it's by His grace that we pursue Him

[Hook: Tedashii]
When we fall, GET UP!
'Cause this ain't all, GET UP!
It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP!
Stay on the grind, GET UP!
Ay all the time, GET UP!
Don't let it duke it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Oooahhh
So don't get lazy on my baby, uh uh, gotta keep it movin'
Train your body that's the aim like a 12 guage shotty
Stay focused, life is crazy, hold your ground, call it rudy
This is not a game, but you feel like you keep losing
And it's real man, but still it's so hard to understand
But we never practice Godliness, we get it where we can
That's weak, yeah that's weak and that's just how it's gon' be
You can train physically and still never have strength
Ay, hangin' by a thread, feelin weary and unstable
Look to Him who is strong, Kirk Franklin, He is able
He is God, we are not, we lazy and lack in faith
But you can persevere through it all; Imogo Dei

[Hook: Tedashii]
When we fall, GET UP!
'Cause this ain't all, GET UP!
It might be hard, but I gotta stand tall, GET UP!
Stay on the grind, GET UP!
Ay all the time, GET UP!
Don't let it duke ya, it'll pull ya to the ground, GET UP!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Knock him dowm, get him up!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
Ohhhh! GET UP!
