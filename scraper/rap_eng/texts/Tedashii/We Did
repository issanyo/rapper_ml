[Verse 1-Tedashii]
Ok, why did we do it? Cause mommy thought it was too late
The struggle in her flesh got her mixed up just like a Clue tape
She straddling the fence switching back and forth just like two lanes
So we present the grace that's available since this Jew came
Why did we do it?
Cause we deny the hand that was given
We'd rather prison before we choose the Lamb that is risen
We're unaware that our hearts are deceitfully wicked
If trusted it'll trick you like Shai Linne when he flipped it
So don't come up in the game tip toein'
Dip low when we blowin'
Tip slow and chill upon the fact men
Goin' through notions still jokin' imploding'
They lookin' up to God for props and more dollars
For collars for poppin, but it on a move
Yo crosses, cause lost men seek flossing like bosses
It's 116 the only reason I live
Make it plain like window panes and outfits without appeal
Yes I am young but like Vince I rally
I'm unashamed I stand out like Longhorns in Cali

[Chorus-Tedashii & Trip Lee:]
Because of God's love and grace - that's why we did what we did
For little kids up in the faith - that's why we did what we did
His Son died up in our place - that's why we did what we did
To meet the Father face to face - that's why we did what we did
To show them boys it's not an act - that's why we did what we did
Because the Christ is comin back - that's why we did what we did
To rep His name and hold it down - that's why we did what we did
We grab mikes and say it loud - that's why we did what we did

[Verse 2-Trip Lee]
Hey!
Cats always wanna ask us why we made a switch to livin life for the Master
Ain't nothing great as this
We don't be feelin like we have to be smoking and drinking Cris
They don't understand so they be asking why like Jadakiss
We used to be your average dudes man livin' just to live with ungodly attitudes
Straight content within our sin
But glory to God He snatched us up out of confusion, we ain't fools cause Christ cross shook us like we was hoopin' man
We ain't even know that our vision was blurred, was all up in the world but wouldn't get in the word
You wonder why we dirty south but ain't sippin' the syrup, cause He took the crucifixion still was risen on the third
His Spirit took control that's why we some new creatures
Taught us everything we know like He was a school teacher
Now we pursue Jesus we ain't livin' in sin, cuz He snatched us out the pit that's why we did what we did

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3-Tedashii]
Hey it's T-Dot, I'm back on your corner up in your hood man
Still reaching for them junky monkeys grippin the wood grain
Still reaching out to my family just like I should man
Even if they blow me off with it it's all good man
Cause the truth of the gospel I got it
Just like apostles I shout it
Loud like little kids who be pouting
Till this whole circle get crowded
See the world is undoubtedly cursed with a curse
So we spit a verse with no curse for the reverse of the curse
Children are fighting to live, addicts keep popping them pills, Christians are frightened to spill, passively croppin' them fields
I'm unashamed of the God who would take my blame, the lashes on the Master passed me fastly when Jesus came
So reading His Word- that's me, witness on curbs- that's me, no four letter words- that's me, does this sound absurd? That's me
See through what Jesus did, now we some believer kids, see it's His love that compels us to do what we did

(Repeat chorus)
