Yes, on a permanent team
You can say I'm fresh to death, I'm eternally clean
Used to walk to by own beat of drum
Internal instinct
But went from enemy to intimacy, I been redeemed
Through the cross and now I floss in His Paternal Regime
No more living single
Its like I done turned on Regine
In the body I got it
Wha-what fraternity means
He prevailed my hell so there will be no burning of me
So keep the urn and the wreath
Cause I'll return to the king
Accepted fully cause of the cross' conversion of me
So if I flex
It ain't in flesh
He bore my burden for me
And baby when I say I'm fresh
Its cause He birthed a new me

I'm fresh
Not because my swagger right
Not be-not because
Not be-not because my swagger right
I'm fresh
Cause He came and took the cross
I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross
I'm fresh
I'm fresh
Not because my swagger right
Not be-not because
Not be-not because my swagger right
I'm fresh
Cause He came and took the cross
I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross
I'm fresh

I'm fresh
Baby, cause of Adam #2
Crucified with Him
And by faith
Man He made me brand new
Point two
The cross was powerful in changing my view
Regenerate, all my boys say I'm acting brand new
And its true
So true
Cause I'm not what I used to be
Somehow I got this boost in me
Truthfully, I'm not used to me
Please believe me I'm humble
But in Christ I can boast
See it's grace through faith that got ya boy so cold
So cold, and I ain't trying to be cocky
No confidence in compliments, I know that's opposite godly
See conceit is not my stronghold
Confidence is strong though
Trust on high, and I don't mean that Cheech and Chong smoke

I'm fresh
Not because my swagger right
Not be-not because
Not be-not because my swagger right
I'm Fresh
Cause He came and took the cross
I can't floss unless my boast is in the cross
I'm fresh

To some this makes no sense but to others its krunk
So dawg I pray to God you feel this like them subs in ya trunk
Not just the beat
Although I know it's got you moving ya body
But the message in this song
It should be moving the body
Point one, I'm elected and redeemed
Point two
Cause I got a new position, I'm fresh, so clean
Point three
I'm the-I'm the best me that can be
I'm in His image so some sinner may just happen to see
That life is wasted if you shape it in the form of yourself
Or someone else besides the Son, the One who's form is this shell
So I'm reflecting your glory LORD
Man that's who I'm living for
Jesus is LORD so I ain't gotta please you

I'm fresh
