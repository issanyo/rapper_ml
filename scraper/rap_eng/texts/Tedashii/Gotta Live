[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Feliz]
Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
I've been down this road before
Now I know which way to go
You can try to drag me down
But I'll be living in the clouds
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now

[Chorus 1: Jordan Feliz]
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, I want it like I need to breathe
Yeah, make it clear like I need to see
As a kid, Momma told me sky's the limit
Til' you hit it like Ken Griffey to the fences
Out the park, hit and run, that's my drive
It's a vibe, been that way all my life
I shut it down, when I shine with the crew
Yeah I ride with the crew
Gave my life to the truth, testify
Walk on water like the Son of man
Understand I'll never drown
Take a hit and never quit
Might be down but never out
There are days that I fail
And the trains off the rail
Through the pain we prevail
Tell 'em you just gotta live

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Feliz]
Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
I've been down this road before
Now I know which way to go
You can try to drag me down
But I'll be living in the clouds
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now

[Chorus 2: Jordan Feliz]
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
You just, you just gotta live
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now
You just, you just gotta live

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Keep on living til' there's nothing left
Lean on we just like there's no one else
Ain't nobody out here more like You
And with you they broke mold
Ain't no more like you that for sure
I can't drop out like the top down on the coop
Tell 'em watch out when I walk out, make 'em move
Sunday morning with my hands up
Like they got the handcuffs
Searching for some answers
Since Momma passed from cancer and my sister left Seattle with a one way ticket home
Hope she holding Chase and teaching him to speak samoan
Gotta keep it going
Yeah that's all they told me
Tell him you can make it when you know the one and only

[Bridge: Jordan Feliz]
Burning bright beyond the fire
You were born to win, yeah, you're a fighter
Don't let your light just fadeaway

[Chorus: Jordan Feliz & Tedashii]
You just, you just gotta live
You just gotta live, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
You just gotta live
I just wanna live
He wants you to live
You just, you just gotta live
Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
You just, you just gotta live
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now
You just, you just gotta live, yeah
I just wanna live
