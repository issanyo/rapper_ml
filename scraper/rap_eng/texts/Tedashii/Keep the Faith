Grace and Peace, take a seat
Hey let's get into this man (1:1)
It's been a minute so lets get it because I'm amped on his name
Now as you all know
Paul wrote and said he couldn't wait to see us (2:17)
He said he tries but I quote, "Satan still impedes us." (2:18)
So until he can make it we read the letters he sends
That says he's not forsaken
Even when oppression begins (1:4, 5:23-24)
So lets begin with the fifth lesson for today and tomorrow
Cause Paul answers questions you have about today and tomorrow (Ch. 5)
And whether or not the Saviors coming back, today or tomorrow (5:2)
Instead of sharing the time/he exhorts us to pray and stay watchful (5:6)
It's easily seen like signs of a pregnant woman who shows (5:3)
And a thief in the night is surprise
If you're watching your doors (5:4-6)
So tomorrow's worries weaken when we're waiting with hope (5:8)
Anticipating his arrival keeps you ready for sho! (sure)
Lesson four can bring us more of an insight to this section (Ch. 4)
Especially when we start discussing the dead's resurrection (4:14-16)
Remember Paul wrote, those who are sleeping
That past on
Won't be passed over
So stop the grieving (4:16)
For if we believe in Jesus Christ and that He's still living (4:14)
We also believe He'll take those who are asleep as Christians (4:14)
So the topic of tomorrow is not my concern
Just the fact He's coming back and that He's soon to return (4:16)
Now with that on my mind/it makes today so crucial
Because the God who's coming back desires to live through you (1:5-6)

You took the word as it is
Let His love be fruitful in (1:6)
Your works of Faith and Love, so
Keep the faith (1:3)
It'll get a little harder
Yeah, yeah (2:2)
It'll get a little rougher
Oh Yeah (2:14)
But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)

Now I know you wondering how this affects us today man (4:13)
But you need the background to be effective today man
Do you remember lesson two when Paul called us his crown (2:19)
His boast before the Lord because we was holding it down (2:19-20)
Cause we heeded to the lessons that he taught to the crowd (2:13-14)
So much so
We all decided we would take our idols down (1:9)
And the news begin to spread fast all over town (1:8-9)
From our people to their people
In the towns that surround (1:8)
We proclaim the name of Jesus while we walking around
And it's crazy cause our neighbors started following us 'round (1:6-7)
Lesson 1 gives the reason why we all in this now
God predestined he would save this Thessalonians town (1:4)
He elected us for truth and Paul strolled into town (1:5)
Without the Gospel as a lifeguard we all would have drown (2:13)
In the sins of men and trends that be bogging you down (1:9)
We were homeless with no family like a dog in a pound (1:4)
Till God decided to go looking through the lost and the found (5:24)
And He spared us from His wrath that He'll be calling down (1:10)
Don't you get it?
We did, that's the reason why we miss him
Paul was like our father who taught us
All how to be Christian (2:11)
Like with the motherless
He nurtured us
And showed us his vision (2:7-8)
He loves us
That's why when he prays we're constantly mentioned (1:2-3)
So the call for us today is we continue his mission (4:10)
Long to lead a quiet life and to attend to your own business (lets get it)(4:11)

You took the word as it is
Let His love be fruitful in (1:6)
Your works of Faith and Love, so
Keep the faith (1:3)
It'll get a little harder
Yeah, yeah (2:2)
It'll get a little rougher
Oh Yeah (2:14)
But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)

Bridge:
There is joy in the firmness of your faith (3:7-9)
There is life in you embracing his grace (3:8)
So keep praying
And rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience
And just keep the faith (5:15-18)
There is hope in His return and that He will come (1:3,10)
There is peace in the promise of His love (5:23-24)
So keep praying
And rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience
And just keep the faith (5:15-18)

So in conclusion for today, I say
Continue in faith (1:3)
With love/Hoping in the day
The Lord will snatch us away (1:3)
Be an example for the saints that we find in Achaia (1:7)
Standing strong
No matter what
Reproducing the savior
Cause the joy of a teacher is when his students can grasp it
It's mastered
And we live on through you training up the masses (1:8)
And honor you leaders
In love
Appreciate their work (5:12)
Servant leaders making disciples as we create the church
Remember to exhort and comfort to alleviate the hurt (5:14)
And run from every form of evil to not deviate the church (5:22)
Though we imitate the saints and the God that we serve (1:6)
There are still great afflictions that can rattle your nerves
And this life will get so trife and it'll throw you a curve
And there are people who live evil
Feeding a sexual urge (4:5)
So be holy/living solely
For His glory (5:19-22)
Possessing your body rightly in the purity that he showed us (4:3-4, 5:22)
Cause no matter how much we grow
Or no matter how far we go
We still could do some more
Even if Timothy gave a good report (3:6)
So lets continue to work and labor
And endure in this race (4:1)
Eagerly hoping for the moment we will see His face (yeah)(1:10)

You took the word as it is
Let His love be fruitful in (1:6)
Your works of Faith and Love, so
Keep the faith (1:3)
It'll get a little harder
Yeah, yeah (2:2)
It'll get a little rougher
Oh Yeah (2:14)
But there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)
