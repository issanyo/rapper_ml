Intro
(Ah)
Big city living baby, fast car, fast nights, Everybody looking for a chance at the fast life
The fast lane but get swallowed by the city lights, Holla, the lights blind, (no sight)
Verse 1
Gripping the wheel sturdy turning with the earn burning
They looking for a chance to make it to the burn journey
For something difrerent credit life feel empty
I try to bring them Truth and an answer but they diss me
Diss me, diss me, in the class they dismiss me
Said they’ll pass but they fell so quickly
Wheels spinning faster going outta control
I’m tryna slow ‘em down and get them on the right road but....
Pre-chorus
Fast life living, they caught up and quit it
Tryna tell em something and they just won't listen
Try to change up their destination they might miss it
Going the wrong direction and that’s why I’m out on mission
CHORUS
Big city, living crazy, fast lane bracing
Going the wrong way ey ROCK A BYE BABY
This is how the sleepers say ROCK A BYE BABY
This thing might kill ya say ROCK A BYE BABY
Verse 2
I will tell it to the people that wanna know, if these people wanna go
Everybody here jus’ wanna blow, everybody here jus’ wanna show, show
But I won't give it to ‘em NAW
I’m tryna give them something di-ffer-ent and they say OWW
NAAW you ain’t get, you so dum, you should quit
Golden run, do it quick, you get none, money clip (Oh)
Paper game, jump a gun, jumpin in, jumpin out
