[Intro: Jenny Norlin]
Listen to the sound above
Hear the music from the sky
Oh, The day is near
Forever we be there
Heaven is a beautiful place
We will laugh until we cry
Feel the love we can't deny

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm only passing through; I can't keep still
I'm a stranger, that's for real
Evacuatin', this is not a drill
Alien baring fruit;
My crop circles and to feel I'm from a different world
Dwayne Wayne you remember
I even flipped my glasses no bartender
Mixed up in this crazy world keep the blender
Because I'm going back home and return to Sender, yea
But I knew that would
If He held it down for me then, then I knew that I could
Hey, as soon as he come back to get me hop in the corna'
You can call it graduation baby minus the diploma

[Hook: Jenny Norlin]
Raise your flutes to the truth
Have a toast on the new life
Every day we celebrate, we hope, anticipate
Heaven on our minds
No pain just pleasure
No sin just God forever
And ever
And ever
And ever
That will be the day

[Verse 2]
It. Is. Wonderful
And man no feeling can describe it
And even though I try to there's little that can define it
Any emotions like a potion be controlling me
Island Ocean living when these visions get a hold of me
Yea, interest to the King of kings
And I don't need a rosary
All I need is Him, Him, Him
Who I need?
The One that exist in Three
And not for me but for his glory
It's Him and not me He the star of this story
Heaven isn't heaven if God isn't there
If He isn't I don't want it might as well stay here
But we won't, that's my hope
I know that it gets better and we will be with God and we gone live forever
Like the song say, No sin enjoying Him for eternity

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jenny Norlin]
Beautiful vision
Our life as a mission
Love and perfection
And all our dreams will come reality
Face the joy for an eternity
Jesus Christ in full intimacy

[Hook]
