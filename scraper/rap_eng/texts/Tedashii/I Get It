[Verse 1: Tedashii]
I get it
In the gutter know the truth
Yeah, I know its all a game
On they mouth they leave 'em running
Reckless with all that you say
This ain't that frontin about what I'm gone do
This ain't that bragging about what I ain't got
One one six give'em something legit
Cause we sick of they lies!
Hold up, hold up
You say you a hustler in these streets where the proof?
Never talk about the real, how you more like Uncle Phil
Or maybe Will
Cause you actin like we in a movie
Baby I'm doing mine
Fully committed like I bought a ring!
Daily so often I'm down like a coffin
My life went down inside that box I am changed!
I get it like I've been enlightened
We bring the light and these suckers get frightened
Swinging at shadows, but swear they been fighting
(Ain't hitting at nothing!)
Ain't hitting at nothing
Trap stars, actors, going in circles like Nascar
I'm done drinking with you, serving baby this the last call!

[Hook]
Get it every night
Get it every day
I've been tryin to live
In every single way
So I really know
You don't really care
So what you trying to say
So what you wanna say?
(Woo!)
I get it, I get it!

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I'm from the spot that's screwed and chopped
Don't lean and lock, don't need the lights just need to knock
Got things to cop, A ring to watch
Look clean and sharp, ???
Every dreams for dudes where I'm living
Everybody saying that he did it like they snitching
Every vice for my people
Some advice for my people
They deceived us but it goes hand in hand
Like the cuffs on a policeman
Hold up, Hold up
You say that you standing on your on two
Bragging about who this all belong to?
But what you want baby ???
Getting paid like you runnin games
In some Jâ€™s yelling plays like you running game
Trying to regulate, on the regular
I be tellin her, yelling step it up
I'm only trying to bring out the best in us!
Man, I hope you get acquitted
Before you run up on those dudes who really live it
And find out what you doing ain't the fittest!
You selling lies to these kids about what you did
Like alarms in the morn I ain't trying hear it
Another victim to the system
Trying to save 'em, hope you listen
Somethings scarier than the prison
And the end is up!

[Hook]

[Outro: Tedashii]
Tell 'em they wrong
Tell 'em they wrong, I know better
Tell 'em I'm old
Tell 'em I'm old with no cheddar
Tell 'em I'm gone
Tell 'em I'm gone ??? level
???
All of 'em gone, we know better
Tell 'em they wrong
Tell 'em they wrong
Tell 'em they wrong
Tell 'em they wrong, I know better
