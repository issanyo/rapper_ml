[Intro: Elhae]
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to be
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Keep it 100 every time I'm on it
People been sayin' the way that you do it just ain't the same
Different than all of the rest
But I took a new path like I'm switchin' lanes
My people right here been lookin' for a change, oh Lord
We losin' our lives, and these brothers doing time, oh Lord
I called up the clique and they told me this it, man, let's switch it up
Change is so hard for these folk and they makin' it harder, I'm tensin' up
I'm feelin' like this
When they tell me man, "What you gon' do?"
I tell 'em like this, I'ma do it how He did, take two
Standin' on top of the table, I might just be doin' the haka
We bein' us and they makin' a fuss
But just know you can't stop us

[Hook: Elhae]
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be me

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I'm bein' me and I'm feelin' charged up
Feelin' so free like back in my condo
Get it today like I'm gettin' paid
You might not see we ain't ballers tomorrow
I get it today for people who're caged and feel like they caught up
Hol' up, hol' up, I'ma come down with it
Sick with it, doc, might need a shot
Take two of these and he'll call me tomorrow
They say nothing's easy, you gotta work harder
I'm feelin' milli like I won the lotto
I'm bein' me and that's the new motto
I'm bein' me man, and I'm the new model
To those takin' shots and they sayin' we've changed
He renewed my view and I'm takin' new aims
I'm here to win, again, again, until the end
No, I don't play games
No matter what happens I'm still unashamed

[Hook: Elhae]
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
All I ever wanted was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to be me
