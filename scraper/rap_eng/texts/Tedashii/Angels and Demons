[Hook: Crowder]
There's another world that I have concealed
Where Angels and Demons are constantly fighting over me
There's another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit
I know I can feel it
Lord comfort me

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Tears fall to the floor like TKO
Heartbreak cause of pain never seen before
Blood spills, I get chills, it's not even cold
From paradise to the leagues below
They after me, they chasin'
Friday the 13 like Jason
In the dash, my heart's been racin'
Back and forth, man, I been pacin'
I know this gotta be satan
I know this gotta be satan
Or maybe it's me I'm facing
God please send me an angel
Hard lease the police to arrest the thief
Tryna steal what's mine just to mess with me
Feels like I'm in a trial, are you testin' me?
Angels and demons, this stressin' me
Yeah, people swear that they blessin' me
Turns out to be the people that's vexing me
Till I rest in peace, I thought you were a friend
But the sin is, I begin
To Pretend that life's all about me
And these so called friends that take advantage of ya
Hate who you are, but swear they love ya
It's ready to get this brought to the open

[Interlude: Crowder]
Holy Spirit
Come, come, come, (x2)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
This ain't nothin' I ever did
Not really how I ever lived
I ain't tryna say I never slip
But I guarantee this, that the devil real
Never claiming that I'm blameless
That's a fact well known, like famous
I'm adjusting where my aim is
But off in the dark I'm shameless
Tryna drown my sorrow, and make it till tomorrow
It ain't a promise, man, it's just something I borrowed
And the truth hurts most, so we hold the a lot close
Side by side with another empty hope
And the devil keeps on comin'
I'm tired from the runnin'
It started out small, now this thing is enormous
(Huh?) and it keeps on callin'
Hard to take a stand when you keep on falling
But it feels so good, seems so right
If the dark this good I don't ever want the light
Forever want the night, cause it feels satisfied
Right behind closed doors, no relief in sight
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really don't want, but what I need make true
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really don't want, what I need make true

[Hook: Crowder]
There's another world that I have concealed
Where Angels and Demons are constantly fighting over me
There's another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit
I know I can feel it
Lord comfort me

[Interlude: Crowder]
Holy Spirit
Come, come, come, (x2)

[Outro: Crowder]
(Come, come, come, come, come)
(Oh comfort me, comfort me oh)
