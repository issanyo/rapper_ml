[Verse 1: Royal Ezenwa]
There's a problem dawg and I promise you don't even know it (know it)
Tryna live it good (good), you barely say you want it (want it)
Livin' for just the moment (moment), livin' life like you own it (why)
Price on your head dawg you really need atonement
I'mma make it clear the elephants now in the room (room)
Went today from here to die once in come [?]
That's the point I'm coming to
Really pray your listening close
Your soul gonna flow
When your body's in the [?]
Sin against the Holy God, standards are way to high
Falling short dawg ain't no way we getting by
Missed the mark five short but you don't even try
Romans 3 righteous deed just fieel the [?] right up in his eye
Sin brings death and gets between you and God (yes sir)
That's the problem the only one He can solve
When Jesus is the aim, hit the target lock and load
He can clean you up right, put you on that mop and glow

[Hook: Tedashii] (x2)
Washed in Christ's blood
And shinin' bright I'm on that mop 'n glow
Shinin', shinin' bright I'm on that mop 'n glow, mop 'n glow
Washed in Christ's blood, wash, washed in Christ's blood, blood
And shinin', shinin' bright I'm on that mop 'n glow, mop 'n glow

[Verse 2: J. Han]
A while back, when I wasn't on that mop 'n glow
It was '99, pockets full of [?] and drole
Livin' out a mobster role
Perp blow rhyme slow
'Til I got exposed to His fire
Stop drop and roll
I lived the part of delivered like Domino's
Catch me jumping in the tank like Geronimo
They say faith and confession, these points are certain
Believe and be baptized to point conversion
I'm at the point of [?]
Magic the way that I'm serving (dish)
All of my life and all of my knife to the point it's working
The blood of the Lamb converted me like currency
Crossed over belly flopped in the burgundy (splash)
Soda cans in this life they not concerning me
I'm Lazarus back from the dead so what could worry me
Your boys a candle stick like where the [?]
Young Moses switch the clean I got the diamond [?]

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Royal Ezenwa]
If you ever sinned homie you's a slave to it
John 8:34 everybody was falling prey to it
Jesus gave His life (life)
Upon His back (back)
To the cross
Took our sin in exchange gave us righteousness, I must be born again
The Holy Spirit, He's the only way to see life
Once blind, faith in Christ the only way to see right
Now I get to see light
I'm no longer enslaved
I'm amazed
Blown away
The ransoms before me, paid
He died a death we couldn't die
Take it there we couldn't [?]
[?] we ain't deserving we got [?] through His grace
That eternal life through Christ
I promise He's the only way
The solid Rock all other foundation fades away
He's the potter, I'm the clay
We will make the seekers [?]
[?] pursuit of the Lamb of light
That's eternal waste
It's only by faith we blameless in God's sight
Isiah got turned to Christ please don't waste your life

[Hook] (x2)
