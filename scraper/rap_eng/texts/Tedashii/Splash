[Intro]
Mashell was cookin' a beat
Splash, splash
Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Ooh I’m too lit, watch me hop up out the grave
Yeah, they too scared to swim while we making waves
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Hey, I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Necessary everything ain't necessary
Legendary, my clique on that legendary
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Watch me make a splash, I can make a splash

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
I jumped out the whip tho
That song, that’s my tempo
Payback, that’s my Venmo
H-Town with my kinfolk
Hits big like a Mack truck
Tell these haters back up
You don't want a problem
Do the math, that don't add up
Nowadays, I got a fraction of my patience
For the foolish, please don't do it, keep your day shift
Hold up
Came up from the asphalt
Now we cruise we bout to cast off
Resurrect, we 'bout to blast off
Know we killed it cause the mask off
Red like a diamond drippin, we gon' make a splash
Houston strong till I'm gone, tell 'em that's the facts

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Ooh I’m too lit, watch me hop up out the grave
Yeah, they too scared to swim while we making waves
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Hey, I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Necessary everything is necessary
Legendary, my clique on that legendary
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Watch me make a splash, I can make a splash

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I ain't come to flex, no
I just got a check, though
I came from the jects to own the jet
What you expect son?
I have a dream, rep the King like Doctor King
Where you want to come up from your knees
All you want is to succeed
Message to the ceiling, Heaven how I livin'
Bad, like a villain
Michael Jackson, I'm the thriller
Meant to be, whoa
They intimate, whoa
They temptin' me, whoa
Guess they interest me, yah
I can't pay that cost, yah
I got used to free, yah
They say that we blind, naw man you finna see
Got a Queen, got a team
Blowin off a little steam
Just a dab, that's a splash, make a mark that never leave

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Ooh, I’m too lit, watch me hop up out the grave
Yeah, they too scared to swim while we making waves
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Hey, I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Necessary everything is necessary
Legendary, my clique on that legendary
I just made a splash, I just made a splash
Watch me make a splash, I can make a splash

[Outro: Tedashii]
Came up from the bottom yeah
I can make a splash now yeah
I came from the bottom yeah
No, I won't fold right yeah
Came up from the bottom yeah
I can make a splash now yeah
I came from the bottom yeah
No, ain't no coming down now

[Outro 2: 1K Phew]
I'm too lit, watch me hop up out the grave
