You try to bury my flame, I'll tell you to fire away
Without a shadow of doubt no you
Can't put my fire out
Can't put my fire out
Can't put my fire out
Can't put my fire out
I'll tell 'em fire away
Fire away, fire away
I'll tell 'em fire away
Can't put my fire out

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
OK, if life's a game
I'm the referee
I'll give you some and keep the rest for me
All in my mix like a recipe
Free like the cops almost arrested me
Might be a little off, no correcting me
Go straight across like intersections please
He's directing me
So till I Rest in Peace
I plan to keep the plan, what you expect of me
I took a blow like Tyson's punch
And I feel like Job, was he out to lunch
Was this the plan, Is it in His hand
I don't understand
What does He really want
Oh well no fail, I might not never know
This life frail, but it sever slow
So until He cuts me off I ain't letting go
My fire gone burn forever more

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
They say you acting like he ain't save you
Saying it's love 'cuz they claim to
But be careful dawg cause they'll play you
You don't know my pain, you don't my shame
You don't know my life cause you know my name
Heard my songs and heard me sang
You don't know dawg, I don't play them games
You don't know how bad it hurt when nobody ever tries to say his name
No excuse but I refuse to pretend for you, and do it all in vain
Who I'm fronting for
Who I'm stunting for
Go ahead and cry dawg when it's hurting bruh
Down to the core
When my heart is sore
While I try to let my fire burn for ever more
Man, cuz I feel it, yeah life got a bite and it's mission intended is to try to take me out
I feel it, I get it, like rhythm I'm moving, forget it, ain't losing
I'm running and gunning because He would choose me
For this pain, yeah, every strand of my body been feeling the strain, yeah!
Even People telling me to leave Him, believers or even speaking opposite of what I believe in
It's getting harder for me to maintain, yeah
Why me!
Why me!
Who know
God sees
He knows the hurt I felt for sure
He can relate, that's the reason he's great
Every move he makes, never made a mistake
So no matter my fate
I'm in till the end
From begin my intent was to say please send Me
And I'll be on my way
My haters gone hate
But you can tell 'em all to fire away!
