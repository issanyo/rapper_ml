[Intro: CASS]
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O' Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels

[Chorus: CASS]
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, Tdot
We adore Him, let's adorn Him
Jewels shine in the light, we need more of Him
Can't afford it, but He paid it all
Family gathered around the fire sipping eggnog, yeah
And everytime that we spend time
That's the feeling of a lifetime
I wish that I could rewind
But we still got right now
Right now, toast to the Savior
Momma said He came and took my mess like a manger
Falling for the curves, I was foul to the change-up
When the homie brought me home and out the park, it's major
So keep going, it ain't over
His love brings us closer
O' come and adore the new life here for me and you

[Chorus]
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him

[Verse 2: CASS]
Can't wait to make new memories
No stress hanging over me
We got love, let it cover me
All I need is what's in front of me
Yeah, it's a moment I've been waiting for all year
What joy it brings me
To kneel before the King

[Verse 3: nobigdyl.]
Got the joy that you feel inside
I've been waiting all year just to get it right
Yeah, think the angel's gon' sing with me
And my baby put something under the tree for me
Yeah, all of that frustration I let it go (Let it)
We can turn missiles to mistletoe (Mistle-toe)
We can make family out of foes
It's funny He'll take the sun and turn the rain into snow like

[Chorus: CASS]
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him
O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him

[Outro: Tedashii]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Head bowed with my hands high
Froze, waiting for His time, tell Him standby (Standby)
He changed the world, that's a landslide (Landslide)
God meant for all mankind (Mankind)
I've been waiting for this all year (All year)
Got my family and they all here (All here)
And they all here (All here)
Come and see while we all here (All here)
