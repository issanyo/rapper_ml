[Verse 1: Tedashii]
You don't know what I've been through
Lost it all and my rent's due
Trouble, when it rains it floods
In my pain no it ain't all good
No but I tell them this
I'm a witness
That everything is made new
So tell em' dawg I ain't through
Feels like feels like this life just became a fight
Yeah I'm in it they know it
I know pressures on me
Yeah there's pressure on me
But tell em who ain't crack homie

[Hook: Trip Lee]
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
OK life, for most, we know that this is not paradise
But we swear it's tight when she wear it right
I feel the heat it's Miami Vice
It's the rest in me to get the rest of me
You start burnin for that but ain't no turning me back
That's pressing me and they testing me
To see me fail and give me Hell so I'd be burnin in that
Yeah right, life is an island which means we trapped in that
But we cool cuz the view so nice and lax
And like we don't feel the pain cuz' of laughing gas
But one blast of that and you forget that this pain is real
Yeah but no matter how good that feel
Man this pain is a thing that kill
Man I heard that so I swerve back
Curve that so let me curve back
Every time I feel that urge back
We crossing paths where we merge at
It drives me crazy but lately
Man I feel like I can make it
Just last year I couldn't take it
And this strength man I can say this

[Hook: Trip Lee]
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

[Bridge: Trip Lee]
Might walk on water
I won't lose a step
Got-gotta go hard
But I ain't gotta do it myself
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
Feelin like I can't lose
There ain't nothin' I can't do

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Hold up
What you said? All that fame done gone to my head?
Like that same power that save me
Can't raise me from the dead
They get me reading thinking bout keeping peace
While I'm raging war on myself
I'm feeling myself then I'm killing myself
I'm sipping on blood and I'm chewing on flesh
Just chill out we don't want to hear that mess
All that 'won't do that' & 'I can't do this'
Pain, death, hurt, hate we done been through this
And I'm sure there's plenty more that I ain't been through yet
But I don't care though, bring on the heavy metal
I got a power living in me that'll never settle
Never leave nor forsake I'm a bleed never break
I'm a die come back with the keys to the safe
Gotta keep sitting deep for the things that I face
Can't erase God's ink wait clean with the paint
And I'm stained in it when the pain hit me
I withstand anything that you bring to me
They love to tell me what I can’t do faithfully
They love to tell me what I can’t do faithfully
They love to tell me what I can’t do faithfully
I'm coming back from the dead what you saying to me
I can't do

[Hook: Trip Lee]
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

[Bridge: Trip Lee]
Might walk on water
I won't lose a step
Got-gotta go hard
But I ain't gotta do it myself
I can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do
Feelin like I can't lose
There ain't nothin' I can't do
