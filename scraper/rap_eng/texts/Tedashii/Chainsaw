[Intro: Soul Glow Activatur]
Yeah, they like the way I do this
When I crank it like a chainsaw
Yeah, they like the way I do this
When I crank it like a chainsaw

[Verse 1: Soul Glow Activatur]
Full throttle, heavy metal
Set the bar, next level
Wasteland, gettin' all janky
Soul Glow (chainsaw)
Lay in the cut with them elbows back
Engine smokin' just like this track
Shirt be soakin' from all this sweat
Catch my breath (chainsaw)
Now hear me roar, I'm an apex predator
From the sycamores, let's get Skeletor
(Ch-ch-ch-chainsaw, chainsaw)
Wa-watch and learn, watch and learn
Get that thang crankin', yeah, slash, slash, burn

[Hook: Soul Glow Activatur]
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back
Crank it, crank it, back, back
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back, back
Crank it, crank it back, back

[Post-Chorus]
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it like a chainsaw, chainsaw

[Verse 2: Crouton]
Fresh flannel shirt, country bumpkin
Lumberjack your moves, a.k.a. Paul Bunyan
Run yun yun-yun-yun yun-yun-yun yun-yun
I make it run, I make it run, I make it run, run  (chainsaw)
Drop it, dro-dro-drop it, dr-dr-dr-dr-drop it down low, low
Chop it, chop, chop it, chop, here we, here we go, go
Teeth so sharp that they're callin' me Jaws
I'm your boss, baby, crank it like a chainsaw (chainsaw)

[Hook: Soul Glow Activatur]
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back
Crank it, crank it, back, back
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back, back
Crank it, crank it back, back

[Verse 3: Fatty]
Chained out (chained out), head hunter (head hunter)
Cyberpunk, yeah, I'm a blade runner (blade runner)
Turned up (turned up) automatic (automatic)
Full tank, you ain't gotta think about it (chainsaw)

[Verse 4: Tedashii]
Chainsaw
Yank it, crank it, swank it
Then you put it inside whatever you ride
Turnin' all the way up and hear you crank it it
Chopped the block no ginsu
Wilderness but I'm chivalrous
From Texas but no massacre
Unless it's a beat, we killing it
Chopping down trees, can't you see
Watch 'em things fall
Bows to my knees, that mean
I crank it like a chainsaw
Do it, do-do-do, it til these trees all see these flames y'all
Burn 'em up now burn 'em down
Now let me see you chainsaw

[Hook: Soul Glow Activatur]
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back
Crank it, crank it, back, back
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Bows to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it, crank it, crank it back, back
Crank it, crank it back, back

[Outro]
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it like a chainsaw, chainsaw
