Folks having hard times
Living in the world so cold
Life dealt them cards now
People trying hard not to fold
Pressures their heart now
Feels like they bout to explode
While feeling down they asking, "Is this the life that I chose?"
It seems so unfair
Man we just trying to survive
But its like no one cares
We living life just to die
And when I come share
That Jesus cares about your life
Their heart is hard, they disbelieve
And they filled with too much pride to cry out
LORD
I surrender my all, or cry
LORD
Will you answer my call
Cause this life is not easy
God why I gotta be me
It's hard for me to trust cause when I do somebody leaves me
See, life without Christ is not life, it's daydreaming
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

Hook:
Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe

LORD peep the hood child
Rocking Ones with an ice grill
Folks say he should smile
His mug's mean cause life is
He wants that good life
A caddlac truck with nice rims
And the culture says to get it live like the thugs live
A hustlers ambition
Since the day he was born
I wished it was different
Is this place really the norm
So when I go witness
God's forgiveness seems foreign
And his heart is dark, he disagrees and he's filled with too much scorn to cry
LORD
Will you take me as I am or cry
LORD
Can you make me a new man
Cause this life is so greasy
God why I gotta be me
Why can't I be that dude I saw rapping on the tv
Questions by some who blind to the grace that freed me
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe

This world is gone pass away
So LORD my prayer is they get it
Your could probably come back today
And a lot of these folks just might miss it
Caught up in their worldly ways
Not knowing they could change in an instance
It just takes faith to get in this
But it's been replaced by religion
So cats remain blind
Thinking that their works just might save
Some just stay high
Thinking there's no way you would take 'em
Saying it's a hard life
Complaining when I go witness and
I ask them, what if God did this so He could get your attention
So you'd cry
LORD
I confess and believe
Or cry, LORD
I see it's you that I need
Cause change is so hard
And life is mean in these streets
And it seems there is no God
But see since Adam and Eve
Mankind is so lost
Confused on the path they should walk
And so...
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and Day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
Everywhere I go its still the same song
Everybody ge tting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
