Since before I was a notion to be complete and even before Vera and Victor would speak to meet
God predestined that the days I would hit the street
In a dorm on my own I would seek for peace
Then God showed up, and like the old folks say, "He showed out"
Gave me my grace plus peace and left no doubt
Its on now, I'm a new creature
The old is gone now
Instead of all that Jeezy its Jesus Musik that's on now
Switched, my affinities
Died to my amenities
And told all my partners I'ma live for infinity
I changed my allegiance with more than a pledge
And told all my boys stop mourning the dead(me)
I'll forever serve the Lord because He
Took that cross
Seem to lose all my boys but I took that loss
Cause who's my mother or my brother but the ones in Christ
And since the Lord decided to give us all one more night, then I'ma

Carry Mine
Cause I believe He's God in the flesh
I carry mine
He's the one that gave me my breath
I carry mine
Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned
Living for the Lord has eternal reward
So I'ma carry mine

Turning from the lies that you heard that this world is better
Like 2nd Kings 7, sharing good news like the four lepers
That, this world is gone pass away
And we live in the last of day
Christ is the way to get pass the gate
Idolatrous men get snatched away
See man can gain the whole world but
Dog to what benefit
Cause I promise you lose your souls investment at the end of it
See His rejections our blessing
We stressing the lesson
The Fathers acceptance of the rejected demands perfection
To stand in and then
Bare the brunt of man's sins
Cause He transcends man's trends so they call us mad men
But we ain't crazy we crunk
To give Him praises we pumped
Cause He ain't count equality with God a thing to be clutched
Instead died and rose on the 3rd
I went and opened His word
My eyes were opening up
Throw your hands in the air and surrender your life
And put your hands to the plow
Now, shout it loud dog
That I'ma

Carry Mine
Cause I believe He's God in the flesh
I carry mine
He's the one that gave me my breath
I carry mine
Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned
Living for the Lord has eternal reward
So I'ma carry mine

Dog don't get it twisted
This a call to discipleship
Losing your life
That's the call a disciple gets
Daily
Following the scriptures of God
Getting intimate with intent as you listen to God
Da-Da-Daily
Down to crucifying your flesh
Forsaking worldly ambition cause He's supplying your blessings
See God hip me to his Son and I confessed like Peter
Revelation He's giving to end the beef like Ether
A passion so perfect I wanna spell it out like Retha
Who?
He took the cross and not a crown like Ceasar did
When errbody and they momma was yelling out who they thought He was
He was in the cut
Training up His disciples cuz
Giving them the proof of the truth that He would have to die
And the elders, chief priest, and scribes all pass Him by
Luke 9, who now
Down to rep and walk it out
Is it me, is it you
Matters not dog cause I'ma...

Carry Mine
Cause I believe He's God in the flesh
I carry mine
He's the one that gave me my breath
I carry mine
Truth hit ya boy like a shot to the chest, I learned
Living for the Lord has eternal reward
So I'ma carry mine
