[Intro: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, they ruin the view, you watching this
Say, I'm doing a fool and it's obvious
Say, I'm losing it too like property
They ruin my mood with this gossipin'
Hating this, in the heat of the moment where Satan is
Accusing me of nothing that’s a bait and switch
Making this, hard for a person in this place to live
My God, I’m working like I ain’t got nothin'
Carry a load you might drop something
And you can’t hide so stop frontin'
I got it, that's a lie that we tell ourselves
Then I guess that its hard for you to ask for help
But in that moment that's when you fail
One slip and they judging
With a standard like they ain’t done nothin'
I make no excuse but I refuse to lose
To some dudes with no clue of what I’ve been through
From where I’m coming, no lie I should’ve been done in
I’m working at it I ain’t perfect at it and I say this every time

[Chorus: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I'm suppose to be dead and gone in a catacomb like Rome
Out of range trying to use my phone, Hello
No tone, left alone like I lost my arm
But I’m up by the air like the top of your home
With a birds eye view
Watching these people saying words not true
Accusing me, they abusing me, yeah truthfully
I don’t have the time to be worried about you man
Man Nawl, Oh Lawd
People playing games with no ball
No rules in this so they losing it
And they don’t know the score at all
Consider my life they don’t
Believe me I’m only human, they won’t
But no matter their lies
I won’t compromise
Everyday for your boy it’s on
Man I promise, I’m honest
I shoot ‘em straight but they really don’t want it
Ya they taunt me then flaunt it
I’ve been dealing with this for the longest
Ya I doubt I’m the strongest
But in Him when I am weak I’m stronger
I’m working at it, I ain't perfect at it
And I say this every time

[Chorus: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Bridge: Kam Parker]
My shoes ain't your shoes
So don’t try to judge me
Just deal with your issues
Take a look in the mirror
What you judgin’ for?
Take a look in the mirror
Cause you never know
How you affect the next person with your comments

[Chorus: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
