Let's go! (oh [x16])
You know what it is
See them hands, let let let me see them hands
You know what it is
See them hands, let let let me see them hands

Let me see them hands to the sky like this a stick up
Yeah we goin' onward and nobody sippin' liquor
I'm fresh, brand new, man, somebody take a picture
I'm feelin' so official, throw the flag, blow the whistle
Set it off, blow it up, but, but you can keep the missile

Grace through the mediator, my [?]
[?] in the middle
Through Him we get the "W" so you can call me winner
Yes sir, gave the Lord control, command, shift, enter
Some aimin' for the stars, most drive a mini-missile
Man, I'm aimin for the Lord, through the Son, that's how we get em'
This is more than just some music, it's a movement, see the Scriptures?
'Cause I'm pride in the Lord, but humble since my beginning

Humbled from the start
My pride is in the cross
Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off
Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Hey

The Father's who I follow, he runs it out like a Cannon
Tryin' to bring you out the dark, somebody turn the flash on
So you can get the picture, He's the reason you ain't passed on
He's gracious plus He's patient, He hates it when one is passed on
Not over, it ain't over, roger that, come back now over
Pride'll kill ya, lies'll kill ya, gassed up like Exxon-Mobil
Get you lookin at yourself just like Face Off with John Travolta
Watch it - pride'll have you tryin' to network and netflirt like Oprah

Hey, but I'm humbled by the Cross, for real
Somebody tell Ross I know who the Boss, for real
Pride leads you to destruction, get you lost, for real
But the humble in Him can boast in Him - floss, for real

Humbled from the start
My pride is in the cross
Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off
Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Hey

Now you might wanna lean with it, might wanna rock with it
Might wanna do the Superman, or Cat Daddy, Dougie, pop and lock with it (Go'n and get it)
On that Psalm 30: 11, I know my God did it (Gotta dance)
Ain't no pride in it, (walk and talk)
You know the Rock's in it
I know we're loco with the dudes that don't flow
My bros in dark clothes [?] with the Lord, it's top [?]
You hear these lines and hooks? Homie, we fishermen - we preach
Watch this Gospel network, gettin' good reception with 3Gs
Our souls are so low to behold the Lord of hosts
To know, conozco, don't wanna go until you know
I'm safer than Noah when the flood came, homie, I rejoice
His cross is beyond the arc, he nailed it - three points

Humbled from the start
My pride is in the cross
Victory is mine, I'm working for the boss
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Yeah we do it big, we 'bout to set it off
Victory is mine, my pride is in the cross
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
You know what it is, now lemme see them hands up
Hey
