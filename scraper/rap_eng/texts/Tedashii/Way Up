[Chorus: Tedashii]
Oooou, I don't mean to boast now
We just hit the wave like its the coast now
When we leave your city, turn your city to a ghost town
Turn the music up, cause it's going down
And we ain't slowing down

I don't mean to boast now
We just hit the wave like its the coast now
When we leave your city, turn your city to a ghost town
Turn the music up, they know that it's going down
We ain't slowing down

Who are we afraid of? fraid of
Who are we afraid of? fraid of
We gon take it way up, way up
We gon take it way up, way up

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yo, Northside chaplain
H-Town accent
Faith that ain't hard to see
Won't boast in my works but no Hidden Figures, Taraji P

Endure the odds, been through it all
Bet against me, then you might lose it all
Giants are tall, but my God is taller
Give me the rock, shoot ya' shot, watch 'em fall
Going home like way way way up
Out on road on my way wait stay up

You know the plan, I know the plan
Faithful we live it as long as we can
Here for your good, that's 'til I'm gone
Yeah, that's the brand

One judge only
Faith no phony
Tell' em show me, overcoming, testimony

Me and my crew, we stay covered in red
Ain't in no gang but we in this forever
Gave Him my life and we do it to death

[Chorus: Tedashii]
I don't mean to boast now
We just hit the wave like its a coast now
When we leave your city, turn your city to a ghost town
Turn the music up, they know that it's going down
And we ain't slowing down

Who are we afraid of? fraid of
Who are we afraid of? fraid of
We gon take it way up, way up
We gon take it way up, way up

[Verse 2: KB]
Yo, look
Southside Rabbi
Might get baptized
I am too passionate
Throw me under the bus
But I will not sit in the back of it
Hear the snickers in the stands, Yeah
I hear the snickers in the stands, Yeah
These rappers says hungry
Satisfied sunny/You won’t get concession stand, Bruh
Zealot zealot my hand, Up
No joke, but we stand, Up
Threw the “X” on our plans, Yeah
But we talking expansion
We in and out of college
Bout it bout still screaming knowledge
My “Yale” tough
I ain’t scared to fail, Bruh
Fail, Bruh

[Half-Chorus: KB]
I don’t mean to boast now
We just hit the wave coast now
When we leave your city turn your city to a ghost town
Turn that music up, cause it’s going down
And we ain’t, Aye

[Chorus: Tedashii & KB]
I don't mean to boast now
We just hit the wave like its the coast now
When we leave your city, turn your city to a ghost town
Turn the music up, they know that it's going down
And we ain't slowing down

Who are we afraid of? fraid of
Who are we afraid of? fraid of
We gon take it way up, way up
We gon take it way up, way up
