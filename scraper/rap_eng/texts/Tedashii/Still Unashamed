[Sample]
We are not ashamed
Of the Gospel of Jesus Christ

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
In this game you can claim anything and they can't say nothin' (so hard, so hard)
So hard that ya bars might blow a couple brains with a button (pull triggers, pull triggers)
Pull triggers, push dope, them figures might double up, stuntin' (uh huh)
Can't nobody tell bruh nothin' (uh huh)
But talkin' 'bout the Lord is goin' too far? How funny
Hey, can I get another one? Heatin' up
NBA Jam, on fire, deep in us
Goin' hard like the score might even up
But it won't, Too Cold, I'm sleevin' up
Why be ashamed, we seen enough
He was bleedin', no breathin' and beaten up
Ain't got no reason to leave Him, I'm sold
He bought my soul, He picked this light-skinned heathen up
Celebration's best when we got grace we rest in
Hey, the groom He stepped in
Now everyday's a reception

[Hook]
Still gotta serve my God, no lie
Still Unashamed
On the mic I might testify, oh my
Still Unashamed
Tear down what we got so high, they try
Still Unashamed
Love what got here, glad that we got here, nah it won't die

[Post Hook]
Hey the clique back, sit back
Been a long wait, this that
This that 116 rap, you know what it is
Hey the clique back, sit back
Been a long wait, this that
This that 116 rap, still unashamed

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I am so, I am so
Unashamed, unashamed, squad we still running mayne
Unalarmed, unaffected, we still unabated
I get it like andale, andale
No no, we cannot be quiet
Yeah the clique back, but we not violent
While the killers sitting on the side silent
But you know ya boy known to start a riot
Been a minute since we did it, baby here we go
Tell it real how it is when we live low
For the crew, nothin' new, mission isn’t old
In ya hood out in Texas, where we ride slow (ride slow)
Out in Dallas at the classic, riding classy, tall tees to my knees
And the team on that one sixteen, you know how it go
And I’m still workin', while you still lurkin'
And I’m still lit, so you can’t burn me
Man, I’m so determined, yeah, you can’t deter me
Still here until they close the curtain

[Hook]
Still gotta serve my God, no lie
Still Unashamed
On the mic I might testify, oh my
Still Unashamed
Tear down what we got so high, they try
Still Unashamed
Love what got here, glad that we got here, nah it won't die

[Post Hook]
Hey the clique back, sit back
Been a long wait, this that
This that 116 rap, you know what it is
Hey the clique back, sit back
Been a long wait, this that
This that 116 rap, still unashamed

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
In the game you can be unashamed 'bout anything
More dope, more coke, more killin' man
Our favorite's when we get degraded, it’s really strange
You should be on the D-List, if you wanna talk bout Jesus
Boy, I’m finna state my thesis
They want me to love Him in secret, like they do side pieces
Let me see them hands in the air right now
116 if you here right now
Some say we changed, we don't care right now
Chasin' cash like we in a bad love affair right now
Well let me give the rumors Sudafed right now
And put 'em all to bed right now
Got this red wine, call this communion
Yes, I am tryna get this bread right now (just playin')
I know some people erasin' our names, say we vacated our claims
And I’m like, “Well, it is 10 years later; we changed"
We ain't take paper and trade it for shame
We took our time navigatin' our lanes
When we made mistakes, we should take all the blame
But we still unashamed of the same name
Shoot for the sky, baby, bang bang
And we ride with the same gang
Nothin' but the blood from the same veins
Not guilty's the picture, you can't frame us
I'm cool if I'm faithful but ain't famous
I'm cool if I'm faithful but ain't famous

[Outro]
Yes sir, One One Six
