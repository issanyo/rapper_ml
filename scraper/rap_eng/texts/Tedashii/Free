[Pre-Hook]
Everybody cool, ain't nobody tripping when you 'round me
We just came to party, it's a party everywhere that I be
Can't nobody hold us back all down must be
Cause we doing whatever we wanna
Good God I'm free

[Hook]
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm free
I told y'all, I'ma be me
I'm keeping that line on repeat
Run it back like I’m Adrian Pete
Drop down the top and let down all my hair
Wind in face like I don't have a care
They throwing that shade, they throwing grenades
But why would I change, the party's right here
Get it all like a rich man
Trying to get the upper hand like a wristband
Life'll throw you for a curve, I’m just trying not to swerve
Trying to stand on my own without the kickstand
These nit wits they’ll nit pick my living it's sickening
Can't get wit this ignorance my defense like a pick six is instant
I'ma take it to the house baby, prime time

[Hook]
Everybody cool, ain't nobody tripping when you 'round me
We just came to party it's a party everywhere that I be
Can't nobody hold us back all down must be, cause we
Doing whatever we wanna good God I'm free

[Pre-Hook]
Everybody cool, ain't nobody tripping when you 'round me
We just came to party, it's a party everywhere that I be
Can't nobody hold us back all down must be
Cause we doing whatever we wanna
Good God I'm free

[Hook]
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like

[Verse 2]
Living life, moving forward
Yeah, that’s a pick and roll
A new day, a new story
Tell time I'm moving on, yeah
Feels like a holiday
Change coming, I can see it from a mile away
Got the sun shining on me, this a brighter day
Chunk a deuce to these blues, then it's andale
Having a ball
Like taking these snaps man and handing them off
Trying to make freedom a habit for y'all
Tell 'em I need it like having withdrawals
You can tell it by the way we live, yeah
Tell it ain't a thang that we did, yeah
Tell it came in only by Him, yeah
Telling anyone who gon hear it, yeah
Party with me
Riding my wave no way I'm a miss it
If this offensive, then please forgive me
Feeling so free man I got to live it like, ooh!

[Pre-Hook]
Everybody cool, ain't nobody tripping when you 'round me
We just came to party, it's a party everywhere that I be
Can't nobody hold us back all down must be
Cause we doing whatever we wanna
Good God I'm free

[Hook]
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm free
I’m being me
And if they can't see tell 'em c’est la vie
Flexing on 'em, no competition
Going hard, no opposition
This was written, no composition
If you with that then say it all when me
Like, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Like, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Like, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Like, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free

[Hook]
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like
Show you what it feel like, show you what it feel like

[Outro]
I’m free
