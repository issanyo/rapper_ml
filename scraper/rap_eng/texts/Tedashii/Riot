[Verse 1]
Riot, I said everybody riot
Tell 'em if they won't come try it
I mean make war everybody fight it (fight it)
Done with them secrets, yep I ain't keepin' quiet
They say this won't hurt me, they lyin'
They just tryna murk me, slowly I'm dyin'
Lied, they lied now they tryna bury us pride, my pride
Choke button, it's a slaughter house
Tryna hold on, but it's hard screamin' oh-oh-oh my god WHOA
Slave on this track and sin is the pimp son
Homer chokin', I just seen Bart Simpson
Danger man cause this thing is a monster
Pro said fight cause sin, it'll harm ya
So that's what I do 'til I hear the bell ring
Starting up a riot that's a everyday thing

[Hook]
La da da da, la di da di da (x4)
Start a riot (x8)
WHOA

[Verse 2]
Ok, battle lines drawn, face paint on
When the opposition come it's time to drop bombs
War clothes on you can call it Under Armour
God given weapons so the enemy won't harm ya
Yes, I'm a snitch or you can say informer
Call it what you wanna, ay I'm just tryna warn ya
Keep it on the low, watch ya name, become a tabloid
Sin can't afford it, but we still tryna pay for it
And you will 'til you riot
Fight with everything cause the law can beat you down, Rodney King
(and you just tryna get along, you don't see that nothin' wrong
But when you get alone you tryin' to get it on)
But wuth the Lord ain't no such thing as secret
He know what you finna say way before you speak it
Knows what you finna look at way before you see it
Knows everything so confess it man, seek Him

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye (x4)
La di da da, we come back and reload
La di da da, Don't hold back, here we go
La di da da, I know that be fo' sho
La di da da, Hold it down, let's go
Cause I refuse to be the one lynin' on the Son
Like He don't change lives, I'm alive
Look at what He's done
I'm a product of confession man
Every line's a lesson
I repent and tell it, no occupation, profession

[Hook]
