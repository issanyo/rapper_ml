[Intro]
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

[Chorus: Tedashii]
Yeah, yeah yeah
It's right there on the money that in God we trust
Momma said "forget that money cause if God wit us"
I could go beat the block
Like I don't need the block
I could go bleed the block
Or, I could lead the block

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Every winter, bring the heat 'cause it was cold
I didn't wanna do it, we was all alone
Every Christmas, Santa missed us, we was broke
Now I get this, gotta get this on my own
Every holiday was not a holiday
Every holiday nobody got a break
Momma workin' just to fight to find her faith
Every hurt I felt, it fell down on my face

[Interlude]
Until the son of God appear

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Yeah, every chance I get, I gotta work the reaper, I got
I gotta kill it for my people, I know!
Livin' like we all just hit the lotto!
And is it just like me, yeah
You made it through
God is with us, that's the truth
I'm the proof
He made me new, yeah
I be out watchin'
Window, I'm shoppin'
Wish I could cop it
Regardless, he got me
God is still with us, I promise, there's no other option

[Chorus: Tedashii]
It's right there on the money that in God we trust
Momma said "forget that money cause if God wit us"
I could go beat the block
Like I don't need the block
I could go bleed the block
Or, I could lead the block
It's right there on the money that in God we trust
Momma said "forget that money cause if God wit us"
I could go beat the block
Like I don't need the block
I could go bleed the block
Or, I could lead the block

[Outro]
O come, O come, Emmanuel...
