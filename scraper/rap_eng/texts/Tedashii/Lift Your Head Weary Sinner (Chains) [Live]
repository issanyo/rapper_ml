[Verse 1: Crowder]
Lift your head weary sinner, the river's just ahead
Down the path of forgiveness salvation's waiting there
You built a mighty fortress 10,000 burdens high
Love is here to lift you up, here to lift you high

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're lost and wandering
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory open wide

[Verse 2: Crowder]
All who've strayed and walked away, unspeakable things you've done
Fix your eyes on the mountain, let the past be dead and gone
Come all saints and sinners, you can't outrun God
Whatever you've done can't overcome the power of the blood

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're lost and wandering
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory open wide
If you're lost and wrecked again
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory be open wide

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
I ain't from here I'm H-town
But at this stage my place now
It's going down, no parachute
This so sick I need Theraflu
And there might be some they don't have a clue
These moments don't get no rarer dude
Cliqued up, 40 deep right there with you
Unashamed of the name, they can too
We turnt up, that's right
Mind blown no glass pipe
In my zone we pass tight
This right here could be my last night
I count that, I don't doubt that
Going in I shout that
You don't see it I'm about that
This world man, I'm out that
He paid it all, no green backs
With a bruised heel no sling back
The King's back
You've seen that
I mean that, redeem that
So we in here
Better get used to it
Who'll do it you do it
Otherwise you blew it
Flew through it
Trying to be fly
Gassed up, trying to touch the sky
We're blind though these blindfolds
We're rippin' off rickety bifocals
If you can't see, you can't be
Wasting my time by waiting
We're making it moved through
Reality, no escaping it
We're here to stay so let me hear you say
Here to stay so let me hear you say
Chain's off me I know that's fact
I love God I know that best
Christ saved me he ain't holding back
One more man, no holdin' back

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're lost and wandering
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory open wide
If you're lost and wrecked again
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory be open wide

[Outro: Crowder]
Let the gates of glory be open wide
Let the gates of glory be open wide
