Yeah ayo
Listen to the horns play
I get busy all day
I don't give a fuck what they wanna say
This is me turning it up
This is me burning it up
You, observing the emcee bus
Just a coach on the side lines
Tryna bide time
Watching the game being played out through my eyes
I know it's painful how they degrade you
But I praise you
This is the soundtrack that we will train to
This is not a call to arms
I did that ten years ago
These are called keep alert bars
Don't talk just work your jaws
Don't walk just work the war
That's a personal flaw
Murdered bar after bar since 1974
When I was born with a mic on my arm
Awesome
Six minutes Canibus you on
Yes, yes y'all
To the beat god, next bar
I do this to atone
I do this to atone for my sins
But I am punished for the tone of my skin
Bring it down about 14.5 DB
Maybe then you might see what I mean
Out in Berkley
They not too thirsty
They don't like veterans neither, but they can't hurt me
Bring it down about 14.5 DB
Maybe then you might see what I mean
Ayo, Hip-hop provost
Who said the word Hip-hop the most?
Which one of yous think you a poet?
Perfect cause you practice that classic
Scholastic, Canibus man shit
The current catalogue and past tense
I do this to atone
We all must atone for our sins
But I am punished for the tone of my skin
The C of tranquility - the C means light
The light means space, my DNA strain is my base
Don't know who I am
Can't remember who I was
I pump blood through the veins of Hip-hop
For street buzz
A constitution written in collusion
With limited distribution
Since I was recruited I've been making music
