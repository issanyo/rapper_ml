[Intro: woman]
Are you refreshed? It’s really nice when more of our human friends come to the party and see the light

[Hook: Canibus]
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what you gon' tell them?

[Verse: Canibus]
Bronze master percussionist, time flies, life dies
Phoenix rise, wiseman rhymes, I’m loving it
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Bed down location, Kodiak radio stations
Spruce cape scapegoat Space Ghost lasers
What’s your gift? What's your talent?
What does it matter if Alex is right and this is a prison planet?
5 man team detachment, XYZ axis
That’s what happens when you come to Alaska
The paracord packing, king crabber, big booty bitch grabbing
Snowmobiles in the snow zigzagging
My snowboard paraffin waxing like Tom Cruise acting
Yeah, Sarah Palin looking for Maverick
A square shaped planet, pyramid head shaped poet named Hamlet
Rip the Jacker octopus breakdancing
Quantum questions require quantum answers
Tell me why is this mantis woman tryna be romantic?
555 cloud storage cybernetics performed as expected
The human brain is now a barbarous relic
Phonology professor articulating phonetics
Participating for credit, if nothing else, just to send a message
Wake up and smell the petunias, I’m in Peru with my vicuñas
Why do I keep seeing Mila Kunis?
I was told, "After death life isn’t the same
And when the Phoenix rise, death would not be the endgame”
Technology devalues life, intruding ones rights
Contaminating the cost, excluding the price
Removing insight from the human plight
Your historians are doomed to rewrite, click the button if you like Under the pale moonlight, weapons of unknown types
Marduk, Tarnush, Kingu and Heru fight
Or maybe they're working together to keep us all working forever
In subterranean emergency shelters
Toong guung guung uumnuwabu, sataah paapu aht se ahktu
Classical patwah mi chat too
Enter four tones of four, intonations and contours
The Westmoreland song of the Moors
When an irresistible force faces an immovable thought
The crucible will be buried in the salt
Next to the boot marks and the minds and the hearts
And the cav spurs that march till it’s all lost
I never got to say goodbye, I never learned the truth
Cause every word produced was a lie
And now here I stand before the creator of man
A reptile woman with mantis hands
All worlds are strange
And yet? As above so below, it's all the same
Different only in name, descriptions deviate
According to the code displayed, how you know Germaine?
I was told by a whispering loud mouth that came down from the clouds
Her mouth never moved, telepathic style
The science was misinterpreted, they said, “It’s time that you know now
The when, the where, the why and the how”
This is what I been praying for, on day 84
I was walking with Lao-Tzu along the mainland wall
From the Zhangye to the Danube to the Nile to the Mississippi south
Every paradigm makes sense now
Except the ones they reject now but only when in front of a crowd
Behind closed doors they break your shit down
Beyond the frequencies of sound we so far passed that now
That reality becomes the background
As transparent as cellophane, doorways to parallel planes
My hemispheres create parallel brains
Where my focus strains to create change
Until Germaine’s DNA is downloaded through wireless veins
Then uploaded any direction I aim, all directions at once
I pass around omnidirectional blunts
Instead of one to the head, it’s like one to the zero
To the one, one -zero-one-zero instead
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, that’s the next lesson
Telepathic impressions replace questions
JIBO replaces engineers for studio sessions
J-I-B-O JIBO ni hao, ni hao yo
Free flow, RTJ JIBO
Thought I was done a week ago
But there’s so many different ways 10 thousand bars could unfold
You could never be too enlightened to never wanna know
What you could never understand, even though you probably won’t
