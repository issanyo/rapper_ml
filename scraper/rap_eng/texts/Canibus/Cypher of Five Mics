[Intro]
"None of y'all got the balls big enough to battle"
"Fuckin' with Canibus, you get ate up"
"You can't even absorb the rhymes I record"
"Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker, above average"
"Hit you so hard my hand breaks & your shoulder dislocates"
"I snatch your crown with your head still attached to it"
"The Canibus is ill like that"

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Yo, I murder a sixteen to the point that it's embarrassing
Hide a grenade in my jeans, douse the booth in kerosene
Shatter your heart's main vein pipe
Insane at night, I might have your career disappear in plain sight
Throw you off the top of a church, stab you with a steeple
I'm bloodying punchlines like I assaulted a hundred zebras
Non-believers and their Lyric Jesus is haters that savor
They're afraid since my native halo in the cradle
Became a famous behemoth, misbehaving angel
Insane but able with razors scraping your face through ya neighbor's naval
A fatal fable from Satan's table with an unstable brain cable
I'm hateful, blame it on being biracial
I'm psychologically an anomaly
Should be given formal apologies, honestly a human oddity
A commodity, godly when rapist spitting, his blood spilling
Chino so stuck up, gotta peel me off the fucking ceiling
I'm bringing so much beef it'll make a Hindu kneel
Too hard to kill you, heart's unequal, beat you 'til you partial gristle tissue
Too fast for a photo, I slash the rapper who'd be homo
Leave him just skull and crutches like Jackass's movie logo
Burn down your fucking apartment, barricade the fire escape
What I spit is rape, Chino make nightmares try to stay awake
You've never had a fly quote, nigga you and I know
The best thing you'll ever write is a suicide note
Get the fuck outta here!

[Hook]
"You can't even absorb the rhymes I record"
"I kick that shit real niggas feel"
"The Canibus separates your body from your spirit"
"Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker above average"
"Canibus"
"What I'm spitting in your ear was intended to stimulate your left brain's hemisphere"
Five mics, yeah
Five mics, yeah
Five mics, yeah

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Canibus and Chino XL, rebels from Hell
He's a giant, I'm a stinger missile toting Keebler Elf
Keep to myself, strategic but stealth
If I don't need it, I leave it, believe it, I kept it greasy for more than sixty seasons
Tear the target to pieces, reload and repeat it
I got a billion bars but I ain't got the time to release it
And you ain't got the time to listen to it, hitman music
Blow a hole through your head and piss through it 'cause you ain't fit to do this
He vocaled it first, I vocaled it second
Lyrics get murdered, we move in and do the forensics
Shut down your studio sessions, DNA analysis and collections
Cause mic checking is a Ripper's jurisdiction
I'm a telepathic detective
Blast you with a non-kinetic weapon back to the essence, beyond the Outer Limits
Wicked and wretched, send you a message, lure your ass out to the desert
Motherfuckers, prepare for the unexpected
We meet, symbolic technique, anabolic release
Any MC gets weak when he knows he's dead meat
If I strike, you'll be red for weeks
You mic checkin' with a beast that'll tan you like the Mexican heat
The steps to my monastery are steep
If you still feeling froggy when we get to the top, then lets leap
Inhale the hydrogen mist, then try to get hyper than Bis
It can't get no hyper than this
Lyrical Law hands on, jet turbo fans on
Aviators are drawn into a criss-cross sand launch
Turn starboard but still can't dodge
Bank hard, S.O.S call command coms, concentrate, can't talk
Not out of the woods yet, you can't thank God
The Red Baron's hair is as long as Susan Sarandon
War Hawks and red hawks launch, out the underground air force
You bail out like Amelia Earhart
SEER training is for naught, I caught you before I finished my cigar
You a prisoner of Lyrical Law
Yeah, now I'ma seal the whole area off
What the fuck you thought? Ain't nobody scaring me off, aight
Niggas be rhyming like they lazy and soft
Get ate by the SpitBoss, this is Lyrical Law, yeah
Niggas be rhyming like they lazy and soft
Then get ate by a SpitBoss, this is Lyrical Law
Fuck you!

[Outro]
"None of y'all got the balls big enough to battle"
"Fuckin' with Canibus, you get ate up"
"You can't even absorb the rhymes I record"
"Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker, above average"

"I snatch your crown with your head still attached to it"
"The Canibus is ill like that"
"You can't even absorb the rhymes I record"
"I kick that shit real nigga's feel"
"The Canibus' separates your body from your spirit"
"Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker, above average"
"Canibus"
"What I'm spitting in your ear was intended to stimulate your left brains hemisphere"
