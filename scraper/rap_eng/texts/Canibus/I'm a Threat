[Hook, Dylan Dilinjah]

Now all you respect me because I'm a threat
You sleeping and you slept 'til you see infrared
Now when the gun starts you hope for my set
You should be worried because I'm coming for your neck

[Verse 1:  Canibus]

Yo, big black and burly my buzz cut curly
Spend a weekend at Bernies with me and a 30-30
Shot group not tight, I readjusted the sight
On the Dillinger, spin cylinders and bust the pipe
Garrison personnel up in the Hamburger Hill Hotel
I roll an L and call Dylan's cell (Ayo Wha'gwan, who dis?)
I'm in the backyard shooting beer bottles off bricks
Now the shot group tight, I readjusted the sight
On the Dillinger, spin cylinders and bust the pipe
[Dylan Dilinjah:
Well I'm drinkin' some rum mix it up with chum
Load it up the big gun for big fish come]
Pirates from the Caribbean, jankrow citizenship
Mercenaries on some militant shit
We ride modified Sea-Doos, two man crews
Of three dudes, shout to number one fire team too

[Hook: Dylan]

[Verse 2: Born Sun]

Born Sun, I'm strapped with a homicide rap
My clap murder the track, do my bid and come back
Shark tooth thumb tacks, bullet proof tires with run flat
With a bellowed shell and gun claps
Run through Hell with hunchbacks
In an 18 wheeler, pictures of Jesus Christ on the mud flaps
Two-twos with tattoos, supernatural black jewels
Gezundheit, gats get at you
In ripped jeans and chains I'm a slave to the rhythm
Obama is the prez but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
That's my word, rappers slip on my slick words
I eat bars, shoot metaphors and spit verbs
Heavyweight hardware bruises and wrist furs
I get pissed off, lick off and spit yearn
South African in the Vatican getting arrogant
Soundclash again, make a ghost of David Rodigan

[Hook]
