Voice 1:  I'm aware of the conspiracies
Voice 2: We the wrong crew to cross
Voice 3:  Constantly look over your shoulders

[Verse 1:  Planet Asia]
Espionage squad
Men at large stolen cares crooked cops stole boys
Cookin' rocks beastin' it hard
Bloods and Crips
Military niggas home from the war
It's hard to find peace for the gods
Hammer told his pot mama in the living room taking shots
We at the laundry-mat breaking the locks
We got fiends begging for clubs
My team running the slums
Rocket night flights for bubble gum bottoms
You might just get hit up lit up
Quick got niggas doing pushups pullups dips
My mind is an infinite clip
Falser decliner
From Hollywood to China my attention's never minor
Some dudes act like they got vaginas
This is project apartments
Turf shit, grimey, find me with a ratchet
Ratatat lick off your lashes, splash
Right through the Easter egg basket you bastard
Never would you be known, disreputable chain
We turnin' niggas into world star spectacles
Sign away cyberspace, strategy strychnine
We pinpoint and penetrate
Bogart big time

[HOOK]

[Verse 2:  Nino Graye]
Where I reside no reason to be bought at all
Broken bottles on asphalt
Graffiti on back porch
Barely 18, ready to let the brat off
Strangers to their parents
First name basis with the task force
There's only a few ways out if you stay here
And there's more graveyards and playgrounds and daycare
I rep Midwest's most wanted
Don't flaunt it, cold-hearted
Try and bridge a gap, get thrown off it
Nino to rap rebel whack level
Cats should act mellow, backpedal
Cause that fellow's back, HELLO
L.A. incredible
Can't help but to let em know
Forever in a zone like the letters N-N-O
Next to blow, nickname's Mr. Pyrex and Stove
Yes I'm dope, smell that raw stench up in my clothes
Stupid with it who is stylin' with us
Make your top five kids rockin' helmets ridin' a bus
Easy

[HOOK]

[Verse 3:  Canibus]
Covert commando, juggle O'Jangles
Street theater, purchasin' tickets for Fandango
The candle lights flicker
Spirits talk to me with a whisper
Brothers and sisters {​​​​​​Sample: ​Brothers and sisters}​​​​​​​
Androids dream of electric sheep
While all phone communications intercepted by the Beast
Continuity of your foolery and fakeass jewelry
Economy crash whatcha gonna do to eat?
The end is beginnin'
It's already begun is my feelin'
That's why I'm chillin', freeze dried food drillin'
And literary scholars always trying to borrow a dollar
"Do I not have other qualities father?"
No you're going straight to hell my son
For the same reason your feet smells and your nose runs
Useless eaters and breeders
Weak creatures worshipping Jesus
Each of combat systems are needed
You've been dumped and deleted
You've been left there bleeding just like Caesar
Carnivores feeding off your ether
Now a Sixth Street nonbeliever
I don't wanna talk to your leader
Because he's a triskaidekaphobic policeman
The power to govern answers to the queen of the coven
A big Thundergods' pretty-ass woman
Nicely educated weather girl who loves feathers and pearls
Trying to live in this pessimist's world
I'm a alpha New York bouncer
A West Coast pet of Green Falcon
I represent the Almighty album
