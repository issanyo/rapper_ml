[Intro: Canibus]
Yeah...
This is what I call an intro mixed with a sick flow
This is for Fatol, here it go, yo

[Verse 1: Canibus]
My after mid-night flow is a fright show
Where emcees try to battle to see if they might blow
Uncovered the hidden scrolls, From the days of old
When all lyricist were bold an spoke from the soul
Modality outside the womb was changed
When I was exhumed, it will change once again soon
I let go- My pen writes free of any grip
Spit lyrics- My soul feels free of any sin
Emcee's recycled for redistribution
Only the illest will still release new music
Canibus, Fatol, angels of death that chase you
Catch you before you can catch breath
Split personality, spit pulsive at best
Impulsive on the set, I am the Lord of Finesse
The Garrison park leads to my gallery of art
Following flattery of sloth before we battle in the dark
Whatever your fate, Frequency 528
Is the repair frequency for the damaged DNA
Holy water make me spit harder, cluster water make me rip harder
Structure water help me outspit the Father
Author, Poor Pauper on it, put you through the Hip-Hop gauntlet
You will never recover from the torment
Spin Black August an white carcass
Photographers snap shots of bright orbs and objects in Earths orbit
You poor son of a bitch, You rhyme like the son of Canibus
This is my underground analysist, the Impact causes rapper paralysis
Let me ask you this, on the average, how many bars you spit?
I'll tell you this, I spit enough bars
To afford a small log cabin overlooking Rippers Rivers Fall
I still spit for the Gods, an give it my all
No matter whoes here, no matter whoes gone it lives on
We build to become strong, I stand on the top of the Trilithon
An encourage you spit a million bars
Up to the task, Send details fast
Through E-Mail blasts, While I telepathically telecast
To each and every Emcee who ever spit a rap
Brace yourself for the impact
Captain Cold Crush get busy on the track
Brace yourself for the impact

[Hook:]
So In The Ring you cannot win...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
The top 10 become 9 dead, If I ever decide to hop in...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
So In The Ring you cannot win...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
It's the impact, impact- impact...
The top 10 become 9 dead, If I ever decide to hop in...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
It's the impact... impact

[Verse 2: Fatol]
Only true warriors spit with me...
Use meta-phoric Euphoria an-
Omininous synphonies towards glorious victory...
Wage war on the industry, Drag the corpse of the enemy...
From the- Birth place of rap, To the shores of the Italy's...
With Enormous ability, Foes sopposed to be feelin' me-
They, Hate that they love it- Under oath they revealed to me...
Curse the throne of this tyranny, On my toes while I'm still asleep...
With- One eye opened, I was told they would visit me...
I- pierce the eyelids, With scenes of violence...
Peak the violins... An give ya ears Otitis...
A Sleepin' Giant... Comin' out of retirement...
Like Goliath taken vitamins with the stick of Posieden- KID...
An I'm wit Canibus A battlin advocate...
In the- Zone of the underground where rappers get buried in...
A beast with the message, Put the weak under pressure...
'Cause they couldn't amount to shit if they were being disgested...
Hah... Fatol the hex... The name you detest...
The Angel of death... Put these pagans to rest...
Thugs, Claimin the set- When they aim for respect...
While you gangstahs poppin' collars, I'll be aiming for necks...
On the pulpit of rap... Making a Declaration of War...
On all the bullshits that's wak...
Cold Crush Got my back...
An we about to attack, Unless they meet our demands-
I breathe for a second- Grit my teeth I'm weavin my weapon...
I'm feelin' the pressure... Bullets fly in seepin directions...
I sink to a shelter, My eye's don't even blink gettin' redder...
I think this a setup- I'm screaming for my team to dismember...
They hearin the call- They all- Never fearin the brawl...
Till tyranny falls, These bombs send 'em clear to allah...
The cheering response, Was 'Nah soldires killing them all'..
I'm feelin' the calm, Dear God, yo we need you involved...
Behold the Midas, Whoes touch of gold is cold as ice is...
Foes can find us, On our thrones of skulls an diamonds...
Speak from the heart, When releasing these bars...
Grip ya DNA an rip ya double helix apart...
On December 2012 with the world lookin' skyward...
Brace yourself the Impact...
As I watch the Meteorite coming towards the Horizon...
I brace myself for The Impact...

So In The Ring you cannot win...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
The top 10 become 9 dead, If I ever decide to hop in...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
-
So In The Ring you cannot win...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
It's the impact, impact- impact...
The top 10 become 9 dead, If I ever decide to hop in...
-Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't- Don't fuck around wit
It's the impact... impact
