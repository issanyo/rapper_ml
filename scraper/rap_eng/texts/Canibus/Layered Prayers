[Canibus]
Yea, ayo Mother Earth absorbs the blood I bleed
Hip-Hop is my blood - I believe
That I am not free, and neither are you
The only time I feel free is when I'm rhyming in the booth
The Lion on the loose is not a reckless recluse
But really a dictator with his neck in a noose
For war crimes; Hardcore rhymes from a warped mind
That enjoyed the dark matter in the void before time
The innocent murmured, murdered because they worshipped him
They let the serpent in but it never occurred to them
The deity regards emcees like me
Piously, check the degree, see if it's me
On planet Earth I design mankind's rebirth
A marvel of water and rock salt from a verse
The Moon, the Sun and the Stars
I am who you are, together, we all form God
I laugh at the creation of it, the explanation of it
Not the original but man's imitation of it
They took Hip-Hop and changed the subject
Then I brought Hip-Hop back and made you love it
Through deterrence, detention and prevention
Never write the wrong sentence
If I ever said it I meant it
The insatiable, inescapable regiment
What's the weight? Add four more plates, I bench it
Skinny-ass nigga, grab your neck with a pen-grip
Bend it through telepathic suggestion
I rap so serious, the vocal myriad
Occurred intermittently over protracted periods
Rap 'til you get delirious, wack niggas get furious
Keep dissin' me, your girl's gettin' curious
Darth Vader on the cross-fader releasin' the raw data
This is called hard jaw-breaker labour
When I see you I'mma battle you, then tackle you
Then grapple you, then probably snap you in two
Yo, ain't that the truth?, outside the booth
Air combat maneuvers without no computer
Space wings that cause pings MOTHAFUCKA!!!
We gon' dogfight above cloud cover
High in the friendly skies, where unfriendlies lie
Where friendlies and unfriendlies die
You and I race to the Sun, I just got back
The race is done, ages have ended and ages have begun
Cognizance saturation, I am the one
Tell me where chain-gun Germaine came from?
Dara-I-Suf, the river of caves
My ribcage look like miniature shim blades
When I bathe in the waters below
Still waters run deep, King Cthulhu told me so
Magna-dome under Yellowstone inside the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse
Cause man cannot establish dominance over man
Indefinitely; man only respects God's energy
Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse
Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse
