[Canibus]
The odds are the dark star's not very far off
Toxicology report said he had an elephant heart
I'm like a Gollum with greasy hair
And a creepy stare born on a leap year
Meet me there, let me see if you care
Crawl from the ocean onto the land
Complete the plan, deeply tanned
Face, feet and hand covered with beach sand
Feed off freshwater seaweed
Mini stools looked like bb's
Stood on a throne of wreathed sea leaves
Neti pot, clean flush, nasal confetti snot
Just because I let her sit on my face, maybe not
Exercise alone eating cold stone ice cream cones
Measuring Yellowstone with temperature probes
Grass dont grow, wack-o-mole, facial expression wax bold
Gamma radiation from black holes attack souls
Drone pilots report they was attacked by giants
I say every survivalist is Darwinism Compliant
Bruce Lee, brother Noon Sea on a Chinese junk
We could use the island over there where these beats came from
I'm a dark radiant super-sapian grafted onto an alien
Who cloned himself to listen to Germaine again
Canibus Atticus Finch suspense thriller about to go to print
In bold ink, you cold-blooded old bitch
Canibus, Thanos, my nigga Thirst the Howl that came over to armwrestle on a three-legged table
Make America Mexican!
My A-team like Gregory Peck and em
Mr. T bodyguard the President
Murdoch is Marduk, top gun like Tom Cruise
Making a bomb run on Kim-Jong Un!
This is real life, fool it ain't no cartoon
Get a clue, hot barbeques and ice cold brews
Nothing new under the sun, but what if we got two?
Full Spectrum Dominance bro, coming soon

[Thirstin Howl III]
The odds are they fear the perfect(?) energy
Move with the energy, they in the lead
But I stay grounded like a centipede
The teeth 2000, the housing, scanning all the hieroglyphs
Stuck in microchips, gas clocks kept him alive to flip
More flow than Poseidon, I do not ?
Higher than a world of tyrants where they want your Gods silent
It's Beelzebub! Witness hell or bust, soon as he felt the scud
Destroying humanity like the time that God held the flood
The country's fucked! Trump is creating an Elmer Fudd
Bela Lugosi celebrating over the smell of blood
Wise like the cyborg with global red eyeballs
Fighting with my human side shining when the light's off
War biochemical, airborne I will end you
Suffocate till you're dead, tryna breathe through an inner tube
And everybody call it conspiracy gossping
But you will see when you start paying for oxygen
