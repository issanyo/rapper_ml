(Intro: Canibus, speaking during chorus)
Yeah
Tyrique ain't here to tell his story
So I'mma tell it for himâ€¦

(Chorus, Queen sample)(2x)
Hey little babe your changing
Babe are you feeling sore
Ain't no use in pretending
Don't wanna play no more

(Verse One)
Yo, Tyrique got an older brother running the streets
300 large a week he moving so Tyrique hardly speak to him
Tyrique got a younger brother Jamal
Who got a full scholarship at St. John's to ball
His mom named Myrtive, I think that's how it sound when I heard it
She was on her way to church late for worship
She praying that he quit hustling
She say one day Ezekiel 23 verse 2 gonna mean somthing
He said, "Aight ma" but it don't mean nothing
She know his older brother got him into weed smuggling
She out of touch with him, wonder why he touch illegal substances
Can't believe he messing with that stuff again
I guess it just depends, he putting up the rent
Been doing it ever since, she ain't complain back then
Way back when, he following his heart not the Lord
'Cause Tyrique changed and he ain't pretending no more

(Chorus)(2x)

Yo, Tyrique ain't playing, he feeling good, he feeling great
He got three safes with nothing but scrilla and mixtapes
He push weight from state to state
Spit great, eat food on big plates, tip Benjamin big face
His shipment's never late to make the deadline dates
No fed time, the bottom line is no mistakes
Tyrique phone stay ringing
He got twenty unconfirmed but known women that he all hitting
Major release 'bout to drop, he number one on the charts
Street teams on every block, so many features and spots
People say he 'bout to supersede Pac
Now I know Tyrique hot, but if you ask me, we always gonna need Pac
He just anxious for his record to drop
The music industry watched as it shot to the top
He got the hottest video on The Box
Major change, moms and pop show Tyrique love non-stop

Chorus:x2

Two o' clock in the morning the horn ring
Usually he never answer it, but it was his brother calling
He picked up the phone and started talkinh
But it wasn't Jamal, it was Detective Hall trying to stalk him
He said, "I'm on the corner, Fifth and Carson
Sitting on the car garnet, your brother's in the back unconscious"
Tyrique said, "Who, Jamal?" Detective said, "Nah try again
I'm talking bout your older brother Iverson
If you ain't here in ten minutes I'ma ride him in
And if you get here, I'm still taking both you guys in"
Tyrique ain't know how to react
Detective Hall said, "I got you now my friend" and hung up the jack
Tyrique stuffed twenty g's in a sack, tucked the gat
Drove to Third and Carson, parked and called him back
Detective Hall said, "Where you at?
Yo time is paper, you waste mine I'ma make you give it back"
Tyrique saying to himself, "Man, fuck the bullshit
You got a dirty badge bitch, I'ma give you a full clip"
But out loud he saying, "Alright man, what you wanna do
I'm less than two blocks from you"
Tyrique start to feel it was a set-up
Detective Hall just wouldn't let up, he pressing his luck
Approaching the car with his hand on his firearm
Tyrique calm but he wish he had a fucking firebomb
Just like something he wrote in a song before
Sweat in his palm, the feelings in his legs was gone
His chest was numb, his shirt was red, where he bled
They found Tyrique and Jamal both dead
One through the heart, second week on the chart, the album peaked
Now he platinum in the streets, Tyrique rest in peace
Tyrique or Jamal could be me
And Tyrique or Jamal could be any up-and-coming emcee

(Chorus)(2x)

(Outro: Canibus, during chorus)
Freaky Tah, Jam Master J, Soldier Slim, B.I.G.,
Big L, 2Pac, y'all rest in peace...
Just like Tyrique
