I'm about eight thousand miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an ad in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert in Jersey last Thursday
A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
His rhyme was very weak; I didn't know he had words for me
I bet he's probably never even heard of me
Ever since I met Stan, he took it kinda personally
It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally
With Stan earlier than me, now he's perturbed at me
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me
And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me
Damn, I didn't know he was that thirsty for me
I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me
There ain't a person in the game wit more courage than me
From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef
What you want yo? Red or white meat?
Meet me in Petty I'm with JRU and sightseeing
Man I got a nice feeling
I'm working on my fourth album and when I think about it I've had a tight career
Haven't I made it quite clear
Lyrically I'll always be right here and nobody can snatch my mic here
Rip the Jacker was a nightmare
Jack the Ripper reminds me of him and I don't really like that
What type of a life is that
It's like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap
Damn, I can write raps, I'm good at it ain't I?
Niggas call my name out, cuz they want the mic back
But I raise the price so high that in fact
The market is collapsed and niggas don't know how to act
I guess the world's chaos is spinning over the raps
They make you sign a contract, and con you out of your tracks
Don't act like you don't know Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit
I left you frozen stiff
With malted Aluminum and molded tip
I'll pierce a hole through a brick, you know I can Rip
Gimme five, I'll show you six quicker than you can blink
Probably quicker than you can think
As quick as ink drives my rhymes are contagious like pink eye
The hypnotize you to dickride
I'm 'Illmatic' like Nas and 'Stillmatic' like Escobar
No I'm not still at it with Todd
Don't blame me, it wasn't my fault it never was
Before I even knew him I already had a buzz
But that was then and this is now
Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out
I've been there, done that, I don't even have to make a comeback
I move over to France where the love's at
Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks
Create a cure for AIDS with a device that connects to the nutsack
Capable of altering a man's blood pattern
Humanitarianism will love that
I start a label with other acts, get a couple plaques
Completely cover the map before I come back
I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss
Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis
I'm an extremist, when I'm on some MC shit
And after this you could never not believe in Bis
Terry stone, UK clique, keeping it thick
Use my name motherfuckers when you speaking to Bis
