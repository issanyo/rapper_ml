[Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
One time
We bless the track
Rush to the back
It's the LB fam Dogg Pound we attack
One time for the LP, LB
My family come through
This how we do
Group Home, Universal bounce one

[Mr. Cheeks]
Power moves to be made, Rap game in trade
Clown niggas getting paid, it's getting sharp as a blade
The mind stays used I stay confused I'm steady thinking
One dutch burning, I'm already drinking
Here to lay the real, I know the deal, I feel the envy
But those that try to blind me, right behind me where my men be
Dutches be burning soon as I let it scrap
But skeet from Tennessee, give my main man dap
Caught up in the game black can't explain that
But longevity that's what I aim at
You wanna come through and try to test your fucking skill
Kid I go the shit that pay the rent plus the bills
Send your clown niggas back to the fucking hills
Me and my fam giving competition chills
For real, from the East to the West
LBs all about cheese, who's the best?
Break your wins down like a pronoun
On the road with me and my click Tha Dogg Pound
Throw your hands up you wanna fucking toss
I'm that guy - Land of the Lost
Listen up, I'm a special ordinary guy
Love bitches and money and I love being high
One with the Dogg Pound, my brother Freaky Tah
Music Makes Me High

[Canibus]
Yo the combination of Mr. Cheeks, Canibus and Kurupt
Is enough to make the reels on cassette tapes bust
Cause none of you fools is capable
My lyrical will knock you on the floor like a mechanical bull
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Who wants to be the one to get struck first
I bury they body on any other planet except the Earth
I rip up, swell your lip up, it's a stick up
Make you put your hands on your head like you was doing sit-ups
Lost Boyz and DPG causing trouble
We out of control like an involuntary muscle
Can't nobody else smoke more than my team
20 pounds of weed and a gallon of Visine
Ya na' mean, I fly the friendly skies
Whenever Music Makes Me High

Chorus:

Music makes me high
These tracks keep makin' me high
These beats keep makin' me high (Freaky Tah)
The music makes me high  (Dogg Pound Dogg Pound)
Music makes me high
And these tracks keep makin' me high and
And these beats keep makin' me high
'Cause the music makes me high

[Kurupt]
Territorial game, what's ya know? Where ya at?
I'm coming through wit a mack, I'm out to get my paper back
You can't harm me even if ya lived eternal
Get incinerated from this verbal inferno
From what's created get physically castrated
I'm so glad i made in a world where I'm hated
Big time gameah got the game orchestrated
Correct me mashin' in Jags and Bentleys
Imitated cause youse an imitater punk
Jump wit Kurupt and get slumped cause i dumps
With no questions or no hesitation I'm bussin'
End of discussion as my adrenaline's rushin'
Irrational, the Mr. Castro of the capital
It's actual factual fact I use tactical skills
To get me in the position to kill
Get popped like pills tryin' 'a jump as they wills

Chorus

[Daz Dillinger]
Can I rock? Uh, can I rock my rhymes?
The deadliest rhymes, as lethal as land mines
Time after time I beat the hell out of a track
Most definitely I gets busy when we attack
Notes, analogs, dialogues and formats
Be on some ill type streets raps from way back
As a child I got wild with styles
I need to shine all day and I rock the crowd
I destroy and completely vaporizing my opponents
Be on it like a hornet kick you dead in your stomach
Doggone it tell my why they want it so bad
Daz Dillinger killin' and peelin' caps back
So get down, tell me I'll come around
So get down Lost Boyz and Dogg Pound
I bet ya get to seein' now tell whatcha gonna do
A tough guy can be a dead guy when fuckin' wit my crew
So fasten your seat belt and see how hard it's felt
Therefore we stay hardcore what else? What else?

Chorus to fade
