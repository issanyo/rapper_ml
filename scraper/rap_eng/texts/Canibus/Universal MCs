[Canibus]
Now [?] or the Jersey path
Go to 53rd Street between Sixth and Seventh Ave
13:25, meet me on the 5th floor
And we can go to war, with the metaphors
I kick the ill rap, recoup a Gil strap
Step in the conference room and get your wig peeled back
In a lyrical grudge match
Where I be smashing, and bashing MCs [?] referees
I go by the name of the Canibus
Handsome like Malik Yoba without the ashy lips
