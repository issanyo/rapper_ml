[Verse 1: Canibus]
How long can they keep America distracted?
When will the world dump the dollar in the trash bin?
It was good while it lasted, but now we’ve been lambasted
What do you think life will be like for your grandkids?
A local watchman climbed up the wall
A United Nations sniper plucked him off
He said, “If I should die before I wake
Cremate my remains and send ’em to deep space”
Creative overdrive, completely overloaded with rhymes
This is what we were supposed to design
Prometheus Proteus Prime, frontal lobes plus both sides
Golden spindles spiral over the spine
He spent the lion’s share of his life promoting skills
A wise man once said, “The son don’t chill”
Ask your boss why the HEPA filter got switched off
The press release said it has something to do with the cost
From riches to rags every scumbag is mad
You mad ‘cause we all got empty lunch bags
The deck is clean; the cables are green
The wind speed is 30 knots over the sea
Satellite targeting, air superiority
My Law: space bags, ammo and armory
Take to the sky like a falcon, look at you grounded
The mind’s eye could move a mountain
The ground beneath your feet is skidding sideways
Domingo said, “We got 365 days”
Family, country, God, respect
Give me liberty or give me death!
