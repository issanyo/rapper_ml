[Canibus]
The triple six devil with a double had a metal muzzle
Containment chamber was connected to a metal tunnel
Magnetically charged, tractor beam energy bars
The whole planet is a memory card
The GPS don't track, maps are abstract
Vehicles are autonomously Autobahn fast-tracked
Conditions harsh enough to make your heart stop at least once
Eventually you get used to it son
Niggas drink hard liquor and fight
Gimme some water I'll be sober all night
I might have walked, I might have rode my bike
You might bark, I might bite
Get so excited I go into a seizure and collapse on sight
My loved ones will mourn me, others will continue to scorn me
The world will mourn what I wanted to be
They'll regret not achieving what I wanted them to see
An absolutely pure Hip Hop odyssey
The dark blue water, where great whites solicit and loiter
Then take a bite outta your boiler
But there's no need for greed, smile and say cheese
Behave, do good deeds and god will be pleased
Analyze the loops I wanna use, load 'em into Pro Tools
Go in the booth, the microphone fuse
Online with the Q2012 Juice Crew
'Bout to mix infinite bars for you
He's one of the few MCs alive thats qualified
With field experience to speak on the quality of rhymes
Design and do away with the assembly line
Even DARPA can't deny him when he's spittin' and rhymin'
XG3 bold faced beat network team
Way above cloud screen, they scream but can't breath
If they kill you, they gon' have to answer to me
Kofi Annan says weapons down, cease fire please
The Cheshire Cat stop showing teeth whenever I rap
"Damn man, why they beefin' like that?"
The year's 2050:
Alternative energy source sustainability will shape the next century
Fossil fuel drilling is outlawed, it causes a frenzy
The use of petroleum carries a penalty
They mock it till they see it turn a profit then they forced to adopt it
All of a sudden they experts about it, operation covert infinity
We must stave off any opposing subversive activity
Hip Hop tough jaw, running roughshod
Through the dark with some tough ass Iditarod dogs
Coattails following a frozen cold trail
Because the photographer bailed there's no details
Real-time awareness, without clarity people get careless
Nobody was prepared for this
After the advent of wireless charging
All sockets no longer wanted, everything was plugged in before this
Back to them again: Tesla, Maxwell and Edison
I know what it feels like to be one of them
I'm from the days when a thoroughbred horse
Could outrun a Model T Ford on a soft-top racecourse
The future is now, Rip The Robot computer style
His voice is no longer unusually loud
Rip The Reptilian, Zimmerman, Rip the Zeta Reticulan
Branch Davidian, Insectoid citizen
The low-hanging branch with the fruit gets picked first
A young boy walking on the street gets strip searched
Why do divine beings treat slaves so bad?
Why do divine beings even have slaves man?
It's hard for any life-form not to take it personal
Knowing that you be destroyed after servitude
We love one-another we ain't just pretending
We love Hip Hop that's why we keep mixing
We love one-another we ain't just pretending
We love Hip Hop that's why we keep mixing
Now it's your turn to make a decision
