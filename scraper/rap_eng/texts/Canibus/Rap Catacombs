[Intro: Canibus]
Hip Hop is not dead
It's just going through a little recession like Canibus said
He plans to fix it all with no less than 10,000 Bars
If he is wrong he will write more

[Verse 1: Pro the Leader]
From the cradle to the grave, sacrifices have been made
Can't accept the fact that I'm going back to my old ways
Choices have been made, hoist the mic from the cave
Catacombs of Hip Hop, throwing grenades
It was a teamer, don't make me tell you twice
Like a child's room that needs to be cleaned up
On a going like a fiend fiended up, amplified sound waves
That'll shatter barricade, your dreams crushed
___ or you're free from the cut
Like your favourite super villains in comic books _____
From the sea to the lairs and the pyramids in Egypt
Legions legit, nothing you say is legitimate
Not even just a little bit
Leave you riddle with verses, you are __ for a purpose
Cautious of cause it's back to the laboratory
More stories bone chilling episodes mystical
Off into the mist he goes, show him how to rip a flow
My position is pivotal, listen to the lyrical academy
You can't take the humanity out of me
Study my anatomy, you couldn't find someone to challenge me
It certainly, ____ someone better to challenge me
Shout it adamantly, ___ they mad at me
Check it, the floor beneath you is collapsing, lapsing

[Verse 2: Holocaust]
I have returned from the dark side, battle wound
The position of the stone point embedded in his right hip
Sons of the skeleton man was hit
From assailant from the front throwing his spear from many yards away lit
The bone grew back later they say
So the attack was not fatal we know today
Creaky joints were tomato, the vultures stay
Early arthritis in both knees was probably the result of a lifetime of squatting and kneeling
___ could score some resemblance of feeling, prehistoric way
The lowest point of America's in Death Valley
282 feet and 36 metres below sea level
You live in  the house of the Devil, the shovel
The territory might have been embezzled
I go blind until I stop searching, continue to destroy
May God help you all, land ahoy

[Verse 3: ]
Poet from a battleship, written like a hieroglyph.....

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]

So me make hits like batter up
I max out like state property
Black teeth
Practice being awake
Til the tree bunr me

[Verse 5: Canibus]
I be the first one to spit since I started it off
I drank a six pack of Bud Light and farted it off
The world is my fruit, I squeeze it for juice
And as soon as the beat loop I lock, load and shoot
Enemies of your enemy are your friends
But you will pay a stiff penalty for being friends with your enemy again
Ultimogeniture, as Hip-Hop's only known senator
Spit a better verse publishing editor
Success of dead creditor, et cetera, et cetera
Kneel before the emperor but kill him if he ever front
Beyond the Universe and back, you'll collapse
When I'm done with that, years after I'm done with rap
Subjugated to the mind and the energy that creates it
A space body in time is naked
Do not mess up when you verse your rhyme
Or you will be circumcised, your foreskin will look worse than mine
Mess up when you verse your rhymes and you will be circumcised
And given a slice of dingleberry pie
Mess up when you verse your rhymes and you will be circumcised
Your mind will be buried alive

[Outro: Canibus]
So get on your job and spit more rhymes motherfucker
