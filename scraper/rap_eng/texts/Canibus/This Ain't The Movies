I got human growth hormone bones
You better leave me alone
Badass M.A.N.P.A.D.S and drones
I follow slow, their footprints in the snow
They pigeon toed, they cooking with peanut oil
They gotta be close
I track the geese, take flight move east
Team real, tree fleece
They match rims on the pickup chief
I'm that p3 orion, dragon Judah standing next to the lion
With angels beside him and god behind em
The son of perdition wants to kidnap all of the women
And make slaves outta all of the children
Shinola hit the fan, the pine sol soils ya pants
You were warned - but you still in a trance
Brand new Lambroghini vans parked outside the Fema camps
Can't nobody change they plans?
You sat down in the chair and you crossed your legs
The next time you do that you'll be wearing depends
They took your picture up close - with a telescopic lens
They wrote a report that said you got terrorist friends
They all lies and more god damn lies
She got bedroom eyes, carmelized apples beef patty thighs
It ain't the brown mans fault - that the second Civil War jumped off
Who's his boss? Implicate the source
They got battle cruisers bigger than Cuba
With internet 2 computers, the front man is just one of they stooges
They control the information, they abuse it
Noone could disprove it, resistance means your already recruited, stupid
Identify threat within and external
EMP blast stop the war wagon when it circle
The keys the nuclear closet is in his upper jacker pocket
Locked him up with a Nuwabian prophet
The N D double A was the process
But they been doing this brown people since posse commiatus
Poverty migration, depopulation violations, genocide of nation
Through the god they put faith in
Our thoughts and spiritual energy force is wasted
Rebirth is eliminated, we are rehypothocated
World domination predidacted by human lab rats
And dead cats that got ate by economic Mad Max
Platinum before I knew what platinum was
Got plaques, tried to exchange it for cash and got laughed at
Not funny, still don't nothing move but the money
If the dollar is devalued - you just another dummy
Derivative bubbles, quasi illegitimate puzzles
They chuckle in they bungalow till it crumble
If you were me, then I would be humble
Seek out those who love you
Seek the lord for you know he loves you
Avoid digital voo doo and these black swan gurus
Yeah, it's the end of the world and business as usual
Americans ain't stupid, they're just distracted
The good life was good for as long as it lasted
Primary audio circuit, fait accompli emergency service
Pay me up front for the verses
Any currency is good as long as it can be converted
As long as I can use it for my food item purchase
Or any emergency purpose, religious workers travel by permit
Mega bus merchants public transportation mergers
Good bad and ugly, all wanna grab your money
Brass monkey - uncle Sam be grumpy
He make sounds like star wars Chewy
But this ain't the movies
Trust me - this ain't the movies
Shell cases make beats when they touch the concrete
You might hang from a tree if you don't got a strong fleet
Of course we gon remember you, look what you did
You threw America in a trash can with no lid
Forgive and forget, woah not so fast just yet
Rodney Dangerfield just wanted respect from the powers
