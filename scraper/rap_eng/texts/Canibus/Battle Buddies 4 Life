[Intro: 'Rocky' sample - Jergens (Rocky)]
Would you be interested in the World Championship? (No)
Listen, you believe that America is the land of opportunity? (Yeah)
Apollo Creed does and he's gonna prove it to the whole world by giving an unknown a shot at the title and that unknown is you
He picked you! It's the chance of a lifetime
You can't pass it by

[Verse 1: Dizaster]
My next King of the Dot battle full of arm grapples, bar shackles
All facts, someone gonna get their top snappled
I bottled it all up, but now you gon' get
Your head cut the fuck off just like Saddam's statue
Army commando armed camel all camo AR ammo
In a standoff with Steven Segal and Rambo
Stick your arm out while I'm standin in vantage point 100 yards out
And I blow your hand off like the jackal
Godfather like I'm Marlon Brando, I'm off the bar handles
Lettin' off the bomb shrapnel inside of the god's chapel
Fuckin' with your seed like Monsanto
Sharper than most large panels, spark candles
For the ones that pass away
I cherish everyday cause life is just a large gamble
This is just the wrong channel, rippin' through your ross flannel
Caught in crossfire, turn your block into Los Santos
Los Angelos heart bandit with Canibus on the track
Get caught stranded, no navi or the map candid
You catch me whippin' these cats on an ass-whippin' rampage
I'll throw a fast leg like Johnny Cage minus the black shades
Anderson Silva, how I snap legs, yeah

[Interlude: 'Rocky III' sample - Apollo Creed]
Look man, when you beat me, I hurt all over and I didn't wanna know from nothin' or nobody, not even my kids
Hell, every fighter knows that hurt and we get sick inside trying to live with it
So don't back off now and make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't
We held the greatest title in the whole world
You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons
You lost your edge

[Verse 2: Canibus]
King of the DOT, muscular dystrophy patients inflicted with
Inflammation, barricaded with Oakland Raiders placing wages
Beam him up to my spaceship, where the fuck is ya immigration papers? Don't say shit, soak ya' lips in this basin
You're officially famous I'm officially off the reservation
I'm officially inviting you to my official engagement
Prophetic, Enter the dragon, prosthetic hammers and ratchets
Kalashnikov muzzle flash brass knuckles cracking
Double tap, pop you like bubble wrap, you stumble collapse
Suffering succotash you a sucker for rap
Expendable expert commando merch, doing Rambo work
You think cavity search during a earthquakes hurt?
I walk with a torn ACL, jump on stage with L
I met Dizaster in the cage by myself
The Don Dada Big Poppa do Krav Maga
The Top Shotta shot a red bull off a pi√±ata
The hurt locker first name on the roster, fight you over a dollar
Beat the brakes off a Black Friday shopper
10 million dollar purse flip a coin, who's first?
I'm the referee of this shit, call me Kool Herc
Of the New World Order new earth, choke you with a tire inner tube while American mules drag you through the dirt
Up a hill down the ravine till it's sand wash in my machine
They scratch booty with they hands before they eat
Alphabet savage count from 720 backwards
After 360 lashes I don't need no practice
Marketing promotion distribution and plastics
Digital tracklist, Hip Hop classics, the whole package
I'm Sundance Kid and he's Butch
Assault and battery with high terminology and tenacity
Diz is my battle buddy for life anyway
I put Dizaster vs Marshall Mathers any day, say something

[Outro: 'Rocky III' sample - Apollo Creed (Rocky)]
Listen, it's quiet, isn't it? When you retire, it's too quiet
I mean, we way too young to retire, anyway
Besides, with the right touch, I could promote this thing into the biggest gate of all time
It'd be bigger than ours
Heaven knows I don't mind bein involved with large numbers right?
(I don't need this no more, I don't want this no more)
