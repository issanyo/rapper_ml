[Sample]:
Ladies and gentleman

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I have faith that the youth has to save the day
We gotta let the chips fall where they may
Feud Elvis paved the way, however I'm ashamed to say
The foundation just faded away
I told the limelight bovine in the coalmine
Sometimes it gets so dark your soul can't shine
What you do when justice takes years or more?
But your world is 24 hours from being destroyed
No time machines to tamper inbetween reality
No time for apathy or religious fantasy
Just you against the dragon beast
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
I dont know. That's why I'm asking you
Ima die on my feet like my favorite OG
My favorite OG ain't dead yet, blame it on me
Stay frosty, wake up like "bitch, get off me!"
And I don't calm down till I taste my coffee
The blind man told Batman "No rope"
That's the only way to get outta this hellhole
Just be honest, you made a false positive promise
The rap artists piling up like ocean garbage

[Verse 2: Canibus]
So operative bullnose, full blown turbo flow
You motherfuckers don't deserve no dough
They got a U.S. Republic minority budget
To start a school for Hip-Hop, nonprofit or public
You see, anybody that tells you they coming to save you? Is lying
'Cause you gotta save yourself
No matter what happens in the spiritual world of action
They wanna be compensated to hell
When they deal with they own they pull the trigger too late
But everyone else get dealt with, they don't hesitate
No mercy, no time to marinate
They ain't satisfied till we all living in terror-state
Guess what, we'll get used to it
Ain't nothing new to us
Adapt to the just, that's how we used to do it
Destructive humans, disruptive underground acoustics
They totally destroyed our music

[Sample hook]:

[Verse 3: Canibus]:
Stripped of our honor; laid down to rest in the garden
Martyred, no chance of posthumous pardon
Too bad, ragtop Jag, Sugar Hill swag
Ride around with the top down listening to jazz
'Cause y'all act like y'all so much better than cavemen
But all that knowledge just brought you enslavement
Sentient awareness, removed
Dumbed down in a careless mood, I'm barely amused
So much more pressure than ever
Should the predecessor be more or lesser than their successor?
Good question
Unapologetic regret, questions still go unaddressed
How we feel now is anybody's guess
During this age of iron and widespread gun violence
The puppet masters strings are now wireless
Blindfolded, one more cigarette
What's your last request?
Maybe that life can outlast death
In a metaphor turf war, the all time great work horse
War of the worlds, just for the sport
On the other hand, I got faith, the youth gotta save the day
We gotta let the chips gotta fall where they may
The elders didn't pave the way
I'm ashamed to say, that our future is the future WE made
