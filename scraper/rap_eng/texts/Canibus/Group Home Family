[Canibus]
My dick's like planet Earth, everybody's on it
Used to kick rhymes for free on street corners
Group Home is the name of my organization
We gets busy like phones without call-waiting
Cold killing them, cold blooded reptilian
To rock, none stop, for the millennium
Listen, everyone in my crew be spitting
Eight niggas deep in a Ford Expedition
I rock ice bigger than boulders
My shine be bright enough to give a nigga Glaucoma
Never sober, breaking it down the hardest
The live artists, that beats dead carcass
The C.I.A. wants to murder me â€˜cause verbally
I'm a threat to National Security
With the freestyle instinct, we think quick
And set it off like Jada Pinkett
