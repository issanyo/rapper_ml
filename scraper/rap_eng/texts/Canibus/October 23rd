[Verse: Canibus]
Your rhymes are far from impressive
You got me snoring and I'm not even a narcoleptic
I gotta give you credit
You look like a garbage pail kid descendent
I used to collect them and I see the resemblance
I'll give you ten cents for every time you spit ten bars
Do it five times, you got enough to buy a candy bar
Let me hear some more, you ripped it God
Here's a penny, now get the fuck out of my face, you fraud
Niggas better raise the standards, or get the fuck off campus
â€˜Cause you can't even talk to Canibus
Moved all over the place, I used to rhyme over Miami Bass
But kept moving state to state
I'm a rogue, I'm a warrior on the road
Like them CIA moles, living in shadows
A highly hazardous negro, with a patented flow
Crazier than a Hollywood actor would act on coke
I ain't no joke, ask Rakim
I wouldn't share the spotlight with anybody but him
And the Four Horsemen, the Yang and Yin
We open the can of big bang theory all over again
As deadly as a cobra fang puncturing your blood vein
Or Mad Max behind the wheel of a Mustang
Puffing a hundred and twenty nine octane
Enough thrust to achieve flight like prop-planes
Armed to the teeth like tanks in Iran
Driving like Terminator two through block lanes
You wanna be a thug, you better watch it man
Getting shot can't help u feel 2Pac's pain
After the autopsy they'll just pull out your brain
Put it in a jar you probably won't feel a thing
They go straight to the pawn shop and pawn your bling
This rap industry is such a morbid thing
Country singers live different, their fans got more commitment
They get bigger shipments, big difference
It's a big fitness, and we can learn something
Why would you want to rap forever and earn nothing
I rap like the end of the earth is coming
Grab the mic and act like I wanna murder something
Cursing, fighting or busting like a drunken Russian
Show me a wack emcee and I promise I'll bust him
