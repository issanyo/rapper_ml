[Verse 1]:

Now, let's stay on top of this, let's talk about it
My product and my latest hip hop project
CBD vaporizers, gold plated olmec face
They come with a golden neck brace
Senior technician 401K
Activate, smash your face with the tray-h wrapped around the waist
Then dump you in a dilapidated place
Beat them down with aluminum then I put two in them
The harlem world hooligan with a bad boy shootin them
Throw you off a high rise, see if you can sky-dive
They fear me like ?? black child
Go surgical, chop it up vertical
Bars from my notebook murder you
Can you say "testicular turpitude"?
'course you can't, tongue twister metaphors put you in a trance
In that sunken place doing the drunken dance
Wake up, upside down hung by the pants
While the monster truck transmission crush your hands
Body blows to the guts, stomach cramps, tough man
Im a sheepdog covered by the blood of the lamb
Im hot, my hands are warm my mind is cold
Together they strum notes on the strings of your souls
I was there when they put hip hop under arrest
When the artificial intelligence took its first breath
The boston dynamic mechanics scoured the planet for antediluvian amulets buried in atlantis
The haters just talk shit cuz if i ever break loose they panic
They ain't know i got brain damage
