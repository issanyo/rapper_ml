[Canibus]
Happy Easter, sober transformed into [?]
Rest in Peace to American freedoms
Ceremony takes place in the clouds
A hundred storage facilities forward base built underground
It house all the equipment, it's cold in there
Everybody's digital footprint is stored in there
Our minds are not our own
Our poems are like remote controls, we talk two different homes
Regular negative news, rationale becomes unglued
It's madness to go to war with Sun Tzu
CPU, frozen firewalls, debit card's credit gets robbed
Got the password from your last job
The prisoner's privacy policy says they'll provide security
For your property and do it responsibly
The first in human kind committed was a lie
The second sin was creating a computer that decides
Who lives and who dies? portable polygraphs surprised
No smile, no emotional response
It's not even human to disregard the order to stand down
And exercise nuclear solutions
Control is the comfort zone of the elite rulers
Your life is at the mercy of a computer
Control is the comfort zone of the elite rulers
Your life is at the mercy of a computer
