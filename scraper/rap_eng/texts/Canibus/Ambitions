See, I'm a black man and I don't know how to sing, and I don't know how to dance, and I don't know how to preach to no congregation, and I'm too small to be a football hero, and I'm too ugly to elected mayor...but I watch TV though. And I see as these people in their fine homes and nice cars they drive, and get all full of ambition

They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions

Now if all of was to conjugate, congregate, great will be our escape if we jump at the opportunity
Great Caesar's ghost - I'm so stumped at what you do to me
In the midst of my surrender the picture is painted beautifully, grace the pages of print adds
Granted: been in the game, serving a ten year stint, adds value to the brand
Was afforded the chance to get Canibus to lend a hand
The plan standard was previously set
No emotion shown, stone-faced got you all shook, blurring the vision of every outlook
Being worried about it - pointless in my book
Adjust the blueprint to save face, disgrace past mistakes - but why?
You wasn't honest in the first place
Friends fail, close partners in my proximity
Let hate blind, but still I push on 'cause they can't limit me
Simply to step the stones I stepped on
Dang, that Coff's a tough nut to crack - he black
He just kept on, stronger than the pressure in car tyres, oppression and apartheid
With pride, jello-mesh with the dark side
Dangers of ambition and drive, (of which of I decide?)
To come with the decision the survive and just strive
And '06 from '95 we been promising live
All the fellows say...
All the ladies say...

They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions

If you really want the truth, I'll tell it
They ain't worried about your soul, they want the artist to sell it
They want their image embellished, they want you spending your relish
They want the bottom of the profit line in pluses and swelling
It's ugly ain't it, how the industry's tainted?
And while we never took the title "Gospel rap" and then claimed it
'Cause I'm sick of having sicker flow
Mind-bending time travel, running back, future flow
Ahead of time suture flow, healing for the wounded soul
Deeper than the surfical, snatch it from the reaper's hold
So me and my mans, we form our latent plans to stack you grand and buy a little land too
Hand over hand, 'cause even if we got to, we will hit the block in the van like a rock group

Listen to ambition
No "Can I kick it?"
No time for can kicking when the Canibus spit it
It's the bonafide soldier
My fuel mix, rich like Oprah
She hate hip-hop - so what?
Governor president came to visit the regiment two weeks after the president to give us some medicine
A black bucket of paint blacked out much of my face, blacked out what I wanted to say
Write a rhyme every other day
Coffee keep me up and awake
I'll bust rhymes 'cause I wanna be great before it's too fake and too late
Before destiny meets fate I hear ghost signals in the mix tape
Never stereotype it, it'll be a sound burial tonight if I catch you on a karaoke mic
Clip on my whiskers handling my Gotee business
Call upon your witness
Grits and Canibus spit encrypted Canibus code
Flows tabulated below, amidst bits and notes Germane wrote
Pardon the poor pauper with nothing to offer from his coffer, coughing up a mouthful of volcanic sulphur
Walking towards the altar, hand in hand with my father in law's daughters - my high value target
Force get pitch forked of orbit
Pause it, rewind what I recorded, see if the eye caught it
Five o'clock in the morning, cup of joe boiling - who's pouring?
Bonafide lyrics - who's calling?

They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
They tell me that the world is mine so I keep trying to find the right way to shine, the right way to grind with these ambitions
