[Intro]
Ready on the right, ready on the left
Ready on the firing line
Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!
Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!
Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!
Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!

[Chorus]
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap
When it was exactly that
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap, when it was exactly that
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought

[Verse 1]
Ay yo DJ Premier on the boards
Can-I-Bus, on the bars with the lyrical law
Just listen to the rhymes, don't behave cool to be kind
And I'm a show you how I'm nice with mine
Forced to start from scratch, to rhyme from the heart
When I rap, lookin' forward to not lookin' back
I spit supernatural, look out for the planet-sized shrapnel
Rip The Jacker 'bout to get at you
Rip, and seek, and destroy the motherfuckin' beat mission
The rugged rudeboy, Rasta on 'roids trippin'
Martial arts for the mind, Mandelbrot hip-hop design
You don't understand, stop tryin'
The hip-hop conglomerate, we legends puttin' it down
You gotta honor it, fuck the politics!
The B2 bomb pilot, waitin' for that long silence
Then I was diagnosed with tinnitus
The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I've been through
Nigga I wish it was that simple
The master gunnery combatant blastin' mixtape assassin'
Captain Cold Crush get it crackin'
Heat it up 'til the bones blacken
My microphone double action I grab it, switch the automatic
The savage spittin' it rapid I ricochet 762 jackets
Full metal gold plaque classics

[Chorus]
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap
(Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!)
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap
(Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!)
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought

[Verse 2]
The phonograph fascist, let's see who can reload fastest
You chronograph still in the past tense
Double shot glass of absinthe, still spittin' fantastic
You are absent has been, I'm still rappin'
The Roman gladiator clashin', chariots crashin'
Chest plate split in half with axes, blood splashin'
What you wanna speak about? Let's weed it out
Fore I turn into something somebody gotta bleed about
If I feel the need for speed, do not freak out
Armor upgrade beneath seat mount
No seat belt, breath in, breath out, then lean out
White phosphorus, smoke screen the whole street out
Fire squad gotta reroute, SWAT team can't see now
RPG launch out the tree house
Got a casualty, tell me what the beef is about
He don't wanna talk, let him bleed out, don't need him now
PTSD MC, the kind you read about
Turn the beat up Premier, this is how a beast sounds!

[Chorus]
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap
When it was exactly that
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought
I take it back, back to the golden era of rap
When it was exactly that
Not specifically, jams in the park
But when MC's used to talk with advanced thought

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Mu'fuckers better step up your bars!
