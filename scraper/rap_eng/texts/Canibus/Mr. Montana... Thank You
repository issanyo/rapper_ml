[Intro: M-Eighty]
Yo, Montana?
(Yes I hear you)
He didn’t, he didn’t pick up, uh
Let me try, let me try to get him on the line first and then once I have him, I’ll send you a message telling you to call me back
(Alright man, okay, okay)

[Hook: Canibus]
Mr. Montana, I missed your message
You wouldn’t understand what I’ve been dealin’ with brethren
The sand glass is empty and I ain’t got faith in nothin’
So I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker

[Verse 1: Canibus]
You never fronted, never sold me out
I apologize but that's not what this is about
This is about the direction the world's spinning in
Occupy Hip Hop with Lisa Fithian
The powers that be are preparing for something
They definitely ain't preparing for nothing
I've been saying in my music for years
I tried to educate the audience - my peers
I tried to build with my brothers and sisters
Regardless of color or ethnic religion
Regardless of any financial position
It's tougher than talking to a brick wall
Looking for help to build an Ark before Babylon fall
The fate of humanity is tailor-made
We stuck between a rock and a razor blade
No substance - drunken - blinded by consumption
Marching towards our own destruction
Unawares, unprepared
Open they back - looking for spine, nothing's there, just fear
The horrible beauty, humanity deserves it
To be mass murdered - look at what they worship
Slaves and yet none of this pleases me
You know what I say, "The Dead got it easy"
We're Slaves and yet none of this pleases me
You know what I say, "The Dead got it easy"

[Hook: Canibus]
Peace Nasir, I missed your message
You wouldn’t understand what I’ve been dealin’ with brethren
The sand glass is empty and I ain’t got faith in nothin’
So I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker

[Bridge]
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
The underground ain’t got nearly enough substance

[Interlude: M-Eighty]
Yo, Montana?
He didn’t, he didn’t pick up
Let me try, let me try to get him on the line first and then once I have him, I’ll send you a message

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Conspiracy Worldwide sterilized
Alternative media radio stations got fired
All these little rappers still got dreams
They talk big money but they got beans
The ones who got more they got more because they got yours
Either or they was on all fours
They're all just a bunch of whores
Security can't even afford lunch when they go on tour
The whole worlds a stage, all the way back to the Bronze Age
Man ain't a damn thing changed
So I don't care what they talkin' bout
They lie so much they ain't even worth calling out
They so far past being watered down they got cotton mouth
Bout to be starving from drought
Rap no longer educates the listener
Rap Music just pacifies prisoners
A Bat is just a flying Rat, you a lying piece of crap
Underground rap, nothing but a trap
You saved the world and they don't even know your name, God Rap Music ain't got no graveyard
I wouldn't wanna' be buried there anyway
Fuck YouTube and pennies they pay
You see Montana? This what we up against
If this is all we got, then we ain't got nothing left
Hip Hop used to communicate ideas
That's right I got some smart ideas
I'm gettin' older and in all my years
I never thought music would manifest all my fears

[Hook: Canibus]
Mr. Montana, I missed your message
You wouldn’t understand what I’ve been dealin’ with brethren
The sand glass is empty and I ain’t got faith in nothin’
So I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker

[Bridge]
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
I can’t pick up, I’m in a bunker
I told you, the underground ain’t worth nothin’
The underground ain’t got nearly enough substance

[Outro]
Hi, this is Melanie from Barnes & Noble
Just calling to let you that the books you’ve ordered have come in
They’ll be on hold for you behind the register
Thank you
