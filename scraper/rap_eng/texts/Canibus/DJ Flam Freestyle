[Canibus]
When I say "Can-I," you say "bus"
Can-I-Bus
Can-I-Bus
When I say "Can-I," you say "bus"
Can-I-Bus
Can-I-Bus

Yo
I can kick a freestyle any time you demand it
Brain's high-density and my memory's expanded
Breaking sound barriers like the Lockheed
Even with knock-knees I run across rough terrain at Mach speed
Barefoot, Canibus is crazy enough
Genetically engineering eight-leaved clovers for twice the luck
Canibus is my name, play the freestyle game
Physical brain is in better shape than Jack La Lanne
While you sit and wonder how I just took the life of another
Me and my brother jump in the Jeep and burn rubber
Word to my mother, switch cars, that was clever
She said, "Son, I love you, but they're going to handcuff you"
Cold War veteran, used to assemble weapons for the Kremlin
Disciplined like Olympic gold medalists
Remember this, never ever "F" a chick protection-less
'Cause nowadays what you can catch is very infectious
Lest you got a death wish and you want to mess with
Women who poison the walls of their wombs with asbestos
These streets are treacherous, listen to me when I tell you this
Whatever you're trying to buy somebody is selling it
Somewhere, somehow you get gunned down
When the guns go "blow," just 'cause you were running your mouth
All my people in Toronto say a "no doubt"
You a punk, stop fronting and put the gat down
Kick a rap now, let me see if you can freestyle
Throw on the DAT know, let me show you how to blackout
Next year you'll be walking around the 'How Can I Be Down?' conference with a laminate
That says, "I got played out by Canibus"

[A+]
When I say "A," Y'all say "plus"
A-plus
A Plus
When I say "A," my dogs say "plus
Yo, A-plus
A-plus

Yo, A plus, I gotta be in hip hop shows atrocity
There isn't anyone under 21 that could rock with me
You feelin' this, 48-track ventriloquist
The astrophysicist, passing out the class syllabus
Just imagine,  if I rip your crew into fragments
Destroy the evidence, nobody'll know what happened
Walkin' through the neighborhood full of dead men
Doing head-spins, pickin' 'em up like Redman
Lyrically modified to kick the hottest rhyme at the drop of a dime, I limbo below the bottom line
Kickin' tight rhymes, send Method Man to another lifetime
Keep Erica all to myself, because I like dames
Radiation from the bright shine, meltin' MCs with hype lines
'cause I'm very selfish with my mic time
When I recite mine, my rhymes explode like a pipe-bomb
Nobody in their right, or in their left mind can test mine

When I say "DJ," y'all say "Flam!"
DJ Flam!
DJ Flam!
When I say "DJ," y'all say "Flam!"
DJ Flam!
