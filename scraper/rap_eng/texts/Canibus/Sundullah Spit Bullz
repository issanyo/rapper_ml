[Canibus]

Spitbullz off the muzzle, airborne off the turnbuckle
To touch you, tear bones off the muscle
Stomp you, try to get the swamp monster off you
The awful scent of bloody flesh barnacles haunt you
Couldn't kill me with a 50 cal round of three hundred fifty pound Hound with a canine growl
I scan the road from a mud hole like Rambo
The chain-fed ammo open you up like manholes
I'm Uncle Sambo with a Ku Klux Klan robe
Black face, pink lips Arctic coloured camo
Spitbullz whore let me get a fix on this fool
I drool when it's time to get tool
Six wolves minimum, interrogate before killing them
Water board torture below zero temperature
Hot bars generate sparks, bitch, I told you don't talk
Fibrillate your heart 'til you fart
On your feet, drag you outside, march
Walk 'til your feet parched and your BDU bottoms starch
Feed you pork soaked in sodium salt
Big weapons spark like tuning forks in the dark
Won't tell you again, do not talk when we walk
Do not gawk at the corpse laying on the sidewalk
Handcuffed behind back flesh decompose and crack
Heads are detached from the respiratory tracts
Crossbow buttstock across the throat
Pardon the approach I thought you was walking too slow
No one who is able to hear will care
Those with compassionate care cannot conquer fear
The final battle won't be in space but right here
Thirty two thousand four hundred Maidenhead squares
Sharpshooter assault, Mankind versus The Land Sharks
You don't want none of the Spitbullz
