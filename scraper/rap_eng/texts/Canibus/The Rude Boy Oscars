[Canibus]
What if they mobilize a merk team to your location right now
What you gonna do, how?
Didn't wanna listen when I told you
Now you eating Soybean Tofu and tryna be social
Cold weather index drop, put it in park, stop
They gotta checkpoint every block
Korean car seat head rest, stuffed animals
3 thousand mile traffic that's understandable
Put you in a Shanghai sling cause you be carrying things
Lock you away with PRK Kim
Human nature, animal behavior, they believe in a savior
We were all duct tapped by the taper
Can't wake up and smell roses to heal yourself
You're looking for an opportunity to kill yourself
The undead grabs your leg, kick him in the fucking head
Kick his fucking ass again
The handicapped hunter covered more ground than all the others
We gotta give it to him, that was really something
Out taking a walk Nahanni National Park
Fourteen when I caught my first Goshawk hawk
Now it's time for improvement, 58 wade mount shooters
We sit on the hill and count cougars
We told them about the future none of them cared
Till they went to confiscate his balls, he wasn't there
Peripheral neuropathy, my nerve endings rarely work properly
I can't feel nothing, try stopping me
They do what they do cause they can
They dominate man, every human hominid was scanned
I beg your pardon? I don't know what you talking
Right now from where I'm standing, escape ain't no option
Late August, dry spell
Smoke jumpers jumping outta planes tryna battle fires from Hell
They have the right to blindfold your eyes
Under paragraph five they need you to initial and sign
Transparent policies regarding technologies
Software secure, then again it might not be
The microphone is a Philosopher's Stone with negative and positive poems
Can-I-Bus you probably know him
I make the music, I create it
I don't have to explain it, I don't care if you hate it
It develops slow just like we standing here watching the grass grow
Then some day, out of no where: GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
What you gonna do now yo?
When MRAPs run over the town folk
I'm not the only one that sees it I'm just bold enough to believe it
Predictive policing, they watch you while you speaking and tweeting for so many reasons, seeing is believing ever since the agreement between the humans and the reptilian species
Before the Garden of Eden that bore Prometheus
The Devil is devious cause he's the greediest
Land lizards below, winged ones above
The crude we depend on is dinosaur blood
This prison is perfect, a vacuum inside these gates
Together we created something that escaped
You sold us all out to this alien intrusion
And you got the fucking nerve to call yourself human?!
Tell 'em why you mad, I ain't mad no more
You don't wanna listen to knowledge then that's on y'all
YOU put material items before God
YOU put the evil leadership in charge
YOU were deceived by their villainous charm
And YOU destroyed the constitution's rule of law
One hundred thousand price per share in a uranium mine
Poor lady looks at her baby and cries
Billions of people, slaves to consumption, destruction
You know that God is disgusted
