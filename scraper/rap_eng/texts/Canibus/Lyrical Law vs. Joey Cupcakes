[Verse 1: Canibus]
First things first man, you fucking with the worst
You better bring a ice pack when I see you in person
And I'ma bring a Arsenol, ask Joe who the fuck he talking to
He the softest nigga in the group
Blood thicker than water, wash it off after the Slaughter
Green Hornets, black microphone marauders on set
Break necks without breaking a sweat
People wanna see mic wreck, you wanna tweet texts
I am Hip-Hop Ron Artest, the bars I said
Off with they head, everybody I gon' dead
Who they got, Kid Vicious? You wanna piece of me?
One day we gonna see who's the better emcee
What a tangled web you weave
I'm the only MC the whole world'll ever need
Agreed, you drunk or high? Doesn't make a difference when you die
Couldn't tell you what wasn't on his mind
Saying you the best and not proving it, proves less
Disrespectful piece of shit, I'm coming for you next
Malcolm XOX showing contempt instead of showing respect
That proves his stress, jabs don't connect
Leave his face like Jonah Hex, ice pack cold and pressed
Internet snitching like a little bitch
Joey Low Life, living off rice and goat tripe
He boasts on the mic, then he posts on the site
Then exposed his whole life for the dope, for a price
Don't rep the culture right, sold his soul for the hype
Got known overnight for niggas fucking his wife
Got bust in the eyesight and still wouldn't fight
Bare hands to the gun, to the knife, you a gutless type
I'ma show you what your guts look like
You're a disgrace to Jersey, you suck on the mic
You and 5'9" is like two moist butt wipes
Walking around all uptight, buzzing in the club all night
Two drunken mics hollering, "Thug Life"
You 'bout as bright as a broken floodlight
Can-I-Bus you in the head with a bottle of Bud Light
One love, one life, one shot, one kill gunfight
Joey Cupcakes Budden got a bear cub bite

[Interlude]
"I thought Canibus killed him, but for some reason..."
"What fuckin' reason?"
"Relax, you got your muscles tight. Relax, alright."

[Verse 2: Born Sun]
Stood at thresholds of greatness, impatiently waiting for shine time
As if you need divine mandated
