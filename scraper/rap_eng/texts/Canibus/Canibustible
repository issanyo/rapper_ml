[Intro]
About to put it down for my man
Paradise right here on MP3 dot com, aight
Yeah, check it out yo, uh, yeah
Uh uh yeah, check it, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse]
This is hardcore out of my hearts core
Principle law's equation formulas drawn on chalkboards
Generating thoughtforms quicker than concordes
With onboard computers logged on to Onstar
On guard take ten steps and draw
I'm the lord around these parts respect it dog
Or you might spend a weekend at the county mall
With an unsuitable coffin that's way too small
And the deacon blessing your body at your funeral
You get a twenty one blunt salut and life goes on
Got to stay positive and focus on the protons
And post dope songs on MP3 dot com
As deep as a 2Pac poem, I wish I got to know em
Both him and Big Poppa was the greatest, mighty gone
What's going on, on my album I'ma do a song
Who shot ya remix, featuring Shan and Shaun
Before I battle total strangers I'll make em sign disclaimers
That state they're aware of the danger
See I might become overwhelmed with anger
Split your skull like a banana and bludgeon your face with a hammer
You want to rhyme, fill out this W9
Sign below the dotted line now your publishing is mine
I got to have your publishing rights, hang you upside down
See if you scared of heights, remember Vanilla Ice?
Ask Paradise if I'm nice, I take the train to chambers street
And blacked out on his mixtape twice
Back in 95 I was a tiny guy, you could see the hunger in my eyes
I just wanted to rhyme
And I'm still in my prime, still chasing down what's mine
Still like Dre but Jay-Z ain't writing my rhymes
Quicker than saying hi, quicker than saying bye
Take a flick with some guys and leave before the [?] drives
He was standing here a minute ago the brother replied
With his mind on his money and his money on his mind
Reflecting over the times when I was signed
Selling records for ten dollars, but only a dime was mine
What's the odds of rolling two dice with six eyed [?]
As if there's only thirty six ways to die in these streets
There's a million ways to die at the absolute least
On of those ways is messing with the beast from the east
AKA me, AKA the capital C, Ripper the Jacker with paradise on MP3
Keep it locked y'all
