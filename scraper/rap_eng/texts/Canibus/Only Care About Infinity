Canibus:  Track Six Layer 1!  I only care about infinity!

Voice:  Even now you're trying to rationalize

[Verse 1: Canibus]

Watcha gonna do with no recording equipment
You can't spit shit
100 bars costs you a grid
This is analog lyrical fitness
Mixed with high definition
Mixed with third eye premonitions
It's the business of the illest to ever spit it
Get it?  You don't get it, I ain't got time to sweat it
My chest look like I'm wearing a Batman vest
If I've got a cap on I've got an Ironman neck
Afore slashed breath
He asked how many breaths he have left
I said nothing
The Brotherhood wept
The genii was bottled up I shot at ya
But I was still a philosopher  {​​​​​Rip the Jacker}​​​​​
Three thousand bars later I still know how to bust
Captain Cold Crush [?] who ya trust
I'm too cold to hold, too hot to touch
AKA, AK in the trunk nigga what's up
The Undergods crush the synagogues to dust
Yup crushed to the dust
Bunker buster motherfucker bust
Super weapons like barbed wire blast
Crystal skull amphibians
Navigate millions of light years before nearing our solar system
Peri helium right molecular metal Meridian Syrian
"Are you serious?" No -
Branch Davidians were serious
I'm just sayin if you from Sirius
Show me what Sirius is like
What I've heard got me curious
I'mma smuggle myself there when I find out how
Rip the Jacker oo boy reptile
Black, loud, lyrical, proud
Hysterical sort stage dive crush the crowd, yeah
