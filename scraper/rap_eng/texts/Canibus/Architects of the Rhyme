[Verse 1: Canibus]
You designed it but I destroyed our promise
I'll deploy it, I bomb it then put you in the pine box beside it
I'm still the livest, ain't a damn thing changed but the climate
I got so many bars, I don't have to memorize it
One of Hip-Hop's finest, you shotgun ridin', I'm drivin'
You ran out of gas, get out and start joggin'
Okay I'll make you a promise, you bought my CD so I'ma sign it
But only because you made a deposit
Record labels stealing my profits, CEOs touching toys
Coming out the closet, now they wanna be honest
I drop knowledge like these child molesters tryna drop charges
Justice system so slow, they fucking up the process
I'm a monk in a mock neck riding on a horse named Apophis
There's nothing you can do to stop it
I wanna see you cry for your cut-throat crimes and your lies
I wanna look into your eyes while you die

[Verse 2: CutThroat]
The architects of the movement, murderous reptiles become human
Spit poisonous fluid through music
Take shots of cyanide while I'm designin' the blueprints
Homogeneous, truth is I'm like a diamond to your two cents
CutThroat and Canibus, MCs trying to compare us, blasphemous
25 times hotter than the Sun, when I stare at you it's cancerous
I'm chemotherapy to Hip-Hop, the industry a life support
I cut your chest off and rip out your heart that's what knives are for
Hang MCs on microphone cords
If you don't think I'm one of the best this track is the evidence
I'm possessed like I need a exorcist but my lyrics are Heaven-sent
In my previous life I built the Egyptian pyramids
When I sit down and write lyrics I have an out-of-body experience
My soul's lost in multiple dimensions
Travel through time to come back to recreate my visions
Put a gun to your head and force you to listen
Canibus and CutThroat the definition of real Hip-Hop
This shit just been missin'
