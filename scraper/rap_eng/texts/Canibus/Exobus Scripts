Can-I-Bus

Patriots

Can-I-Bus 1:1: I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth and pull then I feed you to the pit bulls

Can-I-Bus 1:2: Don't even talk about guns
The only 9 you got is a $5 bill and 4 ones

Can-I-Bus  1:3: So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
‘Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochets

1:4 Rhyming with me on a record?
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven

1:5 ‘Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions

1:6 In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection

1:7 Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode

1:8 Explode, leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in
