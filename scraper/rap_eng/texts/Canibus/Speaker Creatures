[Verse 1: Canibus]

I was born in Jamaica, reincarnated by the Creator
I crawled out of a meteorite crater
Bat-shit crazy, I feel like Hip Hop hate me
They erased me & my sanity escaped me
Sumerian, Israelian, mammalian mixed with alien
From the constellation of Aquarius
The logo was branded on the back of the savage
Who demanded your daughter's hand in marriage for sex magic
The light glows on the Agate, rock in the cabin
She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric
The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot
He's also her best friend who pretends to be a faggot
Next passage: death is a language, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Coronating metaphors with my sword and scepter
I was never the best, just corrupted by the weight of success
Could've been more productive with less breath
I translate codes, animate ones and zeroes
To sideways 8 'til something great unfolds
These are the Psalms unknown, reborn to the bone, it feels wrong
Look at these rags I have worn
Burn Hollywood Burn, they tried to trick them
I've probably 'Spit a Billion' bars before this one
Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night
I memorize the movements of the lights
Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart of the Sephiroth sloth
That can make you bleed thoughts
So be advised, my rhymes override the mind
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
I'm heavyweight slim face, I breathe when the wind breaks
Breast plates move when I give chase
Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait till I get up in your base camp
You gon' have to face the champ
Roman shield is composed of a rose colored stone
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot
If the target ever stands in one spot
Tentacles form a loose noose, hang your ass off of the roof
Suffocate you 'til you mourn for a truce
Introduce you to my people, stick you with some needles
Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles
Go to sleep people, I'll watch why they feed off your evil
And meet you in the motherfucking 'C'-Quel

[Hook 2: Canibus]

You [got?] that God is dead
You [know?] that God is dead
This is the end of days
This is the end of days
