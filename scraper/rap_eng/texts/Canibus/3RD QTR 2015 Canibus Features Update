[Verse 1: Canibus]
We some turtle tree smoking Cyclops raiders roaming with Logan
Drink from the ocean, howl at the Moon
After cesium exposure, launch homing missiles off of the shoulder
Spider drones blow the front doors open
Kick your picket fence over, shoot up the engine block motor
Explosion, fire extinguish the chauffeur
They say black lives matter for sunrise sacrifice on the Sabbath
Is this a floating city or a sinking palace?

[Break: Wrestling commentary samples]

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I focus on one thing, the sound of insects crunching
Refugees barefoot hunting
Wars and rumours of wars, dullahs wearing scrubs doing chores
Delivering new bars on the floors
Small cities under the surface, shadow government purpose
Over medicated population make 'em nervous
Relocate, recover, retaliate
Bloodthirst for the solar sunburst, I salivate
Purple lips call me amethyst face
Driver says, "Whatever it takes, just don't let Canibus escape"
Coyote wolf, hybrid breeder, 3D print lower receiver
Pass it to my ominous leader
Short term speaker, long term dreamer, Massachusetts, Medina
Nigga got more excuses than FEMA
Baking in my bugout bag, my dog tail wag
Three days a week, I'm at Full Sail class
Allahu Akbar Ferrari world snack bar
The return of 19th galaxy rap star
Mirror mirror on the wall, sing to my broad like Aaron Hall
My name tattooed above bra
My logo tattooed barely above drawers
Love it to see she didn't get nothing stupid like dog paws
"Just you and me" castaway key
Nice room, 2 G's, blue seat, cool breeze
It's takes 720 degrees to move me
360 degrees is food for the beast
K-Solo, Canibus unique, Kevlaar kids, big beats
Born Sun peace, god peace

[Sample: Unknown artist]
I just handed a mic
You should save yourself
I just handed a mic
Run for your life
I just handed a mic
Bring you to the Guillotine
Bringin' you that  [?] dramatic

[Verse 3:  Burns]
Hey yo
Smoke a blunt a cigarette and drink a brew before breakfast
Drunk before lunch and walk around like I'm headless
Hip hop scholar not the best that should test this
Cause Burns is a force that you don't want to mess with
What's with the stuntin' do not know [?]
Got a crew big enough to clock ya stop ya proper
Bout to bring the pain
Bigger than the movie Clockers
And they'll be sick of my name
Til they need to see a doctor
Fat rhymes flat lines
Travelin' at mock speed
Metaphors mega roar
Leaving niggas knock me
Sing a Hail Mary to the one who's trying to Pac me
Cause Burns got that rock that's top
With hip hop speeds

From "King of Tallulan"

[Intro: Earl Hazard]
Say Bis
Me know I'm not ready for the fire, sin
Given that Saddam bomb fire Rude Boy that ruckus
Sin?

Earl Hazard
King Talula
Acronym NWC (is it me?)
Niggas With Computers
Big horn trombone tubas
Ethanol front lawn movers
Catepillars with blowers
Comin out the hood loofahs
Pink boots not cheap loops
Fire belt seat belt harness
Low cage, I don't need no booth
Sheriff
Gregory Peck
My eyes wide open all the time even if I know the enemy's dead
Here's the thing Capital C
Close quarters rap with the beat
Music casualties don't matter to me
Can-I-Bus nom de plume
Rip the Jacker rendezvous'
A brave new world
Drop they shoes
It's Headquarters
Sheep to the slaughter
Vinegar IP
No water
Potassium burns your veins til you holler
Banana man selling bananas from banana stands in Afghanistan
Bartered bananas with the camera man
I'm the hammer man any which way you can
Eastwood Callahan
What's so funny fancy pants?
It's a battle staff warm-up
Reserve contingent callin' em up
Poorly trained, no guts, they all suck
Hot day agalo agalo
Plant my plantanos
Primer de sabado de el jefe vamanos
I'm a son of a bitch black baboon silver back raccoon
In the shit-hit-the-fan chat room

Magnus Sebastian
Canibus  [?]
Assassins
Poetry manifest action
I've got a dove faced grill
My face shaped like snowplow sill
Snowmobile tank tracks for wheels
I say respect to the nth degree to the fullest
Give em mercy with a bottle of water
Or a bullet
Hard body buff, bad rotator cuff
Motivated to get going when the goin' get rough
They call me Canibus Electronica
Pneumonic
I recover rare earth metal drunk electronics
No matter how you slice it
We meet our fate
The ruling class says let them eat shit layer cake
Nano lithium powered
I sit atop trillium tower
Counting every single invisible hour
Automaton automated foo fighter formations
Standin' ovation
Poet Laureate of the Nation
I play my part for this law star
Rock tar par plot
Shit when I sit with the pop tart
Nip to tune per miss mock tot
Flare no qui velo [?]
