(Intro: Killah Priest)
Tired of playin' with this corny-ass mothafuckas, knowI'msayin?
Yeah we talk shit but we can back it up, knowI'msayin?
We gon' bring the pain... yo fuck that!
Yo, yo...

(Killah Priest)
I'm the throat slitter, the .44 spitter
A disrespectful nigga, punch your mother and I'll fuckin' kiss her
Slam her body on the hook then I skin her
From her stomach till it shows her liver
In the middle of the winter, puncture heart/eyes with a splinter
Leave the blood dripping from her raggedy house slippers

(Goldie Mack)
I'm a tote steel nigga, a blow steel nigga
Fuck what you heard, I'm a Brownsville nigga
A straight name nigga, a straight aim nigga
I straight line up and just bang bang niggas

(Canibus)
Yo, I'm all work and no play, twenty four hours a day
The way Canibus trains makes the Green Berets look gay
You going to war with savages, niggas who ain't having it
A million Africans scalping you faggots into cabbages

(Elohim)
Basically it all illy, my 9 milli spray, have you smelling like bagushi
We'll be getting pussy
Grizzly chested, I smoke method, yapping my Isis
Riding the whip without a licence, I soul with the nicest

(King Solomon Rose)
It's King Solomon Rose, I swallow the flows
You sliding them hoes, my style invented, mercury froze
With gat in your nose, I ride with my foes
Don't try to pose, ammunition by the Rose Kartel

(Goldie Mack)
Ready to meet the words worth, you know the sickest come first
I think I need a nurse, talk slick, I think you need a hearse
I leave you murked as I watch your body feed the earth
Then I splurt in case the D's infiltrate my turf

(Bloodthirst)
I be B-L-double O-D T-H-I-R-S-T
Standin 5'8' with the great knockout
Once your team amped out, they be fronting like they thugged out
Until they see the chrome racked out

(King Solomon Rose)
Who's the first to challenge, or where's the challenge?
I spit a verse so powerful enough to put the Earth back in balance
Who's the first to kill, the first with steel
The first time I spit I knocked the Earth upon its axis tilt

(Canibus)
My niggas is too high to get over, too low to get under
Too wide to get around and too silent to puncture
Black gods, black bulls, rap stars that attract y'all
With the gravity of a collapsed star

(Goldie Mack)
I drop jewels like the Matrix, twelve of them
I rock shoes like nobody could take it to Hell with them
I'm gully, I'm the mayor, the favourite
Most racist, most wanted, yo I'm outrageous

(King Solomon Rose)
Yo the skies blinded, I'm high minded
My brain make it rain triple five storms
Idolize the thorn when I spit a load of clips are formed
Born to slash you, infinite logic, Sha salute to smasher

(Elohim)
Straight gangster, send to bang ya
Grab the .44 and rearrange you, fuck the hook, I'm off the hanger
Extreme danger, take caution
Cut the pie, give me the bigger portion, what I spit it awesome

(Bloodthirst)
Tossing 'em from the rooftop, pop slugs out of Rugers
Whatever comes towards, I'm ready for us, spill alcohol
For my last fam, this is war, peace to can't miss
I love my team more than I love my bitch

(Goldie Mack)
Just me and my bitch, just me and my clique
On the grind, spilling the fifth with gangster shit
Nigga what a gangster spit will lay you down
I touch my pound, violent, I shut you down

(Canibus)
Yo, I shut down my enemies with telepathy electrically
My verbal chemistry can kill you with esoteric energy
I bury motherfuckers in the cemetery for testing me
Yelling, 'fuck you,' with all my niggas adlibbing me

(Elohim)
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck her
Fuck niggas who think I sound cursed, matter of fact, fuck the whole Earth
I'll be blood thirstin', urban, like I'm the fucking worst
Ever since my motherfucking birth
