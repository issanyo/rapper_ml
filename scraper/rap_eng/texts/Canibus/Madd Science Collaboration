[Verse 1: Canibus]
I sit on a throne of mastodon bones
I hear slaves moan tryna master the poem
Arms fold into bar codes
While programs probe the unknown mold of the old
Live in the flesh, 50 reps of 5 sets
Give me Melly Mel biceps
I advise why test, I twist the 5-5-6
Body armor inside the chest
Scouts dismount search hideouts from the south
I know the supply routes inside out
Timeout, sign-in wild out
The connection died out, time to sign-out
Thin recruits, black boots and ninja suits, shoot
My shot group injure two troops
I alleyoop boots on the roof
Crawl into mach suits count to two and drop through
Fit, dog shaped, chiseled from the face to my waist
SWOL like a log in the lake upstate
Custom plates rotate to one that's fake
Long enough to run to the base
Mask over the face escape, report to Peter Pace
The Blackhawk ten minutes late
Little birds hover in space, pick me up
We celebrate, I greet'em with a brotherly embrace

[Verse 2: Madd Science]
Authenticate, Madd Science in the place
I'm dead if I'm late so you never got away
I stand 5 foot 8, terracotta soldier shaped face
Science from a very mad place
Bypass the electric gate with duct tape
There's no time to wait, the sign shift shape
Earthquake, audio wake, high WiFi spit rate
Sunny side up egg yolk on my plate
Madd Science, six figure appliance
House fires, I did it with pliers, tripwires
Pyrotechnic desires, Interviews with Vampires
About spiders infected with the bird virus
My investors seem bias
Half Russian submarine pirate, codename Ivan with a dive kit
Regulate pints of spit, a world underwater
My plasma stay white to the tip
Grip gravity with gloves on, enter with guns drawn
Hammer to thumb bone I'm playing the trombone
Strings unfold with a drum roll
Tell you the unofficial story Rumsfeld's sons told
I sat down, he stood up, one spoke
He had a rope tactical under his coat

[Verse 3: Canibus]
My safe zone is a space dome
USA made mold brain insulated with foam
Asphalt frequent flyer, ex Navy Seal diver
Strike a fire in sidewinders
Drifting through dividers on four tires
Forced to retire from my roll over priors
The snake whisperer, the ripper of your viscera
Tongue blisterer with whisker burns still at work
