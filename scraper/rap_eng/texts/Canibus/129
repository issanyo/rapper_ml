Emcees

They put 'em in a line
(Murray)
They hit 'em with the
(Sample)
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2
(Canibus, while Murray raps in the background)
Til the meter says 9-9-9

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Ya'll try to hit 'em with the bada boom bada bing
Ya'll remain slaves
We remain kings
Fall back haters let us do the damn thing
Damn, don't blame us, God gave us this hang
He made it bang bang
So we shot like bling bling from here to
Every dark cell in Sing-Sing
I've never been a hater, I'm a nigga-lover
I'll bite off the face of Dog the Bounty Hunter
I'm a mover and a shaker, you a born loser
Come through it though you win the Heimlich maneuver
Your chick she a Hoover
My dive begin scuba
I'm a DOG spelled backwards though, eat, oo, ganooba
Ah, patch it up like Slick Rick the Ruler
We got [ ] broadband with gooder computer
What the - hooter?! Blast off like a luger
My squad be "Disturbing Tha Peace" like Luda!

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
One millennium later, I'm still a cannibal
Hands free answerable, memory expansible, sample you
Question you, answer you, dismantle you
To examine you in the flight path, a light craft
If my rhymes climb height too fast you might crash
Tried to get through ( ) you tape Benazir Bhutto
The assassin got too close
Search party found a body, no prints, just nobbies
Corpse smell like pastrami, anybody care to stop me?
The mic's out of tune, tell the sound engineer
'bada bing bada boom' sound check one two
You, what were you thinking? Who the fuck cares about lyrics?
How can this even exist?
It's the smiley face attached to the paper next to the gun rack
Copenhagen did six sets of tracks

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Been in these streets for years, it made me an animal
So it's understandable when I make you a vegetable
Respect our step, step-by-step
Mechanical, give you something you could feel more real; more tangible
Comin against us, you're gonna get your ears full
Get knocked down from the blindside like Suge
When freestyle or written, we some Mike Tysons
Y'all talk shit and apologize like Mike Tyson
[i know that there are some errors here, if anyone wants to fix it, go ahead]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Cannibalise the kid spitting something that is fit for consumption
Some niggas hate it some niggas love it, the shot which make you stiffen your stomach
A thousand bars of running, you still tryna spit a hundred
Too stubborn to see the UnderGods coming
At Robert Lange Studio pressing buttons
Plugging microphones in and busting, Big Punisher never punches
I don't know how he does it, but he would be proud of it
Canibus, Keith Murray, UnderGods, we coming!
