[Verse: Canibus]
1000 omeros, gringos [?]
5 scar [?] crew come from Jamaica
For work pay me for the beat with my verse over the combined work and no matter who rhyme, I rhyme first
The MC who can rhyme like me, bring him to me
And tell him what ever he does, don't sing for me
Backtrack create better raps or face the executioners axe
Who  execute you 'cause your music is wack
Now I could say the ruler is back
But that's Slick Rick's rap, so I'ma pay homage like that
Get busy over beats that break the boom bap
Come correct black, I just harpooned the track
The reverb of the sound will hunt you down
The lyrics get you so high you can't come down
He didn't get far his ash tray is still warm
The bar's he was writing cut off in mid thought
He said his world was so small he talked to the walls when he's bored, when they start to talk back he was gone
Beyond where he began to be the rhyme
And the rhymes began to cross through the arteries of time
This is nonsense, no this is lyrical content
The zombies spit a billion bars after the sound check
Don't show me nothing I don't wanna see
Don't ask me to spit something if I don't wanna speak
He tried to take so he took it to his wake
No matter who you try to blame it's too late
How it feel to be on the other side of this rhyme
Where everything or anything is mine
For a moment I was the illest MC
Now that moment is of no interest to me
I only care about Infinity...
Lyrically I care about Infinity and my dreams
Seeing it for real show me what Infinity means
I had to force myself, then I endorsed myself
To get away from the source of the discourse I felt
I mean, how long you gonna run around saying a nigga can't spit
How many Canibus clones up in this bitch?
How many mixes was made from that Poet Laureate Infinity shit
I wouldn't be surprised if he quit putting albums out but his              clones continue to spit, microphones continue to get Ripped
You can't say nothing about him lyrically
He only care about Infinity
