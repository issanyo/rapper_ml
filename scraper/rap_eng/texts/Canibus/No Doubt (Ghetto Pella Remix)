[Canibus]
702 remix
Three chicks, brothers is dying to be with
But I need chips so I can reinvest in a whip
Then I'll add another six cylinders to my V six
And pick you up in the V twelve, SL
Much better acceleration now, can't you tell?
Canibus is the name, can't you smell
Spitting game you can't rebel
And lower your defensive ( A )

[Canibus]
Come on, you can't ignore that your feeling so strong
You even told me you don't want to be alone, anymore
But as soon I close the door, you start saying no
You ain't sure, then what you come home with me for?
Girls be getting me bored, asking me if I know the Lord
Like all I want to do is get in their drawers
( B ) the Motown man, this is how we get down man
