[Verse One: Canibus]
Yo, me and Jurassic 5 in a chromed out Navigator
Counting paper, who wanna taste the new flavor?
We go hard like terrorists smuggling bombs
Blow up a plane fuselage with the president on board
Starting problems, bringing drama regardless
We get our points across like a trapeze artist without falling
Twin turbine rhymes with 4 thousand pounds of thrust
Can-I-Bus, Can-I-Bus
If you one of them niggas that only trust what you can touch
When you see me give me a pound and shut the fuck up
No diggity, I smack rappers silly for drilling me
Lyrically
The hardcore metaphor war trilogy
With the verbal chemistry punks can't understand
How Canibus kills a man with less than 10 lyrical milligrams
Of the illest jam you ever seen or heard
Special operatives rocking this to get the proper burn, what!

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Canibus is above the law I make cops shit in their draws
They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved while you pray to Allah
Reading your Qur'an and your teaching of Muhammad
I'm in my crib studying thuganomics
Punks wanna murder me
That's why my Burgundy Suburban be
Full of Secret Service security
Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action University and aircrafts to take off and land vertically
The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me
From the streets of Dirty Jersey to Germany niggas heard of me
Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort
I get drug tested before I can rhyme on the record
Remarkable specimen
With an audible weapon
Processing lyrics in less than one hundreth of a second
Beef, bring it
Bullets in barrel, spin it

[Verse 3: Canibus]
After nonsense I got the reinforcements to crush any enemies offense
With a hundred thousand horsemen
The hardest muthawat, on the market right here
I complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra terrestrial biological entities waiting for the energy battling for world supremacy
Who wanna get touched?
The Can-I-Bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushing MCs, jumping out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Integrating you whack MC's like like MIB's with dark glasses
Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed by flashing
Bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras so when you revived you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps SABS on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic and take advantage of opportunities to do damage
I'll pierce you'r heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster than the speed of light, is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark that'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies with the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity
With is actually what happens to any wack MC for battling me

[Verse 4:  Canibus]
I'm a nuclear warhead
Right now you're provoking my detonation
Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience will cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like an air bag
Your rhyme is fake
Your brain is child's play to manipulate
I create lyrics too  intricate to imitate moving at a velocity
That'll break you'r stop watch if you're clocking me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji but iller than what you've seen in the cinema
A five foot eight nigga with more horse power than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin pentium tips
That's double the clock speed of a 586
And nothing about  my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavors beyond what you'r tongue is capable of tasting
You'll be surprised you won't believe you'r own eyes
It's like explaining color to man that's born blind on of a kind
I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm will scramble the eggs of a woman's ovaries
Cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect
Niggas that copy  like double decks
I get vexed
When crab punks bite my style cause I'm selling a thousand records per day per square mile
Breaking the law of physics with metaphors and lyrics speaking to dead poets by conjuring up their spirits
From Shakespeare to  Edgar Allan
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around with the talent
Much less understand it
I make tight rope walkers at the circus loose they balance when I kick the planet!
