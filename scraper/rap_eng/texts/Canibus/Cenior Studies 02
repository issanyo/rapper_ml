[Canibus]
Yo, the artists come and go, so does the show
So does the dough, nothing lasts forever you know
It's all about the experience and what you take from it
What you learn in the process, what you make of it
Number two in the world at the top of the summit, I loved it
Should have packed a parachute for the plummet
Now I'm opening these clips crawling through mud pits
With guns and hundreds of clips on Uncle Sam's budget
100 Rifles itself, handcuff Burt Reynolds to Jim Brown
And escape with Raquel Welch
Isn't my queen lovely? Feed her rum and raisin ice cream
Shower her with diamond rings and money
23 hours a day I study
Dreaming about beautiful women, I hate you gay Teletubbies
Dreams keep me alive you can't take them from me
The battlefield is bloody, mean and ugly
My adrenaline rushes when the enemy rush me
Trying to bust me cos I swore I'd defend my country
If I could choose between being lucky and having money
Nothing negative could ever touch me
What must be is ultimately not up to me
But I sacrifice my life for yours if you trust me
Pin my medals upon my chest
So I can left-right-left into certain death
Godspeed and God bless
In the end I hope God is impressed if I'm put to rest
I did what I came to do, no time left
Say my name out the blue cos I rhyme it the best
MicClub.net see me live in the flesh
You could come and download every rhyme that I spit
You could pay homage to Rip for one dollar a clip
None of those rhymes are on the album, bitch
It's a storage facility where I keep my shit
For the students in the class that wanna peep my shit
Break a bootlegger leg if he leak my shit
You don't wanna sign in bitch then eat my shit
Drink my piss, you could never compete like this
I'mma give you an example how deep I get
Technology not available for purchase
My brains collects, stores and converts million bar verses
At a stand-off distance of a thousand feet
I illuminate the target and pound em to sleep
To within one micro-inch if you out in the street
I could close my ears and still move my mouth to the beat
Dial-up to your network and make your files delete
Count to three, listen to your browser beat
Too late, foot already stepped in the feces
Dr. Norton's too sick to help your PCs
Virtually I make your virtual memory freeze
With a Weapon of Mass Destruction - WMD
I'm a TMC - Trouble to MCs
Destroy colonies with UCAVs
I send in no less than twenty A-Teams
Wipe you out before I even get to the beach
With my Transatmospheric spcae based mirrors
Can you write that out without typographical error?
Dumb fucks I'm the best ever whatever
Divide 18 by 6 you get the third letter
From the lowest earth orbit up to the heavens
I bomb y'all with lyrics of flesh shredders and petters forever
As a spitter I'm still tougher than leather
I had to go underground to get over the pressure
Battle rap from the Renaissance multi-megawatt
Bury you beneath the bedrock on the bed of rocks
I could never get bored
I write about Huxley vs Wilberforce, fuck writing killer chorus
Copenhagen curriculum of metaphors
Everything from Bob Marley to Tenor Saul
The System of A Down song number 14
I see 'Aerials in the Sky' when I dream
The end is near I wish it would hurry up
I feel nanobacteria burning me up
Before I explain in detail
You should examine the Mahr's mineral samples under my nails
Sometimes I wonder who's listening
The auditory Pavlovian conditioning's so sickening
My adenine, guanine, cytosine
And thymine is really what makes my rhyme supreme
Soon as I hear the beat, bada-bing
You gotta think: a hundred bars...damn, that's a lotta ink
Eventually all of my albums will be out of print
There'll be a clone for every style I invent
For every line I rhyme intense
For all the time I spent, every word I spit since 96
If you could input at a hundred
I could output way above it, if we in public, I double it
Put this on your study list and go study, bitch
Basically quoting Hammer "U can't Touch This"
I'm too assertive and alert for what its worth
My best piece of work is still yearning to be birthed

Cenior Studies from Canibus

[Outro (Recording of an author)]
There is something mystical, but it's not RARE
And nobody should treat it as though this is something special
That writers do... anybody--anybody born physically able in the brain
Can sit down and begin to write something and discover
That there are depths in her soul or his soul that are untapped
