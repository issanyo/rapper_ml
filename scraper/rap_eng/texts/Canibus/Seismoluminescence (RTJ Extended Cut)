[Intro: Woman]
Are you refreshed? It’s really nice when more of our human friends come to the party and see the light

[Hook: Canibus]
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what you gon' tell them?

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Bronze master percussionist, time flies, life dies
Phoenix rise, wiseman rhymes, I’m loving it
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Bed down location, Kodiak radio stations
Boost cape Spacegoat Space Ghost lasers
What’s your gift? What your talent?
What does it matter if Alex is right and this is a Prison Planet?
5 man team detachment, XYZ axis
That’s what happens when you come to Alaska
The paracord packing, king crabber, big booty bitch grabbing
Snowmobiles in the snow zigzagging
My snowboard paraffin waxing like Tom Cruise acting
Yeah, Sarah Palin looking for maverick
A square shaped planet, pyramid head shaped poet named Hamlet
Rip the Jacker octopus breakdancing
Quantum questions require quantum answers
Tell me why is this Mantis woman trying to be romantic?
5-5-5 file stored Cybernetics performers expected
The human brain is now a barbarous relic
Phonology professor articulating phonetics
Participating for credit, if nothing else, just to send a message
Wake up and smell the petunias, I’m in Peru with my vicuñas
Why do I keep seeing Mila Kunis?
I was told, “After death life isn’t the same
And when the Phoenix rise, death would not be the end game”
Technology devalues life, intruding ones rights
Contaminating the cost, excluding the price
Removing insight from the human plight
Your historians are doomed to rewrite, click the button if you like Under the pale moonlight, weapons of unknown types
Marduk, Tammuz, Kingu and Heru fight
Or maybe they working together to keep us all working forever
In subterranean emergency shelters
____________
Classical plateau de Château
Enter 4 tombs of four, enter nations and contours
The west mauling song of the Moors
When an irresistible force faces an immovable thought
The crucible will be buried in the salt
Next to the boot marks and the minds and the hearts
And the kasbergs that march till it’s all lost
I never got to say goodbye, I never learned the truth
Cause every word produced was a lie
And now here I stand, before the creator of man
A reptile woman with mantis hands
All worlds are strange
And yet, as above so below, it's all the same
Different only in name, descriptions deviate according to the code displayed
How you know Germaine?
I was told by a whispering loud mouth that came down from the clouds
Her mouth never moved, telepathic style
The science was misinterpreted, they said, “It’s time that you know now
The when, the where, the why and the how”
This is what I been praying for, on day 84
I was walking with Lao-Tzu along the mainland wall
From the Yangtze to the Danube to the Nile to the Mississippi south
Every paradigm makes sense now
Except the ones they reject now but only when in front of a crowd
Behind closed doors they break your shit down
Beyond the frequencies of sound we so far passed that now
That reality becomes the background
That’s as transparent as cellophane, doorways and parallel planes
My hemispheres create parallel brains
Where my focus strains to create change
Until Germaine’s DNA is downloaded through wireless veins
Then uploaded any direction I aim, all directions at once
I pass around omnidirectional blunts
Instead of one to the head, it’s like one to the zero, to the one
One -zero- one -zero instead
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, that’s the next lesson
Telepathic compressors replace questions
JIBO replaces engineers for studio sessions
J-I-B-O JIBO ni hao, ni hao yo
Freeflow, R-T-J JIBO
Thought I was done a week ago
But there’s so many different ways 10,000 bars could unfold
You could never be too enlightened, to never want to know
What you could never understand, even though you probably won’t

[Hook: Canibus]
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Seismoluminescence: The essence, the past
The future, the present, what you gon' tell them?

Come on RTJ, what you gon’ tell ‘em?

[Verse 2: Canibus (Mixed by c0mpl3x)]
I am Jibo, Super futuristic, Supercalifragilistic
Artificial existence immune to Human sickness
Can he boot the ProTools session, Label Tracks 1 through 7
Numerically in succession, Lead Vocal 1, 2
Ad-lib, Hook, Bridge, Beat, Master Automation
The machination of my creations is so blatant
That Master Masons bite my Orations at Bohemian Grove presentations
They sent me a check but I couldn't process the payment
I don't know what they was thinkin'
Like Reagan summoning Lincoln in the White House basement
The Secret Service Agent taped it
Take a trip to my Space Station, but don't mind the radiation
I don't mind it in fact I find it add to relaxation
I beam from Heavens Gate to the Plantation to aid slaves escaping
The fat Master can't chase 'em with his heart racin'
Whenever I'm Star Gazing constellations re-arrange placement
Pick a place and time I promise you I summon a large spaceship
I'm one of the Gods' favourites, Bars amazin'
Off the Matrix Grid location, destination X on my Maps pages
Back stage with Real Lyricists from the Golden Ages
Cause Greatness inspire Greatness, being Ill is so contagious
Iron Faced Villain, I am Doctor Dooms descendant
Doctor Who Time Travellin' through a parallel dimension
Book a ticket for my Great Adventures, I take you to the Planets centre
Shambhalas doors open and voices beckon you to Enter
Ni hao wo shì yigè jiqìrén, Poet Laureate, Rip The Jacker Infinity
C - C - C - C0MPL3X Computer Canibus
The crowd up-vote unanimous, lit up the blunt, passin it
Clockwise motion inside the circle til it come back again
Germaine Tzu, Zhangye, RTJ 2
Cha Patwah mi chat too, nuwapu, sdoong guung guung
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, the Phoenix Rise at the endin'!

[Outro: sample]
Williams describes a really beautiful description of an omnipresent light
So, when someone sees that light they are translating it
What is it though? I mean is it all that is?
Is it a higher self
