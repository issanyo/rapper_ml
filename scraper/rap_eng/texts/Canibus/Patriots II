[Verse 1: Canibus]
Espionage light fog with night goggs on an Oil Rig Barge
With 10 frogs and the Sarge playing cards
Just another day on the job, we draw straws
To determine point guard, they got stripes, we got stars
Legendary spit 1776
It's no option for the enemy to quit
Every hit is uplinked to a memory chip
Every 1 minute, 10 seconds, 70 ticks
Welcome to the top of the Earth, your compass don't work
I'm tellin' you where we are but you're still not certain
A verse Colder than killer cobras over Jehova
Delta soldiers in camouflage colored Kubotas
Free-fall off the snow cliff before the pole shift
Delay pulling your rip cord long to get the closest
Master of the azimuth, codename: Captain Classic
Transmit back to Sergeant Radcliffe
Soldier Stone came up with an excellent tactic
Here's a FCBC2, now you practice
Astro-like plastic, blast squad automatics
Nobody can match it, I demolition rappers
I know you elite, I know what you doing
I know who you are, you know where I'm going
The ripper paints the picture
Lyrically drawn it in Cartesian coordinates, I'm already bored of it
Give me a sec, pause the shit
Take a breath from your waterboard torture on the top of the monolith
Divine lineage lines, split from divine
Neuropeptides get high off millennium wine
Female gender search, predator lurks in a black hearse
Through the desert dirt to the end of the Earth
Climb aboard the vessel of an unknown metal
Controlled by offroad rebels working for the Devil
I'm a patriot, I say it like I mean it
Said the whole rhyme using circular breathing
Are you a patriot? Say it like you mean
Tell them how you train even when you on leave, D

[Interlude: Canibus]
I'm a patriot, I'm a I'm a patriot

[Verse 2: D One]
Yo Bis I train between spotlights and where the toes tip
Through the pain, see my one and only blow me a kiss
I'm the young vet hungry for next, peep the pressure build
In memory of old burial hill
Flyness dressed to kill, bitch never misjudge
What the kid got under his belt
City slicker, Rip the Jackers, allegiance is born
The more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in war
Upper body cut, always on the run feet are sore
Read more, better myself, teach em' all
Freedom fighter, paranoid of tabloids, Midnight Rider
With the five o'clock shadow, bad boy
Clothes black, avoid close ties, stay on the move
Legendary the name, the face like Deja Vu
Modern Benjamin Martin, marksmen, we elite
You a weed in a gentleman's garden
Luck of the Irish is mixin' with Mexican boxin'
Hate on a patriot, we get offended in Boston
Renegade I been in trainin' since '98
And I'm ready waitin', got 'em behind the eight ball, it's over
That's all soldier, said it like I meant it
The heart of history, give me liberty or a death wish
