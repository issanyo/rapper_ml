Aiyo Sarge, my SuperFriend's Dodge in the yard
Don't say a fucking word to me just nod
I came, I see
Then I'ma bust him in the jaw if he fuck with me
MC cbc, atl, ebe
Mickey D sign, he see me
I see more depth than Imhotep
I see no death, that's why I ain't no hero yet
Translate the text I throw scrolls you fetch
My style is not even something unknown yet
I'm a SuperFriend, come through in a stupid Benz
Look at the roof, you see blue wind
That where the tape ends but a new loop begins
I can't believe what they do for ends
Nigga nuck if you buck, cap if you puck
I bust out of these cuffs, grab your ass up
Reach for the light, I'ma show you despite
You can X-Ray my hand and see me holding a mic
