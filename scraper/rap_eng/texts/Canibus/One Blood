[Verse: Canibus]
The dark ruler in the dark blue Star Cruiser
A very large Bravada and a parked Dodge Charger
Who art thou Father, the mini gun chopper sing opera
You out of air, get you when you pop up
Iron Lung's wire tongue tied fungus up in a bun
Germaine strain H5N1
Horse tranquilliser rhyme stud, I designed the buds
Make your rhymes shrivel up to lime rust
The bombs lay stacked on the floor above the door
Of the Bombay, I can drop bombs all day
Spit over Boom Bap till tooth crack
I got tooth caps for new jacks, I produce raps
A snake swallowing himself from the tail
Niggas fail tryna spit rhymes of this scale
Suivez-moi, come vibe with your boy
With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
I'm so nice I amaze myself
I just listen to the playback and chase myself
A hundred generations later my rap style's still greater
Priceless, ask the appraiser
Snipe after the kill, after the thrill
I'm dog Tony Numskull how does it feel?
To beat a Jesus Christ Superstar from the cookoo farm
My oolong is too beaucoup for ya moms
Rip the Jack spit liquid crack
Light a spliff with a match till my lips is black
I knelt down emotional meltdown
I'm hellbound, I look around when the bell sound
You ready, then stand steady, ya hands feel heavy
Here come the enemy, fuck how many
You ready, rebound, think out loud
One Blood, Canibus, y'all niggas bow down
