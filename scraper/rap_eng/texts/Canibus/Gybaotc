[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn
Done been through Queens where the crooks hang
Done been on tour doing group thangs
Cause I'm always tasting that pootang
Really love it when a girl got a cute name
Got a cute attitude and a cute frame
Got a big ass butt, breasts and no brain
Them things make a nigga want to shoot game
Now check it, I done been through a few thangs
Done seen a lot more than some loose change
Always been open minded to new thangs
Looking for a rap nigga, I'ma true thang
Been a Hip-Hop nigga since youth man
Beat-box and break-dance too man
Used to do electric boogaloos man
Do Egyptian love with two hands
I remember when I lived down south, yo
In a hot ass one story house, yo
Where the A.C. was always going out, yo
Sometime spend a whole day outdoors
We had a block-party, barbeque, eating food, in the pool
Music got us in that mood, everybody act a fool
I'mma tell you like this man
Every night I go down to the city man
To the gentlemen's club where my niggas hang
Them stripper chicks know how to strip man
DJs be spinning them hits man
Play the Cash-Money clique and the Jigga man
Them hoes be thick but sick man
Every stripper think a motherfucking rich man
Like Sisqo, the R&B singing man
Think I got a bank account with a million man
Case of Crystal cost about six grand
Bitch better get a less expensive brand
Got to stick to the budget when I trick, man
How about ten dollars for a sip, man?
My whole dance for a ten dollar tip, man
Still waiting on my royalty check, man
How about a rain-check next time, yo?
How about a handful of coupons, yo?
How about tickets to my next five shows
Turn around, let me test that behind, yo, I love a fine ho

[Chorus x2]
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club

[Verse 2: Free]
Nigga please! What you think this is
We ain’t just strippers, we actresses
I been tryin' to get into this acting bizz
But in the meantime I need cash to live
Shake this big butt, pay them dues
I gotta buy books cause I’m goin to school
Mama ain’t raised no female fool
I gotta use what God gave a bitch to use
Big titties ain’t nuttin but tools
With a fat ass I control the room
Plus I probably make more money than you
And I got a man, look at my tattoo
Most niggas wanna know where I’m from
My hair short now, but it used to be long
If you really wanna see a girl perform
You gotta give me more than ten dollars a song
$50 make me come out the thong
Grab you in your neck, just legs and arms (?)
Niggas hear a song, gettin hot and warm
Better not touch me, I call the guards
A lot of y'all niggas tryna go too far
I don’t get down like that, uh-uhh
If you thought so, nigga, you thought wrong
Most of y'all fellas got wives at home
You can trick her, but you can’t trick me
See you in the stripclub every week
Tryna keep it low key and be discrete
You got a mark where your wedding ring ‘posed to be
I don’t give a damn, keep hitting me offf
Fifty dollars a song, that’s what it cost
Nigga I don’t care that you got a divorce
Glad the bitch left, nigga, it’s your fault
Everytime you see me you’re tryna talk
Tryna stall the time because you ass is broke
That’s right, you can’t pay child support
Don’t offer me no cigarette, I don’t smoke
All the girls know who you with
And you got more kids than an orphanage
What it is, you mean what it was
Nigga, get your broke ass out the club

[Chorus x2]
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Girl, why you trying to get loud, screaming lies
Acting surprised, rolling your eyes
You act like a nigga done committed a crime
You know my elbow just brushed your thigh
Now them guys, twice my size
Tryna throw a nigga like me outside
I be up in this club all the time
But it's the first time that I crossed the line
Damn girl, why you so mean to me?
You know I can't leave, I done lost my keys
Don't throw me out, Mr. Bouncer, please
Let me take the girl up to V.I.P
She was just playing cause I'm low on cheese
Look at it, she only got eyes on me
They bloodshot red, so she's smoking weed
You know how these stripper chicks love to tease
I think I left my cell phone back at my seat
I had a couple of drinks and I need a receipt
Follow me to the bathroom to pee
I keep about three G's in my briefs
Damn baby boy, you done ripped my sleeve
I ain't trying to beef, give me room to breath

[Chorus x2]
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the clubth
Why I got to leave, tell me what I done?

[Outro: Canibus]
God damn girl, give a nigga some love
I'm all out of dubs but I'll give you some ones
