[Intro: Canibus]
Rock!
Rock! Rock! Rock!

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Jump up and down if you love the sound
We Rip and Rock until we tear shit down
Rip Rock stands for Hip Hop mixed with Rock 'N' Roll
I'm hardcore to my inner soul
Hold on as I swerve outta control
Directly into the unknowns of a black hole
All my real niggas with fucked up neurotransmitters
Waving Glocks and swastikas
I'ma take twenty shots of this hard liquor
And swigga till I'm drunk as the Pississippi River
Even though I know the shit is fucking up my liver
Tomorrow when I wake up, I won't even remember
How I got home or where I got this tattoo of a mic on my arm from
Or when I fucked them bitches last night, I should of used a condom
(I guess not) Now that's what I call Rip Rock!

[Chorus 1 (x2): Canibus]
Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock
Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock
Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock
Rip (c'mon) .. Rock! (yeah)

[Chorus 2 (x2): Canibus]
You want Rock 'N' Roll? (We got it)
You want Hip Hop? (We got it)
You wanna wreck shop? (We got it)
We got it got it
We got it got it got it

{*guitar interlude - like a heavy metal snake charmer's song*}

[Canibus]
C'mon! {*echoes*}
Rock!
Rock! Rock! Rock!

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I want you to sucker-punch whoever you standing next to
If you ready to rock with a ReFugee rebel
A Navy Seal underwater in a submarine vessel
Shitting on niggas above sea level
I'm tired of you MCs talking about loot
I'm tired of you corny drug-induced Rap groups
I'm tired of the lies, the cries, the screams
Tired of getting my name misspelled in magazines
I'm tired of you two-faced disc jockeys
Non-believers, sucking on my arch enemy's penis
You know who you are, I'm talking to you
You need to recognize I'm tryna introduce something new
Something I would sacrifice my life and die for
Something if I was already dead I would rise for
Something that would make a fool a hundred times wiser
Something that will help all mankind to prosper
I die with laughter, looking at you wack MCs
With your craft unmastered, bastards
Hip Hop in it's rarest form
Crossbreeded with Rock 'N' Roll, now Rip Rock is born
Motherfuckers!

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! {*echoes*} (Yeah!)
C'mon! Rip Rooooooooooooooooooock!
