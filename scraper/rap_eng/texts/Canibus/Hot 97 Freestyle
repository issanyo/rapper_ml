I cut through your epidermal layers with verbal lasers
Sharp as the razors on the feet of olympic ice skaters
Carvin' figure eights in the pavement
Judges'll smile with amazement till their facial muscles start achin'
The most dedicated Hip-Hop lyrical patron
Bustin' on Hot97's frequency modulation
Make sure your Monday Night Mixtapes is tapin'
Cluemanatti controls the airwaves like Freemasons
Thought I couldn't freestyle? You must be freebasin'
After this album tell Universal I'm a free agent
I might move to Japan and marry me a Asian
Or move back to Jamaica and start DJin'
Predaminam one, predaminam two, predaminam three
Or I might stay in New York and murder emcees
I intertwine with rhymes like:
Two girls livin' together, havin' their menstrual cycles at the same time like
I kick a rhyme that'll melt the earth
Then ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse
Sippin' on sizzurp, tryna stay alert, belch and burp
I know I'm the illest, I don't know if it helps or hurts
Nobody could copy me, I got a doctor's degree in Botany
That's why I can grow my Marijuana properly
Listen to my voice New York, listen deeply
You are getting sleepy...
On July 18th you're gonna get up, go to the record store
And you're gonna buy 2000 B.C
Listen to my voice, please, listen deeply
You are getting sleepy...
On July 18th you're gonna get up, go to the record store
And you're gonna buy 2000 B.C
I breathe in real deep, through the nostrils
Charge my lungs like a CO2 cartridge
Soon as the air is released the rhyme launches
Hit you like a Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9 comet, what!?
Canibus'll bus' yo ass
Strike a match against your mustache, light my spliff and laugh
Take two tokes and pass
Wait till my lyrics reach critical mass, then whip the G.O.A.T.'s ass
I speak with the silent syntax of insects
Human ears are inequiped to hear my E.L.F
Extremely low frequencies that frequently flow
Type my rhymes out in morse code with pinky toes
Bury your body underneath stones where algae grows
Underneath oak trees guarded by thirteen flows
Can-I-Bus'll bus' a flow, bust my load
Bust all over your radio, I'll bust down your throat
I'll bust like Busta-Bus be bustin' for Flipmode
And keep bustin' till you can't see cuz of the gunsmoke
Like inactive volcanoes, mad cuz they ain't blow
Searchin' for that pot of gold under the rainbow
Or searchin for that big pot of platinum
Down at the bottom of the North Atlantic with the Titanic captain
I been rappin' since rap happened
My passion goes way beyond drinkin' Don P out of crystal glasses
Yo, yo, check it, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
So every gig is Sunday, Monday, through Friday
We could battle in 5 o'clock traffic on West Side highway
If they could see it live, why pay?
I'll slay you in broad day, so stop bein' cocky and try me
I'll be downstairs in Hot97's lobby in about five minutes if you think you can out rhyme me
To the Ghetto Supastar that plays the guitar
And got lucky off Salaam Remi's track Fu-Gee-La
Trust me nigga, every dog has his day
I'll chop off ya dreads and auction 'em on ebay
So yo, forget the he say-she say
Rumors are cliche, I'm just here to talk about my release date
July 18th, I got to be honest
12 o'clock in the morning you should be standing in line for it
2000 B.C. coming out tomorrow
My album is ill, you could ask Clue or Duro
Ask anybody you see in the five boroughs
Even niggas that bootleg said my shit is thorough
Listen: It's not like I'm wack, it's not like I can't rap
It's not like I'm not black, so cop that
Believe that, you just witnessed the sickest emcee rap
100 bars no feedback, peace black
