Listen to me everybody, I got a story to tell
Well, well

Ono wan make beef outta steam fish?
Tell ya artist keep my name out they mouth or you won't have no peace
Compared to Canibus, you pitbulls is poultry
You and Biggie made a dope team but I roast Beans
Be careful how you approach things
My name ain't J to the Muahh, man, I got a flow that stings
It's rap music, you confuse it if you want to
I might still diss you just to see what you gon' do
You must be gettin' insecure or something
I'm just admirin' your shit, man, I ain't gon' touch it
I been through a lot of things in my life but I learned from it
Put yourself in my shoes, don't I deserve something?
The only difference between me and you is a budget
Don't make me have to go and sign with Suge or something
Remember this: history repeats itself
Whenever that never-ending hunger meets itself
Everybody want they wealth, peace and health
When I was fucked up you ain't give me a couple of G's to help, did you?
No, you waited for my cheese to melt
You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself
Well my patronymic is different enough to attract interest
From anybody in the rap business and I'mma get it, cash or credit
Besides a little drama with my first 2 records
Rip the Jacker's image is unblemished
Come on, I wouldn't bite you I look at you like my dentist
I thought you was number one recommended, why you offended?
Hip hop ain't your property, you ain't the only tenant
If I win the lottery, you can't tell me how to spend it
You got something to say, don't put your Henchmen in it
Them little monkey-faced artist that you sign for pennies
I refuse to serve them like Denny's
You know they rhymes is petty
Don't tell me that your school of hard knocks turn preppy
None of y'all motherfuckers know me and you never met me
And if my name wasn't shit, then, you wouldn't sweat me
That's absurd right? Me gettin' busy get on your nerves, right?
You really are listenin' to the words, right?
High when I wrote this but sober when I spoke it
It's not like I tried to promote it like Jay-O did, you notice?
Man, I was never focused on you
I just spit hard on the mic 'cause my shit is hot too
I went out and bought your album 2 times, I ain't hatin'
Next thing I know, you talkin' Jamaican, like, you a native
But you really violatin', you don't know what you sayin'
Canibus ain't in the game, so you know he ain't playin
I had nothing before and I have nothing now
Fuckin' with a nigga with nothing only brings you down
