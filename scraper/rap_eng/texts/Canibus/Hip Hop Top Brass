(Verse 1: Canibus)

Kool G Rap and Grandmaster Cash
To me you’re hip hop’s top brass
You encouraged me to take it to task
Raekwon and Tony Starks
Both showed me how to throw darts
Hanglide and hold on strong to Bogart
INX you guard
Golden Arms taught me how to boot
I turned it into infinite computer bars
The great Killah Priest last but not least
You a part of me
Respect to every Killa Bee
Just to be associated with Supreme is a honor
Wouldn’t have met none of ya’ll
If it wasn't for Tanya
I'm the Jackenthreat monster
Chang Sung tongue kiss Cassandra
Your mama call me Cappadonna Obama
Copperhead cobra's got no winds of mi casa
Trans humanism Lady Gaga trachea chopper
Translate to babble White Castle
Black Stets and Checkerboard tassles
Cowboys comin' at you to battle
Nah nigga stop playin'
2:00 in the morning a.m
I got respect for hip hop’s made men
The Logic of Misanthropic
DC from CC the Prophet
Shan51 from C0mpl3x
Zack from Virginia
First Brigade Porter Rock my nigga
All the fallen and all the injured
Rutledge cheffin' up the best beefsteak
[ ]  I know a lot of soldiers shoot each others
Mortar shell romance and a buffalo stance
Turn the [ ]
("RTJCollection.com")
Turn the 10,000 bars for a vocal with 10,000 dinars
I got 10,000 lyrical laws

(Canibus raps in Jamaican patois)
We take you out upon de stair
Ya have too much money where I'vea put it
You on some [  ] pussy
Shoe shine drop from a UZI
I'm a nine I and I lick off ya face two times
(End of Jamaican patois)

Drink fine wine
Greedy when it when it comes to my grind time
With iodine eyes and nine lives
Twist knives to intestines
Divide chest from spine
The more you cry the more I’m satisfied
With my battle rhymes

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Canibus)

But when a lifeform designed for
A longer lifespan than yours
Got fans at home and fans abroad
Beware the Ides of March
The Ripper spit 10,000 bars
["RTJcollection.com"]
My heart sadness
Macho guillotine gestapo
Zero tolerance nigga
You don’t know what I know
A freak of nature with a piece of paper
I ad lib "Thank you Jesus" when the preacher
Praise a name an emcee would save him
Persuade him be patient
Refuse the temptations of Satan
Earthquake him like the beast that was Haitian
Maybe reverberations Reverb Nation
Pagan radio station contagion
Rip the Jacker is perfect for replacement for
The current hip hop administration's
Complete total lack of appreciation
For artists that was always creative
I’m sayin I’m holdin on to the previous cycle
Still lookin for my idol
Still grievin' for Michael
I was betrayed by King James
So I wrote my own Bible
10,000 bar recital indebt to my own title
Droppin knowledge bombs inspired by Armorall
Get God on the conference call
That’s how I'ma prove it to ya’ll
Yeah I rap about the moon and the stars
The lunar surface of Mars
Search the universe for beautiful bars
Brought it through customs filled out the forms
They tore my computer apart
Sabotaged the music you want
But I refuse to lose even though they think that I lost
Infinite bars mean more to hip hop than complete songs
That’s what Eminem called his first album, remember?
Well I just made 10 of them without lifting a finger
And I ain’t dissin' him nigga
I just sayin that cuz it's the truth
This IS infinity, this is the proof
I ain't bitter, I’m better
Rip the Jacker spit lyrics forever
I'm still enjoying rap's primitive pleasures
Status report, battle for sport
Throw his ass in Virtual Reality Court
Time up after he lost through magic of course
How about it? What’s happenin' boss?
We battle for our souls tell me what's that gonna cost?
I ain’t losin' that battle you crazy?
Matter of fact after a battle with you
They ain’t even gotta pay me

(Canibus raps acapella)

Get it in gear
I spit it loud and clear in the middle of your ear
In other words I'm in the middle of your hemisphere
Left right Germaine wanna wreck the mic
Whatever the price
I’m ready to fight tonight
Audibly metaphorically
I'ma sit sonically in the body of rap
Fuckin' with Bis you heard?
Yeah you heard
Verbally abuse you with words
Curse and serve with racial slurs
Step up to the base
Curveball I'll crush your face
I'll probably say Infinity too much to take
You don’t wanna trade flows with the RTJ
Zucka Zucka DJ for the race

(Hook)

[Voice: "Once the ripper had gotten to a quiet place
It would have been quite an easy matter for him to"]
[Voice: Rip the Jacker]

(Verse 3: Canibus)

This soul is mine, fryin' frozen in time
The most obscure science of all time
Metaphorically expressin' illegal possession
Teach you a lesson
Beat you into submission
Drag you into oppression
Unpleasurable for any rapper
Total immeasurable madness
Followed by rehab and sadness
The Horseman sharpshooters
Rip the Jacker, the master of infinity is too swift to capture
Grind Time want me to get it on with Dizaster
But he never on my level, I eat him for practice
Gang starved guru flow
They exiled me many moons ago
Hip hop is fucked up I know
My Jamaican  cousin Duck the Buckman
He ain't a fucking pussy don't push him
Rip the fuckin Jacker I whooped 'im
Coup d'etat samurai slaughter both sides
We only achieve peace when every warrior dies
Why? A war is a war
Bloodshed pours from the poor
Rich bitches don't walk through that door
They [ ] high tech lynchins'
Of me and my kinsmen
You think we ain't been blackballed from hip hop you trippin'
"You delusional! Prove it!"
So who am I to prove it to?
Am I supposed to prove it  to a fool in a suit?
To blackface conservative groups with Ku Klux roots?
Reporters lookin' for a scoop that don't support our troops?
I'm just a boy cryin' wolf
Next to a baboon with gangrene tooth
Knock brains loose when man meets moose
With my battle rhymes
