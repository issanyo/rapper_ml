[Verse One]
Ha ha ha ha ha
Check out the bizarre style that I display god
Ha ha ha ha ha
Kinda like when the biz went
Eh eh eh eh eh
But this is the Canibus with the
Ha ha ha ha ha
Now
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ain't just the name of the song
Ha ha ha ha ha
It's probably my favorite response
When I'm walking on the street or I'm out at the mall
And people be talking that blah blah blah
Ha ha ha ha ha
But anyway, a regular day is just like this
Canibus writes a rhyme then Canibus spits, Like
Ha ha ha ha ha
I eat eat eat rhymes, Niggas don't be understanding that shit
Why you think I went and put a fucking mic on my arm
Cause it belongs to me and I belong next to Ghengis Khan
In a coffin carbon-dryed with my body in bronze
Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm great but I'm not the greatest
Ha ha ha ha ha
I believe I'm God but I'm not atheist
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm crazy but I'm not the craziest
I'm just a normal heterosexual Homo Sapien
Ha ha ha ha ha
The industry tried to cave me and I was an archangel
But they changed me into Damien
Ha ha ha ha ha
The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper
Ha ha ha ha ha
Rip the Jacker
Master of the ceremony, most people know me as such
My disciples know me as master 'Bus
I can
Ha ha ha ha ha
Change their life with a touch, cause I'm
Ha ha ha ha ha
Lyrically gifted as fuck
Can-I-Bus, could bust it down pound for pound
My style'll make a thousand MC's bow
Ha ha ha ha ha
You can yah yah yah cha cha cha cha cha all you want
Y'all niggas know the Canibus is the one
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
The rhyme creator
At the drop of a dime I spit 100 b-a-rs
I'm a S-T-A-R since the day I was born
And I'll be a star til the day that I'm gone
Ha ha ha ha ha
You can agree with uh-huh or disagree with uh-uh
Whatever, niggas can't front
Ha ha ha ha ha
If they respond too late to the 911 call
They find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm
Deep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long
Paramedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone
You was pronounced D.O.A. before you got to E.R
The doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause
Probably because, you weak insecure motherfuckers
Feel lost when you hear me roar
Ha ha ha ha ha
Like-uh the predator starring Schwartzenegger
Before he triggered the bomb he went
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper
Ha ha ha ha ha
Rip the Jacker

[Verse Two]
Its legibly unimaginable, mathematically incalculable
Inextricably infallible
Let's not forget utterly impossible or
Morally insurmountable to assume that I could lose if I battled you
My Scholastic Aptitude is 1602
100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
I've constructed sentences
That'll stand longer than Stonehenge's megaliths
My 1st and 2nd albums consist of more then a million terabits
More than any of you rappers ever spit
Vote for me as President, in about a day or so
I be up in the White House getting fellatio
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Butt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke
Or on a speaker phone freestyling with some of my folks
Humping a ho tampering with the Republican vote
I'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman
Dodging arrows from the arches cause I'm a Horseman
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress
Maximize my wins, minimize my losses
'Til I'm exhausted then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus
I'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the Prince and the Duke of Earl
I'm probably the illest English speaking MC in the world
Ghetto fabulous, verbally hazardous
Ask any Baptist, Roman Catholic or satanic activist
Even them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus
I've got rhymes like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
Show me where he is, I sign the ordinance
To bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him
Burn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him til its 12 in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Rip his heart out, eat it while its still pumping
The blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings
Starving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College
Cause I heard they didn't serve porridge
Smarter than any man in Scotland Yard is
Used to work for MI-6 but quit cause I couldn't take orders
I was the original James Bond before Sean Conn', Roger Moore
Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan
The most awesome walking, talking, breathing
English speaking MC in the European region
Rip you to pieces like Communism leaflets
Beef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces
Modern Christians without Jesus, Rastas without reefer
Jamaicans in Princeton without visas
Radios without speakers, Mother Nature without the four seasons
Without a jacket outside when its freezing
I'mma tell you straight up, no lie
Canibus is the illest motherfucker alive
Ha ha ha ha ha
The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper
Rip the Jacker
