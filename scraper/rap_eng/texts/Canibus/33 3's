Intro, [imitating the owl from the "Tootsie Pop" commercials]
One ... two ... three...
(Chomping sound) ... three!!

[Canibus]
Yo, in linear terms, my 33 degree and a 3rd
Words will give you 30 3rd degree burns
First I write 33 lines to a verse
About how I created the Earth out of 33 quirks
33 of my peers never thought it would work
For 33 days, I started my relentless research
And I figured, if Jigga could do, 22 2's
As an MC, then I could do 33 3's
Suddenly it occurred at 3:30 on March 3rd
It came to me like God's word
I started to load my .33 Caliber Mossberg
Went to the top of the Empire State on 33rd
33 gunshots was heard
33 pedestrians lay wounded or dead on the curb
33 squad cars rushed to the scene
As soon as they heard some madman had gone berserk
I demanded 33 million
Or I was going to kill 33 of the women and children in the building
I gave them 33 minutes to respond
Then I proceeded to arm a backpack nuclear bomb
I set the timer for 3 hours and 3 minutes long
Told them not to try nothing funny or I'd kill them all
They still never responded
Until I saw 33 of the S.W.A.T. team jump out of 3 helicopters
I told them for the 3rd and final time
If they crossed the line again, I'd take 33 lives
3 of the hostages started crying, 3 of them started wilding
And convinced 3 more to start an uprising
3 of them stood to their feet and started freestyling
I didn't know what to do, so I started rhyming
I tried to kick 300 bars
But I got picked off by a sniper from 33 yards
The bullet hit me but it got lodged and ricocheted off
3 organs 3 inches away from my heart
My name went down in history as the illest MC
Rewind it and count it, 33 3's
