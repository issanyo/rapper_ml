(Canibus)
Emcees with thin throats get lynched with thick ropes
Nod till they necks broke, and they cassette decks smoke
I'm probably the most murderous, merciless
Version of a modern day Copernicus
The world has ever heard of yet
Cold blooded and rugged, shove a gun turret to your stomach
And start busting till you shitting buckets of dry ice nuggets
Cold freestyling, cold rhyming
Cold enough to freeze the mucus lining, in your sinus, rock solid
Spitting, straight running through the competition
Quicker than calculators take to run through long division
Sprinting, from the beginning, from the start to the finish
Quicker than, the cameras niggas use to see a split decision
Arms swinging, a four fifth slinging, ammunition
Pop your clip in, Cap One and Canibus is, listen
