[Bridge: Canibus]
Do or do not do, there is no try
Looking at the Phoenix Rise

[Hook: Canibus]
Life is about learning to live with what you can't control
The soul plays a substantial role

[Break: Canibus]
Krav Maga, bad ass Rasta, arm wrestling monsters
Motherfucker nearly crashed the chopper

[Bridge: Canibus]
Do or do not do, there is no try
Looking at the Phoenix Rise

[Break: Canibus]
Formula 1 champagne son, stage one
Stage two, stage three,  stage four ya done
1 million titties, 500 thousand girls
Georgia guide stones diamonds and pearls

[Verse 1: Canibus]
We eat Wyghu beef, the Phoenix sunrise in the east
The language is scientific but street
The mountain man was told to go pound sand, there's fresh water in them lands, sittin' on his horse folding his hands
Who am I don't ask, I'ma ask you if you old enough to dance
Cause right now you holdin' up the plans
I sleep for a thousand years, woke up with a beard
Looking at my light aura in the mirror
Life is about learning to live with what you can't control
The soul plays a substantial role
A fighter jet barrel rolls over a narrow road
Goin so fast my head was shaped tadpole
I'm in Booger Hollow Alabama
Told the bitch to make me a sandwich
Got that peanut butter jelly goin ham with the hammers
And ham radio scanners smoking turtle with Santa
The Space Warden race around orbit for their blatant enjoyment
Try to find a better place of employment
Eyes cast below looking for the Phoenix sun rise
Pray and fast cause spirits are among the skies

[Hook x2: Canibus]

[Verse 2: Canibus]
User generated generation XYZ station
They parked their spaceship right on the pavement
Formula 1 champagne son, automatic pneumatic lung
My big dun Domingo on the drums
Contained in the corridor between Pennsylvania and Baltimore Miss Moneypenny hold all calls
Canibus Planet composed of Pelodian Granite
My handset batteries dead - I'm stranded
Spiritually awakened, banished within corporeal spaces
In ultra magnetic places off world bases
The black cube, the Kaaba, Esharra the Goddess
I showed her my potential for knowledge she made me a promise to give me Non Local Photon Vocals, with Higgs Boson Portals
To grow my very own Robot Cultures
A lie is short lived but so is the long truth
Who do you sing  songs to? Who do you belong to?
I belong to the One that created me
The One that has never forsaken me
The One who watch patiently
While I made the worst mistake then reincarnated me
Stand tall - no fear on the gateway to nowhere
No emotion so the poetry's clear
My Robot more advanced than any Rock Band...
Believe it! Above Pop Secret
A thousand fallen demons gotta blog talk podcast grievance
Frankenstein Aryan eyes
Hazel, black or brown eyes all looking at the purple sunrise
Aurora Borealis outside my Alaskan Palace
As long as the rap contract valid
If I can do something then I'ma do it got dammit
If you can't do nothing you need to improve God damn it!!
Formula 1 nitro pipes, Michael Jai White on fright night
My flow like indigo dash lights
Cut chop and slash like price of trash
The first shall be first after the next to the last
Slow down you speeding - hand brake - park your mouth
Open the door count to 1 point 4 and get out
For me, open canopy, the brass walk over to examine me
All this G force got me aggi
Temporal aerodynamic pan ceramic X-Man Gambit
I star spangled it then man handled it
My ears is buzzin, they talking crazy out there cousin
Don't ever assume they talkin' bout nothing
Who you representin' got killed by a media weapon
Let the Teleprompter tell him read me the reference
Were you there in his presence? OK for now we gotta'
Hold all questions, you see that tall girl talk to her breastess
