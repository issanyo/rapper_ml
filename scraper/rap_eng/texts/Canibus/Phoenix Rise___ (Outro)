[Chorus]
(But I couldn’t get around it)
I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Black Star, black light; just another day in the life
Paying the price, still trying to live righteous, right?
Up before sunrise, open my eyes
Take a walk with my spirit guide, go outside
They think I lost my mind, but I’m just looking at the hands of time
Until it’s time to cross that divide
Already fulfilled my purpose, I spit these verses
This whole material world is all worthless
Experience deep in the flesh
My memory has a shelf life from my first to my last breath
That’s why I laugh at death; every week cash the check
Go home with some gas and a spliff
Canibus! See I knew Bis
Couldn’t get around it; the truth is, I had to go through it
This is the price I pay to make music
This is what music like this produces

[Chorus]
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I am the creator of the extreme; I dream
I wear clothes cut by black, gold, and green laser beams
The deep lilac lion of purified iron
Crafted a trident and offered it up to Poseidon
In earnest they may form an alliance
Before the very last drop of water on planet Earth is expired
But it was too late; the rulers of the empire rain down fire
The sound of annihilation is quiet
Nothing desired, nothing admired
Just a pile of rubble that emits silence; greed at its finest
I walk towards nowhere; something appears
I walk closer then I realize, nothing is there
I smell ammonia distilled from bones and dung
Odor at the border, the golden tongue
The fragrance made me feel weightless
Took me to a faraway place that felt familiar but ancient
It feels ancient because, this all happened before
Lord Shiva, the Destroyer of Worlds
I woke from the dream and for whatever it’s worth
I said a prayer to the Most High; it could’ve been worse
He performed great works, recreated the earth
Shewbread dipped in olive oil, you taste first

[Chorus x2]
(But I couldn’t get around it)
I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)

[Verse 3: Canibus]
The windmill of wealth doesn’t spin by itself
No matter who you are, you need help
Hate is inspired by survival
That’s why some people never get along
Even when then try to
Everything happens in cycles
You was king for a century, then you was beaten by your rival
I asked life, “How do I describe you?”
Sits down beside you, looks you in the eye spiteful
If karma goes around for real
Then it must be taking the scenic route, on foot, no wheels
Think you hot cuz you got deal?
Nothing lasts forever, now kneel
That’s what I thought; how it feel?
That’s all I’m trying to reveal
I ain’t trying to see your dreams get killed
And watch you fiend for a mill
The Devil in a red suit, sittin’ on the stoop
Eatin’ goat head soup; some type of throwback loop
The blowback blew you off of the roof
And caused other problems too
I speak to it, then it talk to you
I find a trophy underneath all the dust and grime
At least one more time, I can bust a rhyme
Then forever the rapper organize metadata; success is a ladder
The higher you go, the more the risk it collapses
Energy returned on energy invested
Other than that, doesn’t matter who the best is

[Chorus]
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes
(But I couldn’t get around it)
The Most High knows I tried
