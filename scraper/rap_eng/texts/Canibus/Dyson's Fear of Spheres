[Canibus]
Step into the grand SCIF room
Please carefully describe what you see besides a crescent-lit moon
The Frescoes of Pompeii depict modern day
Polyentendres peak like Dante
Speaking of minister Mugabe's calendar in Zimbabwe
The Earth's first ancient underground enclave
Where the priesthood pontiffs burn white smoke to keep conscious
Convene in the square with the black mambas
And the Tibetan mandalas, the plaque of Palanka
Who is your sponsor? Ganja
Mahatma Gandhi in concert before the whole world
Was conquered by the antichrist, I watched it
These problematic mystic nescient narcissistic
Dimwits still obsessed with the way that I spit shit
You sitting on the highway stuck
I get around traffic in a high rail truck with a flywheel clutch
The rap music watch dog, Hip hop robot borg
I got JP Beats on the boards
We Rap music watch dogs, Hip Hop robot borgs
JP headphones got cobalt chords
Special agent Alexander has bad manners
He gerrymanders cancer communities, speaking bad Spanish
And since it's now legal, the task force going wild weasel
They confiscate drugs from the people
Evolved from clips and chrome to bone age cone head clones
With nano ohms operated headphones
Back in the day I used to order chicken parmigiana
At the Mondrian and have a sunset seance
She put a nice négligée on
A soft mink bed spread, we could both lay on and just talk
She flirting, combing through her hair with her own fingers
I wouldn't expect her to know those lyrics
She can't wait to get the album, it downloaded 500 thousand
She says I'm the King of Crap Mountain
For me to sell out, that means somebody gotta buy in
Nobody bit the bait Bis, try again
Confirm life is real, the wound too deep to heal
A man like that does not want to feel
They say I'm too old to rap, six minute mile laps
I'll stop when I'm too old to do that
I work for three shifts of eight then I'm out the gate
I post haste forthwith before I walk away
I been the worlds leading rap manufacturer for quite some while
Don't even trip when they bite my style
I want the whole world to upgrade, humankind struggle to this day
Many survived the double digit age
But the mortality rate everywhere is not the same
Promote life after life like St. Germaine
Rhymes, reasons, signs, times and seasons
The latest in line with unprecedented achievements
We all know what these was, bees where the bees get buzzed
My super bug is immune to the drums
Watch him howl at the Moon, the son of a bitch, half baboon
He got a wrap around serpent tattoo
He sent floods and radiation to poison our blood
He deceived the whole world to destroy our love
He has no color, he doesn't see the other as his brother
Even though he knows we need each other
He's a animal that walks upright with a fucked up love life
He can't even get a hug for the night
If you see me with my teeth fixed, that means I'm rich
If your teeth is fucked up it's cause you sucked my dick
Talk to the Comms chief, he asked, "What's the status?"
We got to survey the fire lit caverns on Saturn
When we landed in a damaged flight cabin
I got out and saw a hexagonal pattern, walked over and grabbed it
The co-pilot was dead holding a picture of his kids
It would be insensitive to say he wasn't meant to live
I walked forty clicks the from the edge of the A Ring
Crossed over the Encke divison, Molybdenum bridge
The creature I saw, a cross between a pig with the face of a squid
And fine hairs like an Arachnid
It said, "If you gonna stand there and stare
You might as well walk over here and yank my beard if you ain't scared"
I've seen enough I gotta get back to where to I live
From that place of abundance called the Dyson sphere
I moved to the U.S. when I was two years old
I've paid taxes here so long, this is where I call home
The spectre metrics edit is exceptionally impressive
Syndromic tornado Tourette's but what's that?
Show mercy upon my soul through proper governance and goodwill
I am your obedient servant still
We are consumed by war, slave class martial law
Blood red like the plateau on Mars
I will live, love, learn and try not to burn
For one day soon the golden one shall return
If we discern and work hard to earn, get what we deserve
The golden ones return, it's our turn
Freedom of press means you getting too nosey
Get sentenced to death 'cause those were some senseless steps
Let the rooster take care of his biz, let the hens lay eggs
Let the hard working people make bread
'Cause we don't want much, we just want what we want
You act like we had a choice, like you didn't set us up
If you can't stand the sound of your family's moans
Then you need to get over there and bandage those bones
Squeaky wheels get oiled, silent frogs sit there and boil
All refrigerated items might spoil
Any knowledge is not good knowledge
Unless you gain enough knowledge to emerge from the darkness where it all started
Till the light sparketh, manifest itself and departed
Never to return but yet still a part of it
Do you comprehend that? Say that last part again
"I was busy watching football again"
The power cut off again, on again, off again
It's the end of the world but let's all pretend
It was just an awful dream, can't even express what I mean
'Cause I don't even know what I seen
