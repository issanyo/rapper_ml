(Intro)
You see that strange fire
That light above the side

(Canibus)

Formaldehyde less than ten thousand feet high
Round men with red eyes beam down from blue skies
Half human half griffon what a beautiful cristen
You got winds you can fly you got ears you could listen
Use your eyes as a tool for precision their life liquid is crimson
They rule this prison plant from beginning
Some have green blood but I don't care I still fuck with em
The poet laureate blue bloods get blue ribbons
I woke up out my sleep to the sound of rude alien children
The sun was sizzling the moon was missing
I witnessed the first bar war laws some new lyrics
What is it neo-tech killers seduce the apprentice
Them son of bitches mutilated cows all we could do is say "wow"
How you feel about mutilating humans now
They shoot down drones with down range caliber chromes
In wedge formation traveling home

(Hook)

Ancestry
All G's are related genetically
Rather meet again by the hands of destiny
The DNA genome
In an alien form
Wherever hip hop was born we're going back home

(Canibus)

Be in C code satellite transmitters lead into my cloth
Authorized by Formaldehyde flows
Guidance system provide the wisdom star map wizards
Improvising positions tryin to soften collisions
I was lost out at desert donkeys dragged off with the records
The SOS message sucked like a pair of breasts
All female fleet tight fit space suits with no crease
Nice breast glutes and feet
They wear self lacing latex boots
They come to earth to play the flute
Juice tigers making automated juice
Their eyes blink vertically kaleidoscope geometry circles me
They hypnotize the plant for eternity
