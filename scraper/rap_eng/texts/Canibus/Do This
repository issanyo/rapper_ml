[Sample: The Alan Parsons Project - Somebody Out There]
And I don't need more confusion in my life
No more pain and disillusion in my life
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on
And never end

[Intro: Canibus]
DJ Vital and DJ Million
This is sir William
I might spit a billion

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I'm outside walking the dogs, on my way back
Two dark brown mitchmatched Rhodesian Ridgebacks
Majestic mic master maverick
This is Goose, don't crash it
Move or get mauled by a mastiff
Live, freestyling from the files, whatever
The gravity pull your body apart like mozzarella
I make you bark till your lungs warp, my tongue's sharp
Cut ya thumbs off, cut you down while you run off
Heavy swing snow ploughs, artillery is danger close now
You just flow loud with no know how
Wow! did I just say [?]not sukow[?]
You understand what the fuck I'm saying now?
The last man to stand and talk to you through a bloody moustache
Javelin Fangz, you don't know the half
Sourdough biscuits and warmed up beans
In my stronghold steed jeans busting 16s
Mouth covered, every sound uttered come out muttered
Loud buzzers indicate that you ARE outnumbered
Got caught in the remedy of an untimely loss
I'm the boss, don't ever forget that hoss

[Scratching]
"Do this shit"
"All day"
"Got classics that haven't even touched the streets"
"Do this shit"
"We aim for the sky"
"I'm a motherfucking veteran, I'm telling you why"

[Verse 2: Bekay]
Bekay'll shatter your fam, if the battle's the plan
You 'bout to get ran over by a battering ram
And my whole army's swingin' swords
Slice your heart out, hand it back to you
Like, um, I think this is yours
When I spit, I get applause
When you spit bitch, is when a flow stop like menopause
I spit better for metaphors
If I ain't a star, then why my name all up in your mouth like it's dental floss?
Take my name up out of your mouth, pain is what i'm about
I'll get your dame up out of her blouse
I mean I came all over your spouse and house
It'll take two months to get the stains up out of your couch
So please get the fuck back
Cuz YOU couldn't hang with ME if you was my nutsack
Remain kinda humble, you can't try and rumble
When you about as gangsta as Bryant Gumbel
Ask Vital or Million, my raps be
So fly the Arabs be trying to hijack me
I'm breaking ya, cuz rappers is dollar happy
Look like a trachea, then tell you to holler at me

[Scratching]
"Do this shit"
"All day"
"Got classics that haven't even touched the streets"
"Do this shit"
"We aim for the sky"
"We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your fame"

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
You ain't the poison pen you the puzzled penguin
We don't take you serious like Jamie Foxx when he singing
Or Roy Jones when he still try to try to come out swinging
You John Bobbitt niggas have got the nerve to ask me how its hanging?
My shit is banging in your audio nerve
You nerds having the nerve to try to analyze my every word
Cuz I could swerve a bit to my left and I spit to my death
I swear on my neph, before I leave I slit my own neck
I ain't going a damn place
I'm the man with, the bandwidth, from the gram spit
To can't miss, my anguish, you threw me like hail fire
Who else you know turn down the dancers from Mariah
And Neil Levine's label, imperial distributed
The virgin, it wasn't a high six figures, if not for business
I ain't fucking with it, nigga bear witness
Independent and ballin' my movement's non risk
I'm the illest, I'm like Jesus to these young kids
DJ Vital is spinnin' while I murder this shit
Spitting for it, hit a different mami every day
Tom Cruise, getting married to prove you not gay

[Scratching]
"Do this shit"
"All day"
"Got classics that haven't even touched the streets"
"Do this shit"
"We aim for the sky"
"You wanna bomb me? You'll need a whole army"
"Army"
"You wanna bomb me? You'll need a whole army"
"Blaw"
"You wanna bomb me?"
"Blaw"
"You'll need a whole army"
"We aim for the sky"
"We'll knock out your spotlight"
"All day"
"Do this shit"
"All day every day"
"Got classics that haven't even touched the streets"
"Do this shit"
"We aim for the sky"
"Murder you and throw this rap shit out the window"
"Blaw"
