[Mike Tyson]

Hey Mike Tyson here speakin with the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but
Eat eat eat eat MC's, for lunch, breakfast
Hey man they been playin me all my life man
You know I won a title a couple a times did right
No but they can't hurt us man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle this li'l nigga

[Verse One - Canibus]

Yo I'mma let the world know the truth!
You don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laced your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched the footnotes, 'bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drug free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
]From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy!
You drippin with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga!

[Referee] - (Canibus in parentheses)
Hey hey hey hey, you just hold it right there
(Yo, get off me man)
We got an illegal low blow on the fighter in the blue trunks
(Yo, yo get the fuck off me man)
If I see one more of those, you're outta here brotha
(Yo get out my way man, yo he started this shit)
You understand? (Fuck you!)
You'll be disqualified (I'll bite that nigga again!)
Stop bein a bitch (Get the fuck off me man!)
We came to see a fight

[Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch ass niggas hangin out wit me man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out, or don't come out at all!

[Verse Two - Canibus]
Yo, you better give me the respect that I deserve or I'mma take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you summersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worse, rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
It's because of him now at least I know What Beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga trying to make a living off of dissing
Somebody that he's got to know is better than him
But he's feelin himself, cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you something, you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick em all
I'd even wait for the studio audience to applaud [cheers]

Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your 1st, 2nd and 3rd born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I'd saw naw he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand
From a lost and forgotten land, you done did it man
You done spitted some wack shittit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'd forget it?
Fuck that! Cause like Common and Cube I see The Bitch In You
And I'mma make the world see it too, motherfucker!

[Verse Three - Canibus]
I'll battle you on the net
I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect
I'll battle you for the respect
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
Cause battling's my favorite hobby that's probably why you despise me
We can battle in Hot 97's lobby
Constantly battling, out in the streets
Or Battle of The Beats, we can let Angie referee
Inside the jail y'all fenced prisoners look tense
Armed with shanks waiting for the battle commence
Ladies and gents
Pick up the phone and call in the side with the highest
?pennant and decide the wench?
Lowest versus the highest, I'll start a riot
You're a virus, you run around screaming "Stop The Violence!"
I rip mics tighter than pliers
You say you the greatest of all time?
You're a liar, your time's expired
You no longer have what Hip Hop requires, so retire!!!
