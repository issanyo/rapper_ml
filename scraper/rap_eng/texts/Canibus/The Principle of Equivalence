[Canibus]
River water floods every county with blood red algae
We are the people, the people have a bounty
Every man, woman and child, non-elites must bow
This is the future, the future is now
Freedom, liberty, the pursuit of happiness
The home of the brave with a ravenous dark side
Chickasaw war tribes, black apartheid
Hard on the eyes, heavy on the hearts and minds
We can't use constitution to defend our laws
Padelford v. Alderman, Savannah, Georgia
Executive Order 13037
They call us human capital, capital credit
Executive Order 12803
Everything in America's for sale my G
Fictitious obligation, how you gonna qualify that statement
When you still live in grandma basement?
Alone with your thoughts, don't wanna take your headphones off
They strip you to your draws in the airport
Zombies in the dead zone, pretty ass bitch she redbone
I sat next to her, no leg room
The Treaty of 1213 means I work for the Queen
I work to recover my title deeds
Do not folly with idle speech, poetry's deep
As silent as spiders feet
I.e. be quiet you creep, stealth submarine silent fleet
The man smiles, he admires the beast
A lamb is just something to eat
Especially when spicy seasoning is added to that tenderised meat
We are the people but the people don't count dude
Barron versus the mayor of Baltimore City Council
The USA was not founded on Christian values
The Treaty of Tripoli spells it out for you
Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the most powerful of all
10 paces draw in front of town hall
The estate was divided into districts to define it's existence
This is a realistic statistic
They set us up to perform poorly
It's the usual story, if you love me make a movie for me
The human population is so easily occupied
Human life is just a commodity modified
The highly comprehensive Canibus collection
Old school classic like them early century westerns
Papyrus paper record deals, stage coach wagon wheels
Been transporting my written cylinder seals
Medieval artefact retrieval
Yes we are the people but we're just poor people
Evolution produces revolution, not the other way around
These stupid ass rappers is as dumb as they sound
I want Freedom, I already know I'm a dead man speaking
Who dives before the RV every weekend
Multi-digit palindrome prime lexicon online
Linear lines up right on time
No more lies, crypto contrived quantum worlds collide
The moment the groom returns for his bride
I accept the slander and praise
Cause one of these days, it's gonna happen one of two ways
You wake, none of it's real, you laugh
All of the inertial mass of inert gas splits the world in half
All that is, is reincarnated to live
We only think we're alive but we're really dead
The yellow dragon from Hell
Hatched out of a black eggshell with a red tail and deep blue nails
The predator pulls energy from a pool of point 2 mega joules
At zero zero point residue
Ingest the yes pill, this is my last testament of will
Protected by a polar satellite shield, for real
I travel in the flesh but the goal is to travel without
The house of the Lord as a travelling house
In a G2 cloud with helium 3 hues unshrouded
Among spirits that the pyramid houses
Superwaves shear off the sides of every mountain
Spacecrafts land, a God steps down out of it
A little G God, no doubt about it, people crowd around him
Knowledge, looking gallant and valiant
Wisdom, knowledge is nothing without it
Understanding, every attribute itemized and counted
The wind blows up from the ground
The ground makes earthquake sounds, miles of city blocks shook down
The blood thirsty dracs shout, "Launch the attack!"
They say "stand like a man or crawl on your back"
Go ahead take a stand, I know you don't understand
See we always have a choice but we never had a chance
The murder weapon was thrown in the pacific in the high seas
That means it will never be retrieved
When individuals decide to climb into a hive mind
They shouldn't be surprised what they find
Your mind is no longer your own
A one billion man army of clones that follow orders like drones
Hopeless silence whispering quotes of violence
The sky is black, the smoke is violet
There is evil at the doorstep of every man
Declaring you have a choice, but you don't have a chance
The savage salivates at the scent of a man
And says you always had a choice but you never had a chance
What you gotta say about that Lieutenant Dan?
Bubba died right there in Forest Gump's hands!
