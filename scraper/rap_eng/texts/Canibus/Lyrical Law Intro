[Intro: Canibus]
Welcome to CanibusCatalogue.com
Thank you for your purchase
It's because of commited souls, just like you
All over the world, that this is even possible
While you're here, don't forget to pre-order
The "Lyrical Law" LP package
Which includes the "Lyrical Law" LP
And two bonus discs, with a personalized autograph from me
One of the bonus discs is gonna be a surprise
The other bonus disc is a collection, of my earliest recordings
From 1993, for an album I made, titled "Lyrical Warfare"
With a group called THEM
That's right, The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors
Also, I'd like to say thank you to the designers of this site
And the creator of the artwork for "Lyrical Law"
And the many supporters across the globe
That been ridin with the kid for more than 17 years
Thanks again; let's continue on with our journey
I know you gon' enjoy the album
