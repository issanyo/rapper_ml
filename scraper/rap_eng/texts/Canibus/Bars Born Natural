[Verse 1: Canibus]
I rip up your bones in a funeral home
I'ma find you, whatever computer you on
I'm Rip the Jacker, superego rip rappers
Mix match the code name Squid Chatter
Yeah you on my dick, but it don't matter
I swim in a shark tank and feed off rappers
Animals in a shed on a Moor bed
With four legs and a horse head, we are all dead

"Is anybody out there"

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I'm your godfather's friend, gifted with the pen since ten
Stop, rewind, I'm going over it again
I rhyme from a place within, the voice pulsates
Every living thing listening to me sing
You wanna rhyme spit it, you wanna die, start digging
Now's not the time for religion
Cars ride by with the booming systems
I don't give a fuck if it's broke, I fix it
I don't give a fuck what you wrote, I mix it
Asleep in the bread aisle eating some biscuits
Maronite microphone carved out of alien stone
Look Mom, no hands, it just floats
Maronite microphone carved out of alien stone
Look Mom, no hands, it just floats
Yeah now how y'all feel out there
Hip Hop is here, Hip Hop is everywhere, yeah
