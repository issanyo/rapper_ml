(Canibus)
Just blaze nigga
What?

You wanna battle with a Jesus piece? You need luck
You couldn't see me with a Jacob piece from Jesus
I'll lean you back like your spine just cracked
Rhyme chiropractor, get to adjust raps
Spit something, let me see if I'ma bust back
I front back, I'll go your ass till you collapse
Spin hats around like Sprewell hub-caps
My gun will clap faster than Savion Glover taps
Wave the four at you, if it takes more than that
I'll kick down your door, before you get the double axe
You're trapped with Can-I-Bus, just relax
I came to collect tax, it's as simple as that
I raid your refrigerator, but other than that
Before I leave, I remind you to remember your wack
My girl loves Usher, but she said he getting cocky
I told her, "Shut up," 'cause that's the same way she knocked me
In the name of Hip Hop, I rock beats, on block streets
There ain't an emcee that can stop me
Need more beats, Scott Storch ain't cheap
In Virginia, DMP and Knotz got heat
I get around like Pac and Shock-G
In a drop Jeep, licking off shots Sacchi
It don't have to be a special occasion, I be blazing
I'm Jamaican, you know that I don't worship no pagan
This is real Canibus, leave your nose aching
Niggas be hating, but on the low, they know the flow's dangerous
The Hip Hop Joe Namath, never missed a payment
Don't say shit to me, you talk to the niggas I came with
Kay Slay shit nigga, Drama King nigga
Bada Bing nigga
