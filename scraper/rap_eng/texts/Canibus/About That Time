[Introduction: Canibus]
It's about that time
You know me, I'm about that rhyme
Canibus and Termanology
Two of hip hop's top Gs
Watch, B
Canibus lyrically fit
Termanology spit a million bars
First 16 start like this

[Verse 1: Canibus]
A rack of bombs lay stacked on the floor
Above the doors of the Bombay I can drop bombs all day
Any city all states any place any muzzles they all ate
My metaphors break jaws outta place
30 shots change courses, lock, reload
What up PO?
I throw bullets the size of burritos
Prototype speedboats built by Lockheed on the East Coast
Drag you by the feet with 30 feet of rope
Gotta pay dues dude, put you on Youtube
One million views and that moment you lose
Against the freckle-faced elephant man
With cold, clammy, gelatin hands
Research and develop the plan
Because now everybody hollerin'
Hip hop ain't bringin' the dollars in
Radio got no more tolerance
Objection sustained
Ya'll niggas can't fuck with Germaine
You can't verify the shit that he claim
Just a man in the matrix
I stand by my statements
Every time I run a program they ERASE it!
The plot unfolds
You hear the army snare drum roll
The beat tolls cause you know I've got soul. Yo!
I rap alone strap a microphone 'round my chest
Like a saxophone fully automated battle phones
Canibus and Termanology
White hot speech black box beats
You listenin' to hip hop's chief
Termanology, what's the prophesy
Show them how you got the right to rock wit me
Boy you better fry that beat!

[Verse 2: Terminology - TO BE TRANSCRIBED]

Yo we the last of a dyin' breed
