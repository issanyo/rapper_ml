[Verse 1: Canibus]
Nneka, I can't believe you 'Living Single' like Latifah
When you're the only reason I even bought a beeper
You got me scheming and fiending _____
The only thing between me and sin is ya G-String
Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do to get with a
Dark skinned blackberry molasses type of sister
And at your own risk you can get on top of me
But from that moment on you be Canibus property

[Verse 2: Nneka]
Baby something bout your love I just can't take it
Want you here with me don't keep me waiting
You always seem to know just what to say to me

[Pre-Chorus: Nneka]
You said, "I love you, nothing in the world could shake it
I adore you, no one comes before you lady
I promise to give you everything you need and more"
I need to be sure, say it again

[Chorus: Nneka]
I've been waiting
All this time anticipating
You Say It Again
I've been waiting
All this time anticipating
You Say It Again

[Verse 3: Nneka]
There were others
But none could move me quite the way you do me
I still feel your voice it runs right through me
And I can't seem to get you out my head
Those things you said
All those things you said

[Pre-Chorus: Nneka]

[Verse 4: Nneka]
With all the time we spend every now and then
I need to know I'm your only love, the one for you
So baby make it clear, tell me what I want to hear
Don't be shy, let me know
Baby baby say you love me again

[Verse 5: Canibus]
I used to have you in Atlantic City cashing chips
A hundred square yard garage with flashy whips
Deep down inside I'm the man you missed
Handsome like Malik Yoba without the ashy lips
Whenever we made love it was passionate
But when I popped the question, you never answered it
But I'ma still get you cause nobody can stop me
I take you to court for the custody of your body
Canibus most wanted, who wanna get upon it
I lick you from your toes to your edible under garments
I promise, word to my unborn child, so baby, is you down?
We could do it Bow Wow style

[Chorus: Nneka]
