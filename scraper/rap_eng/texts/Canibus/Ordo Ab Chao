[Break: Canibus]
Yeah, Guerrilla Alliance
Vega X, what's the science?

[Canibus]
In America, hearts and minds start to backslide
Into sorcery, now we being attacked from all sides
How tall is a God? Taller than satellite eyes
In the skies, print in high resolution, standby
Fucking with this rap shit, insurance policies must be active
Especially if your spouse is unattractive
Stop, there ain't no such thing as writers block
Look at all these motherfucking biters going pop
You sound like somebody else, I said stop!
You'll be 'Dead by Design' by the time the album drops
You spend all this time tryna put an album out
And nobody gives a fuck what the album is about
Do you? Don't you dare answer me with your mouth
If Hip Hop was my house, why I gotta get out?
I've been out, been stoned and scrolled, the drum beat, the flow
Your money machine trombones, my rifle unfolds
Stories untold, as if the Hindenburg Omen
Would only affect one soul on this globe
Cannot be taken, it must be given or bestowed
Radio show freestyle, go, rip shows
If the heart desires nothing you will not experience suffering
The crying, the cussing, the red eyes, the rubbing
You are not in control, you are just a puppet
Or Muppet, which was it? Yes, let's change the subject
Muscles expand, rip through pants
Drop kicking niggas tryna take motorcycle trips through France
Siberian Werewolf drinking Smirnoff
Listen to Peter Tosh, vampire don't you dare talk
They walk, they time talk, show hope, start dance in the dark
Large fangs, Wesley Snipes fro-hawk
Kirk Jones sitting in court tryna gather his thoughts
He battled niggas in a tunnel in New York, I saw it
I was there, I applauded, it was 4:34 in the morning
I just witnessed history, I was yawning
I was tired of performing, inspired by the Hip Hop audience
Elo-Elo talks through us, Can-I-Bus
Pacing and leading, writing and reading
All knowledge is increasing, the unknown is receding
The Earth is teeming with life, then scream it on the mic
Real emcees to my left, dope producers to my right
