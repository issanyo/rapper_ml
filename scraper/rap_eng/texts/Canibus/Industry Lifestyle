Yo
Nominated for being underrated
We made a name for ourselves but I guess Common was the only one that made it
I clapped when he won his award
Him and Black Eyed Peas and them, we was on the same tour
And DMX too, you my dog for life
I feel you, I want to see you get yours tonight
Mos Def you on the screen now, following your dreams now
Me, you and Spike Lee used to sit and freestyle
I said two words, they both got bleeped out
If you ever need me again just reach out
I got poses that belong on posters
Pour out all my emotions and double what the gross is
Everybody in the box-office know the flow sick
I want to thank Nottz the producer that chose ‘Bis
Mother-fuckers!

(Canibus)
I want to thank my mother
(I want to thank everybody for coming through and)
I want to thank my brother
(Supporting the film. ‘Cause all the support was very)
My grandmother, my father
(Important. From the beginning I got fans and, you know)
The Father above, the most powerful
(What I mean, cult members that never let me)
You know, I'm just inebriated to be here
(Down from day one. I want to thank you all)

(Canibus)
Yo
I don't want to bite nobody's throat //
I just want to smoke
Yo, pass the ‘dro nigga

(Canibus)
Yo
I can't believe I'm sitting with Don Cheadle, Denzel and Russell Crowe, man
Dave Chappelle, yo, I really like the show man
Ice Cube, yo, we in the next row man
D-12, me and them struck a pose man
With Slim Shady, yo, this must be an omen
I think I'm about to go platinum, I'm explodin'
I'm a fool, man. What am I supposed to do, man?
Red and Meth, ‘How High' part two, man
Bokeem Woodbine bump me in his hood all the time
I want to say, ‘Peace, I'm a fan of yours bro
I seen Hov on 100 Forbo
At the Cannes Film Festival with Sofia Copp(ola)
And Scarlett Johansson, she was with her man-friend
‘Lost in Translation', number one smash hit

(Canibus)
Yo
I'm in the game now
I ran eight miles
I ain't the same old nigga with the same style
The lifestyle of Germaine is my brainchild
Germaine is really like the black John Wayne
Or James Caan negotiating some rhymes for the don
I ain't seen my niggas in so long
We did a short film, ‘4,3,2,1'
It was hot back then when it was new, but
I did this other film ‘Gone ‘Til November'
Me and Wyclef was in the trenches together
I did a big movie with him, he put me on soundtracks
Back then I didn't understand the music business
Every agent found it hard to find me
In the back woods of Holly, rehearsing my hobby
Shout out to R-O-C and State Property
I was inside the beast, shout out to DMP
Peace!

(Canibus)
Yeah
Killah Ki, Shot, Black-N-Deckah, my nigga Star, Nottz
Yeah, stick ‘em
What
Yeah, just sic ‘em
Throw shots
Spread out your face like Botox!
