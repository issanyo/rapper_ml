[Verse 1: Canibus]
Javelins hawk within striking distance
Alert to the sounds we hear, the rapid response verses in the air
I smell the tobacco, we know that you're here
So does the white tail buck and the black bears
What the fuck gave you the right?
To come into the wilderness just to pick a fight?
Whatever jurisdiction you from we rip mics
The B-line of blood trail in the dim light
Back to the kill site
Come here city boy, I hear you're real nice
Surrounded by dark so far from the city lights
Stop browsing, sniff downwind cowards
You pissed yourself, you smell more foul than public housing
Hardcore, parkour, tear off your car doors
Fire-breathing gargoyles, eating hyenas, charbroiled
Alien tongues long sharp but called predator claws
I rip through the Kevlar for your heart
'Till your lower body support lost
The large carnivore Spitboss Beowulf rip your torsos off
Float like the flying Albatross, part Mothman part wasp
Ambush armour transport to the marsh
Javelin Fangz, Germaine's bombing raid campaign
My hands change when I drink Beowulf bane
You ain't seen nothing nearly as strange
Blurry as alien planes, still in the frame but nearly out of range
Canines, Sons of Cain, impervious to pain
Numb off cocaine, ripping railroad tracks off trains
Deranged batshit insane, rhymes liquefy brains
Daydreaming of rain, smoke haze and stargaze
AKs spray photon rage, Sharpshooter sharp fangs
Heart pumpin' napalm through coarse veins
Speak to barmaids, breath reeks of Grand Marnier
She says, "come on behave", I remove my dark shades
Eyes buried behind wrinkles like Shar Peis
I got a scarface from back in my dog days
The posttraumatic microphone mechanic
Leave the habitat damaged when I rat-a-tat that ratchet
You fucking with the Sharpshooter Masters

*beat change*

[Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine
In the beginning I made lyrics, now lyrics make me
You’re listening to Rip The Jacker II: Infinity
This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
Surround you with a layer to the left, to the right
To the front to the back, with a rap and a mic
For satellite rappers delight, you battle for your life
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
The cedar wood burns, my heating is rightfully earned
I take you on a journey through the words
In the mind, hold your hand with an infinite rhyme
For a time I know it makes you shy, but that’s fine
Come along with me, let me show you how hard it can be
To spit like the 100 Bar Beast
An extra large dosage of the dopeness
How can I be anything but focused as the spitbar soldier
The rhyme equity above quota
Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for
Walk around confused, listening to tunes
Music is my muse, Can-I-Bus this abuse?
Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones
Nah, I just work for him
I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime
For how it was remembered and seen
Mission requires a plan, armed personnel and staff
But tradition demands I be a more primitive man
Three standard 16s; fade the record at 3:35
Grim reaper axe, kick to your spine
Pound after pound, I come stomp on your brain
Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain

[Chorus x4: Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine

[Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
That’s when you know your times up Germaine
Don’t forget you nice, you fit the right archetype
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
