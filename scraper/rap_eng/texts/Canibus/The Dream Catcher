Religion is the producer on the ones and twos
Dangerous, the dream catcher just for your
Religion is the producer on the ones and twos
Dangerous, the dream catcher just for your

[Verse 1: Canibus]
The dream catcher, dangerous rappers
Content, be out of context for the masses
Hard body, hardware, trigger happy halfwit
Vernacular gymastics
A ten player rebalanced, I was standing my talent
No desire for power, hypnotize minds through an eye on an album
Heart rate slows down some
My thoughts are supreme, I hogtie my dreams
Then line up together, to try to see what they mean
It all comes back to the same theme
I'm a Microphone Fiend
You just standing in between what I need
I am free, but only for a moment on the  M-I-C
Four systems trying to track my ID
Dangerous forefather, poor pauper MC
FOR THE PAST MONTH HE’S BEEN SUSPENDED IN PART THREE
I SEE, BOTH DEVIL AND GOD AGREE, NOBODY RHYME LIKE ME
Mcrophones EXPLODE, UNDER ATTACK BY PEEPHOLE SCOPIC DRONES
COMMUNICATING POEMS, PHONES TRANSMUTANT TONES
SOUNDWAVES CRASH THROUGH STONE, INCLUDING HUMAN BONE
Zone to my zone, dream catcher
Canibus dangerous now you know
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow

[Verse 2: Dangerous]
You can't spell MANIFEST WITHOUT MAN
You can't spell PLANETARY WITHOUT PLAN
You can't spell DANGEROUS WITHOUT DAN
And tou can't spell CANIBUS WITHOUT CAN
SIMILAR TO CANIBUS, I GET CANNIBALISTIC
VERBALLY MURDERING MC’S ANOTHER STATISTIC
COMPARABLE TO CANIBUS CALL ME A CANNIBAL
WE THE A-TEAM, I’M FACE, HE’S HANNIBAL
DYNAMIC DUO, DANGEROUS, CANIBUS
DO YOU HAVE THE MENTAL BANDWIDTH FOR UNDERSTANDING THIS
DANGEROUS LIKE CANIBUS, MELATONIN MAGIC
MICROPHONE HAVOC, CRISIS ZONE MADNESS
TRAGIC TRAGEDIES, MY LACK OF APATHY
ALLOWS ME TO CAUSE CATACLYSMIC CATASTROPHIES
GET AFTER ME, BLAST AT ME, THAT WOULD BE BLASPHEMY
RAPIDLY ENLIGHTENMENT HUMANITY, THEN THE GALAXY
I ACTUALLY, HAVE TO BE, THE NEW BREED OF RAP MC
GRAPHICALLY, MATHEMATICALLY, INTERGALACTICALLY
SPARATICALLY, THROUGH THE UNIVERSE AND THE MULTIVERSE
NOT EVEN THE VOICE OF GOD, COULD INSULT THESE WORDS
PIN POINT PRECISION, PAST PANDEMONIUM
PERFECTLY POSTED, PROUD AT THE PODIUM
PERPOSTEROUS, IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP MY CONLGLOMERATES
PROMINENCE, DOMINANCE, CONQUER EVERY CONTINENT
PARLIAMENT, CONGRESS, NOBODY STOPPING IT
THE OPPOSITE, THEY WATCHING, AS I START BOMBING, BOOM!

Dhe dream catcher, Canibus, dangerous, now you know
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow
Get ready get set go, respected over the globe
For verbal kinetic soul, of ultra magnetic flow
