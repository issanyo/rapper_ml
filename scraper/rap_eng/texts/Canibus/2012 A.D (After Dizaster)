[Verse 1: Canibus]
They want an explanation, they want a reason
It's all these goddamn demons
Crawling creeping, bounty hunt emcees every weekend
Throwing people off the deep end
I can't beat them, I'm just glad to be breathing
I stretch towards the ceiling
Shoulder getting better everyday I work it out, I smoke out
Then I go say the verses with my mouth
Number one in Hip Hop and I ain't even mean it
The worst rapper alive? I don't agree with
Choked up, so what? He was defeated
But if he's in that zone, he tear you to pieces
Stop talking like that, Canibus bark when I rap
You gotta factor all the facts
I keep it relative so they can understand me
I got a bunch of relatives in Miami
Money making Manny, big booty Brandy
Tom Clancy on a hundred footed yacht named Nancy
You seen Germaine's set? You ain't entertained yet?
You might wanna catch the main event

2012 AD yeah the summer season
Some missed the meaning and some will receive it
Few consumers purchase the music, some steal it
Some really achieve success, some only dream it
Some are conceited and greedy but don't wanna believe it
They point the finger at others to give themselves credence
They search for excuses to try to chop down your roots Bis
They try to make you buy back your freedom
The brightest beacon becomes stronger not weaken
Rip the Jacker's master thesis, love it or leave it
They make it sound like I never loved the rhythm of Rap
I gave them music to listen to it with rhythm and tact
For Ten Thousand Bars Can-I-Bus should get a grammy
For Infinite composition theory and planning
Status quo antebellum Rap music never thanked me
Plus I lost a battle, that's a double whammy
You ain't got no empathy than you ain't understanding me
Real Hip Hop is channelled through me
It ain't no crime to not be the best
When I was you acted like I wasn't so what you expect?

[Verse 3: Canibus]
The holy angels are screaming, everything happens for a reason
But they don't wanna believe it
Hip Hop was everything to me, it's no secret
The ink that I write with, is the ink that I bleed with
Retrospectively speaking the heart keeps pumping
The lungs keep breathing, everything happens for a reason
I'ma always have something coming out
Infinity is a very large amount
I wrote it out and cried out to Jesus the dead got it easy
The living gotta pick up the pieces
The Lord saved me and show me the meaning
Of what it feels like to be dissed and deleted
No grief period needed, my mission is completed
That's why I started the battle by praising Jesus
I stood there in front of the world and took a dagger to the heart
Then I launched 10,000 Bars
Canibus career is over? It can't be
If only Hip Hop would stand with me
I don't want your money I want your respect
I paid my Hip Hop dues but can't cancel the debt
