I wanna see humankind rise, I wanna see it wit' my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop, I want aliens to listen to hiphop

[Verse1: Canibus]

[Verse2: Canibus]
Scanned 51 (trainin' in the misty rain)
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day

Lyric for lyric, layer for layer, prayer for prayer
My purification process is created

Doing weight room sex

The Marauds of Night
I only say it once (Let there be light!)
I'll attack you twice (rebels that fight corporate devils)
Prepare my river sacrifice for (my ritual rights)
The Melanin Knight battles at night on satellite
Life is light, tell me yo' How can I not be nice? S*anned 50

Read your thoughts like an NSA paralegal
He has the keys to (technology) own self

Pacing back and forth (like I'm batshit crazy)
Vlad the Impaler!!
