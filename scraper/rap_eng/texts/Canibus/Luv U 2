[Chorus]
There's a reason why you keep callin my name out of the blue
If it's because you love me, then I love you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you love me, I'll say I love you too

[Canibus]
Yo yo, I love my life; I love my wife
I love my daughter; and I love my mic
If you love me, I love you, I'm humble
I won't do things to bug you and start trouble
If you want an autograph, I'ma sign it
I don't care if the plane's leavin and I get left behind it
I'm not that simple-minded
If I had the time, I'd probably type it, or get Stan to write it
You don't shower Canibus with kindness cuz he's the nicest
You do it cuz you genuinely like him
Sure I'll talk to you in private
You might get backstage tickets or ice cream for your politeness
Shake my hand if you like Bis
But you can give me a hug if you got love, try it
Extend ya arms around me, then bend ya arms
Spread the love, a virus created by God
I'm really speakin from the heart cuz I'm touched by you
And I'm glad that you love me, cuz I love you too!

[Chorus]

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!

[Chorus]

[Pakman]
Yeah I know you got love, when you see me you wanna hug me
All excited, hoppin around like the Easter Bunny
I'm like a puppy, all I wanna do is lay down and cuddle
That's why I'm happy that you could finally say that I love you
Nothin wrong with showin feelings to me, cuz I'ma G
And so I can tell you overwhelmed by the way that you breathin
Know you ran up here to see me, wishin that you could be me
Callin people at home while they watchin me on the TV
I'm a household name, with the power to spit flames
Then I flip and give the children somethin they can get with
You love me, then why you got that look in ya eye?
Why every single time you see me you be actin surprised?
No it ain't all for nuttin somethin got to be somethin
And I ain't givin you no paper, so you got to be frontin
What was you doin at ten shows I tore down overseas
And it's funny how you was at the album signing in Queens
Ain't hard to tell you lovin anything connected with Pak
And once I recognize I be the type to give it back
Don't try to fool me, been doin this, I'm no dummy
On a mission to get it, and I'm winnin, you gotta love me!

[Chorus]

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!

[Chorus]
