[Verse 1: Cloak, aka Canibus]

Yo, I do thumb push ups till hands numb
Then I get in the club, they ban the rum
Crush rapper groups this how Cloak N Dagga do
After this reboot, we emcee-proof
Rhymes on deck, check the chart specs
Light your ass up, it ain't even dark yet
Its hard to digest high-tech rhyme specs
Design techs ain't seen nothin' like mine yet
Great, got the last crate, motor voice box in stock
Since you want that I give you what I got
We stand by the burn-barrel
Tryin' to stay warm and act natural
Soldiers do what they have to
Do Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Cee
I sing it to myself till I fall asleep
Walkin' is restricted, everybody crawl or creep
There's been a sniper on the loose for a week
Park my striker on the street
Open the hatch, stand on the seat
Catch an RPG with my teeth
Wherefore art thou noble emcee
We seek, your blood we drink your flesh we eat
Too strong, the unicorn with bullhorns
Destroy a million civilian, new cars
Bite the flesh out the beast neck like T-Rex
With mince-meats a row of teeth three feet thick
Sleepless nights, bed-less sleeps
My belief is anything with teeth got the right to eat
Ayo Dagga, the beat sick talk that street shit
When the jeep's on the strip: Pussy meet Dick
Satellites watch me, they think they got me
Right hands turn, left shoulder's around but its not me
What up poppie? Shot up on the block, cocky
In hotels my cloak drag across the lobby
Pick the beat up on my back my knees crack
Ma' fucka we the sickest emcees in rap
Cloak N Dagga that scatter raps across the map
Its like that!

[Hook:  Phoenix Orion singing in Jamaican accent]

So listen

Just back up back up
Get shot up shot up
Gun clap, clap
So you don't wanna fuck with that

Just back up back up
Gun shot up shot up
Gun clap
(Canibus joins in)
Noooo! You don't wanna fuck with that

[Verse 2: Phoenix Orion aka Dagga]

Man we don't be like no others
Me and band of brothers
Duck, you whack motherfuckers, and run for cover
Bust off your gat, push you big back
Put bullet holes through your fuckin' skullcaps
Shit's on like psych on, I keep the mic on
Nigga proof extra warm with Aquaform
Rhyme with you like hellspawn
Children of the Corn injected with napalm
In both our forearms
Literally spit bombs cause emcees harm
Change the alarm, I lost my mind when I lost my mom
Two soldiers of fortune, mass distortion
Killa rapper he was coughin' up blood in his coffin
Make you wish he wasn't a boss
And that's what you get for flossin'
Whip ass and drink crude like Steve Boston
Stone cold body bag of bones on the microphone
I break bones killa [  ] protect they own
So many varieties a secret society
Code Name C n D they wanna murder me or hire me
Agent PXO was AWOL
Off the wall the big brawl I got somethin' for ya'll
Walkin' tall with a big stick to break shit
Run up in the label break the table make a hit
Gotta know who you're fuckin' with
I'm not Jadakiss, gotta death wish?
Give this motherfucker a death kiss
Rhymin' reckless you get your ass kicked
Melt you to the plastic
Smokin with tha ziggy-zig
That's what you whack niggas get for talkin' shit
The C n D clique ice box you with a big rig
Call "Freeze!" Emcees with higher degrees
Trigger-happy firing squad, they're ready to squeeze
Gotcha beggin' for mercy down on your knees
Crying please but you're still R.I.P
D.O.A., C n D we don't play
Fuck around with weapon X it be a mortar today
The harder they come the harder they fall
All ya'll can get it, God squad is large
Can you deal with it?
Fuck that nigga get back, gun clap clap clap clap
Cloak N Dagga man
(With Canibus) No fuckin' with that!

[Hook]

[Outtro: Phoenix Orion talk-singing and singing in Caribbean accent]

Tombstones, got it owns, gonna mash up di place
Mash up di place
Mash up di place
Code name, Cloak N Dagga, agents without a face
No time to waste
You muffin, mash up di place
Bwoy-a you don't want it but you think you got it best
I dare you to go pub without a bullet proof vest
Dig it, try it, Cloak'll stick a dagger in your chest
Body bag of bones, I'm gonna leave a bloody mess
Gonna kill you right away, where you stand is where you lay
Tombstone, God have mercy, motherfuckers every day
