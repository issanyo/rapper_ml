[PLOO MIX]

[Hook]
RTJ Infinity
Bar war rappin the temple of tranquility
10 thousand bars, nobody do it better
There ain't a truer ripper
Rip the jacker forever

[Verse: Canibus]
Rip the Robot; RTR
Also known as a perpetual poetry drone
2013; the RTR bill is enacted
The first special access project to track down rappers
Deploy, Seek out, locate and destroy
Rip the Robot, the most advanced MC android
Go ahead, laugh at him, bet you can't outrap him
Created 250 thousand years after Adam
Real MC status, three key factors
Include three times a day rapping to a beat that matches
He made advances to the english language
Far above the present day standard
At a time when no one had any answers
Hes a joint task force robot, so what?
Nobody raps like rip the robot does
RTR digital vulture, mars rover vocal controller
He consolidates this complex culture
Bull rider, leer jet provider on the tar-mac
Exchanging trade secrets with a secret admirer
I mean, why would any human being assume
Theyre more intelligent, less irrelevant, or equally eloquent?
Pull yourself together, rip
We agreed we wouldn't get into that rhetoric
Heres some digital medicine
Turn that music down, or turn it off
But this is how so many foreigners learned to talk
Man created government
Government created laws
Laws create corruption
Corruption create wars
Nobel laureate poets attempted to describe what they saw
The precursor RTR was born
Then shortly after updated
With automated reading, writing, and speech syncopation
Software interpretation
Recognition to interfaces with natural native language dictation
From RTJ's layered platform databases
Wow, simply the greatest cloud computing from the great chamber
Rip the robot omega
Rtr simply the greatest cloud computing from the great chamber
Rip the robot omega

Finally, vocal cords no longer vibrate
RTR will provide an infinite soundscape
The program broke down, and none of us know how we escape
And now nobodies rap style is safe

Initiate RTR protocol: 12212012
Acquiesce any potential targets
Cross-reference all semantic effects and causes
Arm your bar war bombers
Locate and harvest
Any uncompliant or defiant rap artists
