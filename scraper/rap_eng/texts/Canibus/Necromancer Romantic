[Intro: Guilty Smiles and Canibus]
Yeah
Yeah
Canibus, Guilty Smiles
The Alice Game
Hip hop will never sound the same

[Verse 1: Guilty Smiles]
Yo
Pass the gravy, royalty dances masquerading
Knight from the last crusade is sane but actin' crazy
Rap amazing
You wanna combat? The master's waiting
You swear that you're better than me? I'm past debating
Smiles and Bis, the blackest mages
Crafting pages, rhyming from the grimoires
Necronomicon in the application
Fascination when I burn the stage down
Amaze crowds, quick draw Holliday, say when? Well I say now
I'm your Huckleberry, drunk piano player, aim and shoot it
If you came to do it
Make you the past like ancient druids
Casting fire, necromancer magic
Blasting your entire squad
Telepathic bending iron bars with the might of Gods
Deeper than the sight of stars, if you fly to Mars
My minds a bomb, explosions that destroy entire songs
I am honorably mentioned
I have marketing attention
I could spit more bars than a Department of Corrections
A bar for every second, after the end it will go silent
And when I'm dead in the grave I'll be a ghost writer
War fighters attack, stand your ground
Circumstance said "strike from the back to mask the sound"
Romance the crowd, dance with the Queen on sacred ground
Hi Alice, all of the games have made me proud
It's a strange world we live in
Watchya making now?
Moving divisions of maps consulted by Eva Braun
Drop it like a bunker buster
I don't feel I can trust her
Mustard gas from the Russian bombs sampled as percussion
Ask my brothers; vodka and soda, cash and comfort
You can keep all your radio spots, I ask for nothin'
This is ominous, bars that I spit are beyond monsterous
But A&R's sponsorship is based only on politics
I'm not certain, I'm positive
One word could accomplish it - moronic
Your main stream is beyond the preposterous

[Hook: Guilty Smiles and Canibus]
Necromancer Romantic, spitting this classic
Beyond monsterous
Fuck around with Rip
Canibus and Guilty Smiles wylin'
What the fuck you wanna do now boy?
Necromancer magic, blasting your entire squad
Burn the stage down, drop it like a bunker buster
Necromancer Romantic, the lyrical law
Hip hop will never sound the same

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I'm a new-age nation creation, and Guilty Smile an inspiration for every living derivative of human nature
Human or animal, alien, formal or casual; true story hallucinatory or magical
Battle-you attitude, improve a microphone aptitude
Tools I use to take it to back to school
True beluga whale brain cells, blue-man supercomputer Homosapien male
Crazy as hell
Powered by Intel, for real
I save struggled rap by the bell
I wrote his name on a cartridge with a thousand shells
On a cold mountain slope, dual eyepiece for a scope
"Don't miss". "Muthafucka', I won't!"
The eye o' the sniper
Transfix, zoom in tighter
The hammer click, feelin' hyper than viper bitin' the mystery writer
Black iris, rap Osiris grip the mic 'till I get arthritis
Javelin-tooth tiger with bronchitis
Gold bars from King Midas come in all sizes
Prince Pyro's saliva could start forest fires
The borders are private when ten thousand bars are united
I'm 'bout to show you a quarter and get you all excited
Hip-Hop is my bitch, so don't even try it
Don't deny it, Canibus with Guilty Smiles wylin'
Pig Latin assassin, born in a dirty log cabin
We live off acid, termites, and aspirin
Rolling up that zigzag, mad niggas is laughin’, we old school but what we spitting is classic
Paper or plastic? Necromancer Romantic
Roaming frantic, Cracker Barrel apparel with a fat ass bitch
Cooking hash browns and grits
Fuck around with Rip? I'll hunt you down with bloodhounds and ticks
With Lyme disease, flies and fleas, you can't see, collide with trees
My Marines piss on emcees
Pine-Sol colored, thought the crime was solved but it wasn't
Got sawed in half by a psychopath SAW gunner
Rusty ass metal melt rubber, motherfuckin' food for the buzzards
Dirty Harry's my brother and I'm his ugly cousin
Whistling Dixie, get up there and grip that fifty
My breath stink, my mustache smell fishy
Tell Nikki that her pussy is squishy, she gettin' money, she pretty
I'm still livin’ like a bum in the city
Skid Row skinny, but still get busy
Look me up on Wiki
If ripping beats is a crime I'm guilty
You put a quarter in my cup? It's a rizzy
Y'all niggas know what it is, fuck with me
Guilty Smiles, Rip the Jacker, don't need no more back up
When we on the track you gettin' wrapped up
Dynamite alloys, salty ass soy sauce cowboys
What the fuck you gonna do now boy?!
Foul Ball, Guilty Smiles, clear it out y'all
Around here we the lyrical law

[Hook: Guilty Smiles and Canibus]
Necromancer Romantic, spitting this classic
Beyond monsterous
Fuck around with Rip
Canibus and Guilty Smiles wylin'
What the fuck you wanna do now boy?
Necromancer magic, blasting your entire squad
Burn the stage down, drop it like a bunker buster
Necromancer Romantic, the lyrical law
Hip hop will never sound the same
