[Canibus]
Yo, who stopped ya? Separate the rappers from the actors
The doctors from the proctobiologists
Can't speak with common sense
You got a dent in the medulla oblongata and lost some skills, 5%
Imma rock again, how much you wanna bet?
Might throw a little fit, drown you with a little spit
From the USA to Cairo
Took the high road to Mohenjo Daro cause I'm a pharaoh
If there was no tomorrow
I'd still be the most sophisticated model of wordological babble
The speech is called double speak
For example if I said I was to bust the heat
'Til the sky touch your feet
Open your eyes look at the concrete
My name ain't Germaine now you got the wrong beef
It ain't Canibus neither you got the wrong leaf
You think Hitler's dead but you got the wrong teeth
Like me rocking on another beat, right now
While you still listening to this one, blah-dow
Being followed by a black cloud
So I'ma just keep on rhyming and look at the ground
I'll look up if you pass it around
I'm the best lyricist hands down
Motherfucker just look at your hands now
Who stopped ya?  Rap tighter than an anaconda
Only one problem my work com subs
Syllables rush through the position of the teeth and the tongue
Mouth to mic to speakers 'til its deep in your drum
Speak with the tongue 'til sounds like I'm speaking in tongues
When I'm done I'll leave you needing a lung
Don't have to get up
Cause I been up
Doin' sit-ups and chin-ups
And an army chin-up, I rip shit up
Punch y'all for pair of fist cuffs with fist clutch
When I'm getting my dick sucked I resuscitate sick sluts
Getting they clits mixed up
Stick a plug in the butt
OK Bis you been explicit enough
Who stopped ya, who stopped ya?
