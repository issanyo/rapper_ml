[Chorus]
The wait is over
You want to be a boss, I'ma show ya
It's almost time
For the brotherhood to shine
For any and all that want to rhyme
We invite emcees to Spitboss dot com

The wait is over
Whoever want to be a boss, I'ma show ya
It's almost time
For any and all who want to rhyme
January two thousand and nine
We invite emcees to Spitboss dot com

The wait is over, it's almost time
For the brotherhood to shine
For any and all who want to rhyme
We invite emcees to Spitboss dot com

[Verse]
(Yeah, yo!)
I've battled emcees for ten years straight
Cptn Cold Crush, been Bus since '88
My dogs rush the gate
The lockjaw'll crush your face
You try to stink rap but can't replace
Ten thousand bars, nobody could keep that pace
I wrote it in layers, nobody could run that race
Or counteract my sharp shooter attack
Superhuman rap, you're wack
You'll face my executioners' axe
My utility belt's stacked on Pro Tools and tracks
The old boom-bap, boom-bap Buddha is back
Out of sight, out of mind, got to write, got to rhyme
Got to grind, got to get mine, I'll show you how to shine
Spitboss dot com is a shrine it was designed
To show them the code of arms in the lines of the rhymes
Of my timebomb ticking with infinite bars spitting
All different. Calling all Rippers for lyrical business
I'm a spit boss!

[Outro]
You're ready to be a boss?
Prove it!
Spitboss!
