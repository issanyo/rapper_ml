I can't do it, we'll do it live
We'll do it live!
Do it live! I'll write it, and we'll do it live!
Fucking thing sucks!

[Blaq Poet]
It a slaughter, nigga
Mickey and Malary style
Y'all niggas is dead, and people calling me foul
Cross you off the list, and chuck you over
Lets get this shit settled, right here and right now
I got this hard shit in a smash
I'm about the cash
Stop looking nigga, I'm the last
Motherfucker, you gon' meet like this
Turn your day pitch black, like I clicked the light switch
The beatle stickle played it Run up in the chamer
In the clip there remained the blastin off in anger
The black monster, strike like the black momba
Have you motherfuckers running home to your momma
Stay in your fucking place
You know that I'm an ace
If not, get the taste out your fucking face
Everything I say, I mean it
I'm a black motherfucker, straight outta Queensbridge

[Skarlet Rose]
Drama in the city, streets is pretty
We asking God for mercy but he showing you no pity
You hope for a miracle
When your fate was cynical
The only thing that mattered was if you had your pistol full
Sit back, uncontrolled rages
[?] playing on different stages
Rocking live vibes be contagious
Who we are, cats who die
Never make it too far
We're quick to talk about things we should've done and never did it
Things we started and never finished
[?] children look at us with empty wishes
They growing up with no restrictions, I wonder why
Miscommunication, across the great states
Blood flows down heaven's gates
And we await our torturous fates
[?]
But only those with knowledge seem to see it biblically
It's a harsh reality
[?] mentality
Unholy matromonies
Your true boys is true phonies
Shadows creepin while you're sleepin
Young widows weepin
Trust in these cats when you meet them
This teach men before they descend

(awaiting to be finished)

[Canibus]
The appetite of megaladon pumping steroids in his arm
His upper torso is bigger than yours
Brave men will die
Women will cry over the genocide
But don't cry, dry... your eye
My left brain twenty percent, my right brain is more than that
My pituitary gland is on crack
That's why they barely understand where I'm at
And why I rap, they say it's wack
It's not wise to react, why's that
Cause consciously I'm black
Subconsciously I'm darker than that
The most controversial artist in rap
When I step with my lyrics, I force them to fall back
I was wounded in combat, and still crawled back
Do it right the first time, I don't ever have to do it again
Unless I rehearse it again and again
Rotating floating spheres like clockwork rotating gears
Counter-clockwise collating what you hear
Over here, don't repeat what you heard
Just remember what you learned
Remember the last time you got burned
Qualitative analysis is not enough to quantify Canibus
But do it live if you think you can handle this
