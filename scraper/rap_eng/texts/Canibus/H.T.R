[Chorus: Canibus & Phoenix Orion] X2
'H' is for the Head
'T' is for the Trauma
'R' is for the Wreck shop
Here comes the Unabomber

'H' is for the Head
'T' is for the Trauma
'R' is for the Wreckshop
I'ma bring the drama

[Verse One: Phoenix Orion]
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, H.T.R. we bang-bang
Marcy we slang things, Brooklyn we got gangs
Head Trauma runnin' things
Hot cars, guns and things
Wifey got the diamond rings
I bless my Queen with all the bling
You want them jewels, I gotchu!
Lift fools, out they shoes
Make your homey spiritual
Then embalm your physical
And body bag your dude
I know my streets is rude
I'm 'bout to eat y'all for food
Hannibal, cannibal, animal, call me manipal
The street corner cat, nickel and dime store rap
With the Tommy gun attack, brrt.!brrt.!
When Head Trauma bring the drama, get back, get back
Dogs fall back; do the dance 'Lean Back'
Dice and Mack on the track, H.T.R. where you at?
High rollers holla back, holla back
Marcy, Brooklyn, BX on the city of sin, high rollin'!

[Chorus: Canibus & Phoenix Orion] X2

[Verse Two: Canibus]
'H' is for the head, where the dreams are kept
'T' is for the tourniquet wrapped around my leg
'R' is for the color of the blood that I bled
Don't give a fuck what I said cause we brothers 'til the end
You got mine, I got yours, we survived five tours
Nigga, you my dog, four of them was my wars
When I seen them I cry and bawl 'til my eyes get sore
I'm tryin' to get my life back on course
'H' is for the Horror
'T' is for the Trauma
'R' is for the Rockets on the radar Doppler
'H' is for the Hades
'T' is for the Trainin'
My rheumatism acts up when it starts rainin'
Gotta get past the pain, and keep rappin'
Mathematic magic make me a microphone assassin
Rap so loud, rap with a growl
Rap like I'm tryin' to block the whole world out
If I don't know what to say, I don't say nothin'
But if I don't know what to bus', I'ma keep bussin'
Steel-fist lines, trigger grasshopper-mines
For fifty yards at a time, when I spit rhymes
In the daytime, people look through my shaded blinds
I tell them; I've got to take my time
Investigate; draw the name on the template
Search, segregate, silence, meditate
Speed to the rear, safe-guard, interrogate
Slap you in the face, show you how lyrics taste
I'ma order steak so don't act like a ape
Or I'ma never take you on another dinner date

[Chorus: Canibus & Phoenix Orion] X2
