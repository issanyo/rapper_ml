[Verse 1:  Canibus]

M-Eighty
Guiness Book of World Record
I hold the seraphin Shady
You know we love hip hop baby
I took the 360 day field trip to the Milky Way
All expense paid hip hop holiday
The audio blaze I'm physically engaged
Visually the display changed to a spiritual
Collisional cascade
When I rap this way
Generation X, Generation RTJ
I praise the creator for doing me a favor
My theta waves translate into some dark thoughts on paper
Personal labor  in the pyramid chamber
Concentratin'  on  the prime dwarf and the doomsday danger
Propulsion attraction propulsion action
Taos in New Mexico is where they closed rappers
Revolution right here raise that ratchet
To blow you out the bracket
Rip the Jacker


[Verse 2:  M-Eighty]

M-Eighty
Rhymes are incitin' greatness
Hitler teachin' youth with these track on your playlist
Run circles in these aces
Hip hop basics these laces
Fitted for fitness like the Matrix
[Taken ]
Got my dame dash in the stash
By your anklet
Revolvers a must  prime revelation
Patience a virtue to murk you
Unearth you
Tactics I print like Cs ease the body  crew
Botty Boy Boom bash
Shotty blast killer rap
Militant Matter of rap Rip the Jacker is Back
Click clack comstacks
Quick tracks outlast
And the emcee in my path
Who's master's not amassed the wealth
Knowledge born college dorm
Where Neil Arm spit fire!
The cajun corridor time for [ ]  in the commons
We bombin' 'em and [ ] such a charmin'
You will see the architect designin' the future of rhymin'
