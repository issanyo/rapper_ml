[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, niggas is phony, fronting like they're Master of Ceremonies

Ever since '84, I've been in it to win it
But see back then we used to battle by spinning on the cement
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved
I travel to the end of the Universe and beyond
Parsecs out of range from a cellular StarTec
From the galaxy of Andromeda
I puzzle niggas like crop circles and other unexplained phenomena
