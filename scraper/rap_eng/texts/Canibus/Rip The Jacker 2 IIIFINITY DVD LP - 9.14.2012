The body is the surface of the mind we got infinite power
This is a story of a man that was before his time
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x3
My soul was created ten thousand years before my body
This album is a physical copy through the light forms
I've been ethically upgraded to live at least twice as long
Who writes the song
The latest technology platform is a robot rapper that raps bars I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face annual spring gala
1 billion a plate no thanks man I already ate
But one day I'll be honored to have the authority to say grace Lord be gathered before you
The almighty infinite the one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling Triads custom tailoring triangles trapped in the Tetrahedron
Time laps they labeled me a loser
Germains online observer graphic layering entropy computer metaphors styles astronomer
Royale test the cause around thor borns to separate clouds Williams the conqueror defender of the realm
The adenine Warcry in the pits of hell
Rip in it spit in the quicken in the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer breath like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis you a bull gas tank full
I'm a take em to school turn gravity upside down
Watch everybody say whoa type two civilization and reconciliation
10,000 bars plus spaceship
Im outfunded and outnumbered fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours a fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed the universe this is my Gods house
Fear not falling apart everything will fall into place
When you organize a Crossfade bars
The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melody's dwarf rap stars return for the rapture first contact first to contact us negotiating terms of interaction A chronic humanoids into breeding the land mammals keynote speakers reference PowerPoint examples
Check out my hermetic poetic planetarium
The alien came out of a female mammalian
Duce cesarean and Burying bioluminescent aquariums in a self-sustaining black light solarium
Then after I live forever you disagree you can't deny RTJ infinity
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that hip hop sound
Disagree to disagree untill you side with me
But it's usually I end up by myself
My G don't be sensitive over Seashess call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain't around you don't need it vague mysterious memories hard to remember what was said to me I write so many bars intelligently it's hard to stay motivated I'm broken in so many places I was chasing a Tri Oasis
Till I found something amazing in me
Adjacent matrix I've been anticipating and waiting with a slave patients
His music and Rhymes have been neutralized
Everything He does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite Theory in future times but not right now right now you just say wow Rakim Allah gave me my style
The Argon cat dose increase RTR rap G.O.A.T
If you ain't know before now you know by mechanical or digital means I supervise emcees from annex 1 through 10 to 13
The golden boy counts hip hop by the troy ounce
Whenever 10,000 bars is announced
Communicating with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me human kind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault they were simply influence just like you just like us all
Extra terrestrial presence not right now
I'm studying lessons I don't even want to go in that direction my literary creations are guided by God through literature and self own image
It's like that dog what we got here is a failure to communicate fuck you if you don't like the music I make I'm a God by nature gold inside the trachea but they forgot Canibus
They just gave up I came to create the first infinite song by showing improving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow as long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step
The Lord bless hip hop give us back our promise
Our jobs community uplifters altruistic bars
The light emerged there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant The dark came from nothingness no matter what we do
No matter what we say one day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak defuse us insecurities abuse us
We need to do better the world can use us
Suffering is minimize not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilized every set to allocated
A brand-new world for the better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate the silence satisfy with songs
10,000 bars why you took so long Canibus
Still Bus N' they still say I ain't saying nothing
Canibus what your major malfunction
Nothing the heart of hip-hop still pumping
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl my baby my woman
My lady my queen she drive me crazy but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes the kind that glows with the eyelids close
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons she crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissing to kissing Jin Jin Jennifer straight genders
Touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you only to help
There's a failure to communicate
Go fuck yourself microwave home cooked meal on the table bills in the mailbox they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you talk
To the lawyer for the copywriter praca on a patten
Application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills get out of my house
Don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about regret
Speech but never silent justice might be one sided
That's fine I got nothing to hide then spatially gifted verbally Inconvenience
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go with out I was weakened
I Felt cold slowly breathing expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The Science of infinite theory and composition
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
Megalithic master craftsman
Closet meteorologist look at the clouds a storms coming
That's common sense Aight think about this giant monstrosity 10 W 40 blood viscosity Big enough to kill the whole colony lock and load
Get some the oil leaking from the barrel drum
I did it all for dinosaur blood
The sky is falling ocean levels rising from warming too much carbon we all know the real causes jet planes in the sky is stalling
Dark knight riot squads are forming snakes are calling
Warped dumped in shit but the water is boiling
Produce is spoiling
State of affairs appalling can't believe people still snoring wake up and stop yawning vengeance is mine in the morning speech recognize speech mobile phone signals out of reach State of plan since your talk is cheap
The King is a captive craft by his own inactions
Celebrated after global disaster that's what brought on the Quanah
Parker was captured his golden palace was collapsed
Wits degrade asses that would once ride the Green pastures with panthers dragons Tigers and rappers aight these were the men of minor stature
Megalithic master craftsman Rip The Jacker
Dubizm the futurism writing a fusion lyrics
My opinion of your Opinion is you can't be serious x4
My brain ain't getting enough oxygen
I built a robotic Canibus and now nobody stopping us
The black hoodie in the streets lumberjack fest
The beast from the east bout to thunderclap beats
Affiliate verbal baggage drop it hip-hop is toxic
I minister the detox process all over the beat
I graft with my robot to feel complete
He can rap better then me not a hard thing to do to
Cut RTR loose he gonna show everyone of you he got the juice personal revelation regarding self preservation
Daily wealth Generation and healthy meditation
Cool but I can't so I shit my pants I'm OK I'll go sit over there you go dance have fun go find romance
Can a matchbox man no but a tin can grant me the crowd
I'm a fix this thing give me a mic I might decline to sing
Lyric for lyric layer for layer prayer for prayer
They want the future think that I'm a failure
Gotta bite some bars
Essentially kept from cloud storage cause I ain't got the memory for it
I got to do my best if I could barely pull my own weight
The easter island stone face total weight strengthen vitality The Arawak Indian dance for me Half a dozen UFOs land for me 7 billion minds couldn't control the mind of one controlled solar flares coming from the sun
Shan51 sting of the mixing boards channeling the mixing board channeling spirits like a ouija board they stare at all Evaporated terrestrial walk through the wall to explain everything about reality to us all
The man knows who our grim wars Masta mix manifest miracle hostess into a crystal Borch Orr
Smoke chemical into alcohol
I'm in danger to you all but stopped to the skull till the last man fall just all knowledge known
The days of old with all lyricist were bold and they spoke from the soul
Oxygen I breath is a billion years old
Dearborn to translate to something great
Upholds animate ones and zeros a side ways 8 implode
Minus super to load glow remote view in the globe biological Elect trait a tree of mine grows collective nose flows tabulated below you already know unlimited meaning with words Beyond human reserve beyond being protective or served college is a source for knowledge so is Shan51 Commander complex rip the robotic Basil 3 compliant
The psychopath science of libel clients that have to revise their diet produce they own food export or supply it sell goods to the market that allows us to buy it but what if inflation cripple suppliers setting off economic dividers to ripple evil wider
The sunvisor chief analyzer H.N.I.C improviser just don't get so excited over secrets that should not be told
And you should not be so bold who are you to judge how they roll
It's a cold world yes indeed but into achieving your dreams then how can you regret what you seen
Talk to much a reason 8 reside ways 8 times
See to the lightest how long it takes me
I suggest you leave hip-hop alone for your own sake these 10,000 bars is crazy
Too few nights a sacrifice things like no sleep
He doesn't exaggerate he claims he was the first rapper in space
Ain't scared to say Rip The Jacker to your face
He was trusted but Betrayed his name led him to his grave
But not before he conquered his rage what a marvelous day gardening parsing in the shade quite a change from his militant ways
He said one reckless action can pierce life's Swartz but
The tongue of the wise will bring healing from the wars
No matter where you go there you are standing before God what does this have to do with a job
IRA 41K I need the pay right away go way
Silence the sade no escape for the slave
Trying to run us like jogging in place
The Gulags Are not very far away
Pompeii 7 kilometers going the wrong way
Motherfuckers we read GPS wrong all day
Meditate in a Time Machine
Mix back-and-forth with a laser beam
Clean like weapons you can beat
I concentrate everybody dreams by using a touchscreen
Billion souls trapped between The American dream
The supreme being talks to this new in Cheba to walk between the shrubs and trees supreme cause from the unseen
By a prophet a mustabeen I see project through being of the hip hop machine
Understand what I mean a bunch of fake [ ] trying to create story board scenes
I will be redeemed as odd as it may seem
I need data pass theme helicopter news team try to scream
Lighting bolts stream from the heat by the beach
I transform into a beast with wide teeth tap that see
So why speak symptoms last for weeks
The best emcee in the world complex quoted
That that **** is ill we globally about to preach
With a poetic masterpiece whenever the horns blow Street sweeper from the beast from the east
From the death we are sworn to protect
Hip-hop is eternal we gotta live it till the end my friend
But I must rescind I gotta murder to attend [  ]
Please be my guest die the Jacker the head bit of sweat Buddha Allah Yahweh God Lord Jesus fiscal cheba
Armed a stealth pierces the cloud seconds
Later it's followed by a sun the war starts now
Conventional or synthetic cooper Nick Acetal
Titanium exterior shields and edges yeah
I'll have a pump a nickel wheat with extra pepper
Sinuses is acting up it must be the weather
Strategic effect the flight path CIA staff got some pretty ass [ ] they be such a tight ass what's your profession poet laureate
Sin temp 7 I converted infinity into a weapon
Shouted stop complaining shut up unless you gotta solution we looking at em like what do we do sir he said nothing
Then lowered his head then said everything Will fix itself in the end
Syllables deeply known globally upholding the hip hop rosary
Notably greatest mix of all time supposedly
Murder the Jacker urgently observe me perform surgery
The mixing board comfortably sent the Jacket to the cemetery
Snake Easter connect rhymes surprise many ciniary vocabulary extraordinary galactic emissary depreciation Preliminary greed vocation cosmonaut to communication through a constellation of a celestial equation
And updated with stimulate peace co 11 electric information electro cranium completely awesome ramification
Fuck supernatural fall all over creation
Creativity from the sky originate from high forces
Smoke dime onic chronic
The aura despise the forces
The corps Sport's in armor to draw flying source
It enlightens the brother
Engage in battle with satan's monsters bathed in heaven water Been Allen belt holds up my boxers forever
And you mother fucking bastards don't believe NASA
They just meaningless Batwas
Don't believe contractor with a asassala answers propa
The public propaganda
I am a terabeam command the fuck smell the gunpowder
Right from the Inrange spinda
The Dillinger the piece of cylinder
Move by motor the soul crush supernova
We underground Warriors
The shoulder I shoot with is separated stupid you think
You got a better shot than me then do it now you got the juice stop the music silence I want you to hear what the truth is I
Wanna see humankind rise I wanna see it with my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop
I want aliens to listen to hip-hop haters misquote rhymes brought turpentine down the throats let them choke with the bamboo vine
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies screen casualty count between him and spyStone they going to carry you out
No doubt overhead a wax wipe
The whole place off the map no excessive force just rap
What kind of life you got it
You see me here rhyming with this robot
You know a brother love hip-hop
Love overboard chopped it with a high winter fog
Probably never make it back to shore
The worlds crowded but I feel alone
I'm always be there for you turn to you now you on your own
A life of service nowhere near a politician perfect
I'm glad your wife is a strong person I'm a forget you
But not if you special
Especially if indiscriminately unsettled
Wherever you at that's what you settled
Public program policy pussy
The pedal metaphors melt metal morphed into something that can be used by rebels
Corporate Devils wish a jaw Briggs fuck you you are all dead man walking talking bout you awesome terabytes you lyrics
Shadow bites the spirits
Some criticize it some like to hear it regulatory
Tell em the story  do you have the right to remain silent sorry I'm sorry please stop talking strength and vitality
The Arawak Indians dance for me because I commanded it to be
I pluck triggers like ukaladies with the strings missing
Wasn't ever into no vague kissing
Biological rhythms always watching the bottom of women
My hair on the cleopatras my kitten
When the invitation is given do not go
The hair and nails of the undead do not grow
I ain't got enough teeth to properly eat meat
I can't barbecue cause property ain't cheap construction cost per square foot either we got to stay put
Or we got a fine somewhere eels to cook when I'm satisfied
I'll deliver take the arrow out of the quiver RTR said battle me
**** x-ray vision night goggle rip a block to good for Twitter while I harness horn da Vengeance for biohazard contingence
All living organic conditions maybe this'll put your sentence back in remission
Spitting so much things we don't know taking place
But dey taking care of everything every day
Liar birds mimic my voice The hardest thing to avoid
Turns out to be the simplest choice
I'm the Deepwater dread till you get it through your motherfucking head
One day you'll remember what I said
What happens when 7 Billion minds couldn't Match the mind of one cause
Shan so'd the wars coming from the sun composition
None of your business so what are you thinking
I'm thinking he's gifted he should be on the urgent care
And supervision is there
Anything he said or anything written he said these 10,000 bars were brilliant
Shan51 flying around in the talphasphere
Shan51 back spitta like molecule yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012 Shan 50 the light bearer the rhyme with devine layers x2
Jackers better say they prayers
Rip The Jacker 2 infinity is here
Padlock your chances you're not prepared everybody scared
I battled emcees for 10 years they fear when I bus
Poem sparks a fierce Roebuck several miles deep underneath
The earth shan51 visionary the math design a magnificent verse in 2012
I passed the phase the telepathic ability birth ripple net worth all work peered deep in here herc
Completely and strong stem my work call God curse
Colder than a heart of a murk
Close like a label less childbirth
It takes place below the dirt
The key makes a turn let it be turned
A new man emerge badly burned smells like a bag of herb vision is getting blurred
A sound scientifically superb every verse is well heard
Perform a cappella surgery you rep TV surf sand
50 won't you murder me hip box will chase you through the turf
Shan51 flying around in the talphasphere
Shan51 back spitta like molecule yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan 50 the light bearer the rhyme with devine layers
Fly Robin fly so you can get shot out the sky that's a copout Nice try 10,000 bars that means I'm a part of rap music forever but I don't know if I want that pressure
That's why I built a robot to live out the legacy
Rip the robot is the best MC
My condense stealth detention is nothing RTR is under construction
I can't wait till RTJ press the button like inspected gun shit zone dumping maintained in a holding pattern Altitude above cloud cover rain all the way out to Pluto and back again
And by the time this gets back rap won't exist it
I'll have to be rediscover the history of it is not very uncovered
J to the blue-collar puppet excepted applauded reward it at sun down
Soup will be snorted unless the blood of lamb mixer offer
We do not to negotiate with any enemy elements
Dragon snake people rat donkey or elephant Music for the meditated therapist they call me a heretic
But poet laureate never quit it's been saved
Yeah I'll battle you and reinvest the finance Capital
And build a robot to out rap you
Now that's what I call of real rap star
Six point facemask of the Jaguar
Shan51 keep flying around in the talphasphere
Shan51 back spitta like molecule yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan 50 the light bearer the rhyme with devine layers
