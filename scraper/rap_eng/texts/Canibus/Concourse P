[Intro: Pete Rock]
Damn man, shit, nigga I wrote this shit
Fuck y’all niggas talkin’ bout?
P. Rock, niggas, get that
Real Hip-Hop, what it do son
No doubt, yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Pete Rock]
Pete Rock, the desperado
Used to push the hard-top Milano, keep a trunk full of vinyl
Now it’s all about Serato, scratch box, laptop
7:45, knock the camera on [?] (Whoo!)
Speak in tongues, nah Papo
But I’m worldwide though, Paris, Tokyo, Bosno
Switzerland, with my mans and them
Italiano show respect like my last name Soprano
Another day another dollar bill, I’ma keep it real
Give a crap how y’all cowards feel
Goin’ to the house for the points, I just landed it
The Boy Wonder for Pres, the hood candidate
You wonder why these haters wanna check my manuscript?
Legit talent on display, I illegitimate
This is what I represent, that full throttle, hard body like a militant
And y’all hollow like tips on a silver bullet
Y’all won’t pull it, got enough wangstas frontin’
Straight stuntin’ like Kay Slay, R.I.P. to my man [?]
You know we miss you and Dilla, everyday
No doubt that I’m a Mac with the wordplay
But everybody got opinions like a vertebrae
Address you niggas in a speech here’s what I would say
“To all you rappers, eat a dick and have a nice day”

[Hook x2: Canibus]
This is Concourse P, welcome to Concourse P
This is Concourse P, boarding now, this is Concourse P

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Concourse P, please provide essential ID
Take a seat, bout to fly like like geese
Pete Rock Concourse P, provide your essential ID
Climb aboard if you vaporizer free
Crates of hardware, the acetate bombardier
Is in skippers chair visibility clear
Retract the landing gear, this is Pete Rock Pan Air
Canibus fanfare I'ma tell you when we land there
Soul Brother number one, Samsung we bang drum
From every corner of the Earth to Seoul South Korea son
I just taught my Saudi Arabian butterfly
How to drive in a right hand side M5
Horsepower impressive C02 sensors
Cost, labor intensive, valuable, expensive
Moose Jaw Wyoming, we left Jackson hole blown wide open
We left the mixing board sliders broken
Who can you handle it? The largest vinyl collection on the planet sonically sample it, electronically scan it and stamp it
Light up cigars dancing, passing out pamphlets
The Great Pete Rock, Bronze Nazareth & Canibus
Concourse P, Champagne glass in the air
Propose a toast to a long career
When it's all said and done I got memories
I rocked with the best beat architects of the 21st century
Pick a date - pick any piece of acetate
Then watch Pete pick a gold plate out the crate
Transform Serato to Murcielago
DJ Mia Moretti & Catlin Moe fast and furious
Go fast or slow, Virtuoso Canibus flow
Listen up - this is your captain speaking asshole
Put ya' tray tables away turn off your radios
Seat backs full upright follow the flight plan yo'
Put ya' mouth between ya' legs - kiss your ass goodbye
Thank you for flying the skies where the phoenix rise
Put ya' mouth between ya' legs - kiss your ass goodbye
And thank you for flying the skies where the phoenix rise

[Hook: Canibus]
