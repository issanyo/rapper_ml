[Intro]
Ha, yo
They're storming the place, yo
Yea, The Mandlebrot Set: Type II
Rare Kommidity on the beat
Check it
You ever had that feeling they're closing in on you?
These fucking beasts?
Yo, look

[Verse 1: Greydon]
Hot shit, pop shit, get dropped quick by a drop kick
When I don’t have music I’m toxic and obnoxious
In a mosh pit and locked in with 6 blankas
Fireballs charged and launching
Rhyme from Long Island to Compton
Someone falls I’m an accomplice
Can-I-Sheng Long trained him monster
Better go back and check the responses
I ain't the one you want to spar with
My main weapon’s locked on your starship
Head back to the starport
The local starbase you came from and park it
Look, I'm the only true apprentice they should mention in the same sentence
All others should get a faint mention
What a strange vision of us in a game that ended
While you think its just the same but different
I'm ashamed of the lyrical laziness that these lames’ll kick with
When we try to frame angles and distance

[Chorus]
6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face

6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face

[Verse 2: C Gats]
Sharp sword, swingin' swift, my syllabus strikes
More hardcore than the force of a venomous bite
From anaconda sick flows, crescendos are mental
I vent through heavy instrumentals to avenge loops
Offend you? I meant to settle this with a pen swoop
Titanium? Forget you, bring heavier metal, dent you
Timed white dwarfs dispersed, ignite universe
Collide, bright bursts, diverse we write super earths
Despite the core's gravity pull we fight faster
With lines at light speed to-wards the worlds atmos'
-Phere as we peer beyond rap Galactus
We fear nothing clastic, eat worlds, you're fastin'
Titanic, I bite granite, design planets and stars
My bars atomic, rhymes  are glow in the dark
So if they say the scheme is mean and a product of radiation
If there ain't a GU logo on it it's a farse, nigga

[Chorus]
6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face

6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Sit back watch the 12 foot [?]
Full bench-press a chin-up chopper
Majestic mic Mandelbrot with Croc sandals up in the spot
Heat-sinked slots keep him cool when they get hot
Commercial grade fire and burn-proof
Hard to get a nigga out the loop like a tree with strong roots
Prosthetic four-arm attachment
Skin-grafted the ratchets for quick access, blast that bitch
Attack great cross-section in cast fate
Get back to base 'fore you take that fricking mask off your face
Pushups 280, if not you'll be pushing up daisies
I love it when recruits say, "Make me"
Boots on the ground, rocket nukes lost in the clouds
Your pro mask is as good as a wet towel
The straw that broke the camel's back to trade the Devil's plan of attack
You poisoned purified water in my camelback
Ten minutes after that the whole brigade collapsed
Every day we get a dozen distractions
The spit fire, fire spit flying-wing four-armed [?]
Proof of my superior messiahship
What is a Mandelbrot? A mind-numbing paradox
With mental, spiritual, and physical shacklelocks
Greydon the juggernaut, Canibus the dragon from Camelot
Majestic mic master Mandelbrot

[Chorus]
6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face

6 blankas dispatched in armor sent in to calm us
Is the encore, get on the goddamn floor
So yells the law enforcement
Apes, chimps, and simians of all sorts’es
All force us to face
