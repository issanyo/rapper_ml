Call Me (From Louisville)
Jonathan Hay feat Canibus and Chaz Ultra

[Chorus: Chaz Ultra]

I need to talk but I'll wait to call you
I make the wrong move tonight
I felt so awful, I wait to call you
I wake-up all through the night

[Verse 1: Canibus]

DÃ©colletage, this big titty broad got me hard
She make me stand in attention like the honor god
Groupie or goddess, pretty boobies come in all sizes
I prefer a big onion to be honest
Im an EOD crabmaster grab asser
Turbo charged long hair lathed in red baron
Im a red handed auto mechanic
She came through in spandex to get rotated and balanced
I landed the fixed wing in the cariot, picked her up in my chariot
One day the Brigit Helms will marry her
One hundred for chops, turbulence, ten foot drops
Captain is breathing through a black vapor box
Cantoon the chicken and spams, spaghetti sauce and ham
Yeah thats what I call romance
She gots consciousness, sentience, sapience and inner radiance
She turned out to become my biggest inspiration yet

[Chorus: Repeat]

[Verse 2: Canibus]

Having said all that, let me say this
If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be shit
So don't diss the program
Get on your knees and kiss the toe jam
The wind is a whisper, hip-hop is my sister
I'll told her I missed her while she went Hollywood and dissed her
She's a lipstick, mystic, a swift and gifted music critic
Who's gets lifted and starts talking cryptic
Sexy Pamela Hensley looking all baffled and friendly
I broke out because I didn't want her to tempt me
Electric pearls, so much more than just a girl
She's the gravity of my world

[Chorus: Repeat]

[Bridge: Audio Stepchild]

I like the way you move me, I'm your groupie
(Get your groupie ass out my hotel room)
Baby I know just how to please a man
(Okay come up here)
