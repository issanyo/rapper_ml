This for you girl, you know I love you
Baby

[Hook 2X: Canibus]
I'm so into you
I wanna do so many things to you
I can't talk without mentionin you
And let me tell you what I think of you

[Canibus]
Yeah, my name is, none of your business, let me tell you why I love her
She hot when she in front but she stand behind a brother
She wiggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I might wanna get into
I always empower her, tell her that I'm proud of her
Show her I don't wanna make no housewife outta her
Sprinkle her with compliments, but I never shower her
That's the last thing I would do, cause I value love
She give me ounces of love, let me bounce the bum
And when she call my name, I come/cum
If I front she raise up, we fuss fight and break up
Then wake up in the Bahamas after we done made up
She know my psychological make-up
I'm therapeutic with the broad, we keep it raw when we make love
And can't nothin change the trust we have
Wherever we are, we think about the moments and laugh, because

[Hook]

[Canibus]
When I was on tour, I held the elevator for this broad in the lobby
Seen her later on in the bar, she sat beside me
Said the guy at the front desk recognized me
And told her all about me...
She said I heard you're a rapper, career in the crapper
I know you want some ass, you probably won't give no cash up
You should fill my glass up, tell me 'bout your bad luck
And if I feel sorry enough, I'll give you the sad fuck
I had to laugh, put my hand on my gut
I told her I'd let her have the next grand that I touched
Walked back to the elevator with my hand on her butt
To the bed with the camera in front (MONEY SHOT) cut!
I hopped up and blazed one
Yo the room and tax is paid hun, stay as long as you want
I'll be back in a hour, she said that's what they all say
I know ma, I've been sayin that all day

[Hook]

[Canibus]
The valet don't remember nothin, he didn't leave the engine runnin
I jump in, don't bless him with nothin
Call up this other ma, she remember I'm comin
I told her I'ma cook, but I'ma just pick up somethin
The fireplace runnin, she layin on her stomach
Nasty english all in her muffin, she love it
She giggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I'ma get into again
I told her I don't really like to come through her block
Cause the blueberry drop attract too many cops
Girls hop in the drop, take off they top, my belt buckle pop
They know that I'm hot, can't tell me I'm not
They surrounded the car, six cops
I was holdin up traffic for six blocks, they put me in the shitbox
Look at you now, I can't even come through your spot
And it's messin with my mind, cause I loved you a lot

[Hook]
