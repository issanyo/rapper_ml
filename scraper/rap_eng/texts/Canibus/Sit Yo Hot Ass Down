Weed-vapour move through a six-figure vacuum-tube
I magnetically attract the Moon
My blood was tested, they cloned my genetics
The Chief Medic was Dr. Henry Merrick
Vascular endothelial recombination
In other words, I'm saying, regeneration
Chromonal-mass injection from Germaine Jetson
Boots, spurs and Stetson, sidearm weapon
Federale Mexicans standing right next to him
Take you back to the Trauma Unit for questioning
Talk to the Texans about the next Middle East insurrection
In the _____________

(Canibus)
It's the counter-attack for the mountain cat that pounced on your back over here, let me show you on the mats
Wrap a nigga up like a boa on a shoulder
Take a picture with me, look brave for the photo
They kill you in the prison-yard talking about life on Mars
Don't nobody want to fight that war
My train of thought can maim a horse
With the ease that a crane lift a grain of salt

(Canibus)
Yeah
What they call large, we call petite
What we call the street needs what they call a G
The off-road freaks with Boss Hog teeth
I met a bitch called Daisy in Long Beach
International Recon agreed to meet us at dawn
Now the whole fucking beach is gone
We're fucking remarkable, don't try to make us marketable
We don't even want to talk to you

(Canibus)
Yeah, I drugged you, mugged you, take everything from you
To bring you back morally humble cause I love you
Boulder, Colorado Gestapo crawling out of foxholes
Listening to Rock & Roll

(Canibus)
Lock and load, niggas say, "How Solo's stock just grow?"
I say, "Look, it's not just flows"
So *when you hear the sound prepare for the rounds*
Trauma Unit, Sit Yo Hot Ass Down, nigga
