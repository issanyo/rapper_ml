[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo what up?
Stop parking your rollers on the side of the street homey
This is fucking Chef, man
This your brother Chef, man
From Shaoland
You already know it's Shaolin, what going on?

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Back for vengeance, glocked up, drinking CÃ®roc up
Call it what you call it, I'ma call it some block stuff
Used to flashing gats, double barrels that flips narrow
Don't even give it to Daryl then
Hang with the monster mobsters
All of them keep rockets on 'em, ain't no sense for the arguments
Drugs and guns and dunns in every part of my plan's done
Hiding in my mansion, one year
I'm a Polo head, Polo with a Rover sober red
Riding with my niggas in Chicago, hold the lead my nigga
'Cause it's the bigger we get, the bigger you fall
The bigger we shit, check the wall full of scholars
Bank robbers ankle gold joggers
All my niggas quick to get off, popping collars, kid
It's just a family status
Don't get sprayed up for fucking with the family cabbage

[Hook: Bronze Nazareth]
Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
He must be on meds and shit
I keeps one of those things that shreds your shit
Or did he forget the number of how many get hit?
For fuckin' with real niggas, more money to get
Fuck it, sandblast niggas like the Mojave
Beast Mugabi, I'll be probably oddly
Pushing down the street low key bucket and banger
Front liners with me strictly, buckin' and bangin'
Twisting the robbery on missions soldiers
Goblins know got steam brewing niggas like Folgers
Fronkenstein, I'ma bubble away
From tripling what a nigga made yesterday
Before I start bustin' a musket, ivory tusk handle on the hammer
Trust me it must be Pentagon or nothing, motherfucker
I won't tell you again
Sand rider, Samurider, I'ma ride till the end

[Hook: Bronze Nazareth]
Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Women are for fucking, men are for fighting
Who cares, as long as they both bend over smiling?
Yo, I get muddy like Volkswagon off road buggy
Ladies love me, teddy bears and puppies
Poisonous insects and animals in the stash house
Looking for cash, don't put ya hand in the couch
Frodo Baggins escort the Komodo dragon
Repeat rapid, memorize the God's solo classics
Predator prowler truth to power gunpowder
Plaid lumberjack flak jackets and cowboy trousers
Ponderosa Ibuprofen, gasoline soaked Mimosas
Ocean Spray Grey Goose dolphins
Charles Bronson Godzilla Gulf of Tonkin
Sponsored by the Luxor the casino comped him
The Rat Hunters cut his dick off last summer
Flushed it down the toilet, send it back to his mother, motherfucker

[Hook: Bronze Nazareth]
Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke

[Verse 4: Craig G]
Heartless, like war torn soldiers in Bosnia
I was with his girl yesterday, ain't have to Bill Cosby her
Craig G, Can-I-Bus, Rae, Kurupt
Antiseptic on beats, you ain't low spray your guts
What? Cover it up with a Band Aid
Damn straight you'll never come close when we mandate
These verbal executions, fitting MCs necks for nooses
Catch him as he cops a few looses
I literally and figuratively shoot fifths
True shit, a way to lose quick
Is to cross me, leave a body cold in these warm streets
Hop off stage, punch him in the face, hop back on beat
Hold New York, 42nd Street was for dope fiends
Triple feature kung fu flicks and other coke schemes
Orange boxcutters and cut off his feet sleeks
It's different now, it's easy to act tough from a safe place

[Hook: Bronze Nazareth]
Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke
