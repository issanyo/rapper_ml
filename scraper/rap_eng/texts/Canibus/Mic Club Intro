[Intro: Canibus]
Hahahahaha

[Verse: Canibus]
Enter the Mic Club, this is where it all starts
MCs defend their honor at all costs
Cycle of winners, this ain't for beginners
Front and centre, state your name and your business
When I pass you the mic, you better burn it
Don't be squirmish, you want respect? You've gotta earn it
This is where we define purpose
How much heart lies beneath the surface?
What's hidden behind the curtain?
Besides tight verses, nothing in life is certain
If you live as long as your words, you make life worth it
Writing rhymes give me a buzz, I do this for the love
Welcome to the M-I-C Club
