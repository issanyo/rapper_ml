Intro
This heavy metal sound that you’re hear is
The sound is deafening here in the arena so I won’t try to yell over it
All I can say is
The heavyweight champion is about to make his appearance in the ring
Every once in the while you hear the clinging of chains
Everything is intimidating

Verse 1 (Rock Mecca):
When it comes to moving crowds there’s none higher than gunfire
You stood behind the one who caught it like Umpire
That’s all it took for you pagans to become pious
Don’t try us, all my challengers end up in one pyre
Dumb rappers wanna battle but they won't find us
Come fight us
In the underworld amongst the unbiased
Criminal how these rappers wanna talk violence
Some lyin
Call authorities to come and untie em
I came up without a silver spoon
Just to make moves
Had to connect with unsavory dudes
Who never paid dues
It ended with a knife in my back
A fork in the road
I’m vowing that I’d never go back
I went from barely surviving to rising to thriving
To arriving to the status of a tyrant
Who rules the population with the wisdom of osiris
And crushes opposition with infinite clips of iron

HOOK:

Ayo
We live for it
Die for it
Some of us’ll kill for it
Lie for it
Round the clock
Planning and plot
To climb your way to the top
We ridin…
On the count of three
Here we go now…
Ready or not
Your journey’ll stop
Through various blocks
With flurries of shots
And burial plots
Expect no help and no pardon
No mercy, no pity

VERSE 2 (Rock Mecca)

I’m rolling up in a tank
I pull up next to the bank
I’m crushing cars when I park
My surfboard is a shark
The turf wars that I start
Could plunge the earth into darkness
I’m Spartacus, march
Like Hannibal out in Carthage
My office hours is 9 to 5
You’ve been notified
Unless you wanna go take a dive
Like Big Red, control your last five heartbeats
When I stick my fingers through your chest
And clutch your arteries
For these diaries
I’ll tell you what I’m using, but I’m warning ya
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
16 bars of Sodium Thiopenthal
The flow is breathtaking when traveling through your mental
Another sixteen of Pancurionium Bromide
To back down the muscle in your squad who wanna go ride
Potassium Chloride, for anyone left with heart to question
My lyrical text is, Lethal injection

(REPEAT HOOK)

Verse 3: (Canibus)
I will hang your heads from a bayonette’s edge
You ain’t even dead you smell like rotten eggs
Bear hug the gun barrel
Drain blood from your bone marrow
Shoot your ass out the saddle
Run you over with galloping cattle
Battle for a high stakes raffle
On the drawbridge of Aberdeen castle
One degree above absolute zero
I’m a bad bandelero
Open the Stargate for the pharaoh
Bony or frail
Bruce Lee with a ponytail
King R Cons bail bonds was hell
Fallen angel talk like Gabriel
The lion’s share of the planet is dead
No matter what I say to you
Darkness absorbs light
And all probiotic life
I wipe honey on my dinosaur bites
To get back in the fight
It’s war-like how we torture the mic
I was born a fortnight before Christ

(REPEAT HOOK)

VERSE 4 - CANIBUS

No pity
Spit with me
Walking through the whole 360
Man look at what we did to this beat
Rock Mecca quote the eighteenth letter
Seventeen in the Beretta
F16’s cool, F15’s better
Fourteen radar cross sections
Thirteen dimensions
Twelve months later
Eleven-Eleven
10-4
Nine Eleven, no question
Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four
Three, Two, One
Hell bent on weapons
Mecca
