[Hook]
Goodnight… don't laugh don't cry
I'll never leave you
So just close your eyes
Couldn't deceive you
So fall deep into sleep to my lullaby

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I recorded this in solitude
Probably the only opportune moment to talk to you
I'ma hold hands and walk with you, all of you
I honor you plus I got a lot of jewels to offer you
I know each of you got jewels to offer too
But only if the world knew what was possible
The gods and the goddesses above they watch us
While fallen angels make obstacles to stop us
Fear shuts down the evolution process
Chaos, that's what they want to accomplish
They usher in law and order through the back door
Start a massive war, enact martial law
Nah, the real samurai stand up
Atomic Godzilla just fucked Japan up
Think about it, they say Haiti had bad luck
I say, “Man up, their leaders just abandon them”
What happened to the donation relief dollars?
I'll tell what happened, it went to them leader's pockets
They use fear and confusion to control us
Tell us to donate then rob us for our emotions
They pretend to lead the people like Moses
As the Rapture approaches they escape in the commotion
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They believe in me too, so I ain't gonna leave you

[Hook]

[Canibus] (Overlaps Chorus)
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I came to tell you that the Elohim believe in you
And the righteous never have a right to deceive you
You've never seen me do nothing greedy or unreasonable
And that's cause I ain't ever gon' leave you
Canibus was put here to ride with you
And build our faith up to fight the impossible
I ain't preaching brother, I'm saying all we got is each other
Forget what those motherfuckers promised you
I love you and I honor you
The God honest truth is that I would do the same thing if I was you
Comet 911 is coming nobody saying nothing
But we gotta figure out what to do

[Hook]

[Canibus] (Overlaps Chorus)
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people

[Outro: Canibus]
Chaos, death, and destruction is near
I pray these words don't fall on deaf ears
Comet 911 is almost here
Do the research and find out for yourself
Stop waiting on somebody else to help
Be proactive, save yourself
