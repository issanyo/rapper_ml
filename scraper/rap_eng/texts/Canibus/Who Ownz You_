Yo...I thug it wit' you, I slug it wit' you
I had niggas runnin' around like ''yeah 'Bis brung it to you''
Nigga I'll punish you, catch you in the street like what's the issue
Monkey face I'll monkey flip you
I always wanted to diss you
You ugly as a pit bull motherfucker, I'll rip you
This is where the Broad St. bullyin' stops
My bars of gold bullyin' yours are not
Truth is I never thought your metaphors were hot
You just talk a lot a shit cause you're on the Roc'
There's no proof in your ''Truth'' it was a flop
That's why Jigga signed Cam'ron to take your spot
You think you hot cuz you got a little bling or what not
A typical hustler all you do is think about rocks
With a budget like yours you should a sold more
You probably think you recouped nigga you're so wrong
I think Jay fucked you go look at your deal
In that black mink you look like a ape for real
If I was blind and I couldn't tell
I'll probably still hear it from a bitch that you ugly as hell
For starters the Bentley ain't yours it's Shawn Carter's
And if it ain't Shawn's, it's his partners
You're just another novice artist with frog lips
On the Roc-A-Fella roster that follows orders, nigga!
You tryin' too much you lyin' to sluts
You too hyped up, spend some more time in the cut
I'll turn my voice up loud so I can tell you wassup
Rhyme for rhyme you was never ready for 'Bus
Your quotables are anecdotal
Your whole crew's softer than tofu
Most of y'all don't even know the ''Truth''
If you did then you knew I was a soldier too
Doing what you already sold your souls to do
I'm doing shows and my wrist stays frozen too
But I own my shit who owns you?
I should sign to the Roc'
Battle you in the lobby of Worldwide Plaza make you resign on the spot
Give me that mic' back Mack Bitch you can't spit
I don't even know why the fuck Jigga passed you that shit
I'll embarrass you with that shit, blast you that quick
Wrap you in plastic and toe-tag you as a Jacker
