[Verse 1]
The biggest blessings when the younger look out for the older
The older providing the shoulder to bolster the culture
We were just Ewok soldiers facing off much larger opponents
Stronger than ogres, mutated poisonous cobras
Media moguls with teeth like marsupial rodents
Sacha Baron Cohen open mic moments
Ask what you like, questions are loaded
You're likely to be misquoted, end up like Alex Jones did
In no time, culture vultures pick your bones by the roadside
As we inhale the potassium bromide
From 50 Shades of grey colored skies, demonetized by Russian spies
Why does a brother even try?
Go underground just to survive, above ground, nothing but lies
Paralyzed by the drugs they provide
Tranquilizer for the mind, available online
I declined, but that's why we need more time

[Verse 2]
There is no more time, depends on which clock you go by
Blow the chofar, pray to the rain god
What if we're not on the same side, but we came from the same tribe?
I don't know how to answer this guy
This old goon on iTunes, did you sign to him?
Did you give away your lies to him?
What about YouTube? I watched the reaction from TwoDudes
Straight through hypnotized by the lights in the room
Analytic brain food, Professor Griff type jewels
The creator gives you the right to choose
It feels like we fighting to lose when we don't know which narrative's true
But what the Khazarian crackers do?
What about devils with the blackest hue? Sell your black ass out, too
The root of evil captures every group
The number four jump traps snap loose
Break your spine and your back, too, just give me a beat I can rap to

[Verse 3]
Germaine and TwoDudesFromMaine talk about coons in the game
Who don't love hip-hop the same
The question is never satisfied, answers must be properly ratified
Find out how to resist and try
Sophia Stewart envisioned human androids dressed like druids
I wish I had the resources to prove it
Black lithium red mercury, alert orange level emergency
Poetry was never perjury
Then it occurred to me, if they can shut Alex Jones down
They can censor every poet in the whole world now
You ask how? Natives are restless, fatigues make behavior aggressive
A positive message is labor intensive
I been in the club with Puff, I watched Donald Trump walk up
Elbows rub, Cristal in the cup
All I'm saying is before the oval office even mattered
He was cool with rappers and I don't think he was actin'
