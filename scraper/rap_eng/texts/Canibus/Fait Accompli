[Verse 1: Canibus]
Type on keyboard blind, sign in, everybody say, "Hi"
I'm the holy Hip Hop magi
Them motherfuckers kicked down the door, I got excited
When I realized who it was I got silent
Morgan Freeman told the country it's all over
Danny Glover said the same thing but slower
Now they say he's worse than Carter
Him and his big head daughters
They don't care collapse of the dollar
The population of a planet cries out for more
They are ignored and repeatedly provoked to war
Martial Law, what you think they was hoping for?
All you gotta do is walk through that open door
Modern man is but a primitive hologram
Transhuman's revolutions with pots and pans
The god gene is the dominant strand
The politics don't matter, the left, right or the communist plans

[Verse 2: Canibus]
If you don't want beef, pipe down that inflammatory speech
Throw you in the Goulag for weeks
Which Pussy Riot whore got a passport to go to Hong Kong?
Nah nigga you ain't going on tour
The hood die young with guns and tied tongues
Daughters and sons smoke drugs that fry lungs
When liars tell the truth, nobody believes them
Then along comes somebody they can trust that deceives them
One ounce of silver, one once of copper
That's all I got, that ain't enough to stop 'em
The problem that we face is race
Even if you ain't black, you can't escape this draconian fate
Partnership, transpacific, free speech no longer permitted
Guilty as charged, you will not be acquitted
Listen, you taking a piss? You better not be
You on the black list, everybody 'bout to get stripped
Yeah, you know what they say, it is what it is till it ain't
So what, you go hard in the paint
Whatever, hurry up and wait till it's too late to change the stakes
The nuisance abates, the truth is you're abused by the state
Get small, stay home and pray
Raytheon drones strafe, no home is safe
Don't watch the throne, watch that Nordics face
Iditarod dog race across unthawed straights
For the agent provocateur in all lace
Muscle therapy Kate, Uleander in a sauna feeding me grapes
She pour cold champagne in the warm spring lake
Brought her to my seed vault for the cost of freight
"Svalbard" how's it feel to rule the world? Wait!
I got one kernel of corn on my plate
Stop dreaming get back to base
Well OK, but why the flight time shorter than the pat downs take?
It's because freedom is fake in a police state
USA constitution got shredded in '08
Able bodied adults can't get out of the cult
They say it's the Luciferians fault
And now Holocaust healthcare is not much better than welfare
Assassin dress like mailman
Violence doesn't discriminate, it's just has to intimidate
Now you got a Zimmerman in your face
I see the people of the world protest in vain
While the Antichrist reigns through the sons of Cain
Righteous people of the world protest in vain
While the Antichrist reigns, reigns, reigns and reigns
