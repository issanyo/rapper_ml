(Canibus)
High altitude EMP eagle horizon
Hermetic writing, rhymin', vocalin', vibin'
My mothafuckin' words swarm you like hundreds of hummingbirds
With serrated beaks and colored fur
Creations are primal
The Ripper talks to Vishnu and Shiva on top of unidentified Vimana
Nuclear strikes, project blue beam blue light
My straightaway speed is Nitrus oxide on the mic
Barium strikes, green beam sprite
So bright, I lost sight, I'm on a flight to Paraguay the same night
Symphonic, quantum content, cosmic consciousness
Should not continue to be compared to this nonsense
Is lovable but not intense, there's no positive effect
Yeah its colorful, but it's not correct
Complaining is entertaining, Name calling and false naming
All you motherfuckers do the same thing
Til' my bare hands rip out your Pineal glands
Who the fuck tryna' get hyphy with the old man?!
Horsepower at the push of a pedal, black and charred death metal
Dark rays with a gauge through the temple
