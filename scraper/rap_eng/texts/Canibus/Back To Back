Dear god, say it ain't so
Yeah, it's so that's right
Papoose and Canibus collaboration
Yo Canibus set it off man, let's go

[Canibus]
Jesus Christ, my name should be Jeebus Mic
Even when I rip this shit fans leave up tight
Can-I-bus spit is in my blood, I'm blessed
Outside the bones, but inside the flesh
And yes, if I was focused I could crush you
Cuz you sayin you focused, then how come I can still touch you?
I crush you, then spit some young buck shit at you
Cuz I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two

[Papoose]
I could rhyme with the best and the worst of them
From the second to first of em'
All the rest of em', I'm certain
I'm disrespectin them, hurtin them
I'm injectin a verse in them
Mis complexion is worsening
Whats expectin, I'm burnin em'
Take the flesh and the earth of em'
My profession is cursin them
Gettin higher than turbulence
Force bang, soul train
Resurrection and further son
Representin the burnerson
Hit the rest of his nervous men
Brooklyn up, Hook em' up
Disconnected and murdered him

[Canibus]
The perfect music machine, mechanical being
The most lyrical digital stream, the world has ever seen
I did, I do, I does, I am a real B
I was the same nigga you love
But slugs rain from the sky
It's like the angels want me to die
They push me harder cuz they want me to try
A pit bull off the leash, barkin speech
Like a bull in a pit that can't walk or eat

[Papoose]
Tell the king, I'm the castles boss
Keep your eyes on the path you cross
I have you bought, no matter the cash you cost
Run in your bathroom and blast you off
You couldn't stop the lead showers
If you washed with a gat proofed cloth
The mafia be thinkin Black's too soft
That's why I'm quick to catch em' eat spaghetti
Make them bleed ragu sauce
Better pocket the cash you lost
Cuz yo I'll put the infrared to your nose
And have niggas callin you Rudolph

[Canibus]
I feel like the worlds mine, I can park in the street
Kick the worlds illest rhyme, police officers is weak
People layin on concrete exhausted from heat
Watchin John Kerry spit over some Michael Moore beats
This is a lil something that my repertoire boasts
I almost was in control of all coasts
I get a fan, rhymes they quote they all dope
Told them lyrical landslide, gimme all folks

[Papoose]
Street philosophy, I was the first nigga to speak it logically
Keep a policy, bring it out of me
Street's are poverty
Yo I turn you into a vegetable and eat your broccoli for mockin me
After robbin, we repeat the robbery
My life is like a puzzle, don't even think of solvin me
Presidents like democracy, tryna get richer than 3 economies
Calm and collected, if you bring out the other side of me
I'll leave you bodily weak and wobbly

[Canibus]
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
Cuz even though they say my name they ain't talkin to me
They talk to magazines, they talk to mtv
They up in 106 and bet talkin to free
Big niggas actin tough
But they walk like their ankles is cuffed
Who gives a fuck if your ankles is buff?
I could articulate, I want to participate
Cuz you can't hold me back with plaque goin number 8

[Papoose]
These backstabbers tryna bring death to pap
I still got my life, so you got a deathless trap
Mad cuz his pinkie ring in his necklace match
His ring so wide he could put a ref in that
And who said a rapper goin neck to neck with pap
Next time you bobbin to my song, hope your neck jus snap
I eat em' with my wreckless rap
When slay introduce me to rappers he say
Here, this is breakfast pap

[Canibus]
I pick the microphone up and sparked the debate
Ever since 98, I been a target for hate
Jesus Christ, my name should be Jeebus Mic
Even when I rip this shit fans leave up tight
Fuck it I'm in the middle of little Italy
With a middle man that didn't know diddly
So I killed him lyrically
The Big Pun energy enters me, strengthens me
Lay you on the floor shoot you in the back
Make you centipede
My center speed is 10 over 3
MC times kayslay over the mothafukkin mp
My fan base sit and wait for the coming
They couldn't follow the leader long enough so I..

[Papoose]
I bang with a naughty silencer
Assassinatin your corny character
You cop nicks, I got more black then early Africa
Shorty nice, Short hungry, Shorty wildin huh?
Tell that lil bastard I'll feed em' the forty caliber
Your bars is Rikers Island bars, I'm early Attica
Bring it to all these scavengers
I come from the realist city
Where niggas put red bull in they henny
You don't got love for the person you send to stick me
Soon as your man try grip the semi
I'ma hit em' between the "eyes"  like the 'S' in Mississippi
Tot' the pretty semi through any city
I'm really gritty, plus I'm pretty wity
Spit plenty bidney, on plenty hiteys
Spent the pretty penny, on plenty remy
You pity-pity dudes itty bity
I'm illy willy you shitty smitty
Yous a silly billy, smoke plenty phillies
Tot' 50-50's, heard you gon' stick me
Here kitty kitty, come get me get me
Shoot the chitty-chitty bang bang, really through any city
Fuck with many many, men want really I split his kidney
Get insey, don't piss me, hit me, your wrist be shakin risky
Actin frisky, Guinea piggies frisk me you better clip me
I get busy when it come to the flizzey, I get you dizzy
Papoose carry the Milli without Vanilli
