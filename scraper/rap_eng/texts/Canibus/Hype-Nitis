The hype-nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Aiyyo can you feel it?
I know that everyone has heard of that (Vapors)
But this is the '98 version of that
Biz Mark, one of the founders of this art
Discovered evidence of the disease and documented it
Now the name of the virus is called Hype-Nitis
A terminal condition that affects all biters and liars
Hype-naholics can't require my respect
Cause they snakes
And I could smell the venom on their breaths
Hype-Nitis

The hype-nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Alright now, I'ma break the Hype-Nitis down
It's characterized by a certain type of lifestyle
People that treated you foul just wanna be nice now
Smile and raise they eyebrows when you come around
I remember when I first started to work
And tried to get this job as a label intern
Them niggas was killing me, 'cuz wasn't nobody feeling me
A & R's wouldn't even risk demo dealing me

[Hook: Jeni Fujita]
Hype (Can you believe that shit)
Nitis (That's how it was back then)
Is in you eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I know most the niggas I exchange pounds with and lounge with
Wouldn't be around if my career was spiraling downward
They crowd around me til I'm surrounded
Ask me who I'm down with
Til I replied "the Navy SEALS outfit"
They told me my album was coconuts so they rewound it
I knew they was hype-naholics by how they voices sounded
I pulled a silver can out of my trousers
Made a public announcement
About the Hype Juice and then I bounced kid

The Hype-Nitis, is in your eyes

[Verse 4: Canibus]
To me Hype-Nitis is like the measles cause it's a disease too
Studies show it infects one in every five people
It's so lethal the cure can't be achieved hypodermic needles
Or the ingestion of medicine in teaspoons
If you feel the need to
Here's a toll-free number
They'll send you an 8 page pamphlet to read through
800-7932, there'll be available
Hypenoholics standing by for you to speak to

[Hook: Jeni Fujita]
Hype-Nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise
