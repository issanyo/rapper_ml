(Canibus)
Yo. iron Lionheart spit darts
Catch five in the dark, even if my timing is off
The moment of truth, pitch black eyes in the booth
K-Tone, this is for you
The rasta man was shocked Selassie Eye did not have dreadlocks
People cursed and said, "Blood clot"
I roam with the greatest, smoke with the natives
Produce draws I administer to my patients
Word are ancient, timeless statements
Acoustic placement behind rhymes that are ageless
Through acapella arrangement, I achieve theosis
And go wherever I choose to take it
Master of the Matrix. mutilate the music when I say shit
Marginalise everything your brain think
The rhymes way sick
Canibus and Lionhearts slayed it, they say the words were ancient
