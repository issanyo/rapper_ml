[Verse 1:  Canibus]

I stand in the observatory
My staff stands before me with wordless glory, they adore me
Minutes are not recorded
Hours are converted to orbits
With exabyte tape storage
Listen, Canibus one way trip
Mission M16 the Eagle Nebula star system
My rap refracts the rhythm
The beat stays behind this line 'til I give it permission
Forever aesthetic
The credit should go to Henrietta Leavitt
The stars she's measured? Don't forget it
She left me a message
She told me my dark energy was energetic
And I must respect it
She told me the universe was pregnant
And I was the father
Shit, that's a whole lot to swallow
My alien friends
Niobium titanium uranium copper oxide, say it again
MC Mr. C
We know who you reputed to be
Rip get busy how foolish of me
Metaphors by edict leave hip hop speechless
I write it they read it they need it cuz they believe it
My two inch reels are hermetically sealed
In a cabin below New York
Post-war built deep underground military base too
How's a dummy like you ever gonna know the truth?
They asked for proof, Saint Germaine brain
Computer brain analysis get in the proof and produce
Light from within, touch the ring around the firing pin
The universal mind gets wired in
100 grid bed nuclear motors
Weighin' less than 10,000 pounds
Operated by 1000 soldiers
Doors to the memoirs of metaphors
Lead you down the hall that ends at a waterfall
Nobody's been there before
But they would love to be
No video cameras, they would love to see
Just left the confession box my Lord
Excuse you while I go to Hotwhores.org
Sittin there bored
Graveyard shift at the mall
Closed security level four
Hans Blix scripts the "Beast from the East" conflict
Cuz nobody rhymes like this
I spit uranium rich sextagenarian six six
My cranium is an aquarium with fish
Combat risk scale of one to 10, a 6
My compact disk make your compact glitch
If you only have one wish
Speak it, but first believe it
It's called metaphors by edict


[Sample:    In the golden era of course you wanted to make money but you really wanted to be the best, make the best track...And that's what really...I think that that interview comes through, musically, striving to make great art.  And I don't think hip hop is generally looked at that way (Woman: as art?), as art, artists striving to make the best art that they can, the best music that they can.]
