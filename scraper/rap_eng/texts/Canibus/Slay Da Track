(Canibus)
It's Canibus nigga, five years later damaging niggas
Cancelling niggas, paramedics is bandaging niggas
I'm tired of pampering niggas, I'm an animal nigga
Get the Desert Eagle and just start hammering niggas
I should take a field trip and go camping with niggas
Turn into Charles Manson and start strangling niggas
Talk about the Blair witch and start amping the niggas
Then get it on camera while the bears mangling niggas
Stand back talking shit like it's none of my business
You didn't listen, now you got a head full of stitches
I'm an animal nigga, micro organisms swim in my saliva
Because I drink river aqua, I'm a survivor
So give thanks to the father, like the Rastas
‘Cause I believe in karma, beat you down like the brown bomber
While you scream out in horror, these people came to see a fight, not an opera
Now you got no honor, you got dropped by your record label and your sponsors
But you still go up to the office, and pretend you're on the roster
Like you're working on another project, I think you lost it
Psychological hardship, plus the new gossip
Is you homo and you swallow dick
You used to date nothing but model chicks, but you came out the closet
Now you're dealing with the problems and the politics
You the opposite of what I am
Give a pound to yourself cause I ain't shaking your hand
I'ma grown man trying to get gold by the grand
You in a wasteland pacing back and forth in the sand
That's why they hate the Canibus man, I'm better than them
In a minute I'ma be getting more cheddar than them
I'm more independent than them
So I don't care if the pothole dented my rims, I rented the Benz
The only thing I give a fuck about is lead in my pen
I'm on a higher level than them
I didn't have to sell my soul to the devil to win
The only thing I pawned is a watch, bezel the rim
Sip a cold mineral drink, smoke a couple nickels and think
What's the next move a nigga should make
Maybe I should invest in some stocks and bonds
Drive out to Vegas and stick my cock in a few broads
Princesses tongue kiss frogs
On the West Coast you can do whatever the fuck you want
That's why I moved out there, ‘cause it's cool out there
My crews out there, watch what I'ma do out there
I'ma wreck shit, Can-I-Bus will bless shit
My tongue's reckless, check the press kit
Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted
Canibus is known for spitting that ill shit
Motha fuckers
