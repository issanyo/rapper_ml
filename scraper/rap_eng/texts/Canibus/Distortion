[Intro]
"Brace yourself, what you're about to experience is turned upside down"

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Distortion, my brainwaves communicate with martians
My fantastic .44 firepower's awesome
No man alive can survive my lyrical army
I don't care if you've got nine lives or five heartbeats
I generate volts like electric eels
'Cause I be sparkin' it like plugs in automobiles
And I'm so for real with my lyrical skill
Mentally ill in the brain like Cypress Hill
Don't try to sneak attack, I'm never sleepin', black
I do three-sixties with my head when I watch my own back
And ya shoulda known that shit was dead from the start
I'll beat you more times a minute than a healthy heart
Rolling deep with niggas by the carload
And air cruisers and some shit, fifty-thousand dollar autos
And I step through your club like a portal
I bag all the bitches because I got more lines than bar codes

[Verse 2: Webb]
Distortion, you better get your hands off my portion
Proceed with caution, I'll get deadly like a bad abortion
I'll dismiss you then re-admit you
Then rip through your crew like diseases do cell tissue
'Cause I bring to mics like gay-bashers bring it to dykes
'Cause when I rip mics it's like blacks fighting for civil rights
I make contact then swoop down like a wombat
And catch niggas out there like bad contracts
My mental status is far beyond the average
I kick you in the chest and make your rhyme have a miscarriage
'Cause I deliver prophecies like disciples
I flip and drop more verses than two stacks of Bibles
So let me tell you, I'll get sick like Bellew
I'll lick eleven shots, god and knock down twelve of you
What? I roll with bad boys like Puff
I send you to Death Row like Daz and Kurupt
I come correct, I keep my mic in my holster
Sleeping up in that ass against the wall like a poster

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Niggas claim they got enough back, look how they act
When I rush that, you ain't ready for combat, hush that
'Cause even though the rats got cheese, they fear the cats
And even though the cats got claws, they fear the dogs
Because my style is thick like eggnog
And I break backs with jaws like traffic laws
Steel walls couldn't protect when I infect
Like an invasion, I'm takin' over like the Asians

[Verse 4: Webb]
Check it, niggas wanna act up, but many are just acting
Claiming they got contacts but who they really contacting?
It's time to separate the truth from the false
I got the bigger name in the game, son you lost
When I come through, niggas always ask, "Who did it?"
'Til death do us part, 'cause to hip-hop I'm committed
No question, no doubt, you know what I'm about
End of story, there's nothing else to talk about
Just listen, I get paid by the rhyme like commission
And like sample clearance, I got niggas asking permission
So what's the decision, innocent or guilty?
'Cause I'ma counterfeit bills until I'm so rich I'm filthy
I'm mystical, when they hear it, spirits fear it
And flee to different dimensions 'cause they don't want to be near it
So one and a one, two, you don't stop it
Rhyme is the subject, god and skills are the topic

[Verse 5: Canibus]
To  anybody think about writing my rhymes, it's not happenin'
All my lyrics got serial numbers, my shit is patented
Right down to the last letter, I'm clever
And everybody knows my flows be mo' better
I'm always gettin' props, word up poss, respect it
'Cause I stay undercover like the crew New York detectives
Until I get provoked, the flow get me heated
I swear I'll hit you so hard your mom dukes'll feel it
So chill, remember who you think you're dealin' with
I'll blow your back out to the point where Jesus couldn't heal it
But if you think you'll hit harder, by all means try it
I spill more blood than a whole clan of vampires
Hittin' niggas with rhymes 'til they pass out like flyers
With new techniques, I change styles like a tire
Without a lug tool, I love when fools talk shit
I put my finger on the mic like ET and sparks it
Extraterrestrial, niggas think I'm incredible
I reproduce with juice extracted from my testicles
