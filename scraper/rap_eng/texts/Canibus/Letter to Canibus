[Wyclef]
Dear Canibus, it's been a minute since we talked
Ever since Drink Champs, you been deep in my thoughts
You still my favorite battle rapper
But why you pull the notebook out on Dizaster

[Canibus]
Even on my weakest moment on my feet like a soldier
When dark clouds block out light and you can't control it
I felt like my moral compass was broken, medication was potent
I heard voices coming out the notebook
Looked up and saw circling vultures, dehydrated, slightly out of focus
I wouldn't wish that on noone
They still talk about that? Cool
Mama ain't raise no fool, I took my black ass back to school
