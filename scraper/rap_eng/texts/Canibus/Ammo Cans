[Hook: Canibus]

Yeah, I am the metronome man
Ten grand in the ammo can
That's my fam, oh fan
Better breathe in the  Canibus Man
Yeah
Ten grand in the ammo can
That's my fam, oh fan
Better breathe in the  Canibus Man

[Verse: Canibus]

Yeah
Remote control microphone melatonin Canibus home
Pheromones interact with my bones
Attack those who are not alone like hollow bones
We gonna climb to the top, if the sky don't close
I spike radiation readings just by bleeding
If I bite whatever I'm feeding when I'm knife eating
Mountain hut rock cut food proficiency socked up
Get that toxic spill mopped up
Don't mess up when you verse your rhyme
Or you will be circumcized
And your foreskin would look gross to mine
And facin' the track contagion
Metaphors explore spaceships on the day ship
From Stingray Clip
This the evolution of the human animal vocalization system
Canibus, wordsmith, spitting rap
Automatic livid systematic synaptic analogous
To telepathic gymnastics
Hand to hand four corner close quarters no floor
My arms 10 foot long, koala bear claws
R-A-W raw, my headgear barely fit on
Canibus got a muscular skull
Psychic boots listening into your mind in the mike booth
You can't calm down you being chased by a white tooth
Hot rum gold tongue cold lungs
The Arctic ones, bright orange midnight sun
