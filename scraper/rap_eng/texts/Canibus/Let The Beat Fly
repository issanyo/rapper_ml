(Intro)

Yea just let the beat fly fly fly
Yea just let the beat fly
Just let the beat fly fly fly
Just let the beat fly
Just let the beat fly fly fly
Just let the beat fly
Do not rewind
We gonna pan one to the left
We gonna pan one to the right

(Canibus)

I told em to go in or get thrown in
I told em no matter what he does he will have no wins
Soon no one will know him or cared what occurred
My symbiotic nerve had me spitting automatic words
When it occurred I was not averse pass a bottle for my thirst
And some dollars for the fresh ass verse
Petalburg network hip hop searched what is the network
A lane my verse over my verse into the universe newly referred to as the dual-verse
But before all that I was sharpshooter vs
Spit box spit boss merc the heaviest ankle on this part of the earth
Pre and post modern earth but a nigga still got to work
Spit a lot of verse dolphin merc surf boarders searchin season and searched
Crazed beats with the sea of tranquility beast up in this piece
