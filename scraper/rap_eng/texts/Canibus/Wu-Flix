English, motherfucker, do you speak it!?

[Verse 1: Gravity]
Fat chinchilla jackets, massive scrilla
Ninja rap, guerrilla tactics, mad master killer
Clan tracksmith, drunk monkey, the bad ass (bastard)
Dispatching nasties on these wack, backpackin' rappers
The samurai tuckin' the blade
You's gon' get your bitch back when I'm done fuckin' her face
I'm shoving a wang in her jaw, let it all (hang)
Orangutan slang, strange renaissance, Capdonna
Page, cage fighter, ghost killah, Wu track force
Visit the village of craft, this is the rap lord
Bang on the repercussion drum, pump slum science
Rum diet, ten rapplications, one client, I am (drunk)
Slumped I am, punch junk, rhyme [?] bolts
So fly, maniacal, fire floats at vile vultures
No style, so idol, wild, so profess
Don't flex on the kid, don't step, aight?

[Sample]
How does one do that? Hm?
How does one kill a man?
It's one thing to dream about it
Very different when you have to do it with your own hand

[Verse 2: Warbux]
This has probably been a long time comin'
And these small time thuggers spent a long time runnin' from this all-time great
Only forty plus a hunnid, but you couldn't hold my weight
So fuck it, straight gunnin' from the old line state
That is Murdalyn, never heard of it? Well, I preferred ya didn't
But the burner's sure to turn your shit into a tourniquet
And you'll be learnin' quick
I'm earnin' as earnest a livin' as any surgeon is with every word I spit
And every bird I flip, I'm raising the stakes here
Literarilly, should be comparing me to Shakespeare
A little heresy, but something I wanna make clear
I'm just a lost soul at the crossroads of the eighth sphere
"The Devil's gate's near," that's what they all say
And then they see my long grey beard and a 3 pronged blade
So on a off day, I might perform facial feng shui
Till your nostrils are facing the wrong way

[Verse 3: Canibus]
This is Wu-Flix, knock your teeth out with a toothpick
I hear you spittin' that bullshit
I chop your mama arm off with a katana and stick dick to ya father
You won't ever be the same, grasshopper
"I'll murder the motherfucker," yeah, I know you would
There are many things the rest of us would do if we could
I do whatever it takes to keep you alive
I go outside, knowing that I'm gonna die
Standing in the corner, I got my Sticky Fingaz face on
Count to four, bum rush the door
Nigga tried to rush me, I bust three
Turn him to duck meat, the 187 was rusty
Motherfucker don't touch me, walk around, everybody love me
Benetton suits and gumbys
So if the boy wants to have sex, then let him have sex
When he turns eighteen, I'll let him sleep with my ex, next

[Verse 4: DZK]
My iron fortress is protected by the eye of Horus
The vile sorcerer that rides atop of wild horses
Settle scores of vendettas, left your shelter scorched
Delta squad, melt your paws with a welder's torch
Never knelt before God, never felt remorse
Spinning propellers, left fellas short on my heliport
In the morgue cellar, fill a drawer with a headless corpse
My album's fucked up, that shit'll never sell in stores (No)
My consumer base is viewed as a mutant race
Humans that groove from the fumes of nuclear waste
If you get a taste of my music, you get erased
And interchange with the image of your living Wraith
Grippin' what the city can't, pistol whippin' little fake
Children when I'm spittin' written riddles in a fit of rage
I wanna murder motherfuckers with my vocal sound
And choke 'em with the smoke that get ejected from my open mouth

[Sample]
Damn it, this guy sure moves fast
You're a famous fighter, you shouldn't say that
Not about you [?]
Huey, put up
