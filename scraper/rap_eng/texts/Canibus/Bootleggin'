[Verse : Canibus]
Seconds turn into hours but what is the point in having this power
If you wouldn't last for twenty four hours?
Try to steel what is not even perceived to be real
The best emcee in the world does not have a record deal
Never had a record deal but that nigga is ill
Keep it real, it took skills for him to spit what he feels
While some try to get back to the top of the billboard charts
You can't tell me that you're following your heart
It was ours from the start, sharp lyrical thoughts
Your bars are sub par you deserve a cynical response
You should switch places with me and see what it cost me
Then talk to me and see if I'm who you wanna be
I live off the wig that me and my spouse get
I'm a tax paying citizen so I don't give a shit
Love it or hate it, he spit like he one of the greatest
You couldn't duplicate his music verbatim, keep complaining
I stand by the shed, slowly twisting the 'napse in my head
I'm through deceiving as you listen to this
I am the midnight lyricist, your worst nightmare nemesis
Look at me so you won't ever remember this
The attention was ungenerous, Eminem or Canibus?
That's what the man's motherfucking answer is
Tragic Allies to the end, you can't steal what you didn't give
Grab the mic and get biz, that's how I live
