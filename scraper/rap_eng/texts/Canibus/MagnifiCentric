(Canibus)

Aiyo Hip Hop is hectic tell Centric to send Bis
And if he can't bring it back send Rip
Canibus 'MagnifiCentric' on the offensive
Beats bang you in the head 'til it's bent and dented
Spit a sentence too endless to defend against it
One entrance no exit through the barbwire trenches
Cyclone wire fences fire, fuck a Second Amendment
They might check it like they want my attention
Activate all of your senses creating the template
On some no return address shit, like who the fuck sent this
I did, you don't wanna know where I live
The rhyme is inside your mind behind eyelids
I spit third eye logic, my pupil couldn't fit in your socket
The robot prophet with IR Optics
Dirty bars on the table, break three legs and a ankle
The fourth leg was fractured by a nine degree angle

(Chorus 4X: Canibus)
You live by the illest, you die by the illest
If it's alive and it writes rhymes I can kill it

(Canibus)

I grind, I scramble, I put them both together and gramble
Bag up the gram, separate the samples
The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to
My lyrics lynch you, give you something to hang to
Your fans mourn, mumbling your song
While the Son of Sam prepares for war
My hands form ram horns
Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly
Sadly he's not too punchy, but still jabby
Stick and move keep stepping, follow my reflection
Demolition any nigga disrespecting the profession
Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction
Is there ever enough protection? The quintessential question
Unroll your maps I'ma show you where we at
Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps
You heard of that, my sandbag leak worser than that
The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat

Chorus x4

(Canibus)

Holding hands in the prayer booth Coupe '45 on the strong side
Dry cleaned suit, snub nose in the boot
Get born again to go to war again
Calling men, tell them start falling in
Hip Hop must not fall again
Chainsaw to the jaw, that's where I'ma cut you
Waterproof duffle, that's where I'ma stuff you
The rainforest jungle, that's where I'ma dump you
And God don't love you so he ain't gonna judge you
They tell me, "Go to Hell", I'm fire proof, fuck you
I trigger the explosives with an iPod Shuffle
Gilly suit camo, gold ammo
Barrel longer than a street lamppost, damn yo

(Chorus x2)
