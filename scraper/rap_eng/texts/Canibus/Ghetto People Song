[Sample Hook, "Ghetto People Song"]:
Ghetto people song, only them can sing this one

[Verse 1: Canibus]:
They say the devil's time is short
So what, sport?
We still ain't free
They still lying on radio and TV
The centuries turn into minutes; humanity's finished
Forced organ harvest, what's for dinner?

[Canibus sings and raps in Jamaican Patois]

Butcher the meat
Chop up the beak
Dig out him ribcage
Blow him out the reach
Fire burn hot
Ital in a' deh pot
Women head wrap up, she walk round in a flat
Bobo dread water-bong, Maroon sing-song
How long ya there, foreigner in a Babylon belly man?
Then you no know?
Fire shot fling stone
(???)
(???)
Bad man dun a van tear off Jah
Try gallavant, every bloodclot ting a get jam
Dis tiger bone tonic son, drink that
Which gyal want pop it fi di pussy, bring that

[Verse 2: Canibus]:
[Jamaican Patois]
Bareface, they kyas and clean up the place
I sent a [butler out for] buy front bricks
Man upon road no tek catch a buss man
I know man I still buy ore
Substance dominate rhymes
Styles trail closely behind
They work together, you don't need to choose sides
Dystopian present time, immigration talk to a leprechaun
Motherfucker ain't no friend of mine
If he's worth his weight in sodium, step to the podium
Ingest the polonium
While promoting electroneum
Cryptosporidium
The next coin for the millenium
Check the chlorine levels before you swim in it
Immigrant: Uncle Sam
Music industry Umberts Man
I heard Ice about to raid Summer Jam
When the sun disappears, the fear of the moon is a shared emotion
Among men everywhere

[Verse 3: Canibus]:
Meta-Fortnite, nano-mic; volcano cancel your flight
Ash in the air, clash of the titans
Man-made throwing fertilizer in the fan blade
DNA de-energize by high gamma waves, slaves
Close to old age, told to behave
The youth strayed so far from the way the they were raised
More locks, more keys, more prisons, more thieves
If pedophilia's a crime then why they go free?
I rarely generalize, but who goes to parties to consume drugs wrapped in cheese, bruh
Inquiring minds don't give a *frrrup* what you know
They just wanna see the deposit slips, yo
Relocate, move in with grandpa
Meanwhile Grandma goes in to live with prince bandar
Domingo, my nigga
Thanos the rhythm trigger
Percussion paint picture for the everyday listener
