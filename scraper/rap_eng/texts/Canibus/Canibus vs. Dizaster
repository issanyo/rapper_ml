[Round 1: Canibus]
Those look like Tom Cruise mom shoes
Soaked in some nasty ass wanton soup
You 'bout to lose, what you got to prove?
Yeah, who you gon' rap circles around?
Turn around, ‘cause you ain't allowed to worship the crown
You look like a dead bird on the ground
With your bones exposed, this is your funeral services now
This is your death, Diz, pour it out, pass it around
I laugh at your style, the wise owl laughs at the crowd
Pound for pound? I clip your wings, lift your ass off the ground
Throw you in the air, crash you in the clouds
Slaughterhouse? What the fuck is you talking about?
I brought enough rhymes to snuff all four of them out
I bet you hang out with Elton John in Lebanon
When Eminem's gone
So both of y'all can make feminine bars
You must be smokin', hopin' an opium pipe
If you think you gon' win tonight
Yeah right, these people came to see a fight
I'ma fuck you up in this battle royale, yeah, dawg
I'ma make you not wanna ever rap no more
‘Cause you cheatin'!
You know you in agreement with demons; you suckin' semen! You really think that's air that you breathin'?
You dirty fucking scumbag trashbag of scum
You look like a vampire that drinks faggot blood
And you gonna catch that fade, baby
The streets is watching, like Jay Z
I'll squeeze your IV 'til you sit up and face me
You crazy, your EKG beepin' like you lazy
Fuck you! Pay me, or donate it to Haiti!
To be here today, I had to hypnotize myself
But it's impossible to lie to myself
Look at him! It's like I'm standing beside myself
He bit my whole fucking style
I got MMA niggas in the crowd
I should make them whoop your ass right now
Ayo, hood niggas! What's good, nigga?
Wing nuts, battle you in the woods around trees and ninjas
Battle rap 20 degrees colder in the winter
In the summer I'm sizzler, roll you up like rizzlers
Toss you a thousand bars, nigga, tell you to bench it
Then I battle you again, just to see if you meant it
Look at the people on the rooftop, the people on the fences
You came here healthy, you gon' leave here injured
Real gladiators gotta bleed in the trenches
Go ahead, Diz, do your famous Slim Shady impression!
Bring 5'9" in the session, I teach the three of you a lesson
I spit real rap shit, you pop shit, no question
Dizaster and his fans is a bunch of bitches
You know I'm hardcore, I showed up with stitches
Come on, Diz, now you know you in over your head
When there's people in the crowd
That memorize battle rhymes I said
I'll battle you in the flesh, I'll battle you on the net
I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect
I'll battle you for respect, I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'll battle you over the toilet with my dick out
I'll battle you juggling a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinking a Guiness Stout doing a 360 spinout
You already know, I look like Riddick, out the slam
You a Arabic Peter Pan lookin' out for the clan
Come on, fam, you know the big bad wolf eat the lamb
I'm a tiger with infinite stripes, you Tucan Sam
Damn! You know cocaine's a hell of a drug
Made this dumbfuck wanna battle Can-I-Bus
I told this nigga, I'm takin' your ass to Disneyland
I'ma piss in your mouth, while you shittin' your pants
And while the lyrics enhance, my fans gonna shit on your fans
I'm glad you a battle thug
The big bad wolf gonna drink a glass of your blood
I'll use your skin for a fuckin' prayer rug
I'll destroy you, I hated you the first time I saw you
Mothafuckas like you get buried for being loyal
I'm ashamed of Hip-Hop for even praising you
You don't exist before YouTube
‘Cause you ain't really paid no dues
You make me sick! You get respect for saying stupid shit
Your fans are clueluess, they think you got juice and shit
Everytime you in Atlanta, Eddy Long is your pastor
You a rug trader traitor, a fake gold jewlery chain maker
A slum dog millionaire's neighbor
I'm a Jamaican assasin, you a Dizaster waitin' to happen
You couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper napkin
I jumped out my momma pussy
You fell out your mother booty all wiggly
Covered in humus, all filthy
I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You study my rhymes, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, something that Dizaster would do
You say you the best battler in the world?
You ain't telling the truth
You studied my background, ain't no book that I wrote
Ain't no footnotes, your whole style is one big joke
From DNA to Arsonal to KOTD
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy
I'm a apex predator, you a battle rap degenerate
Tryin' to gain leverage from a high fructose beverage

[Round 1: Dizaster]
Yo, whatever y'all expecting from me
Today think the reversal of that
Today every single verse that I rap
Is gonna have zero personal attacks
I'ma use the science and math and shit that you teachin'
And I'ma murk you with that
No personals, no jokes, just lyricism
‘Cause Hip-Hop has always been like that
So anything he says to me intellectual
I'ma be able to flip right back
I can teach y'all how to chemically break down an enzyme flat
Stabilize the temperature using incubators
Which condense molecules that turns into H2O, you can get right back, ‘cause when particles…
Wait a minute, y'all thought I was gonna come out here
And spit some stupid shit like that?!
Ayo, let me get this fuckin' word off
Fuckin' faggot brought all of his homies with him
He hasn't even got his verse off
And this little fucking homo already got his shirt off
You wanna shit the […], you get killed and […]
You fucking pussy, you probably paint your pinky nails
And chill with him at Chippendale's
Welcome to Hell, Germaine, the wrath is comin'
This is the part of the rap you get your ass confronted
Then I catch you in the back gettin' relaxed and blunted
And set the place on fire
'Til it feels like you sittin' inside of a dragon's stomach
You cats don't want it
You get castrated and hacked in nuggets
I make chicken strips out of your loved ones
That's what I call a "Family Bucket"
I'm like KFC when I pull the axe out
You get slashed and gutted, so fast even the King Of the Dot staff will need panoramic camera coverage
Just to capture the angles of blood back
From the other side of the room when I drag you from it
Fuckin' yelling over my shit like they always do
That's some shit I already knew
But what's wrong with you Canibus?
What is it, you fucked it up doing some skateboarding stuff?
I'm tryin' to figure out how you ended up
With your bones getting crunched
But now it makes sense, I get it, you punched yourself in the chest so hard you made your own shoulders touch
You had a fall from grace
Fell a long way from the praise that he's gotten
To being straight misplaced and forgotten
Nowadays from place to place he be hoppin'
But he never feels safe
No matter where's at, from all the names he be droppin'
And he keeps droppin' names
Even after all the pain that it cost him
He stays takin' losses, LL Cool J basically stomped him
The same happened with Slim Shady
Even though you initiated the problem
So it's safe to say after today, this'll be the nail in his coffin
I got infinite skill…
Even if you took millions and millions of pills
Like the kid from the film Limitless, you still couldn't think of shit that's this ill; I'm ill, ridiculous, chill
You physically built like a little bitch
Your squad trippin' then they all gettin' killed
Your dogs, I'm skinning them
Knitting them into a sweater quicker than Cruella de Vil
Look at this fuckin' treatment I'm givin' him!
Look at the treatment I'm givin' this old ass senior citizen
That wouldn't be seen within the reach of 300 feet
Of the streets of Michigan, from all the nightmares and dreams of Slim repeatedly rippin' him
I ain't Peter Griffin, so why do I beef with this chicken?
Jabbin' and kickin repeatedly until he bleeds from his ribs
And then falls asleep on the concrete
In the same fetal position he was left in ever since Eminem beat his career in submission and didn't let him spit again
Blackballed and restricted him
Blocked him from his mission or any other business attempts
So, techically, Slim ended up stiffin' him
Harder than he did to Kim ever since the last time the bitch attempted taking half of his shit from him
You a pitiful guy, miserable type sucker
You lived in a time cluster where it was easy for getting by
‘Cause most of the industry lines
Were missing those intricate rhyme structures
So your lyrics to them were like mind-fuckers
But as the Internet winds, buffered
You realized it's harder to keep up with these little guys
‘Cause it's like a million times tougher
I mean, looking at him, I feel like the Universe just wants to witness this guy suffer, ‘cause he's going through hell
And LL's out in some ridiculous-priced suburb
He probably lives with a white butler
Who every night is hired to fix him a nice supper
He literally drives like 65 hummers
And everyone of them is specifically a different type of color
Yo, y'all know what rhymes with Germaine Williams?
(NEVER MADE MILLIONS!)
That's what it is! Never made millions!
That dude, I don't know who he is, but he's straight brilliant
So, what happend after your successive second round knock out? Exactly, nothing happened!
There was no one left on Earth for Canibus to call out
So he pretty much ran out of things to talk about
The industry blocked him out
And they fuckin' locked him out
And we didn't hear from him again 'til he popped up in a song calling out every single member from Slaughterhouse
You would've socked every one of them out? Pfft, don't be mad at them because you took the hater/salty route
Mothafucka, everybody hates your guts
You called everybody out from Slaughterhouse
Except Crooked I ‘cause Crooked I would've stomped you out
Bro, everybody fuckin' hates you
What the fuck are you talking 'bout? We interviewed LL
And even his own mama said to knock you out
Look at the bright side, you're like a certified author now
You can write a novel on what being blackballed is all about
It's probably all them call-outs
And them blogs and why he had a falling-out
It's like being inside of a poolhall when watchin' his ass fall, ‘cause he got ate, blackballed and then they chalked him out
Fuck are you talking 'bout?
He wants to rap with me, we all miss that Canibus
That used to attack with the thirst, rage
Snap and burst, like an animal that's trapped in a dirt cage
But nowadays you uninspired
And I can see the cracks in your wordplay
You're saying "Aww, I kept it true to Hip-Hop"
Blahblahblahblah, that's what the herbs say
You took your ball home and went home
‘Cause things in the industry weren't happening your way
You wanted to become famous too
You and LL were suppose to collab on the first tape
But he bodybagged you off the track in the worst way
Then you came back and you said
"It wasn't about the fame, it's about being heard
And there's a purpose to every actual verse made."
But that's the impact the accurate words make, ‘cause if it was truly about the art, and the lab was your workplace
Then you would've never wanted to be
On a track like that in the first place
I fuckin' hate it when people try to go mainstream
And then flip-flop, and then they try to disguise their failure
As them being true to Hip-Hop
So I don't give a fuck what you got to talk about
Next time one of your homies pops out
That's how you do a fuckin' first round knock-out!

[Round 2: Canibus]
You fucking Iranian shoe-bombing, Islamic Math Hoffin'
Jewish Bronze Solomon, in Jesus Christ name, Amen!
Separated shoulder, crawlin' outta border control
I ain't have enough quarters for the toll
$300 dollar bounty, it took 10 days before I got out the country
They was fightin' all around me, this is how they found me
I came here to do you worse than DNA did
I wanted it to be no more wins for you in this battle rap biz
I wanted to eat your fuckin' heart
Two chambers at a time, ‘cause maybe after that you'll understand the danger of the rhyme
Gravity is a repulsion, not an attraction
When it comes to lyrics
I used to be the living Bruce Lee in action
Counter-psychological measures reduce the pressure
Who's better? That mothafucka? Never!
It's gonna take a lot more than him
To make Can-I-Bus a believer
Man, I thought you was gonna walk out with Justin Bieber
I never met a battler that act like Stan so much
He wanna be Marshall so bad
He put up bread to battle Can-I-Bus
Tell 'em! You hang out with Elton John in Lebanon when Eminem's gone, so both of y'all can massage RuPaul's balls
Are you a faggot or a faggot magnet?
Why the fuck are you so obsessed with eating rappers' asses?
What are you, Dizaster? Are you an Iranian monkey trainer?
A middle-eastern gospel country singer?
Or a hot urine-drinkin', camel-kissing sand nigga?
Is that a urostomy bag? Come here, let me talk to you, man
Somebody strip search this terrorist fag!
That's right, I smell the fear, somewhere in here and up there
I seen the piss running down the stairs
I bet you in your whole life never even cleaned one weapon
You play Call of Duty and do Scarface impressions
Chill, bedrin! Real G's come out to see the legends
Nobody gives a shit about the honorable mentions
If I catch him levitatin', I'm devastatin'
I'll shave him and suffocate him
Then bring him back to life to interrogate him
You fuckin' Pagan! What I told you about meditatin'?
What the fuck is a Canadian Arabian?
I'm Rip the Jacker! The white chapel black battler
Say it faster, Dizaster is a punchline ameteur
You can't even ride a beat! Get your bitch-ass off the street!
Your bitch-ass should be across the street
Talk is cheap, until a lyrical metal jacket lift you off your feet
I been the goddamn a cappella chief all week
When I'm done with you, you gon' be rappin' in China
Somewhere with no runnin water, battlin' minors
With Fresh Coast tonighters
And a fresh slice of Fresh Coast hepatitis
You a pedophile that bites vaginas!
In a dark room eatin' mosquitos, flies, and spiders
'Bout to get waterboarded, hooked up to two wires
The crowd say "ooh", the crowd say "ahh"
Unlimited rounds, you must be in the mood to die!
Mema-se mama-sa mama-makusa
I put a tattoo of you on Treach's arm right next to 2Pac

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Metal jackets, you pathetic faggot
I will stomp you to death, I'm a fuckin' hustler
So when I be callin people, you know, I call to collect
But when Canibus be calling people
You know, he be callin' collect
See, you wanna talk the talk out here, just deposit the check
‘Cause if not, I'm gonna fuckin' stomp you to death
See, out in the East you can talk that talk
But if you talk that talk in the West
You leave like Flava Flav, just another skinny little black faggot gettin' clocked in his chest
Then he said I'm like Slim Shady! I'm tryin' to be Slim Shady
Just for saying that you're gonna end up demolishing yourself
Bro, that whole part you were talking about, I didn't know if you were referring to me or talking about yourself
‘Cause ain't nothing worse in the world
Than that track that you did with Stan
What was it, the Four Horsies?
You guys got back together back in Scribble Jam?
Or was it at the Rap Olympics, fam?
Either way, nobody fucking gives a damn!
Aye, listen, bro! I pull it out and I snap it and click and BAM!
Kinda like my gat already had an app for Instagram
This motherfucker wants to take my ass to Dizneyland
Sorry, Dad, I'ma scratch that, because I have a different plan
How 'bout I take you to the ranch in Neverland
And put you in a casket quicker than
A thousand miligrams of Michael Jackson's diprivan
Fucker thought he was gonna come back and kill me
Man, this motherfucker Canibus sucks!
Besides, all it took back in the day
Was two l's and a cool J to roll Canibus up
And since we in Cali, I'ma pour magazines in him
That's what I call a Canibus cup!
But I'm just clownin' with you
You obviously a mark, don't make this clown shit an issue
I'll rip your body apart, I'll fire rounds from the pistol
My shells are like the red ones from Mario Kart
‘Cause they follow you around 'til they hit you
My guns gon' feel like a merry-go-round once they 'gainst you
‘Cause they gonna lift you four horsies
Off the ground and then spin you
That's some crazy shit whenever you reach the top
Let's say right now you can fuckin' take me on, yeah
I've already got this region locked, bro, I am the King of the Dot
You? Ooh… let me teach you something, bruh
Let me teach you how to keep the spot
You couldn't, ‘cause your value in it would decrease the stock
But this ain't 2000 BC, I guess he forgot
Mothafucka, you shouldn't even talk; his old ass is probably still sitting here waiting for the beat to drop!
You're not even sharp, at least not enough for me
Not enough for this league, I mean
What good is marching on soft sand
When you don't have strong enough feet to walk on concrete?
And your schemes are not built up
To par with the top tiers we got
Man, you should take it a little easy, pops
‘Cause you're gettin a lil' old, and out here people speed a lot
Proceed with caution
There ain't no beat in this arena to cover up your cheesy bars
I can visibly see your flaws
Allowing me to use them as a weakness that I'm feeding off
But the leading cause of beef that's caused between us
Is a missing link of not being able to think or ever be evolved
See, it's easy to see why he dissolved
Because he's a subspecies
So even though everything we're taught to believe revolves
Around us being engineered human beings
We're clearly not, because seeing people like him breathin'
Are the real reasons I don't believe in God
And if there's like a one in a fucking six billion chance that my theory's wrong? I put my cheese up on it
That this idiot would completely defeat the odds
You ain't a thief that robs people ‘cause you evil, dog
You a thief that robs people ‘cause you need a job
You wanna eat? Then I beat you over the head
With a piece of beef kabob
And let you bleed across the street from Ross
The same place you faggots buy your t-shirts off
Homie, I will kill you as soon as the fucking needle drops
Run outside, and have my homies let the heater off
And blood will be fillin' up the street, like it was Cedar Block
You're not strong enough to top your peak
Just face it, you've aged and you've gotten weak
You can no longer keep on pace with today's top elites
Not a cappella or on a beat. Stop blogging, please!
If not at least while you still got a spot to keep
You used to be a role model to all these geeks; even gangstas looked up to you like when a respected father speaks
See, the problem is, to Hip-Hop, you are unique
That's why it also bothers me
‘Cause I feel like I'm putting my own dog to sleep
Watchin' the karma seep
Watchin 'him burn alive from the inside as the karma seeps
From your eyes onto your rotten cheeks
‘Cause the Canibus we used to know
Now is a shallow surface that's far from deep
And all that's left for you at the end
Is the nightmares that haunt your sleep
Along with the psychological scars you keep as a product of the karma you've gotten from fucking over all your peeps
So I don't give a fuck! Homie, I get my G on
I'm a real MC, mothafuckas, I get my free on
So it makes sense that this mothafucka here
Has this stupid ass sling on
‘Cause he's never been a good shoulder to lean on

…

[Round 3: Canibus]
Yo, that's not what I would call Diz
See, Diz is something different
A faggot nigga tryin' to make a living off of dissin'
He walk around spittin' battle raps like he ill
But he can't avoid the fact, yeah, he do got skills
2012, I still spit that shit real niggas feel
Why does 99% of you resemble Madd Illz?
Too late, wipe that stupid look off your face
[…] lookin' like that indian from Office Space
Dizaster, just stop it! You tryin' to battle on some pop shit
You weak, and you sound like Andy Milanokis!
Ayo, brother, I'm just here to tell you
That God loves all his creations… except you
And after tonight your battle rap career will be through
Then I'ma hop into the back seat of your cab and ride
The fuck you lookin at me for, Ali? Drive!
This ain't no regular battle, this about your intellectual power
A cold blooded disrespect for an hour
Genocide by drone strike, Dizaster's bones in a cave
He in the Strone Age, playing cee-lo with stone dice
God put me here to eat shit and die!
But when I made the infinite rhyme? He changed his mind
But you? You just a funny guy
With peanut-butter brown honey eyes; when I look into the windows of your soul, I don't see much inside
That's why right here right now, June 9th, 06/06
Canibus gonna prove that Dizaster ain't shit!
Ayo, I stick dick to your moms
Build a nuclear bomb and put it in her thong!
I rediscovered Hip-Hop with my infinite rhyme
I'll even put the President back in office one more time
I charge Oprah's credit card
And tell Barack to go long for another 90 yards
Mothafucka, I'm a Hip-Hop god! 20 years and I still got job
I'm sayin' if you want change?
Go wash them shit stains out your draws
You immature fecal spore
Got the nerve to say you a beast with the bars
Don't you still live with your moms?
That's right, dick in your mouth!
Parents had to kick you out the house
After that, you moved in with your spouse
I can't tell if you a deadbeat dad, or a red meat fag
Or a greasy ass nasty piece of Lebanese trash

#

[Round 3: Dizaster]
Yo! Let me just end this fuckin' battle!
If anymore of this shit's gonna get postponed
This mothafucka's mad at me
‘Cause he's always gettin' his ho boned
He said I live at home with my parents
You're right, I'm 28 and I live in a crib that I don't own
But that makes me more qualified to smoke Canibus
Because I've always been home-grown
Don't be mad though, you lost to the MVP
I will always still be the best emcee
I'm just mad at you because I took all this time to prepare
And you fuckin' disrespected me
You disrespected me, like you disrespected all
You disrespected Pharoahe Monch
You disrespected Wyclef, you hated on 'em all
Anybody doing more than you
You preyed and you waited on their fall
That's why I ain't speakin' for me, I'ma say this for us all
That's why Hip-Hop has forsaken you
And here you don't deserve a place at all
But in the restroom next to the toilet, hanging by the stall
But you don't even deserve to hang there either
‘Cause I can still find more appreciation
On the piss stains that are on the wall
You had a legendary cypher
With DMX, Big Pun and Mos Def, my dude
Yeah, that shit is true, we seen it online, it got plenty of views
But the problem with that is
That you said you deserved to go last out of all of them
What makes you think you credible or even legible to?
‘Cause 10 years have passed, and the evidence proved
That them three did more for Hip-Hop
Individually than you ever could do
So I don't want you to get mad
Let this just be a lesson to you; to act selfish in a cypher is something that's hella self-centered to do
But you're Canibus… it's okay
You get a pass ‘cause it's expected from you
You think you're bigger than Pun? Pun is a legend, my dude
He's a worldwide icon that's sold more records
And he's more respected than you
You? You're just a homeless man
On the corner holdin' a can beggin' for food
Just accept it! You're through!
Accept that you were never accepted
Instead you just do some extra reckless shit and just prove
You will always be a liability to anybody that's invested in you
Just ask Wyclef! He'll tell you like the rest of them dudes
Your album flopped when it dropped, so you stabbed him in the back because you couldn't get it to move
When you should've said thank you to him
‘Cause he's the one that helped you improve
Wassup, M80? Where you at, you pathetic Jew?
Together you are like fucking tumors
In the business, that needs to get removed
Everyone that you ever did business with to help your music in the end is getting screwed, yourself included!
What about all the efforts and attempts that you did to get us sued because some shit in the contract was left excluded?
Yeah, don't believe nothing he's saying!
If you do then your head's polluted; this is why he's a disrespectful piece of shit and he's getting executed
I don't wanna hear about how ur presence helps the movement; it's more like an infection to it
You ain't here for us, you're here to fuckin' sell some units
How you gonna help us when you haven't even showed no sign of self-improvement?
Just the same old, pathetic, under-developed human
Who never went through evolution
I mean, this dude is stone age! Why try to relate with him?
I should go on MySpace to find him a primate
To go on a blind date with him
‘Cause in his mindstate, that would be the prime mate for him!
He's a chrome magnum man
A homosapien bipedal and shell, with the brain missin'
The way that he reacts, he has strange thinkin'
The way he displays rhythm
He's so ancient, I can't even communicate with him
It's like he has the most important strand of DNA missin'
So it has nothing to do with racism
When I say I see the ape in him
I'll stab you in your fuckin' eyes
With a giant identical set of forks
To Poseidon's, or the type of forks that Lucifer pitches
Inside of the fires in Hell that scorch
When I'm rhyming, I'm at the center core
Of a high-pressure reservoir of eternal fire that's strong enough to survive behind Heaven's door
And if you stay alive, I'ma keep firin' with the rifle
Like I'm tryin' to set the record storm
Your body will show up at a fuckin beach somewhere dead
You can finally rest a shore/assure!
This mothafucka has spent his whole life on a message board
He's always on the net; this guy's like a tennis court
I mean, the crease above your eyes look like vinyl record warps
You look like some time of Kenyan dwarf
Collided with a virally infected I Am Legend corpse
Spliced with the fuckin' DNA of the alien from Splice
Or some other type of genetic source
That was developed directly inside of the Umbrella Corp
You killed the crowd, no one wants to even react no more!
What you actin' like a fuckin faggot for?
So I'ma end it with this last scheme… Everything that he did was toally fucking wack and was overhyped
Your fucking deposit for this battle was totally overpriced
But it's worth it knowing that we can go home at night
Knowing some lunatic named Germaine Williams doens't own the rights, ‘cause if he did he would probably attach the footage to the back of a radioactive protocol device
Or something else that completely never existed
Like his military soldier stripes
Who gives a fuck if "so and so" sold their soul for ice?
You're becoming more of an attention whore
With every metaphor you write
This motherfucker's terrified of anybody that's 5'9"
‘Cause it reminds him of Royce's height
When you get killed in a battle, you're supposed to fight
What are you, like 40, right?
All you did was burn bridges like Usher, you're the corny type
You blackballed yourself into the horizon
With Benzino riding with you on the back of the motorbike
Have you seen that tattoo on his arm?
LL hates him, of course he's hype
This motherfucker couldn't beat him in a battle
So he turned around and literally stole his mic
So how the fuck are you gonna call J. Cole "J. Clone"
Callin' him a clone, despite knowing that the only tat on your arm showing ain't even your own prototype
Homie, it's over! Go home, goodnight!
You wanna threaten LL and show up to the video with Mike
But we're all thinking, of course you roll with Mike
You and him are both alike, ‘cause judging by that tattoo
Both you faggots were born to bite!
Yeah, so he's gonna talk about how I choked
And didn't own the fucking moment, right?
He'll probably mention some shit
He didn't, but I'ma still own him, right?
Ayo, this motherfucker shouldn't be mad at me
‘Cause I'm the one who helped him walk back toward the light
I'm the one that showed him what real hope is like
Yeah, I'm the one that gave him a chance
After the industry already disowned him twice
They fuckin' left him, they controlled his life
So I don't give a fuck if I choked up in a battle or if I froze that night, ‘cause Canibus over here fuckin' choked in LIFE!
Nobody wants to hear anymore
So I'ma shoot to this fuckin' faggot
I'll pull out a Bazooka and shoot him
While he's moving through traffic
I'm an Islamic suicidal, cuckoo fanatic
I'll put Canibus in a box, and LL Cool J's a FAGGOT!
