[Verse: Canibus]
The Necronomicon got us starving like Ramadan
Standing roadside with a piece of cardboard for Chinese Yuan, c'mon
Isolate the subject from his friends family and his co workers
Minimum wage means no purchase
No job - no purpose, run around praise the lord in churches
I pray to God my old sins don't surface
The 1st Testament God gets jealous, look at what he did to impress us, he stopped the world with a nuclear weapon
I beg him, please grant us one thousand years of peace
The East visit the West, the West visits the East
Brother should not war with brother, our ancestors were stubborn
They kicked the can down the road for nothing
The burden of being black and murdered, being whacked behind the curtain but what if you really didn't deserve it?
Doesn't matter, they want blood - no less, no more
We are consumed by war, a slave class y'all
Scraps on the table, forage for more food when I am able
So much abundance, praise Azazel
You have no heart, you have no conscience
Completely immoral, God bless the godless
Mud water boots drying off by the book of Genesis
A new way of life is imminent
You ain't special, they gonna get you
I ain't talking about nobody in particular, it's hypothetical
Think critical, reticle scan by sentinel
Everybody left the theatre sad but it was memorable
Cross over the border to Mexico
Pepe said, "Yo if I was you, I would do that slow"
The Godzilla Nimrod, tomahawk look from the side
He screamed out he was from Brooklyn with pride
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
But I ain't gotta go there for me to say it that way
Black rock, tungsten padlocks, land locked
No trash box, they said it was toxic, the readings were hot
They water boarded Mos Def, woke up couldn't go back to sleep
Blacktronica lounge, Tanya and me
We danced around in shanty town wearing hand me downs
Wow, back from the war, I drink brandy now
Whiskey sour after sundown, low crawl on the ground
Got sand in my mouth, I'm in Miami now
Snapped out of it, didn't know where I was, she messed up my buzz, she don't love me but she give me massage
And no matter how bad things turn out today
When I watch her dance, it all goes away
A golden Kazakh eagle soars over Hajj
Looking down at the crowds, it was just a mirage
The tenants in the house of cards are too big to jail behind bars
Their problems too big to solve
The body cannot be free when the mind is in prison
Ears that hear are no match for ears that listen
Eyes that see are no match for eyes that see through
Yes, I am a slave and so are you
Bless, ignorance, weakness is a symptom of innocence
Pay your penance, go join the prisoners
Chemtrails, airborne spills, destroy your sense of smells
Die now, die later, heads or tails
Photovoltaic array at red dawn before that day
Exactly what I saw I cannot say
In case you haven't noticed I practice patience, focus
Freemason emotion, cold, the coldest
Pagans and their potions, kidnap you under the oceans
It's hard to believe sea monsters wear clothing
Some live in the present, some live in the future
It doesn't matter cause we all live inside a computer
I was a mobile cell phone owner, wireless station controller
It didn't help my radiation exposure
From the higgs boson fermions and protons
At this rate I will always discover more songs
Upset, bored, nothing else to do but record
Or spend time with family and get ignored
No electricity of course
Now we can all sit down at the table and be a family of four
A great new attitude on life
In spite of being loved only a little and even less liked
Find your ambitious side, the odds greatly stacked against my kind
But I still gotta try
I ain't hating on the rich and the famous, I just hate the way they played us, they never give us equal exchanges
No individuals are named, they allocate false blame
No change just more of the same
They're inspired by their desires, a steady stream of water projected between a ring of fire, a pyre of fire
The devil never compromises, the leaders were wrong
Judgement comes down from the skies and fries us all
That's why they dropped the ball
