[Canibus]
I speak in frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin
Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineerin
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Fly around the earth twice without refuelin once
Ain't too many categories I can fit in when it comes to spittin
Cause I'm overqualified for the position
The lazer-guided, lyrical hybrid
Creatin scripts so sick, I gotta arm wrestle my pen to write it
Don't get excited, cause if I ever catch one of you motherfuckers bitin
We're gonna be fist fightin!  So motherfuckers what'chu want?
I got the shotgun pumped
You feel like a frog nigga then jump
I posess the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warm blooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you, eat a mouthful of your crew
The type of MC you can't outdo
I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect
I'll battle you over the...
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'll battle you standin over the toilet, with my dick out
Battle you jugglin a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinkin a Guinness Stout, doin a 360 spinout!
