[Intro: Busta Rhymes with Cappadonna and perhaps Canibus in the background]

I see ya racing in the (?) Gimme that bitch!
Always in the war, damn
You heard?
Kidding!
Busta rollin' with the best motherfuckers in the game right now
Come on!

[Hook: Block McCloud]

We got the illest team
We swarm like killa beez
You can chop like guillotine
Cause only I'm a living dream
Can-I-Bus is in me
I bust a rhyme deliver C's
Best believe it baby I'm a living dream

[Verse 1:  Busta Rhymes]
Check, see how the streets will get you stopping and looking
When I'm in the kitchen seasoning the concoction and cook and look
A lot of you niggas trash like it's hard just to step it up
The guru with a gourmet, a scientist and a chef in a
A restaurant for the heat and a deli that will always serve the hood
24 hours, feeding niggas the hors-d'oeuvres
God rap prophecy, Bust Rhymes the Great
Prepare a full course meal, juice leakin' from the steak
Check, acting like you ain't knowing, you niggas must be idiots
Yeah I know my name already, Bus Rhymes and affiliates
But slip mode in this bitch, the alliance must be kinda serious
Damnit Jerry thing in the building regardless where it is
The way I saturate the street I'm only saying
I ravenly feed the hood like I'm a fast food chain
No need to ever question why the hood love me
Got a aliens and vegetarians to feed you if you hungry

[Verse 2:   Canibus]
Debauchery
Ain't no peace in poverty
Keep watchin' me
Blow your ass up like [?]
Know the psychology
Nigga don't lie to me
Disaster strikes
Yeah that's prophesy
Theocratic liberal faggot right wing fascist
Democratic crack addict
Politics is a language
54th Street downtown
Maroon Lincoln Navigator
Music is loud, the usual crowd
The center of attention is where all the energy is directed
It's deceptive so I stand corrected
Top tier rated review
Same as you - say it ain't true
I put a nigga to shame in the booth
Difference between me and them
Fingerprints and dick size
Bad Leroy Brown Spaz like Spetznaz
Lumberjack on steroids
Break you off with my bare hands boy
Sledgehammer to the groin
So many ways to control the human animal
The strategy's to make the world more manageable
More or less best protect your neck, guard your chest
The war of attrition
Them niggas starved in the trench
Only the strong survive
You know the monster's always gonna try
Those with a conscience probably gonna die

[Hook]

[Verse 3:  Bronze Nazareth]

Hot tub
Hubs guard the watchdog
The watchdogs watch the socks boil
I got them ox tail plates and now you hailmarble top soil
Your plots foil like wetlands from onyx soil
I broil flocks
Smoke silver like an arctic fox
No bark but shots don't hard compress the rocks
Watch the target burn through your chestplate
Dextro metal face my scripts broke penetrate
Clicks go fist throat, separate wrist throat
Butterfly shank you lightweight
I lift scopes in a sworn ceremony
Master next lift ropes
Attorney stiff as soul cough as I row
To assist to lift your soul
Sift soul fragments of your skull
Detroit Piston man a place to Indiana brawl
Scuba dive a landing strip
Mess hall to balls in
Put 'em asleep since I'm slept on
Yes, ya'll

[Hook]

[Verse 4:  Block McCloud]
I'm the big conquerin' lion
From outta Mount Zion
My things is like two pins made from Wolverine iron
You had dreams I was down with the Mayans
I hunt witches, chop heads off Medusa
Can't block out McCloud, he a crazy producer
All my homies stay tight like me and my Hoovers
Bang out that's young nigga shit
I don't hang out
Might see me after ma saw Jimmy Kane house
I'm gifted stay away from wood
Niggas and safe bitches
Jesus feed your whole team with 2 fishes
The angel of rap destroyed demons and death wishes
Even my homeboy act very suspicious
Got team on the track
Little brother come get this
Mos Def would declare but I'm Common with kisses
And I'm 50 when it's time to get down in the ditches

[Hook]
