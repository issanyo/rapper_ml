[Verse 1: Canibus]
I pulverize MC's and blow up mics
From street corners to international websites
I'll run up on you and set it for no reason
My flows are like body-blows that cause internal bleeding
Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker, above average
With alien deoxyribonucleic acid
A blood spore, with metaphors of all sorts
So fly I need a pass port just to walk

[Verse 2: Rock (Ras kass)]
What the deal, baby?
I'll set it off while my people beat you upside the head
With lead from my desert eagle
Fuck how people treat you
Ain't got no time for your feelings
On tracks I'm revealin the facts that be concealed in
A book, cause most black niggas don't read
Got me thinking bout my sister and my new-born seed
See this world is filled with idiots (What are you, and idiot?)
Illiterate, inconsiderate, motherfuckers that's kickin the illest shit

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
I'll let two-thirds of this nigga that's water evaporate
Then I want Jesus Christ to evacuate
Fuck pullin a nigga's card
I want the deck and the dealer
Global monotomy, sodomy is my commodity
I see one bitch-ass nigga
Then my head blow like the Oddities
You emtpy T.V., I empty MC (Nigga)
Record industry rule numers one, two, and three
Jews run it, niggas run around in it, believe me

[Hook: (Rock) [Ras Kass] {Ruck​​}​ Everybody]
(Hip-hop belongs to us soldiers over here)
[Nah, hip-hop belongs to us niggas right here]
{​​Don't be a idiot, hip-hop's your heart over here}​​
So throw your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Verse 4: Rock]
Ya'll must think I'm stupid
But I know my shit
Just dollar smoke that makes me wonder like that robot bitch
Yo, watch this
Got this locked, try for the key
You get popped in the face like you're throwin fries up in hot grease
Rockness rips straight through toys
Got rappers jumpin through car windows like they Duke Boys
I told ya, this east-west is bullfit like a Pablo's
Philly's wherever I go until I blow trial, yo

[Verse 5: Canibus]
Canibus remains undisputed but never rooted
I'm strong enough to throw a bullet faster than a gun can shoot it
So if you try to battle me face-to-face
I'll bring your career to a stop quicker than anti-lock brakes
Look (look) inside the mind of a animal
That'll beat you to death with a bar of soap wrapped in a towel
And while you niggas is babblin
My lyrics is travelin
Like a javelin
To stab you in the abdomen

[Hook x2: (Rock) [Ras Kass] {Ruck​​}​ Everybody]
(Hip-hop belongs to us soldiers over here)
[Nah, hip-hop belongs to us niggas right here]
{​​Don't be a idiot, hip-hop's your heart over here}​​
So throw your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Verse 6: Ruck (Rock)]
Who want beef from vegetarian?
When we thump, your knees bump like a Kerrigan
The veteran, better than sick crews
Take your medicine, I can vic you
From the crib'll let him in
Keep your locks on
Son, I think the plot's on (With who?)
With the baby girl, yo, the bitch said her pop's gone (For real?)
Proceed to creep, du
There's no need to sleep, du, I'm nocturnal
Don't care about my where abouts, nigga, it don't concern you

[Verse 7: Ras Kass]
I got nigga's heads dividin faster than nerds at a calculus convention
See I school niggas, then I after-school niggas like detention
It's a chinch to bag bitches now
But I remember they was dissin when I was broke, I was good for nothing
Now I'm good for nuttin down them bitche's throats (Uh-huh)
Like Rock say (You'll get the bobway...)
So just say when
You got anything to get off your chest besides yo chin
This nigga spit like I was teething
Fuckin up more human beings than Europeans

[Verse 8: Rock]
Dutch boy, guard yo leg like I'm Barkley
Don't start me
I'll pull Sparsky
He'll rip apart three of you in a heart beat
In the dark we see like owls, bats, vampires
In a large tree
Ready to snipe that ass at warp speed
Launch torpedos
MC's know what they weak flows
We float and bounce on tracks like a goddamn speed boat
So slow yo ass down, no doubt
Don't be hasty face me
Or you'll be jettin diesel
Bench-pressin daisys
