[INTRO]

{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​VOICE 1}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
English translation is just a click away
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​VOICE 2}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
I know that our diversity
Our calamity we do not like...
{​​​​​​​Canibus}​​​​​​​
Rip the Jacker to infinity!
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​VOICE 2}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
...But without worst of calamity, there is no legacy. Without legacy, there is no legend.  Without legend, there is no infinity
{​​​​​​​Voice speaking in a foreign language.  The name "Uncle Sam" is uttered.}​​​​​​​

[Verse 1: Canibus]
And head safe to base, calibrate before I create
Completed the lyrical fortitude gate
Crash crew crash through the earth's fragile frequency gate
The first contact is frequently late
L-M-N-O-P is for pineal gland
The primitive probably impotent primordial man
Remains to be seen, suffering succotash
So extreme like Sharlee, I mean Charlie Sheen
Shall we shut the fuck up before I shoot you in the spleen
Speeding racing the six passenger SUV
On State Road 66, '67 Corvette 7-speed
The center of gravity is closer to me
To the ground to a centipede
Pick up the scent and proceed to the pantheon of perfect poetry
The father of creation's unique to the matrix
Metaphors are metallic millenium machinations
Of magnificent imagination
The magnum opus of the master Mason meditatin'
Mitigatin' emotion magnifyin' patience
Preparing for the moment when I pilot this spaceship
Transfigured emotions emulate modern and mediocre man's
Mistakes or misnomers
And there are many more mistakes to make
Matter of fact, from now on, all memos must mention
My lyrical law mandate startin' with the sideways 8 shape
I swear for the sake of the Great Saint
Motherfuckers will comply or get put in they place
DJ nice up the place with the new PLOO tape
How long did it take him to make?
How long did we have to wait for the RTJ interface
To intensify the interscape of infinite space?
Sound engineers escape to a peaceful inner place
In a pro campus who would dispace
The PLOO tape is in a blue case with original Zapruder tapes
I bought em in '88 from Black Zeus with the Zulu face
And this is proof that the doodoo ain't fake

Rip -Rip -Rip the Reptilian!

[Sample from Brainbender by DJ JS-1]
{​​​​​Kool Keith: I pitch it like that I switch it like that you mix it like that, man vs...}​​​​​

[Canibus]
...The Reptilian!

[Verse 2: Canibus]
How long did it take him to make
How long did we have to wait for the RTJ interface
To intensify the interscape of infinite space
Sound engineers escape to a peaceful inner place
How long...
Still can't fuck with me lyrically!
