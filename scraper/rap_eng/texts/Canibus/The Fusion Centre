[Intro: Canibus (Vinnie Paz)]
Yeah, Canibus, my man Vinnie Paz
(Louie Dog, Hannibal, Canibus, Vinnie Paz, yeah)
Yeah (Jedi Mind)

[Verse 1: Canibus]
An isolated regime that works twice the pace of your team
These Jedi Mind Tricks are no dream
Kill-code received, you do not need to know what you need
You will be uplinked to the feed
The entrance to the cave is guarded by a statue of Saint Germain
Holding an oil lamp with a purple flame
Shuffling down the dark corridor, chasing the voice of the orator
The light brightens more and more
Your muscles tight and sore
You fall to waist height then crawl as you are forced to recite bars
From Ars Notoria, what is the origin?
Metaphoric euphoria, lobotomize the audience
Rap music recruited, those who refuse it
Will be uprooted, then electrocuted, then executed
Flesh is fluid, physically it's a stretch to do it
You wake up cold, wet and wounded playing my music
The strong believe in me, the weak try to weaken me
But they are not allowed to speak to me that easily
The fans get neglected, can't get their favorite record
They only get to hear what's selected, not requested
They are wasting your time, just think about that
The reason you won't think is the reason I won't rap
Wisely worded speech, framing technique and thermal heat
Bridges the verbal to the beat, providing earth for your feet
I rip granite, the Universe shaped like this planet
Nobody understand it when my spit is mismanaged
Virtuoso Vivaldi, Aleister Crowley
With a baldy flow flawlessly, cathedral halls applaud me
Red-Three-Delta they call me, in the Red Army Armory
Talking softly, walking calmly, the officers saw me
Cursing at the bastard commie, pass the salami
Rhyming offbeat, they poured me caffeine, not coffee

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
You'll never hear nothing as evil as this
As this I carry desert eagles into the cathedral and lick
My people are sick your people unbelievably bitch
In Mogadishu counting money inconceivably rich
A feverish pitch, I'll hit you so you bleed where you piss
I feel sorry for any rapper think he equal to Bis
I see through the mist, I see you faggots weak in the wrist
I ain't rapping no more, Pazienza speak with the fists
I see the abyss but I ain't going there no more
I'm too old so I ain't licking in the air no more
Aiyo Bis who these motherfuckers that's thinking it's war
In '88 the only white boy spitting it raw
I kicked in the door, I spoke on metaphysics in awe
But they was too stupid to understand the vision involved
I wish that we all had platinum that could christen the wall
But I'ma ride for you regardless if it's business involved
