[Verse: Canibus]
You motherfuckers is so fake, you make me want to smash your whole face
Hit you so hard, my hand breaks, and my shoulder dislocates
You ever hear the sounds your bones make when they break?
It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates
Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank
Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ
Nigga you can't, and you shouldn't even try to
Half the square-root of my I.Q. is beyond you
So when you see me on the street, you better not say a mother fucking thing to me
‘Cause nigga, you pink pussy
I got some live niggas with me, with trigger happy fingers of fury
Put one in your skully, and five in your belly
‘Cause whenever rhymes fly, like bullets in drive bys
I catch them and throw them back, like Miami Jai Alai
I cop mine, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five
Three miss you, two hit you; one in the leg, one in the thigh
‘Cause Canibus was old school before niggas was talking about jewels
Before engineers was using pro tools
Make my own rules, no matter what I flow to
Start a vacuum in the mic booth the way my God damn tongue moves
Journalist, one time

(Canibus)
I'm probably what you would call a
Record industry population enforcer
I slaughter like, a hundred rappers each quarter
In order to keep this shit in order
I track wack niggas down, from border to border
Just like the stories of the hare, and the tortoise
The rabbit was faster, but fell asleep in the forest
But lost, ‘cause the tortoise had endurance
I always stay focused the longest
I promise I can battle any artist 'till they just get exhausted and forfeit
With actual, super-natural forces, I'm a horseman from Hell
Immune to the garlic water, and the crosses
After the last album, I went through a metamorphosis
And probably fired more of my niggas than Doug Morris did
I kicked the dead beats out, turned around and switched my whole team out
Now I got some banging ass beats now
It paid off, ‘cause I came off, like Adolf
And I can murder any God Damn camp I concentrate on
With the first strike, I'm so nice
I can exterminate more niggas than the Third Reich
The way I burn mics, I've been accused of neing all hype
