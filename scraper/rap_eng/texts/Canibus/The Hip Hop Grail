[Intro]
[Canibus]

Yo this is Canibus and I got my little young Rippers carryin' me - Architect and Reverse Polarity

[Tony Touch]

Yeah what's up it's your man Tony Touch
Chilling right here with my man Architect
Representing Reverse Polarity Studios
Down South Florida, you know what it is, man
Yo Arch
Killin with that yo
Production is crazy
Hit me with another one man (hit me with another one man)

[Verse 1: Canibus (in Jamaican accent)]

I roll up the spliff and go deal with the day
Nobody can tell Canibus what to say
I play what the fuck I wanna play
If we in the studio I'm gonna take a turn off the bass
The rhymes come through me the energy runs through me
Green Gran Turino hooky comes smellin like patchouli
I'm old school, the dudes do a loogie
Ya rhymes is booty
Ya attitude is over youtube
Your fingerprints on the fence
Take your glasses off, Clark Kent
You know where this starts, you know where it ends
You know where this goes my friend
I am not your friend?  That's good to know
Now you know who I am
Are you talkin to me or are you talkin to him?
I see you go for them talking about the lyrics you said
The day after liberty bled
Our freedom was dead but
Til then he said "Do everything that you can"

[Hook: Canibus]

Listen to me rhyme
My mind is brain cell beehive
M.I.A.M.I. samurais stockin' rhymes
Architect supplies the supplies
Eyes in the skies see everything guys
So divine I feel like I spoke to the overmind
1000 MCs mixtape Tony Touch style
Line up hip hop for sale
An old head hip hop tale
About the story of the hip hop grail
Spit it in detail (the story of the hip hop grail)
Lyrical detail  (the story of the hip hop grail)
You know we mean well  (the story of the hip hop grail)
Peace, be well  (the story of the hip hop grail)
Spit it in detail (the story of the hip hop grail)
Lyrical detail  (the story of the hip hop grail)
You know we mean well  (the story of the hip hop grail)
Peace, be well  (the story of the hip hop grail)

[Outro: Canibus]

Yeah Canibus Tony Touch on the set
Architect is the mixtape threat
Canibus Tony Touch on the set
Architect is a mixtape threat

[Coda: Sampled voice]

We have reached the end of our journey
It has taken us from east to west
But there is no real confusion to our story
The grail will forever be
As the lines are blurred between convention and reality
Fantasy and history
More than eight centuries after       were written
The quest for the Holy Grail goes on
