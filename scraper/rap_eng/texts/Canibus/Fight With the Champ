[Verse 1: Canibus]
You wanna fight with the champ? You bite with the vamps
You got gloves, you can dance? I got a mic in my hand
A red-blooded affair, nothing to fear
Every time this year we appear in the square
Get it on, get it in gear. He gettin' at you? Get him in here
We gon' have to get a couple things clear
The art is here, no matter what type'a armor the warrior wear
The story of glory brought me to tears
Mexicano, Chino, Gringo, Negro
To the head, to the body with the dumbbell deathblow
Do not let 'em go, cause I said so
We champions let's go, we all bleed red bro
