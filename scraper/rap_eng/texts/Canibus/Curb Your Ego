[Intro]
Alright fellas. Listen, let's get real this morning, you gotta kick the ego, to the curb. You just gotta get it, and kick it, and throw it to the side. The male ego has a tendency to create more damage, than good. And a lot of times, our ego, simply gets in the way

[Hook:  Seven Spherez]
Yo it's the murder prequel serving heat at the third degree, bro
You rappers need to stay in your lane, and curb your ego
Hurt the beat, burning MC's with the verbal free-flow
You rappers need to stay in your lane, and curb your ego X2

[Verse 1: Seven Spherez]
It's the ravenous rap savages, damaging wack amateurs
Trapped in a black cavern, the hazardous track ravellers
Snap on you cats, snack on you rappers that act fabulous
Backing Jack, when I flatten twats in their jacked amulets
Fantabulous, feel the wrath of these gas canisters
All you rappers with lax to the track landed with Canibus
Handle this biz right, spit light, like the hammer click
The only time you shoot with those cannons is snap camera pics
Rap vandalist, with his hand on the can, angling
Dangling off the building, revealing the craft's manuscript
Planning shit with candles, ripping anarchist with ganja lit
Popping tags, till I'm fucking drowning in Mandarin
Hand in the throne, battle your clique while I stand on my own
But rappers are running from me like I'm standing here banging the chrome
My hand when he strangle a clone
The seven we gang to the bone
Step into the cypher get beheaded like Ann Boleyn [?]

[Verse 2 | Canibus]
Aight, enough about him, let's talk about me
'cause every now and then I gotta speak my piece
I could curb my own ego and still get it off
When I walk I break off chunks of Himalayan salt
I receive my blessings from projecting my love
I'd rather do that than stain swords with blood
Easy-peasy rice and cheesy but don't get touchy-feely
Get punched in the neck for being greedy
My living quarters are cold with poisonous mold
Been living down here since zero years old
In the name of the Creator, I rose
Remove the millstone from my own neck bones, so i can spit what I wrote
In return, I was enhanced manifold and saw spiritual growth
For you to find out and for me to know
How I weld words together, separately plasma cut into letters
A ripper forever, nobody do it better
