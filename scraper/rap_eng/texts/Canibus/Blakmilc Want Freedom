[Canibus]
Hit the tune, shocked out, come but no further
Blakmilc's the name, domination's the purpose
And we don't give a fuck about rules, that's why we break 'em
If the devil was a rebel then you'd know what I'm sayin
Spokesman out in the open, pass the mic to me
I look around I see a whole lot of kids like me
If you could do one thing in this world, what would it be?
Would you rather be shackled in chains or fight to be free?
(I choose freedom!) When I wake up (when I wake up) and look around
And wonder how (I wonder how) can I get out
Get off to far (get off to far) beyond the gates
I jump then run (I jump then run) but I get chased
You can't escape (you can't escape) that's what they say
But I got away (I got away) and made 'em pay
For what they done (for what they done) to what I love
Hip-Hop rhymes over erratic drums
Blow your horns, here the cavalry comes
Blakmilc motherfucker and we fight 'til the tragedy's done
No matter where they be attackin me from
My heart pumps pure gasoline, and my eyes shine like the sun
Motherfuckers talk shit but they bums, I crush 'em like crumbs
Scream at the top of my lungs, that's what they want
This is Blakmilc baby, you never give up
Livin it up, I'm rapid-fire tearin shit up, what?
