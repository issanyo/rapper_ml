[Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine
In the beginning I made lyrics, now lyrics make me
You’re listening to Rip The Jacker II: Infinity
This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
Surround you with a layer to the left, to the right
To the front to the back, with a rap and a mic
For satellite rappers delight, you battle for your life
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
The cedar wood burns, my heating is rightfully earned
I take you on a journey through the words
In the mind, hold your hand with an infinite rhyme
For a time I know it makes you shy, but that’s fine
Come along with me, let me show you how hard it can be
To spit like the 100 Bar Beast
An extra large dosage of the dopeness
How can I be anything but focused as the spitbar soldier
The rhyme equity above quota
Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for
Walk around confused, listening to tunes
Music is my muse, Can-I-Bus this abuse?
Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones
Nah, I just work for him
I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime
For how it was remembered and seen
Mission requires a plan, armed personnel and staff
But tradition demands I be a more primitive man
Three standard 16s; fade the record at 3:35
Grim reaper axe, kick to your spine
Pound after pound, I come stomp on your brain
Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain

[Chorus x4: Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine

[Canibus]
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
That’s when you know your times up Germaine
Don’t forget you nice, you fit the right archetype
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
