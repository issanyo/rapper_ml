(Canibus)

The secret of the ages, I illuminate with logic
What I speak is more than just deep; it's bottomless
With common sense, I'm organized like crime and mafias
Plus the way I rhyme is prime, like Optimus
A rapologist, you could sit and do the knowledge with
From G.E.D.'s, to degrees, from Ivy League colleges
I politic with any magazine columnist
About topics other emcee's won't even bother with
Rock solid shit like stones and monuments
It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us
Closely, through a microscope and a pair of binoculars
Ghetto scholars like me, who study street calculus
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous

(Canibus)

I grab the tail of a comet, follow it to the apocalypse
Slow it down with my retro-rockets, until I stop it
Rhymes be like, unidentified flying objects
The positive, positive, beliefs in your self-conscience

(Canibus)

The devolution I bring is a diagrammatic enigma
I'm Monad, so I'll elucidate the stimulus
Somebody pass my diadem
You probably think that it's incubus
Because I'm an inimical epiphany
This is an epistolary symphony, seriously //
