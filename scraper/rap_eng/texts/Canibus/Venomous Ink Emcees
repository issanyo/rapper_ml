[Verse 2: Canibus]
I don't wanna die because I got left behind
Nobody can blame me though, my mind was on rhymes
Blindfold me - I flow blind, I spot a co-sign
I'm clear to take the shot but I need more time
Writing rhyme time, line for line, the mic's mine
Think I'm lying? Then buy out one of a kind
Mic-Nificent, enemy belligerent
Militant but innocent 'cause if I ain't armed I've got lyrics to spit
Nigga try to flip, I kick you in the dick
Punch you off the side of a cliff, handcuff you at the wrist
I don't know what's wrong Canibus
Who lives like this? The man never met the myth
Smoke piff, listen to Canibus dope shit
I hope I live to see the day they legalize this whole shit
Rhyme like nobody's business, kick your door in with Lyrical Fitness
I don't know who said to give you this
A manual from me to you, written as an itemized list
Sit down, open your mind, try this
I don't even think, goddamnit I make your brain cells swim
Take it from the top, let's do it again, I spit bars
