[Intro: Canibus]
Get ready for the Luminati tsunami!

[Verse 1: Luminati]
C4 ??? ???, eat meat raw, street dawgs, rip these off
And put C's on, had to ease off
From a show I just peed on
Bought a two-seater that I put 10G's on
Beat her cause she took my mother fuckin ring off
She took me to Supreme Court, and the judge got screamed on
They sent me up North, to a prison with a ???
All day long, lift weights we ??? ???
Meet King-Kong, Big Don, and Little Shawn
Murda One got big arms, he real strong
Beat his own mom cause she stole from the weed farm
Word on the streets, raw
Don't beef with Armstrong
Wrong season Lou crush anything he breathes on
Pass me the paper and pen, and put beats on
Rip rap songs, put down pads with facts from
From ArchivesMusic.com and that's a rap, son

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You mess with my horse, you dead as a corpse
Forget it, rhymes without ending
With infinite lyrics, fools you do get abused like broads
In a battle for truth with rhymes and metaphors
When my horse appears, count your prayers
Stab you in the ear, then pull out the spear
Watch the crowd cheer
Leave the floor wet with all the blood stains
So the audience knows the Canibus runs things
I rip down stages on many occasions
Dozen of broken down mics and melted tape decks
Everywhere I go, niggas wanna rob me
Bootleggers be in the front row trynaget a clear copy
So take caution 'cause I'm a horseman
And I'll snatch that ass up quick like "turn it off man"
So just acknowledge, the way that I'm gifted
Cause if rap was a felony, I'd be in prison
Hogging up the phone, cussin' at the C.O's
25 to life, with no parole
And battling me, you must be feelin' yourself
I rip the Jacker so hard, he might kill himself
Like his name was Todd or James, back in the dark days
It's like a pit bull getting bit by a Shar-Pei
I defend my horse, my men, my friends
My baby's momma and my offspring so bring it on then
So I can show you how I devour
Niggas like a rottweiler with acidic saliva
Step ya shit up nigga, the Ripper's much iller
'Cause when I write rhymes, I use the mind to pick the pen up
Most artists are garbage, no skills
They belong in a landfill, nobody feels
It when the grab the mic and start bragging about their massive ice
I can't eat MCs cause I lost my appetite
I'm a beast, you a midget with wack lyrics
Like Dr. Evil said (quiet, shut up, zip it)
I reign superior, my metaphors are scarier
Non-ill rappers, you better evacuate
Before I exfoliate your face
With abrasive phrases to give your face a face-lift
Germainespit insane shit
So stop hating if you can't applaud me and give rap music the glory
