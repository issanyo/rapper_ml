(Canibus)
"Space Invaders," with red, gold, and green lasers
The Sith Lord with the black light lightsaber
"Lawnmower Man," Rhyme Project 5
Building paradigms outside the present timeline
Step to you, step through you
The brutal Zulu pursue you, in a souped up Subaru
With the roof removed, tactical view greatly improved
180 degree cupola, move
Spin around send a 2-Oh-3 round down range
WIA from a frag grenade
Metaphors so raw, they put burglar bars on my jaws
That's the only way I can talk
OG's quote me and don't even know me
They donate the proceeds, I smoke trees
I'm the Ghost Rider sitting on the chopper
My face like a coal miner mixed with Chewbacca
Black Hawk chase Sasquatch on a fast horse
Gotta get to hangar 18 â€˜fore they blast off
Crawl in the desert, to make your knees tender
Warfare for the gods' ears they respect it
Spectacular thug, drink Dracula blood
Your attack was overrun, pass me a gun
Textures, colors, smells, tastes, temperatures
Sounds, dimensions, aesthetic impact signatures
Course, fragrant, bright, chemical bitter
Triangular, metallic, silver, unfamiliar
I'll kill ya!
