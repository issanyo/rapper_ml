(Some funny mothefuckers Hahahaha)

Yo, ayo I got to the city holla'd at Pete
(Yo Bis whats the dealie wha up wit da philly)
Ain't nothing really I was about to call Billy
You got some Henny
(Na i got some Remy, couple of broads they acting friendly)
(Yea I brought ab thru)
Grab a broom cold smash and loops
(Yo later that day we gathered round for a class A instruction)
Grap a mic and start bustin
Yo its a cold cold world that's what I keep say
On the stoup loaded the barrel
The microphone is the bow the flow is the arrow
The fact is the truth your head is a melon bash the fruit splatter your juice
Picture apple gets axed in two thats you
(Maybe in a outfit or the necklace go head Bis)

This goes out to the motherfucker that stole my rhyme book
Let me tell ya what design you took
Ya got a piece of batch 14 article 3
I hope you have a good time its a remarkable read
It can make you marketable indeed
You now got ya hands on the secrets of a master MC
Personalized print extra wide script so my eyes dont squint
My mind thinks smoke rise through the vent
Try to rework the theory but the logic is thin
I possess the body of jin with a fight klub win
Maybe its just a mic club thing fuck a sling
You could duck a swing i spit webs duck one of them
My fingerprints on your soul when I touch a pen
We interact when you memorize the raps
Identify fast syntax applied with stats
When I open my mouth its like sliding back the bolt
No joke leave a hole in you was an insult
You better check the wind direction when I talk
Before and after somewhere in between I blast ya
Rhymes on deck check the chart specs
Light yo ass up it ain't even dark yet
