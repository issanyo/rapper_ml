[Canibus]
Yo, yo, You motherfuckers is so fake
You make me want to smash your whole face
Hit you so hard my hand breaks and my shoulder dislocates
You ever heard the sounds your bones make when they break?
It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates
Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank
Then bite you with poisonous fangs
For trying to fuck with the champ
Nigga you can’t, and you shouldn't even try to
Half of the square root of my IQ is beyond you
So when you see me in the street, you better not say a motherfucking thing to me, cause, nigga, you pink pussy
I got some live niggas with me, with some trigger happy fingers of fury, put one in your skully and five in your belly
Cause whenever rhymes fly like bullets in drive-bys
I catch them and throw them back like Miami Jai-Alai
I cock mines, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five
Three miss you and two hit you, one in the leg, one in the thigh
Now you're on the floor immobilized
Screaming that you never wanted to die ’till I put one in your eye  Cause Doo Wop was old school before niggas talked about jewels Before engineers was using Pro Tools
Make my own rules no matter what I flow to
Start a vacuum in the mic-booth
The way my motherfucking tongue moves
Type of shit that make niggas disgruntled
Charged enough to jump to, go outside and bust their guns to
We the Bounce Squad outlaws, we about what we out for
In the beast's belly you can't have peace without wars so fuck 'em all
