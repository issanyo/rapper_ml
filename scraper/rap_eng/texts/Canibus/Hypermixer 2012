[Canibus]
God is my Father, Apollo is my friend
I humbly ask that they spare me the strength
I always do my best, even when I can't, I'm spent
Did a 100 Bars off the bench
Original content, we are still at the base of the mountain
Red, white and blue hard hat helmets
Green black and red standard shouldee lepel kit
Rakim said, "This is '86' nastalgic"
Dark ___ slate, polished to reflect the face
Of a man that lived less than great
An old Indian giver who lives by a dirty ass river
They called me a dirty ass nigga
I cleaned my room and said, "How's that? Better?"
Rap style whatever, tougher than cow leather
Airlifted it to the albatross from the Tibetan mountain top
I’ll be back when the next album drops

7 hundred and 77 shopping marketing stickers
Pandora versus Spotify, that a whole hell a lot of rhymes
Identical to the service I provide
What’s the audible particle count? How many books you authoring now?
No book, just an album coming out
The what, when, why and how?
Will ultimately be up to the consumer who buys it now
