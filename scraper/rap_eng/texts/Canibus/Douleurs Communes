(Canibus)
I swoop from behind, chew into your spine
Nice as Ol'Kainry and produce another line

(Canibus)
When the God appears, let him through
We spit terrible decibels, that level you like September eleventh do
The five-bar general
Medals of Honor from shoulder to shoulder, salute me when I'm next to you

(Canibus)
Step into the booth, I'ma rip you in two
Persona, none grata, like Dennis Hopper
Hollywood actor, slash hip-hopper, spit proper
Whip a modern styled Benz with the brahmas
Then watch Notre-Dame Depatis, the French Opera
Ninety-one districts, spit sick shit
Trap the fish in my fishnet with this shit //
