[Canibus - Hook]

Yo...Yo...You can lick shots in the club, I don't give a fuck who you hit!
(It's Logic! As long as it's nobody that's in my clique!)
Yo! You can catch a nigga at the stoplight, and snatch him out the whip!
(It's Logic! As long as it's nobody that's in my clique!)
Check it! If a bitch got AIDS I don't care who she sleeps with!
(It's Logic! As long as it's nobody that's in my clique!)
Yo! You can even admit, you know who the gay rapper is!
(It's Logic! As long as it's nobody that's in my clique!)

[Canibus - One Verse]

I'm the greatest scientifically inclined mind since Einstein
I write blue ribbon rhymes for Nobel Prize time
Tryin' to shine with the shit I invent
I know I ain't perfect, but I'm 99.9 percent
Which means I represent
And get deep in thoughts with philosophies
Like a rolling stone gathers no moss
At any and all costs, M.C.'s get flipped, ripped, split
And tossed with lyrical brute force, of course
Y'all niggas is microsoft like DOS
Fuckin' wit' me you'll catch a free round trip to the morgue
Cause I ain't scared of none of y'all
Word to Allah
We can go to war, with four-four's, or swashbuckle with swords
Intoxicated off the La-La
On some Rah-Rah
I'll blow your stereo the fuck up if it ain't a Hi Fi
Lyrical scholar
In the physical form of Allah
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the Blah-Blah-Blah!!!
With the knowledge of my forefathers
You niggas can't battle me because I'll quadruple my brain capacity
The intellectual ath-e-lete accurately rapping so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
I happily accept any rapper's offer to challenge me
Fifty M.C.'s reduced to forty nine casulaties
I'll be the last man standing
With metaphors a charlie horse couldn't put a cramp in
It's the Canibus gettin' busy with Tony Touch
The fuck that I don't even give a fuck about, don't give a fuck...what?!
