Don't play them games, not for play, not today
Say what you say, not for play, not to day
We horsemen man, you fools insane, locked the game
We spit flames, not for play, not today

[Kurupt:]
Each day I dip sometimes I trip
This gangsta shit (west gangsta shit)
I just don't give a fuck
I gallop role I'm in control
I like gettin high in G mode
With the homeys just lettin all the weed blow
Fired up, nigga what you thought it was
Buz cause nigga I don't give a fuck

[Canibus:]
Niggas like us don't give a fuck
Canibus and Kurupt, choke a nigga up
Comin through in the four by four truck
Chromed from the flour up, with [?]
White air force ones with the low cut
I'm in the back of the jeep gettin toe-up
Me and my dawg Kurupt spark that skunk
I know I'm a G cos' my name start with one

[Hook: Kurupt & Canibus]

Start that buzz, thats wots up
Spike the punch, fight and fuzz
Rush that stage for the mic and bus
Straight up cause I love them guts
Don't call me unless you invite some sluts
36C cup with big butts

She can spit it up, then lick it back up
Thank you very much, there you go slut
A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough
Write your number down ill be in touch
