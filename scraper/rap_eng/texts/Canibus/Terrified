[Verse 1: Canibus]
Tora Bora, red feather in the fedora
The house of Hominid Horus are right before us
They squirmed around, in is blood until it started to make sense
It was done, the NSA put the prints on his gun
Planetary ancillary forces from humanitarian sources
30 years ago Val Valerian taught this
The watchman climbed aboard the flying Scotsman in Scotland
Operation not yet shut off the net
Flight carriers, terminal delta
Passenger name Mandela Nelson, exit row seat, helter skelter
Ford Vader MKUltra [?] in the skyscraper elevators
Stingray locators and mercury detonators
Retrofitted with solar cells, nano cell motionless gel
Nucleated sunlight, sun-up to sundown
Put the gun down what you want now, hands up on the ground
Binocular eyepiece around the sweaty brow with one round
One kill, no sound, suppress, sonic was slowed down
To the point that you don't even know this is sound
Left, right, red light through infrared sight
Goodnight. remember don't let the bedbugs bite
Sleep on the floor, hot cocoa, cold night for a fortnight
I studied the old man calendar the my whole damn life
Call it the dog paw, claw back claws, the dark side of the law
Holocaust get caught in the Singapore trapdoors, 24
