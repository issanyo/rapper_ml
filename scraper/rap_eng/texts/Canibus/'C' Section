This is the 'C' Section, ripping and wrecking
The lyrical legend sending y'all to Mic Club heaven
This is the 'C' Section
A lyrical legend, second to none in this profession

[Verse]
I spit it exquisite and rip it minute by minute
I'm in it to win it, you fucking rhyme with Bis you finished
Lyrical menace scrape enamel off your teeth like a dentist
With a sedative administered from the executive senate
Poor progression followed by metaphorical methods
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing, testing
Supreme supremacist nemesis to competitors
Predators eat intestines of anything they interested in
Slice you like lettuce and celery start seven
Then make an MC salad out of suckers and sell it
For an expensive percentage with nine tenths of the credit
Drink Red Bull beverage to increase lyrical leverage
I only give respect to Mic Club members and my own mentors
In the center of my circle where I dare you to enter
This is art imitating life imitating art
Imitating the brain simulating thoughts when I talk
Idealistically I spit for free
The stenography of the rhyme is what balances me, challenges me
EA-6B Prowlerss, superior air power
Will fly around us with propulsion that's soundless
Spitting rhymes out by the thousands
Nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue calm me down a bit
Attitude - cynicism and lassitude
Battle you? Come on dude, I should slap you fool
Spit what, I'll leave your lips numb the friction is so sick son
Your chin'll disappear from attrition
Rhythmic high intensity conflict is a given it
Especially if Canibus is doin the rippin
You snipping to clipping in the C-section incisions
With scissors with rubber ergonomic grip for the fingers
Liars for hire with a defense like Geoffrey Fieger
And rock it like thugs who work for Mic Club
Hyped up, tear the mic up my man
And move forward as expeditiously as I can
Ain't nobody in the world like Bis
The nitrous with radio telescopic devices, same type shit
Facially hairless, a gregarious Jamaican-American
Lyricist turned microphone terrorist
Airlift me off the front line to my therapist
So I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this
This is what they want, this is what they love
To engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs
While I'm in the cut satellite tracking you rappers
With months of food rations beneath the Catacombs of Paris
Theories of super-lattice and super-savage
Atomic attack tachometers flash when I punch the gas bitch
The farther I climb the harder I rhyme
You gotta face death and survive to feel more alive
The quality of life is an illusion of the mind
Super-imposed lines look two-dimensional from the side
According to the science of the C-section applied
If they say I'm the best after I die - don't be surprised
I C-section the sky let my energy rise
At the moment of truth I know it's definitely my time
As my soul is eased through the sieve I'll be grateful because I lived
The only drawback is that I didn't have kids
To C-section my beautiful wiz
And see the resemblance of my face in hers or his
Who knows what the future will bring, it stresses me to think
This mic meant everything now it doesn't seem important
Now I gotta follow orders, defend borders
From Maine to California, Seattle to Florida
If I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her
I'd speak to her about my passions
As the hourglasses turn and my life passes
I'll just wait 'til I see the Master and I'll just ask him
Forget it, that's the future, this is the present
A message to anybody listening to the C section
