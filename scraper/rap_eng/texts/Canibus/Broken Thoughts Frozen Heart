Inside the detox box I watch the clock
Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop
The physician of weirdness, bald and beardless
Only the minds of the independent can hear this
Civilian population fear this
Only authorized personnel beyond this point, where this?
The hypercube room I don't know where it is
Microphone terrorist bare fist with brad tips
Fuck with the Brass Monkey
Look up when honey's ass is above me
She a high class rap junkie
She's headless, with her face emplaced in her chest
Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch
The snake eats the canary
They issued an order not to come near me
No matter how bad I sound when they hear me
Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof
And land on both tubes so don't move
Pounce teams listens to Al Green
Everybody in town dreams
That they saw the same cloud screen
The Majestic Mic Master Messiah
Kappelmeister the rhyming meat grinder
Code Name: Shadow Viper
Metalic hawk talons knock sharks off balance
Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish
Everyday that goes by I feel less important
If I'm right, I'll be nonexistent by the morning
Don't you spit 'One More Bar'. once barred
You may not stand for ten years or more are you sure?
Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time
'Til I'm face to face with Optimus Prime
'Bar War' rap in the Temple of Karnak
The wolf has no constituent need to bark back
Put your ear to the phone, it takes them three seconds
To pronounce the true casualty rosters' death tones
Rocket propelled bars from a Alaska's largest national park
Where helicopters crash in the dark
The eagle was a phoenix, the phoenix is a zenith of a greater meaning
You are reading what I'm seeing
Lyrically theoretically I'm Schiaperrelli
The meaning behind Cydonia is so interesting
'Old Man of the Mountain' from New Hampshire
Says fire, live free, or die or retire
C-c-cold Leopold his whole bottom row solid gold
He possess all knowledge known
The verse I write is manufactured thermite
Spore bearing life forms come to life on the mic
Perigee and Apogee, your rhymes trapped in my gravity
Something that we understand naturally
Un-improvident talking prominent got full armament
Bomb parliament Big John was a big part of it
