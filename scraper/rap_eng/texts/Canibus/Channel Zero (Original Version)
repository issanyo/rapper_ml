[Verse 1]
The location is planet Earth
The time and date is nineteen, ninety-nine, December thirty-first
Eleven fifty-nine, P.M
The anticipation of what I think's about to happen got my heart beating
We got less than a minute left before
The planet Jupiter is ignited into a star
I know it sounds bizarre, but it's mathematics
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants
Those who understand, know what I'm saying is accurate
Our country is corrupt, from the president to the cabinet
In the year two, followed by three O's
The space probe Galileo will welcome us all to channel zero //

[Verse 2]
The secret of the ages, I illuminate with logic
What I speak is more than just deep; it's bottomless
With common sense, I'm organized like crime and mafias
Plus the way I rhyme is prime, like Optimus
A rapologist, you could sit and do the knowledge with
From G.E.D.'s, to degrees, from Ivy League colleges
I politic with any magazine columnist
About topics other emcee's won't even bother with
Rock solid shit like stones and monuments
It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us
Closely, through a microscope and a pair of binoculars
Ghetto scholars like me, who study street calculus
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous
The key to knowledge, is guarded by angel locksmiths
Who travel across the Universe, in flying objects
Secrets deadly to man, is dioxin
We sparring with God, our arms are too short to box with
Four thousand years before Christ, in the times of Pharaoh
Welcome to Channel Zero

[Verse 3]
Yo, dangerous minds, manufacture dangerous rhymes
Signs from revelations predict, perilous times
In the year two-thousand, the planets will be in alignment
Only the wisest, will survive it
The Earth will experience, a sudden change in climate
Killing many organisms in our environment
The earthquakes destined to happen in California
Will trigger the Brevard Fault in Atlanta, Georgia
The collapse of roads, bridges, and buildings
The death, of millions of innocent civilians
The Freemasons will control the nation
But you don't hear me though, it's the information
