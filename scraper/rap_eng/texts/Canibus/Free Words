Canibus the continuous, deciduous lyricist
A menace to music that's mastered every style that I spit
A fugitive against the music biz, the damage is punitive
But the truth is that my communitive efforts got 'em pissed!
Silence is golden, a sign that my knowledge is growing
I'ma show 'em, fuck the promotion
These poems open door for the chosen
In these moments of economic erosion
The global economy's broken, cause our leaders control it
They say we owe them but everything that we own has been stolen
So don't be mad at the soldiers, you follow orders too, don't you?
You never make a difference being a voter
The are the controllers, you just a warm blooded promoter
You're just a pea in a pod, with the need to believe in God
But God don't need guns or bombs
You need freedom to be oppressed, knowledge for the intellect
Positive effects what come out of our common respect
All colors, all creeds all kinds, all breeds
One law, one love, if we want world peace
It all starts with being still
But being still long enough to feel but being real enough to follow your will
