[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I've been dealing with hate since 1998
I punished the industry by dominating mixtapes
None of y'all can stop the onslaught of those bars
Rainfall and fireballs fell from the stars
The speech pattern of God, I ripped off weak rappers jaws
Whoever ignored Lyrical Law
Hip Hop didn't understand it at all, they couldn't manage my thoughts
So I retreated to the land of the lost
Don't talk about beats, talk about bars
Canibus so raw that rejection is your only response
Give a fuck if I sell one unit
Cause that was never the motivation for me to do this, stupid
I've already proved it
Now I must prepare for my posthumous interview with the vampire druids
That are coming to relieve me of my fluids
Believe me I'm the truest, that's why they can't stop my music

[Interlude: Professor Griff]
The coming casteless slave society
Obviously the government lied to me
The Illuminati's kidnap of Hip Hop is plain to see
Dead or alive you heard it from the Can-I-B

[Verse 2:Canibus]
Yo, I will not forsake the light, you can not force me to fight
I will always pay the ultimate price
Whether I am wrong or whether I am right
I've been a martyr all of my life, my archetype talks to the mic
I eat emcees on behalf of Iron Mike
I'm a fireball of the night, an extra-terrestrial airstrike
Call me on Skype tonight, we can talk if you like
I denounce fear like Steven Greer and his wife
Subject matter sound barely connected
Even when it's understood, it's rarely respected
The evidence is staring directly at the detective
Alex Jones left me a message saying I won't be accepted
Now, who's the skeptic?
The Melatonin Magik Deception
I will never be available for questions, get the fuck out my session
I've learned my lesson, media suppression is a weapon
They fucked up Hip Hop's progression

[Interlude: Professor Griff]
Yes
Melatonin Magik, Melatonin Magik
Melatonin Magik, Melatonin Magik

[Verse 3: Canibus]
How many emcees must get dissed
Before somebody whispers, "don't fuck with Bis?"
My Survival Skills surpass Kris, watch this
You got a rap for every emcee? Go get it, then!
Why you dickride Def Jam? They not your friend
Make your mind up, I thought you was not with them?
Fucking comedy, speaking on flawed philosophies
You'll never give props to Keith and Canibus for Undergods release
Go right ahead, dismiss it
We ain't submissive, we spit lyrical lyrics
I got the right of to live off it, I live it
And I'ma voice my opinion, can't nobody make me think different
My spirit feels like it's in a prison
I speak on the music conspiracy but nobody wanna listen
I talked about this shit years ago
I told my family if they kill us don't be scared to go
