[Intro: Canibus]
Hi, people ask me what is Lyrical Law
In its most original form
Lyrical Law was just a language that I used
To describe various components of lyrical fitness
And that was all
Then they said they wanted me to break that down
'Cause I made that style
So that's why I'm makin' this now
I'ma show you how, stay with me

[Hook: Canibus]
2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact is a self generated effort
2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact is a self generated effort
First lesson, check it, 2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact is a self generated effort
2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact with a higher power is a message
I said it, all contact with a higher power is a rare credit
Only angels on the guest list

[Chorus: Urban Rose]
We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
Because when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe
So much stress on your chest that you gotta buckle to your knees
Our lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage
We don't give a fuck, we gonna scream it anyway

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, Lyrical Law flow open the hyper-dimensional window
The code is a node unbeknownst
Lightening bolts that branch out fangs to the throat
You can't speak on the truth cause you're a mainstream ho
From the dirt floor in the hut to the mansion on stilts and struts
They're alive but they haven't lived much
It's almost time to get in touch, they will whine and discuss
This is for their own good, Canibus
Hip Hop, what a rush, turn sucker MCs to slush
Such and such and such and such
Enough, none of them was hits, they was near miss
I ain't talking about that, I'm talking about this
2012, classified patents
Only the first couple of thousands got to do with rapping
I've been rapping since rap happened
Half of y'all rappers is tap dancing the other half of y'all is lap dancing
That 'Man in the Mirror' laughing at the 'Melatonin Magik'
Yeah, they all laughing till the Spaceships landed

[Urban Rose]
Sorrow leads the way
Always broken with their wicked minds
They're falling away
Cause there is no truth within their eyes
No place, no place to go

[Verse 2: Canibus]
But not you Canibus, your sorrow will be your advantages
But you must control how to channel it
4th dimensional shifts are sandwiched
Between this reality and a 5th dimensional rift
The teacher doesn't talk in anaglyphs
But you misunderstand Canibus, Hip Hop gave him the chance to exist
The most advanced lyricism ever spit
And all they keep talking about is some stupid random shit
Just talk about the good, stop talking 'bout the bad
Cause other peoples business will beat your ass
Somebody new showed up and we don't like him
They bathe in human corpse dismembered to their liking
And all I'm doing is rhyming, that's not violent
I'ma shut up, to deactivate this bomb we need silence
Knowledge, is the reason that we bleed violet
The Leaders acknowledge this in private
They are the watchers of the prophets
Post Apocalyptic, must stop it
Fear is not an emotion, fear is not an option
They paralyze your motor skills, I could live without it
You call that a thrill? I doubt it

[Chorus: Urban Rose]
We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
Cause when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe
So much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees
Our lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage
We don't give a fuck, we gonna scream it anyway

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Steel cables repel downward to inner mountain
Look around it, Sasquatch is on my next album
The savage looking for salvage, not talk about them, talk about us
There's probably only a thousand left
Lyrical Law's your only outlet
Get out while you still can and forget about it but don't doubt it
I water the garden, the metal growing out the ground hardens
My lyrics give me presidential pardon
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe
This Law is the mortar between stones
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe
We are one Soul in separated zones
We control our souls and the microphones
That control the sound waves that this Law exposes

Lyrical Law has eleven new medics
Every concept seem separate
But all contact is a self generated effort
2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact with a higher power is a higher message
