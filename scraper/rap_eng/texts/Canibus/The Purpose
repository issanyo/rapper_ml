(Hook)
Billions, Canibus, whats the purpose?
We underground warriors beneath the surface
If you want Hip-Hop then we at your service
My soul is my own and its not for purchase

Billions, Canibus, whats the purpose?
We underground warriors beneath the surface
If you want Hip-Hop then we at your service
My soul is my own and its not for purchase

(Canibus)
Distraction is a device that tried to destroy my life
I was forced to find purpose on the mic
I pulled away from the dark towards the light
But the gravity attracts me the more that I fight
Billions of souls trapped between the negative and positive poles
I watch most people become what they loathe
The omniest poet with knowledge of the Hip-Hop culture
Billions of verses my purpose is my focus
Battle hand over to commander super-soldier
Commander kush captain cold crush supernova
Colder than Charles Manson getting open heart surgery in Anchorage Alaska
Rip the Jacker!
James Bond you belligerent bastard, drive faster
If you wanna save Jasper from those bloody assassins
Head-on collision crashes 'll knock you off axis
Sharpen my axe, practice, survival group classes
I learned about C4 plastics
Before the B2 bombers wuz ordered to drop bombs on the masses
My spit is like acid, I melt metallics
Furious, fluoro, antimonikable, who's braggin'?
Paper money papyrus, burn it and trash it
It's twenty-twelve, call me no cash Onassis
The American dream
The greedy will be buried with they cream and there is no in-between
My windpipe is a weapon machine, whatever you need
Tsunami flow from seven seas that'll never recede
Rap music was created by a deep rooted passion to prove it
Corporate are losers and counter-conducive to winnin'
When they call you a loser, I don't chew beats I abuse 'em
Then leave you with a billion bruises, stupid
