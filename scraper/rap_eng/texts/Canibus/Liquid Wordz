It's very difficult to know if...
Northerners are puppets, or...
They are innocent, or...
They are the masterminds

[Canibus]
These are 'Liquid Wordz'

Yo, I come through on cold steel on back of the snowmobile
I just came back from shogun hill
Make you kneel, face the wall
Shoot you in the back of the head with some paint balls
'Til your brains are gone
Attack dog, attack man, only respond to German commands
Completely bite off the burglar's hands
Triangle of death, that's where I purchased the land
Built the ranch, drilled deep into the Earth through the sand
Send the clergy emissary to the cemetery
You requested to be buried, with your bones to carry
I'm blood sample savvy, I name your first clone Jerry
Your second clone Harry, and your third clone after me
The fourth clone could battle him after he battles me
But your fifth clone can only be used as cattle meat
This is called microphone savagery
Press play, I attack the beat, you will tap out or tap delete
But we do not have to beef, before the Greeks captured Crete
I was known as the master of the beat
Sidonian MC speak, rudimentary speech
I released the Canaanite beast and sent 'em to the East
To walk through the streets sharin' thoughts about God and my beliefs
'Heavy Mental' it was authored by the Priest
We were tortured by the palm trees in the Palm Sunday breeze
It was 001 A.D

Yo, it's been a long time comin', but I'm finally here
Solidify my spot and I ain't gon' nowhere (C'mon)
Cause Ripper Mics been only 'vice
So I return like Christ, to resurrect the art of spittin' nice
The true and livin' it, physical form
Grab the mic and I - spit up a storm
Tracks get beasted, MC's get eaten
I blast paragraph from rough draft - the thesis
With strong facial features, lip and gap teeth's
I see through your feces like telekinesis
Build with Killah Priest in the chamber of Gizas
Special Ops Hip-Hop get chopped in pieces
Zero degree Celsius liquid will freeze
But at any temperature, settle melt MC's
That's why Canibus handed me the scrolls for infinity
What he actually gave me was the moment of clarity
It's complex simplicity, self-contradictory
Philosophical speak about the God and men mystery
Cause we've been fooled by religion and history
Cause the path to eternity, starts eternally
Accordin' to the sundown, the time is at hand
For me to reveal to man, exactly who +I Am...+
I'm the apostles, we writin' The Bible and Ebonics
I'm Elijah Muhammad that'll sell chronic
Martin Luther with a German Lugar
I'm Malcolm X on your project steps bustin' a tec
Gandhi with a MPC, who MC mad nice
I'm Christ in his cipher shootin' dice

[Killah Priest]
Inside my mind is bad weather
So when I brainstorm it'll rain strong
To Hurricane's swarm in a form of paragraph
Start from the corners of the pages in my pad
And nothin' could withstand the rhyme, when it rages in its path
But I don't brainwash my listeners
My lyrics give 'em a bath, without bars or soap
These are bars of quotes, that'll take you so far you'll choke
What I have is like lightening in a bottle
Deep as the writin' of Aristotle
Like Picasso but it's a novel
Spittin' in bars and flows, Priest the dark Dragon King
Spittin' graphics of scenes, my sixteens should be seen on plasma screens
My black wings are Lord of the Rings
While my sword is bathin' and y'all scream
Swallowed your flesh to his metal intestine
It feeds so much on your rebels that it became congested
And gnarls on bones, snarls at thrones, carve out domes
Somewhere in a giant stone King where the interest is big enough
To accommodate a Pterodactyl in flight
Priest sit and the Tabernacle will write
While Jackals fight over the poison Emperor's body
Priest and Canibus enjoy their memorable armies
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

[Canibus]
A lyricist without with no master, and no financer
After the disaster I will die from laughter
Alright, let's move out people
I got a five ton diesel for the illegal Hazmat retreat
Too deep to say peace to
I pray about peace for you
Very soon the Goetia will eat you
The keys of Solomon will open the door to that bottomless prison
And let Leviathan's army in
'Liquid Wordz', spit superb
From the foothills of Zagros to the streets of New Jerz
NewARK, I'm the rear admiral in New York
If I'm caught they'll award the posthumous purple heart
Navy cross never say we lost, damn, Abramoff is in court
'One Ought Not To Think' any thoughts, +Liquid Wordz+
