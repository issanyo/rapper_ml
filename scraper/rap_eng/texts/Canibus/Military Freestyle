[Verse: Canibus]
Who writes the song? I write the song
Rhymes accelerate through the cyclotron at nine microns
Turn the mic on, regurgitate the windpipe bomb
The opposite of a black lung is a white one
Can I bust in ya face? Shrapnel free concussion grenades
Mammalian diving reflexes undulating under the waves
Got something to say? Come to the cave , stick ya head in
I bring a new meaning to the phrase 'dead end'
A totally tumultuous tragedy
You battle me, I perform rhinoplasty with surgical savagery
Wield the axe with more gravity than Agassi
Crack ya teeth till your mouth sound like a tambourine
You think I'm overrated? I'm nauseated
I'm the living creation of the equation Minkowski formulated with an automated overbite
Quick as a Carnard Wing Shinden Prototype
When I'm holdin' the mic, nigga, who write the song?
I write the song, motherfucker
