Verse 1:  Canibus

Yo
I might be late, but I overcompensate
In hip hop my spot too hot to try to take
Motivated the flow (hated?) celebrated MC
Incredible breakout speed to take you out, G
From the 19th planet on the 38th moon
To a tabernacle womb with 38 tombs
The Holy Law of metaphor I'm so raw
I spit bars there's no way to remember it all
Only human but I spit super Rick Rucker
To protect my future just like you would, nigga
You under house arrest, still ain't listened
To my album yet, you ain't never gettin' outta debt
Til I come through and mash up the set, win the bet
This is it, I'm the best, how much you wanna bet
Niggas push out they chest like they ever beat a vet
Zero respect, don't even know how to lead the men
Here I am again, the alchemical architect
With my nigga Dee Dalimbless spittin' Syntex
Where you at, Dee? I'm right next to you G
MC Canibus Architect of Alchemy
