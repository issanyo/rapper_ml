[Intro]
Request permission to engage
Roger that, uhh we have no personnel east of our

[Verse 1: Greydon]
Fear monger in the government propaganda
Churches try to scurry up offerings for their santa
Hip-hop became a language but got lost in the grammar
They tried to take the music and cut it with Arm & Hammer
(It's dope) (They tried to make it crack?)
Well it's time to take it back
Make em responsible for what they say on the track
And if it's whack, we attack
It's as simple as that, entering through the back
Clear the room full of traps
A military underground assault team to liberate rap
Has already been dispatched in fact
A whole new batch is hatched, gremlin style
Pardon me as I catch my breath, it's been a while
While you calling me insane
Some bible-thumping psycho shot her son at the shooting range
Who's to blame?
Extensively military trained like Major Payne
Post-traumatic stress syndrome fresh on the brain
Only in the streets they notice us when we speak
Make decisions on the flow, but don't go with us overseas
And get none of the over patrols or IEDs
Engaging the enemy firing behind the trees
Even verbally ambushed by real MCs

[Verse 2: Canibus and Greydon]
Globally unique, the Beast is about to breach
Canibus and Greydon spit speech that's too deep
Peace, brohan comes hold hands with the old man
Imma show you how Hip Hop got me programmed
War Porn, why the fuck is it important where Obama was born?
Shit, cuz racism got us locked at the horns
Ready to fight for the colored man's birthright
Dark energy light up the night like thermite
Do not talk keep eyes on I4 in case shit pop off
The fuel truck just got topped off
This is day two hundred and two, still got a broken AVU
Report back with a tactical overview
CVC ID teams, 3D thermal screens
Target emcees who move between shrubs and trees
Track the migratory patterns of three quarters of the Earth's rappers
Mass disaster leave the whole planet grassless

[Verse 3: Greydon]
Savage, the super gross and Rip the Jacker
Closed perimeter, get too close and we'll attack ya
My whole unit's trained to be ghosts, bodysnatchers
Combat, we can boast the sum
We done fought the [?] toe-to-toe and won
Now they expect us to fold and run?
For making fun of they chosen one?
Let's see what happens when them soldiers come
Toward madness, in the sand, just more havoc
More action from hardcore rappers with war patches
What's the soldier's creed? I know it backwards
You should tell every vet you know you honor us in the highest fashion
As soon as you pass him
This is the message I want to get out to the masses
They confiscate, hide, and mask it
Eyes-only portfolios and packages
Films of our missions depicted inaccurate
Chinook, C130s, and apache hits
Baghdad international landing strips
We called it BIOP
You be trying to land and shit, and cats would fire
These are the things we dream when we retire
Brass of the warrior class is cast iron
Forged in the hell-fire of [?] and [?]
All the while knowing that I might die alongside my peers

[Outro]
Yeah
(War-Porn)
