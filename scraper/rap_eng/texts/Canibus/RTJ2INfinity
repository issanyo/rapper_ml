[Samples]
The body is the surface of the mind
We've got infinite power
This is a story of a man that was before his time

[Hook] x3
(Rakim)
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
(Canibus)
Cause every time I stop or seem stuck
Soon as you try to step off, Canibus

[Verse 1 - Canibus]
My soul was created ten thousand years before my body
This album is a physical copy
Human life forms cybernetically upgraded to live at least twice as long
Who writes the song?
The latest technology platform is a robot that raps bars
I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face
Annual spring gala, one billion a plate
No thanks man I already ate
But one day, I'd be honored
To have the authority to say grace
Lord we gather before you, the Almighty infinite
The one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling Triads
Custom tailoring triangles trapped in a tetrahedron timelapse
They labeled me a loser
Germain's Online Observer Graphic Layering Entropy computer Metaphor styles, astronomer royale
Tesla coils around thought forms to separate clouds
Williams the conqueror, defender of the realm
The Adonai warcry in the pits of hell
Rippin' it, spittin' it, the quickening, the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer, breath like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull, never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis, you a bull
Gas tank full, I'm a take 'em to school
Turn gravity upside down, watch everybody say whoa!
Type two civilization and reconciliation
Ten thousand bars plus spaceship
I'm out funded and outnumbered, fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours, I fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul?
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed, the universe is my God's house
Fear not, falling apart
Everything will fall into place when you organize and crossfade bars
The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melodys dwarf rap stars
Returned for the rapture, first contact, first to contact us Negotiating terms of interaction
Aquatic humanoids interbreeding with land mammals
Keynote speakers reference PowerPoint examples
Check out my hermetic poetic planetarium
The alien came out of a female mammalian
Induce cesarean and bury him in bioluminescent aquariums
In a self-sustaining black light solarium
Then after that I live forever, you disagree?
You can't deny RTJ infinity

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2 - Canibus]
No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that Hip-Hop sound
Disagree to disagree until you side with me
But as usual I end up by myself my G
Don't be sensitive or facetious, call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain't around you don't need it
Vague mysterious memories, hard to remember what was said to me
I write so many bars intelligently
It's hard to stay motivated, I'm broken in so many places
I was chasing a dry oasis
Till I found something amazing in the adjacent matrix
I've been anticipating and waiting with a slave's patience
His music and rhymes have been neutralized
Everything he does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite theory in future times
But not right now, right now you just say wow!
Rakim Allah gave me my style
The argon cathodes increase RTR rap flow
If you ain't know before, now you know
By mechanical or digital means
I supervise emcees from annex one through ten and thirteen
The golden boy counts Hip-Hop by the troy ounce
Whenever ten thousand bars is announced
Communicated with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me humankind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault, they were simply influenced
Just like you, just like us all!
Extraterrestrial presence, not right now, I'm studying lessons
I don't even want to go in that direction
My literary creations are guided by God
Through literature and self own images, like that dog!
What we got here is a failure to communicate
Fuck you if you don't like the music I make!
I'm a God by nature, gold inside the trachea
But they forgot Canibus, they just gave up
I came to create the first infinite song
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step, the Lord bless
Hip-Hop, give us back our promise our jobs
Community uplifters, altruistic bars
The light emerged, there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant
The dark came from nothingness
No matter what we do, no matter what we say
One day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak confuse us, insecurities abuse us
We need to do better, the world can use us
Suffering is minimized not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilize every sector allocated
A brand new world, for better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate with silence, satisfy with song
Ten thousand bars, why you took so long?
Canibus still bustin', they still say I ain't sayin' nuttin'
Canibus, what your major malfunction?
Nothing, the heart of Hip-Hop still pumpin'
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl
My baby, my woman, my lady, my queen
She drive me crazy, but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes, the kind that glows with the eyelids closed
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons
She crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissinger kissing Ginger and Jennifer
Straight genders touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you, only to help
There's a failure to communicate, go fuck yourself!
Microwave home cooked meal on the table
Bills in the mailbox, they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you
Talk to the lawyer for the copyright appraisal
On the patent application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares, everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills
Get out of my house, don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about
Regret speech but never silence
Justice might be one sided, that's fine I got nothing to hide then
Spatially gifted, verbally inconvenienced
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go without, I was weakened
I felt cold, slowly breathing
Expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The science of infinite theory and composition

[Hook] x2

[Beat change]

The megalithic master craftsman
(Rip the Jacker)

[Verse 3 - Canibus]
Closet meteorologist, look at the clouds, a storms coming
That's common sense, aight think about this:
Giant monstrosity, 10W40 blood viscosity
Big enough to kill the whole colony
Lock and load, get some
The oil leaking from the barrel drum
I did it all for dinosaur blood
The sky is falling, ocean levels rising from warming
Too much carbon, we all know the real causes
Jet planes in the skies are stalling
Dark Knight riot squads are forming, snakes are coiling
Rats jumping ship, but the water is boiling
Produce is spoiling, state of affairs appalling
Can't believe people still snoring, wake up and stop yawning
Vengeance is mine in the morning
Speech recognize speech, mobile phone signals out of reach
Data plan says your talk is cheap
The king is a captive, trapped by his own inactions
Celebrated after global disaster
That's when Father Author Poor Pauper was captured
His golden palace was collapsed in mist
Grey ashes that were once wide green pastures
With panthers, dragons, tigers, and rappers
Aight, these were the men of minor stature
The megalithic master craftsman
Rip The Jacker

[Hook - Canibus] x4
Cubism and Futurism, writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you can't be serious

[Verse 4 - Canibus]
My brain ain't gettin' enough oxygen
I built a robotic Canibus and now nobody stoppin' us
Black hoodie in the streets, lumberjack fleece
The beast from the east 'bout to thunderclap beats
Ability verse baggage, drop it
Hip-Hop is toxic, I administer the detox process
All over the beat, I rap with my robot to feel complete
He can rap better than me
Not a hard thing to do to cut RTR loose
He gon' show every one of you he got the juice
Personal revelations regarding self preservation
Daily wealth generation, and healthy meditation
Cool. But I can't so I shit my pants
I'm ok, I go sit over there, you go dance
Have fun, go find romance
Can a matchbox man? No. But a tin can
Grant me the prow, Imma fix this thing
Give me the mic, Imma have to climb to sing
Lyric for lyric, layer for layer, prayer for prayer
They want the future thinkin' I'm a failure
Yottabytes of bars, essentially kept on cloud storage
Cause I ain't got the memory for it
I gotta do my best if I could barely pull my own weight
The Easter Island stone face told me to wait
Strength and vitality, the Arawak Indians dance for me
Half a dozen UFOs land for me
Seven billion minds couldn't control the mind of one
Controllin' solar flares coming from (the sun) Shan51

[Beat change]

[Verse 5 - Shan51]
Sixteen the mixing boards channeling the mixing board
Channeling spirits like a ouija board they stare at us all
Evaporated terrestrial walk through the wall
To explain everything about reality to us all
The man knows who our grim wars
Masta matrix manifest miracle Moses into a crystal quartz orb
Smoke chemicals in Taj Mahal, I'm a danger to you all
Buttstock to the skull till the last man
Possess all knowledge known
The days of old when all lyricist were bold and they spoke from the soul
The oxygen I breath is a billion years old
We born to translate codes till something great unfolds
Animate ones and zeros, a sideways eight explode
My occipital lobe glow, remote viewin' the globe
Biological, electro, the truth of mine grows connective nodes Flows tabulated below, you already know

[Verse 6 - Canibus]
Unlimited meaning with words, beyond human reserve
Beyond being protected or served
College is a source for knowledge
So is Shan51, Commander Complex, and Rip the Robotic
Basel III compliant
The psychopath science of LIBOR clients that have to revise their diet
Produce their own food, export or supply it
Sell goods to the market that allow us to buy it
But what if inflation cripple suppliers
Setting off economic dividers that ripple even wider
The sunvisor chief analyzer, H.N.I.C improviser
Just don't get so excited
Over secrets that should not be told
And you should not be so bold
Who are you to judge how they roll
It's a cold world, yes indeed
But into achieving your dreams, then how can you regret what you've seen

[Bridge - Canibus]
Bunch of beats
Eight way sideways eight times C
Speed of light is how long it takes me
I suggest you leave Hip-Hop alone for your own safety
Ten thousand bars is crazy
To be nice I sacrifice things like no sleep

[Verse 7 - Canibus]
He doesn't exaggerate, he claims he was the first rapper in space
Ain't scared to say Rip the Jacker to your face
He was trusted but betrayed
His name led him to his grave, but not before he conquered his rage
What a marvelous day, gardening, parsing in the shade
Quite a change from his militant ways
He said one reckless action can pierce life's wards
But the tongues of the wise will bring healing from the wars
No matter where you go, there you are, standing before God
What does this have to do with a job?
IRA, 401K, I need the pay right away
Go away, "silence!" they say
No escape for the slave, trying to run is like joggin' in place
The Gulags are not very far away, Pompeii
Seven kilometers going the wrong way
Motherfuckers be reading GPS wrong all day

[Verse 8 - Shan51]
Meditate in a Time Machine
Mix back-and-forth with a laser beam
Scream like weapons you can't beat
I concentrate on everybody dreams by using a touchscreen
Billion of souls trapped between The American dream
The supreme being talks to Vishnu and Shiva
To move between shrubs and trees
Screen calls from the unseen, by a prophet, it musta been
I see project blue beam of the Hip-Hop machine
Understand what I mean
A bunch of fake niggas trying to create storyboard scenes
I will be redeemed, as odd as it may seem
I need data pattern stream, a helicopter news team
Try to scream, lighting bolts stream from the heat by the beach
I transform into a beast with wide teeth, tap that cheek
So why speak? Symptoms last for weeks
The best emcee in the world, Complex quoted, that that nigga is ill
Globally about to preach with a poetic masterpiece
Whenever the horns blow
Street sweeper from that beast from the east
Till the death, we are sworn to protect
Hip-Hop is eternal, we gotta live it till the end my friend
But I must rescind, I've got a murder to attend
Bitch please be my guest
Shot the Jacker in the head without breaking a sweat

[Verse 9 - Canibus]
Buddha, Allah, Yahweh, God
Baal, Jesus, Vishnu, Shiva, Om
A stealth pierces the cloud
Seconds later is followed by a sonic boom sound, the war starts now
Conventional or synthetic
Cooper nickel acetal titanium exterior shields and edges
Yeah I'll have a pumpernickel wheat with extra pepper
Sinuses acting up, it must be the weather
Strategic vector flight path, CIA staff
Got some pretty ass bitches, don't be such a tight ass
What's your profession? Poet Laureate, sin sense with seven
I converted infinity into a weapon
Shouted: "Stop complaining, shut up unless you got a solution"
We looking at him, like "What do we do sir?"
He said "Nothing." Then lowered his head
And said "Everything will fix itself in the end"

[Beat change]

[Verse 10 - Shan51]
Syllables deeply known globally
Upholding the Hip-Hop rosary, notably
Greatest mixers of all time supposedly
Murder the Jacker urgently
Observe me perform surgery at the mixing board comfortably
Sent the Jacker to the cemetery, snake eats the canary
Worldwide rhymes surprise many, incendiary vocabulary
Extraordinary galactic emissary, but the designation preliminary
The grid location cosmonaut communication
Through a constellation of a celestial equations
Inundated with stimulation, piezoelectric information
Electro-cranial completely awesome ramifications
Fuckin' supernatural forces all over creation
Creativity from the sky originate from high forces
Smoke jamanic chronic, the aura describes the forces
The corps corpses in armor, to draw flying saucers
It enlightens the brother, engage in battle with satan's monsters
Bathe in heaven water, Van Allen belt holds up my boxers
Forever you motherfucking bastards!
Don't believe NASA, they're just meaningless babblings
Don't believe contractor with a satchel of answers
Proppa' the public propaganda, I am a cherubim commander
The fuckin' smell of gunpowder, rifle, and a rangefinder
The Dillinger spin cylinder, Mumbai murderers
Cold Crush supernova, we underground warriors

[Verse 11 - Canibus]
The shoulder I shoot with is separated stupid
You think you got a better shot than me? Then do it
Now you got the juice, stop the music
Silence, I want you to hear what the truth is
I wanna see humankind rise
I wanna see it with my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop, I want aliens to listen to Hip-Hop
Haters misquote rhymes, pour turpentine down they throats
Let 'em choke with the bamboo vines
Arnold Schwarzenegger, movie screen casualty count
Between him and Sly Stallone they gon' carry you out (no doubt)
Overhead AWACS, wipe the whole place off the map
No excessive force, just rap
What kind of life you got?
You see me here rhyming with this robot
You know a brother love Hip-Hop
Love overboard, choppy water, high winds, and fog
Probably never make it back to shore
The world's crowded but I feel alone
"Imma always be there for you" turns into "now you on your own"
A life of service, no where near politician perfect
I'm glad the wife is a strong person
Imma forget you, but not if you special
Especially if your indiscriminately unsettled
Wherever you at, that's what you settle
Public program policy, pussy to pedal
Metaphors melt metal
Morphed into something that can be used by rebels to fight corporate devils
Raise the drawbridge, fuck you!
You are all dead men, walking, talking bout you awesome
Terabytes of lyrics, Yottabytes of spirits
Some criticize it, some like to hear it
Regulatory tell 'em the story, you have the right to remain silent
Charlie I'm sorry, please stop talking
Strength and vitality, the Arawak Indians dance for me
Because I commanded it to be
I pluck triggers like ukuleles with the strings missing
Wasn't ever into no ring kissing
Biological rhythms, always watching the bottom of women
My harem of Cleopatras, my kittens
When the invitation is given, do not go
The hair and nails of the undead do not grow
I ain't got enough teeth to properly eat meat
I can't barbecue cause property ain't cheap
Construction cost per square foot
Either we got to stay put, or we gotta find somewhere else to cook
When I'm satisfied I'll deliver
Take the arrow out of the quiver, RTR, come battle me nigga
X-ray vision, night goggle, Ripper block Google and Twitter
While I harness homing pigeons for biohazard contingents
All living organic conditions
Maybe this'll put your symptoms back in remission?
We spit so much things we don't know taking place
But they are taking care of everything everyday
Lyrebirds mimic my voice
The hardest thing to avoid turns out to be the simplest choice
I'm a deepwater dredge, till you get it through your motherfucking head
One day you'll remember what I said
What happens when seven billion minds couldn't match the mind of one?
Cause Shan solar flares coming from the sun
Composition none of your business
So what are you thinking? I'm thinking he's gifted
He should be under urgent care supervision
Was there anything he said or anything written?
He said these ten thousand bars were brilliant

[Beat change]

[Samples]
And you maintain, you still maintain
This kind of evil can be combated
Yes, always has been, always will be
Verse 51, verse 51

[Hook - Shan51] x2
Shan51 flying around in the troposphere
Shan51 back spinning like molecules yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan51 the light bearer, the rhyme with divine layers

[Verse 12 - Shan51]
Jackers better say they prayers Rip The Jacker 2 infinity is here
Padlock your chances you're not prepared everybody scared
I battled emcees for 10 years they fear when I bus
Poem sparks a fierce Roebuck
Several miles deep underneath The earth
Shan51 visionary the math design a magnificent verse in 2012
I passed the phase the telepathic ability birth ripple net worth
All work peered deep in here herc completely and strong stem my work
Call God cursecolder than a heart of a murk
Close like a label less childbirth
It takes place below the dirt
The key makes a turn let it be turned
A new man emerge badly burned
Smells like a bag erb
Vision is getting blurred a sound scientifically superb every verse is well herd
Perform a cappella surgery
You rep TV surf sand 50 won't you murder me hip box will chase you through the turf

[Hook - Shan51]
Shan51 flying around in the troposphere
Shan51 back spinning like molecules yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan51 the light bearer, the rhyme with divine layers

[Verse 13 - Shan51]
Fly robin fly, till you get shot out the sky
That's a cop out, nice try
Ten thousand bars means I'm a part of rap music forever
But I don't know if I want that pressure
That's why I built a robot to live out the legacy
Rip the Robot is the best emcee
They stealth detention is nothing, RTR is under construction
I can't wait till RTJ press the button
Like inspected gunship zone dumping
Maintainin' a holding pattern at altitude above cloud cover
Range: All the way out to Pluto and back again
And by the time it gets back rap won't exist
It'll have to be rediscovered
The history of it is not very uncovered, J to the blue-collar puppet
Accepted, applauded, rewarded
At sun down sheep will be slaughtered
Unless the blood of lamb makes an offer
We do not to negotiate with any enemy elements
Dragon, snake, eagle, rat, donkey, or elephant
Music for the meditative therapist
They call me a heretic but Poet Laureate never quit
Used to say "Yeah I'll battle you, then reinvest the financial capital and build a robot to out rap you"
Now that's what I call a real rap star
The six-point facemask of the Jaguar

[Hook - Shan51]
Shan51 flying around in the troposphere
Shan51 back spinning like molecules yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan51 the light bearer, the rhyme with divine layers

These revelations coincide with the equally accurate predictions of Complex
Both futurists included in their writings suggestions of an apocalypse
Sometime near the year 2012

The brain is only a binary computer, a series of on/off switches
That's the basis of my computer generated people program

Rip the Jacker
