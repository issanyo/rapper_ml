[Verse 1: Webb]
I break an MC like a [date?]
So let me flip display
I be in that ass like bounty hunters looking for niggas who skipped court dates
So don't get upset, 'cause I get respect in my sector
I swing with magnitude and direction like a vector
I come at you with some ill shit, I'll make your squad forfeit
I apply so much force I knock the Earth straight off it's orbit
No doubt, so let me shed some light on this [cypher?] with persistence
I hit you with distance like a sniper
I'm breaking it down, so even the most illiterate niggas can figure out how I gross six figures, see it's like that
Give me my mic back
I'm hoping the street life got niggas losing their life just for scoping
So beware, watch where you stare, 'cause niggas don't care
They'll stab their own moms in the back if they have to take it there
I'm on the lookout for niggas who wanna get took out
Straight off the dome, don't even try to bring your book out
Respect my intellect when I penetrate your mental
Kill the chit-chatter, or I'll shatter your whole dental
My techniques flip beats like they was [careless?]
My squad rolls rugged like eighteen-wheeled trailers

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I spark the buddha then I have dreams like Martin Luther
Yes indeed, to me weed is like a turbo booster
I'm mentally unstable, all my lyrics are fatal
Because I eat my dinner on a periodic table
See niggas front like they hard, they wanna be bad
I make your faggot ass crew raise a white flag
I'm spectacular with more vigor than Acura
Superior like the great lake that borderlines Canada
Cause I'm the Canibus, lyrical analyst
I would be proud freestyling clearing the way like an ambulance
I plan to open closed my mind like curtains because
I'm constantly building like Puerto Rican constuction workers
My thought process is mysterious like the Loch Ness
A hundred times more complex than Mr. Spock gets
When I come through niggas stand stiller than statues
If I have to, I'll battle an entire rap crew
You know how I do, my style is absurd
I'll rip your skin off just to get on your nerves
So brace yourself while I blow up the spot
Cause lyrically my whole shit is butter like scotch
