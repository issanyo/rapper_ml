If I'm hawking you like a bird, it ain't because I respect you god
Its because im trying to find a perfect place for me to shit on
Niggas hear about me and discreetly set up a date to me
To see if they can defeat me
So I ain't ready to let no motherfucker eat me
That's why you find little pieces of MCs in my feces weekly
You can't beat me you can't control+alt+delete me
Nigga you can't even shine on a song that features me
Slippery saliva keeps my delivery tighter
Enabling me to outmaneuver Russian MIG Fighters
Launching missiles on whack rap artists like they was targets
For coming to broader markets with that garbage
From downtown Newark to South Orange, niggas is paying homage
I'll battle you for anything you own worth pawning
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with my tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
From the 'How Can I Be Down?' conference to the Gavin
Whack emcees get slapped in their faces for rapping
For absolutely no Rhyme or Reason I start beefing
Spitting words faster than two Puerto Ricans speaking
Keys for me to make examples out of someone you respect
And that will discourage you from trying to test
Whoever ain't nice enough to rhyme wit me
Should surrender their soul and combine with me
Or die violently, I try to be a millionaire before the year's up
I'm hungry like a dog with his ears up
This little nigga with heart from north Newark
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of the great white shark, I'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrically laser is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of the cranial cavity
Is what actually what happens for any motherfucker for trying to battle me
90 minutes of heat, 90 minutes of lyrics and beats, 90 minutes and these brick city streets
Mad ball and tab one keeping it tight
Canibus for 97' and I'm out like Blue Trice
