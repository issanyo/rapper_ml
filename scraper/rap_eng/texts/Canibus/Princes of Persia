[Keith Murray]
We stepped in the gym like we President Nixon
DJ Funk Flex was the DJ mixing
DJ Kay Slay bought all them vixens
We jigga diamonds baby like the ____
Just in, guess who stepped in
______ in the ___ red skin
We're The Prince of Persians

[Canibus]
Yeah, you run though that, I run through the track
Evil D producing the track, let loose raps
I floss, what the fuck you shut your mouth for
Metaphors so raw you already an outlaw
Some punk elephant trunk, wan tan pneumatic tongue
Don't give a fuck where you rappers is from
Lyrically left crystal meth breath spit to the death
Since you are so hard to impress with the visual depth

[Chorus: Keith Murray (Canibus)
Gather round people, got a story to tell
'Bout two bad brothers you know so well
(The most dangerous emcees known to man
They don't even have to hold microphones in their hands)
Known for putting it down all around the world
Kick it with all the homeboys and the fly girls
(The most dangerous emcees known to man
They don't even have to hold microphones in their hands)

[Keith Murray]
I'm the mad matador of this Hip Hop decor
Nostalgic ___ like 2Pac Shakur

[Canibus]
Sure the tom-tom blaze to signal the start of a long day
Undergod's rhyme gon' pay
Germaine sing the chorus like Ichabod Crane
In a forest cutting colour coordinated camouflage artist
A poet in the zone and the poetry has a life of it's own
The Prince of Persia put it down homes

[Keith Murray]
It roams and drones of those who knows
'Bout the international kids with global flows
To the weak mind I'm Mr Knowitall
Half man, half neanderthal, the Prince of Persia

[Canibus]
What is the meaning of a routine screening with fans screaming
Everything begins to get propaganda feeling
Volcanoes erupt, inhale the Moon dust
We should all fall in love before the world blows up
Open mic night strand, the great grandson of Sam
The summer jams with blood on my hand and drugs in the van
Right where I need to be, I don't need you to speak to me
Just because I smoked weed recently
The Prince of Persia
