[Intro: Canibus]

The Horsemen
Apocalyptic reinforcements
Let's get it on then

[Verse 1:  Canibus]

Horsemen
Rhyming again
Let's not even pretend
The speech plan you yourself never heard before them
I devour prey every hour a day
Why the fuck would they give a fuck about what I say?
Supernatural acid channel the deity of battle
The power of Papu in the Tower of Babel
Craig Mack 1000 degrees
Fight naked so you can't hide nothing up your sleeve
Beyond the universe and back
They collapse when I'm done with that
Bis be all over the track
You better kneel before Zod and his 200 pound bulldog
Or you could fuck off and get a real job
Pick the phone up, identify the numbers, Puss
Dial 626 cause they bring bush
Black face take over the place
Gimme space
We participate every iditarod race
How darn hard can my floss face frost
Kaleidoscope balls in asymmetrical wall
War on my medical card
Last name "Wars"
When you step to me you telling me you trying to get lost

[Outro: Canibus]

I'm a Horseman!
