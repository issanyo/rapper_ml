[Intro: Caller, Jay Z & (Howard Stern)]
(Go ahead you’re on the air with Jay Z)
Hey Jay, what’s up man?
What’s happenin’?
With uh, today’s market
Pretty much watered down by people that took Biggie’s style
How do you feel about talent like Canibus not gettin’ a fair shake?
Um, I, I think all artists should get a fair shake
Uh Talib Kweli, Common Sense, Canibus
You know, I like the guy’s integrity

[Verse 1]
Paul Allen’s birthday party aboard the Crystal Harmony
1998, so far from poverty
Sixty nautical miles off the Puget Sound
Madonna’s music playin’ in the background
Dr. Ruth sat across from me, Bill Gates walked out
Angela Bassett tried to talk to me
He pointed to his residence off the starboard bow
Looked like the President’s White House, we all said, “Wow”
In my mind I’m like, “This is dope right now”
I just sat down, sip some white wine and lounge
He asked everybody if they was enjoyin’ theyself
I thought to myself, “Of course we enjoyin’ your wealth”
He asked me, “What do you do?” I told him, “I’m an entertainer”
He said, “A singer?” I said, “Nah, I produce bangers”
I didn’t fit in, fat gold chain on
Pure Playaz sweatsuit, Timbs and shades on
Paul Allen standin’ there with Elvis Presley sideburns
I guess that was to keep his face warm
This bad shorty I was with, yeah she brought me along as a guest
I had to give it to her, I was impressed
We spent four days and five nights, wine and twilight
I didn’t give a fuck about no Source or five mics
Selwyn, Carlito and Datwon Thomas
Them wicked ones used Hip Hop to divide us

[Verse 2]
I’m a genius of compositions like Mark Mothersbaugh of the hood
In a circular lime green studio in Hollywood
I stood right there and watched them produce
The theme song for a film that I wasn’t into
Back to the East Coast boom bap beats, I agree
Irskine and Danielle Lost Boyz Management Team
Clark Kent - Peter Panik - Chuck Bone - CL from Cornerstone
Gimmie another shot of cortisone
The Lex coup Beamers Benz ranges & Bentleys
Star Wash Carwash customer friendly
Goin through the Holland Tunnel clockin 120
If it wasn't for Kevin? Treach would've killed Wendy
Talkin all that shit, comin' outta' Hot '97
Big Pun was like "fall back Bis"
I ran dats to Frankfurt & Wayne flat tire, tags expired
The Negro League had a deal with Mariah
And them Penthouse Ponies from Kya, at the table with the homie and Naomi when he gave her them diamonds
Hopped the train to MDC in BK
Got rosaries for this nigga, lemmie see what he say
They was solid solid gold, can't argue with that right?
Always hold my niggas down that's the story of my life
My memory base jumpin' all over the place
Just put the pieces together, ain't none of it fake

[Verse 3]
West Coast Californ-i-a, shit is real
In the front yard smokin’ some turtle with Henry Hill
He put me on the phone with Karen, she in Seattle
We was just talkin’ ‘bout life, it’s all natural
I told him ‘bout how I do music, nothin’ major
I just came back from Fort Lewis via Vegas
Henry was writin’ a book, workin’ on the pages
I remember the movie ‘bout his life he was famous
He asked me ‘bout 2nd Round, don’t ask me why
Bad Boys don’t advertise but I had to comply
I said how cool Mike was, don’t believe the lies
And how Tyson lived next to the Sultan of Brunei
I drove Mike’s Porsche up to the Sultan’s gate
He had satellite security we had to wait
He got out, walked inside, it’s night time
They had a mini horse track around the property line
I lost money at Kentucky Derby, ‘cause I ain’t lucky like that
I just got memories about Rap
Remember, put this in your CD-ROM:
WWW dot Canibus dot com
Few people understood where I was goin’ when I said it
I was so far ahead in the future, I regret it
Isolated, forced to fight with the basics, I looked crazy
But the truth is, it’s so amazin’
I got friends in high places, but countless enemies
With deep seeded hatred who don’t want me to say shit

[Verse 4]
They took away my green card, Figaro!
Mickey the Monkey can't travel overseas no mo'
I moved back to Atlanta, back to the basics
Northside Drive Dallas Austin lives in a spaceship
Stamps in my passport, been many places
So many situations, so many faces
In the limo with the High Priest on the way to a SONY party
The only time I met Nas
Me Jerry and Pras and the High Priest skipped the line
We had Beast with us - looking like SPETZNAZ
We stepped inside, everybody knew I wrecked rhymes
Like "Bring the record back selecta!"
Spent 20 minutes and bounced, it was more like 10
But who's countin'? And that's when everything got clouded
The high priest had on black tuxedo slacks
With red shirt and red alligators to match
Back in the limo, I’m lookin’ at my world through a tinted window
I’m thinkin’, “Can it all be so simple?”
The priest put his hand on his heart, pledging allegiance
And said he was the son of Na-Webwey, believe it
He wore a pinky ring, said the ring made him a mobster
Then he said Na-Webwey Bobby Ebola was his father
That’s Theodore Bowen, Jezebel Boule
Timmy Visine, Velvet Mafia all day
It got to be something to it ‘cause they live like gods
And it’s the truth, that’s some real Hip Hop OooRah

[Verse 5]
K-Solo, Bolo, Pakman, Born Sun
David Madison, The Sharpshoota' Clan
Maintainin' my mojo record vocals, I went from
Underground to worldwide pan global
Back to independently distributed local, life is so anecdotal
I still rep like I'm supposed to
2005 summertime Orlando
Shaquille O'Neil wearing 22 inch sandals
Cory Gunz - Money Mark, Kay Slay nigga, Papoose
Young Zee the whole got damn crew
Deja 34, back then, I was so damn raw
Nobody could see me bar for bar
Look at me Superman vs Bizarro, Kryptonite cargo embargo
Listen they ain't want no parts yo
The red, white and blue, 500 lb bomb proof
Shock troop Sarcos suit MarK Mach II
The 5-10 program, freedom is a slave to no man
If you need me on point I got you!
Lock 'em, load 'em and shock 'em, rock 'em top to bottom
1st Cav put the kibosh on all columns
What option? Nothing! Need oxygen
Howard Stern took me to a Hip Hop Event - one time but not again, what?

[Outro: Howard Stern, Canibus & (Gary Dell'Abate)]
Canibus is here
