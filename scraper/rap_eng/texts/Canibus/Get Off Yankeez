"Man, get up, I got up"
"They said to be quick my friend, and +Get Off Ya Kneez+"
"I got up, they said to be quick my friend, and +Get Off Ya Kneez+"
"The word 'I can't' nobody knows"
"They said to be quick my friend, and +Get Off Ya Kneez+"
"I got up, they said to be quick my friend, and +Get Off Ya Kneez+"
"The word 'I can't' nobody knows"

[Verse One: Canibus]
Yo, +Get Off Ya Kneez+, change your style cause it's time
Niggas want me to rhyme pre-'99
No one can flow with 'Bis, most people know this
But others just won't admit, they can't get over it
Rhymes I been known to spit, mic's I been known to grip
Makes me the ultimate, Godfather over this
I'm just a ghost of Rip
A soldier in this show business don't exist if he has no defense
My opponents are so intent not to show respect
They fret cause I'm a global threat
I'm so hard to catch, a covert celeb
I relocate so quick they can't close the net
I expose the press, dispose of the prints
On the loose again nobody knows what's next
My virus infects, every machine with clandestine speech
Nigga +Get Off Ya Kneez+

[Verse Two: Canibus]
Yea, Hip-Hop's habitat, Rip the Jacker's back
This is battle rap, therefore I master tracks
I mix an with thrax in your digestive track
I suggest it's whack, then I sidestep to the back
I kidnap your ex, for ten million Francs
Make you shit your pants; you smell like septic tanks
Just respect it man throw a fist in the air
The distance is near, Armageddon is here
I permeate unworldly planes
As they crash in the Worlds that Trade, only my words remain
Altruist Egoist, people are ignorant
What is the meanin' of meaningless meaningfulness?
Formulas of primordial audio
Forty ohms of euphorial anointed flows
It Was Written so it shall be told
+Get Off Ya Kneez+, give me the microphone
Motherfucka +Get Off Ya Kneez+

[Verse Three: Canibus]
My manhood is massive, when it's not flaccid
'Bis is real cool when he's not +Rip the Jacker+
I am modernesque, I am complex
Vicarious logic of bodily hardship
Beat your ass 'til your teeth mash
Sand-blast your face blow a breeze past, make you bleed fast
EKG's beep fast, doctors speak fast
For skin graft the patch over deep gash
Give me details, how does meat smell
After a train derails into a field of gazelles?
Step in the club; turn the crystal in your cups to red blood
Fuck your heads up
Suspend me from the game, don't mention my name
Impossible Can-I-Bus rupturin' your brain
Don't be a schmuck, you act like a movie
I've proved I'm the illest you cannot disprove me
+Get Off Ya Kneez+
