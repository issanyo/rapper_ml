(Canibus)
This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason
The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it
We cursed since birth, imprisoned by these Earth demons
My verse is written in secret, then released in pieces
The sting of rejection, the sour sensation of perfection
It's connected to our spiritual ascension
Start with yourself, you are your only contender
The game of life has no winners, therefore we surrender

(Chorus: Canibus)
Write now! Write your thoughts down, now! Recite them out loud, now!
The bright light bleeds down through the dark clouds, now!
Right Now brothers, now! Right Now sisters, now!
Right Now people, now! Right Now Rippers!

(Canibus)
The rhyme is my religion, the rhythm is alive, listen
And bear witness, try to share my vision
My vision of my soul inside Sol, free the globe
Inside a globe with two poles, Ouroboros in my poems
Bestowed by a poet, what do you know and when did you know it?
Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components
Omit this, admit this a myth 'til I spit
You forget how ill I get, the Ripper's 'bout to Rip, Right Now
Right Now
