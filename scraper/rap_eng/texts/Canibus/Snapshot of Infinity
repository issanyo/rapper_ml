Infinity, divinity
Commander of the symphony
Infinity, divinity
The secret to creativity
Infinity, divinity
You cannot contend with this
Infinity, divinity
When I let it rip

The secret to creativity
Infinity, divinity
You cannot contend with this
Infinity, divinity
When I let it rip

[Verse 1]
Sit it down at the mixing board, I was told in a dream
One day I would be redeemed, conscious, understand what I mean
A dose of [?], my pupils, eyes increase
My higher self filter in between, playground for the supreme
This is not fantasy, this is manifest reality
You must control how to channel it, strategy
Light as a feather, density, fourth dimensional energy
Fifth dimensional memories, hyper dimensional weaponry
Battle me for an infinite salary, following flattery
Serious savagery, couldn't pick a more impossible fantasy
Psyche, religious from a alchemist chemistry
Incendiary vocabulary illuminated speech and wizardry
Every single living soul is a mirror of who I am physically
Theoretically, inseparable, incredible
I am fifty [?] cycles of matter perpetually
Each time perfectly, what does the future hold?
What do you really see?

[Verse 2]
I feel like I spoke to the over minds, [?] divine
Hooked it up and started mixing up the lines, step for mankind
Reconditioning, witnessing end times
I wanna see humankind rise, keep your eyes in the sky
There's fifty (one) mystical mysteries, [?]
In a zero gravity environment, solar activity
Poetic antiquity, you will witness infinity
This ain't no fricking fake reality, Rip the Jacker to infinity
I energize the rap community, enter your mind
Eternity on [?], stab you with electricity
I'm trapped in my gravity, and positive polarity
I only care about infinity (infinity)
Merely a vessel that the entity channels strength to vitality
The Arawak Indians dance for me
Half a dozen UFOs land for me, mechanical rap royalty
Who beat the blood out the bee with heavy artillery?
