[Verse 1: Canibus]
The odds are you can't even tell the mixing board is a holy grail
For styles like this only for those who know it well
It's unknown but won't fail
Another stone for Thanos to unveil requiring control skill
Mix without crashing zig-zag-Allah autopilot passengers
Hypnotized by the magic practice
Pragmatic practicalist poetry in motion by accident
And cry like I never asked for this
The experiment for buzz, that's what Hip Hop was
I stutter and s-s-s-shit on you cuz
The great Pun breath control vernacular
Ginger extract with cold press Canibus oil so elaborate
Asymetric incription eyeballs can't see
DJ deepstate book the false flag for the weekend
Mind control mehmet tutuahmet
Ultra beam is tonerpoke had two m3 two-seaters

[Hook: Nappi Music]
What are the odds this is all a design
What are the odds if this is all in our mind
What are the odds  that these thoughts aren't mine
What are the odds that i'll make it out alive
What are the odds we were created to survive
What are the odds they created us so we die
What are the odds we're are all gods and they lied
What are the odds?

[Verse 2: Canibus]
The odds are they are just rapper shills
I skin them with scallop shells and send them back to Hell where their master dwells
13 day calender Hateful the Damager
Pick up your heat signature on infrared aperture
Draconian dracula, Omega-MAGA-thug
Communion coagulate blood with saltine cracker crumbs
Sit back and laugh at them
The whole world is mine, every continent especially Africa
This is America long booth alpha puff stare at ya
Tear at ya flesh devour your character
Father do not forgive them they know what they do
Military tribunal lock load and shoot
The Garden of Eden is guarded by a demons
Drug addicted heathens of barbarous believers
Semiramis belus Nimrod ninus
Translate to English, some worshipping gatekeepers of flesheaters

[Hook: Nappi Music x2]
What are the odds this is all a design

What are the odds we were created to survive

What are the odds we're are all gods and they lied
What are the odds?
