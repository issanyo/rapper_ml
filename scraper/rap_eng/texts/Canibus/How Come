[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
(Here come the drums)
You ever woke up one morning and ask this question?
(Here come the drums)
Check it out
How come?
Thugs wanna disrespect me in the clubs
How come? How come?
Shootouts over chicken heads out there

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, as the universe expands
I contemplate whether it was God or the Big Bang that made man
Sometimes I wonder how come we can't live without guns
What would of been the outcome if the South won?
Think about that son
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm?
The federal communications commission listens to politicians in the position
To make certain decisions like puttin' minorities in prison
To decimating the population of women, it's called socialism
From the United States to the United Kingdom
Aahhkk, spit into the sky and extinguish the sun
But how come?

[Verse 2: Canibus]
In the future, the location is planet Earth
The time and date is 1999, December 31st
11:59 p.m
The anticipation of what I think's about to happen got my heartbeatin'
We got less than a minute left before
The planet Jupiter is ignited into a star
I know it sounds bizarre but it's mathematics
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants
Those who understand know what I'm sayin is accurate
Our country is corrupt from the president to the cabinet
In the year 2 followed by three 0's
The space probe Galileo will welcome us all to channel zero
But how come?
