We created Hip Hop so we didn't need street gangs and drug dealers
Hip Hop has a responsibility
No matter what generation you're from, you come now, past, present, or future
Y’all motherfuckers can make whatever y'all want
For me, it's fucking homicide and genocide
People are killing each other
I don't hate on this generation of Hip Hop but we gotta create Hip Hop all over again

Grown men wearing makeup, you make me sick
I'm in the barber chair, 20 dollar shape up shit
And "don't worry if I write checks, I write rhymes"
Nobel peace prize, whoever came up with that line
Statistically, anonymously speaking, the country is dreaming
So what? The whole universe is shrinking
Society on the brink, tell me why do you think?
The blood wash off long before the courtroom ink
Well if imma hump the pig, imma tear it up
Maybe improvise earplugs with cigarette butts, 'n stink
TIG, MIG, Imma make my own sig, ya dig?
A serial killer in drag with a wig
Take a swig, blue pill first, red pill second
"The black pill is a black and white Hollywood western"
Jamie Foxx Jango, Clint Eastwood meets Rambo
Hungry enough to eat that ammo

If you look at Hip Hop right now:
Purple fur coats, diamonds, champagne
Rolls Royce’s, Bentley's, fucking Learjet’s
Sex, violence... Everybody's living that life
Right now we need a 17 to 19 year old individual to make "The Message"
To shut down all the nonsense that we're celebrating!
