[Hook: Canibus]
Come in Dagga this is Cloak
Check the flow
PXO start the countdown to Ground Zero
Yo Brother J, I bust the AK
I salute you and parade, rest and wait for the day

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Canibus commandment, the Eagle has landed
Those who don't understand it
Will be left stranded face down in a sand pit
I wait for the riot on a mountain lion meat diet, eat and be quiet
Five murks low tide high surf in the dirt
I curse and burp like Wyatt Earp
We can't sleep, feel pain but can't weep
Brother J got the MP3 on full sweep
Outside the wire, flat tire, fuel truck on fire
180 days to retire
Return from Mecca ADK tax free
Escalade upgrade, one IED from the grave
Once a day we drink Gatorade in the shade
While special ed plays, I got it made
The guy who tried to shoot me looked like Gary Busey
The whole troop salute me, the news interviewed me
I write under chemlights same color ten types
The pen tip strikes the mic, burst into light
I lowered the rent, PXO climbed the board with his man
With dried hemoglobin on his pants
Low pressure suppressors sound like twin agents cessnas
Defective thrust leaves you breathless
The spirit of Pac atop Mount Ziggurat
In a rock with his own thug paradise Glock
Hip Hop's G.W. Prescott
Battle to rest stop in the death box, let's not

[Hook: Canibus]
Yo come in Dagga this is Cloak, check the flow
PXO start the Countdown to Ground Zero
Yo Brother J, I bust the AK
I salute you and parade, rest and wait for the day
Return from Mecca
The Ground Zero inspectors
