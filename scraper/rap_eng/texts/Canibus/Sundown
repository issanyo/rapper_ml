Yeah
I amaze you like I'm disabled
As I continue to keep Hip-Hop stable
I was made to, subinac submariner
Outside the outer barrier, also known as Canibus
I guided my horse down the slope by a rope
I saw men frozen in the snow still in their coats
Whisper sweet nothings in Russian
I be grunting â€˜til the sun comes up, two guns in the air bustin'
Received the information, so I can't be complacent
Town population; ten percent, Head Trauma patients
Legends request the presence, they ask for the illest
The secrets of the town's treasures? I'll never tell it
Customize one-liners, heavy-ion colliders
When the sun rises, euthanize them
Attack on principle, nobody's invincible
Especially when the criminals look identical
Training is quintessential
I paid the orthodontist that pretends to alter my dental
Croupier card dealers with cold killers
Holding Tequila with Pancho Villa posing for the picture
Legends request the presence, they ask for the illest
The secrets of the town's treasures? I'll never tell it //
