[Canibus]
I go to war
I keep it raw
I go hard
I go to war
I spar
I keep it raw
I go hard

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth and pull then I feed you to the pit bulls
Don't even talk about guns
The only 9 you got is a $5 bill and 4 ones
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
‘Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on a record?
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
‘Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode
Explode, leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in

[Canibus]
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar.... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Can-I-Bust, I bust off before the coin toss
Then I rip your loin cloth off, look how small your genitals are
You got a Napoleon complex, barber shop gossip
Says you used to grab ya ankels in jail for all the convicts
Lap dancing quadraceps
As fruity as a pina colada on a tropical island in the Bahamas
Trying to win a bikini contest
Them skeletons in ya closet got flesh on them and they smell rotten
Trying to battle is like standing on a launch pad
In Cape Canaveral with me in the astronaut capsule
Ready to blast you on a journey to space
Ready to turn your whole face into sirloin steak
Comparable to questions in Bible
How is it possible that the model ship fit in the neck of a bottle
A congo in this concrete jungle, pull out your tonsils
And stomp you into the earth like fossils

[Canibus]
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar.... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitch-ass niggas and bitch-ass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 4/5th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's fingerprint is
If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt-naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
I'm the type of nigga that will prove it, produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
‘Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I'll survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod

Is it all soldier
Sir, yes sir!
Is there anything you need
Sir, no sir!
Report back to me before the briefing, at ease!
