(Verse 2: Canibus)

I show off, when I show up turn your microphone off
The road hawk, you look like Danica Patrick with her clothes off
You trying to stone toss, you got bone loss so don't talk
You about to pole vault then get broke off
After I beat you with the crowbar
Drag you off with the John Deere go-cart
Back to the doggone tribal chief Omar
Eat the homemade stone age nose gauge
You get faded smokin' that haze in the stone cave
Playin' Mel Torme, lookin' at your dead body all day
You trade Columbian ye for North American handmade crochet
The swap shop  for Hip Hop Black Ops
How much for that gun-metal gray gun rack and that black tackle box?
I'm David [Alico?] battlin' at the Alamo
My job is to shove this barrel up your asshole
Cause you could never pass my prime, you can't pass go
You couldn't pass a pigskin with an underhand throw
You wanna show off?
I'll show you with the spit boss say
I gave out TKO's when TDK's was sent GTO cassette decks
Pressin' play, the bull charge, OLE!
You better off holding your breath for four days
Whatever niggas done on the mic, I did triple
It's nothing to rip you, I'm spittin' against the cripple
Tweakin' off crystal, I X-Game snowball flip you
Yeah, to stick around for pictures cause I'm a prick too
You born after '82? It's my responsibility to raise you
Disrespect me I slay you on Pay-Per-View
That's crazy for me, but crazy for you
I told you you look like Danica in some fuckin' Daisy Dukes
I'm the Intimidator, the Nitro Negro Creator
The dark Dirk Diggler,  the drunk Darth Vader
The dub from K-man, his plantation in Jamaica
Vlad the Impaler, VladTV assassinator!
