"They don't know what they fuckin' with
They don't know how you bussin' 'Bis
They don't know how you comin' man
They don't know how you done this shit
Yo, show them how a brotha spit //"

(Canibus)
The emcee, with the N.O.T.T.Z

(Canibus)
"Ayo
Canibus'll spark it for ya, Nottz'll paint the target for ya
MicClub'll launch it towards ya
This is the beginning of the rest of my life
Grippin' the mic, and rippin' it right, you listen, you like
You dislike, you get disciplined with the pipe
Muzzle flashes a light that says goodbye to life
I'm antisocial but humble, I'll blow a hole in you
To get a hello from you, if that's what it comes to
A little camera-shy, I play the background
Turn the mic on, lock the cage, I attack crowds
Ya'll niggas is just clones that rhyme
From a bloodline that's closer to yours than mine
You ignore the signs but we all divine
DJ's rewind, MC's distort the time
Sharp enough to read your mind I can hear your applause in silence
Ya'll fuckin' with an awesome talent //"

"They don't know what they fuckin' with

"They don't know what they fuckin' with

(Canibus)
"Yo
You've gotta call this a comeback, I've been here for years
You should thank God for answering your prayers
The Hip Hop hero, off of Hip Hop skid row
I'll rip a show for a beer and a smoke
You know that Hip Hop flow, that got them clearing both coasts
For that Hip Hop show, where I appear as the host
Used to be the type of emcee they were scared to approach
Nowadays I just share what I know, spare what I don't
Might act like I care, but I don't
See, they want me to share, it's only logical they fear what I wrote
Forty-fives with broken handles, go off like roman candles
Ricocheting through your mans and you
They're so busy tryin' to get an ambulance for you
They ain't notice that a fan was hit too, planning to sue
They've got a lot of anger for you
Introduce you to the anger management crew with Canibus too
Switch places with the person that was banishing you
And start strangling you and keep strangling you //"

"They don't know what they fuckin' with
They don't know how you bussin' 'Bis
They don't know how you comin' man
They don't know how you done this shit
Yo, show them how a brotha spit //"

Yo
They don't know how to double 'Bis
They already would've done this shit
Canibus the original thumbprint
Five emcees, pick one quick
He's usually on the thumb you lift

(Canibus)
"Yo
Ya'll fuckin' with an awesome talent
I can't be silent, where's the balance?
I'm on some Kanye shit, waiting for my spaceship
Exercisin' patience, grinding for this paper
The universal language is love, not hatred
Sex, money and drugs destroyed the foundation
That's what I would say if I had to make a statement
When sex, money and drugs built this proud nation
Salvation without authentication
False pagans bought lawmakers to orchestrate how the law changes
We the new breed of fire-breathers
Inspired speeches got fans fighting in bleachers
They can't keep quiet neither
I want to team up with the best there is
Bless the mic and address what is, impress the kids
The deep life I live is shallow to sheep
'Til I show a couple of scars, let the experience speak //"
