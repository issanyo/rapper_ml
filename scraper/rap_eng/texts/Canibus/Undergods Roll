[Keith Murray]
What the fuck
What the fuck
When I step to the mic I get a rush
Keith Murray and Canibus, what the fuck you wanna discuss
Crush fistful of dollars like the Outlaw Josey Wales
All the bitches holla, create cold days in hell
We the spooks that stood by the door
Took us
They want us to tone it down, I don't know what the fuck for
Smoke out brothers, on the cars stay raw
Fuck you asshole niggas til' you all sore

[Canibus]
Why I oughtta
Take you down to the control room where we conduct torture
You won't talk shit no more, son
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder drama
Fistful of Dollars
Zero tolerance, right turn clot him
The subwoofer sound like two dragons looking for chow
They are still lookin' even now
Rifle off the rack, sling it around my back
Get the big round furry hat and burlap sack for y'all niggas
Conduct this Undergod business

[Keith Murray]
Stop! He's killin' me! Somebody call the cops!
Our metaphor split infinite ways

[Canibus]
Keep your proximity or get knocked into infinity
You still can't fuck with me lyrically

[Keith Murray]
Going go right
Picture this

[Canibus]
When I was growin' up I learned trust is no such
There are things in this world that you don't wanna touch

[Keith Murray]
Stop! He's killin' me! Somebody call the cops!
The beat is the weed, the flow is the munchies
And line by line, we eat emcees

[Canibus]
They some sucka' emcee, diva muthafukaz
This is hip-hop music, we don't need no chorus

[Keith Murray]
When this horrific vocab spit
Your bowels'll shift, you smoked a pound of spliff

[Canibus]
Keep your proximity or get knocked into infinity
You still can't fuck with us lyrically

[Keith Murray]
Stop! He's killin' me! Somebody call the cops!
We grapple on gravel
Y'all niggas scared

[Canibus]
Special agent said page him, then ten other suits came in
The Coke bottle started levitatin'

[Keith Murray]
This is psycho, psychotic, stupid, crazy
Make all the funky bitches get neurotic

[Canibus]
Twelve bars take you to hell god
Head get lopped off in the trailer park

[Keith Murray]
Stop! He's killin' me! Somebody call the cops!
He's a fuckin' liar
All the guards know he psycho monkey cypher

[Canibus]
His death would happen the reverse way
On his next birthday he was searchin' for the words to say

[Keith Murray]
I walked in the room with an axe
Put three gashes in his back

[Canibus]
Yeah rip off the flesh, come at you like this
On some Samurai shit, had an axe to your neck

[Keith Murray]
Don't approach us excited, we might get nervous
We not liable for what we do when we get nervous

[Canibus]
We told you keep your proximity or get knocked into infinity
You still can't fuck with us lyrically

[Keith Murray]
I put my hand in the air
Boop, boop
Put

[Canibus]
Slipped on his toes, got clipped in his hole
Canibus, Keith Murray, how the Undergods roll
Undergod shit
Psychosomatic
How the Undergods roll
Psychosomatic
