[Hook: Canibus]
A man pays dues, do this become an angel
Good and evil, a man stays true
There are other ways to win
Good and Evil, it's the same thing

A decade after my debut, the game changed; I got the same views
To me it's just baseball and I'm Babe Ruth
Bambataa from Planet Rock, trade op commander Hip Hop
What? We grimlock smash Spitbox
You can never be the best, until you complete the competency test
With Rap pattern parameters I set
Are you deaf? Do you need me to repeat what I said?
I said you'll never be the best unless you pass this test
Okay, fill out registration form 88
Name, social, date of birth, address, city and state
When the form is complete pass it on to Angela Clark
To determine your eligibility and get you insured
Every morning the board panel assembly judges man by his bars
Courage of heart and what he offers the cause
If he's accepted he'll be sworn in tomorrow
If he's rejected he's recycled and retested on stage at the Apollo
I had to and so do you, are you solid or hollow?
Depression is normal, a challenge to climb out of your sorrow
Forget about the world around you, the truth is
They are nothing without you but you will be nothing without the truth

[Hook: Canibus]
A man stays true, a man pays dues
If a man can do this, the man become an angel
There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing

[Canibus]
Do not be confused by the choice of words used
For every battle we win, there's something we lose
But you still have to choose and choosing not to choose is still a choice
Sometimes silence is a powerful voice
The body is of no use if the mind is enslaved
But theses slaves can not bind your light or your sound waves
However, we must to train to increase our strength
The final test is presented when we least expect
We look forward, we see 180 degrees, what's left?
We eyeball right to left but see nothing, what's next?
180 degrees of regret, what's that?
It's everything we left behind unchecked, it wants revenge
They want revenge against us because we fight for our freedoms
Die for what we believe in and they know we don't need 'em
I know you disagree, you think it's fortune cookie shit
But I guarantee you this, our future was prefixed

[Canibus]
I look towards the sky for the answers to why
I analyze the great divide and saw God on both sides
God didn't do this, we did this to each other
So keep his name out your mouth, you fucking cock suckers
How could you own all of it, when we are all apart of this?
The Earth belongs to every living thing that walks upon it
We are all perfect creations, with imperfect justifications
But just the patient fuck the subject of Satan
The Universe is too huge, does Satan live out there too?
Or is he just after me and you?
Believe what you perceive
Look at the Sun, tell what do you see? 360 degrees of light beams
Illuminating Hip Hop, Spitboss'll bag your pops
You ain't ready for the shit that I got
It's called Hip Hop homey, that's the only way that you know me
And knowing people can still be lonely
At the Maharaji spa for the whole week
I just go to sleep because when I wake up I am not an emcee
I get back on the clock when I hear the next beat
I'll write about another century of heat, I'm a beast
