[Intro: Barfly]
These are the facts. In the adversarial theatre of justice there's 3 acts: Act 1 - Pursuit, Act 2 - Interrogation, Act - 3 Punishment
We find our players this night heroes engaged in the rigors of playing out the respective roles of hunter, judge, and executioner. Sorry folks, there's no jury in this scenario

[Verse 1: JFK]
Ready or not I'm huntin' down the most fearsome
Of syndicated criminals ever to formulate an imperial threat
The most hideous yet of all villainous [?] familiar with
It's the hatred of man that collapses buildings
It's the fear in our mind that targets children
And the pain in his heart that forces him up these ceilings
In such a way, killing thy neighborlys and with a sensational feeling
It's almost routine to see a preacher prey on innocent alter boys in a lustful way that syndicates that:
Nobodies safe from this
Primitive beast but anger the streets
With dominion over our own testaments, weak
Indeed
I've captured more than a handful of enemies
Savage and strong, and chemically wrong commitin' penalties
While bringing
Justice to this world takes more than cops
This is hot pursuit for reason interrogatin' your heart can stop

[Verse 2: Onry Ozzborn]
Where were you on the night that every child cried?
Were you hiding in a closet makin' noises to survive?
Tryna find a way to get in to the heads of mankind
Blurred futuristic fetuses melt in the hands of time
What kinda weapon did you use to lacerate?
What kinda words were you speakin' to imitate? Perhaps exaggerate?
What kinda chameleon -amouflage persuasion of dignity gave you the optimism and the symmetry to kill
Billionaires if they happened to look like Bruce Wayne?
I don't believe your alibi, your costume has bloodstains
And the DNA matches that of the good and innocent
I call it my privilege to question and consider it
Mutants and other embodiments of evil, a prequel illusion to all; Villages will seem well
No need to form bazooka this time
It's evident to introduce you to this old testament type of punishment

[*5....4.....3.....2......1*]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I punish you
Slash you with serrated blades
I punish you
Watch your breath fade away
I punish you
Send you to that big pie in the sky
When I'm finished with you, you'll be dyin' to die
Motherfucker I'll demolish you
Steal your corpse from the hospital, smuggle you home and polish you
If I wanna get you, I'll get you with a Daisycutter missile so I don't know why you got a 9 with you
I'll punish you
Slash you with serrated blades
I punish you
Watch your breath fade away
I punish you
Send you to that big pie in the sky
When I'm finished with you, you'll be dyin' to die
I gave you the option, allowed you to choose
Gave you a style you could use
Now you fuckin' with some grimy dudes
Your blood could end up on the bottom of shoes
If you was rich, I still wouldn't share a dollar with you
I didn't know stigmata was true, did you?
I punish you
Take you to the edge of your resolve
Punish you
Present you with a problem that you can't solve
Punish you
Because pain is your guard
I put balls of gauze between your bladder walls
I'll attack you all
Punish you for what you are
Show you what a black hole could do to a star
I'll punish you

[Outro: Barfly]
And so true believers, we see the price of mayhem and ruckus
