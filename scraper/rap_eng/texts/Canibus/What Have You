[Intro: Earl Hazard]

Say Bis
Me know I'm not ready for the fire, zeen
Give 'em that Saddam bomb fire Rude Boy that ruckus
Zeen?

[Verse 1:  Canibus]

Earl Hazard, King of Tallulah
Acronym NWC (is it me?)
Niggas With Computers
Big horn trombone tubas
Ethanol front lawn movers
Catapillars with blowers
Comin' out the hood loofahs
Pink boots not cheap loops
Fire point seat belt harness
Low cage, I don't need no booth
Sheriff Taws, Gregory Peck
My eyes wide open all the time
Even if I know the enemy's dead
Here's the thing Capital C
Close quarters rap with the beat
Music casualties don't matter to me
Can-I-Bus nom de plume
Rip the Jacker rendezvous' is a brave new world
Drop they shoes, it's Headquarters
Sheep to the slaughter
Vinegar IP, no water
Potassium burns your fangs til you holler
Banana man selling bananas
From banana stands in Afghanistan
Part of bananas with the camera man
I'm the hammer man any which way you can
Eastwood Callahan
What's so funny fancy pants?
It's a battle staff warm-up
Reserve contingent callin' em up
Poorly trained, no guts, they all suck
Hot day agalo agalo, plant my plot [?]
Prepare the [?] de el jefe vamanos
I'm a son of a bitch black baboon silver back raccoon
In the shit hit the fan chat room
Uncle Jesse said he'd be back soon before tomorrow afternoon
Don't let him take the flag off his tomb
Holy Kehokian curse
Blood clot five shot burst
What you mean my credit card don't work
I fermented the polly grain
The buzz went straight to my brain
I drank until I can't remember my name
Step up and sign the oar
Hear me roar
I burn the fricking goal post at the score
You little pissant obstructionist
You call that spittin?
Yeah I'm a asshole but at least I'm consistent
Let's expand this idea further
Let's pretend you're the observer
In the front row of my terra dome circus
The worthless plan was young
The man was old
The deal with the devil eternally damned his soul
Cut that God damn check
I rhyme with anything
I'm not being lied to because I am not listening
Multi feathers support
A 16 bar single too short
50 bars, what the fuck you thought
I've got a deep root cellar fresh wine fat rack repellant
To be the best is a fact I embellish
Functional illiteracy, short memory
Eternal periphery
Molon labe life and liberty
Full cycle carbon intensive
With a meaningful message
Still get distracted by beautiful breasts-es
I like my Laverne and Shirley curly curly
My eggs over easy
And turkey bacon burl's handy
TRS 80 Atari [?] combat baby
[?] Kaliko Vision Kwazy!
Watts and Williams
Technology firm worth billions
Strong room big enough to fit buildings
Houses with gold crown molding
Voice command series says "open"
Soldiers standing outside smokin'
Agile inspired approach
I still get hired the most
I need a coast where I can park my boat
The flood waters give me a bath
Five foot alpaca raft
Heavy duty with inflatable pads
I'm clumsy, help me buddy
I gotta save all of my puppies
Two dozen Siberian Huskies
I'm a Main Street insider
Carbon fiber  concrete tiger
I call [?] on fraudulent iris
Positive ID vector
Chief inspectors spit black gold forever
North Dakota to Texas
Close approach, inoculation proximity
Operation microphones
Decomposed to oxidation
And that's just the blood clot basics
You love it or hate it
King of Tallula, Motherfucker, take it

[Hook: Unknown Artist]

I'm resilient with the balls
I just handed a mic
Run for your life
You should save yourself
I just handed a mic
Run for your life
I just handed a mic
Welcome to the Guillotine
Bringin' you that horror nigga, fuck dramaticism

[Verse 2:  Earl Hazard (aka Mr. Burns)]

Hey yo
Smoke a blunt a cigarette and drink a brew before breakfast
Drunk before lunch and walk around like I'm headless
Hip hop scholar not the best that should test this
Cause Burns is a force that you don't want to mess with
What's with the stuntin' dem not know shottas
Got a crew big enough to clock ya stop ya proper
Bout to bring the pain
Bigger than the movie Clockers
And they'll be sick of my name
Til they need to see a doctor
Fat rhymes flat line travelin' at max speed
Metaphors mega roar leaving niggas knock me
Sing a Hail Mary's to the one who's trying to Pac me
Cause Burns got that rock that's top with hip hop steez
Take cover rhymin'  and this live grenade's
Liable to get high in space doctor or toxic waste
The block's hot cops got a Glock to spray food for thought
Copper plate fiends put your rocks away
It's a shame you lames claim to be past due
Get your lips stapled shut and your mask glued
My name rings and reigns supreme
Pash, you fag because I'm king of Tallula, what's happening?

[Hook]

[Verse 3:  Earl Hazard]

Hey doe, hey doe
Yeah, Hazard a baddest soul
Who shattered the masters
With half the master [ ] hoes
So go capture the madness
They lack the this rapper's [ ]scroll
What's ta happen if masters gathered in packs
Defending [ ] and answers 'em back
And he's whack act as if faggot clothes
Will slash you in half with my crack and blast you
And third degree create a murder scene, word
Now every cipher transforms the calisthenic captions
The benefactor's benefactor, bitch remember that one
Lyrical body upper cup can knock your center back
Was trippin' and I'm a make you wish you never finished packin'
To puts money on my head you gonna need plenty Jacksons
Kangaroo language Mr. show you how to kick the action
[Dung Ye Wing Chung?] spit demographics
Match gravity force that should have McGill fracutured
Yeah you get your head in plastic
Got magic liquid you meant to and I don't mean no acid
It ain't just hip hop this Gambino jazz
And rhyme tattered Titan took the skills
There ain't no need for clashin'
Earl Hazard's bring a bastard's body high
To understand you'll probably die
Now what have you

[HOOK]
