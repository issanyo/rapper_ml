[Intro: David Michael Jacobs]
All of this is part of the abduction phenomenon
And not only that, they had unusual marks on their bodies
Scars on their bodies that weren't there literally the day before

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, some say the pen overpowers the sword
The video camera is just as powerful when it records
Appalling footage of cops breakin' the law
Mad at you because of what you saw, now they breakin' ya jaw
I been accused of bein' internally preoccupied
Cause the rhymes talk to me and I talk to the rhymes
Clinically induced impulses reveal what's hidden
Written prescriptions, given by qualified clinicians
Lafayette peg boards be spinnin on turntables
To determine the motor coordination available
Those able to speak what I spoke, repeat my quotes
My systematic treatment approach be deep in they throats
I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose
Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke
Well-spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host
Scale intelligence like Wechsler Adults
Nonnormative data, brain storage matter couldn't capture
A couple years ago they had to put it on Napster
Ressurect Rip the Jacker, rip these rappers
For every second the clock ticks, I'm a attack ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Canibus]
The C-A-N dash I dash
B-U-S gets the last laugh before the critical mass
In half the speed of a bulb flash
Fire engulf that ass into a mole hill of charcoal ash
Only to be blown away by a cold draft
Wack MCs got no chance, it's so sad
They ask Canibus, "Will you ever run out of things to say?
How much breath can a man breathe in a day?"
Needless to say, I think it's kinda deep in a way
People be like "Bis is too ill, keep him away"
It's a good thing I got patience
I've been waitin here longer than Dr. Levinson's time equations
Trying to figure out what made men
Was it inflation or are we just a product of the apes then

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
You think because I'm not on a major I can't bust
And because I come from the ghetto that I can't adjust
Yeah my disposition was rough
But it turned me into a quick learner, all I need now is some luck
I used to be an undisciplined piece of fecal matter
An underdog rapper, but I closed that chapter
I deal wit my adaptive difficulty faster
And question my projected technique as a rapper
I've lost interest in the battle glory and glamour
But I can't control Rip the Jacker when he gets amped up
It doesn't matter, we all got a dark side
A loud mouth Mau Mau from the Apartheid
Yo, you wanna earn your respect then come to micclub.net
And see if you can impress the best

[Hook]
