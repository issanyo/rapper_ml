[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Light speed phonetics ____ practising my breath
Your son was murdered on purpose, no accidental death
He entered my mind unauthorised and got stranded
Was pushed off the top of my thoughts and died before he landed
That's why the ____ flowers are being handed
He planned to drop the gambit and gain an advantage
Meanwhile my mind scares the planet and breaks down the semantics
24 billion miles a second rapper transit
You whisper a verse, I bark it - write, live it and talk it
Harded to remove than ink on white carpet
Assaulted your thought with a sharp hit
____ means morbid 'cause I cough up blackened tabacco dark spit
Doom tonight, predatory natrure when the Moon is right
I'm soon to strike, wild animals dying from human bites
I bruise ____ with weapons you didn't know I used
K-Rino vocally juice food doing ___ moves

[Verse 2: Damo]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Day time, 12 Noon, doom and gloom
Drinking radiated water from a ___ tube
