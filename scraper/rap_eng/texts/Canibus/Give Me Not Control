[Intro]

[Hook: Canibus]
Give me control of all the world's media
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em
Radio, audio, television, video
Satellite, streaming, download, digital
Give me control of all the world's media
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em
Radio, audio, television, video
Satellite, streaming, download, digital

[Verse 1: Canibus]
For the Phoenix to rise, life must die
And that's just how it is sometimes
The narrow path is not always clear cut but don't fear nothing
Good karma will amount to something
The 1990 era was the most special
We took this art form to a whole 'nother level
We had Supreme Knowledge, Hip Hop Temple Stone Pilots
All-seeing eyes with the gold iris
The material world is not always truthful
Everybody can't be a business management guru
Gimme Guinness stout, I sit around the table and Google
Meditate, learn the Metu Neter language from, YouTube
Raw talent force multiplier enforcer
The Universe bleeds from every orifice, I absorb it
Silver garments smell like garlic, camp-fire concert performers
My Last Supper was a cup of cornmeal porridge
The horizon is dark orange, the Phoenix rise, close orbit
I see armies of 9-foot Wookies in the forest
Transcendence, this is artificial dependence
The future is present, my name is Johnny Depp Junior [Jetson]

[Hook: Canibus]
Give me control of all the world's media
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em
Radio, audio, television, video
Satellite, streaming, download, digital

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Jupiter ascending through beautiful hues and color spectrums
The imagery is in the essence
I need not to be reminded how weak the flesh is
When I am hungry, under pressure, distracted and desperate
I say sing for your suppers you miserable tone-deaf motherfuckers
Coz all you do is fight with each other
You misogynist maggot, fifth columnist faggot
You make promises but take the dishonorable passage
I'm like Little Lord Fauntleroy, the honorable boy
Who became a gentleman, time flies, now I'm forty
You feel me? What is it really? What is life really about?
Once you're in it there is only one way out
At the moment the Phoenix rises from the ashes, magic
My quantum cycle continues in infinite patterns
But who knows? I sure don't because in The Symphony
Of The Celestial, a nigga barely mastered one note
White water, black tightrope snap, kayak through tight gap
No map that exists can tell you where I'm at
Kite surfing over the earth, always dropping in early for work
And keep connecting to the listeners through the verse
Cause for the Phoenix to rise, life must die
That's just how it is sometimes
The narrow path is not always clear cut but don't fear nothing
Good karma will amount to something
Wait for the Phoenix to rise, open your eyes
Time flies, it'll be here before you realise
Signature signs of the end times, one through centillion rhymes
The Phoenix rise, run for your carbon-based lives

[Hook]
Control the whole world's media
Why would you care who they choose to let entertain 'em?
Radio, audio, television, video
Satellite, streaming, download, digital
Give me control of all the world's media
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em
Radio, audio, television, video
Satellite, streaming, download, digital
Give me control of all the world's media
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'them

[Outro]
