They gonna handcuff ya
Cold War veteran
Youthful with several weapons for the Kremlin
Disciplined like Olympic gold medalists
Remember this
Never ever dick protection-less
Cause nowadays what you could catch is very infectious
Unless you got a death wish
And you want to mess with
Women who poison the walls of they rooms with asbestos
Each stitch is treacherous
Listen to me when I tell you this
Whatever you trying to buy
Somebody is selling it
Somewhere, somehow you get gunned down
When the guns go "blou"
Just cause you was running your mouth
All my people in Toronto sayin' no doubt
You a punk
Stop frontin' and put the gat down
Kick a rap now
Let me see if you can freestyle
Throw in a gat now
Let me show you how to black out
Next year you be walkin' round and how can I be down Pompous when they're lammin' it
