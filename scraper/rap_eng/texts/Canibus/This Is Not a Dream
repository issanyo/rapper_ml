This is not a dream
Not a dream
We are using your brain's perceptual system as a receiver
We are unable to transmit through conscious neurointerference
You are receiving this broadcast as a dream
We are transmitting from the year 3999
You are receiving this broadcast in order to alter the events you are seeing
Our technology has not built to transmit a strong enough to reach your conscious state of awareness
But this is not a dream
Your scene is actually occurring
For the purpose of causality violation
This broadcast will be received by the perceptual centres as a dream
But this is not a dream
