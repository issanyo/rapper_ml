[Intro]
Most of you are poorly informed about...
Little time left to prepare

[Hook: Canibus]
It's little time left to prepare, it's little time left to prepare
It's little time left to prepare
They wanna know how come I show them right here, yeah
It's little time left to prepare, Rip the Jacker
It's little time left to prepare, Rip the Jacker
It's little time left to prepare, it's little time left to prepare
It's little time left to prepare
They wanna know how come, I show them right here yeah

[Verse 1: Canibus]
As the universe expands
I contemplate whether it was Canibus or c0mpl3x that made man
Sometimes I wonder how come we can't live without guns
What would of been the outcome if the South won
Think about that son
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm
The federal communications commission
Listens to politicians in the position to make certain decisions
Like putting minorities in prison
To decimating the population of women, it's called socialism
From the United States to the United Kingdom
I mega mix to A beat till the Moon leaks blood, now what?

[Hook: Canibus]

[Verse 2: Canibus]
And as globalism expands
I recognize several disparities that exist between modern man
When I was young, I was intellectually outgunned
It took some time to figure out how it was done
The concept of love think about that one
The absence of it got human beings fighting over crumbs
The general rejuvenation admission uses proof of statistics
Standard encryptions to keep the truth hidden
Like a bunch of male chauvinist bigots
Confederates hate niggas
And they take orders from right-wing lizards
Who support wicked, indignant, corrupt politicians
To mislead the system and miseducate children
It stopped raining, the roof top drip dropped draining
I look out the window, forever tainted
The worlds in trouble we pray to save it
There's blood on the pavement
They claimed violent crime, drug related
The poor people can't afford payments
And when you look across the board it's all the same shit, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Color doesn't divide us, just injustice and silence
One good man is robbed of his promise
The Nazarene dream like little league softball teams
Good Morning Vietnam, the time is now 11:53
Goldberg Just reported, my verse was retarded with vampire garlic
And verbal vitriolic backed up by so much knowledge
With so many bars to process
1 minute till midnight that gives you about
30 seconds to live right so just sit tight
30 seconds on the buzzer, the president says you rich motherfuckers better pay capital gains to the public
It's only fair but they don't wanna share
Poor people starving everywhere but they don't care
Yeah, I live in the greatest country on the globe
But NO every man is not equal, not even close
(not even close, but maybe just a little bit)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Canibus]
The global money saga, angels, demons, cops, and robbers
We got many problems in common with the old timers
Ownership of the soul, the keyword is control
I don't even wanna be in that mode but who does?
The mental slave, the slave that can spell his own name
But can't see through this belicos game
Sabotaged deceit gunned down in the street
Systemically murdered then hung from a tree
Now that's what we call a fait accompli
I just rap to the beat, look what they've done to me
Wow my pen pal is the DuJAL
He say I'm foul because he think I took his lyrical style
But my style is my own, the fear of God purified my tone alone
Writing poems in my Uruguay home
Gotta be grateful to have a roof over my head
And that your family is sustainably fed
Hip Hop is boastful pride we hide our emotional side
Rip you up like a dry water slide, cuz

[Hook]

[Outro]
I tell them to look in 2 mirrors and witness infinity
Rip The Jacker 2: Infinity
