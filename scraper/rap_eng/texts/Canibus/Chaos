[Verse 1] *acapella*
Yo yo yo
Now ain't nobody fuckin wit the mastermind
I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified
Nicola Tesla an', Jon Von Neuman
All wrapped up in the body in one human
I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest
I blind the optic fibers in anybody's iris
When it comes to rappin, I'll smash your ass
Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon
I'll smack you wit a backhand
That crack your back like chiropractors after looking at your CAT scan
In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman
And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fighting a war
Throwing lightning rods, swinging lightning swords
Blow you away with a force that'll leave your body lost
Gone, nothin to mourn, nothing to do a autopsy on
I rock till I can't rock no more
Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more
Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour
Till 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more
I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grinding
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
I slap fire at a hoodlum, pull out steel and start shooting
I clap iron like Duke Nukem
Try to attack 'Bis, you get your face stomped
Flatter than a compact disc wit black Timbs
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
Flatter than the knife *Jigga* stabbed Un wit

[Hook]
If you the first nigga that laugh
I'll blow you in half
The first nigga to talk trash
I'ma blow you in half
The first nigga to show your ass
I'll blow you in half
The first time'll be your last
'Cause I'ma blow you in half

[Verse 2]
Yo check it
I destroy a whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not
Magnetically energy propagates in radio waves
Oscillating lyrics and beats copulate then pop your tape
Manipulating space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talkin
About shit like supernatural forces
Gnomes and fairies and superstring theories
Most of you motherfuckers barely
Even understand the English language, much less think clearly
When I die, will I go to Heaven or Hell
Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen Belt
I researched my roots, looking for proof
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast
When the average death sentence becomes a death paragraph
I dig a 5 by 9 rectangle in the grass
Read your epitaph and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll sing all of your greatest hits oldies on karaoke

Chorus 2x
