[Canibus]
Those of you who fail to prepare, well now you must prepare to fail
It doesn't matter what your desire entails
I sit around the table with me ale
As I sip from the grail, "Barkeeper bring another pale"
Here's a gold coin and some wisdom for you little girls and boys
Rip the Jacker's coming out of that void
And when he arrives you're going to see the fire in his eyes
He will help you uncover all of the lies
The lies that were told and spread across the globe
To enslave mankind until the end of time
The leprechaun carrying his own megagrammaton
Megalodon transforming words with his energon
There's no substitute for it, indeed he is one of a kind
Rip the Jacker and his Infinite Rhyme

[Canibus]
Nineteen planets and 38 moons
A tabernacle room with 38 tombs
Lazor beam rap flow, shove this J.O.B
Take this anti-cathode and shove it down your rat hole
You dirty, stinking, disgusting crackhead troll
You ain't shit, how many raps you wrote?
You sit there on a computer and doodle, rhyming noodles with goo-goo
You ostracised anybody that knew you
As the world turns daily, they use you
Fast talk and lose you, you waiting for that ___ on YouTube
You now rocking with the best, best, best
I put Rap to the test, test
Canibus the rapper, the vet, Rip the Jacker the master, the myth
Experimenting with the Backster effect
Naturally they water me, I grow, they irritate me, I explode
A dozen albums deep why is that a joke?
From Apollo 11 to moon base 12
I transport you from Hell on Earth to space Hell
I speak at frequencies frequently speaking, Translate the Phoenician
Heart beat increasing, the translator starts wheezing
Analytically speaking
Ten million bars of lithium depletion is the reason I beat him
To advertise is not wise, these wack niggas bite my rhymes
Waste time and compromise lives
The consequence of my belief system, nah G you tripping
They don't even understand what you spitting
Trial prep possess style in depth
I'm 10,000 rhymes and running and I ain't even freestyled yet
Full capability prototype, the pop killer poltergeist
I rap for real, you post on a site
Tell my why you ignore it, try it, you'd probably enjoy it
What's the point if you dying to avoid it?
I quantum leap into the beat
10,000 molecules meet, this ain't for the average MC
Memories of the future, penalties of the past
The righteous will never venture down that path

[Canibus]
The rough cold holds of the grumpy old man
He exists beyond machines, dreams and programs
The NWO plans you stand for they physical scam
They sold they soul, now they wanna go H.A.M
I'm protected by the blood of the lamb
They running for they lives covered by the mud of the land
Fuck that, my fans call me a stubborn old man
Lock and load, lick shots until my gun bolt jam
Radio control D.O.D. drones with both hands
Scrambled eggs, raisin toast and a bowl of old bran
I'm the Hip Hop G.O.A.T
I ain't got to prove shit no more cause they know that I am
GrandWizard Master trap you like Alaskan crabbers
Nasty bastard, I smash you in a spam of cabbage
Haters can't stand it, 10,000 bars too much to manage
Motherfuckers can't even understand it
Contact Schrodinger's cat, Canibus the rapper owns rap
Only a handful of people know that
Yeah, I'm writing, rhyming, vocalling and vibing
Dragons watching the Phoenix fly over the horizon
My high altitude EMP eludes hot pursuit
EPMD, Mic Doc in the booth
You talking to me? Nah, I ain't talking to you
Your label treats you like a Hip Hop prostitute
I got juice, dry socks and boots
The industry crucified Hip Hop, 2Pac is proof
I don't know what I don't know, but god-damn-it I know how to flow
And that's all I ever need to show
Speak, spoke a decision you made on your own
The weight of the world versus the weight of your poems
The main area of operations is chosen
Take two teams and call me when you get to the opening
August 11, 1973
Hip Hop done gave birth to the first MC
The master Rip the Jacker, the microphone controller clashing
Slang slashing, I'm shinobi assassin
Irregular programming, thermal scope scanning, holding a cannon
Heat resistant clothes found between your bone fragments
The metaphor tactician, edit chief with the lyrics
Any word that you ever wanted to visit
I rip shows, establish foothold from get-go
Show you how to flow, show you how this rap shit goes
I loved Hip Hop from the beginning, back when it had no limit
Back spinning to new galactic beginnings
I love it, I live it, I wouldn't give it up for a minute
Every minute of spitting they miss hundreds of lyrics
