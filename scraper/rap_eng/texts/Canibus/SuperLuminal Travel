(Verse 1)

Looking skyward calculating 2012
The global system will be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet commander complex in a starship
Looking for a place to park it
They detane anonymous hackers for fighting federal contractors
Cause they looking like androgynous rappers
I chase em entrap em detail in the action
For try to desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master
Fast acting bio hazard my verses a surface burst blasting
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapses
Beyond the absence of light is all blackness
The ships are metallic the engines are magnets
The motors the magic
I build the sliver disc in a cabin
In the labyrinth of the enchanted
Where air quality is unbearably rancid
From a ripper slasher slashing all you fucking fagots

(Hook)

Superluminal Travel 3x
Faster than the speed of light
Superluminal Travel 3x
Glowing all through the night
Superluminal Travel 3x
From point A to point C
Superlumainal Travel 3x
Ain't a damn thing faster than me

(Verse 2)
Cog nits of saturation I race to the sun
Than got back before the competition even began
It all started at one now look what we done
Just kick back release little pieces for fun
You couldn't even fly a kit in my airstrip (nooo nigga)
The airspace right there for the league team
You on your last leg don't try to chase me
Motherfucker infinity growing at light speed
(Cut school) tech bone drag em thru I'm connect bones
Rock em from the pressure of the depth
Test calibrated spec weapons check correct
You don't want war with complex
Im the mixing board Optimus Prime
I came here from an advanced time
And help the world discover advance rhymes
Kill a Decepticon with the power of my mind
Then bend the fabric of space and travel a straight line

(Hook)

Superluminal Travel 3x
Faster than the speed of light
Superluminal Travel 3x
Glowing all through the night
Superlumial Travel 3x
From point A to point C
Superlumial Travel 3x
RTJ2 to infinity

(Verse 3)

The dragon will be delayed a few days during the testing phase
Of the fully automated RTJ
They say the whole world will die
When two atomic mosquitoes collide
Not even the size of a gap fly
Why is eagle eye giving me bad vibes
I was born to rhyme everybody knows this is my pastime
Every bar I record is absorbed by a robot Borg
They make more while I'm out on tour
Do you know the machine monitor me for 30 years
And even suggest the ear wax growing from my dirty ears
Two verses against one not fair Canibus raps everywhere
And right now he's not here
He doesn't care you will not be spared
Rip the robot will hunt all down by the layers
I didn't create it I wrote a little code but they made it
Hows that for a duppy Jamaican
With superluminal spaceship coordinating acoustic levitation
For my RTJ2 geostasis
My tranquility module is so spacious
In exile my only crime is my imagination
Imagination encircles the world
Superb these were not my but Einstein words
My work is highly touted
The mainstream media don't write about it
So why is my laboratory so crowded
I know where to turn trust no one comes from
You can't unlearn what can not be undone
I tell you what its about and you don't have enough appendages
To count how many times they never let it out
First of all UFOs are not even real
And if they were they wouldn't be shaped like wheels
How can they be coming out hollow earth of the ocean
When publicly there isn't prove of there propulsion
My superluminal user-friendly computer is irrefutable
Who the hell you want me to prove it to
Aliens in absentia on a ten thousand bar adventure
Too many album songs to mention
Its inherently natural to smoke trees in a space capsule
Right before superluminal travel
My radar range radical is behaving irrational
I manually self correct my longitude and latitude
Payload heavy steady tell Santa Claus Canibus ready
To start searching for SETI
Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battle rip the jacker to infinity

(Hook)

Superluminal Travel 3x
Faster than the speed of light (Complex killers)
Superluminal Travel 3x
Glowing all through the night
Superluminal Travel 3x
From point A to point C
Superluminal Travel 3x
Ain't a damn thing faster than me
