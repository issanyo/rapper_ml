[Canibus]
Yo why you got so much hatred?
Why you don't want me to make it?
What are you afraid of?
You treat me like I'm not a member of the rap game club
Yo I sold a million records too, I don't get the same love
It's strange because the majors already drained my pockets
And now they wanna drain my blood
Do you have any idea of what I did to get here? Do you?!
You can smell the hatred in the atmosphere
This record is livin proof that I've made it
And you're listening to it now, and it's on an independent label
You like Canibus? Yeah right, if you say so
Talk to Louie Lombard, he'll put you on the payroll
When you see me on the street now, I probably really glow
Nothin like some of these wack rappers that are really broke
I can laugh at a meaningless joke, but I got a daughter to feed
Don't hate me cuz I'm competin bro
I'm doin it all by myself
And as long as I'm on the shelf, I'm always have wealth
This is what motivated microphone FIENDS do
And it's ok if you hate me cuz I hate you too

[Hook]
Is the reason why you keep callin my name out of the blue
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!

I hate your style, when I see you I wanna hurl
I should do somethin real foul, like get at your girl
Make your heart throb, take a hooptie and smash your parked car
Run up in your favorite night club, get you barred (Fuck outta here!!)
Why you like to hate stars? Why you talkin in riddles?
Me losin is the only way to get you to giggle
You pitiful motherfucker, you gon' stay in the gutter
I can see you at 33 and still be livin with your mother
I'm sick of you clowns runnin around, hatin on Rippers
You see me in the street, act like your mouth got a zipper
Aiyyo don't say a word faggot cuz it's already proven
Keep it movin, you ain't FUCKIN up this new shit I'm doin
I'm tryin to keep a space between me and you, like gapped teeth
To avoid catchin cases for lettin the gat speak
I ain't never got a problem to meet on a backstreet
In a black hoodie, new mac-milli, now act silly
You can hate me forever, I'ma always be makin moves
Don't be mad cuz I'm a leader, a Ripper that breaks rules
It's a shame what hate's makin individuals do
Don't forget the bottom line is that I hate you too

[Hook]
Is the reason why you keep callin my name out of the blue
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!
