(Canibus)

These external layers expose the internal affairs
The midwife delivered a divine prodigy with white hair
The light bearer the golden era joint task
Fight force terror take flight in poor weather
By decree, by decree at the emcee who spits by the sea
The illest lyricist nobody can beat
Fire breathing beast smell like burnt tonsils and teeth
Try to scream your body will be cremated by the heat
Try to beef you secrete a red substance on the street
Dump you in the ocean the ocean will dump you on the beach
The only thing we got in common
A lot of motherfuckers going to be crying
When the EKG go silent
Crucifix pain I bomb it then launch another rocket
St. Germaine co-signed it then we both go Atomic
In the rainforest with a rifle and rangefinder
A burlap sack and a rack-mounted analyser
Taking hip-hop for hostage
My zero tolerance policy put pressure on the pussy who pops shit
You want it edited or do you want me to shred it rip
Where’s your spitboss membership? We’ll talk in a minute kid
We talk about problems, what you going to do to solve em
Even so, how you gonna stop them
Moving on your living and your dead
Like a giant Jurassic Rasta with dreads with a million spider legs!
