[Canibus]
That's it's that's it automatic
That's it Rip The Jacker interact with this Rap shit
Collaboration madness yields action, action
Action, action, action!
Spectators have no patience and high expectations
They just see the end result, they don't know the basics
We old and ancient seraphim salutations
The octaves are active, I've mastered the Matrix
Musical note placement, every eight bars a tracer
Every sixteenth bars a laser
Tactical applications, deeper than the _____
Thumb bases at a dozen locations
Dead man walking pneumonia, put that stank on ya
You want fame or misfortune I'ma show ya
Emotion manifest thoughts, thoughts are impulsive
Action is added on, there's an explosion
The fallout residue is lyrically corrosive
Select ya elements, side-spit with the dopest
That's It, Rip the Jacker on some Canibus shit
The magnetic shift, the planet will flip
That's it!
