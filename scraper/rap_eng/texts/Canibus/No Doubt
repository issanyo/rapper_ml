No question, kid, no doubt, check it
I'ma break it down and let you know what I'm about

[Canibus]
I splatter your brain-matter
The quick [draw mcgore jaw tapper?]
My lines hit harder than pissed-off line backers
So exercise caution, I shatter jaws like porcelain
Fuck around and get your life-span shortened, 'cause I'm the ultimate evil
Terrorizing people
I hand-cuff your neck to moving vehicle
Then I put your block scene on-lock like a swat team, 'cause I'm toting four-pound Glocks with infrared beams
It seems so stupid that you want to battle us when we know rhymes like Einstein knows calculus
So don't be doubting my shit, 'cause I'm the Canibus
And I got more lines than a million Kay Swiss
Without a question; without a shadow of a doubt, I'll kill the last dragon and drink the last Dragon Stout
Niggas be running off with the mouth, but they just cowards afraid of my powers, I make niggas piss in they trousers

[] I walk through the valley of the death
'Cause I'm living in hell, like [] chef
Plus, I'm quick to bring the pain like meth
And then, when I let my vocal chords expand, aw damn
When I murder tracks to label casualties of war, I hit the floor like Thor god and shakes the Earth's core
[Charred?], I'm aiming for you dome, so up your guard
Like credit-card fraud,I leave the economy scarred
'Cause fuck going straight, I make it crooked like extortion
You want to act fool, I'll blow this shit out of proportion
True that, my verbal quality is like that
Forty-eight bits of that uncensored rap
The type of shit that underground niggas live for
The type of shit that blows the fucking hinges off the door
So lets go to war, I'm ready for battle, surrender
See I can break it down from January through December
And I can rhyme, beats with rhymes, like a blender
And flip verses, like counterfeit legal tenders
So X marks the spot, give me the signal and I'll bomb it
Niggas come talking shit, but leave the battle catatonic
So proceed with caution, 'cause I bring it to your melon
With rhymes undestructible, like wolverine skeletons
See, this ain't no nickel and dime game anymore
Niggas is ants, and ready to bring it to your jaw

Who the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfucking brain is IBM compatible
My techniques Techniques are foreign, far from the borin'
My style is hard like Castle without McCormick
I run through your crew like the flu, dog gon it
My style is like AIDS: niggas don't want it
Niggas be fronting like they hard
But I'm a Street Fighter like Jean Claude and I'll split your shit, par
Right down the middle then play you like a fiddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
I trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
With the burner I murder anything that bleeds
Ambushing niggas from the trees like Vietnamese
Wild, always on-point like a projectile
I'm kidnapping niggas like the aliens on X-Files
With styles, I got more than you realize
And I'm making niggas with amnesia recognize
That I'm getting first-prize in '95
And I'll smoke a blunt with Elvis if he's still alive

I cock my [?] back like a gun and drink a glass of red rum and make your whole crew pause like DMC and DJ Run
I rolled up on shawty like a Camaro
And if their friend is with it, no question, I'll get more than them like sparrows
Let me get down for my hometown, New York
No move, making them out to make the 'bakin'' like some pork
But I don't eat it, but if it's needed I'll get weeded
You went against the number one competitor and got defeated
But don't get mad 'cause I bagged your shawty like Glad
No need to get upset over some pussy you never had
I bring it to your chest and cause cardiac arrest
So caress the finesse 'cause I freak it like good sex
I tote mics at my side 'cause it comes in handy
So I can bring it to fake niggas who want to be down like Brandy
So what? I come off my skull and flip a scripture
And make you jump straight out of your seat like something bit ya
