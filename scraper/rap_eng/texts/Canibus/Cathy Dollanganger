[Intro: Canibus]
Uh, and another one
That's right, Jonathan, you my brother, son

[Verse 1: Frida Dee]
Standing outside, waiting for a sign
People passing by, but I know
It's time
Tryna be what I'm not
But I'm still in the shadow from the rest of them
I'm not the same
You don't know where I'm comin' from
How's my background, is my momma proud
What's the difference? Oh
What's the difference? Oh
Tell me to go and out myself
To be somethin' great, well that's not a chance
I'm just a flower, in the attic
Tryin' to survive, to survive

[Verse 2: Canibus]
Sittin' in the cave composed of amethyst
My brain cells exposed to cannabis
This is about more than bein' talented
I've experienced full-blown avarice (watch this)
If you a flower, I'm the soil beneath you
The nutrient rich roots that feed you
Terra preta forever, tellin' you I never felt better
Thirty-two bars of some cheddar
The scent of a rose, flowers in a foxhole trench
Cold, scared, naked to the elements
You know what they say, "All the cosmos is a stage"
And these are the words of a sage
Flowers in the attic with CGI imagery graphics
My reality finna be magic
I be the first one to tell you, I don't know how it's goin' down
I just know how it's not goin' down
'round and 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Since you just posted it, everybody know
('round and 'round and 'round and 'round we go)
(Since you just posted it, everybody know)
A sardonic response to add to a somber ambiance
With a one-legged man, let's dance
Have a glass of peach, apple and pear brandy
And some potato vodka, here, family
I made it myself, she looked me in the eyes and thanked me
She said the flowers looked like candy
Now where the fuck is my Grammy?
How come I don't get no Grammy?

[Chorus]
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic

[Verse 3: Vito Banga]
Precious Lord, take my hand
To overcome this, it's gon' to take strength
God, I didn't finish college, got a backstreet degree
So as I wade through the water, watch over me
My step-father can't read, mama got one lung
And bills tend to weigh in with a so-so income
And rap where I'm from, there's tax on that
It brings me down some, Lord, I got problems
I put it out for my kids, and motivation like this
[?] I feel, let's get this shit clear
Nappy Roots is my lifeline, Scales used to say things
To keep me in my right mind, just at the right time
Keep the wind at my back, and a face full of sunshine
Punch the clock, rise 'til quittin' time
I've seen a lot of things go wrong, I'm just woke minded
I'm just woke minded, I'm just woke minded

[Verse 4: Caskey]
It's like a flame, secluded in the dark
That's me, alludin' to the arts
See, we came from the luminous park
My sunshine turned to rain and abuse from the start
I graduated from a school of argue, already know the tale
The world drained me of life, I turned pale
And though I tried to put sand in the bucket
I never could afford me a rubber or band so, man, fuck it
I'm a lost cause, playa
If it wasn't for rap, I'd be out fuckin' with the cops all day
Heavy metal Glock, all slayer
Can't afford to drown, hit you for the quarter pound, broad day
What guitar player ever hit chords without struggle?
You wouldn't know what rift to play
So consider what you fear and loathe to be a gift, that's it
Just don't let your talent drift away
Everything that shine ain't bright
And everything that glitter ain't gold
Just water me a flower only bloom when it's sunny outside
And they lie, don't believe what you told
I came through from the struggle

[Chorus]
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic
I've got one flower
I've got one flower in the attic
