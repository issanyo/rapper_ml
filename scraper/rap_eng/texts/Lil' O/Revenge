(*talking*)
Ha-ha, money's good, ha-ha
Bitches is crazy, but you know what
Ain't nothing sweeter than revenge
Feel me (feel me)

[Hook]
I've been waiting for the day, I can get my revenge
Now my money right, nigga I'm a made man
To let shit ride, wasn't never in the plan
Whoever did me wrong, I'll pay em back times ten

[Poppy]
I was treated like rubbers, I was used and threw away
It's hard knowing my dogs, wanna do me away
See we was close, and man that's what really hurts the most
See I was short of roast, if I wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost
See we was kin folk, now what was between us is jeopardized
You crossed Poppy, now I'm peeping your weakness like leopard eye
Should I let him slide, forgive him let God step inside
But we better collide, severe our ties and let him fry
And show him it's real, we heathen up a slow in his grill
Or let him make it, even though I know I owe him the steel
The Devil's tempting me, to let these niggas know how I feel
But I won't never have peace, within my soul if I kill
You know the deal, my mind keeps painting dramatic scenes
Cause my friends basically did me, with no Vaseline
But I'm the raw cat, niggas who want static bewteen
Cause testing me, is like smoking while bathing in gasoline

[Godfather]
It wasn't really nice, I got a car on my motor
My nigga screaming through the phone, said he sold a soda
Said the product wouldn't sell, like there's no promoters
Every graham straight vanished, like hocus pocus
These are dope back, besides Hector know that
Bout my money, have his family kissing Kodak's
With ten bricks in the Benz 6, I'm well connected
Motorized stash spot, no smell detected
It's getting hectic, I got the power like snap
I was a ghetto chemist, who turned powder to crack
I need revenge, cause this was passed over due
Revenge, if it's the last thing I do
Revenge, silencers no sound
Revenge, what goes around comes around
Revenge is sweet, revenge is just a part of the streets
He made it harder, for my daughter to eat

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
When they said you was a snitch, I should of cracked your jaw
Put a bat to your cranium, and cracked your skull
But I trusted you, I was like that's my brah
We grew up together, he would never rat to laws
You called and asked for raw, said you need it non-soft
I dropped it off and left, but before I got far
Laws hopped out, yelling stop the car
And if you try something fly, we gon stop your heart
You set the trap, nigga I'ma get you back
You like a soldier with no gun, you need protection black
Right when you think it's all good, and ain't expecting that
I'ma pop up in your rear, and go and split your hat
Mafia style, kill you in front your wife and your child
Ask em how they want you done, cooked spicy or mild
Laugh loud while I watch the slugs, slicing you down
And I'ma celebrate go wild, and have a night on the town bitch

[Hook - 2x]
