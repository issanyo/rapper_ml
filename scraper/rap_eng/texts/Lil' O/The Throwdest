[Lil' O]
And another one, and another one
And another one, and another one

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce - 2x

[Big Moe]
Boy it sure shows, that you're so throwed
And the way you walk, and the way you talk
And the way you step in, all the boppers fall
It shows, that you're so throwed

[Lil' O]
You know I skate through slow, in a gray two do'
Gold diggers yelling, ooh I hate you O
Cause I won't even pay, for no H2O
You broads want a drink, the bathroom got a sink
But do I got dough, you ain't got to think
Cause when winter time came, bitch I bought the mink
And when I wanted ice, I went and got the crossing link
And when you look at my wrist, bitch you got to blink
I'm the throwdest, getting cold like slurpees
I got dick sucking hoes, that gobble like turkeys
Bad broads, that eat my ass like jerky
From Houston Texas, to Albuquerque
When I think how you pay these broads, it hurts me
When will you suckers learn, these boppers are skirts free
I bet when it's dropped, it's contreversy
But these chickenheads still, gon pimp me like bird seeds

[Hook: Carmen Santiago & (Lil' O)]
Ooh Lil' O, you don't play no games
You throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And I seen you pull up hopping, out the big black Range
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And baby money ain't a thang, cause you keep you some change
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And you got ice from your neck, to your wrist, to your ring
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)

[Poppi]
Because I ball, they wanna get they buns in a licks
Thinking I'ma be the one, to trick hunds for the Six
All on my nuts, they know about the funds I could lick
And my jewels shine, like I got the sun on my neck
We so hot the streets sweat, when we come on the set
For pocket change, I got em up from budget to bitch
Your main squeeze, say she only like to run with the best
And peep it dog, that's why she want me under her dress
That's how we ball, Dubs on Coupes is how we crawl
And my bracelet, will make your body temperature fall
I got enough game, to talk virgins out they draws
Now these boys wanna take my spot, because I'm raw
They start cuffing broads, when I step out the car
Mad cause they know, I'm about to buy the bar
I'm a superstar, that's why they women bought me
From Booshwau to Dice, they be like ay Poppi, cause I'm throwed

[Hook: Carmen Santiago & (Poppi)]
Ooh Poppi, you don't play no games
You throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And I seen you pull up hopping, out the big black Range
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And baby money ain't a thang, cause you keep you some change
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And you got ice from your neck, to your wrist, to your ring
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)

[Chris Ward]
I know fa sho, you seen Chris in a drop
V-12, C-L 6 hundred, missing the top
I got you dazed and amazed, wishing to bop
Hopping out in Iceberg, bitch I'm sizzling hot
The only thing about me cool, is my icy jewels
Like a buttoned up silk shirt, I'm nice and smooth
You think Stella's throwed, I got twice the groove
I'm a ignorant, arrogant, trifling dude
I make a broad eat dick, do street shit
Sleep on bricks, just to be my bitch
Cause I'm throwed, like a pass from Cunningham
I get compliments, for how stunny I am
Hoes always wanna pose, in front of my Lam-
Borgini in they bikini, saying I'm one of your fans
Everytime I spit a rhyme, they be like whoa (god damn)
As if I burnt they mouth, with a piece of hot ham

[Hook: Carmen Santiago & (Chris Ward)
Ooh Chris boy, you don't play no games
You throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And I seen you pull up hopping, out the big black Range
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And baby money ain't a thang, cause you keep you some change
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
And you got ice from your neck, to your wrist, to your ring
You the throwdest (yeah I know bitch)
