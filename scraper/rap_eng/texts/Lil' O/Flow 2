Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, I'm back baby
I'm feeling like Rocky Balboa man
I'm in the best shape of my life, boys asking
Ay O where you been, hey man I've been balling man
I ain't finna lie to you, but peep this
I'm back in the kitchen, I got this A-1
I know y'all boys tired of all this bullshit on the streets
Let me go ahead and give you what you want

[Lil' O]
Ay top down, chrome spinning
Fuck all these bitch niggas, skinning and grinning
You ain't gotta like O, Lil' O's still winning
And I'm still, fucking all your women
Getting plenty of paper, think I'm done I got plenty of capers
And I'm feeling like, one of the Lakers
I'm on the strongest team, I'm like dro I belong with green
You ain't built for this do', you all wrong with green
You wouldn't know, what to do with it
You'd prolly buy a Escalade trick it off, fuck around and let your boo get it
But me a stone, flip a brick so fast
Hit the motherfucking bird, gon catch whiplash
Then I flip it, and do it again
Pull up in that X-5 truck, in front of you and your friends
Like sucker, this European
And no it is not a mirage, what you are seeing
I'm on 20 inch chrome, Johnnie diamonds on
Gat in my drawas, nigga leave me alone
Pull a bitch with a ass, you gotta squeeze in a thong
And she love all the Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, lil' songs
I'm the one, nigga like 10 minus 9
And my neck to your neck, got ten times the blind
My wrist to your wrist, got ten times the shine
And the 8'll set you straight, if you get out of line
Niggas acting like O, won't light they mouth
Do a drive-by ride-by, ignite they house
And if they bitch jump in, I'ma fight they spouse
This is war, let me show you what this life's about
Nigga moving thangs, packing pistols
Watch out for jackers, them boys will get ya
Nigga get ya cash, make these boys respect ya
And ball till you fall, or the FED's come get ya nigga whoa

[Hook]
When the last time, you heard it like this
Niggas rapping bout, moving them bricks
Fucking hoes, and stacking them chips
It's Lil' O nigga, whoa
So only if, you know you're live
From the North, to the Southwest side
How many bricks, can you fit in that ride
Get on ya grind nigga, whoa

(*talking*)
