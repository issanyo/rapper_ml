[Chorus 2X: ESG]
Bend ya knees, touch ya toes
And who ever don't like it tell em
"Fuck you hoes"
Now shake ya hips give it all ya can
Tell them hata brawds, "bitch, i'll take ya man!"

[Lil' O]
Say girl, ya lookin too clean
Bowlegged in your iceberg jeans
You little jazzy thang, you done wrecked the scene
And the way you shake your ass, I know it sexes me
That why them hatin ass hoes be mad at chu
Cause you shake yo thang with attitude
They mad cause they ain't as bad as you
???????? and they grab at chu
You ain't worried bout yo man
You just on the floor
But the way you dance boo
You puttin on a show
Cause all the guys be like "hold up whoa!"
And all the girls be,"let's jump that hoe!"
Don't let them stop ya
Do yo thang girl, you will be proper
Heart stopper, face cute
Ass lookin proper, cause those brawds can't knock ya
So just...

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Stop, drop, move ya hips
See any brawds twist, they can do that shit
Fuck a lolly-pop girl, you'd be licked
But playas get chose, now who ya wit
Cause you know that I want that
That's why you bendin over,shakin, and you taunt that
Plus you know you got a chest, so you flant that
Plus you know that I'm gone on the koniac
I'm fucked up
Now you met a baller tonight, you lucked up
The girl I came with, I told her, "tuff luck"
You act ? post and stuck up
I need a hot girl in my life, I want her
Met her at the bar wit her mouth wide open
Eyes blood-shot, red nose, in there smokin
Said,"why she lookin at me all heart broken?"
Forget her, I got your back
So just...

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now I know how yall say I'm wrong
But I couldn't help to think bout baby in a thong
I ain't gonna lie shorty got it goin on
????????????????
That shows right there how throwed she is
Thermistat couldn't tell her how cold she is
Then she did the splits like an olympicists
Started laughin at my date, she a bowler bitch
Don't do it like that girl
You gonna make her start shootin off her gat girl
Cause when she mad, she don't know how to act girl
But you my boy, so I have to give you dab girl
Do your thang just...

[Chorus]

[Lil' O]
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick
Now baby dip, baby dip
Like you want me to trick baby, trick

[Chorus]
