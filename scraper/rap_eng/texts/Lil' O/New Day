[Verse 1: Macc Grace]
Being back, I reminisce with click in Greenstone
It was just a dream of me to wreck, the microphone
Freestyling over beats, all night no sleep
Another day, another dub acting bad for the streets
It was me, P.A.T, Big Hawk, and Lil Ke
L.O.S., Big Poke, E.S.G, and M.O.E
Can’t forget Al-D, Big Jut, and Papi
Randy, Rhino, Clay-Doe, and Mike D
Man who would ever thought hood stars from the block
Would be the ones on the stage making crowds body rock
3-2 was at the lot but then he came back home
That was about the same time Ro and O came along
Through the years we lost bills, we shedded a few tears
To this day we hit the stage and still receive cheers
It’s a brand new day, and though a lot of things change
Screwed Up Click still here acting bad on the game

[Chorus]
It’s a new day
Can’t none stop us from shining
No way
Its cause the Click is still grinding
Yeahhhh
Screwed Up Click is here to stay

[Verse 2: Mr. 3-2]
Remember back in the day? At Screw’s house
Making grey tapes, till we all passed out
In the wood room, gone off drugs
Nothing but true love for my G’s and thugs
Shorty Mac, Al-D, and the boy P.A.T
Real official members of the S.U.C
Now’s a new day and were all on a mission
Some in studios and some in the kitchen
Whipping up grams, trying to feed the fam
Do what you got to, but you got to be a man
Damn, its feels hard to survive in the game
In the, fast lane, trying to keep my sane
Fame don’t matter when you’re thinking about tomorrow
Looking in the mirror; got to hustle up harder
Tie your shoe lace and head to the sky
How are you going to make it, if you don’t even try?

[Chorus]
It’s a new day
Can’t none stop us from shining
No way
Its cause the Click is still grinding
Yeahhhh
Screwed Up Click is here to stay

[Verse 3: Lil’ O]
Aye I am some cat that jumped down over the years
I’m Fat Rat Wit Da Cheese, blood sweat and tears
I putting down for the H, with the rest of my peers
Southside, Screwed Up, y’all know what the deal
And I’m still hustling, still striving, still homping, still grinding
So don’t be surprise when you see O shining
But it’s more than the money, hoes, and the diamonds
It means even through the struggle, you’re going to stay climbing
And mash on anything in front of you
And pay back the haters for what they’ve done to you
It’s real in the field, so I pack a gun or two
And pray to the lord that they don’t take me under, foo
But I got angels, like Screwyou, Mafio, and Lil Gator
Fat Pat up in heaven, I can see them wearing halos
Watching over me, we gone get this pay roll
Believe it, nigga lets it
