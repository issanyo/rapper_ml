Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, bou-bounce
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, I know I know I know
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, bou-bounce
Uh-uh-uh, I got these broads saying..

[Hook: Carmen Sandiego]
Mama I know I messed up, I fell in love with a gangsta
You know what, well I don't care cause he's so gangsta
And I love him and I need him, cause he's so gangsta
(I know), he's so gangsta

[Lil' O]
I'm the boy, your mammy speak about
When she go to work, the one that you sneak in the house
The thug that always beat it up, and have it leaking out
Now it seems, like my dick is all you think about
A bad boy, I'm the playa who rocks glisten
I'm the hustler with the work, boo I got chickens
Street power, I could make these punks stop living
I'm like a man with no legs, boo I'm not tripping
I'm the one your grandmama, say is so sheisty
You be like grandma I know, but he's so icey
And everythang that he roll on, are chrome Nikes
You be like girlfriend, I hope Lil' O like me
I got these broads saying

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
First things first, boo I'm not your pal
And I ain't trying to handcuff you, I got a gal
But I still got you on lock, like you on Rikey's Isle
You said it ain't because my do', its cause you like my style
The way I do it, but if you think I trick stop and listen
Fat Rat wouldn't buy you, a pot to piss in
The only thing that I'm good for, is lots of sticking
Face down ass up, hop in position
Cause baby I'm about to do the fool on you, and make that monkey hang
Have you walking funny, and saying you feeling strange
I just popped a X, and drank some Ginseng
Your bed went squeak-squeak, headboard went bang-bang

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
Well ay-yo, alright
Lil' mama, we fucking all night
Ay-yo, alright
Lil' mama, we fucking all night
Now all that when we getting married, shit baby stop bugging
When you ready hit me up, I'll be on the block thugging
I'll pick you up in that drop top, on buttons
And oh yeah lil' mama, bring your hot cousin
And stop that fussing lil' mama, it's no need
Two's iight, but what's wrong with three
We can all party then fuck, it's on me
From the room to the chronic, to bottles of Don P what

[Hook - 2x]
