[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)

[Verse 1: Lil' O]
Four in the mornin and I'm chillin with my late night hype
I just hit but she ain't my type
She just another big bootie, nice tits, and a face that's right
That stay fly in some name brand tights
This gold digga dont love me, she wouldn't there when I was broke
If I fell shed disappear like smoke
I always ask why I even play myself messin round with these jokes
I gotta throwed lil mamma at home, I'm such a fool
And if you seen my gal playa you would know that I'm blessed
With a pretty face and beautiful breasts
Flat stomach, big bootie, bow legged thighs, runnin track legs
And stay fly from her toes to her hair
Plus I know that she loves me, been with me through thick and thin
When I was broke before I got me some ends
Through all my in and out of jail, court cases, she a nigga best friend
But I always break her heart in the end, I need to chill cause...

[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)

[Verse 2: Lil' O]
If I tell her jump she ain't gon trip and ask why...
She gon say anything for my king, how high?
I swear I can't recall her ever tellin me a lie
Plus she always tell me baby, know I'm down til I die
My gift from the sky, boo I swear I can't believe it
Through all our years together boo I know I never cheated
When I didn't have a penny, got me everything I needed
She got her own dough, college courses completed
The Bible I read it, cause she keep me up in church
The type of girl that keep you out of trouble, out of dirt
Why you with me, I'm a thug and a flurt
Im always in these streets runnin round chasin skirts
But I think I'm growin up now knowing that I played myself
Cause when I cheat on you I hate myself, say to myself
If you did it to me...how would I feel
I think its time to be a man and keep it real, for real cause....

[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)

[Verse 3: Lil' O]
You gon get alot of ice, alot cars, alot of luxury
Cause you didn't have to fuck with me
Even though I was three time felon you still stuck with me
And when I tripped you put up with me
So I'm thinking thats its time I paid you back for what you did
Im thinkin that its time I made you wife and gave you kids
Im thinkin I should put you in a house on a hill
And I know I ain't a trick cause you deserve it cause you real
And baby I'ma treat you like a queen, wine and dine on marble floors
Keep you in the mall so you can shine on these hoes
Take you round the world, one day China, one day Rome
Be a better man so we can have a happy home
Beautiful, brown skin, straight pearl white teeth
Body smooth and soft smellin so sweet
Every time ya walk by in ya g-string ya put me in heat
You and some kids make my vision complete and thats for real cause...

[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
