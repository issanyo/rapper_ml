[Verse 1: Mula O]
All these social networks, like snapchat
Hold up your camera, yelling gang up in the back [?]
Posting pictures of that shit up on your snapchat
Bitches lien, emoji crying on your snapchat
Hope Gwap O beat the case, and let my brother home
Niggas ain't fuckin wit us, I put it on my soul
Fuck the opps, ain't out here, niggas duckin poles
Fuck the opps, they snitchin, put it on the O's
Mula O on some shit boy
Bitches thots they doing dicks boy
YK t'd, you ain't on shit boy
Hit Sparky up, he doin hits boy
And im ridin wit my shitbag
Flex and Cali, them O's in it
We on the land we gettin busy
Tell these thot bitches keep from near me
I keep some bread, bitch i keep plenty
Sippin lean wit the team keep us dizzy
Block bussin, gang poppin out
Hitting stains bitch it's a drought
12 come, gang bailing out
Cuz we ain fuckin wit the cops
Wit a thot, im calling shots
Do bro, do bro, do squad
Bitch stop acting like you not
We in the trap, you use to that, bitch pick a spot
And we heading to the top
Getting money, fuckin hoes, bending blocks
For Star we on the block
I said for Star we sending shots
And free my boys out the box
Stain gang, fuck all the cops
Catch me rolling swisher sweets
Never wife a bitch, can't get with me

Sliding through with Shitbags, tryna catch a opp
Put they steady runnin, we ain't chasin them
Running to that money, steady chasin m's
Niggas really fake, niggas ain't your friend

He went to sleep right up in the street
If its war, it can be beef
