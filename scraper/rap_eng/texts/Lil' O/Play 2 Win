Whoa yeah, block bleeder music nigga
S.U.C. nigga, Straight Wreckin part 2 nigga
Fat Rat with Da Cheeze, hey

[Lil' O]
Now I'm riding on the Interstate, rolling with some heavyweight
On my way out of town, dog it's time to get this cake
H-Town hustler, so you know I'm gonna regulate
Southwest till I die, nigga let's get it straight
Head back to the city, bought the big wide Benz
And a old school Lac, with the big wide lens
Lil' O's a hustler, why lie I sin
So if I ever catch a case, I won't cry from the Penn
Do all my time, I won't snitch on my men
Read a couple books, and pimp my pen
Do a lot a push-up's, write a couple friends
Commesary fool, man I got a couple ends
Fresh out of lock, and I'm right back grinding
Six weeks later, man I'm right back shining
Tricked out the Lac, with the ostrich lining
Couple niggas hate him, but all them bitches mine'n
Send me off of 6-10, Papa Deauxx dining
Lil' O's a playa, ask them hoes that co-signing
Fresh off of summer, this is great perfect timing
Pull out on 4's, so glassy they blinding

[Hook]
I got coke, I got drank
Nigga try to jack me, he gon stank
I'm a hogg, bitch my wrist froze
And I'm addicted to money cars and clothes, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch

[Mike D]
To be honest, I ain't never seen these rappers in the streets
They talk a good game, but they actors to me
This is for my niggas, still stuck up in the gutter mayn
Copping half a zip's out there, trying to bubble mayn
Y'all tell these industry niggas, I mean trouble mayn
Me plus Duke gutter, only for double mayn
And I'ma stand a man up, for the three
Pull the skirts up on these niggas, let the world take a peak
Uh-huh, that shit look like pussy to me
Nigga this C.F.E., Boss Hogg Mike D
And I will not lose, I gotta win
Play it like a boss, that's the position I'm in
Never hear me on these beats, out here acting my life
Like half these boys out here, rapping my life
Don't act like y'all don't know, rap is my second hustle
Imagine if I made this shit, my full hustle
Half these niggas rhyme, they careers straight suffer
This real shit I spit, you just can't get enough-a
Keep em geeking and tweaking, like they on that butter
Corleon Boss Hogg, I'm a bad mo'fucker

[Hook]
I smoke, I drank
Keep a pound of purple, and by the pint
I'm a hogg, riding in a dog
Smoking on a sweet, when the top on fall bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I play to win bitch
Yeah-yeah, I gotta win bitch
Yeah-yeah, we play to win bitch
