(feat. Big Moe, Hawk, Mr.3-2)

[Chorus x2: Big Moe]
Hey heeeeeyyy take it from a pro take it from a proooo
Thug niggas never sweat these hoes cause playas always get chose
We ain't got trick cause yall a know the deal so here playa take it from
A pro

[Mr.3-2]
Now player never sweat these hoes
Spittin game at them while i'm riding on vouges
Had to kick the does like a broad a talking
Broads love the way this big boss be flossing
Now see 99 I let a hoe be a hoe
They wan't leave me alone keep calling my prime co
See I like her and she see the drop
Just cause your baby daddy on lock
My game don't stop some of these broads be scraping
Running around saying she pregnant with my baby
Wanting to be my lady put her pack in my mercedes
For the year two tripple O mann these bopper can't fade me
And lately I been knocking them out by the dozen
Her her sister and her fine lil cousin
All in the same peep these broads are freaks
Better keep a condom on and leave these broads in the street

[Chorus x2: Big Moe]
[Lil' O]
I don't trick to hoes it's Big Dick to hoes
Face down ass up with their kits exposed
Bust a nut wash my dick grab my shit then go
Then I tell them let the mother suckers get your clothes
Then I slide out the doe cause i'm raw like that
Scratch out in the lex cause I ball like that
But I ain't trippin cause I know the way I talk my back
That she can't wait for a playa just to call her back
Then I hit the club ballin with a bad attitude
Hoes like who you think you is i'm like bitch who is you
I'm Lil' O 8900 Braeswood boo
And baby all you broads beneath me like you under my shoe
Cause I know the playa rules and bite boppers ankles off with gator Shoes and
Ball till I fall and give all you broads the blues
Da fat rat wit the cheese make me front the public crew you know what We gon
Do

[Chorus x2: Big Moe]
[Big Hawk]
Every thangs looking lovely champaine caviare sipping bubbley
And I can what you hoes thinking of me
Cause the girls the girls the girls they love me want to rub me
But yall ugly they just love a man
Take a second hoodrat and give her eye contact
After all that i'm in the kiddie kat
You knock FAT PAT whole up on all that
Drop the chit chat back back back back
Serve them like a mama give them baby semilac
These hoes just wanna get sexual
With this squad devernaire intellectual
After sexual on their chance to paper
And all my ex bitches yea they got that paper
Paper chaser bad thug heart breaker
Is it me you love or is it my navigator
Perpatrator I don't carry a wallet
After I break a bitch college why cry for knowlege
So you're just another caught up as hoe
Trying to play pro as you got no doe fo shoe

[Chorus: till fade]
