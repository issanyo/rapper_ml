[Intro: Lil O]
I pull out the choppa
DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU

[Verse 1: Yung J]
Yuh, aye
Yung J keep it live, you already know
Keep it so cold, but ain't messin' with snow
Imma move fast, I can't move it slow
Feel like Mayweather, I'm hittin' with blow
If I get caught, I ain't sayin' no names
Feel like James Harden, I got so much range
Catch up to you, I put you in pain
You can't comprehend the thoughts in my brain
Brett can spit like it's the Fourth of July
$chlick gonna kill this hoe, yeah, he know why
You boys be reaching but ain't touching sky
Feel like I'm Jordan, I'm finna go fly
Yuh, we finesse, it's on the regular
I'm feasting on hate, so call me a predator
No one can fight, they ain't competitors
I make the rules, I'm freaking senator
2016, I'm feeling like Trump
We is up next, so call us Lil Pump
You boys are trash, so stay in the drump
Runnin' these checks like I'm Forrest Gump
Runnin' from opps, they on my ass
I am so swaggy, boy, I got the class
My boys be blowing, but ain't on the gas
Tryna get through this bih, I'm tryna pass
Feel like Tay-K, but I don't keep a K
They gonna hate me but what they gon say
Feel like I'm Curry, 'cause I'm in the Bay
Feel like I'm Watson, I'm runnin' the play
Throw all the shade, yo that's a maybe
These hoes be cheating like they is Tom Brady
I need a real one, but they ain't no lady
Shooting my shot like Tracy McGrady

[Verse 2: Lil O]
Lil O in this bitch and you know how I get it
I'm swervin' and sendin' some shots at yo fitted
They ask, am I with it? On top of my business?
Bitch, I'm finessin' and stuntin' and pimpin'
I'm gettin' my money up bands at a time
For the rap game, I'm the answer like I-
Verson, I'm splurgin' and tryna look rich
That's word to Tay-K, Imma empty the clips
Got Booth, got $chlick, you know what go down
Play with us one time, I'm bustin' the rounds
And you act like a clown, bitch, I'm runnin' yo pockets
Knockin' yo muh fuckin' eyes out the sockets
Got range when I shoot like I play for the Rockets
And handle the whip like a muh' fuckin' jockey
So best not act cocky, best keep yo ass walkin'
'Cause if you act hard, it's a Tec that I'm cockin'
I keep my mouth shut, 'cause my guns do the talkin'
And they just might shut yo ass down like they Rodman
I step to the mic and I get that shit poppin'
The illest alive, and I came for the profit

[Transition: Yung J]
Came for the profit? Yuh, aye, yuh
Second verse, let's get it boy
What? Yuh

[Verse 3: Yung J]
Super Deluxe on this beat, I'm so hot
Look at your girl and she know she a thot
Look at me cookin', I'm stirrin' the pot
Chasin' you down like I am a cop
I go and ball, 'cause I am a beast
Look at me eatin' up, this is a feast
I went to greatest when I was the least
Ballin' so hard like I'm from the East
Me and my boys, we go take your life
Feel like I'm Savage, 'cause I got the knife
Feel like LeBron, I'm juiced up on Sprite
We got the sticks, so we don't go fight
Krispy Kreme, yeah, I stay clean
Feelin' so high, but no green
Stackin' my bands, I'm a feen
ZMill, he sippin' on lean, yuh
Suicide Doors like I slit my wrist
My boy Brett, he got the ice on his fist
Wanna talk smack, your name on the list
I am so crispy like I'm in the mist
This gonna blow up the day that it drops
This'll be fire, we run from the cops
We'll keep it clean, we using the mops
I go and flip it like I got the flops
Super Deluxe, we keep it on low
This is a banger, 'cause I got Lil O
Look at us sip, 'cause we go and po'
Me and Brett, yeah we want mo'
Sucking me off every day of the month
She wanna get it, but she just get one
Look at his ring, yeah he 'ready won
This is so serious, none of it fun
I put them down like I am a vet
Placing your money on me, that's a bet
He tryna hit me, I call that a tech
Hittin' 100, I might have a wreck
Yeah, you know I keep it real
Feel like I'm Gelo, I steal
I don't care how you boys feel
Eatin' it up every meal
Me and Brett, we ran this beat
Look at the bands on my feet
I got more trick than the treat
She wanna get me, she meet
Countin' on me, drop the ball
Brett got the moves and they fall
See me with your girl at the mall
Next time just give me a call, yuh

[Outro: Yung J]
Ayo, you know who this was
Yuh
