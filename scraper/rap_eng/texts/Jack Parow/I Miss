I miss two tone clothes from Andre Carl
I miss fokken early monday morning skoolsaal
I miss the parties when my parents where gone
I miss the days when the booze was still strong
I miss those hip high fullsuite bikinis
I miss Mickey Mouse shirts and polkadot minis
I miss the original Indiana Jones merch
I miss the duck from fokken Telefun Quiz
I miss early morning kaalvoet rugby
I miss KFC when it was still called Kentucky
I miss the days when I thought all the movies were real
I miss my ouma sitting reading Danielle Steel
I miss the first childs play and Jurassic Park
I miss Jake the Snake, Gold Dust and Owen Heart
I miss it and Freddy and Jason Volies
I miss sneaking down the to TV and watching late night movies

Bad old pussycat
Whole day long
By the power of greyskull
Ghost busters

I miss the students seats at Newlands Rugby Park
I miss sleeping with the lights on because I'm scared of the dark
I miss Leon Schuster when he was still taking the piss
I miss screaming Province with my hand in a fist
I miss doing cut and paste projects for school
I miss pollyotters and having braais by the pool
I miss Dinoryders, Bravestar and Bionic Six

I miss Cheers, Arende, Who's the Boss and Wings
I miss puzzles with mom and playing with play dough
Tell me "where in the world is Carmen Sandiego"
I miss giving girls lifts home on my poegie
I miss the days in Marc's car of just smoking and cruising
I miss the A Team and Murder She Wrote
I miss the days when I was still kak scared to smoke
I miss the days when special effects were hand made
When Francios Pienaar still played rugby and didn't eat Lays

There's so much I miss from the old days
There's so much that I learnt from the old ways
Another kid fokken raised by the 80?s
Kytie, Kytie, jy was nie net 'n mytie
I was raised by girls in outfits and kop doeke
Kaal bolyf, kla oortyd en kaal fokken voete
Dallas, Dynasty en Agter elke man
Kringe innie bos en Ballade vir n enkeling
Voortrekker camps and CSV kampe
Mufasa, Aladin, Bambi and Thumper
Klei lat, Swart Kat and self-built tree houses
No shoes, no worries, play holes in my trousers
There's a lot of good things that happened back then
But I can't keep going on about way back when
So that's enough of that, no way no how..
Cause I'll miss all the shit that im doing right now
