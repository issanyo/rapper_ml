[Verse 1]
I grew up never being that fucking cool
I grew up fucking being bullied at school
I grew up always being shit out of luck
I grew up tied up, trying to get unstuck
I was a fucking nerd fucking most of my life
Playing tv games alone at home every night
Too many pimples, too overweight
No cute dimples nose not quite straight
Small fucking house in the wrong side of town
Never ever up, mostly fucking down
No fancy labels, no nice swimming pool
No mom in a beamer to pick me up from school
Took all the punches but never got the girl
Only cash and carry lunches and allergy pills
The boy with the middle path middle class life
The boy on the edge of a sharp fucking knife

Ha ha ha ha ha, who's got the last laugh?
Ha ha ha ha ha, move like a giraffe
Ha ha ha ha ha, this is for the losers
Ha ha ha ha ha, fuck all the cool kids

[Verse 2]
Girls never really gave two fucking looks
I never really looked like those ous in the books
More horatio kane than brad fucking pitt
Less pat lambie a little more johnny smit
Everyone had nikes, I had no name skoene
Everyone had bikes, I drove a fucking scooter
I had peanut butter, no fucking Nutella
My first fucking car was a peach Ford Sierra
Peroxide in my hair, it came out yellow
Everyone had CÃ´te d'Or I had marshmallows
I was always picked last at physical ed
I once got held down and fed stale bread
Life of embarrassment, torment and dread
By the end of high school I was half fucking dead
Stayed away from cool kids made friends with my parents
Spent every night writing lyrics instead

[Verse 3]
So luckily I grew up, threw up, and forgot
Listened to Wu tang, Easy-E and big Snoop Dog
Everything slowly got less confusing
I found all my friends in fucking rap music
Slowly but surely I lifted from the ash
Found my inspiration in brandy and hash
So I fucking grew up fucking drew up some raps
Starting wearing a vest and a long fucking cap
Rose to the top, the next fucking level
Left the fucking punches for the bass and the treble
Left the kak for the lekker, the pain for the fun
Now when I go on stage the kinners go blam
No more bullies, no more shame
No more teasing I'm kak fokkin mijn
This is for the poes who beat me up elke dag
Enjoy your fucking life, parow's got the last lag
