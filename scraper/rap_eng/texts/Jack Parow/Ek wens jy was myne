I look at you and I remember
The way I felt on the day we met
That same old feeling washes over me
It's hard to forget
Nothing has ever changed for me babe
Nothing changes for you
I still want you just as much as I did
When I said, "I do"
I'm still wrapped up in that ring around your finger
Without you, baby, I would be lost
I'm telling you the truth I'm still
As much in love with you as I always was
I'm a slave to your every desire
I worship the ground where you walk
I'm telling you the truth I'm still
As much in love with you as I always was
You still stir up that old desire
I can feel it now as we speak
Nothin' I ever felt before prepared me
For a love this deep
Yeah, I'm still crazy about you, baby
In my heart and in my soul
Yeah, I'm still mesmerized
By two brown eyes and a band of gold
I'm still wrapped up in that ring around your finger
Without you, baby, I would be lost
I'm telling you the truth I'm still
As much in love with you as I always was
I'm a slave to your every desire
I worship the ground where you walk
I'm telling you the truth I'm still
As much in love with you as I always was
Oh, I'm telling you the truth I'm still
As much in love with you as I always was
Always was, always was
As I always will
