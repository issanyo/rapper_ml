This is an ode to you, hate your job but the house needs food
You wanna quit, you wanna kill but the rent is due
Push on through, hold on tight, fight the fight
There's a hand on your throat and it's holding tight

9 to 5, jy try, jy druk, jy hou styf vas
But you work for a boss and you hate his guts
Jy voel stuck, maar onthou, ek's hier vir jou

Whether jy numbers punch of jy huise bou
Yster klou, days too long, nights too short
You just went to sleep, then you're back at work
If you're up at night or you're up at dawn

Whether you're sweeping streets or you're mowing lawns
Whether jy meetings het of jy parties hou
Whether jy suits aantrek of jy klere vou
Whether you're washing cars or washing clothes

This is an ode to all the working class heroes

Bambe-zela, zela
Bambe-zela, ohhhhohhh

I Stand with you
As jy luister na jou baas wat skel
When you on the highway
In a traffic cell
When you on the long road
When the sun comes up
When you down in the dirt trying to get back up
You one of us
Die mense wat die wiel laat draai
Were on the ground while you waiting for your paint to dry
Be-great the vibe
Fresh cut grass smell
With the mechanics
That makes your car run well
Ons is die land de mise
Were in the roughen sea
You wanna run man come run with me
So if you in the que for your groceries half your life
And you think that pedicures are a waste of time
You knock of work
And go to the closest bar
And the only polo you know
Is a type of car
Your one of us
The light at the end of the road
An Ode to all the working class heroes

Bambe-zela, zela
Bambe-zela, ohhhhohhh

You on the long road trying to get back home
Or you feel stuck where you are
And your all alone
You trynna run
But your feet won’t move
You trynna break free
But you can’t get loose
You work your fingers to the bone
But no recognition
So kom kry my by die naaste bar
WIES IN


Bambe-zela, zela
Bambe-zela, ohhhhohhh
