[Intro: Jack Parow]
Fok Fokkity Fok (x4)

[Verse 1: Jack Parow]
Yo, I'm like "hello, honey, I shrunk the kids
I got you tripping on my shit like I’m esctacy
Kom sit maar hier, Baby got an extra seat
I don’t pay for a thing want di’s als verniet
Klap die malste beat, Control-Alt-Delete
I want the house next to ?[] and Hold ek’s hier
Vang ‘n pis on yo' Lamborghini
Harry Hudini, everyone want’s to fuckin' be me
Beam me up Scotty, [?]
[?]
Biscotti, Rizotti, Amanzim-fuckin'-toti
It’s Helmut fucking Lotti
[?], if you don't like this shit, then suck it
If life gives you lemons, cut a whole in it and fuck it

[Hook: Jack Parow] (x2)
Fok fokkity fok, fok fokkity fok
Oh no, you just fucked with the monsters
Fuck your bitch 'til she's fucking unconscience

[Verse 2: Dirt Nasty]
Okay, fok fokkity fock
I'm in the tub with the rubbery duck
With the slut getting suckkity sucked
Chicken heads go cluckkity cluck
Drive a truck from L.A. to Africa
Me and Jack Parow with some crazy bachelor
Your girl hairy like a tarantula
Disappear, fucking abra-cada-brah
We the best ever, red leather
Fuckkity fuck you in the Porsche Carrera
It get better, pussy get wetter
Cause I fucking sniff Viagra forever
Don't matter if you skinny or fat
I fuck your mom right in front of your dad
Hey kids, don't be mad
Cause my dick longer than Jack Parow's hat

[Hook: Dirt Nasty] (x2)
Fok fokkitty fok, fok fokkitty fok
Oh no, you just fucked with the monsters
Fuck your bitch 'til she's fucking unconscious
