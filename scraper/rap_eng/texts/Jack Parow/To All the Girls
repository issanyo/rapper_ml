To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

Yo Dirt is from oakland
Jack is from Africa
Two white rappers
Spectacular
Yo Dirt is jy lus vir n bietjie aksie
Did you just call my mom a motherfucking Nazi
No it means are you ready for some fucking action
Let's go fuck these hoes at a party in a mansion
Yo Dirt I can't think of anything better
How do you say fucking awesome
Leka
En dis hoe ons roll in Afrika where I'm from
I wanna come visit you there
Bring a gun
Ek wil fokken poes lek met my tong
Where'd you learn to speak afrikaans
From your mom

[Chorus]
To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

[Verse2 ]
Now it's your chommie from South Africa, Donkey Kong
Piel fokken thick and veiny like n monkey's arm
Dit lyk of daar n ham uit hang by jou yskas
Hang lang tand rond en wag weer vir my vleis kas
Sys vas en pappa parow kruip rond in die donker
Laat jou bed skud soos n paar hout klompe
So while you at home watching hulu flieks
I'm fucking your bitch with this fucking zulu dick

[Dirt Nast]
I'm a ice cold crispy and I do what I please
My dick goes past my knees
I'm a ice cold crispy and I do what I like
You can take this dick and take a hike
Choo choo train come around the bend
Look you in the eyes while I fuck your friend
Ala ka zu, ala kazaam
It's getting creepy in the back of my van

[Chorus]
To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

[Jack Parow]
Ooh die woes broes coming through to make your poes bend
Your goose slip on the semen like she was on a juice cleanse
Tying up a loose ends with gadgets like McGyver
Arive drive slowly slip sliding up inside her
Orait ne, my rooi lippe soos n fokken [?]
Sy's deurmekaar maar hopenlik suig sy goeie lollipop
As jy lus is vir moeilikheid kan jy sam met ons kom hang
Want Jack Parow Dirt Nast maak jou fokken kniee lam

[Dirt Nast]
I put a popsicle right where it ought to go
In a automobile parked where it [?] go
Beep beep, I'm knee deep in sheep [?]
She a ba-a-ad girl she sneaky
They always said [?] with the stick
Now I'm all grown up beating off with my dick
My sex therapist told me that I'm sick
I said I hope there's no cure, coz I'm loving the shit

[Chorus]
To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before

To all the girls we fucked before
As soon as I cum, It's time to go
Hell no, we don't love them hoes
To all the girls we fucked before
