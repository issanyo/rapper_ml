[Intro: Young Dolph]
Honorable Court
Hey, who is that?
Who is that right there?
Hey, what's up lil mama?

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but she bad so I'm confused (Damn)
Fuck it, I'ma shoot my shot, got nothin' to lose (Fuck it)
I said, "What's up? My name is D" (What up?)
She said, "Nigga, you lyin', yo' name Dolph" (Damn)
Okay, you know me? Then let's go pull off (Let's go)
Jump in this coupe and let's go and get lost (Skrrt)
Took you to my hood (Yeah)
But you was scared (Yeah)
I started laughin' (Yeah)
Then you got mad (Hahaha)
Bet you never been with a nigga like me
Don't give a fuck about bitches, count skrilla like me
We started off havin' fun though (For real)
You asked me where I keep my gun though (On me)
Uh, I don't wanna talk about that
Why that ass so fat ,and why you walk like that? (Ayy)
I'm just a lil nigga out here havin' it
All of my niggas, they savages (Yeah)
Guess what I did last weekend?
Bitch, I made your boyfriend's salary

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
She kept it so real, I can't say no (Nah)
Bitch real thick like clay though (Shit, bruh)
I got Hi-Tec in my faygo (Raw)
Heard you got strippers on payroll (What?)
Nigga I got killers on payroll
My lil mama mad at me
Said that she don't like the way that I'm livin' (Damn, man)
She hate to see cough medicine
Say she don't like the way that I'm sippin' (Shit, man)
I was drinkin' this shit 10 years before I met you
Lil mama, you trippin' (Po' up)
Wait a minute, hold up, it's me (Hold up)
Wait a minute, roll up the weed (Hold up)
Wait a minute, roll up my sleeves, uh
Got a pocket full of blue cheese, ayy
Kickin' shit in the trap like Bruce Lee (Woo)
When I walk in they be like, "Who's he?" (Stylin')
When I walk out they be like, "What the fuck?" (The fuck?)
What the fuck is that lil nigga drivin'? (Haha)
All my niggas, they ridin' (They ridin')
All of these bitches be lyin' (They lyin')
Lil fly nigga plus my bitch fly so together we flying

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Lil mama in a Bentley back (Yup)
Pussy nigga hatin', pulled up beside me (Ayy)
She pulled out a purse, rolled the window down
Told the pussy nigga bust a move, ain't shit to try
Stayed down for a nigga on a gun charge (Yup)
Went to jail with a nigga on a dope case (Damn)
I told the girl how much I love ya, I'd die for ya
Wouldn't think twice, told me, "Boy, go pull weight"
And when I told her ballin' on these hoes, ain't shit to do
10 million dollars on the crib, all that for you
When you ain't even got to ask me where I'm puttin' my dick
'Cause odds are you gon' be with me when I'm getting seduced
You know, penthouses full of your WCW's
And St. Regis, Four Seasons, Londons, and W's
And Rolls-Royces, Benzes, i.e. BMWs
Spend that cake if I'm in love with you, hey
Hey you gon' find it hard to get
Someone goin' hard at TIP
But look where we started at
Closer where we are, and you a part of that
And apologies if you gave me your heart
And I turned around, gave you a heart attack
God damn, I'm a dog for that
Breakin' up? Came too far for that
I keep it real though

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
She kept it so real, I fuck with her forever
She kept it so real that I love her forever
Fuck with her forever, fuck with her forever
