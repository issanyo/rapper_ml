[Intro]
Izze the producer
Yeah
Heh, hey
Already know it
I make this shit look good, don't I?
I make this shit look easy, don't I?

[Chorus]
All I want to be was a trap nigga
Ain't got my ID but I got them racks, nigga
She said he ain't nothin' like these rap niggas
I let her count a million, no cap, nigga
Pull up with yo bitch head in my lap, nigga
Skeeted in her face, made her my baby sitter
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Fuck a job, I went and got me a sack, nigga

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on me doin' jumping jacks, nigga
Bet fifty thousand playin' black jack, nigga
Theater room with Tre-Tre watchin' Rugrats, nigga
He grabbed his Nerf gun and screamed "blatt, blatt," nigga
I couldn't have a boss, so I didn't get a job
I'd rather skip school, hit the block and hustle hard
Most these niggas frauds, all they do is flodge
I heard that you can't go to your hood 'cause you got bought
Took two-hundred and bought some more motherfuckin' diamonds
I put my lil bitch in all that motherfuckin' designer
[?] when I ain't tryin' her, back seat with recliner
That pussy so good I put my starting five line-up

[Chorus]
All I want to be was a trap nigga
Ain't got my ID but I got them racks, nigga
She said he ain't nothin' like these rap niggas
I let her count a million, no cap, nigga
Pull up with yo bitch head in my lap, nigga
Skeeted in her face, made her my baby sitter
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Fuck a job, I went and got me a sack, nigga

[Verse 2]
All she ever wanted, all she ever wanted
All she ever wanted was a nigga like me
Didn't go to college but I'm on your TV
Why I laugh so much? 'cause I make six figures a week
She suck me so good that she got my knees weak
Infatuated with money, I can't go to sleep
Ridin' in a coupe smokin' out an ounce of weed
Here babe, put this in your crack, I think that's the police
In my passenger seat, bad bitch from Greece
But I can't understand a damn thing when she speaks
I need a new trap house, so if you really love me
Like you say you do, I need you to sign your name on this lease

[Chorus]
All I want to be was a trap nigga
Ain't got my ID but I got them racks, nigga
She said he ain't nothin' like these rap niggas
I let her count a million, no cap, nigga
Pull up with yo bitch head in my lap, nigga
Skeeted in her face, made her my baby sitter
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Fuck a job, I went and got me a sack, nigga
