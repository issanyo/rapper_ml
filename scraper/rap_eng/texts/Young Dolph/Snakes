[Hook: Jay Fizzle]
I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake
I can’t trust none of these niggas I stay strapped everyday
I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake
I can’t trust none of these niggas I stay strapped everyday

[Verse 1: Jay Fizzle]
I was  strapped up with that thirty cause these niggas some pussies
I was brought up with some a strap so I didn’t never get bullied
If a nigga try J fizzle he got catch one of these bullets
Everybody wanna rock gang bang or slang on they corner
Theres some B’s on these streets so don’t get caught up on the corner
I keep one off in the head when I when I post in the corner
Ain’t no telling who snitching ain't no telling who want ya
Wide open all times ill be damned to get caught lacking
She like when rest I go to sleep with that package
Sawed off in my jacket, graduated from jackin’
You ain’t really bout that action so you can stop that actin
No I don’t fuck with you niggas I dont like fuck niggas
Stay the fuck from round me i give a fuck about you nigga
Make me touch one of you niggas, you a sucker ass nigga
These niggas getting faker, i guess I’m getting realer

[Hook]
I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake

I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I stay strapped everyday, strapped with that K
Got a balling habit so I stray strapped up with that cake
Saw my old bitch she asked how I was doing
Got 4 cali plugs fuck the rap game I’m forever straight
Gotta lotta bread on my plate, got extra bread in a safe
Bosses and shooters, shooters and bosses
I think I’m Frank Lucas shipping Ps in coffins
I’m so street that I just poured a four in my coffee
I feel like I’m the realest nigga walking
Ain’t nothing but scaled and sandwich bags in here and this my office

[Hook]
I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake
I can’t trust none of these niggas I stay strapped everyday
I still keep one in the head cause these niggas some snakes
They wanna live the life you live they wanna be in your place
Watch yo back up in these streets most these niggas is fake
I can’t trust none of these niggas I stay strapped everyday

[Jay Fizzle]
Can’t trust all of these niggas cause the police they be lookin
Fizzle got extensions and bino got cushions
Bad attitude please don’t push it
300 soliders with me cripping like ?
Don’t think you shootin’ be a real nigga
You fake as yo chain i put yo face on some steal nigga
I ain't signing no deal I want all my money
You can’t play me like a bitch and can’t take nothing from me
