[Intro]
Shit crazy
It's a fucked up world we living in, in today's society man
The life that we don't know
I gotta keep the heater with me right through this cold world man
Ey they don't give a fuck about us man

[Hook]
Gotta keep my heater with me
This a cold world (x3)
I just had a lil' boy feel like I owe him the world
I owe him the world (x3)
Gotta keep my heater with me
In this cold world (x3)
How the fuck we suppos'd  to survive in this cold world
In this cold world (x2)

[Verse 1]
I just had my first born, my lil' boy
That's my pride and joy, the only thing I live for
No second guess, no hesitation I'd kill for
Begin preparing all o' my life, he who I did for
Chasing these meals for (I owe him the world)
I just hate how I had to bring him into this fucked up ass world
The police back killing black kids like its the 1950's
They getting away with murders, mane that shit crazy
All the victims black, but they sayin' it ain't racist
The other day a police pulled this gun out in my face
I wish I could have hit him with the .40 cal on my waist
But if you kill one of them bitches, you get locked away
Damn

[Hook]
Gotta keep my heater with me
This a cold world (x3)
I just had a lil' boy feel like I owe him the world
I owe him the world (x3)
Gotta keep my heater with me
In this cold world (x3)
How the fuck we suppos'd  to survive in this cold world
In this cold world (x2)

[Verse 2]
Late night full of that drank
I see some lights behind me (what the fuck?)
I hit the gas now I'm doing 'bout 90 (Skkkrt)
I hit that bitch I'm getting on doing about 140
Pull up on the side of me nigga I'm busting the .40
Don't give a fuck who it be (x2)
My lil' boy at home waiting on me
These niggas out here hating on me
I gotta keep that thang with me
It's a cold world
Watch yo home boy and watch yo girl
Yo homeboy cross you out just to take yo spot
These bitches gonna be bitches, you know what that's all about
Bow my head
Say a prayer, say amen
Grab my gun
Take you out 'fore I let you take me away from my son

[Hook]
Gotta keep my heater with me
This a cold world (x3)
I just had a lil' boy feel like I owe him the world
I owe him the world (x3)
Gotta keep my heater with me
In this cold world (x3)
How the fuck we suppos'd  to survive in this cold world
In this cold world (x2)
