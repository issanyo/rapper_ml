[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Guess what she just did bruh
Call me talking shit bruh
Call me 30 times back to back but I didn't pick it up
But that ass so fat, when you hit you gotta lift it up
She fell in love with a street nigga now I can't get rid of her
She steady driving by the spot
I ain't answer her phone so she had the nerve to call me cause I de blocked her
She send me the red mad emoji boy bruh I think I got her hot
She blowing my phone up pitiful, she constantly texting me pictures
I had to break it down to her, gonna tell her girl I just wanted to hit you
She said I got her fucked up, I said what the fuck you mean
She said that I owe her, owe you what, what you want some weed?
I got time I'm sorry that I lied for it
That ass so fat she make an RnB nigga cry for it

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She just want a trap nigga, turnt up to my trap bitch
Put her on that trap shit now she can't get over it
Took her to the trap house, now lil mama trapped out
I say can we just be friends, nothing more nothing less
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
I put her on that real shit now she just wanna trap nigga

Verse 2:Jucee Froot
I just wanna trap nigga, nigga let me trap with ya
Money getter dope dealer, only foreign car whipper
Only fuck with boss niggas, never take a loss nigga
Niggas jacking on me cause they see I got that ass bigger
Finna call and fuck with em, he know I'm a buzz killer
If he call me on some shit I'm gonna thug with him
Real nigga need a real bitch, always asking me why I'm bitchin'
Just because you put on something different, don't mean that you can fuck with me
Damn Dolph you don't never wanna listen
Somehow always got to attention
But if you get another mention, you and that bitch there gon' get it
Damn baby, you know you my ringtone
A plus is my theme song, that's why I can never ever leave the trap nigga alone

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She just want a trap nigga, turnt up to my trap bitch

I say can we just be friends, nothing more nothing less
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
She just want a trap nigga, she just want a trap nigga
I put her on that real shit now she just wanna trap nigga
