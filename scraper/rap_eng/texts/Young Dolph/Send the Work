[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Told the plug, send that work, we can deal with it
Talkin' pounds and them Keelos
Me and Migos
And we get that [?]
And we get that [?]
Send that work, we can deal with it

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
I get it from the westside
Get it sent to the crib, I got the best eyes
Tryna get that big Meech money
My [?] don't know english, he speak funny
Thank god for the Mexican
Can't wait for Tampo to break out again
More Pablo, money me amigo
Put us in the [?] we get the Rico
These my projects, I [?] know
Niggas tuckin' their jewellery, I'm devo
We got the feds saying who them niggas
Got them haters saying hope police shoot them niggas

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Told the plug, send that work, we can deal with it
Talkin' pounds and them Keelos
Me and Migos
And we get that [?]
And we get that [?]
Send that work, we can deal with it

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I don't want to hit you, bad bitch, all I smoke is Murda
I might send 40 of them to my Uncle, Murda
I stay fresh as fuck, and still sippin' purple
Nothing but bossed up made men in my circle
Na, we don't kick it, we just surve it
Hope he never plan on snitching, cause Imma hurt him
Bust that chopper, have a nigga jumpin' hurtles
Fresh as fuck in the trap, rock with some shit you never heard of
Get it for the low, and sell it for the cheap
I've been trappin' out the motel all week
Sippin' syrup, countin' money, no sleep
Trappin' in my house, 'cause designer hurt my feat
Pull up in that 2-seater, it's just my bitch and me
These niggas say they street, but I don't see them out here
I don't see them nowhere, glocc in my underwear
Look up under that bed, I got work all up under there
It's Dolph

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Send that work, we can deal with it
Told the plug, send that work, we can deal with it
Talkin' pounds and them Keelos
Me and Migos
And we get that [?]
And we get that [?]
Send that work, we can deal with it
