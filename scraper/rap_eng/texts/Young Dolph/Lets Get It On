[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Balling G saying make them bitches lay it down
Smoking weed, bumping Pimp C, pocket full of stone
Sitting in my spot, with a closet full of pounds
Sipping sizzurp mothafuck what you hizzard
You shining shit on my rich, took yo bitch and cost me one bizzard
Shawty just jumped in my car looking like dessert
I [?] my weed, put my hand on her thigh
Put the fuckin car in reverse
I did it, I did it, I did it again
I fucked lil mama real good but this time she brought her friend
Trap house booming like it ain't no tommorow
Countin money like Wells Fargo
The plug call
I feel like Marvin

[Hook]
Lets get it on
That what I told that bitch when she jumped in my passenger seat looking good as fuck
Lets get it on
That what I text my plug when I got down to my last pound, I need it now
Lets get it on
He said you ain't said nothing but a word, I got bout fifth of em laying around
Lets get it on
Lets get it on
Lets get it on

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Pocket full of blue money, new money
Pull up doing 2 something
Three 6, who run it
Foreign whip no roof
I might pull up silent on ya
223 together make over I put a body on it
All about bout a check, old school righteous
All this common sense, that's a whole lot of money
Got that cocaine do pilates
Turn that kitchen to karate class
Sorry your car died, my Maserati [?]
All of these windows on my crib nigga I need me some tint
All of these niggas so broke, my nigga I think they need splints
I'm just still getting that cash
My nigga and smoking a bag
Might set a Guinness world record, my nigga for getting it fast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
I'm just a dope boy with a attitude
The work just came in from Malibou
Nah I don't play bitch no I'm not in the mood
I got money to count and p's to move
Remember I used to sell my weed at school
But now I fuck bitches that teach at school
While she at work I'm selling weed all at her house
With my AKA bitch bent over all on her couch
Phone blow up but I ran out
I done got out to my last ounce
I ain't said shit I'm bout to smoke this
If I ain't got no weed I can't focus
Damn all the lean gone
Damn all the weed gone
Just sent a text to my Connect phone and said

[Hook]
