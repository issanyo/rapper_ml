Break down dimes in the trap house
Bitches face down with they ass out
Got 100k in the stash spot
I will never, I will never
Break down dimes in the trap house
Bitches face down with they ass out
Got 100k in the stash spot
I will never trade, I won’t cash out

[Verse 1 – Skooly]
Look, I was raised around trap house
Try to keep it real in all the shit I rap about
My brother sold yay every day and he had me in the spot with the motherfucking strap out
Nigga can’t fold
I was 16 with a real bankroll
Then they killed my nigga, I still miss my nigga
I do this for me, I do this shit for my team
I do this for Jimmy Dean, nigga fuck you mean
Lost Big Cuz On the hum blug, he had all the drugs
Talking bout drugs, man Big Kev was the plug
So I’m tryna get a million and I got my niggas
Give a fuck about a bitch now stay up out my business
Look, now the youngin pipe, I’m alright
Never fright, not the type
I got stripes straight up out the trenches, yeah

Break down dimes in the trap house

Break down dimes in the trap house
Bitches face down with they ass out
Got 100k in the stash spot
I will never trade, I won’t cash out

[Verse 2 – Young Dolph]
I got 40 stacks in my pocket bitch
Spent a dirty hundred K on a whip
And I would never serve you because I heard you’s a snitch
Trap shit, yeah loose lips sink ships
Got a half a milly at the stash house, can’t nobody go there
But the spot’s in south Memphis, I sell my dope there
And I fucked your ho there
But the spot in LA, I use that for the safe
I use that for the getaway, might have to burn a nigga and get away
They say if you want something did right then you got to do it yourself
That’s why I flew to Cali, front the plug, got the shit back all by myself
Ay I’m just breaking down these 50s at the spizzot
Keep the best shit in the city, that’s why my trap so hizzot

[Hook]
Break down dimes in the trap house
Bitches face down with they ass out

Break down dimes in the trap house
Bitches face down with they ass out
Got 100k in the stash spot
I will never trade, I won’t cash out
