[Hook:]
Everything that I do, know I gotta kill it
If that pussy good bitch you know I gotta kill it
She asked could I get her hair done I said bitch I ain't trippin
Every time I breathe on the beat, nigga you know I gotta kill it
Kill it, kill it
Everything I do I kill it
Got a man that's with yo bitch from the back, nigga you know I killed it
Kill it, kill it
Everything I do I kill it
Chick got a 30 pack of killer, you know I'm bout to kill it

[Verse 1:]
It's Tim motherfuckin Gates, baby
It ain't no secret why these lil niggas hating baby
I'm killin pussy and I ain't caught a case lately
And let em swallow all my kids like I hate babies
Damn, I could have opened up a day care, and stay there
Where I'm from, we never learn how to play fair
Got wisdom like an old man, surprised I ain't got grey hair
While these niggas yeah they lift up
But trust me they just gay faces
I'm a fool, yeah, it's true
I'm guilty and I am that dude
There's so many hoes I can open up my own girl school
Haha, and I'm the dean
The faculty yea I jug that
Say what they want but I bet they tell you I kill that

[Hook:]
Everything that I do, know I gotta kill it

[Verse 2:]
Ak-47, I'm killin erything
Turn the bizz strong to a fuckin empire
15 years old I found out Mary Jane was my secret admirer
If it ain't about money, man I don't feel it
Every time I call your bitch she relapse
I ain't got a 10, we meet up at the hill
She pop a bottle with me then I give her the bizness
Said she a dog girl so I killed it
Killed it then peeled off
Now you got the wrong nigga bruh
Never cookin hard, never sold soft
But I just got a 30 pack of treks bruh
This that good shit so I got it tached bruh
But anyway I'm killin shit, that's the facts brah
I'm from Castello, that's a million dollar track, brah!
