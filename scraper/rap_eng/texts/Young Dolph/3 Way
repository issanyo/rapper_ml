[Hook (x2)]
I can trust none of these bitches they too sneaky
You see me with two cups then you know what I'm drinking
Don't fuck with niggas cause they gossip like some bitches
Get rich or die tryin' I think I'm 50
Just texted my plug I think I need a extra 50
My other plug call I clicked him on 3 way
Ay man your bitch call me when her friend on 3 way
They talkin' about let go, hook up and have a threeway
I po'd the drank to muddy now it got me sleepy
Real nigga so I keep real niggas with me
I ain't trippin' throwin' money in Magic City
Fuck that rap shit nigga I been runnin' my city

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
You don't believe me go and ask the streets of Memphis
My hood full of hustlers sellin' dope or Pimp
70 bands a week and still independent
The coldest nigga out the bitch since Penny Hardaway
Bitch your nigga ain't shit he soft as tissue (pussy)
Don't come over here unless you bring your friend with you
Ain't going in the club if I can't bring in my pistol
You took lil mama to yo crib, you a stupid ass nigga

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Been in a lot of hoods, stuntin' like Baby
Still don't fuck with these niggas cause they slim shady
These bitches ain't loyal heard that from Breezy
On that trap or die shit forreal that's why I fuck with Jeezy
Young nigga with a attitude, that's why I fuck with Eazy
These mad designer I'm rockin', I make it look easy
I can't trust none of these niggas, they gon' tell it
Real friends and fake friends keep them separate
Bad bitches only mediocre, there the way
I met lil mamma yesterday and smashed her yesterday
I don't remember her name but her friend name was Tandria
They call me for the next three days straight
But I didn't answer, fuck them hoes
