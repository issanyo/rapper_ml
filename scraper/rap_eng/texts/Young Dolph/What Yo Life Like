[Intro]
(Zaytoven)
Oh you say you can't do hoops?
Oh you say from where? Oh
Used to do what? Okay
Used to have what?

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I fucked up a couple sacks until I got it right
When your money them bitches beg to spend a night
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I turned into a superstar over night

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
What your life like?
Every day I'm catchin' flights
Every day I pray to God tryna get my life right
The way my bracelet and my watch hittin' I think they wanna fight
I put that bitch on top and let her ride me like a bike
Bitch said that she fucked me? She just lyin' for promotion
I just smoked a blunt, a lemon tree on the ocean
She listenin' to my music, I'm caught up in her emotions
I just spent 50,000 on an iced out emoji
I don't socialize because I'm not really that social
I'm from where you stack them M's up and try not to get noticed
My OGs keep on tellin' me, young nigga just stay focused
Remember I used to pull up with 60 pounds in the Focus

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I fucked up a couple sacks until I got it right
When your money them bitches beg to spend a night
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I turned into a superstar over night

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
7th grade I sold my first nickel sack of reefer
Vogues on the Chevy got it tall as Wiz Khalifa
Back had the work, Chi had a little cheaper
South side with an F, my joggin' suit was FILA
I'm a D-boy, I had the silk shirt and all
Very therapeutic when I step in the mall
Got my Cali plug, one night I went to pin ups
Started doin' kush-ups when your ass was doin' chin-ups
Had the Tec-9, Steph had the Mac-11
Used to charge a nigga 150 for a seven
All the way up, it's 96 for a pound
Made it rain so long I almost made a bitch drown

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I fucked up a couple sacks until I got it right
When your money them bitches beg to spend a night
Tell me what your life like
You sellin' green, sellin' white
You ever seen a dope fiend hit a pipe?
I turned into a superstar over night
