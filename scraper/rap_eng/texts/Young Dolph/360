[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Nigga, what's the business?
Big boy Benzes
Count a half a million in my big boy Bentley
Baller of the century, these other niggas history
Everyday's Christmas, trapping long distance

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Nigga wants the business
Big boy business
Never ask for me and my big boy business
Baller of the century, these other niggas history
Everyday's Christmas, trapping long distance

Put my wrist up and now your girlfriend need assistance
Light bliss and this is hell she's persistant
My looshi never kissed her but my dick's full of her lipstick
Lipstick on my MCs now your girlfriend out the misky
White girls at my party bad tonight limp bizkit
Half a pint of lean, codeine I piss it
Rolled up on me homie, I'm a shoot while risky
Let my watch home 60 so my chopper home 50


[Hook: Gucci Mane]
360 ye
360 ye
Nigga I just bought a Bentley 360
That chopper hit you make you do it 360
I was a broke nigga like 360
360 ye
360 ye
Nigga I just bought a Bentley 360
I was a broke nigga like 360
That chopper hit you make you do it 360
360

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I was fucked up did a 360
My auntie on my money dirty but she say I'm gifted
Passenger seat with a girl with some big titties
I stay clean as fuck but my money filthy
10 grand paint job will get you unlimited blowjobs
I only deal loud no blowjob
But get up off my dick that's your hoe job
Get your ass wacked we'll send your mom a postcard
Flip that passage fuck that whip and then went and did it again
Mama said that she heard that I be dealing again (sorry)
Count money while I flip that loud in the wind
And less than 30 minutes is I can count to 360

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
360 ye
360 ye
Nigga I just bought a Bentley 360
That chopper hit you make you do it 360
I was a broke nigga like 360
360 ye
360 ye
Nigga I just bought a Bentley 360
I was a broke nigga like 360
That chopper hit you make you do it 360
360
