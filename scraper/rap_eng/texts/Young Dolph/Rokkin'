You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Crushed ice, two cups
Shoutout to Texas, I'm still bangin' that screwed up
They call me exclusive AK, ay mr [?]
[?] got the whole city juiced up
I'm on my Uncle Snoop shit, rocking blue chugs
I jump on the instrumental, and leave it bruised up
They say life's a bitch, and it's too short
I ran with my young bitch, call it too short
2 iPhones 3 prepaid
Lil' momma phone last night call in and ask for a replay
Young made nigga, with them billion dollar plans
To make all of my fellows a million dollar made

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
First 2, what they do
These shades [?] me 2 grand
Guess you could say I pay for crystal clear view man
Them young niggas be like 'Dolph you the truth man'
Got your girl a CD, cause she a new fan
Skrilla [?] got a family, not a crewman
501's in a pair of these square
Just left the store and bought three pair
I'm in my own lane, I got my own slang
[?], I drop straight flames
You oughta know by now, you rockin' with one of the [?]
I'mma wait around the [?] point blank period

[Verse 4: Tim Gates]
I need a fire fighter fight me when I get behind the [?]
[?]
You never wanted to be made, it's just that money that I like
My new name is Rod Roddy, only talk when the price is right
Man I swear that I'm a phoon, fuck your wife out of your sheets
And I swear that shit is [?]
I swear I'm so disrespectful, but I can't help it
All I drive is 2-seaters, they say I'm so selfish
Super clinic, call me mister way you get that
Different colour diamonds, [?] mismatch
Heard niggas feelings, but I don't give a fuck
I'll [?] in the woods
I'm all about them bucks
