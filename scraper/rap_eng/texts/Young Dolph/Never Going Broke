[Intro: Ralo]
Uh, you know
I'm the only rapper don't need no show money
You dig what I'm sayin'
Ralo, woo
Famgoon

[Verse 1: Ralo]
The pack in, I'm back in, fuck a backend
A black man running shit like I'm Batman
You can't even get the leprechaun to craft this chain
You rap niggas get behind the bars, I bet they fame
Fuck a bank account, I carry cash in large amounts
These rappers rappin' 'bout them bricks but never sold an ounce
If you meet these niggas you'll see why I treat these niggas
I can't believe I was a kid that wanted to be these niggas

[Chorus: Ralo]
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I can't do it, I can't go, nah never
Goin' broke, sell some dope, sell a ho
Sell whatever to feed my folks
Most these niggas just want these bitches
I just want that bankroll
I might send her through the airport
Put her on my payroll
Real niggas make shit happen, yeah
Fake niggas just be cappin', yeah
The loudest nigga in the room, yeah
The weakest nigga in the room, yeah
He can't wait to tell it, far from a star
I looked Benjamin in the face and said 'til death do us part
Ayy, Rolls Royce on Elvis Presley Boulevard (trappin')
Mama in the next room smokin' hard
It's about where you finish, not where you start
I ain't never going back to this shit man

[Chorus: Ralo]
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke

[Verse 3: Ralo]
If I go back broke again I would sell some dope again
I know some people say I'm the realest and they hope I win
I don't walk inside the club unless we bring them toasters in
I'm sorry if I fucked your ho 'cause I might fuck that ho again
I will never feel another man
Send his ass to the motherland
A hundred shots, ain't shoot shit
Where the fuck all the shootin' went?
Niggas know I don't give a damn
Niggas know I don't give a fuck
If you don't know you better ask about me
Ask about the kid in the bluff
I'm a star food nigga
Richer than all you niggas
I ain't never had to do a song
Twenty-five, ten million strong
Real niggas don't live long
Long live all my brothers
And if I ever have to die with 'em
I'ma die rich motherfucker

[Chorus: Ralo]
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke
I ain't goin' broke
If you ever see me you won't never see me broke
Before I sold a CD you would see me sellin' dope
Don't you look too hard 'cause he might see me with his ho
I ain't goin' broke
