[Verse 1]
Word on the street, that lil nigga ill
Word on the street, that lil nigga for real
You ever counted so much money it gave you the chills?
Ran through a half a mil, we ain't got no record deal
Sold my own dope, rolled up my own smoke
Started getting money and couldn't trust my own folks
She got booty shots or not, shit iono
I fuck my own ho, and prolly yours too nigga
I learned how to weigh up dope when I was goin' to school nigga
That's why I thought that it was cool to sell my dope at school nigga
See me with yo ho, you know what we about to do nigga
On the way to the Marriott bout to act a fool Wit her

[Bridge 1]
On the way to the room gotta phone call
Money on the line had to drop that bitch off
Just like that, I had yo bitch ready to drop them drawers
Money on my phone and me and my niggas we want it all

[Hook]
What have you done for me lately, that's why it's fuck you pay me
Its like this money just be callin' me (2x)
Money On my Phone, Money in my home
Money On my Phone, Money in my home
Money On my Phone, Bitch Leave Alone
Money On my Phone, Money in my home

[Verse 2]
I got mud in these Two Cups(sizzerp), I got money on my iPhone
Shawty from the club ask me to give her a ride home
Got to her crib and then she took a ride on my bone
What have you done for me lately
Yo phone number I misplaced it
You got some good head but i replaced it
You got some good brain, so bitch don't waste it!
If it ain't bout a dolla I don't give a damn bout it
30 P's in the trunk, but my license not valid
Talk about the streets but you not bout it
Every Dolph show is like a dope boy riot

[Bridge 2]
What have you done for me lately, nigga fuck you pay me
I was fucked up until my plug saved me
Nowadays I got mo customers than Macy's

[Hook]
What have you done for me lately, that's why it's fuck you pay me
Its like this money just be callin' me (2x)
Money On my Phone, Money in my home
Money On my Phone, Money in my home
Money On my Phone, Bitch Leave Alone
Money On my Phone, Money in my home
