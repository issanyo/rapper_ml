[Hook: Young Dolph]
Ain't gon' never ever stop pourin' fo's
Ain't gon' never ever stop doggin' these hoes
Told momma we ain't never ever going back broke
Cause I ain't gon' never ever stop sellin' dope
Ain't gon' never ever stop sellin' dope
Told momma we ain't never ever going back broke
Cause I ain't gon' never ever stop sellin' dope

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
That Bentley it need go 'head and drop
I can't wait to cash out on that bitch and park in front of my trap
Trunk full of work, got that 45 in my lap
Nah I don't need no help, ran through 80 pounds by myself
You had a silverspoon nigga, I had it hard
My whole family on hard, that's why I ain't got no heart
The fuck is that nigga I ain't got no feelings
This one here a extra 40, that's why I ain't got no ceiling
I get fresh as fuck, just to go post up in the trap
She call me a 100 times, just to put her face in my lap
My momma gave birth to a million dollar criminal
Balenciaga everything and you know what I'm sippin' on

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I couldn't if I wanna
Boys do what they can, man do what they wanna
All my niggas came up off the corner
Pull up on my street nigga you smell that aroma
Welcome to California
Drankin' pints of codeine back to back like Coronas
My partner killed that sucker but still got shot in the stomach
You lookin' for him, then you lookin' for me
I put that on my momma
Sharonda always hold my sex, so I bought that bitch a honda
Civic Dolph you pitiful
Momma you gave birth to a million dollar criminal
These bitches sound subliminal
Ain't gon' never ever ever ever ever change on me
I be like this until my funeral
