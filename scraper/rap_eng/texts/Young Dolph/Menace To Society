[Intro: Young Dolph]
I can't be nobody but me man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I smoke blunts and rock designer in all my pictures
If I don't like you, it's fuck you and whoever wit' you
I spill hot sauce everywhere I go, I make a mess
Your favorite rapper on my IG learning how to dress
And his bitch on my line talking 'bout she got next
Record labels on my line, say they got a blank check
Waiting on me, I said hold up, wait homie
I ain't nothing like these rappers y'all been out here signing
I came in this bitch ballin' like Pac mixed with the Big Tymers
Don't ask me what I rep, just read these motherfuckin' diamonds
My daddy couldn't give me shit so I give my son the world
He only two and I already tell him don't trust these girls

[Hook: Young Dolph]
If it ain't 'bout no paper put that shit behind me
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society
Pain killers and promethazine, nobody high as me
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society
Posted in the trap somewhere, that's where you can find me
Why you talk about the streets so much? cause that's who signed me
Jumped out of the Rari just like Kane in a white tee
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society

[Verse 2: Jay Fizzle]
Your favorite rapper scared of me, tell him to come out hiding
All this goddamn sauce on me come from inside these diamonds
Big-faced Rollie wrapped 'round my wrist, it got perfect timing
Dope boy table, fake A jump, 500 just to line me
Bitches tryna find me, labels beg to sign me
Fuck the deal, Empire for life until I'm dead
My Glock, some weed, some pills, that's all I need, now where my meds?
Posted at the trap with the draco in my left hand
All through your city in that foreign where you can find me
My [?] man like has been, keep shooters right behind me
I buy a bitch with candy, can't trust no ho, she lying
Keep bullshit way behind, man Lil Fizzle just be shining

[Hook: Young Dolph]
If it ain't 'bout no paper put that shit behind me
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society
Pain killers and promethazine, nobody high as me
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society
Posted in the trap somewhere, that's where you can find me
Why you talk about the streets so much? cause that's who signed me
Jumped out of the Rari just like Kane in a white tee
I feel sorry for your mama, menace to society
