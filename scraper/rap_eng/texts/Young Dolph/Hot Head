[Chorus: Berner]
I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
I threw the padlocks in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
We threw the padlock in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed

[Verse 1: Berner]
They say that I'm a hot head
Pull it out the flat-rate box, this shit is not dead
Smoking out the pound like Snoop, I keep the block fed
Seven mil on my new crib, they ain't got bread
Flexing all that money on the gram, damn
Keep the heater clean so it don't jam
Bought some new land, I'm on my grown man
Cut it all down, freeze a whole plant
Turkey bags full of brand new cuts
They say they smoke tough but they don't smoke like us, yeah
Run some extracts, grab the S-Class
Big Bern checking in, I got the best pack

[Chorus: Berner]
I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
I threw the padlocks in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
We threw the padlock in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Hard head, big heads, blue face, big bread
Hard head make a soft ass
I say fuck that, nigga I need a sack
Smash her from the back, pullin' out her tracks
Smokin' killer shit from a new batch
Told her I fuck with her but don't get too attached
Hiding my red eyes behind these Cartier glasses
Smoking lemonade, dippin' through the traffic
I call my bitch [?], she the baddest
We been known who can live life the fastest
Addicted to drugs and fashion

[Chorus: Berner]
I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
I threw the padlocks in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
We threw the padlock in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed

[Verse 3: Prezi]
Yeah I'm hard-headed, judge had me fighting for my life
I used to get my ass whooped if I ain't beat home them streetlights
Hittin' house licks and sellin' shit for the cheap price
With all the mainy shit I did, surprised I even sleep right
Never needed no approval
Kept a hammer, it was crucial
'Frigerator empty, every night we had Cup O' Noodles
They say they love me but show no love, this shit confusing
I love winning, you niggas stupid you think we losing
You niggas broke, get off your ass, don't make excuses
Ain't met a nigga that's fuckin' with me, that's no disputing
Them people on me, I keep it on me, I still ain't listening
My niggas slimy, these streets be grimy, I still ain't tripping

[Chorus: Berner]
I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
I threw the padlocks in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed, before we had Glocks
We threw the padlock in the sock motherfucker
Yeah I'm hard-headed, I couldn't listen
They'd say I'd end up dead or in prison
'Cause I'm hard-headed
