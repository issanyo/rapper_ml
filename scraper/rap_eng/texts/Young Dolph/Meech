[Intro]
Yeah
Hey man, you seen my phone?
Which one man?
Not that phone the trap phone
Paper route Business bitch

[Hook]
Yeah my bitch she bad
All my niggas rich
I got work for cheap
Damn I feel like Meech
Two-toned wraith
On some big feet
I fucked her to sleep
Then jumped back in the streets
Momma put me out
I'm straight out the trap
Stuffed a 100 in a box and sent it cross the map
I'm geeked up on the lean
Counting while you sleep
Everybody eat
Damn I feel like Meech

[Verse 1]
My car don't got a top
It's money when I talk
Got a beam on my Glock
And I'm drinking Raw
Lil momma so fine I went up in that pussy raw
Then I fucked her friend
She said, you a Dog?
I heard they want me dead so now I'm flexin' even harder!
I pull up in that Ferrari rocking a lot of water
Fucked the other side
It's a homicide
Numbers don't lie
My trap on fire
Everytime you see my I be lit as fuck
In the strip club throwing that shit up
I feel like Shawty Lo
I'm the man
Two-stepping counting paper that's my money dance

[Hook]
Yeah my bitch she bad
All my niggas rich
I got work for cheap
Damn I feel like Meech
Two-toned wraith
On some big feet
I fucked her to sleep
Then jumped back in the streets
Momma put me out
I'm straight out the trap
Stuffed a 100 in a box and sent it cross the map
I'm geeked up on the lean
Counting while you sleep
Everybody eat
Damn I feel like Meech

[Verse 2]
Damn I feel like Meech
I think we BMF
Slamming all these pounds I need a championship belt
Pull up, Pick up, Pull out, Drop out, Top off, It's Dolph!, Cough Syrup, No cough
Yeah I come from a place where they don't make it out
Young Nigga snorting pills ready to take you out
My bitch bad and juicy
I wear Roberto Cavalli every Tuesday
Medicine, what I'm sipping, For real
I got your bitch skinny dipping at the crib
Serving, counting, smoking ounces
I just made a play for 300k


[Hook]
Yeah my bitch she bad
All my niggas rich
I got work for cheap
Damn I feel like Meech
Two-toned wraith
On some big feet
I fucked her to sleep
Then jumped back in the streets
Momma put me out
I'm straight out the trap
Stuffed a 100 in a box and sent it cross the map
I'm geeked up on the lean
Counting while you sleep
Everybody eat
Damn I feel like Meech
