[Hook – Hype Pacino]
Dope boy shit, dope boy shit
Hyping your dope, that’s all that we taught
Dope boy shit
Dope boy shit, dope boy shit
Blocks and them pounds, locking down towns
Dope boy shit
Dope boy shit, dope boy shit
I’m getting this money, you know what it is
Dope boy shit
Dope boy shit, dope boy shit
I’m trapping, I’m trapping, what’s happening?
Dope boy shit

[Verse 1 – Hype Paccino]
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy shit
Nigga this that dope boy shit
Shoutout to my homeboy crew
36 Os, bitch [?] whole brick shit
If we got beef we on top of it
Got bricks in that cheap ass apartment
30 round clips in that Glock boy
Hundred round drums in that chopper
Got your bitch riding with a dope boy
She ain’t never had Gucci out the store boy
Let her splurge on her, look at them curves on her
Later on I’m getting in that dope, boy
Sixteen Os, block don’t close
All day traffic, swaying [?]
Getting to the money, presidential Rolex
Blocks on blocks, knot don’t fold
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy shit
Nigga this that dope boy shit
Out in these streets I sold more bricks
This that real coke boy shit
My trap booming, all day bunking
Y’all dudes losing
Turn up, nigga turn up
My trap going stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Young Dolph]
Dope boy shit, dope boy riot
I can’t deny it, I’m a straight rider
My traphouse on fire
Your trap booming slow cause your prices are higher
And I got it for cheap, my nigga Ice say he got a play for twenty Ps
Just sold 50 Ps of reggie for 50 Gs
Yeen getting money nigga, please
Counting money, smoking like a chimney
A hundred rounds for my enemies
If you’s a pussy, you no friend of me
Been getting money, y’all remember me
I done seen a half a mill, [?] Benjamins
Dope boy shit, you on that broke boy shit
I got a trap nigga scholarship
You don’t owe me no apologies
Keep that shit in oyur pocket G
Go to the strip club, throw about a G
Outfit bout another four Gs
Can you get my number? Ho please
Alright here’s your baby daddy, he the police
I’m on the left coast tryna get some more Ps
In the club, the bag, he opened it up, looked at me and said
Why you keep your money so neat?
