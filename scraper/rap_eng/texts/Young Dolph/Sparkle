Money whores got them sexual (sexy)

Diamonds dancing, whore, strip your pants for me

Baby like the sauce
So I bought a little extra
I don't care what your preferencies is
I got OGs preferencies
Pretty bitches on my resumée
Ménage-à-trois, TresEmmé
Baby blessing with the kissy face
And I didn't even have to pay
My money good is all I have to say
Movie everyday, matinée (Lovele$$)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Nah, I ain't got time to play
Bitch, I spend all my time getting paid
All these racks on me, I might go 'bout [?] day
I just smoked a blunt, [?] tree and [?]
Fell asleep on your bitch, woke up the next morning [?] 8 (8 in the morning)
She said [?] (what)
You do what you want with your wrist (hey)
Don't really got time for a bitch (nah)
[?] photo time on my wrist (ooh)
Trap nigga [?] at the bar with a bad bitch in Ruth Chris
Outside, and the valet got so foreign and ruthless

[Chorus: Lovele$$]
Sparkle, sparkle
Sparkle sparkle sparkle
Sparkle sparkle sparkle
Sparkle sparkle, sparkle sparkle (sparkle)
God bless the money count (sparkle)
For counting my blessings

Sparkle sparkle, sparkle sparkle (sparkle)
God bless the money count (sparkle)
For counting my blessings
Flawless perfection
In the streets I'm a legend
