Stepped up in this bitch, white Marc Jacob's on
Don't know why, but seems like all the real niggas gone

Shout out to Boosie, mother fucker one time
Say I pray for Badass and blow yourself a strong
Man that's fucked up, they trynna do lil' homie rush
Started getting rich, they started hatin', I guess that's how it goes
So rubberbands and extra clips, that's how we roll
