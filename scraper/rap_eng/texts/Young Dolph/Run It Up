Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit complainin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit cryin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up

[Verse 1]
You can't kick it with me if you ain't a hustla
You can't smoke out with me, I heard you a busta
You lie too much so I can't trust ya
You hangin' with some fuck niggas, so It's motherfuck ya, aye
I told my niggas we was gon' get rich together
I told momma "momma we gon' be rich forever"
I can't fuck with a nigga that don't want shit
She get her own money, damn that's my kind of bitch
The plug prices was too high so I crossed the map
He saw me flexin' now he lookin' awful now

[Hook]
Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit complainin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit cryin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up

[Verse 2]
While you was at the house with the bitch cuddled up
I was on the block in the trap running it up
I can't chase a bitch, I'm chasing commas bruh
Real niggas see eye to eye and you not one of us
Real niggas we don't make excuses
They say flipper he ain't too hard, he abusive
When it comes to the trap shit, I just do it
Million dollar play, watch me execute it
I can't sleep for too long, I might miss some
Trap phone start jumpin' bout six some

[Hook]
Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit complainin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit cryin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Quit bitchin' nigga, run it up
Run it up, run it up
