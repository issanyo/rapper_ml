[Intro]
It's Dolph
I Apologize
It's my real life nigga
Life's a mother fucker man

[Verse 1]
19, [?] boomin'
Didn't have to, but you took me in like I was you own
No momma, no daddy, raised by my granny
Used to ask me who my momma, and I would say [?]
You learned me like a son, when I was just a grim baby
I ain't been to church in a while, chasing [?]'s lady
I hate that shit cause I know that ain't how you raised me
Dragged my knees to the floor, and get them all greasy
When I was 12 years old, I started smoking weed
When I was 15, that's when I start running the streets
A little after that I knocked up a couple G's
But at the same time, made you disappointed in me

[Hook]
The worst day of my life, I made my grandma cry
Lord, can you please tell her I apologize
Every time I think about it, I get the water eyes
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry momma, I apologize
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I'm sorry momma, I apologize

[Verse 2]
Lord please, if you can hear me
Can you please tell my grandma I'm sorry for all the trouble
And tell her that I remember everything
That she taught me, and taught me, and I love her
Life's been hard, but in 2008 when you got sick
I swear to God, it got rougher
Remember walking out the hospital, every night
Praying to God, please don't let her suffer
She raised her kids and grandkids, she didn't deserved it
To see the lady who raised you, like they [?]
Blunt after blunt, with the water eyes
For everything, grandma, I apologize

[Hook]
The worst day of my life, I made my grandma cry
Lord, can you please tell her I apologize
Every time I think about it, I get the water eyes
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry momma, I apologize
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I'm sorry momma, I apologize
