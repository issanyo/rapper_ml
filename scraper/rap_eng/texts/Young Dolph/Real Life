[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah you know I came up from shit man
Literally
Know what I’m sayin’, but don’t nothing stay the same forever though, ya’ mean?
Yeah

[Hook]
I ain’t never wanted nothin’ in my whole life but some fucking money
(That’s all I ever wanted)
Fuck them bitches, they gon’ always be around young nigga, ‘long as you get your money
(Ay fuck them bitches young nigga, get your paper)
Got enough choppers in the attic to supply a whole army (ay, HEY!)
And if you getting real cake in these streets, you better watch your closest homies (better watch ‘em)

[Verse 1]
I done seen a broke nigga get rich
I done seen a rich nigga go broke
I done seen a college girl turned to a ho
I done seen a spoiled young nigga start kicking doors
I know these bitches watching, let me strike a pose
Everything gone, nigga the trap closed
I almost died, I came that close
But grandma always prayed for me, that’s why I’m still in it
Flipped over in a fatal car wreck and I'm still living
No matter wherever I go I'm still Memphis
I know a 60 year old nigga still pimpin’
And a 60 year old nigga still crippin’

[Hook]
I ain’t never wanted nothin’ in my whole life but some fucking money
(That’s all I ever wanted)
Fuck them bitches, they gon’ always be around young nigga, ‘long as you get your money
(Ay fuck them bitches young nigga, get your paper)
Got enough choppers in the attic to supply a whole army (ay, HEY!)
And if you getting real cake in these streets, you better watch your closest homies (better watch ‘em)

[Verse 2]
You can’t come up because you loyal to the wrong shit
Won’t be loyal to the plug but loyal to the bitch
I just got 50 in, I just hit a lick
Bust down Dae Dae, look at the flick of the wrist
I used to didn’t have shit
Now I got a whole lot of everything
A lot of nigga’s bitches on my dick
And a whole lot of gold chains
And a whole lot of bread nigga
That come with a lot of head nigga
You could’ve took the same chances that I took but you was scared nigga
Thumbin’ through a check, plottin’ on the next one
Live life to the fullest ‘cause you only get one
Whatever I go buy, I go get the best one
Dolph Gabana, nothing like the rest of ‘em

[Hook]
I ain’t never wanted nothin’ in my whole life but some fucking money
(That’s all I ever wanted)
Fuck them bitches, they gon’ always be around young nigga, ‘long as you get your money
(Ay fuck them bitches young nigga, get your paper)
Got enough choppers in the attic to supply a whole army (ay, HEY!)
And if you getting real cake in these streets, you better watch your closest homies (better watch ‘em)
