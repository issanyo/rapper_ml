[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I crack me a seal, pour me a 8
I stay fresh as fuck, and that's everyday
Allergic to fuck niggas, get out my way
Pull up in something stupid like who wanna race?
Young nigga in the hood sellin' weight
When it come to my paper I don't got no patience
Your conversation boring, I can't listen
Only money keep my attention
Had her breaking down p's all night
Work a bitch like my name Ike
What's love got to do with it
I fuck her once then I'm through with it
Throwback Sacramento king shit
If you ain't see me, you ain't see shit
Bought a root beer and poured lean in it
Every family got a dope fiend in it
Might pour a whole 16 in it
I been fucking these niggas bitches
That's just what we do in South Memphis
Ay, nah we don't love em we share em
We flip 'em then pass 'em
Spent 100 thou on my favourite fashion
I smoke weed just to meditate
Got yo bitch and your sister on a double date

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I hopped out the Porsche then I hopped in the Lamb
Hopped out the Lamb then hopped in the Benz
Hopped out the Benz then hopped in your bitch
Drop that bitch off and went picked up her friend
Damn that Dolph nigga did it again, yeah he shitted again
All of my niggas, my niggas to the end
All of em family I ain't got no friends
I don't associate with fuck niggas cause we don't speak the same language
Nah, I don't entertain broke bitches, they the type of hoes I stay away from, uh
I did all this shit off of 16 zips, I did all this shit off of 16 zips
Cracked a seal I got 16 zips, I did all this shit off of 16 zips

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I did all this shit off of 16 zips
Hop out the Lamb with the Glock .19 and a 30 round clip
Pouring medicine in my drink til its filthy
I was born a street nigga yeah I'm guilty
Spent 150 on golden diamonds
You can see from across the street shining
You can hear me round the corner coming
Smoking out the pound, getting blunted
Monday night I'm in Magic City, eating steak and shrimp and I'm throwing money
I'm too anxious, don't know how to wait
Poppin' painkillers, countin' cake
Got yo bitch at the spot cleaning up, smoking weed wearing lingerie
Look at the rocks on my wrist
Look at that ass on my bitch
Yeah I keep a Glock on my hip
Smell like a pound when I'm shopping at 5th
Did all this shit off of 16 zips, I did all this shit off of 16 zips
When I found me a new plug, back to back to 16 trips

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I hopped out the Porsche then I hopped in the Lamb
Hopped out the Lamb then hopped in the Benz
Hopped out the Benz then hopped in your bitch
Drop that bitch off and went picked up her friend
Damn that Dolph nigga did it again, yeah he shitted again
All of my niggas, my niggas to the end
All of em family I ain't got no friends
I don't associate with fuck niggas cause we don't speak the same language
Nah, I don't entertain broke bitches, they the type of hoes I stay away from, uh
I did all this shit off of 16 zips, I did all this shit off of 16 zips
Cracked a seal I got 16 zips, I did all this shit off of 16 zips
