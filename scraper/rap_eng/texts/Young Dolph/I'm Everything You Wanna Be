[Intro]
Zaytoven
Uh-huh
It's Dolph
Ayy, ayy
Got my ice on
Smokin' killer

[Chorus]
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (hey)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I just do it)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I dunno know)
I just do it, (I just do it), I just do it (ayy, ayy)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it
Yeah, I just do it, yeah (ooh)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (yeah, yeah)
I just do it, (yeah, yeah), I just do it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Started out with nothin' but wanted everythin' (ayy)
Turned into reality, it started as a dream (yeah)
Ran that money up and I built my own team (I built my own team)
Grew up watchin' Master P and Baby on the TV screen (yeah)
I had to hustle, my family full of dope fiends (damn)
Years go by I'm 18, 19 (trap)
Neighborhood dope boy, I got what you need (dope boy)
Everyday I get up, I put J's on my feet (uh-huh)
I'm in the trizzap, posted in the paint like LeBron (LeBron)
Memphis is to Dolph what Cleveland is to LeBron (it's Dolph)
Writin' million dollar checks but I still keep a Glock (still keep a Glock)
Built my own empire, nigga, like Jay-Z with the roc (nigga, hey)

[Chorus]
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (hey)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I just do it)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I dunno know)
I just do it, (I just do it), I just do it (ayy, ayy)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it
Yeah, I just do it, yeah (ooh)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (yeah, yeah)
I just do it, (yeah, yeah), I just do it, yeah

[Verse 2]
Just count that first million, did the Diddy dance (take that, take that)
Been gettin' money, I ain't seen you in a minute, man (what's poppin'?)
I turned myself into a business man (it's Dolph)
Do you get it, man? (Hey, hey)
Just seen ski masks hop out they mini van (woo)
You 'bout to get it, man, I'd hate to be you, man (I'm sorry)
Call me J. Prince 'cause I trap a lot (legend, ha)
I may not rap a lot, that cash what I'm about (yeah)
First I pray for it, then I hustle for it (ayy)
Just livin' life, wake up and roll the dice (yeah, yeah)
Put everythin' on the line, you gotta sacrifice (take a chance)
Used to playin' in the dirt now we covered in ice

[Chorus]
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (hey)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I just do it)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (I dunno know)
I just do it, (I just do it), I just do it (ayy, ayy)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it
Yeah, I just do it, yeah (ooh)
Don't ask me how I do it, I just do it (yeah, yeah)
I just do it, (yeah, yeah), I just do it, yeah
