[Verse 1: Mckinley Ave]
65, 75, 85, 95
I remember when a nigga first started off
A nigga maybe had 25
Nigga that 25, quick turned to a 45
Cause that 9 piece with that 5 weeks
Turn and flipped the bag into a whole pie
Then another whole pie and then another whole pie
Now she get a car and she get a car
And she get a car like I'm Oprah
Cause money ain't no problem
Cause bitches ain't no problem
Them niggas ain't no problem
And cops ain't no problem so
I'mma go hustle some more
Cause most of our time is been chasin' the dough
And most of your time has been chosen' some hoes
And you wonder why you never got some hoes
So nigga get your money right
And all of them hoes comin'
Niggas that some main thing
So lemme let you know somethin' about that

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
100 bands, 100 rounds
100 hoes, 100 pounds
100 grand, I'm the man
Took a trip just to score a bitch tree from the land
Your bitch with you but she love me
Cause you can't do it like I can
Damn, you say you hustlin' but you love these bitches
I'm in my traphouse runnin' up these digits
I had to fire that bitch cause she didn't listen
Bitch that's bad business, gotta make better decisions
My mama need her rent paid
My nephew need some shoes
My cousin smart as fuck but broke
So I say fuck school
It's the shit you just do
And some shit you don't
My teacher had the nerve
To ask what I want and I said

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
100 bands, oh yeah it's going down
I made 100 bands, some swiper shit outta town
I never sold no packs but went to work with them swipies
Hit up the mall, fuck up a cheque, on your wifey
With this type of money, I'm bound to be a homewrecker
Keep at home, I'm gon' catch
Your bitch a dog, I'm gon' fetch ya
100 bands, oh yeah, I had to make it
Ain't no way I was gon' fake it way before I made it
So I hit the road and went to work
Every time you made your bitch mad, went and got her a purse
100 bands, 100 bands
Oh what a feelin', just to make 100 bands
