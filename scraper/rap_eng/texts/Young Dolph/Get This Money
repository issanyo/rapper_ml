Trappin', trappin', trap, trappin', trappin', trappin'
Trappin', trappin', trap, trappin', trappin', trappin'
Trappin' out  a mansion

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
If you ain't talkin' money I don't wanna talk (I'll call you back)
You can tell I got that sack by the way I walk
I'm the shit, face it (face it!)
You niggas basic, bought a half a P to smoke it
A pint of purple to chase it
I'm sippin' on a Codeine Margarita
My mexican bitch I call her my mamacita
I met her brother now I got work for a little cheaper
They immigrants don't suppose to be here so they illegal
He looked at me and said we gonna get the money bet
I said bet, nothin' but respect
Nigga you know I'm all about a check
My old school worth more than a new 'Vette
Fucking other niggas' bitches, I call that new sex

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Roll it up my nigga, roll it up I'm richer
I was rollin' up before I was old enough
Work the color of a coconut
Put holes in your shirt like a polka dot
Doughnuts in the parking lot
Dope boy with an Audemar
What I make today I spend it all tomorrow
I got a stripper bitch on my screensaver
Look at me, you don't need cable
Pockets on Lee Haney
My best friend is a 380
Big rims, no teenagers
That deuce deuces and deuce fours
Deuce sixs and deuce eights
Y'all sweet, toothaches
I'm killin' these beats man I need to get a suit made
I'm so cold man I need to get some soup made
Self paid, I be talkin' to myself like
