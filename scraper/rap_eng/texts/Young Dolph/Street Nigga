All day every day I’m a street nigga
And I wouldn’t be shit without the streets nigga
Lesson learned, money stacked

Cash get them money flippin’ with the blue hunnids

All my niggas round me gettin’ hella cake
Take the worst stake to stake catch a triple play
Dream nigga every day, all day
Real situation true niggas eaten
Were caviar dreamin
Made myself a boss

Got my pockets spend my own check
On these Capin’ ass fuck niggas

No swishers nigga

Sip the best drank
Old school nigga with the wet paint

Hopped out the mf Porsche in high school
Turned to a street nigga
RIP my nigga Jimmy Dean
Real street nigga, he the one who turned me to a street nigga
You won’t believe me

Now they want to see me
Cuz I came from the bottom but I made it look easy
Y’all niggas sticking to the street code
Getcho money, getcho money, nogga get the hell on
That would be a street nigga goal
I know that’s every street nigga goal

[Verse 4: Young Dolph]
