[Hook]
Momma and daddy used to be a crack addict
I never go back broke, keep a milli in the attic
Remember sleepin' on the floor, down badly
Fast forward, the young nigga living lavish
If you see her with me, she one of the baddest
You see all these motherfucking diamonds dancing
And all of these racks stuffed inside my pants, damn
And I got your girl P poppin' on a handstand

[Verse 1]
Dope boys do what they wanna
Suckers do what they can
Bad red bitch with me
She talkin' bout she need a tan
Every five days nigga, that's another hundred grand
Hatin' on me around your bitch
You just making that bitch a fan
Can't make up my mind whether
I want a Lambo or Rarri
Wish my grandma was here
Just so I could tell her I'm sorry
Sorry for having all of them pounds of weed in your gardens
Now I get 30 just to walk in and turn up and party
When there wasn't no more room I slept on the floor
Bitch I just hit the strip club, threw some stacks on the floor
Hey, I just cut the lights on when I walked in the door
Quarter milly worth of ice, just look how it glow
Don't pull on the side of me, boy your car too slow
Them hitters right beside me, they shoot when I say go
I get too fucking high, don't know how to lay low
All I know is street money, R.I.P to Bankroll

[Hook]
Momma and daddy used to be a crack addict

If you see her with me, she one of the baddest
You see all these motherfucking diamonds dancing
And all of these racks stuffed inside my pants, damn
And I got your girl P poppin' on a handstand

[Verse 2]
Keep a whole lotta gualla with me
And a whole lotta shottas with me (Nigga you ain't Jamaican)
I mean a lot of shooters with me
Slow down on lean, it's fucking up my kidneys
If she thick, I give that girl a business
With the shit, nah we don't leave no witness
Between me and them, yeah it's a big difference
They some fuck niggas but I'ma keep it pimpin'
She met a real nigga and started catching feelings
My car goes real fast and it ain't got no ceiling
I smoke exotic gas and my root beer filthy
I killed that pussy last night, she said I'm guilty
I slammed the whole pack, the plug got me ballin'
My jeweler flooded me with alkaline water
I told your momma thank you for your fine ass daughter
Then called my plug and placed another order

[Hook]
Momma and daddy used to be a crack addict

You see all these motherfucking diamonds dancing
And all of these racks stuffed inside my pants, damn
And I got your girl P poppin' on a handstand
