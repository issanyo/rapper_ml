[Intro: Samuel L. Jackson]
AK-47, the very best there is. When you absolutely, positively, got to kill every motherfucker in the room; accept no substitutes


[Hook]
I got your bitch on my dick and I got money on my mind
[?] nothing but money on my line
Got 30 on my watch still keep up with the time
According to the streets, it's my motherfucking time
Now young nigga doin' gang signs
When I look in the mirror, all I see is dollar signs
According to this [?], bitch it's my time
It's my time, yeah, it's my time

[Verse 1]
Yeah bitch, it's my time
Spent a brick on my left wrist
And all that smoking, staying high times
[?]
Fucked your bitch without trying
Fuckniggas saying my name, and watch me pull up with the Glock, now

[Interlude]
Hold up, hold up
Found this A-plus
Now, let's get back to this shit
It's Dolph

[Hook]
I got your bitch on my dick and I got money on my mind
[?] nothing but money on my line
Got 30 on my watch still keep up with the time
According to the streets, it's my motherfucking time
Now young nigga doin' gang signs
When I look in the mirror, all I see is dollar signs
According to this [?], bitch it's my time
It's my time, yeah, it's my time

[Verse 2]
Yeah bitch, it's my time
Spent a brick on my left wrist
And all that smoking, staying high times
Eyes red [?]
Fucked your bitch without trying
Fuckniggas saying my name, and watch me pull up with the Glock, now
One foot in the traphouse
One foot in the rap booth
The type of nigga that sacked up over your bitch house and leaving residue
I don't give a fuck, yeah I'm rude
Been doing this shit since highschool
Don't give a fuck about my bitch's feelings
So fuck a nigga with an attitude
Shooting as you turn on my streets, you smell that killa-kush, yeah
Everytime that nigga come around, I smell pussy
I'm heavyweight, you're a feather
I just might go Federer
Designer-gear from head to toe with clear rocks in my pistol
Bitch

[Hook]
I got your bitch on my dick and I got money on my mind

Got 30 on my watch still keep up with the time

Now young nigga doin' gang signs
When I look in the mirror, all I see is dollar signs
According to this [?], bitch it's my time

[Verse 3]
Come through my hood and everybody [?]
I'm just relaxing at the spot getting rid of these peeps
Polosweater, polo[?]
Got a bad bitch flew in from Portland
She at the peak by wearing nothing
5 pounds left in, I'm coming
Crazy shit I used to fuck a cousin
Well uhh, that's a a whole other subject
Ghetto bitch was too loud in public
Long hair, fat ass, no manners
Bitch head was so good
That I stayed down in her throat like throat cancer
Texted my plug one time, two days later flipped the whole city
Ran through the city of Memphis
Drug traffic, your bitch with me
Young nigga hit a hundred thousands in all twenties in the attic, nigga
Pounds allowed in the mansion, nigga
Pounds already in the cabin, nigga

[Hook]
I got your bitch on my dick and I got money on my mind
[?] nothing but money on my line
Got 30 on my watch still keep up with the time
According to the streets, it's my motherfucking time
Now young nigga doin' gang signs
When I look in the mirror, all I see is dollar signs
According to this [?], bitch it's my time
It's my time, yeah, it's my time
