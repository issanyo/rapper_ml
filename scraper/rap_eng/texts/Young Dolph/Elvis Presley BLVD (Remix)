[Intro]
Hood Billionaire, uh, yeah, check
(Ay, Rosay, where you at?)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Second album of the year, I'm on my trap shit
Make a skinny ho pay me like a fat bitch (uh-uh)
Fly the Mulsanne like a plane, a boss behind tint
Grandaddy was a player, Uncle Sam a pimp (HUH)
All I wanna see is my dawgs get a shot at this
Lookin at my jewels, them pussy niggas shot and missed
Chop the top off my new car, ain't no fear in my heart
80 shots in this new chopper, 69 ya broad
LeBron went back to Cleveland, I should buy a crib
But this spot ain't big enough for how this fat boy live
Lemon pepper now Louisiana rub
I let my top down, pussy niggas throw it up
305, them boys'll tell you bout some food
That's why I fucked yo bitch at Holyfield pool
Fucked her like a man, should've heard the splash
Paperview my pimpin', niggas COD my cash
Blowin' Swisher sweets all in yo bitch's ass
I should claim these pussy niggas on my income tax
50 racks go to Black at the roulette table
Same ones slept on the floor with me with basic cable
Sideways I'm in the Wraith coming out hard
As I slide down Elvis Presley BLVD
Time to say a prayer so nigga bow your head
And you better wash your hands in my grace land

[Hook 1: Rick Ross]
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the hard
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Boy I used to blow that dope boy sack at Southland Mall
Old school Chevy, Elvis Presley BLVD
Big bag, prescription pills, we call 'em bass guitars
Got bricks, that Lisa Presley, get it soft or hard
R-rose gold Ros√© and the Rollie pink
Hoes in the ship, you know it's bound to sink
Never brung to prison, it had a boss think
If you a fuck nigga, we'll never link
I'm in bid'ness with hittas and killas
My niggas gorillas who ball like the Grizzlies
Rest of these niggas be refugee niggas
And referee niggas who blow on the whistle
Come to my city, I'm like A C. Wharton
Nigga, yeah I'm the mayor
In an old school 'Lac like Issac Hayes
At Preface sippin' Belaire, bitch I'm in the hood

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they could go and get the dogs

[Verse 3: MJG]
I'm riding down E-L-V-I-S P-R-E-S-L-E-Y
Shades on my face, you can tell he high
Three white bitches, gettin head like a whale
Three black bitches with a tail like a whale
One fat bitch, when I fucked her off of the side of the bed
She fell like a whale
Straight through the floor, down to the den
Drum through the hoes, start pounding again
Look at me now, I'm pounding again
She so wet, I'm drowning again
Pimp type, MJG
Tell them crackers go get the dogs
And when dogs don't find nothing
You can tell them crackers go kiss them balls
Kiss them balls? Yeah, treat 'em as if was a mistletoe
A pimp riding down Elvis Presley, nigga, get yo ho
You know she was reckless, I'm ballin, I'm a sight to see
She was just choking on that boy and that's yo wife to be

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
Robbery, on the routine, face and chopper on yo faces
Masked up just like Ku Klux Klan but we are not racist
A pistol and a scale'll get a nigga ass in
Key of hard, if you get caught, put in federal pins (locked down)
Moving bricks like a contractor, a pebble at a time
Broke down a quarter chicken, hard and moved it dime for dime
Memph-ghanistan, take from the rich and sell dope to the poor
If our pockets ever get low, we kick in yo door
I got no patience with these plugs, I have to pull  the socket
Damn my boy caught a case and his mouth shot off like a rocket
If you suckas get caught in jammies and tell on ya mammies
If they gave awards out for snitchin', y'all'll get a Grammy

[Hook 2]

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Pull up on the boulevard, hop out on them niggas slow
I don't fuck with y'all, but I know I probably fucked yo ho
Police on the boulevard, hop out on them niggas slow
Shoot it out in the morning, death around the corner
Ain't dyin' in a prison ho
I'm the mayor of the city, you can't stand the reign
Like Timbaland and Missy, get the fuck out of Memphis
We heavy-hitters, dope dealers, stone-cold killers
Hustle, get money niggas, mob niggas, call a hit, we rob niggas
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD
My trunk full of AR's wit a bunch of ratchet bitches
That'll fuck yo chick, beat a rape charge
Nigga this Memphis, choppers in yo mouth like a dentist
Watch out here with you fuckin with
And watch out that snake bitch sucking dick
I'mma legend in this streets, high as fuck, Al Green
Sitting sideways, gone off that Isaac Hayes
Ric Flair, white hair, metric tons frying in grease
I'm all in the kitchen, chicken four-piece

[Hook 2]

[Verse 6: Young Dolph]
Hold up, put that weed out, po-pos pullin us over
Black ass nigga in a new drop with a new Rollie
I'm drive this bitch like its stolen
I fucked yo bitch just for promotion
And sent her out to go pick up some work from Oakland
Uh, yeah I'm doing 180 down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got a trap house 'round the corner from Elvis Presley crib
My motor in the rear, Margiela sneakers shiftin' gears
Blunt of cookie behind my ear
My bitch calling back-to-back talkin' 'bout "where you at?"
