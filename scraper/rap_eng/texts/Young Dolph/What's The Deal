[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
One hand on the wheel, one hand on her thigh
She start giving me head while she look me in my eye
For my nigga I'd kill, for my nigga I'd die
Can't wait to get to the crib, I'ma fuck her from the side
You was in the house nigga, I was outside
Fifteen years old, sellin' dope and getting high
Spent an easy forty stacks in Saks, just on getting fly
Playing with the wrong nigga, he must wanna die
Bought a Rari just to take it to the trap and park it
Spent twenty stacks and threw a barbecue in the apartments
Rich humble and heartless
Pulled up at the red light, push a button, my car got topless
I wake up in the morning, pour up syrup, I don't drink coffee
My lil bitch too bossy
Try to fuck with us, she act like she don't hear you talkin' (deaf)
Ain't never trust a nigga ever since my cousin crossed me (fuck 'em)
Ain't never trust a nigga ever since my cousin crossed me (fuck 'em)

[Chorus]
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real

[Verse 2]
Every time I fuck my bitch I fuck her 'til she scream
I remember when all this shit was just a dream
Yeah I love my straps, they come with infrared beams
Yeah I love my straps, they come with infrared beams
Smokin' on gelato, flyin' through southside Chicago
In a Porsche, I'm dodging potholes
Living life like no tomorrow
Or I'm out in California, my Mexican bitch house, eating tacos
I get money with my vato (Jose)
My role model El Chapo (trap)
All these rocks on me, my lil white bitch she call me Rocko
My OG's keep blue rags tied 'round their head like Leonardo
My lil nigga he keep his purple flag like Donatello
In the hood in a Lambo, smokin' a blunt of jello

[Chorus]
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real

[Outro]
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real
Nigga what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal
Fuck how you feel, how you feel, how you feel
I been countin' mil after mil after mil
All these diamonds real, all my niggas real
