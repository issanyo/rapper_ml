[Chorus]
What these bitches want from a nigga (Yeah)
If they ain't with me they against me fuck them niggas (for real)
I ain't got time for doing shit but counting skrilla
What these bitches want from a nigga, what they want x 3

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]

I ain't got time to spend but I got cake to spend
My lil' bitch hate that shit she said she can't take this shit
I feel like I just hit the lotto I'm smokin' on a Gelato
She hand me my pistol before I walked out of the house yeah that's my lil' rado
I only smoke nothing but fire I pour up codeine to get higher
A million dollars later (what happened) I just told my plug I retire
I smoke a zip everyday but I can't keep up with a lighter
I'm a shit talking Rolex wearing ass nigga like Ric Flair
A real dope boy that send packs all over the city everywhere
A fast car driving Dolce and Gabbana suit wearing ass nigga
Ol' 5 gram blunt smoking [?] now I'm smelling ass nigga
Lil mama blowing me up she done had too much liquor

Chorus x 1

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]

I jump in my whip back out the garage
I got two bitches on 3 way they wanna have a minaj
I told them all I want is some head and a massage
Head so good when she got through I gave her a round of a applause
Just caught another charge. Beat another case
In a club drinking codeine pouring out that ace
Daddy yo thats my brother my mother fucking ace
2 million dollars cash in a mother fucking safe
Out here saving all these hoes nigga you need a cape
All this money on the floor I need a fucking rake
$3,000 dollar Cartiers on my fucking face
Just left Wells Fargo and pulled up at Chase

Chorus x 1
