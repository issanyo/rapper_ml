[Hook]
Got a spot in the sober, as a trap house in the section attic
A coupe the front lawn with that camera battle license plate
My watch cost a whip, my whip costs a crip
To get to the place I'm at
You won't believe half of the shit I did
Each to know about the better of chances
What you know about the life with dead chances
When I'm in the streets I'm all about taking chances
I gotta get it under all circumstances

[Verse 1]
Ain't no streets, you gotta learn to take the bad with the good
When you think you're doing bad, you're doing good
They ask me how I've been, I say "I've been doing good"
Ask the streets about me, they say that little nigga keep good
All the way to Meneth, let's get this understood
The illest nigga in this shit, I put that on my hood
Ain't no nigga  from my city done it like I done it
Speedin' in that 2-seater, can hear me when I'm coming
Glancing in my camera, no I don't like in the rearview
Riding with dick hood bitch out the [?]
Traiting ass rappers i hear you, but I don't feel you
I [?] about getting old, nigga you [?]

[Hook]
Got a spot in the sober, as a trap house in the section attic

To get to the place I'm at
You won't believe half of the shit I did
Each to know about the better of chances
What you know about the life with dead chances
When I'm in the streets I'm all about taking chances
I gotta get it under all circumstances

[Verse 2]
Spark a hundred, lost a hundred
Invest two hundred and lost two more
I've done a lot of dirty shit, so I can't complain
I took it and roll, losses come with the game
Wouldn't been the man I am today if I didn't take a chance
I play with that [?] bitch and took her out to dance
I'mma tell you this here
Then you might be prepared to stay with her
I build my own lane and I ran with it
Got my [?] doing the whole [?]
Its called get rich or either die tryin'
Let's say I'm getting fly, so I might die flying
