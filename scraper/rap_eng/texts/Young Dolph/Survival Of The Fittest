Survival of the fittest
Respect my come-up
Survival of the fittest
Boy you better not run off
Survival of the fittest
Grown man, I let my nuts hang
Survival of the fittest
Come here, put that dirt on everything

[Verse 1]
Teacher said I was gonna either go to jail or get killed
But now I got a black coupe, with a chrome grill
One time me and mister T was headed to the CTO
The police brought us over, I jumped out on the hood with half a bow
They threw me in the backseat, I still have my bong in my [?]
I snuck that shit up under the seat, they let me out the police car
True story, and I put it on everything that I love
Me, frequent them [?] big Hondas
Just go ask my plug
We used to break them trees down before in, out the school
But I couldn't drop out, because grandma was going at the fool
Hell, I think I've seen murder
[?]
Got your bitch in the [?] smoking

[Verse 2]
Staying down till I came up
Never knew how to change [?]
In the trap getting my change up
Fuck i wanna change, fuck
Been rocking too much ice lately, so I don't talk to strangers
In a trap I've been [?]
All in them dangers
Them rap niggas they scared of me
They feel like I'm gonna take their spot
Truth be told I ain't gotta rap
I can go platinum album out my trapspot
Fuck a trap house i got a trap block
Say he got four racks for a halftime, that's trap talk
A hundred rounds where I lay my head
Bodycount in my trapyard
I put lil' momma head in my lap, you can say she gave me her laptop
Marijuana leaves, that's my mascot
And if you give a cig, I might blast off
Magic stick the rap game up
