[Intro: Dolph]
Aye Gucci you know we got this new spot
We been trapping like a bitch

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I’m in the hood going crazy with that work
I’m in the section 8 moving A Plus
I’m in the hood going crazy with that work (stupid)
The long hot bubba I don’t give a fuck
I’m in the hood going crazy with these P’s
Gucci got a super deal on the keys
They say we got the streets sprung on that stupid
Now all they wanna shop with is Dolph and Gucci

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Me and Gucci just went and got a new trap house
A two story house buildingg just for us to trap out
Dolph and that boy Gucci trap roommates
I fill yo bitch mouth full of cum like its toothpaste
My britches sagging full of money, my styrofoam muddy
Po a of in a gingivale now it taste like bubbly
I make this shit look fun nigga thats why yo kid love me
But yo sister and yo cousin and yo bitch wanna fuck me
I’m in the hood pumpin’ weight going crazy
Sacking’ up these bales gucci cookin’ up them babies
And the same bitch you kissing on calling’ baby
She asked me to nut in her and let you think thats yo baby
