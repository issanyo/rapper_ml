That bitch seen all that money, and it drove that ho insane
My wrist game insane
Bitch you know my name
All I think about is money, you should do the same
Ever since I started sellin bells, my life ain't been the same
I drive these bitches insane, I drive these bitches insane
My mama say I got to many bitches, I should be ashamed
I drive these bitches insane, My wrist game insane
That bitch seen all that money and it drove that ho insane

[Verse 1]
Life's good, I can't complain
Since I met my plug, my life ain't been the same
I ain't never ever ever asked a nigga for shit since I been in the game
But oh yeah, I did fuck yo bitch because she said you lame
Fuck boy, you a peewee
Been rap hustlin and drug smugglin
Can't stop cause I'm greedy
In other words, what I'm tryna say, the rap game industries need me
Pulled right up in yo drive way to pick up yo bitch I'm like BEEP BEEEEPP!!!(disrespectful)
Nigga tell that bitch to come outside, another bitch in the car with me, 3D
But thats the type of shit that she like because she a freak
Bet all her neighbors know my whole name, I drive these bitches insane
