[Intro]
Hit 'em with the Jab
Buddah blessed this beat

[Chorus]
Whole lotta of drip (drip)
Money callin' back to back so I keep takin' trips (go get it)
Spend a couple mil (yeah), just on one crib (yeah)
Hold up, let me crack the seal, take another sip (pour up)
Whole lotta drip (drip)
Whole lotta drip (drip), whole lotta chips (baow)
I'm a slave owner (what?), whole lotta whips (skrrt)
I don't like niggas (nah), I might get 'em killed (bah)
He like poppin' pills (thirties), I like countin' mils (ayy)
