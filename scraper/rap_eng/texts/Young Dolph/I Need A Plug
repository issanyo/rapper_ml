[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired of bein' the man in the middle like Malcom
I nee da number on Lu-Lu or Pablo to send them things through, I'm way down 'em
Yeah he got work and he peon
Put the squeeze on him, Capri Sun
I took the ball and I ran with it
People compare me to Dion (Sanders)
I'm making juggs around the city
But I swear I need a bigger package
We need them bales and vacuum seals
Rock santan, saran wrap it
Baby even said she need a plug
[?] to sell some make-up and some hair
If you got it be consistent with it
When I wire the money, send it through the air
(Nah, nah I ain't got nothin' right now, part time ass dope boy)
Guess I gotta take a trip for it
Train mission, catch him slipping, hit licks for it
I need them sticks, them percs, them syrup
That heroin, that dog [?], that dope boy stress
Smokin' kush like cigarettes
Don't ask me what's wrong 'cause nigga I told you

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
New car 'cross the front yard, pitbulls in the back yard
Fifty call on my waistline, shooting first, I don't waste time
This the trap, not play time, in the trap where I made mine
Double wrap that shit four times
Rolled straight past the canine
Smokin' kush and drinkin' Act, I'm a drug addict
Got three hundred racks around the corner in grandma attic
I need a plug, I went and found him
I ain't never did shit but sell me some dope
Ayy, fourteen years old I said I ain't gon' never be broke, yeah
Nothing in my stash house but money up on the floor, uh
Chopper up under my coat, yeah
Gelato, that's all I smoke, uh
This lil yellow Cali bitch just asked me where I'm from
And why I'm out in Oakland, why I come
And I said

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey

[Verse 3: MoneyBagg Yo]
All these juggs needed more consignment
Where the plug, man he need to find me
Treat the dope game like the rap game
Tell the plug, man he need to sign me
The profits on drugs that is
The only way a nigga convinced in this rap shit
Wanna make some money then book a nigga
Get some shows, it's fuck all this trap shit
Let's hit the highway, let's hit the road
Let's go and meet the connect
Let's bring it back, let's go to work
Let's turn a Mustang to a 'Vette
I don't give a fuck how broke I get
I'll never let you see me sweat
I'll go and break a bitch quick
Then I'm right back to ballin', hit nothin' but net
Don't talk 'bout that dope on the internet
Pull up on me, nigga I'm in the 'jects
Got what you need, concession stand
Say what you need, okay bet
Say you want two, I try this for that
Say you want four, I try this for that
Just made a flip, that's an acrobat
Animal, you know the trap is my habitat

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey
I need a plug like Lu-Lu, I need a plug
I need a plug like Diego, I need a plug
I need a plug like Meech, I need a plug
I need a plug my nigga, I need a plug, hey
