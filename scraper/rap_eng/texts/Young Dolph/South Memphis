[Verse 1]
She asked me where i'm from, bitch i'm South Memphis
Where we known for gettin it, kingpin
Bumped into lil mama said she ain't seen me since way back then
When i was just selling pounds of strizzong, i wasn't rappin'
Young nigga just trappin', met her out in cali
She stayed out in the valley, but she said that she from dallas
Bitch i'm from castalia but I got plugs out in vegas
Smokin' chicken, eatin chicken, bitch i'm bumpin G-Train
Yeah nigga i'm from the same streets that made Craig
Thats why i'm in my trap house runnin' up this bread
A scared man's a dead man, might as well be dead
Shout out to them Glenview hoes, i swear they got some fye head(straight up)

Aye my nigga where you from, i'm from south memphis
But I get money around the whole mutha fuckin city
Everything I got, I got it on my own, nigga don't get dat shit twisted
Hit ya ass with that choppa, leave ya body twisted
Drinkin mud, hit da cup, leave ya mouth twisted
The folks runnin in on me, im straight through the back door jumpin fences
I just met my plug and did a give and go
I'm from where they say da dope get sloped and then you go and break a ho!
Robbin', pimpin', and sellin dope, thats that south memphis shit
Young nigga, big rims, loud pipes

Got bales around here, go around that corner if u want that white
