[Verse 1]
Run up on this fire, and get burnt lil' nigga (fire)
Spent a half of million just on furniture nigga (damn)
Paper Router business, it don't concern you lil' nigga (watch out)
Be careful who you call your friend, they turn on you nigga
I'm DUI right now, I don't belong behind the wheel (woah)
One thing about it, I'ma get money long as I live (woo)
I can't stop at that red light, I can't keep going, I don't yield
I can't do that deal if it ain't more than 8 mil'
Oh shit, got them M's and now he lit
100 thousand dollar investment, I invest on my wrist
All she do is run her mouth, tell that bitch to suck a dick
I was born a superstar, so I put one on my fist
I just smash, I don't kiss (nah)
Hit the gas, I'm in the wind
Hate to brag, but I'm the shit (hah)
Got some head when I was 6
I threw 30 in Magic (Magic) do that make me a trick? (what?)
House on the lake, but I don't even know how to fish (damn)

[Chorus]
Mothafuck the laws, fuck the law, fuck the law (fuck em all)
Flyin' down Elvis Presley in the race car (boulevard)
I been drinkin' raw, drinkin' raw, drinkin' raw (raw!)
White girl with me, and she look just like a Barbie Doll
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (racks)
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (racks!)
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (stacks)
If I take you out, bitch that's a million dollar date

[Verse 2]

Bodybuilder shit nigga, I came up pumpin' weight (uh)
They smile in yo face (yup) But really want yo place (yup)
Ain't nobody straight (fuck 'em) Just give me my cake (yeah)
My lil' bitch she gun thick, when she walk that thing shake
Trap nigga mentality, I don't put shit in my name (it's Dolph)
Name one nigga that ever gave me a dime, I'll give you a million
Name one bitch that I can't fuck, and I'll give you 2 million (hah!)
White girl with me, and she look just like a Barbie Doll (woah)
White girl with me, I just found out she a porn star (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Mothafuck the laws, fuck the law, fuck the law (fuck em all)
Flyin' down Elvis Presley in the race car (boulevard)
I been drinkin' raw, drinkin' raw, drinkin' raw (raw!)
White girl with me, and she look just like a Barbie Doll
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (racks)
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (racks!)
I just walked in Barneys, spent a 40 by mistake (stacks)
If I take you out, bitch that's a million dollar date
