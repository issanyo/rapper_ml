[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, guess what, dog

[Chorus]
I got ice all on my arms and rocks around my neck, bitch
Brand new coupe straight out the showroom floor, that's how you flex, bitch
Only problem I got is, "What car should I get next, bitch?"
Smash it from the back, looked at her friend and said, "You next, bitch" (Damn)
I love skinny girls, but I prefer to have a thick bitch
If she jump up in this Benz, I’m gon' fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon’ fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon' fuck up her lipstick (Damn)

[Verse 1]
Ben Frank, I live with, count that money real quick
Used to want a plug, went to Cali, took a field trip (Ha)
Everyday real lit (Lit), choker rocks real big (Rocks)
Them bad bitches love the kid, wanna fuck the kid, roll blunts for the kid (Yeah, yeah)
Before she got out of the car (Ayy, what you doin'?)
She had to fix her lip gloss, ha
VS's, they shine in the dark (Nighttime), roll the gelato and spark (Hey)
Screets left me with no heart (Hey), put on ice just to cover the scars (Hey)
A movie of my life story (What?), I wonder, do I sell it to Starz (Star)
That young nigga rich, I don't mind (Stupid), my bitch, she the shit, I don't mind (Ha)
I—I'm so smooth, I could drive my drop top and not get wet in the rain (Skrr)
Four, eighty, eighty, blue flame (yeah), Paper Route Frank my new name (Hey)
You sold out before I came (hey, hey), [?]

[Chorus]
I got ice all on my arms and rocks around my neck, bitch
Brand new coupe straight out the showroom floor, that’s how you flex, bitch
Only problem I got is, "What car should I get next, bitch?"
Smash it from the back, looked at her friend and said, "You next, bitch" (Damn)
I love skinny girls, but I prefer to have a thick bitch
If she jump up in this Benz, I’m gon' fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I’m gon' fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon' fuck up her lipstick (Damn)

[Verse 2]
Don’t compare me to nobody, please don't do it, I dare you (Uh-uh)
I'm the type of nigga to take 150 and put it in the Chevy (Racks)
I'm gettin' too much money, I stop eatin' meat and start eatin' salads (Wealthy)
Glock just pulled up on me, talkin' shit in the McLaren (Hey)
I bet I got more bitches in Dallas than the Mavericks (Star)
30 thousand just for a sofa because the fabric (Wooh)
Trap nigga but he legendary like Michael Jackson (Heeh)
How you go and spend all that money on drugs and fashion? (Uh)

[Chorus]
I got ice all on my arms and rocks around my neck, bitch
Brand new coupe straight out the showroom floor, that's how you flex, bitch
Only problem I got is, "What car should I get next, bitch?"
Smash it from the back, looked at her friend and said, "You next, bitch" (Damn)
I love skinny girls, but I prefer to have a thick bitch
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon' fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon' fuck up her lipstick
If she jump up in this Benz, I'm gon' fuck up her lipstick (Damn)
