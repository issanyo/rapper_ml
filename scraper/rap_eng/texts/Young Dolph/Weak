[Hook]
You fell in love, with the pussy
You weak nigga (You weak nigga!)
They sat you down, and you told
You weak nigga (You weak nigga!)
She fucked your homie, now you depressed
You weak nigga (You weak nigga!)
Let niggas ho you, that's disrespect
You weak nigga (You weak nigga!)

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
You fell out with your motherfucking right hand man bout some motherfucking bread
You a bitch nigga
Rule number one never break the G code
Never change no matter how broke or how rich nigga
Only one exception, no love for snitch niggas (I hate them!)
Fuck em' 100 round slug em' eat a dick nigga
Got two half a bricks around my neck nigga that's a Kilo
On that Scarface shit pull up in that Porsche like Al Pacino
I'm in the hood like Nino
Black ass motherfucker in the hood clocking scrilla
You fell in love with that bitch, you weak nigga
What the hell is you doing, she a freak nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Que]
You and your partner got to laughing bout a ho you tried to both fuck
And you went back pilow talking like a bitch, Nigga nah you ain't got no nuts
That ain't his fault that the ho you housing just chose up
You were suppose to just boss up, lil' nigga grow up
Catching feelings them the signs of a weak nigga
And pretty soon I bet she trick you out these streets nigga
You think she ain't out fucking round, boy you sleep nigga
You peak, the only time she calling when you on your feet nigga
That's cause she know you really a sweet nigga
The true definition of being weak nigga

[Hook]
