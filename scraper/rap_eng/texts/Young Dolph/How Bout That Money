[Hook: Big KRIT]
How 'bout that money?
How 'bout that money nigga?
How 'bout that money?
How 'bout that money nigga?
You talk about hoes
Bank accounts with hella dough
Hatin' on other folks
But you gettin' none of yours
How 'bout that money?
How 'bout that money nigga?
How' bout that money?
How 'bout that money nigga?
You talk about game
Foreign cars and diamond chains
Fuck what you saying
Nigga, really - you hella lame

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
How 'bout yo bitch?
She fucked me like last night
Now she don't call you back
Now she don't act right
How 'bout your hating friends that front when I'm on the town?
Really some bitch niggas, claiming it's going down
How 'bout them busty chicks?
How 'bout them stripper poles?
How 'bout them church girls who love to wear stripper clothes?
How 'bout she keep it shaking until she get bucket naked?
How 'bout she make a dollar and stop the procrastination?
How 'bout I been a king?
Lord of the gold rings
Really, I thought you knew
They nicknamed me high king
How about I make a note
To never ever going broke
Grabbed the [?] by it's throat
And never ever let it go

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
How 'bout my fit?
I'm fresh as a bitch
Wanna see what 60k look like?
Just look at my wrist
Aye, how 'bout that paper?
How 'bout my car?
I bought these diamond dancing like a motherfucking [?]
How 'bout that money?
I just smoked a onion
They asked me how I did it
Cause my city, I run it
Fell in love with your bitch
Cause her head was ironic
She get me sloppy really fast so I call her supersonic
You either sellin' dope or pimpin' bitches where I'm from
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Competition with myself and I already won
They get money a long time, they got a nigga sprung

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
How 'bout you keep it real?
How 'bout you make a move?
How 'bout you play the game?
How 'bout you pay some dues?
How 'bout you quit begging, and get off yo mama couch?
Way too much money to still be living at yo mama house
How 'bout you stop flexing?
Knowing your bills due
Stop with them sad stories
Nobody feels you
How 'bout you pay attention and peep how they do the pole?
Watch for them dirty laws, they kill you for being poor
How 'bout you get a buck?
Flip it and level up
Stack it and stack some more
Cause one stack just ain't enough
How 'bout I teach you class
You study, you have to pass
Pimping like 101
That lame shit will never last
