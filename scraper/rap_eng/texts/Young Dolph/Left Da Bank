Hello, oh Zay, what’s poppin’?
Oh, I’m finna pull up

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (woah, woah)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah, yeah!)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (ayy, yeah)
I just left the bank, uh I just left the bank (woo)

Yeah, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (woo)

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Huh, I just left the bizank (bank), smokin' on that stizank (stank)
Swervin' in a foreign, on the E-Way, on that drizank (lean)
And my lil' bitch with me, she so thick, that it’s a shizame (damn)
Yea, we got the same car, but mines cost more and it’s faster (zoom)
Naw, I don’t like rappers (naw), and my lil' bitch badder (bad)
Every other day, I’m at the bank makin' deposits (yup)
I carry a bookbag, I can’t do nothing with a wallet (rich racks)
Nine times out of ten, I probably got them racks on me (yeah)
Ten times out of ten, you know I got a strap on me (yeah)
All these golden diamonds 'round my neck like I’m King Tut (ayy)
You ain’t seen me, bitch, then you ain’t seen nothin'

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (woah, woah)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah, yeah!)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (ayy, yeah)
I just left the bank, uh I just left the bank (woo)
I just left the motherfuckin' bank (yeah, yeah)
Nigga, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (yeah, yeah)
Huh, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (uh huh!)
Yeah, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (woo)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Walked in the bank smilin' (ha), walked out the bank laughing (ha, ha, ha)
Cartier on my glasses (yeah), dumpin' gelato ashes (yeah)
Fifteen, start trappin' (trap), Ruger under my mattress (trap)
I ain’t never owed a nigga shit and I even pay all my taxes (I never owed a nigga shit!)
I just left the bank (uh), house by the lake (uh)
I just cut the front yard, had too many snakes (uh)
Ain’t nobody straight, in these streets nobody safe, ayy
I can’t fuck with these niggas cause they broke and petty (damn)
Rose gold Patek (Philippe), backseat watchin' Belly (yeah)
All I need in this life of sin (what's that?), me and my girlfriend (brr)
Makaveli

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (woah, woah)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah, yeah!)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (aye, yeah)
I just left the bank, uh I just left the bank (woo)
I just left the motherfuckin' bank (yeah, yeah)
Nigga, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (yeah, yeah)
I just left the motherfuckin' bank (uh huh!)
Yeah, I just left the motherfuckin' bank (woo)

[Outro: Young Dolph]
Nine times out of ten, I probably got them racks on me
Ten times out of ten, you know I got a strap on me
All these golden diamonds 'round my neck like I’m King Tut
You ain’t seen me, bitch, then you ain’t seen nothin'
