[Intro]
Ayeeee, yeah

[Verse 1]
That lil nigga in the city playin' in all them foreigns
Got your baby mama in the penthouse shootin' a porno
The only nigga to ever sell more P's than Boston George
Realest nigga in it, where my motherfuckin' award at?
I grew up without it so I had to go get it
Hard head, bad ass, lil nigga don't listen
Push one button in the coupe and it start up the ignition
I don't see no competition
I'm too focused on millions
I just walked out the trap
Duffle bag and the strap
My bitch is bad and I'm paid
100 just for my fade
Sent the 100 from LA
My ice too bright, where my shades?
That bitch too thick, what's her name?
Bitch I'm the man, I'm just sayin'

[Hook]
Diamonds with no flaws
My hoes come with no draws
Motherfuck the laws
Don't nobody wanna work but everybody wanna ball
It ain't about paper I don't answer that phone call
I want it all
I do what I want, I might buy a drop full of phones
My new bitch be thin, I put my old bitch on pause
Smellin' like a pound of kush walkin' through the mall
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 2]
Diamonds got no flaws
Your bitch got no walls
And I ain't got no ceilin'
Fuck you and your bitch feelin's
Jumped up out the space ship rockin' a Margiela sweater
Legend in the trap, boy they gave me a gold medal
If you ain't about your paper lil nigga you better
Stash a million in the backyard with my shovel
Found some bad bitches put 'em in a bed together
I'm a selfish nigga, all my bitches mine forever
Money countin' machine and some rubber bands
My neck full of bling, couple hundred grand
I'm the, I'm the man
That's all that I'm sayin'
Pitch a 100 pack of strong to 'em underhand

[Hook]
Diamonds with no flaws
My hoes come with no draws
Motherfuck the laws
Don't nobody wanna work but everybody wanna ball
It ain't about paper I don't answer that phone call
I want it all
I do what I want, I might buy a drop full of phones
My new bitch be thin, I put my old bitch on pause
Smellin' like a pound of kush walkin' through the mall
I want it all
I want it all
