[Hook: Young Dolph]
I ain’t gone even lie, you damn right I got a fuckin’ plug
I ain’t gone even lie, everything I got I got it out the mud
I ain’t gone even lie,I got a lot of hoes, but never been in love
I ain’t gone even lie, this clock right here it hold 30 slugs
I ain’t gone even lie, you damn right I got a fuckin’ plug
I ain’t gone even lie, everything I got I got it out the mud
I ain’t gone even lie,I got a lot of hoes, but never been in love
I ain’t gone even lie, this Glock right here it hold 30 slugs

Verse 1 - Young Dolph
My heart ain't got no feelings
My Glock got an extension
My favorite room to break down these collared greens is the kitchen
Rubberbandin money where my palms still itchin
Everything prada from my sweater to these britches
Now i dont fuck with them niggas
I dont fuck with them bitches
Dont get mad if i dont speak to you
Bro im just not friendly
In the trap slamdunkin these P's
Like Michael Finley
My dad used to do the same shit so i guess that its just in me
I ain't gonna even lie, im the plug in my neighborhood
Down in south memphis, but we smokin on that englewood
I ain't gonna even lie, yea im sprung on that designer shit
I just fired my old ho and went a got a finer bitch

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I ain’t gone even lie, you damn right I got a fuckin’ plug
I ain’t gone even lie, everything I got I got it out the mud
I ain’t gone even lie,I got a lot of hoes, but never been in love
I ain’t gone even lie, this clock right here it hold 30 slugs
I ain’t gone even lie, you damn right I got a fuckin’ plug
I ain’t gone even lie, everything I got I got it out the mud
I ain’t gone even lie,I got a lot of hoes, but never been in love
I ain’t gone even lie, this Glock right here it hold 30 slugs

Verse 2 - Gucci Mane
I got money but need more bread
See i dont talk but nigga talk dots on your forehead
I need gwala, im talkin big stacks
See im the type of nigga who put Forgi's on a new 'lac
I need hoes, matter fact i dont need no bitch
I dont need the time for it
Bitch can you suck my dick
Im tryin to get rich, and she dont make me shit
So i dont give a damn about it
Get your whole clique blitzed
Im callous, y'all niggas know how La Flare is
And them Rollies that im wearin is the rarest of the rarest
Scary but y'all niggas is the scariest
And ive seen some ugly hoes but your hoes is the ugliest
