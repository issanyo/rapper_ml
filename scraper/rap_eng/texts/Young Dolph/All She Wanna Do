[Hook: Young Dolph]
She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now

She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I got shit to do, I got people to see
Packs to move nigga places to be
A hundred bands just for the jewelry, usually
When you see me, I'm rocking 2 or 3
In the trap you ain't a fool like me
Pussy nigga you can't move like me
Now there ain't shit like us, I'ma stay performin' with 2 Glocks tucked
Pull up on yo bitch with the top missing
An hour later now yo bitch missin'
Where she at, she at South Memphis
I'll bring her back tomorrow when I'm finished
Said he want 30, I'ma send it, I ain't trippin' plug got plenty
Bought a V-Coupe just to serve in it and fuck nigga bitches
The lil deal you signed for, I spent that on a watch
The other deal that you signed for, I spent that on a car
I got into it with my business more cause I didn't wanna eat breakfast
Then all go went to shit, I just put on my shit and left

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now

She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now

[Verse 2: Jayfizzle]
Used to play Nintendo, now its all white in the all white tempo
Owned the block with my extendo, tryna get rich and feed my [?]
Get the money, fuck the bullshit, mind I know you feel my lingo
Dump the body in the river, now police is finding Nemo
Catch a pack bitch, don't worry bout no makeup
On the block bitch, I ain't tryna lay off
Paper chase serving dishes in the [?] like I'm a waiter
Hundred rounds in the chopper for a motherfucking hater
I just wanna trap, bitch you know my style
Fuck [?] cooking rocks and serving loud
GPA won't coordinate, but I'm serving 3.5
Everyday I went to high school, nigga I went to school high

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now

She just wanna fuck, but I just wanna trap
The only thing I trust is god and my strap
[?] knew I was a star, ever since I was a champ
Told my mama fuck cause I need some money right now
