[Verse 1]
I roll a blunt then smoke that
I roll a joint then smoke that
I call your bitch up and let her stroke that
I'm sorry my nigga but I had to poke that
That 4 nigga yep I still talk that
6 figure nigga still eating croquettes
Let em trap nigga, Wednesday morning I got 4 packs
But how I got em in, you'll never know that
Lil mama called asked me to come and jump in that
How I bounce around get money call me jumping Jack
Sellin peas and boxes of apple jacks
When I get done with this shit
I'm a sell my story on cinemax

[Hook]
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
My niggas sell dope, we don't sell our soul
When it come to this money, I don't trust a soul
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told

[Verse 2]
My boy went on a robbin' spree
I ain't a pimp, but I charge these bitches boppin fees
Niggas out here lying like they come from me
If you ain't spending racks then nigga you can't shop with me
I learned how to roll up, watching my uncle Pac
Remember day they was a fool with a fork and a pot
I must confess, hell yeah I'm sprung on strong pot
Bout to go and spend a 60 on this brown rock
Cinemax, HBO, pay per view nigga
Bring your home boy with you dawg and pay for 2 nigga
Too bad for these sailors, thou out for these shoes nigga
The game is to be sold, countin dollars scoop nigga!

[Hook]
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
My niggas sell dope, we don't sell our soul
When it come to this money, I don't trust a soul
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
The game is to be sold not to be told
