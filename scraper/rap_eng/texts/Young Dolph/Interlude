You know, it's like. A lot of these niggas get behind their microphones, and they talk this street shit, know what I'm sayin'?
And they not telling the whole fucking story about this street shit though. They're fucking these young niggas up. They're fucking these young nigga's heads up. They got niggas thinking that peaches and cream. Which I really like. This shit ain't peaches and cream. Know what I'm saying? It's like, they're glorifying certain parts about this shit, but they're not telling the whole fucking story about this shit
It's ups and downs in this shit. Know what I'm talking about?
It's like, niggas shed tears in this shit. Blood in this shit. Know what I'm talking about?
So that's why I name my shit High Class Street Music. I give niggas the whole mother fucking story on this shit. Niggas turned up and into something. Some niggas don't make it out. A couple of us do. But most of us don't. You smell me?
