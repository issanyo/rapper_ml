[Chorus]
Wake up and get the the racks
I push my grind to the max
Ain't got no time to relax
Everyday I spend
Gotta get it back

Bitch, I'm just stating the facts
World ain't gon' cut you no slack
Better go find you a sack
Catch me in the motherfucking trap

[Verse 1]
Money all on my mind
I can't even recline
I'm perfecting my grind
You ain't get into it
You are not my kind

6 cellphones ringing
Early, early in the morning
Birds just started chirping
Nerves just started working (Yeah)

FedEx  drop off the pack
Got my hoe waiting on that
Sit back and smoke me some wax
When it touch down, know I'm finna tax

I let her come to the trap
She blow me just like a sax
Then I let her go shop at Sax
My lifestyle, your Cinemax

Trapping in front of the barbershop
Trapping in front of the coffee spot
Trapping in front of the China Wok
Don't make no difference, I get the guap

Ain't no chill, 'til I'm way up
Making plays, busting lay-ups
All I know is get my cake up
I get to the racks when I wake up (Yeah)

[Chorus] 2x
Wake up and get the the racks
I push my grind to the max
Ain't got no time to relax
Everyday I spend
Gotta get it back

Bitch, I'm just stating the facts
World ain't gon' cut you no slack
Better go find you a sack
Catch me in the motherfucking trap

[v2]
Catch me in the trap where we dumping on [?]
We shooting at niggas or we shooting crack
We been getting money
You know that perhaps
You know what it is, you know where we at
Just pull up at the spot
You looking for threats
If I ain't got it, then my nigga do
In the trap rocking thousand-dollar tennis shoes
Every man for they-self
Ain't no motherfucking rules

Trap house full of damn fools
Twenty niggas in this bitch servin'
Stupid ass old school in the front yard
I call that motherfucker Judas Irving

Hell yeah, boy we getting it on
Getting them in, and we getting them gone
Drilled yo bitch for just thirty minutes
And sent her home, bitch I'm gone
Bitch be gone

[?]
Smoke these bitches all night long
I got a pint, what you drinking on?
Drop a [?] in a [?]

The niggas these bitches be fightin over
The niggas these bitches be fightin over, yeah
The niggas these bitches be fightin over
In the foreign car with a tight motor

[Chorus] 2x
Wake up and get the the racks
I push my grind to the max
Ain't got no time to relax
Everyday I spend
Gotta get it back

Bitch, I'm just stating the facts
World ain't gon' cut you no slack
Better go find you a sack
Catch me in the motherfucking trap
