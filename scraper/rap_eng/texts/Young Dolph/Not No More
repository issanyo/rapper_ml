[Verse 1]
Grandma put me out the house, found out I'm sellin' dope
Breakin' down bowls, sixteen years old
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
When I was small I prayed to God for a lotta dough
Money callin', I'll see you later I gotta go
I grab my pistol, grab my weed I'm out the door
MY street too hot so I park my car down there by the store
I used to wanna fuck that bitch but not no more
He said that he thought we was boys, yeah we was nigga
Until I realized that you just another fuck nigga
You can't understand me 'cus you ain't from where I'm from
Eatin' ramen noodles with a $30,000 watch on my arm because

[Hook]
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
Flat screens on the wall, money on the floor
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
Bad bitches, good weed everywhere I go
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
But not no more, not no more
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
But not no more, not no more

[Verse 2]
I used to didn't have shit
Didn't have a bed all I had was a mattress
So that's how I turned into a dope-selling bastard
Got tired of livin' like that shit so now I'm livin' lavish
Drop the ticket on it watch that shit move faster
Trap house in the hood collectin' money like a pastor
Sellin' pints of purple in 2004
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
I heard you snitchin', can't answer the phone for you no more
Back in the day I used to want that bitch but not no more
I used to didn't have shit but not no more
But not no more, But not no more

[Hook]
