[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Hustlers, Ballers, Gangsters, Trap-niggas
This one for my I spend all on my sack niggas
I can show you how score and get it back nigga
You ain't no trap nigga than I don’t wanna rap with ya
Nothin but pistols where I lay at like Diddy nigga take that
Nowadays we burning loud, me and Gucci in the Maybach
Nah I don’t think I just state facts
100 million somewhere in my future I can taste that
Nah hold up I erase that, need a whole a billion
Don’t give a fuck if we have to take that

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
II ain't friendly I don’t need you tryna be friendly (you'll offend me)
Don't ask me If I'm wrong bout what I'm spendin' (you'll offend me)
If you see me in don't ask me if its rented (you'll offend me)
All this money I'm making don't need you in my business (you’ll offend me)
You done stepped on a gangsters toes and now I’m mad (now I'm offended)
You done stepped on a gangsters toes and now I’m mad (now I'm offended)
Thought that you was a man you would defend yourself (now I'm offended)
Now you ain't half the man you pretend to be (now I'm offended)

[Verse 2]
When I ride through my hood they think the mayor roll thru
And if I stand on my money I be standin’ 9’2
And i been hurting so long i think my prayers came thru
Now when I roll through the hood its in the 2 door bentley coupe
Louis shoes, louie belt, pants below my waist
Quarter million in jewelry so groupie bitches give me my space
? big as two softballs, diamonds big as golf ball might sack a nigga l
Above the rim like john wall
And I’m a true gangster, thoroughbred hustler
And everywhere I go I rock 5 chains like bust
So watch what you say to me, we ain’t family, my goons spray for me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

Now you ain't half the man you pretend to be (now I'm offended)
