[Chorus]
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
I hit the blunt and I believe that I can fly (yeah yeah)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (yeah yeah)
I mixed the lemon tree with the cherry pie (nigga what?)
I put codeine in a cherry Sprite
She wanna get high and spend the night
Cartiers on, you can't see my eyes
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)

[Verse 1]
You smoking this you's a motherfucking lie
Everyday I got to smoke one ounce of fire (ounce of fire)
Everyday Iâ€˜m in something fast when I ride
Let her hit my blunt she got emotional and she cried
All my niggas lie (lie)
Police call we don't know shit we just be quiet
Come catch me outside
Foreign when I slide
Big cake on my mind
Big cake all the time
If I'm in a car, or some pussy that its mine
She bad she short and thick
Spent a bag on my neck and wrist
I gotta take a piss
I just poured up a six
Riding around with a stick
Riding around with your bitch
4 in the morning she lit

[Chorus]
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
I hit the blunt and I believe that I can fly (yeah yeah)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (yeah yeah)
I mixed the lemon tree with the cherry pie (nigga what?)
I put codeine in a cherry Sprite
She wanna get high and spend the night
Cartiers on, you can't see my eyes
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You wanna blow with the big dog?
You better be pre-pizzard
Concentrates for heavy weights
Nigga don't be skizzared
You say you wanna go but you really don't know whizzere
Hip hop up on my hoorah
And let me take you thizzere
Sunny [?]
Matching [?] so you see what I'm [?]
Laying out them bubble gum cans
When it comes to this shit I'm the man
I supply the Key's, P's, O's. Half's, whole trees
Just place your order that the desk (desk desk desk desk)
And tell them you want the best (best)
Young Dolph, Snoop Dogg yeah we in there
Your backwood, is that good, then put it in air

[Chorus]
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
I hit the blunt and I believe that I can fly (yeah yeah)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (yeah yeah)
I mixed the lemon tree with the cherry pie (nigga what?)
I put codeine in a cherry Sprite
She wanna get high and spend the night
Cartiers on, you can't see my eyes
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Hey Dolph, let's roll my nigga
Them Bitches Wanna go

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3]
Guess who crashed the party
Smoking on some smarties
I look to my left and theres 3 bitches taking molly
They ask me if i'm scared to OD on syrup I say probably
Got so high fucked a cougar bitch cause she had a body
Got so high called a flight left it and got my rarri
She got high jumped on me and rode me like kawasaki
I'm in hollywood at wakanui ordering beef and broccoli
The hustlers say I motivate
The haters say I'm too cocky
Yeah Diamonds cutting up
Gucci button up
Going against me put your money together and huddle up
Pour that codeine in it, watch it bubble up
4 grams of that lemon, roll the blunt

[Chorus]
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
I hit the blunt and I believe that I can fly (yeah yeah)
Let's get high (Let's get high)
Let's get high (yeah yeah)
