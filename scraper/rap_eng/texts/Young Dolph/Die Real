[Intro: Ralo]
Yeah, what you want to be
What you gonna be, I'ma be a real nigga
What you want to be, what you gonna be
What you want to be, I'ma be a real nigga

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Don't ask me what I'ma be, I just want to be real
My mama feel I'ma die 'cause real niggas get killed
That fake shit get revealed, boy you know how that is
I wanna snap on these niggas but some' keep telling me chill
Some' keep telling me never fuck with them people no more
But I love my dog to death and dog it ain't no homo
You gotta pay me for convo, you don't know me I'm John Doe
We gotta fuck in the hood 'cause I don't fuck in the condo
Hold up give me a minute, don't suck that dick 'til I'm finished
It won't hurt to be real, that shit won't cost you a penny
I don't really have any friends, I don't fuck with too many
I only fuck with my soldiers and I'm the sergeant lieutenant, yeah

[Chorus: Ralo]
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
Why they keep on asking me what do I want to be
I just want to take care of my dogs and my family
I just wanna do something niggas ain't never did
I'ma die real if I die broke or I'm rich

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I'ma be a real nigga 'cause that's the easiest thing to do
Been getting money since a youth, what about you?
Diamonds ocean blue, fuck bitches by the twos
They watch my every move, orange Rari, black shoes
Bitch I sold dope because I had to
Gettin' head in the back of the classroom
Told my niggas don't make a move because right now I'm hot
Fuck niggas in they feelings like he can't be stopped
I got money in the wild, blood on my hands
Yeah I love my dogs, yeah I been the man
Yeah I sacrificed everything nigga
Yeah I'm just too real and you a lame nigga

[Chorus: Ralo]
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
Why they keep on asking me what do I want to be
I just want to take care of my dogs and my family
I just wanna do something niggas ain't never did
I'ma die real if I die broke or I'm rich

[Verse 3: Trouble]
All I ever wanted to be in life is what I am
Respect what I demand, stand up nigga I never ran
All I ever wanted to be in life is what I is
Family rules, never put no ho before your kids fool
Family rules, never let no ho fuck up your crib
You got partners down the road, hold 'em down, that's just real
If your plan go sour, take your L, that's what it is
When you told to get out in these streets just like I did fool
Make it out and cop that AMG just like I did
Might just get that Lambo just like Ralo, now they big
Fifteen in my pocket, flex on any given Sunday
Guess it's true, OG said just stay down, you'll get that money

[Chorus: Ralo]
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
What you wanna be? what you wanna be?
What you wanna be? I'ma be a real nigga
Why they keep on asking me what do I want to be
I just want to take care of my dogs and my family
I just wanna do something niggas ain't never did
I'ma die real if I die broke or I'm rich

[Outro: Young Dolph]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
