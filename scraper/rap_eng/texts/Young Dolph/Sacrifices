[Hook]
You see these fast cars, these shiny diamonds
All this shit I got it come from sacrificin'
My family good, and all this cake around me
Everything I got it comes from sacrificin'
Sacrifices, sacrifices
You can't be a boss until you make some sacrifices
Sacrifices, sacrifices
I'm just a dope boy that make good sacrifices

[Verse 1]
I sacrificed my life just to feed my fam
And if I had 2 nigga I'd do it again
I sacrificed these bitches for a hunned band
She asked me can she catch my nut
I said I'll catch you when I can
I call my LA bitch I call you when I land
She move when I say I got her on voice command
Huh, that how I get down, that how I get around
Get messed up too far out of bounce
While I'm somewhere west spending cake out of town

[Bridge]
Done sacrificed the last 10 years of my life
To these streets nigga that's how I got my money right
Ask the streets about me they gonn' tell you it ain't a game
Homie, the most valuable nigga in the game
That's why I keep that thang on me

[Hook]
You see these fast cars, these shiny diamonds
All this shit I got it come from sacrificin'
My family good, and all this cake around me
Everything I got it comes from sacrificin'
Sacrifices, sacrifices
You can't be a boss until you make some sacrifices
Sacrifices, sacrifices
I'm just a dope boy that make good sacrifices

[Verse 2]
I came into this world without a damn thang
Counting 7 at bands, and start a Paper Rap campaign
I'm just a high class, south Memphis dope boy
Hey my nigga close the door, we smoking dope boy
Did all this shit on my own, ain't that dope boy
Only thang I fear is God and I swear I fear going broke boy
All the young niggas, they depend on me
I fucked the shit out of lil mama
She went run her mouth, now her friends want me
I just be laughing at hoes, old ratchet ass hoes
Old maggot ass hoes
A long time ago, I sacrificed all the bitches and bitch niggas
I smoked a blunt them prayed to God
To keep letting my bank account getting bigger

[Hook:]
You see these fast cars, these shiny diamonds
All this shit I got it come from sacrificin'
My family good, and all this cake around me
Everything I got it comes from sacrificin'
Sacrifices, sacrifices
You can't be a boss until you make some sacrifices
Sacrifices, sacrifices
I'm just a dope boy that make good sacrifices
