[Intro]
Buddah Bless this beat

[Chorus]
All of this ice on my neck
You can see that I'm really blessed
Put forty P's in her trunk
Put that little bitch on a test
You can tell just how I dress
That little nigga playing with a check
Little nigga playing with a check
That little nigga playing with a check

[Verse 1]
That money it made me a threat
Send her a text now she got wet
Balling [?]
I get the smoke from the west
Go to New York to get fresh
Flooded the rolex with baguettes
Turned broke to rich thats magic
Smoking kush dipping through traffic
Me and my bitch fucked another bitch
Got rich and got my brother rich
Naw nigga I'm talking real M's
That do what the fuck that I wanna shit
If I can't trust you it's fuck you
Kiss my little girl told her I love you
Hold my little boy told himI love you
Told my bitch I wanna fuck you

[Chorus]
All of this ice on my neck
You can see that I'm really blessed
Put 40 ps in her trunk
Put that little bitch on a test
You can tell just how I dress
That little nigga playing with a check
Little nigga playing with a check
That little nigga playing with a check

[Verse 2]
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Pull up [?]
I don't give a fuck thats my motto
Drop top it came with no [?]
Five naked hoes at the condo
Five naked hoes at the condo
Five naked hoes at the condo
Nigga I wear Gucci like Polo
Stacked up all these M's up dolo
I pull up on you with your hoe
[?]
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Pour up a pint wit my dawgs
And wake up again and do it tomorrow

[Chorus]
All of this ice on my neck
You can see that I'm really blessed
Put 40 ps in her trunk
Put that little bitch on a test
You can tell just how I dress
That little nigga playing with a check
Little nigga playing with a check
That little nigga playing with a check
