[Hook: Dre Murro]
I won’t even ask you where your man at
I just wanna know if I can have that
The way you fit that dress, it got me going
And you with it baby, I’m already knowing
(I’m already knowing!)
I already Know U Know you coming home with me
I already Know U Know ain’t none of this shit for free
I already Know U Know ain’t none of them like me
I’m a youngin’ from the 9INE, I know you wanna fuck with me (Wanna fuck with me!)

[Verse 1: Dre Murro]
I already Know U Know the bands in my pocket
I already Know U Know I’m drenched in Versace
You already know that I don’t care about your man
If he care about his shorty, why he in here with you then?
Just turned 21 and  I been drinkin’ on this Henn’
DJ play my song, they say I’m crazy with the pen
She playing hard to get but imma get it in the end
Imma get it in the car then at the crib, I hit again!
I already Know U Know the way I put it down
I already Know U Know I run the whole town
I been on the come up and you know that
These niggas hating on me and you know that
But I could give a damn, I been the man since the jump
Take your girl and beat it up like Ricky Racks do the trunk
I’m a real Durham nigga, I don’t know no other realer
Know she knowing what I want and I don’t care who came with her, aye!

[Hook: Dre Murro]
I won’t even ask you where your man at
I just wanna know if I can have that

I already Know U Know you coming home with me
I already Know U Know ain’t none of this shit for free
I already Know U Know ain’t none of them like me

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I already know that you already know that
Tonight you my freak hoe so pack your shit and let’s roll!
I might put you in Céline, I might put you in Chanel
In the droptop drinking lean
Selling P’s for the retail (yeah!)
If you got a nigga, let me know girl I won’t tell
One whole hour from the back, I’m like nobody else
I asked her where’s her friend, she told me she don’t like to share
She said she ain’t sharing shit, she want it all for herself (Ugh!)
She told me put my hands around her neck and pull her hair
I told her I got a bitch, she said so what she don’t care
Lil mama a savage, she said I can have it
I had a lot of bad ones but she one of the baddest (Aye!)
She just wanna have a good time & lay up and smoke
She pull up, get right to it and massage me with her throat
I already know that she already know that
I’m all about my dough and every day I’m chasing more! Aye!

[Hook: Dre Murro]
I won’t even ask you where your man at

The way you fit that dress, it got me going
And you with it baby, I’m already knowing

I already Know U Know you coming home with me
I already Know U Know ain’t none of this shit for free
I already Know U Know ain’t none of them like me

[Outro: Dre Murro & Young Dolph]
