I got peas in the house, coupe in the front yard
Nosey ass old lady next door, she lookin' hard
Stuffin' trees in the zip-loc, cuz im over there whippin' hard
Weighin' peas on the scale while I'm taking phone calls

Drop it on the scale!(x8)

[Verse 1]
Get a pack in, shit I might as well
Kill for my niggas, shit fuck yeah
Be a betterman i'll show you how to be a player
We don't count that money no mo', we drop it on the scale
One day we gone be rich, thats what I told my boy LaTrel
Nowadays I fuck bad bitches at big boy hotels
Before this rap shit, I was always everywhere
Fuck this music, I can make a million off a scale
They comin' in and goin out, got yo bitch takin' shots ass naked, showin' out
In my spot countin' paper, nigga thats that paper route
I'm the-i'm the Go and meet, So what the fuck the hatin' bout

[Verse 2]
What's that fuckin' smell(LOUD), Roll it up nigga, then I put it in the air
Nigga act like you know I got this shit for sale
What the fuck you mean my nigga, you can look at me and tell, you can look at me nd tell
Give a fuck about a nigga, Give a fuck about a bitch
You know what up with me my nig, im on that castalia shit
Since I started this shit, dogg I been the CEO
But you damn right, Hell yea I fuck with Daddy-O

Got a stupid ass toy, and that bitch hold a hunna
JUST LIKE MY TOY, FUCK NIGGA I'm A HUNNA!!!!
