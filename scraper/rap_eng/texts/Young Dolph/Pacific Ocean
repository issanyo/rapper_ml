[Chorus]
Twenty thousand square feet house by the water (water)
Water (water), water (water), water, hah, yeah
Nah bitch I can't swim but bitch my neck full of water (water)
Water (water), water (wet), hah, ayy
Keep it real with the plug and get rich or should I rob him?
Rob him, get rich, rob him, get rich, rob him
Damn you fell in love with that bitch, I fell in love with my chopper
(chopper), chopper (chopper), chopper (chopper), hah

[Verse 1]
I get your whole family whacked if I thought you was a problem
Problem, problem, okay
My next door neighbor some nigga in the NBA
I pulled up in that thing, you should've seen they face
Multimillionaire, get you smoked then buy the case
Hold up hold up hold up, call you when I leave the bank
Shit, lil mama thick I mean lil mama lit
Maybach on my wrist
Dolph who your stylist? you fresh as a bitch
Hit a lick, ballin' ever since
Trust a bitch, I'll leave that for you tricks
Tricks is for kids, yeah yeah
I hate the pigs, yeah yeah
I'm eating like Diddy, yeah yeah
'Cause I did it big, yeah yeah
Put ice on my bitch
I put ice on my kids
Keep ice in my cup
And I keep me something to sip

[Chorus]
Twenty thousand square feet house by the water (water)
Water (water), water (water), water, hah, yeah
Nah bitch I can't swim but bitch my neck full of water (water)
Water (water), water (wet), hah, ayy
Keep it real with the plug and get rich or should I rob him?
Rob him, get rich, rob him, get rich, rob him
Damn you fell in love with that bitch, I fell in love with my chopper
(chopper), chopper (chopper), chopper (chopper), hah

[Verse 2]
Grew up bumping Dwayne but turned to a boss like Sean Carter
Carter, Carter, Carter (Trap-A-Fella, bitch)
Lil bitch on my dick, she says she want a star
Lil nigga signed his life away for Jordans and a car
Told my grandma what I'm worth and she said oh my god
He said he used to have that work, we don't believe you boy
Fuck niggas give me the giggles
Tom Ford robe, matching Gucci slippers
Give your stupid ass the camera, you still wouldn't get the picture
Hah, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I hate fake love, I hate fake love, I hate fake love, yeah
I just wanna fuck, I just wanna fuck, I don't make love
Go to the strip club, throw up a dub, bitch we on drugs
Versace vase, Versace mirror, Versace rugs

[Chorus]
Twenty thousand square feet house by the water (water)
Water (water), water (water), water, hah, yeah
Nah bitch I can't swim but bitch my neck full of water (water)
Water (water), water (wet), hah, ayy
Keep it real with the plug and get rich or should I rob him?
Rob him, get rich, rob him, get rich, rob him
Damn you fell in love with that bitch, I fell in love with my chopper
(chopper), chopper (chopper), chopper (chopper), hah
