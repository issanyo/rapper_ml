[Verse 1]
In a fish in the crack while I'm getting high
My niggas sold me some cookies, that shit super fowl
Chase it with some screw juice, now I'm gonna get super tired
My nigga, that shit you smoking super quiet
Hell no, there ain't no loud, nigga use a line
Least the Fendy with the YSL, super fly
I'm multimillion pound of swag, I see you lil guys
When my whole click pull up in the Bentleys don't be surprised
I'm 'bout to take these diamonds off and go gold shopping
I was shoppin with my connect when y'all was hoe shopping
Gone to duty, friend it's time for war, Kemo Sabe
Don't give a fuck bout shit I go to war with anybody

[Chorus]
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
Tried to look for a real bitch
But all of 'em the same, though
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
Tried to look for some real niggas
But all of 'em the same, though

[Verse 2]
Bitch you asked your man, you gots to be crazy
You know fucking wel it ain't my damn baby (bitch, please)
These hoes thirsty and these niggas shady
Streets turned my heart cold, straight vacant
Empty, ain't nothing else in it
I just come to count this money and I ain't got no feelings
My hoe say I never come to my plug, say that I'm worse
If you ain't talking about money then my phone ain't got no service
If your convo ain't bowed down in Sunday, my phone ain't working, no
I fucked her but I don't remember her name, though
I change these bitches faster than I change clothes
Look you already know a bag of money where I came from

[Chorus]
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
Tried to look for a real bitch
But all of 'em the same, though
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
I just came to get what I came for
Tried to look for some real niggas
But all of 'em the same, though
