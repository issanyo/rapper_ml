[Hook x2: Young Dolph]
This shit run thru my blood
I say this shit run thru my blood
Yeah, this shit run thru my blood
Lil' hoes this shit run thru my blood

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Take you back to year 01', sittin' in my apartments
Hundred thousand dollar appetite, I was starvin'
Half my partners dealin', the other half was robbin'
One thing they had in common, they always catchin' charges
Had my mind made, always get money regardless
And fuck goin' to jail, long as I'm clockin' dollars
Word got around, Lil Dolph he got that good
Niggas wanna shop but scared to come to my hood
Niggas act like pussies so I started makin' deliveries
All in North Memphis servin' with that forty-fifth on me
Fuck all my enemies, pussies don't know my struggle
I started sellin' dope to take care of my lil' brother

[Hook x2: Young Dolph]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Never sold soft, I never touched the hard
But word through the city, this young nigga go hard
My grandma found out I was slangin' and it broke her heart
She caught me red handed sackin' up in the backyard
I turned around, you right there, I didn't know what to say
Worst day of my life seein' them tears come down your face
She said "you gon' be just like your daddy, and your Uncle Vick"
"They was doin' the same shit back in '76"
Woah, that shit fucked me up
From what my grandmomma told me - this shit run in my blood
I had to give y'all the story because it's past due
I didn't do it cuz I want to, but because I had to

[Hook x2: Young Dolph]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
So much strong in here the fumes make you nauseous
Been runnin' the streets so long that I'm exhausted
Hooked up with my big dog and got on that boss shit
Now a days the whole city on that Dolph shit
Turned a bale of loud to a motherfuckin' coop
Turned a trap house to a motherfuckin' rap booth
Told my plug this my last time, and I'm through
He said "I don't blame you young nigga, you the truth"
Now me and my nigga DJ Squeeky makin' history
And I'm shittin' on these rap niggas cuz they ain't shit to me
Turned my clientele to a fuckin' empire
Wait lemme smoke to this, where's my lighter?
