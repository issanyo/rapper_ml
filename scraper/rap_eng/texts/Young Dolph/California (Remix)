[Intro: T.I.]
Mr. Hanky
Bankroll Mob
Okay okay
You know, you know
Well I be

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Bumping California Love on the West Side
Thanking God for the weed, women, and the sunshine
Dumb hot
Out on Sunset
Blowing kush
From the one time
You get a contact
Catch ya ass at the red light
Wanna run at 'em sideways in a Hellcat
On some run flat
By the way I
Never seen a better view, not in Malibu
Bunch of bad bitches naked in the swimming pool
Hear the waves crashing, playing spades in the living room (Cracking)
Sound like a Doggystyle interlude
Kurupt Gotti, nigga where the gas at?
Moon rock got me acting like I never had shit
From Bankhead to a Hollywood address
Same nigga tho
One on one get your ass kicked
Respect it more than a tad bit
Every hood every set though
Sheesh!
One time for the West Coast
LA, the Bay, from Sacramento out to San Diego, California

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Palm trees in the air, the top pushed back
Blowing smoke out the roof cookies to be exact
I'm always in Cali cause this is where it's at
Bitches, bud, good weather, what you know 'bout that
Where all the fly bitches ride Benzs and Beamers
They either wanna be an actress, or a singer
I'm at the strip club on Sunset, throwing singles
With this bad bitch from Compton, pouring lean up
Breaking down backwoods, rolling gasoline up
Left the Laugh Factory, pulled up in Inglewood
I fuck with some crips and I fuck with some bloods
And I fuck with some es√©
My stash house in the Valley
Welcome to my palace
Just went and killed two shows out in Dallas
Selling OG from LA and crates from the Bay

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 3: Colonel Loud]
You know I gotta show the West love
I had to take a trip to Cali for the best bud
I been chilling with the goons, yeah the real thugs
Went to Sacramento nigga met a real plug
I said I'm looking for the gas where the kill at
Want the strong gotta go where the hill at
I met a bad bopper chilling out in Frisco
Like to sip the lime-a-ritas and the sisco
I hopped my ass on the 101 and headed north
And when I hit the hill I found what I was looking for
I'm feeling like a leprechaun with a pot of gold
Bags of the gas yeah the Colonel got a soul
I fly a bitch from the A with 100 racks
Put her ass in a rental told her run it back
Fly another bitch in with 200 more
Welcome to California the State of gold

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 4: Ricco Barrino]
Somebody fly me out to 'Frisco
Oakland, San Jose, or Vallejo
Shout out to EPA, Sacramento
Where they keep a nigga laced with all the good smoke
I wanna fly out to LA
Meet a bad little honey with a pretty face
I wanna slide out to Inglewood
Long Beach where it feels good
Compton where the hell you at
Show me love we be looking for the loud packs
Shout out to South Central, shout out to Watts
Where the killers always got my back
I wanna chill out in Fresno (Stockton)
I wanna go to San Diego

[Outro]
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali
