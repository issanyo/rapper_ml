[Intro]

[Pre-Hook: Cap 1]
I don’t trust these bitches
I don’t trust these niggas
I just broke the money counter
I say my nigga we getting it

[Hook: Cap 1]
Fuck you doing? .. I’m juggin nigga
Fuck you doing? .. I’m juggin nigga
Fuck you doing? .. I’m juggin nigga
In the kitchen let me cook it with you

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Running through all these twenties I done broke the money counter
Your bitch pussy so wet boy I call that bitch water fountain
I been juggin’. I been counting. I been trapping like a bitch
Tell [?]
I got pounds in the dresser and I got PTs in the fridge
Hell no I don’t eat pork cause I don’t get along with pigs
Fuck these niggas. Fuck these bitches
Cause these niggas they act like bitches
And these bitches they ain’t shit
I get em high feed em dick
Damn right you can’t tell me nothing
Yeah I think I’m the shit
Remember I came home sixteen years old
Grandma said, “you selling that shit”
Couldn’t do nothing but look down
She smack me, she put me out
I had to trap it out and went got me a spot out in Canyon

[Verse 2: Cap 1]
Fuck you doing? .. I’m juggin nigga
Just cut the tape so I can see the picture
Blowing on that strong weed we just smoked an extension
Money counter broke just ran through all these fifties
Baking soda odors in my new Givenchy
Snake skin Giuseppe’s just sent me 1260
Red bitch with me, she look picture perfect
Nigga want a half of bird I sent my bitch to serve him
Powder stuffed all in my pocket
Got guns and dope all on the counter
In the kitchen going crazy nigga trying to whip up a Phantom
Got lean in my Phantom
Run through these streets of Atlanta
Picking up a check fucking niggas bitches got your ho dancing on camera
