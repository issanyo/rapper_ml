[Intro]
Yeah, I'm bout to pull up
Yeah

[Chorus]
Pull up in a space ship like I'm in space Jam (skrt)
I just put 400 pounds on a gray hound (hey come here)
Fuck her from the back and made lil mama lay it down (a huh)
Damn (damn)
Damn (damn)
Black Trans-Am

[Verse 1]
Hey whats that? Blunt behind my ear
Love counting these mill's (millions)
All my roster clear (water)
Horses in my whip (fast)
That nigga too real (damn)
Playa of the year (damn)
Hustling ass nigga
God blessed me with a gift (trap)
I take your contract and wipe my ass with your record deal (ha)
She got a fat ass I might leave a fat tip (yeah)
You can have whatever you like bitch I feel like tip (it's dolph)
I come through shining hard let a lil' nigga live
When I was a kid I used to watch MTV cribs (yeah)
Now I'm smoking kush sitting in my MTV Crib (yeah)
Put that dick in her she say she feel in in her ribs
Getting head in my office like I'm president Bill

[Chorus]
Pull up in a space ship like I'm in space Jam (skrt)
I just put 400 pounds on a gray hound (hey come here)
Fucked her the back and made lil mama lay it down (a huh)

Fell in love with the trenches
But it didn't love me back
Fell in love with them bitches
And them didn't love you back (what)
At least I still got paid (for real)
Them hoes I don't save
Screaming "free all my niggas"
Praying for better days (a huh)
Counting half a million same clothes three days (woo)
