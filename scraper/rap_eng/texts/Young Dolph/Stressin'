[Intro]
Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

[Verse 1]
Give us this day our daily bread
Just Watch over my family Lord while I'm out here chasing bread
It's like I always get bad news everyday I jump out the bed
So I roll a fat one up and I take one to the head
Momma call us and my auntie just found out she got cancer
Could do nothing but hold my head down ain't even know how to answer
Hung the phone up called my auntie told she gone be 'aight
Don't know [?] but for family I put that shit on my [?]
Yeah, I sold dope just for family could live good
No matter how far I get for South Memphis I'm still hood
Auntie just call me said she felt low can't you send some pictures?
Wherever you go through auntie just know we're right here with you

[Hook]
Our Father, who art in heaven
Yeah I'm doing good but I be stressin'
Didn't come to ask for no money but I be streesin'
Come for my niggas locked up they got their family stressin'
Our Father, who art in heaven
Didn't come to ask for no money but I be stressin'
Yeah I'm doing good but I be stressin'
Come for my niggas locked up they got their family stressin'

[Verse 2]
I got this niggas that's so close to me
That he [?] me so I treated him like blood
Shit crazy nigga stole from me
It's all good my nigga I ain't trippin' bruh you still [?]
But hell nah I can't fuck with you
Hell nah Ion' trust you nigga
Your crazy pal still love you nigga
But I would never gave you none nigga
A OG once told me
That you got all the love in the world
But the streets never loved you nigga
For real, damn, this shit cray
The way I roll the weed all day
Tryna smoke my palms away
That's why I gotta get rich right now
Get this shit outta the way
All I can do in effort forgiveness of my sins
And pray for better places

[Hook]
