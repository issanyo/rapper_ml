[Verse 1]
3 grams stuffed in a zig zag
33 grand stuffed in my bitch's bag
We gettin' big money, so I'm buying big bags
Extra bad, never had class
Too much ass couldn't wrap pass
Got her breaking down weed on the iPad
1st grade told her I'mma a fool with it
She said "It's all good", she know what to do with it
She know we gettin' dirty money, and she cool with it
Sold her new shit, new city
She said "Thank you" I said welcome to Dolph world
Where you might wanna call me and get lost, girl
She like to cook and she roll weed good
Might make her 1st lady next to Kisha
Stay trap nigga, no visa
Everytime we fuck I put it in the sleeper

[Hook]
Waking up, I'mma always be around
[?]
I'm your first lady
When you know I'm driving you crazy
[?]
And when you know I'm gonna alter your baby
I'm your first lady
I'm your first lady

[Verse 2]
Week 2, verse 2
Fuck with her
I got her in a hottub, smoking [?]
She say she ain't want shit, she just want time
But I'm a streetnigga, so I gotta get mine
But believe when im free, I'lll make time
When we get together, its playtime
She wanna give me facetime
She some special, flyer than a feather
2-seater, leather
Shorty in the passenger seat
Good girl, [?], we just happen to met
Told her when we met, it was my real life
You might get addicted, better think twice

[Verse 3]
She text me and ask, can i come over now
Yeah that's my first lady, 'cause she holding me down
Glasses of champagne when we rollin' round
Overseas swag, global sound

[Hook]
Waking up, I'mma always be around
[?]
I'm your first lady
When you know I'm driving you crazy
[?]
And when you know I'm gonna alter your baby
I'm your first lady
I'm your first lady
