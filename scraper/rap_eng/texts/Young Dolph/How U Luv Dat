[Intro]
Honorable C.N.O.T.E

[Verse 1]
Rockstar, but I don't ride no motherfuckin’ bike
I get too high for that shit so I can't play with my life (hey!)
Caked up, so I buy whatever I think I like (yeah)
I said I was done buying ice, nigga sike (sike!)
Parked the Rari at the crib and came back in a Bentley (what up?)
Codiene what I'm sippin’
Gelato I'm twistin'
Got on too much ice, hard for the bitch to pay attention
Menace just like Dennis
I got racks like Venus
I put Yves Saint Laurent on my bitches
Bought my lil South Memphis bitch some titties
Nothin' but mula when I talk in every sentence
Nigga I treat a Demon like a Hemi

[Chorus]
Unlimited racks, bitch how you love that?
Smokin' kush in the back of the Maybach
How you love that, bitch how you love that?
Unlimited racks bitch, how you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
Unlimited racks bitch, how you love that?

[Verse 2]
Unlimited racks
Unlimited racks
I just got some sloppy from your girl then sent her back
Smash her from the back, then put her out like Janet Jackson
On the top floor of the Trump Towers, music blastin'
Naw I can't fuck with suckers right now because I'm fastenin’
Big shit poppin, yeah nigga I been having it
Yeah I got more guap than all my opps put together
Blue ice on me, in my jumper like I’m a Blue Devil
Fuck it this fall I'ma go enroll in Duke
Every Friday, smoke 2 pounds with the students
How it feel when every time you kiss your baby mom?
Boy you kissin’ my dick, you know how she use her tongue

[Chorus]
Unlimited racks, bitch how you love that?
Smokin' kush in the back of the Maybach
How you love that, bitch how you love that?
Unlimited racks bitch, how you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
How you love that, bitch? How you love that?
Unlimited racks bitch, how you love that?
