[Verse 1: Aoc Obama]
Wake up on Instagram
She all on Snapchat
She gained a couple pounds
She bought the snapback
Her booking info
All in her bio
And if your money right my nigga she might try you
Wearin’ that see-through shit
She know she hurtin’ something
All in the mirror bustin’ moves like Mrs. Twerk Summ
Hundred K followers, okay bitch wow
The bitch bought a Rollie now she think she cashed out
Told her shout out my album, she brushed me off quick
But posting pictures with that flat tummy tan shit
She all on private islands, taking exotic trips
But I bet she won’t tag the nigga that she with

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
My bitch Instagram famous

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I swear these bitches do the most just for Instagram
Swear she from Atlanta but that bitch from Birmingham
Her favorite phone app is the Snapchat cam
Celine bags, a hundred thousand followers, goddamn
She went and bought a fatter ass ‘cause she want more likes
But the only thing she get from me is more pipe
She got a Benz and her license plate say snow white
She the DM me like see you at the show type
Memorial Day, she down in Miami or Vegas
And posting every other hour, bitch this for my haters
She on the hunt for the rappers and the ball players
But me, I’m a trapper with that ball paper

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
My bitch Instagram famous
My bitch she Instagram famous
She let social media go to her head
My bitch Instagram famous
My bitch she Instagram famous
She let social media go to her head

[Verse 3: Aoc Obama]
I’m in the SL lounge, she on bruh’s dick
And now she thinkin’ she Nicki ‘cause Meek Mill liked her pic
She ain’t no fake bitch but she got fake tits
All in the Shade Room Baller Alert comments
And she turn every fucking thing into a photoshoot
And she can’t wait for the rain, Chanel rain boots
She poppin’ bottles in them ballplayers’ sections
And screenshotting every time a rapper texts her
She like dog niggas, she love that dog filter
I can’t wait ‘til I get home and put this dog in her
And every time she get mad she unfollow a nigga
But answer every time I call and come swallow a nigga

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
