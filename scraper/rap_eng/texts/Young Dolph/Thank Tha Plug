[Hook: Quavo]
Got a hundred pounds moving on the road
Which way they gon' go?
I can tell nobody 'bout the plug
I can't let'em find out bout the plug
Rollie wrapped around my wrist,  I gotta thank the plug
Made a million in the trap, I gotta thank the plug
No more pots and pans
I'm in a mansion I gotta thank the plug
Got hoes in the kitchen dirty dancin' gotta thank the plug

[Verse 1: Quavo]
The first thing the plug told me
You handlin' your business you living like Kobe
I know that you got some young soldiers
You gotta how to control 'em
I roll up the blunt and sit back and told  'em
Imma young nigga got white in the hood like I'm Odom
The plug sit back and he laugh
You need 50 pounds of good gas
Act like a nigga can't do nothing wit 'it
I pulled out nothing but a whole nother 50
And I touch down on the North
Fuck up the city Migos and Young Dolph
I got the buns no Tony Hawk
I'm thanking the plug for them new Giuseppe walkers

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Got a 100 on the road, 50 in the air
Fifty in the clip, quartel milli trill
Half OG, half cookies I don't fuck with pussies
Migos, Young Dolph that's a loota loots
Raw sushi, drop a 40 pack off in the hood, watch that benji go stupid
Fuck you totin' a pistol for, nigga if you ain't gon' shoot
Jump off the plane greet my plug with a high five
Young nigga dopeboy (mobtown)

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Made a hundred mill deal M, in the bando
Gotta thank the plug
Two cup full of mud
Muddy trouble while we pourin' up
Youha ful of bricks, plus a motherfucking truck load
The truck backing up in reverse mode
This bitch said Takeoff why the mud
What you mean bitch I'm on drugs
Chopping with accuracy, breaking them bricks and I'm bagging it
All of these pints look like I'm sponsored by Actavis
Empty any clips for my enemies
Ashin' on my Christian Louboutins
Two Bentley's pull up me and Dolph South Memphis
We trappin' in vintage Givenchy
