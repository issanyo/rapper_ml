[Hook: Gucci Mane]
King Pins need kilos, junkies they need brilo
Brick squad cool, otherside of the pillow
Nah I can't fold, money longer than limo
Ice game cold they know we sub zero
Ask your baby bro he say I'm his hero
Fat bankroll you think we play Cee Lo

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My mama can't prepare me man it's unpreparable
Cross brick squad my nigga is unrepairable
Gucci Flocka bloodline thick we inseparable
And I don't give a damn you broke cause I ain't helping you
Knock up will amaze you shoes damn special bro
Better go and buy you a douce skirt skirt your extras up
Who's that at my door oh that's a regular
Hey won't remember the sound but what I'm ballin' for
Gangster crossover quick, Jamal Crawford ya

In Vegas I keep throwin 3 4's I herschel walker ya
And Gucci keep the hammer with him like he a carpenter

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Waka Flocka]

You can look and me and tell 'em all about a check
My ATL nigga college my nigga call it juggin my nigga we callin call it
That loud shit gottem' beatin down my traphouse early in the morning

Drinking codeine while I'm selling this p's

Get you a pack, get it gone the same day
For a clam nigga don't get delay
We living sipping on ace of spadess
