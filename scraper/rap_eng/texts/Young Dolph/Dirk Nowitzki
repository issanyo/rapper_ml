[Hook: Quavo]
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
(Actavis!)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
41 shots, Dirk Nowitzki
Whole bunch of chickens in the ceiling
All my rich hood niggas feel me
Pull out banana, get to peeling
15 Vince Carter on the wing
17 five for a wing
Every time my fucking phone ring
Asians in China speak Chinese
Bad bitches in the VIP please
Hundred racks on my chain sneeze
I'm sick, 40 thousand rich
Quavo took your bitch
Sliding in that six

[Hook: Quavo]
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Trapping out a mansion, choppers in the bando
Smoking strong, doing donuts in that Lambo
11th grade in the lunch line with a bankroll
I fucked your bitch from the back without my chains on
And my shades on
Then I sent her home
Cartier frames match the presidential Rollie
I drink promethazine because it taste good with what I'm smoking
I told your bitch take off her shoes 'fore she jumps in my car
Getting head, counting money that's my favorite part
A million dollars worth of cars in the front yard
I keep real niggas with me everywhere I go
20 foreigns back to back in a row

[Hook: Quavo]
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
It's nothing but getting money niggas with me
Nothing but getting money niggas with me
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
Sipping on Texas, Dirk Nowitzki
