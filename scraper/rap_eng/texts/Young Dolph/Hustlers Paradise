[Verse 1]
You might just pull up on me bumpin' Marilyn Manson
Got me the killa head and the advantage
2 stepping in the club, diamonds dancing
I gave the bitch the wrong number and she called me fancy
Remember ballin' and sleek counting money every night
Lost 20 stacks with 2 dollar pair of dice
On the elevator going up with a pair of dikes
Welcome to the life we live, hustlers paradise
Where everything fuck 20 we shut like everyday christmas 2010
[?] along they say I spent 50 racks on dilla
Speeded through the streets, plotting on the 100 mil
Now only way we don't get it, is if I get killed

[Hook]
Fast cars, blue lights, street lights
[?] 60, burning kush and running street lights
Crazy world we living in, hustler's paradise
Where everybody doing wrong to live a better life
Hustlers Paradise, hustlers paradise
Where everybody doing wrong to live a better life
Hustlers Paradise, hustlers paradise

[Verse 2]
I was born and raised in hustler paradise
I was born and raised in hustler paradise
Out running the streets so my mom could live a better life
Lil momma asked me cause she called me and I said maybe
Bitch do you got a job and how much do you make
These [?] platinum star 80
It's hard to ball in these streets, these niggas [?]
These young niggas love me, guess I am a role model
They say I ball with Sway, so I'm like a [?]
Mistress got me taking Colorado trips
Syrah for the pink and Moscato for my bitch
Welcome to the life we living, hustlers paradise
[?] shit no matter what the weather like

[Hook]
Fast cars, blue lights, street lights
[?] 60, burning kush and running street lights
Crazy world we living in, hustler's paradise
Where everybody doing wrong to live a better life
Hustlers Paradise, hustlers paradise
Where everybody doing wrong to live a better life
Hustlers Paradise, hustlers paradise
