Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
She said she got it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Turn around
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Oh y’all say y’all getting money
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I'm smoking big Backwoods like I’m Mac Dre
Malcolm X always made me want a AK
Gave the mailman a high five and told him a great day
Oh you ain’t hit her yet? I fucked her on the first date
Yeah she yo girl but I fucked her on her birthday
She just like my style and she love my wordplay
What type of question is that "Am I going to work today?"
Thats like asking if I’m gonna drink syrup today (po-up)
Paid 15k just to get the car sprayed
3 pints of act, a pound cookies, I’ll be up for days
Day dreamin’ bout 100 mill caught myself in a daze
Blazin’ OG I don’t smoke no fuckin’ purple haze

[Hook]
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
She said she got it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Turn around
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Oh y’all say y’all getting money
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
It's Sunday night I'm down in Dallas pulling up at Onyx
I'm known for spending a lot of money, smokin' a lot of chronic
Next stop Charlotte, yeah I'm on the way to Cameo
Got a couple bad bitches in there but they ratchet though
Trap nigga but all I rock nigga is high end fashion though
Caught a flight to LA, tonight we at A-O-D
Tomorrow we back down south, Miami K-O-D
All those niggas in the club but they say they want me
Got off the plane in Atlanta, pulled up on my boy 2 Chainz
Fuck it it's Tuesday we might as well pull up at Blue Flame
She asked me where I’m from, I said "Lil bitch I’m an alien"
Smoking Jupiter OG, DC and Stadium

Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
She said she got it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Turn around
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Oh y’all say y’all getting money
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
