[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'ma keep a bad bitch no matter what
I'ma stay caked up no matter what
Some of these niggas just fake as fuck no matter what
Yeah I'ma flex, I'ma stunt no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep it real with my dogs no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep sitting on these niggas no matter what

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Ay, I'ma stay fresh as fuck, caked up
Thumbing through the check just like a paper cut no matter what
Trap nigga got a bad girl with a fat ass and I'ma buy whatever she want no matter what
I'ma keep it real with my dogs, dressed up in all black and prepare to kill with my dogs
The type to do it by myself and split a meal with my dogs
Pussy hating on me but his bitch love my dirty drop
Put my bitch in a foreign and got me another Rollie
Iced out, paper wrap piece and that bitch fully loaded
Sneakers by Margiela, matching Burberry sweater
Any master Coupe, I kill him how I put this shit together

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'ma keep a bad bitch no matter what
I'ma stay caked up no matter what
Some of these niggas just fake as fuck no matter what
Yeah I'ma flex, I'ma stunt no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep it real with my dogs no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep sitting on these niggas no matter what

[Verse 2: T.I.]
No matter what I found never do another damn thang, I'ma ball
50k spent at the mall, riding here, can you hear the exhaust?
All I know is a bankroll, and had a couple menage with a stank hoe
Then any bitch know if you know me
It take more than two, wanna tango? Dig it
Play your position and mind your business
I'm tryna put commas beside of your digit
This bitch in my car, she don't need a bra
That bitch with you, she should go hide your titty
In your crib, man, how you gon' get it?
With a bunch of bad bitches, I said, how you gon' hit it?
And I'm soo silly, said to eat her, you are not gon' get it
Come to be an hour later ridin' out in it
And in my 96 Impala with some broads off in it
Get topped off it gettin' [?] get dropped off in it
From trapping to rapping to fashion to acting [?] now add it up
I know fuck nigga mad enough, but we keep ballin' and flossin' no matter what

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'ma keep a bad bitch no matter what
I'ma stay caked up no matter what
Some of these niggas just fake as fuck no matter what
Yeah I'ma flex, I'ma stunt no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep it real with my dogs no matter what
No matter what, no matter what
I'ma keep sitting on these niggas no matter what
