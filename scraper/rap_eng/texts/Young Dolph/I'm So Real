[Chorus]
I'm so real (I'm so real)
You so fake (you so fake)
See straight through you (see straight through you)
You a snake (you a snake)
If I don't get paid, then I can't participate (hell naw)
Yesterday I fucked my bitch on the lake (on the lake)

See straight through you (see straight through you)
You a snake (you a snake)
If I don't get paid, then I can't participate (hell naw)

[Verse 1]
My bitch looked at me and said, "Nigga you too real" (thank you, babe)
"Why you drink so much codeine?" Bitch, because I'm ill (ill)
Thirty-thousand in Neiman Marcus, I dress to kill (swag)
She suck that thang so good, I had to tell that girl to yield (hey, slow down)
I do what I wanna so I only chase commas (M's)
I do what I wanna so I smoke too much marijuana (yeah)
Three bitches, one me, it's a royal rumble (oh)
Money don't mean shit to me, so that's why I'm so humble (so humble)
I mean that's why I'm so real, thirty days boy (real)
I just made a whole mill (yeah, yeah)
Go get you some real money, wash everybody's change (it's crazy)
Go look in the mirror, nigga, I ain't got shit to explain (ayy)

[Chorus]
I'm so real (I'm so real)
You so fake (you so fake)
See straight through you (see straight through you)
You a snake (you a snake)

See straight through you (see straight through you)
You a snake (you a snake)
If I don't get paid, then I can't participate (hell naw)
Yesterday I fucked my bitch on the lake (on the lake)

[Verse 2]
(Hey, what up?)
I see straight through you (I see straight through you)
I'm cow manure (I'm the shit)
She too drunk to drive, called that bitch a Uber (ayy, call that bitch a ride)
You need to fire them and hire some more shooters (shooters)
If you ain't realized it yet, you a loser (capital L)
Two-toned patty with the big boogers (icy)
Rich niggas still runnin' 'round them hoodlums (yeah)
Damn that boy is shinin' (yeah), she look at their face (what time is it?)
Damn, it's perfect timin' (yeah)
Just had another baby (hey, hey, hey)
Waitin' on me to give him somethin', he can keep waitin' (I swear)
On me to turn into a fake nigga, you can keep waitin' (waitin')
I'm too real (I'm too real), what's the deal? (You too fake)
Fuck your deal (hahaha, yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm so real (I'm so real)
You so fake (you so fake)
See straight through you (see straight through you)
