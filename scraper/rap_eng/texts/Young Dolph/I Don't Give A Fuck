[Hook: Young Dolph]
Spend a hundred on a coupe, nigga, I don't give a fuck
Two bands on a perc, Christian Louboutin
She nigga hating on me, but I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, nah
I don't give a fuck
High class nigga, all I smoke is A plus
Might blow a whole P, nigga, I don't give a fuck
Girl on my lap, she say she wanna fuck
She say she wanna fuck, she say she wanna fuck
Poor nigga ain't nothing but I don't give a fuck
Them niggas talk pistols, but they ain't going bust
I bust the whole thing, and I don't gonna give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, nah, I don't give a fuck
If it ain't about money, nah, I don't give a fuck
In other words you can shut the fuck up
She say money, hold up, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, nah, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I'm money hungry, I'm greedy
I'm selfish, I'm hardheaded
I'm young and dumb
But guess what, I don't give a fuck
And these young niggas that you see me with
In your city whenever I come
They with the shit, and nah bitch, they don't give a fuck
Got money by the front of the hood, so I don't give a fuck
Pull a drive by in a coupe, and wet a nigga up
She said she never met a nigga fresh as me bruh
Told the come here, sit here next to me girl
These niggas be flexin', these niggas be loud'
These niggas be stuntin', these niggas be flossin'
This watch on my arm, cost more than your motherfucking Charger
I know them niggas hating but I don't give a fuck
It ain't my fault that they can't keep up
Your bitch just text me, said she want to fuck
Your bitch kinda thick, but she ugly as fuck
Old ass nigga in my hood hating, but he know what up
But ima keep on coming through stuntin'
'cause I don't give a fuck, nah, I don't give a fuck
