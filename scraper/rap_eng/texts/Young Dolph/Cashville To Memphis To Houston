[Chorus-Lito]
Where the money come fast, but the love don't last
Fuckin right, had to get it on my own
No I wasn't gon ask, lookin back I come fuckin up a sack
Said fuckin ima stack, looked up got another hundred racks, (Damn) Got another hundred rack
(Yeah)

[Verse 1- Young Dolph]
Yeah, that money come fast (forreal), and that hate come ever faster
But I tell em I don't give fuck, cause my coupe go even faster
I'm in the hood with the trappers, never thought I would be a rapper (Nah)
Take chances cause I love to gamble, young nigga burnin money like a candle
Aye gotta whole lot of money, lost a whole lot of friends (shit crazy)
Got a whole lot of whips, and a whole lot of ice
Wish I could give all this shit up, to bring my grandma back to life
R.I.P
My nigga, I'm just living my life, somebody pass me the light (Smoke one)

[Verse 2-Starlito]
They gon have to catch me tonight
I'm on one, and got one on me
Where I'm from homie, it was squeeze on sight
We don't fight, drink so dark and weed so light
Need 3 more sprites (Damn)
Took a lot of chances to grind it hard (Killa=-check 1,2 what it do)
That's why Lito ice, like casino lights yeah

[Verse 3-Killa Kyleon]
I done seen it all, like these 80 inches mobbing on my wall (yeah)
When the money goes, watch the bitches play with other niggas getting when you rise, and fall
Used to pray to God, hoping that I would ball (Swish)
Just to fuck it off in Galleria mall
Now flooded rollies, kilo, Cuban links, multi colored couches think I'm Biggie Smalls (baby, baby)
Watcha know about a hundred pints, a hundred pounds of smoke
I got wall to wall
IPhone steady going dead, where my charger at, I got too many calls (what it do siri)
Money over bitches
Mother fuck a pig, cause I hate bacon (Lito-ahhh) and the fuckin law

[Verse 4-Starlito]
And I hate waitin on patience at all
It's safe to say, I'm going state to state
Makin payments, no vacation when you paper chasing
We don't make excuses, we just make arrangements (just make arrangements, yeah)
Go get the money nigga
Cashville, to Memphis, to Houston, Me, Dolph, and KIlla we all from the same place

[Chorus-Lito]
Where the money come fast, but the love don't last
Fuckin right, had to get it on my own
No I wasn't gon ask, lookin back I come fuckin up a sack
Said fuckin ima stack, looked up got another hundred racks, (Damn) Got another hundred rack
(Yeah)
