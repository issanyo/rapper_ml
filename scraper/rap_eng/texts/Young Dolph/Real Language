Anywhere I go you can check my pockets, anything is tapes. Hip hop. You know, I don't even listen to the, it donâ€™t gotta be the nigga that's platinum. It could be some underground tape I got from Chicago, but I spread that shit around. You know, I really do enjoy the music, I like that hardcore shit. I think it's good. It get me through a lot of shit. You know, it get me through a lot to know another niggas feeling what I feel

My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "Fuck they feelings!"
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
