[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
My lil' bitch just asked me "Dolph what do you need your highness?"
Just spent 100 with TV Johnny just on Diamonds, (bling)
Another 60 with Elliot for perfect timing
Too much money in front of me put bullshit behind me
Hear no evil, see no evil, just see dead prez
My boys stupid with the choppers, young dread heads
Nah I ain’t coming to america, I’m coming to California
All my bitches loyal to me thats how I got my diploma
Versace robe, Gold Cartiers
I do what I want with this shit like Kanye
I only drink syrup, no Bombay
I knew I was gone do this shit one day
You get too much money, then they get afraid
My great great grandaddy used to be a slave
They start to hate on you when you get paid
Fuck it, I guess thats the price that you pay

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
My trap house is my castle, my bitch my trap queen
Auntie a crack fiend yo bitch look like a drag queen (what the fuck)
I bust down 2 milli in 20’s and put it in the wall (racks, racks)
I told all my bitches can’t get in my car with no draws
I wanna fuck bad but sorry I can’t put it in raw
Me and my lil boy just went and spend 20 in the mall
I’mma dog, a dog, a motherfuckin’ dog
I’mma ball till I fall and I ain’t fuckin’ with y’all
All my niggas wear crowns, all my niggas bossed up
All my niggas got bad bitches don’t none of us give a fuck
I’m always on the way to get the way don’t never ask me where I’m going
Fell asleep on a jet, woke up in a foreign
