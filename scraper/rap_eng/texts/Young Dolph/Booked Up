[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm booked up, so double up on me
It's Dj Squeeky and my boy Dolph and Gucci 1017
Bling on my fist, talking like I'm rich
And every time you see me I be with a different bitch
I'm booked up, so double up on me
It's Dj Squeeky and my boy Dolph and Gucci 1017
Bling on my fist, talking like I'm rich
And every time you see me I be with a different bitch
Fall off in the club clean
2 seater nicknamed tequila, all my home boys off the meter
Say wassup to senoritas
Drumma squad track homie and Iâ€™m going in
The brick squad boy yeah you know 'bout to win

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Lil mama say she ain't see me in a week
So wassup
Million dollar agenda, baby I'm booked up
I'm on the [?] everytime I look up
In and out the trap, around the map
I'm booked up, booked up, yeah
I'm booked up, booked up, yeah
Dolph in the building fire that kush up
You know what's up, I'm booked up

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Traffic at the spot bagged up because I'm booked up
Dolph and Gucci hooked up
Got them pussies shook up
Bank account extra blessed that's why I stay turned up
Can't go in my own fucking hood because I'm burnt up
Just left Florida and I'm on my way to nap town
Just left Nordstroms and I'm finna hit Saks now
Niggas wondering how Dolph really put the sack down
Platinum in the street my nigga go and check my background
Mama sound I'm out of town every time she look up
I gave her a couple of thousands and say mama I'm booked up
I never touched that white I guess that's why I get good look
Sold a couple fills of green, keep that on the hush hush

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
What's popping paper route what's up 1017?
Been selling sixteens since I was 16
I need some drank, a whole 16
Nigga my future crystal clear like the big screen
I'm always out of pocket cause I'm booked up
That bitch was too bad, that's why I took her
From that lame nigga
Got some brain nigga
2 girlfriends
That's what came with her

[Hook]
