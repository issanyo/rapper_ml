[Intro]
Drumma Boy
What's goin' on in real life though?
When you get off that microphone
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout for real life though

[Verse 1]
Grandma called and told me that she need a new car
Said she heard that her grandson is a superstar
Mama said don't worry, she sick but she good though
Mama and daddy in the suburbs but they hood though, yeah
My lil brother locked up just for tryna get some paper
But I can't blame him 'cause his big brother a paper chaser
Keep some money on his books, man that young nigga straight
He said he don't want no visits, that young nigga eight
My best friend's mama gettin' sicker by the day
Cancer took over her body, got her all in pain
My homie goin' through it, I see it all in his face
Now everybody bow your head, it's time to pray

[Chorus]
Tell your mama you love her while she here (for real)
Tell your pops that you love him while he here (for real)
Tell your homeboy you love him while he here (for real)
One day you here, next day you gone, for real (ayy, ayy ayy!)
It's that time of the year
It's a lot of shit goin' on 'round here
Tell your bitch that you love her while you here
If it wasn't for her, would your kids be here?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just sit back and think
Do I think too hard or do I think enough?
Everything that I do I got a son watching now
I got nephews and lil cousins that look up to me
Yeah I made it up out them streets nigga, luckily
Only if you knew what I been through
Mama stressin' out 'cause the rent due
Went to grandma grave and told her I miss you
It's hard to stay focused out here livin' in hell
The only way to get ahead is if you catchin' sales
You got niggas out here every day catching shells
It's real life shit right here, no fairy tales

[Chorus]
Tell your mama you love her while she here (for real)
Tell your pops that you love him while he here (for real)
Tell your homeboy you love him while he here (for real)
One day you here, next day you gone, for real (ayy, ayy ayy!)
It's that time of the year
It's a lot of shit goin' on 'round here
Tell your bitch that you love her while you here
If it wasn't for her, would your kids be here?
