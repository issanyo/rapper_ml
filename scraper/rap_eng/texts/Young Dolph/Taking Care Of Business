[Hook]
Walked in my spot, closed the door, what's the business?
What you tryna do my nigga? how much you spending?
In New York, shopping and taking care of big business
Shawty just called me talkin' about she wanna give me the business
I'mma call you back lil mama I'm tryna take care of some business
I'm on the west coast talkin' numbers, takin' care of business

[Verse 1]
I'mma call you back lil mama, I got business to handle
Top floor out in Vegas, I'm flippin' through the channels
Smokin' on the best weed, uh no seeds
Got some red freaks, but they ain't from the states
I told her keep her clothes on, cause I just want some face
Wai for my home boy to pull up and serve me 60 pints
Stash house full of hunnids, I got my own bank
You wanna fuck me bad but she, ain't got no ass she she can't
Givenchy sneekers in the trap, chillin' with my feet up
Two hunnid in the louis duff, it's time to reup
Tell 'em lil niggas they can't see us
Crack a seal on that medicine, po' it up, now I got a 32 liter

[Hook]
Walked in my spot, closed the door, what's the business?

Shawty just called me talkin' about she wanna give me the business
I'mma call you back lil mama I'm tryna take care of some business
I'm on the west coast talkin' numbers, takin' care of business

[Verse 2]
First of all, I'm a business man, second of all I'm a CEO
Third of all, you ain't ever in your life seen a nigga like me before
I invest a 180 thousand on my left wrist, look how it glow
Smashed the bitch then I'm out the door, blue rolls royce unfold
Mom and daddy, they were down bad, 15 I picked up the set
And I ain't ever, ever looked back, I'm in the street where all the crooks at
Where all the bloods and the crips at, that yellow tuss, yeah, I sip that
That yapper make a nigga dip sad, eat painkillers like tic tacs
Lotta sauce like a big mac, slammin' packs like I'm big shaq
She tried to throw me that kit kat, but I'm too infatuated with the trap
Got 50 thou on me shootin' crabs, bet it all on one roll then I bounce
It used to all be a dream, but now there's money everywhere, I'm lookin' 'round

[Hook]
Walked in my spot, closed the door, what's the business?
