[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
She got a fat ass but her attitude's shitty
Met her down in Texas but she say that she from Memphis
Addicted to pretty bitches with fake titties
4 racks on my bitch heels and bag but I ain't tripping
All swaved doses ain't they dope boy?
Welcome to the life of a Memphis dope boy
I cut my own check, invest my own budget
If you ain't a rich nigga you can't tell me nothing
[?] change your life in the garbage bag
[?] niggas can't compare to me, they get body bag
Cash stunt your dollar signs' how we representing
Makin' easy money, welcome to my city

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Makin' easy money, welcome to my city
Where the youngest starvin', so we suppose to get it
Young niggas burnin' legal, and workin' with the plug
Some niggas straight up robbin' just don't give a fuck
Might catch a murder charge when you in my city
You gotta have heart you come to my city
You show them niggas love and you get extra bags
Real niggas on deck
Homie, that's a fact

[Verse 2: Zed Zilla]
Fact
If your ain't talking money, we dont wanna rap
Welcome to my city and put my hood back on the map
See I'm just getting my burr, been hammer strapped
She want me to fuck her good but I just want her cap
I'm thinking murder rape, first 48
A lot of niggas cool, but they ain't straight
See these niggas playing, no hesitation
The same niggas repping, no investigation
M.E.M.P.H.I.S., dope boy money fuck IRS
Young niggas got them plug on the X
Fuck your bitch and I'm gonna plug your check
Real nigga mobbing, choppers on deck
Young niggas starvin', they couldn't care less
Sellin that dough [?]
Welcome to my city where it is

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
Welcome to Memphis where its pimping and bitches snitching
You can get what you want, if you go own in the kitchen
Flipping ditches we gotta get it
Ain't no other way we can get it
If you come around here slipping, this shit all these niggas with it
Yo, ain't nobody straight
Most these rap niggas are fake
So dont go think that I fuck with em
[?]
Fly wise guy, never been a nice guy
Where am from we mad fly
If you think you bad try, last die
These streets that I run niggas [?]
Quickly to claim shit, Memphis niggas lay game thick
Fuck up and come up missing in the NM in with that bullshit
Found you in a church in a box infront of a preacher up in a bullpit

[Hook: Young Dolph]
