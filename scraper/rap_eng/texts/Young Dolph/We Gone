[Intro]
Memphis Trackboy
Let's go
Yeah

[Chorus]
And my cup filled with kush, kush (me too)
And I'm drinkin' purple tuss, tuss
And I'm smokin' angel dust, dust
Man, ain't nobody has (?) us, us (nobody)
Yes, and we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Nigga say I got beef, but it can't be much
I still walk around the world like I can't be touched
I bench curl 50 bricks of furl, my nigga
And I'm cuttin everything but the price my nigga
She said I'm up here where the clouds be
Smokin' weed got me higher than an oak tree
Number one rule, smoke you 'fore you smoke me
And it's ironic that she's smokin me, I'm smokin' weed
I'm rollin' blunts and pourin' Tanq, gettin' my dick sucked
She said I'm in bougie, I'm in Louis while I cook dust
I'm so conceited, like Michael Jackson I told that bitch to beat it
And I'm on lean so ain't gon' lose no sleep, cause I ain't sleepy

[Chorus]
And my cup filled with kush, kush (me too)
And I'm drinkin' purple tuss, tuss
And I'm smokin' angel dust, dust
Man, ain't nobody has us, us
Yes, and we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone

[Verse 2 - Young Dolph]
Come tour my city, ask about this shit in the street
Bruh they gave that shit a new name
They call that shit Dolphin
I'm right here in South Memphis drinkin' Texas Kool-aid
I'm just posted and can stir ya with these choppers
And these Ps
And however you want it
Best believe you can get it, nigga
Me and my niggas been had that bread
But guess what, we ain't trippin
We ain't stoppin' 'til we filthy, nigga
Drinkin' mud, me and Boo dirty
This clip right here, it shoot thirty
They don't want to play
They say we too dirty
They say my weed too loud and my cup too dirty

[Chorus]
And my cup filled with kush, kush (me too)
And I'm drinkin' purple tuss, tuss
And I'm smokin' angel dust, dust
Man, ain't nobody has (?) us, us
Yes, and we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone

[Verse 3 - OG Boo Dirty]
We roll them back to back
I be higher than a motherfucker
Just lost eighty racks, I be gambling like a motherfucker
Fifty young niggas, they actin' buck
Three bad bitches, they suck and chuck
Forty Glock, y'all know what's up
Ten shots to your stomach, open up my guts
And I'll be blowing strong like a motherfucker
Know me, kush is my cologne like a motherfucker
Had four pills, about eight Os
With a bankroll that can't fold
Tatted like an amigo
Dirty nigga, mouth full of gold
Now I'm a Memphis nigga
I stay on my grizzy
(?) in my cup and I'm smoking grizzly
Fly, young rich nigga, pocket full of grizzy
Side with Guwop, yeah made another milly

[Chorus]
And my cup filled with kush, kush (me too)
And I'm drinkin' purple tuss, tuss
And I'm smokin' angel dust, dust
Man, ain't nobody has (?) us, us
Yes, and we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
And we gone
