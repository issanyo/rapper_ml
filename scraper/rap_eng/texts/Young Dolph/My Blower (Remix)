[Hook: Future + Young Dolph]
Forty dollars for 3 grams, told my weed man, roll up
Bitch better know who I am
Told my lean man, po' up
Already worked out a deal
Ain't tryna go no lower
Lil' homie need to calm down, chill
Good thing I had my blower
I'm always chasin' these mills
'Cause I used to sleep on the floor
I know you see me in all this gear (Hey)
Still I wanna have more (Hey, hey, hey)
Been fuckin this hoe for years (It's Dolph)
She ain't tell me this pussy was yours (Uh-huh)
She ain't tell me this pussy was yours (Hah)

[Verse: Young Dolph]
Went from sleeping on the floor
To a stash house with marble floors (Yeah)
Been fucking your bitch for years (What?)
Nigga that pussy ain't yours
Spend a hundred' stacks when I'm bored (Wow)
I'm the shit and you know it
I buy a pint just to pour it
Your bitch call and I ignore it (Hah!)
Look who just crashed the party (It's Dolph)
I pull up in that new Ferrari (Skrr)
The diamonds on my neck retarded (Woo!)
They hatin' but I'm rich regardless (Fuck 'em)
My lil' niggas still robbin' (Hah)
When it comes to it, bitch I'm heartless (Yah)
Do I give a fuck? Hardly (Yeah man, heh)
Aye, counting money with my blower (Fuck)
Dropping off pounds in a Rover (Dope boy)
I fucked that bitch over and over
Until I told that bitch that it's over (Aye!)
I'm on the way to jewelry store
To get some more ice for the refrigerator (Yeah)
Late night counting money, yeah nigga
That's a million-dollar situation
