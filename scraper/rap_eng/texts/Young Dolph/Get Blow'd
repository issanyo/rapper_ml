Hey

[Verse 1]
On the way to this paper, gotta go get it
Ben' Franklyns never sleep so me neither
Yeah, you know how we go
[?] slow moving, runnin' fast never slow
Go get you own connect & watch how fast your money grow
Wow, never put my trust in a ho, no
I was born to be a fuckin' playa that's fo'sho
And I ain't just talkin' about having different hoes
Ain't you a player when you kick it whenever you want ?
I'm in South Memphis smoking kali weed & roll cones
My [?] and my [?] on my 'lone
If you ain't talking 'bout money then catch the dial tone

[Hook]
I roll one up, put it to the five
Relax, inhale then I get blow'd
I call her she came over
Lookin' hella good I said : "Excuse me Ma'am, can I get blow'd ?"

[Verse 2]
I'm standin right here but my mind gone
I woke up this morning with my mind on
Mula, middle finger to you
Approach me the wrong way and the burner gonna BOO-YA
She say "Wassup ?" and I said "I just tryna get blow"d"
I got bread but on my way schemin' to get mo'
You smokin' good but I only smoke the best dope
Come out everyday, fresh as fuck like is my dress code
I light one up, inhale then exhale
I always been different I gone left here
Nigga turn that shit up I like my bass loud
Said have a private smoke session and now a space tour

[Hook]
I roll one up, put it to the five
Relax, inhale then I get blow'd
I call her she came over
Lookin' hella good I said "Excuse me Ma'am, can I get blow'd ?"

Yeah
