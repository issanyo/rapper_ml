Got the Glock on me I don’t talk homie
Big face and it say it’s 2 o’clock homie

(Bridge)
Got the Glock on me I don’t talk homie
Big face and it say it’s 2 o’clock homie
Got the Glock on me I don’t talk homie
Big face and it say it’s 2 o’clock homie
Got the Glock on me I don’t talk homie
Big face and it say it’s 2 o’clock homie
In the AM, late night
I’m just countin this dirty money getting this cake right

(Verse)
My niggas round the corner sellin straight white
Them your niggas starving so yeah they robbin
Hard top Versace sneakers and a pair of brolets
400 dollar polo sweater, he look like Bill Cosby
I’m on my front yard in a pair of brolets
Blow the whole zip with a pair of models
I go hard on these drugs but I don’t pop molly
I got smoking dj hard strong I don’t puff buddy

(Hook)
I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
No sleep, I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
No sleep, I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep

(Verse)
I gave my niggas 90 pounds, a kid wanna smoke
That extra stupid, straight west coast
King shit, smoking on that Sacramento
Police said nigga I call em Carl Winslow
Drinking yellow tough, smoking purple
Pouring up purple, smoking Skywalker
In the 2 seater creepin with somebody daughter
Tomorrow I guarantee that pussy gonn be out of order
4 am still going hard
Phone ring, I look down, it’s my foreign broad
Different language, pretty girl, Ethiopian
She asked me what I’m doing, I said I’m just drankin and smoking
What the hell you doing?

(Hook)
I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
No sleep, I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
No sleep, I ain’t have no sleep
I just be getting geeked, I ain’t have no sleep
