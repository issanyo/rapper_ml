[Verse 1]
The only major nigga in my whole city
That ain't never ever had a major deal
I think it's about time I explain to these peoples
How I did it, and what's the motherfucking deal
Young nigga
Caked up, six cribs
Never ever ever took a bitch to where I live
One day I'm in no Hollywood, next day I'm back in Memphis
To catch my plug i got 3-50
My whole outfit Givenchy
Excuse me [?]
Way before all this music
I've been getting money
Who else came to this bitch spending their own paper
Who else came to this motherfucking [?] with no labor
Young fly nigga
High nigga
Fucked your bitch and told her "buy a nigga"
No lie nigga
