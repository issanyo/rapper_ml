Go and ask the streets, boy, Dolph's do's this

Go and ask the bitches, nigga, Dolph's do's this

[Verse 1]
Play the Dolph and watch the whole club lose it
I make the "Fuck bitches, get money" music
I pulled up on lil' momma blowing on that fruity
I took her to the room, you took her to the movies
This a empire, we are not a movement
I call my jewelry N.W.A cause it's ruthless
These peeve ass rap niggas be killing me
Instead they biting me, so I call them mini-me
Found a nigga in the

[Vers 2]
I'm in the lab brewing on that extra stanky
Phone rang, nigga I need wanky
I love my bitches, but Mary Jane that's my baby though
Shout out to Paper Route, every young nigga radio
You foolish, nigga, I do's this
Got that little mili tucked away in my [?]
My diamonds Eazy-E and Cube because they ruthless
Time to [?] some ice up, I booked flight out to Houston
They say I'm so fly, that I should live in the airport
[?] back and back, [?] just like air force
Told my bitch time for a tour, go and get your passport
Say you wanna see the world, be careful what you ask for
