[Chorus: Berner]
Tracking numbers, I got that info
8AM, paranoid, looking out my window
Tracking numbers, yeah we throw away phones
And I don't like talking, even if it's in code
Tracking numbers

[Verse 1: Berner]
Yeah we really played with the work
I'm playing with my money, put your face on a shirt
Tell that man not to play with my box
And be careful when we talk on my telephone, it's hot, yeah
I'ma need another spot, yeah
I just bought another watch, yeah
I just pulled another crop
For this weed I charge a lot, I move it all before it rot, yeah
The bay is in the building
I wake up, smoke a joint, and piss another million
Many men, many men they want to kill him
But he don't give a fuck, he don't be up in his feelings
I'm on my Don shit, you be in other men's pockets
Stop it, just like a bitch is how you gossip
We grabbed the game by the throat and then we locked it
I wrapped it up three times, box it then I drop ship

[Chorus: Berner]
Tracking numbers, I got that info
8AM, paranoid, looking out my window
Tracking numbers, yeah we throw away phones
And I don't like talking, even if it's in code
Tracking numbers
Tracking numbers
Tracking numbers

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I'm 'bout my cheese nigga, Rottel
I think I just heard the doorbell
I just had an adrenaline rush
Only thing I think about's a hundred million bucks
Small fry lil niggas, I don't see 'em
The streets love a nigga 'cause I really feed 'em
If I get a green light then they gon' eat 'em
The streets love a nigga 'cause I really feed 'em
I earned my stripes nigga, I don't wear Adidas
Dope boy, I might rock me a pair of Filas
I used to look up to the niggas with three beepers
I'm sick of rappers calling, asking for a feature
Went got a plug and ran that shit up with my people
You say you trapping just like me but we not equal
I jumped out the Bentley and hopped in the Regal
Boy I did numbers in the trap like I'm the Beatles

[Chorus: Berner]
Tracking numbers, I got that info
8AM, paranoid, looking out my window
Tracking numbers, yeah we throw away phones
And I don't like talking, even if it's in code
Tracking numbers
Tracking numbers

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
Trafficking, nigga trafficking
Vacuum seal all the packages
Hundred thou under matresses
Backflips on the pussy mattresses
I lost it all and got it back again
Got a bad bitch sex trafficking
Latino, Asian, and African
I don't fuck with Qualy' only Actavis
That's a real nigga, it's no higher
They don't wanna play the high though
They want low numbers, I'm a road runner
Pullin' up in this thing more than five though
Tryna get it back with my bravo
200K through TSA
When I touch down, no fives and tens
Blue Benjamins like Longway
I fuck with Memphis the long way
Shoutout Jay Fizzle and Key Glock
Where I'm from you gotta keep a Glock
And some change on you for when the meter stop
A lot of these niggas never seen a pot
Let alone ever sold a rock
In the old school playin' "100 Shots"
Four eighteens until the speakers pop
If it don't touch down you better not truck it
The boys have intercepted the package
I hope that real was a dummy address
With a dummy name, you know they gonna match it
My nigga pour the eight, you know I'm goin' to Magic
Got a bad bitch but I love the rachets
In the club you know I keep the rachets
Told the plug to drop a pin and sent the addy, it's Philth

[Chorus: Berner]
Tracking numbers, I got that info
8AM, paranoid, looking out my window
Tracking numbers, yeah we throw away phones
And I don't like talking, even if it's in code
Tracking numbers
