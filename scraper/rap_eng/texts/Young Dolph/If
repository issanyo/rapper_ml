[Intro]
Hey, hey
Wooooo
It's Dolph, Dolph Cabana

[Hook]
If I want it bad enough then I go get it
If I want that pussy baby I can hit it
If he can't look you in your eye that nigga lyin'
If she say she ain't never gave head that bitch lyin'
If I ain't the freshest in here then who is it?
If you get money then let's race, let's bet a million
If you a boss then salute a real nigga when you see me
I'm chasin' bag after bag, every day a different city

[Verse 1]
I show these boys what to smoke, I taught 'em how to swag
Excuse me, I'm sorry I don't mean to brag
When you favorite rapper walk in me and my niggas laugh
He showin' me this bitch Instagram but I already smashed
I made them niggas take them old ass 458's back
Pulled up in that 488 I'm all fresh at the trap, yeah
Yeah that's that new motherfucker
They be like "Dolph you a motherfucker"
How do you do all of this shit by yourself
Why the streets love you like nobody else?
My shoes match my belt, my Glock match my coupes
Codeine in my Mountain Dew
Your bitch look like (Pikachu)
I'm smokin' weed in the pool
Nah I don't know how to lose
I spent 80g's on shoes
I used to take pees to school
I always go against the rules, hey

[Hook]
If I want it bad enough then I go get it
If I want that pussy baby I can hit it
If he can't look you in your eye that nigga lyin'
If she say she ain't never gave head that bitch lyin'
If I ain't the freshest in here then who is it?
If you get money then let's race, let's bet a million
If you a boss then salute a real nigga when you see me
I'm chasin' bag after bag, every day a different city

[Verse 2]
If I ain't the freshest nigga in it, tell me who then
Fuck you think you foolin'?
Yeah I just been coolin'
I remember bein' caked up when I was a student
My homeboys they ruthless
I fucked your bitch clueless
All these bitches like me
All these diamonds bitin'
Neither one of you hoes is my bitch so why y'all fightin'
Please suck me up and spit it out and I call that bitch trifflin'
This crazy ass bitch done got the shit all on my Nikes
I'm gettin' high like Clinton but I'm slick like Obama
We move like the mob, it's death before dishonor
Trappin' all winter, flexin' all summer
Every couple months that's another two commas, ay

[Hook]
If I want it bad enough then I go get it
If I want that pussy baby I can hit it
If he can't look you in your eye that nigga lyin'
If she say she ain't never gave head that bitch lyin'
If I ain't the freshest in here then who is it?
If you get money then let's race, let's bet a million
If you a boss then salute a real nigga when you see me
I'm chasin' bag after bag, every day a different city
