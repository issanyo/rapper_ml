[Intro: Meek Mill]
Countless money
Countless money, countless money, countless money
Countless money
Countless money, countless money, countless money

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I don't fuck with these bitches cause they sheisty
I think she fucking, she could never be my wifey
It be the brokest bitches acting like they pricey
I talk that money these broke niggas never liked me
Look at the flick of the wrist, I put the dick in your bitch
Whipping and cooking bricks, thought we was cooking the girts
Selling the fish and bending them corners
I do whatever I wanna
I fuck whatever I wanna
Remember them times they never was on us
I got bodies, I got bodies
She ain't down, I bet I fuck
Legend to these basic bitches, basic hoes I never touch
Tell them bitches back back out the VIP don't let them know
It don't matter if it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday bet I crush
You be liking all her pictures, I hit that ain't never bust
Used to pray get that pussy, I got that and never cuffed
She got mad I hit her friend
I don't argue, let her fuss
It ain't shit to cut that bitch off and move on to better stuff
I got different color Balenciagas
I switch kicks like Mr. Rogers
Bitch better have my money, don't give a fuck if it was 50 dollars
Hit the club, you mobbed up
Mobbed up with 50 cowards
I hit the club, we all strapped
Just four niggas that get them dollars like hey

[Break: Meek Mill]
Countless money
Countless money, countless money, countless money
Countless money
Countless money, countless money, countless money

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what (Preach)
Same bitch that claim she love you she'll set you up (Preach)
Out here in these streets it ain't no such thing as love (Preach)
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs (Preach)
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak, if that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech (Preach)
I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free (Preach)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Zay got the muthafuckin' bass thumpin, Dolph got the muthafuckin' trap jumpin
Doors to the trap open, I'll sell you something
Hell nah, don't ask, I ain't frontin nothing
I fucked yo bitch then told her, "I'll see you around!"
Dolph just skipped town with 2 hunnit thou'
Dolph just poured an 8 in a two liter pop
They say Dolph addicted to these streets just like his pops
Addicted to hustlin', I can't stop (can't stop)
Won't stop (won't stop), can't stop
Never hear me complaining 'bout what I ain't got
Cause if I want it, I'ma go get it
Free my nigga Yo Diddy
Got Paper Route tatted on yo ho titty
Same nigga you gettin' high with he really yo enemy
Everyday niggas cross they patnas out for Benjamins
