[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane’s a G, G

From a to z (From A to z)
You know about b
You know about b
You know I fuck with Wee (Longway)
It wouldn’t cost me but a G (racks)

Every trap from A to Z, white girls want that e, (they want that E)
Hundred K for my SSMC I know the alphabet boys wanna see me (ATM)
Got that Cali OG, my AR in close reach

[Young Dolph]
I do what I want, you do what you can
You a dope boy, I’m a dope man
600 horses in my V, sellin’ P
That bitch use to be thick until she started sniffing p
Streets love me but I’m hated by the M.P.D
Multi million dreams but I have nightmares of the f e d's (god damn)
Lord please have mercy on me, I know I don't ‘posed to be dealin'
So after this pack I'm chillin', Last 8 summers I made me a killin’
OG PT’s made me addicted
Damn near Od'd and fucked up my kidneys
Almost let down the whole South Memphis
I'm in my traphouse letting them things go for the wholesale
