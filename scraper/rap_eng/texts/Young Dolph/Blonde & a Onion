[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I turn one (ayy) into two (ayy), I turn three (ayy) into four (ayy, million)
But I remember clear as day the days when I was broke (yup)
Sellin' nicks and dimes right in front the corner store (for real)
Them white and blue lights pull up, take off runnin', that's the folks (that's 12)
Told mama I ain't with that starvin' shit no more (fuck that)
You ain't gotta ask me, hell yeah I'm sellin' dope (ayy who that?)
That lil nigga 'round the corner got it for the low (it's Dolph)
You ain't gotta ask me, hell yeah I smashed your ho (uh)
Ball around the globe (whoa), rock a lot of gold (whoa)
I call your bitch green light shawty 'cause that bitch on go (on go)
I call all y'all niggas pussy 'cause all y'all some hoes (hah)
She looked me up and down and she said what the fuck are those? (drippy)
Fucked her on the top floor now she loungin' in my robe (yeah)
I can't trust a nigga 'cause that's just the way it goes (for real)
I can't fuck with you lil nigga, I heard that you told
Got a ghetto East Oakland bitch, I call her Keyshia cole (ayy ayy ayy)

[Chorus]
Long hair (yeah yeah), she don't care (yeah yeah)
Extended clips (thirty thirty), hollow tips (fire fire)
Fast motor (skrrt), marijuana odor (yeah yeah)
High roller, bitches say he bipolar (ayy what you on?)
Rich nigga (yeah yeah), bad bitches (yeah yeah)
You can't tell me shit (why?), I don't listen (I don't listen)
Money counter (ayy), lot of hundreds (ayy)
Me and a blonde bitch just smoked a whole onion (hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Ayy what you doin'?
Me and my white bitch just smoked a whole zip (stankin')
Too much ice on me, damn I gave the bitch the chills (woo)
Found out that he wasn't real, that shit brought me to tears (damn)
Found out her booty wasn't real and I didn't give a damn (haha)
What's that on your back girl, that thing look like a ham (fat)
She said she get it from her mama, I said bitch you lyin' (you lyin')
A hundo for my time (a huncho), they like how I shine, hey

[Chorus]
Long hair (yeah yeah), she don't care (yeah yeah)
Extended clips (thirty thirty), hollow tips (fire fire)
Fast motor (skrrt), marijuana odor (yeah yeah)
High roller, bitches say he bipolar (ayy what you on?)
Rich nigga (yeah yeah), bad bitches (yeah yeah)
You can't tell me shit (why?), I don't listen (I don't listen)
Money counter (ayy), lot of hundreds (ayy)
Me and a blonde bitch just smoked a whole onion (hey, hey)

[Outro]
Me and a blonde bitch just smoked a whole onion
Me and a blonde bitch just smoked a whole onion
When we walk in, that's a lot of money
A whole lot of drip, uh-huh, that's how I'm comin'
