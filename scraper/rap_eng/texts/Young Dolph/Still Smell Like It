If I ain't in Dolce Gabbana I'm usually in Gucci or Fendi (yeah, yeah)
I fell asleep in the Cutlass and I woke up in the Bentley (aye, aye!)
In the middle of the projects, around my neck I have a ticket (woo!)
Remember the D.A. stopped me in the airport and took 150 (2010)
Now I'm sitting down in 20 million dollar meeting's (2018)
Huh, put designer on all my nephews and nieces (drippy kids)

Getting chauffeured in the Ghost (boss!)

Fuckin' on the police bitch, like ghost (power)
Look at my wrist man (hol' up)
Ballin' in L.A. like King James (ball!)
Still gettin' high like Rick James (higher!)
Rock a deal, I don't need that shit man (uh-huh)
No Def-Jam (uh-huh), no Interscope (uh-huh), no 300 (uh-huh), no Epic (uh-huh)
Boy my real life epic (movie)
I don't share mines, I'm selfish (aye, aye!)
Sittin' in church thankin' God with 'bout ten chains on (yeah yeah)
Shed them tears 'cause I'm blessed, that's why I got shades on (yeah yeah)
My old trap house, I heard that they had to tear it down (for what?)
I've been gone for about ten years, I still smell like pounds (woo!)
