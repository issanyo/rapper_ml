Mane Wattt, getting this money mane is all we does
Sipping Activist, blowing on some Kush
Lets get retarded Let them 40's buss
And the bitch? Is something that we never trust
Mane Wattt bails of green and plenty pies
Everything for the script ain't let nothing slide
Flexing plenty old schools plenty foreign rides
Nigga violate the money, it's a homicide

[Verse 1:Project Pat]
Get yo head twisted off like a Bottle Cap
Phony smile, fake love, I don't want no dap
Chopper is the lawn mower, cutting snakes in the grass
We don't shoot no warning shots we put bullets in yo ass
Yeah I knew your cousin had relationship in the past
Yeah but just the past cause today you ain't get no pass
Nigga say I'm acting funny bitch ass nigga I'm acting real
Bout to get you some money, sit sat nigga I ain't no deal
Pockets hurtin', pockets starvin'
Ho ass nigga thought you was robbin'
Talking bout it, squawk about it
Fake ass nigga you out here flogin
That's the reason why you off and I'm on
Do what the fuck I wanna do, bitch I'm grown

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Young Dolph]
Mane watt, mane watt, double cup filled up with mud
Swisher filled up with A plus I'm high as fuck mane watt
50 peas for the 50 bands man I got enough
I don't say shots for the records
When I say shots you better duck
Shorty said why you so serious?
Cause bitch I don't play
Getting it in all in North Memphis with 10, Mr. don't play
South Memphis kingpin dropping packs in the north north
Crackin niggas jaw running hoes into walls
Call yo bitch then I pull up
Jumped in that pusssy knocked down her wall
Took a trip to see my plug had to put the rap game on pause
Now im back, Mane watt, Got this sack, Mane watt
Smoking strong, sippin tough and my traphouse fresh as fuuuck

[Hook]
