[Hook: Young Dolph]
That pussy hella good, brains extra dumb
O-M-G, I think I'm sprung
Had a lotta Franklins, burned a lotta strong
I do this shit for fun
I think I'm sprung, I think I'm sprung
I think I'm sprung, I think I'm sprung
Addicted to this fast money, boy I think I'm sprung
I think I'm sprung, I think I'm sprung
I got a bad bitch fetish, boy I think I'm sprung

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
My bitch bad and my weed loud
I fuck lil mama so good, that I make that bitch seem now
Pussy so wet, we got done, she needed three towels
But I think I'm sprung, because every night she on redown
My old bitch seen my new bitch, abd she text me go to hell
I text her back, can I get some head L-O-L
I'm in that two seater, rolling up loud and watching Blow
Yea this coupe might be clean, but my money filthy tho
He want a deuce I told him meet me at the liquor store
Don't ask me if my money dirty, yeah I'm guilty ho
Let me see ya tongue ring, bumping 3-6
Getting  head, while I'm countin' boy
That's G shit

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I play bitches like NBA 2K
New J's on my feet, blunt to my face
Ridin' in the back of the phantom like Miss Daisy
I stay firing up the trees I'm a arsonist
And I ain't been sober since I been born
And the way I flip them whips it's like they transform
Big boy truck I call that bitch Optimus Prime
To a drive head phantom watch it recline
I'm sprung on pussy stay jumping in
And a fiend for them drugs, Tyrone Biggums
Her becky fire, she got me hooked
Celebrity rehab probably got me booked

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Got a two leader with 6 o's
Got a new bitch she wanna fuck
But I don't want to cause I'm too throwed
Went to sleep, drankin' and smokin'
Woke up doing the same shit
The crazy part about it I got a clique of niggas who do the same shit
Flipped a thirty pack of loud and [?] it all with my jeweler
Got a team full of Kobe's that mean they all shooters
Lil mama extra bad I swear she thick as a horse
And that pussy just like my paint job, extra moist
Stupid wet, she got that stupid sex
O-M-G she got that stupid head
Yea I like her but I could only fall in love with money
I'm ballin' round that bitch, but she can't get nothing from me
