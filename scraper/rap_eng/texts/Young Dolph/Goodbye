[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I fucked up and fell in love with the streets
Made my first 6 figures off of drugs with her
Smoking weed with the robbers, sipping syrup with killas
Sunday morning I'm in church but I'm a drug dealer
This relationship that we share is unbreakable
Your spot bitch you got in my heart is irreplaceable
Grandma tried her best to get me to stay away from you
Remember when I got locked and I caught my first case with you
You taught these fuck niggas and shaste bitches that's why my mothafucking trigga finger always itchin'
They want me to leave you alone since I started rapping
Dolph saying goodbye to the streets that would never happen

[Interlude: Young Dolph]
For real
Its like no matter what I do
Where I go
What I'm doing
Whereever I'm met
Across the country doing shows
Fucking bad hoes
Always wanna go back to the trap
Amen, damn

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
I love the streets that's why I'm fucking up in high school
I'm breaking rules selling shoes skipping homeroom
I've seen the youngest niggas pull up on the [?]
On the old school [?] nigga trunk slaming
In the streets you can be a ho
In these streets you can be a boss
You wanna be a hood nigga you gotta make a choice
Either selling hard nigga or your playing sports
Ain't no diploma in these streets just mo' drama
Side bitches who ain't shit jelous baby mamas
I done made it out the streets thank god I started rapping
But those streets are still in me damn i miss trapping

[Interlude: Young Dolph]
Yeah
Like all I know is these streets
These streets made me bruh
For real

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
My future looking scary
I keep on selling heroin
Screaming free the gang fuck the victim and the jury
Just cop me some jewelry
Your bitch tell me she dare me
Diamonds very pretty [?] my eyes blurry
Young Jefe
I'ma stunna you a bumma
Ayyy
Shawty what's your number
I said a lot of narcotics, I swear I don't want it
I'm looking for some other rappers with some good numbers
Label me with the flyest
Label me with the highest
If I supply it they buy it
I used to run it [?]
All of this money piling
I just can't say goodbye to it
