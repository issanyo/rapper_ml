[Intro]
Young Dolph
Yeah
My car faster than yours, my smoke sack better than yours

[Verse 1]
You the type to throw a rock and hide your hand and run
I ain't never cared 'bout shit until I had my son
Met some new niggas that kept it more realer than some of my day ones
But I ain't mad at you, I'm just laughing at you
You talk about it, I go and get it
Bankroll in my pocket as big as a midget
[?]
You took her out but you didn't hit it (lame)
She said that she like what she see but all she see is money
Nah, I ain't a pimp bitch but you can't get nothin' from me

[Chorus]
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight, I need some cups and ice
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Just bought a half a pound to smoke
We about to get high as a kite
Stop at the store, get a grape soda, we don't pour up with Sprite Somebody pass me a lighter, the police get behind me
It's gonna be just like a thief in the night, it's going down tonight
Nah we don't pour up with Sprite, I only roll up the fire sometimes I just wanna get high, go to the house and get fly
Fuck her and tell her goodbye
I got a lil' bitch from Dubai, she swear that she love me she lyin'
I-I heard that shit out of town, it's going down tonight
My dawgs just called and asked me what we doing tonight
My trap house jumpin' like a Floyd Mayweather fight
Stopped sippin', now I'm back to it
Stopped at the store get some Backwoods
I fucked your favorite Instagram bitch
And I hate to tell you she's not that good

[Outro]
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight, I need some cups and ice
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
Just bought a half a pound to smoke
We about to get high as a kite
Stop by the store, get a grape soda, we don't pour up with Sprite Somebody pass me a lighter
The police get behind me it's gonna be just like a thief in the night
It's going down tonight
