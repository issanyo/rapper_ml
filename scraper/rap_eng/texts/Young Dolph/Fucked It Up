[Hook]
Pulled up at the strip club with a check and fucked it up
Pulled up at the car lot with a check
Walking sacks, with a bankroll and fucked it up
Remember the first time I got fronted, man I fucked it up
She used to love her boyfriend but I fucked it up
Fell asleep on thaz lean in my whip and I fucked it up
Fucked it up
Fucked it up
Fucked it up
Fucked it up


[Verse 1]
I just landed in LA with 300 k
Took two 80, spend it with the plug I'm bout to double up
What, what I do with the other dub I took that shit through Rodeo drive and fucked it up
But that's just what I do, black ass nigga fresh as fuck
Eating barbecue, trying not to spill a stain on all this designer shit
Young nigga on every type of shit
Front my lil nigga a pack and told him 'get your roll on'
My trap boomin' but I don't know how cut the stove on
Your bitch in the other room dancing with no clothes on
Gave my lil nigga a pound and told him 'hustle up'
He said my song came on in the club and he fucked it up

Fucked it up
Fucked it up
Fucked it up
Fucked it up
