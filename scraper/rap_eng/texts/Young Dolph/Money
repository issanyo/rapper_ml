[Pre-Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I just made bout 20
I got it on me
IPhone constantly jumping
Thats just my junkies
Told that bitch my feelings
Don't come with a warranty
Since I was a youngin
All a nigga wanted was some money

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
All a nigga wanted was some money
All I wanted was some money
All a nigga wanted was some money
All I wanted was some money
All a nigga wanted was some money
All I wanted was some money
Since I was a youngin
All a nigga wanted was some money

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
On my way from Richmond
Headed back to the trenches (trey-seven)
I just made 5 digits (5 digits)
I bet you didn't (uh huh)
All about my riches
Im rich bitch
Tell the jack boys they won't hit this lick
And Im with a rich bitch
Bet you can't get this bitch
Why you can't get this bitch
Cause she like niggas with bricks
Watch em copy this fit
Bow down & kiss my Rick's
Diamonds blind your eyelids
Silly rabbit, tricks for kids
Ain't show them all my skills yet cause these fuck
Niggas might steal that
Why I ain't take no deal yet
Same reason these niggas ain't killed yet
Keep that Glock with me every step
Uh huh, Fuck nigga can't go like that
Keep spendin 500 on fitted hats
How the fuck he get money to blow like that?
Lighting up a stuffed crust
Go in the back, he gon bust ya
Nigga pull up beside us
Fire Fire, Dj, Drive this truck
I need 100 Million bucks
Bustin in the door, a million of us
My young thugs they got the slugs
Let my mink drag on your rug

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Even back when i was just a little nigga
All I ever wanted was the scrilla
My family tree full of dope dealers
You whole clique full of broke niggas
Pull up in cash thinking
Thats my block
Somebody round the corner just got shot
Police everywhere, the whole hood hot
Trap dont stop, yeah we still roll
Back door wide open
I'm breaking down bales, serving & smoking
Young niggas round here tote big straps
Bet that, get your ass kidnapped
Everything i got, i got it out the trizzap
(I got it out the trap)
I tried my best to stop drinking syrup but in less than 48 hours, man, i had relapsed
Catch me on the weekends selling out shows
Monday morning back in the trap selling boats
I'm addicted to this shit
Gold on my neck & wrist
In my bed 2 naked bitches
Young nigga got decisions
Just a young boss nigga straight outta south Memphis
& guess what?
