[Hook]
I sent my girl a text
I'm on the way home
She text me back that she's waiting in her thong
She drinking wine and listening to her favorite song
I'm about to kill that pussy when I get home
We do what we want cause we grown
I buy her what she want cause she mine
Yeah we do what we want cause we grown
But she stay mad at a nigga all the time

[Verse 1]
She says it's hard but she loves me though
I could tell by how she fucked me though
She just hate when I'm out running the streets
She keep begging me to stop drinking lean
It ain't about the money
She shows me she's on my team
All I do is run places and smoke a lot of weed
I just did four shows in two days
I've been drinking cough medicine like Kool-Aid
I had to cut some niggas out cause they too fake
I've been getting grown money since I was underage
That pack use to come in and it was always overweight
I fronted out and tell my girl I'm coming home babe

[Hook]
I sent my girl a text
I'm on the way home
She text me back that she's waiting in her thong
She drinking wine and listening to her favorite song
I'm about to kill that pussy when I get home
We do what we want cause we grown
I buy her what she want cause she mine
Yeah we do what we want cause we grown
But she stay mad at a nigga all the time

[Verse 2]
We do what we want cause we grown
I ain't going out today, I'm staying home
We just smoking Lemon Tree, watching movies and shit
Drinking glasses of Don P in a jacuzzi and shit
Let's fly outta town
Let's go spend a bag
Let's go pop some tags
That's why them bitches mad
You got what they want
That's why them bitches sad
Let's have some fun and let me get right on back to that cab

[Bridge]
I'm in the projects chilling with my homies
Every tattoo means something that's on me
There ain't nothing in my hood but zombies
About to take another trip out of the country

[Hook]
I sent my girl a text
I'm on the way home
She text me back that she's waiting in her thong
She drinking wine and listening to her favorite song
I'm about to kill that pussy when I get home
We do what we want cause we grown
I buy her what she want cause she mine
Yeah we do what we want cause we grown
But she stay mad at a nigga all the time
