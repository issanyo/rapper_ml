[Chorus x 2]
Bitch I been gettin' paid, I invented the wave
Got some bitches on my line and they go both ways
Cell phone booming juging, tryna catch these plays
Nigga ask me whats the move? I say tonight, I'ma wave

[Verse 1: Ray Jr]
Maseratti floatin', nigga pockets swollen
$500 for the Bally's looking like I'm bowling
Instagram scrolling, I'm tryna dm something
Fuck a young bitch thats sleep, I'm tryna PM something
She just wanna have fun, she just turned 21
She let a couple niggas fuck, her pussy tight as a nun
Put your mouth on this gun, let me blow out your brain
Broke niggas always screaming all pussy the same
Nigga stay in your lane, my niggas shoot at your basket
I know some lame cats, now they ass in a casket
I'm true to the game, like Silkk the Shocker & P
Not staying true to the game will get you 'Murdered' like 'C'

[Chorus x 2]
Bitch I been gettin' paid, I invented the wave
Got some bitches on my line and they go both ways
Cell phone booming juging, tryna catch these plays
Nigga ask me whats the move? I say tonight, I'ma wave

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Uh huh
Sitting at the spot about to pour another 8
All the work gone, clientele gotta wait
Catch me in yo trap nigga dropping off weight
You know that bitch thicker, when she walk, that ass shake
Oh I forgot to tell you that bitch go both ways
Neighborhood dope man, pulled up in a coupe
Lit my weed up then 20 seconds, lost the roof
All these niggas fake, I'm wondering who can I trust
Everybody tote scraps, but who gonna bust
That money I been getting too much
And lately I been getting too high
You can see all of that shit in my eyes

[Chorus x 2]
Bitch I been gettin' paid, I invented the wave
Got some bitches on my line and they go both ways
Cell phone booming juging, tryna catch these plays
Nigga ask me whats the move? I say tonight, I'ma wave

[Refrain: Ray Jr]
Maseratti floatin', nigga pockets swollen
$500 for the Bally's looking like I'm bowling
Instagram scrolling, I'm tryna dm something
Fuck them young bitches, stupid tryna PM something..

[Verse 3: Ray Jr]
Drop the top on that bent, my nigga these Bally's yo rent
I like my pussy no scent, dressed in all black like I'm tint
Hey I don't fuck with these niggas
These niggas snakes & they fake
Don't bring no food to the table, but wanna eat off your plate
Aye shake that ass make it clap, drop it low to the ground
Just got a text from yo bitch, she musta heard I'm in town
Fuck the crooked ass police & free my niggas thats bidding
I send some strippers to visit then throw a party in prison cause-

[Chorus x 2]
Bitch I been gettin' paid, I invented the wave
Got some bitches on my line and they go both ways
Cell phone booming juging, tryna catch these plays
Nigga ask me whats the move? I say tonight, I'ma wave

[Outro: DJ Yomi Yom (?)]
Yea Ray, talk that wavy shit nigga, you know how we do
Cleveland shit, you know come thru fly as fuck, (?)
Wavy players, Big 50's, Big Dusse', Clicquot for the pain, you know
Ain't no wave if my name ain't on that shit nigga
Ain't no mystery nigga, Million dollar (?) shit
Get this money Ray. 'Git Paper, what up?
