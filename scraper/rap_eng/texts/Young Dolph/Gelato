[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her
She want this dick and the stunner, she don't want to cuff her
I'm from the gutter, in the kitchen, whip up that butter
I got this snake out the grass, put it on my collar
I got the bricks from the guala, ran up my dollar, yeah
Poured my problems and pain and sipped out a double
Put in all of my problems and pain, sipped out that double
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Put anaconda on my collar, double G's on my buckle
Bitch keep begging me to fuck her, I'm counting my re-up in duffles
Hearin' bricks on the 'genda, pourin' up pints, first a fender
Up the black and the blender, I might just come fuck her for dinner
Put this dick in her throat and I fuck on the sofa
I'm back, I'm the god in the kitchen with butter, uh
Flip it with the spatula with the right hand
Egg beater, whip it with the left hand
Plug got a nigga juggin' four strand
Serving gelato, cherry pie, OG
Vacuum seal done made a hundred G's
The guala on deck with them coca leaves
Put this dick in her stomach, don't cuff her
I'ma flip the lil bitch with my brother
From the gutter with dicks in the cutter
Plug got a nigga juggin' four strand
Serving gelato, cherry pie, OG
Vacuum seal done made a hundred G's
The guala on deck with them coca leaves

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her
She want this dick and the stunner, she don't want to cuff her
I'm from the gutter, in the kitchen, whip up that butter
I got this snake out the grass, put it on my collar
I got the bricks from the guala, ran up my dollar, yeah
Poured my problems and pain and sipped out a double
Put in all of my problems and pain, sipped out that double
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Ayy, Gucci trench coat, yeah I'm the shit ho
Ran it up and passed the plug to my kinfolk (it's Dolph)
I might fuck you one time and never call again (gone)
Pick up my box for sixth months, I might buy you a Benz (where you at?)
I hate to tell you that I already fucked your friends (sorry)
I see it in your eyes, you catching feelings, please stop (stop)
Now come and smoke some of this gelato with me and count this guap, ayy
Yeah he still got trap money in the safe (whoa)
I might pour an eight (whoa), smoke a zip today (whoa)
Roll another one up right before I penetrate (uh)
These rocks, they really hittin' (yeah)
She said if you want a threesome then you can come and get it
Decisions, ayy

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her
She want this dick and the stunner, she don't want to cuff her
I'm from the gutter, in the kitchen, whip up that butter
I got this snake out the grass, put it on my collar
I got the bricks from the guala, ran up my dollar, yeah
Poured my problems and pain and sipped out a double
Put in all of my problems and pain, sipped out that double
Roll a blunt of gelato before I fuck her
