[Verse 1]
I got no love for a hater, no respect for a buster
My lil bitch she a dime, that's one lil bad motherfucker
Always been hungry, even after the millions
Did a lot of shit when I was young, I hope god forgive me
Took a lot of chances, hurt a lot of feelings
Dodged a lot of cases
Bad bitch didn't want shit from me but penetration
Chasing a hundred M's but I'm starting to get impatient
Benjamin Franklin my favorite
I stay fly in the latest, yeah yeah
These millions getting contagious
Half a million dollar coupe look just like a spaceship
When she with me all we do is go shopping and take trips

[Chorus]
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Gang (gang), gang (gang), gang (gang), gang (gang)

[Verse 2]
Whole lot of drugs, whole lot of bitches
I'm a rockstar, fuckin' popstars
Everybody run when you see that squad car
Soon as they leave everybody right back on the block
Fuck 12
The neighborhood hot but they still catching sales
Every time I perform I feel like I'm Eddie Cane
Bitches screamin' loud, throwin' they panties on the stage
I got water 'round my neck and on my wrist
You got diamonds but they ain't hittin' like this
I roll up a blunt when I get tired of my bitch
Big old diamond rings, it come with the fame

[Chorus]
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane, Eddie Cane (yeah yeah)
Gang (gang), gang (gang), gang (gang), gang (gang)
