[Intro: Moma Gabbana & Young Dolph]
Then we was at rehearsal
I'm like, "we ain't gon' be in here all night"
Y'all motherfuckers been learning the street
[?]
[?], I'm out
Heh

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Three tone chain, two tone watch, two tone drop
Oh my God, he too hot, he too hot
I stashed the million, forgot all about it and let the shit rot
Rich crack baby, mama and daddy both used to smoke rocks
Rich crack baby, now I'm smokin' kush with my mom and dad on a yacht
Same hood fucked my mom and dad up, I made a million off of that block
Yeah, I stay into it with that nigga, but this hustlin' shit come from my pops
You gave me a hard life, but I ain't trippin' though 'cause it made me a star

[Verse: Young Dolph]
Pull up at the club, not a bar, yeah
And I don't even drink, I drink raw, hah, ayy
Came here with a check on these bitches
You know I'ma flex on these bitches
Blue rocks 'round my neck on these bitches
Blue racks, I'm obsessed with these bitches
VVS's, they bitin', they vicious
Blue Rollie cost me 150
Slidin' dolo with my .30 with me
And my chocolate bitch, my Hershey's Kisses
Freshest nigga in the whole vicinity
Fake friends, worse than real enemies
Niggas from school be like, "Remember me?"
"Nah, nigga, did I sell you some weed?"
I buy what I want and what I need
"Why you spend all that money on jewelry?"
Even though you was a crack-fiend, mama
You gave birth to a trap king, mama, hah
You gon' always be my trap queen, mama, damn
I mean, "always be my black queen," mama
I love you to death, it is what it is
Shit so crazy, you look just like my kids
You had me shootin' dice when I was six
Then I start smokin' before I was 10
You and my daddy, y'all made a trap baby
I be cuttin' all of these niggas out lately
Throw 50 racks, watch the scrippers go crazy
No money involved, then I don't got the patience
I'm like LeBron, can't shit stop me
I was by myself, they was 8 deep when they shot me, heh
I smell pussy, I smell pussy
Sittin' in the Rolls-Royce smokin' a blunt of cookies
I woke up this morning and put on all Chanel
I still got my plug on standby and my scale
I still got my plug on standby and my scale
I still got my plug on standby and my scale
Hah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Three tone chain, two tone watch, two tone drop
Oh my God, he too hot, he too hot
I stashed the million, forgot all about it and let the shit rot
Rich crack baby, mama and daddy both used to smoke rocks
Rich crack baby, now I'm smokin' kush with my mom and dad on a yacht
Same hood fucked my mom and dad up, I made a million off of that block
Yeah, I stay into it with that nigga, but this hustlin' shit come from my pops
You gave me a hard life, but I ain't trippin' though 'cause it made me a star
