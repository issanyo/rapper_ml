[Hook: Lil Durk]
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Got syrup in my trap house
Something like a waffle house
Touch down in my trap gonna have Lud Foe wipe em out
I swear I'm doing numbers, I fuck her with a rubber
My nigga getting money, so fuck you if you don't love me
These niggas tried to kill me, these niggas tried to hug me
They act like they all love me, wanna copy they a dummy
But my trap has a waffle house
Sipping lean for myself man
Got a bad bitch for dessert
Got a bad bitch for dessert
Because my trap house like a waffle house

[Hook: Lil Durk]
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
My trap house rolling
That young nigga global
Trapping out a Rover
Pulled up on your bitch it was hard for her to keep her composure
Cough syrup in my soda
Call my plug say "Hurry up nigga, what's the hold up?"
I got family to feed and customers to please
80 racks on my arm when I roll up my sleeve
Another 50 on the charm cause' I been booming P's
Sitting in the hot tub, smoking weed and watching TV
Diamonds dancing that know its me when you see me
My phone blowing up, the trap going crazy
They can't get enough, Dolphy got them flavors
I shut your trap down, the best prices in town
It's Dolph

[Hook: Lil Durk]
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
My trap house, a waffle house
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
We got grits for the low
