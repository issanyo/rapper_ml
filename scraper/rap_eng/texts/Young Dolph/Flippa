[Intro: Cap-1]
Flippa

[Hook: Cap-1 & OJ Da Juiceman]
Pack touch down I'ma flip it
Whip without the chip, I'ma flip it
Birds 33, Scottie Pippen
Your girlfriend a goer, she a flippa
Pack touch down I'ma flip it
Got that whip without the chip, I'ma flip it
And I still treatin' these bitches some strippers
And I'm still treatin' these bitches like a stripper (x3)
And them birds 33, Scottie Pippen

[Verse 1: Cap-1]
I still treat my bitches like a stripper
She bust me down with dome then I tip her (and what?)
If she don't like me, she don't like niggas
Don't letcha girl come 'round me, I might hit her
Black Versace pants, gold zippers
Your main girl a goer, she a flippa
And I don't love these [?], I don't kiss 'em
I'm throwing out them zones like a pitcher
It's 30 shot, to help you get the picture
A hundred pounds of mid, just sent them the picture
Got every chain on like, nigga, fuck it
Just sold a brick right out the parking lot at Publix

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Birds for 33, like I'm Scottie Pippen
Catch me in the kitchen, straight drop chickens
House on the lake, but I'm still fishin'
Nail-shop trap, fishscale city
Trying to dodge prison, trying to see a million
But at the same time, trying to make a living
'Round these nigga turtles, they rats like Master Splinter
Counting all this lumber got me with a splinter
Headed to the Crest, with bricks in a Sprinter
Ballin' all summer, trapping all winter
Plus I keep more chickens; Church's & Mrs. Winner's
And your girl dog? (Ayyyyyyye!) She a flippa!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
My bitch got a fat ass something like a stripper
If you on a paper route, then you something like me, nigga
Dope boy with a dope flow, bitch I'm a dope dealer
Yeah, I love my bitch, but I'll still fuck yo ho, nigga
Sold your brother a pound and had a threesome with your sister
Fronted my nigga a 20 pack and told him Merry Christmas
I'm full of that sizzurp and your bitch gone on that liquor
I had her goin crazy say she feel it in her liver
Spent a hundred bands on designer [?] and pistols
They hatin' but I don't give a fuck 'cuz they ain't fuckin' with us
In the middle of the gutter with the killers and the dealers
That's that Paper Route Empire, you get the picture

[Hook]
