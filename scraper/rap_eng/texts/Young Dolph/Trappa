[Intro]
Shit right here for trappers only
Bad bitches only, haha
It's Dolph

[Hook]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight trappa
You should come fuck with me
I got them whole things goin' for the cheap
And I keep a bad bitch on her knees
I can't deny it, I love the way she ride it
But I like her better on her knees
All this motherfuckin' ice on me
The only thing I love is my drank and weed

[Verse 1]
I've been gettin' money, ain't been gettin' no sleep
I've been playin' with paper I let you play with on freaks
I'm in Magic City with ones piled up under my feet
10 foreigns outside, bitch I feel like Big Meech
Ask about me where I'm from I keep some shit up my sleeve
Bitch I had 100g's before I had an ID
Nothin' but real niggas and thick pretty bitches around me
Me and my boys don't play that
Ridin' back seat of the Maybach
Me and Benjamin Franklin go way back
I know you ain't real because you say you real way too many motherfuckin' times
I know you his baby girl, I know you his, but tonight you mine
Kidnapped your bitch for the day and turned her into Valentines
My fuckin' wrist so iced out I can't tell the time

[Hook]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight trappa
You should come fuck with me
I got them whole things goin' for the cheap
And I keep a bad bitch on her knees
I can't deny it, I love the way she ride it
But I like her better on her knees
All this motherfuckin' ice on me
The only thing I love is my drank and weed

[Verse 2]
She love when I pull her hair and hit it from the back
I said "is it me or is that booty gettin' fat?"
This blunt that I just rolled up look like a baseball bat
Who is this lil nigga stylist? Man check out his swag
I went to my plug house, I didn't go to class
Gave my principal 30,000 dollars just to pass (Dolph)
Young nigga with the badge
Give a junkie 100 just to go take out the trash
Give a bitch 1000 just to shut the fuck up
Rolls Royce sittin' up like a monster truck
Dolph runnin' shit, you can be the runner up
Put 150k on my wrist
I put Dolce and Gabbana on my bitch, uh

[Hook]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight trappa
You should come fuck with me
I got them whole things goin' for the cheap
And I keep a bad bitch on her knees
I can't deny it, I love the way she ride it
But I like her better on her knees
All this motherfuckin' ice on me
The only thing I love is my drank and weed
