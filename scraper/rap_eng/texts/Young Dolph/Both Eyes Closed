[Intro]
We got London on da Track
Drop top, wop
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say about the clothes and the pics I post
But it's a beautiful day outside today
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me 200 grand and I'ma count it by hand all hundreds with both eyes closed

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I've got a chick so fine, make a blind man see her
She runnin' through my mind, that's a fine idea
And I ain't Blake Griffin, I don't drive no Kia
If it ain't 10 mil, I can't sign no deal
I'm all about a check, fresh Nikes, let's do it
And I spy a bitch that wanna straight, get to it
Trap tutorial, ridin' down Memorial
From the bando to the Waldorf Astoria
If you don't like to see niggas shine, then close your eyes then
I'll be on a private island, vibin' to violins
Autobiography, Gucci Mane the author
And I'm the trap sponsor, Gucci Mane's the father
An eight figure nigga just walked into Walter's
If you ain't gettin' money then move out of Georgia
100 tapes and goin', go check my discography
The freshest nigga livin', go check your photography

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say about the clothes and the pics I post
But it's a beautiful day outside today
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me 200 grand and I'ma count it by hand all hundreds with both eyes closed

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just drove the Tesla with both eyes closed
Made a 100 thousand on the one-eyed stove
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Ch√£o
Makin' money in piles sellin' people the Pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to Roc just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, 'Ye to the game

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say about the clothes and the pics I post
But it's a beautiful day outside today
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me 200 grand and I'ma count it by hand all hundreds with both eyes closed

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Don't mean to brag and boast, but I be fresher than most
Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
And she said "Let's make love", want me to fuck with my eyes closed
But lil' mama so fine when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it both eyes closed
(You're crazy bruh)
Ha, wait a minute, I'm fresh as fuck, let me strike a pose
Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe
Since a juvenile I stuck to the G code
Servin' out the kitchen but I never touched the stove
I told my bitch "You mine's now, you ain't gotta work
Just keep it real and let's go spend the mils"

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say about the clothes and the pics I post
But it's a beautiful day outside today
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me 200 grand and I'ma count it by hand all hundreds with both eyes closed
