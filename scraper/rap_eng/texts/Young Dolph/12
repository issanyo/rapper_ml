[Hook: Bino Brown]
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
I don't fuck with 12 man, you already know
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
I don't fuck with 12 man, you niggas just some hoes

[Verse 1: Bino Brown]
Worldwide plug, I sent 'em to [?]
Fifty thousand profit, man just chilling in a bando
Styling in my trap, dog, this shit should be a movie
Maison Margiela's dog, these ain't no Gucci's
I bus the bowls, never touch the pot, nah
Cruise the world, [?] with a thot, yeah
Man, these niggas better get with the program
These bitches trickin' on their daddy
Nigga you don't know now
I keep it too real, you might get your feelings hurt
Nigga I get it out the mud, my momma say I'm doing dirt
It's Bino up in this bitch and ain't none realer
More money, more problems, I got more killers

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
I don't fuck with 12 man, you already know
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
I don't fuck with 12 man, you niggas just some hoes

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
In the 12th grade I knocked up on a bankroll
R.I.P to my lil nigga, Bankroll, yeah
150 bands on my left hand, diamonds and gold
Down in ATL, left the 12 with four hoes
Bet them boys come sweat ya
Under pressure you gon' fold
My trap house on fire, but my heart is ice cold
Balling on these fuck niggas, can't take it when I go
Just down 40, [?] doubled back to get some more
I see police over here, I see police over there
Screaming "Free my nigga Gucci"
Also screaming "Fuck 12"
Jumped up off the porch, head first, by my fucking self
Been running circles around these niggas so long
I'm running out of breath

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
I don't fuck with 12 man, you already know
I jumped off the porch when I was 12 years old
I bought my first pack and I had 12 things sold
I was flexing hard, I had 12 chains gold
