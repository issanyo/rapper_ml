[Hook]
I got a whole lot of guap
Lot of pussies hatin', tell them I said don't stop
I got a whole lot of cars
Bad bitches love rich niggas, I swear to God
I smoke a whole lot of weed
I got two white girls at the Four Seasons on their knees
I sold a whole lot of bags
I think I need to slow it down, I'm livin' too fast

[Verse 1]
One coupe, two coupes, three coupes, no roof
What I'm rockin', Versace snow boots
I'm ballin', they mad, I hit the blunt and laugh
I fucked your bitch, I'm sorry, my bad
Christian Dior, my bitch, she spoiled
I'm pourin' up Act in a Rolls Royce
Big diamonds, big, timin'
One truck, two trucks, my shooters behind me
One milly, two milly, three milly, four
Go get the money, nigga go
Got paper on my motherfucking mind
Your baby momma on my motherfucking line

[Hook]
I got a whole lot of guap
Lot of pussies hatin', tell them I said don't stop
I got a whole lot of cars
Bad bitches love rich niggas, I swear to God
I smoke a whole lot of weed
I got two white girls at the Four Seasons on their knees
I sold a whole lot of bags
I think I need to slow it down, I'm livin' too fast

[Verse 2]
Pull up, jump out, something foreign
Got too high, woke up, forgot where I was this morning
Young nigga, ballin', NBA
Ask her do she wants some keys and shot her in her face
A lot of whips, a lot of ice
A lot of chips, I'm livin' life
Mercedes Benz 600, parked outside of Benihanas
400 thousand in my backpack and a half a P
She call me, I text her, I'm on the way
These niggas, they fake, they hate, I'm paid

[Hook]
I got a whole lot of guap
Lot of pussies hatin', tell them I said don't stop
I got a whole lot of cars
Bad bitches love rich niggas, I swear to God
I smoke a whole lot of weed
I got two white girls at the Four Seasons on their knees
I sold a whole lot of bags
I think I need to slow it down, I'm livin' too fast
