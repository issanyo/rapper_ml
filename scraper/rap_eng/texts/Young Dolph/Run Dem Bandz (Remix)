[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Run them bands
Watch me run them bands
50 grand, 100 grand
No more hiding work up in the trash can

[Pre-Verse: Mista Cain]
50 bands, 50 bands (50 racks)
That will get you flushed, nigga
50 bands, 50 bands (50 bands)
That’s what got you flushed, nigga

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
I can’t see how these haters have time to be haters
Halftime I lost a nine piece on them Lakers
My foreign said your time piece is so amazing
I still don’t know her origin I think she black and asian
Trigger finger on the same hand that rocked your cradle
If money grew on trees I'll grow a hundred acres
I'm from the jungle you might see Tarzan or alligators
Miami on a jet boat parasailing
Baby Cain told me daddy thats a lot of money
I told him son When you grow up you gone have this money
I remember I was on knuckles with no money
Last year I had that contraband, that mojo money

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Run them bands
Watch me run them bands
50 grand, 100 grand
No more hiding work up in the trashcan

[Bridge: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man
I'm the money man
I'm running man (It's Dolph)
I'm running man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
A hundred bands, a hundred grand
How you become a pussy, I don’t understand
I walk up in the spot like I'm da man
I pitched him a 20 piece underhand
If you ain't whipping in a foreign, nigga, what you riding in
If he can’t look you in your eyes then that nigga lying
He spent all his money cars but I don’t never drive 'em
My lil niggas ruthless they all bout they scrilla
I give a dub they coming to get ya
They ain't got no Instagram and they don’t pictures
My wrist look like a motherfuckin' bowl of glitter

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Run them bands
Watch me run them bands
50 grand, 100 grand
No more hiding work up in the trashcan

[Bridge: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man
I'm the money man
I'm running man (It's Dolph)
I'm running man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man

[Verse 3: Mista Cain]
My bitch don’t never have no patience she need money now
When I call shawty coming on the dime
Just left Johnny bought my daughter some diamonds
Touchdown started running, call it perfect timing
Back to them bands, them big blue c notes
I get money while I ride round bump cbo
I just  er and dismiss her I don’t think she know
Thats the only chick I love thats my girl ebo
UMG (cain music) I’m still thuggin'
I got the same uzi
Bang bang you fuck boy
If you think I’m finna stop meet me at the top

[Chorus: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Run them bands
Watch me run them bands
50 grand, 100 grand
No more hiding work up in the trashcan

[Bridge: Mista Cain]
I'm the money man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man
I'm the money man
I'm running man (It's Dolph)
I'm running man
I'm running man
Like a wanted man
