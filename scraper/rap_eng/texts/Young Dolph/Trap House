[Verse 1: DC Young Fly]
Welcome to the trap house
Couple fiends get you cashed out
Get it in, get it back out
Cut the plug, run the pack out
Got weed, money crack out
Couple handguns, chopper then a MAC out
Nigga play stupid then the mask out
Shoot street life, ride through, it's a blackout
Once you in the trap, gotta stay, can't tap out
Every single player got the gack out
If you tryna rob get the Uh boom smash out
Never give a nigga chance to brab out
Like I was out there lookin' for a handout
Started with a three-five, now I got a trap house
Niggas hatin' so I got a stash out
Pistol on me like a IV like I'm 'bout to pass out, nigga
Know that!

Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
I got pills, I got molly, I got weed
I got everything you need
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house
Welcome to the trap house

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I got a ton of marijuana at the spot
You run out with a ounce nigga, you gettin' shot
Got dick for your bitch and two middle fingers for the cops
You trappin' out here, you better keep bangers on the block, yup
It ain't no rules, you snooze, you loose
Just because I serve you, nigga, don't mean you cool
Make one false move and leave yo ass in a blood of pool
Don't trust nobody business way since I was in school
