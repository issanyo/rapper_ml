[Hook]
I smoke the best cannabis, you can tell by the aroma
Thinkin' Like Pac like Pac, I see death around the corner
I'm feelin' Like Biggie I'm ready to die
Bury me and B.I.G and tell my momma don't cry
I smoke the best cannabis, you can tell by the aroma
I'm thinkin' Like Pac like Pac, I see death around the corner
I'm feelin' Like Biggie I'm ready to die
Bury me and B.I.G and tell my momma don't cry


I'm South Memphis, can't stay arranged nigga
Whoever though momma first would be a maid, nigga
How did you get paid
In the trap working hard as a fucking slave nigga
[?]
I'm O2, nigga what it do
I'm thinkin' Like Pac like Pac, I see death around the corner
Stacking egg white, that's just my persona
I'm just gettin it like  should
If I get killed tell momma that its all good
Wipe the tears from her eye tell her don cry
Bury me and B.I.G and blow a whole pound of [?]

[Hook]
I smoke the best cannabis, you can tell by the aroma
Thinkin' Like Pac like Pac, I see death around the corner
I'm feelin' Like Biggie I'm ready to die
Bury me and B.I.G and tell my momma don't cry
I smoke the best cannabis, you can tell by the aroma
I'm thinkin' Like Pac like Pac, I see death around the corner
I'm feelin' Like Biggie I'm ready to die
Bury me and B.I.G and tell my momma don't cry

[Verse 2]
I believe I can fly feeling like R Kelly
I'm ready to die feelin' like Biggie
The biggest nigga to do it coming out my city
If you dont believe me go and ask the whole city
Never signed a deal, no advance check
Everytime I drop its a classic project
Gotta a big booty bitch out the projects
She make the pussy squirt, I call it waterfall shit
She thinking yo, my collar cinderella
Eyes and she too could tell
Yeah that bitch bad, but she old looking
[?] fucked nigga and his daddy, that's what [?]
