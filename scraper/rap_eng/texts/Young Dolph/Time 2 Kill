[Intro]
Uh-huh
It's Dolph, aka Dolph Gabbana
You smell me?
South Memphis nigga, but I go hard for the whole motherfucking city. You smell me? I go hard for every young nigga that's out here in the streets, gettin' it
Know what I'm talking about, the bad bitches love me, the real niggas fuck with me
That's how we rock and rolling. Paper Route Empire
Yes, they deserved to die, and I hope they burn in hell

[Verse 1]
I called my team up and I told 'em it's time to kill
I hung the phone up and roll up, I'm blunt to kill
Passenger seat and extra bad bitches, some hills
I got the shit on Smash, the streets know what it is
Loud [?] designer-gear, I do this shit for real
Move my momma out the hood, I did that shit for real
Told my grandma I got the family, I did that shit for real
Got a spot out in the suburbs, got a condo in the hills
Whole lotta pussy ass niggas in this rap game
Sit back and laugh and I ain't saying no thing
Fake ass nigga, you can never be Dolph nigga
Boss nigga, took a quarter-million dollar loss, nigga
I can show you how to get it in and get it off, nigga
Promise you keep your mouth closed if you get caught nigga
My favourite pistol is the one that holds a hundred rounds
No competition in sight, so I flipped the whole town
[?] fire, that's why I stay higher
Word in the street, I'm the number 1 supplier
I keep some loud rolled up, all I need is a lighter
Your hoe say she fucked me, my nigga, well that bitch a liar
Yo, pull up on the side of me unless you  [?]
Got a coupe and a Chevelle, I don't know which one tighter
Betting a hundred a game, playing Street Fighter
7 Franklin's for my sneakers, but that's something minor
Paper Route Empire, they niggas know what's poppin'
I'm from the side of town, where most of everybody robbin'
All I know is work, I ain't got time to chill
All my niggas need a milli, so it's time to kill

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, it's Dolph
Yes, they deserved to die, and I hope they burn in hell
Uh-huh
Niggas know what it is
Paper Route Empire
No motherfucking deal
It's the time to kill
Dolph, Squeeky what it is my nigga
Money-making murderer what it is man
[?] what's poppin'
South Memphis
Yeah, yeah
