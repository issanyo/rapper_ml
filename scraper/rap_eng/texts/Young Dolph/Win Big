[Verse 1: Berner]
Believe me, I can move a hundred pack easy
LVs on my feet 'cause I don't rock Yeezys
Yeah the dope game need me
I'm up in the hills so it might be hard to reach me
No service on my phone while I'm lookin' through bags
This is fresh off the lot, take a look at the tags
Got a spot in Miami, lil mami is bad
You could tell how she acts, she had a problem with dad
Man these strippers be the worst, they be dying from thirst
She off perc, all drunk, looking tired at work
Bring that money back home, this is paradise
Keep a forty on me, why you scared to wear your ice?
We be all through the city just hiding from Vice
Got pascotti rolled up, homie pass me the light
This that fly shit, yeah that get high shit
Lemonade resin with the lemonade tie stick

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I still can't believe it, that I really did it
Having my way with this shit, that's including these bitches
You not 'bout your digits, I don't wanna kick it
Bitch shut up and listen, bitch play your position
Look how these rocks glisten, trigger finger itching
A whole lot of friends or a whole lot of millions
One or the other, in the Rari burning rubber
Pretty face, fat ass, I might take a chance
In the club rolling blunts while my diamonds dance
I'm just having fun, I'm just living life
What we had to buy, you should've seen it last night
Shoot a thousand, bet another thousand, roll the dice
Send a thirty plus another forty over night
We was living fast, gamble big, win bigger
We was living fast, gamble big, win bigger
Yeah we living fast, gamble big, win bigger
Yeah we living fast, gamble big, win bigger
Yeah I did it and I'm still with all my niggas, ayy

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?

[Verse 3: Ampichino]
Count another mil, do another deal
Even though he owe me scril that's my brother still
Smoke another blunt, pop another pill
We was on the hunt tryna get it how we live
Fuck how you feel
We all night grating
Slap some sense in your wife while my eyes glisten
I first got my name from the white chickens
I'm stuck in the game but this the life nigga
My niggas want to stunt, I take a flight with ya
I voted for Trump 'cause I don't like niggas
My pockets got the mumps, I don't like swishers
Two packs of backwoods and a pint of liquor
Your bitch on my dick, I won't let her lick it
You was rap about the life I live but never lived it
I done did it, I got rich twice in the kitchen
If I get caught with these kicks, get a life sentence

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?
Got one life to life, zero fucks to give
Smoke another P, count another mil
Wake up every morning, can't believe this shit real
Wake up every day like how the fuck I get here?
