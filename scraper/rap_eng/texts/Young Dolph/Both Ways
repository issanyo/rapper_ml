Its Dolph

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Pull up in some fast, Pockets full of cash
I can’t drive that car if it don’t got 200 on the dash
I pull up on lil mama smoke a blunt and drop some swag
Another presidential Rollie, I had to drop a bag
Momma said before ya cross the street look both ways
Got this short bad bitch that love foreplay
She can roll up weed and she go both ways
She told her friend to join and she said okay

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Trap nigga living’ luxury, don’t got no time for the fuckery
Why keep fuckin’ up and miscounting
She talk too much I had to put hat bitch out
I’m rocking timbs you probably never seen before
I stopped drinking syrup and started drinkin’ mo (raw)
My engine in the fuckin’ trunk, my trunk in the motherfuckin’ front
Gelato in my motherfuckin’ blunt (strong)
Doing what I wanna cause I got what they want
One hand on the wheel, one hand on her thigh
She wanna fuck me bad I can see it her eyes

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
She told her friend to join in, aw shit I’m goin’ in
I had my way with these bitches, I don’t lay with these bitches
I don’t chase none these bitches, I just skate on these bitches
Lil mama so thick that she can’t hide it
If it don’t cost 100 or more I can’t drive it
The way I killed that pussy up she say thats domestic violence
My sneakers match the car thats what you call style (swag)
While they steady hate the money still piling’ (add it up)
All this dedication got me a lot of guap (a lot of guap)
They say never say never but I never stop
I pull up and pull out droppin’ swag in that drop
