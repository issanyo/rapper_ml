[Intro]
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of flexin' goin' on, yeah
Whole lot of money counting goin' on
Ha, paper route business

[Hook]
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
I'm 'bout that paper for real, man, y'all lil' niggas just be playin', aye
12 years old, I said I never let a bitch play me
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
Foreigns all a nigga drive, I'm all 'bout a dollar signs
Everyday I wake up I got new haters, tell 'em to fall in line
Boy you a worker, nigga I'm a boss
That means I get all of mine
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby

[Verse 1]
Sak's Fifth bags in the trunk and two bitches with me
I'm fresh as a bitch, and I got two pistols with me
Buss down Rollie, it got residue on it
Dolce and Gabbana everything, and I got these ice cubes on me
Don't know how I do it, don't know how I did it
I ran off these millions (what you do?)
I shit on fuck niggas and leave bitches all in their feelings
In the living room counting guap
Outlaw like 'Pac
Sixty-thousand on a watch
400 on a drop
Went from standing on the block
To now we're sitting at the top
Coppin' coupes off the showroom
Doing donuts out the lot
I just poured up me a eighth to drink
Smoking kush, trying to break the bank, aye
I just pulled up in a Wraith on an empty tank

[Hook]
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
I'm 'bout that paper for real, man, y'all lil' niggas just be playin', aye
12 years old, I said I never let a bitch play me
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
Foreigns all a nigga drive, I'm all 'bout a dollar signs
Everyday I wake up I got new haters, tell 'em to fall in line
Boy you a worker, nigga I'm a boss
That means I get all of mine
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby

[Verse 2]
I just took another trip
I just made another flip
I just took it out your bitch
Then I skeeted on her lips
Playing with a real nigga
That's how niggas get killed
I count money with the Bloods
I count money with the Crips
I cannot fuck with the fake
I'm just keeping that shit real
Momma had a crack baby
He went got a couple mill
Remember I went and got a plug
I went got a couple cribs
Mother-fuck your record deal, uh
50 bags of gas at the spot where I left 'em
Told my lil' bitch that she a real one, so I kept her

[Outro]
I'm on another level
There's a big difference
Tune in

[Hook]
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
I'm 'bout that paper for real, man, y'all lil' niggas just be playin', aye
12 years old, I said I never let a bitch play me
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
Foreigns all a nigga drive, I'm all 'bout a dollar signs
Everyday I wake up I got new haters, tell 'em to fall in line
Boy you a worker, nigga I'm a boss
That means I get all of mine
Rich crack baby, rich crack baby
