[Hook: Young Dolph]
All of my niggas they trappin'
All of my niggas they workin'
All of my niggas they servin'
All of my niggas they trappin'
All of my niggas they workin'
All of my niggas they servin'
Pour up the drank I'm thirsty
My back against the wall, me against the world
All eyes on me, I keep the iron with me
R.I.P to Doe B, my back against the wall, me against the world
My back against the wall, me against the world

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I'm swervin', I'm speedin', I'm servin', I'm conin'
You want it, I got it, I'm pulling up with it, come get it
I pull up and count that paper then I dip
With nothing less than a .40 on my hip
Got 30 bitches and 30 bullets in my clip
Fled the scene, burning rubber now I'm gone
My nigga just got out the pen now they back home
I had to get rid of my bitch cause she didn't listen
The fuck you think that make you if you hang with snitches
Wanted some new bling on my wrist so I spent 50
Gave my barber a extra tip just to have me extra crispy
Ya dig me?

All of my niggas they trappin'
All of my niggas they workin'
All of my niggas they servin'
All of my niggas they trappin'
All of my niggas they workin'
All of my niggas they servin'
Pour up the drank I'm thirsty
My back against the wall, me against the world
All eyes on me, I keep the iron with me
R.I.P to Doe B, my back against the wall, me against the world
My back against the wall, me against the world

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I heard they hatin' on their kid
Make me pull up on you nigga which yo own bitch
Spent a check on my neck and my wrist and my whip
Just to take a nigga bitch, nothing but Codeine when I piss
In the Range Rover doing 100, switchin' lanes you know I'm gettin' blunted
I can't be nobody else but me, got a lot of love in these streets
Got it out the mud in these streets, went and got a plug in these streets
Came back and flooded these streets
I run game like a pimp nigga
I don't fuck with lames, I only link with real niggas
If ya a real one, we can match a pint and make a toast
Got some real ones in the DMV, Chicago and the west coast
UH
