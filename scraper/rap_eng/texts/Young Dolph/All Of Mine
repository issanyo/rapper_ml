[Intro: DRAM]
Ayy, Big Baby
Ayy I had a thought to myself like yo if that bitch smoke cigarettes she definitely wanna fuck quicker, hah, Big Baby
But then again, shit, real shit, ayy

[Chorus: DRAM]
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I need all of it, I want all of it
I need all of it, I want all of it
Plug ask me how many and I said all of 'em
I got twenty bitches and I love all of 'em
I can't take no shorts
Nine eleven Porsche
Is he rich, of course
Make her panties moist
She thick as a horse
But she can't take no dick 'cause when I fuck her she make too much motherfuckin' noise
Got a bankroll on me same size as a dwarf
We take this hustlin' shit serious like it's a sport
I got so high I forgot where I parked my car
Never settle for less, baby you a star

[Chorus: DRAM]
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I don't want half, I don't want some
I need all mine, yeah, I need all of it
Carry money around with me like it's luggage
I lost a hundred thousand on LeBron, fuck it
Big dog, you a puppy
Them bad bitches, they love me
They always wanna cuff me
Lay me down and suck me
She thick and she bad
He broke and he mad
I'm all about my cash
And that's a known fact
Called my plug and told him bring me everything you got
Told a fuck nigga, boy I'm everything you not
Told a bad bitch, baby come and spend the night
Count this money for me and I'll be right back, aight?

[Chorus: DRAM]
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah

[Verse 3: DRAM]
I need all of it, I need all of it
I need all of it, I need all of it
Plug asked me how many and I said all of it
I got twenty bitches and I love all of 'em
Ayy ayy, all of it, ayy ayy, all of it
Ayy ayy, all of it, ayy ayy, all of it
My mama asked how much was hers and I said all of it, that's all
I scraped this shit from out the bowl 'cause I need all of it

[Chorus: DRAM]
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, I need all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah
I, need, all, give me all of mine, yeah
