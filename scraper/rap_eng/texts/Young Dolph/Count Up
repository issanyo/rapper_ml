[Hook: Young Scooter & Young Dolph]
Count up (x7)
400 hundreds racks stuffed in the mattress 100 rifle ready for action
Count up (x7)
Yea I keep all my money with me but all my bitches extra nasty
Trap(x7)
200 hundred thousand dollar cap whenever I touch the pack
Trap(x7)
Me and Dolph do what we want cause bitch we got a sack

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Count up trap
I don't rap I take it back yea I rap
Wrap em up autograph em and send them bitches across the map
Million dollar house no furniture and it's just pounds of weed and straps
I rubber banding stacks and smoking out the ounce
Bitch asked to hit my weed I told that bitch to bounce
I changed my mind when she got up and turnt around
All that ass I told that bitch to sit back down
All my bitches say they love me but that nigga bipolar
Got your baby mama on the road with pounds in her Corolla
Got your little sister at my trap mixing syrup with my soda
Got your big brother calling me begging me to front a pack
Got the plug on three-way I told that nigga run it back

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Count up roll up bust a brick down to cook up
Playing games with Street nigga get yo whole hood hit up
Choppa hold a hundred nothing but ninety in it
200 hundred thousand dollar whip and it ain't ready
Trap (x7)
Saran wrap my money bitch I'm jugging for a sack
I got six different traps one for the gas one for the crack
You know I like to trap I ion like to wrap if it ain't a pack
Quarter million dollar whip that's how I pull up
I got yo bitch with me yea she take orders
Oh yea her head good and her pussy water
All my diamonds water whipped it out the water
