[Intro: Berner]
You know I'm on my California kingpin shit
Dolph what up boy?
You know we had to flex this year man
This that dope shit
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Clean
Dope shit, that dope shit, that dope shit, yeah

[Verse 1: Berner]
This that ron-ron, that heroin, that super clean dope
All white ashes, I'm stuntin', can you picture me broke?
Only roll up clean smoke, only fuck with bad bitches
If I fall off I bounce back, I'm back to pack shipping
Yeah, in AZ and I'm plugged in, we'll piss on Trump's wall
In October I'm up north, goddamn I love the fall
We throw millions in the war, yeah you know I had to ball
I'ma come and grab 'em all, and they gone with one call, Bern
City boy, I'm in the sticks, I'm probably moving units
I'm loving OT prices, on the freeway cruisin'
Join a winning team, baby are you into losing?
I got a spot out in Houston just for distribution
I'm smoked out on dope shit, touch hella cash
Got two trucks in, that new work move hella fast
He said damn Bern, what is this? why it smell like that?
This that motherfuckin' strong, yeah we call it that ron

[Chorus: Berner]
This that heron, that heron, that heron (yeah)
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow (dope shit)
This that heron, that heron, that heron (yeah)
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
That ron (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
(this that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Cross my fingers, say a prayer
I just sent fifty, I hope it make it there
Soon as it touch down I'ma double back
I want that new Benz so I shot another pack, hey
You buy twenty, I might front you twenty more
Pull up on your bitch like beep beep, ho let's go
Here hold this gun, ayy roll this blunt
Broke niggas don't get no respect where I'm from
Trappin' young, young and dumb
They say I only talk 'bout money, I say go get you some
Load a bitch trunk up, put her on the highway
Sent her off on Thursday, she'll make it Friday
What you smoking Dolph, I'm smoking on that shortcake
Big money shit only, stay away with short cake
Smoking big backwoods like I'm Mac Dre
Smellin' like a pound walking out the bank

[Chorus: Berner]
This that heron, that heron, that heron
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow (dope shit)
This that heron, that heron, that heron
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
That ron (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
(this that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
This that lowkey, that low rider, that get the bitch open
This that top down, that KK, I'm in the club rolling
When I leave three wheel motion
Diamonds on so they notice it
If I ever fall off bitch, then I'll be back to joint smoke
And I keep all the bad bitches
They be on me, they be the closest
I be traveling all of the coasts
I be dabbin' and taking doses
I be with a girl that's ferocious
Take a pic and we post it
Hating 'cause they supposed to
I smoke KK without no caution
We high, hearing the waves from the ocean
Got a big crib and it cost us
Y'all some lil niggas and we bosses
No lie, hit the gym feel awesome
If he in the way then I cross him
Take them dollar bills and I toss 'em
This that stay down, that lay down, that get down flow
This go hard, that go hard 'til you can't no more
This that run up, that kick in, that kick in the door
This that roll up, that light up, that smoke that dope

[Chorus: Berner]
This that heron, that heron, that heron (yeah)
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow (dope shit)
This that heron, that heron, that heron (yeah)
This that heron, that heron, that heron flow
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
That ron (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)
This that dope shit (that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that ron-ron)
(this that ron-ron, that ron-ron, that heron flow)
