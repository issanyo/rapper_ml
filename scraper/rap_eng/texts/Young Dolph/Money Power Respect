[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Rolling up some killer
Pouring up some raw
Who is that just passed by in that drop top “oh that’s Dolph”"
When I was 9 my cousins showed me a whole brick of soft
15 I started running in and out my momma house
I seen a lot of shit I never was supposed to see
On top of the world right now this where I'm supposed to be
Worldwide trap nigga, you just locally
If she ain't got a fat ass then she get be close to me
The hottest nigga in the game and I'm the CEO
These lame ass niggas remind me of CB4
I fuck with you but don't trust you
Diamonds dancin' like Usher
My niggas straight out the gutter
Artillery came from Russia

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, yeah
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, ay
Money, power, respect, yeah
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, ay
Money, power, respect, uh huh

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
They ain't gotta like me
But I guarantee they gonna have to respect me
My bitch said "I know you busy but don't neglect me"
New retro Jordan's I'm rocking, come out next week
Hop up in the Porsche then drive it like I stole it
Knocking bitches down at random, call it bowling
Police patrollin', choppas with drums we holdin'
My weed so potent, I forgot I had opponents
Young nigga hungry I get it but still act like I'm starving
Got a lot of gold chains and throw back Charles Barkley
I'm sipping syrup like DJ Screw, smoking like Bob Marley
I'm tryna see a hundred million, they wanna see me in the coffin

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, yeah
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, ay
Money, power, respect, yeah
Money, power, respect, uh
Money, power, respect, ay
Money, power, respect, uh huh
