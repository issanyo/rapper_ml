[Intro]
Hello?
Woah
Aye, I’ma call you right back bruh
I’m trynna finish countin this money bruh
You makin me fuck up bruh
I’ma call you right back bruh
Shit man
Aye, aye

[Hook]
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
Got my foreign drop top
Parked in front of yo bitch house
I’m headin to the trap
Just came from out yo bitch mouth
I’m fresh as fuck
I’m high as hell
Just smoked about a ounce
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count

[Verse: 1]
I keep fuckin up the count
I keep rollin out the pound
I keep nothin but real ones round me
Turn my hood to kush county
AKA Castalia
I pay her rent
And she hold my sack
Nigga, that’s a favor for a favor
You can have them bitches
I just want the stacks
Lil nigga came up from shit
Somedays I just sit and reminisce
Who was fuckin with me back then?
Who was fuckin with me back when?
Back when my momma and my daddy was smokin
When a young nigga was fucked up
And hopeless
They don’t like this shit
And I know it
Fuck ‘em
Went and bought another Rollie
Got a pocket full of guacamole
I got nothin but designer on me
Two hundred thow worth of bling
Glowin
If it ain’t raw
I ain’t even pourin
If it ain’t bout money
I ain’t even goin
You already know what I’m on
San Fransisco cookies got me stoned
Pick up the paper and I’m gone

[Hook]
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
Got my foreign drop top
Parked in front of yo bitch house
I’m headin to the trap
Just came from out yo bitch mouth
I’m fresh as fuck
I’m high as hell
Just smoked about a ounce
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count

[Verse: 2]
I keep fuckin up the count
I keep blowin money
I keep rollin up weed
In the strip club, throwin money
All these niggas say they real
But most of ‘em the fakest
Two labels offered me two milli
But I didn’t take it
I’m chillin
I’m good
I’m straight
These rappers, they broke
I’m paid
Codeine in my pink lemonade
Givenchy my attire today
For my niggas, I go out of my way
Pussy nigga move up out of my way
I had to go hard for this shit
Nigga, I put my heart in this shit
Never gave my heart to a bitch
I won’t even argue with a bitch
Some of these bitches more realer than these niggas
Back seat of the Bentley
The choppa hold bout 50
In and out the city
Yo bitch said she missed me

[Hook]
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
I keep on startin over
Cause I keep fuckin up the count
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
Got my foreign drop top
Parked in front of yo bitch house
I’m headin to the trap
Just came from out yo bitch mouth
I’m fresh as fuck
I’m high as hell
Just smoked about a ounce
I’m steady startin over
I keep fuckin up the count
