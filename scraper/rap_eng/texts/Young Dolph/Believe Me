[Chorus]
Believe me
Took a hundred thou' to my jeweler, told him freeze me
I can fuck your bitch any day of the week, believe me
Pulling up in all type of foreigns, shit, that's how we be
Ain't nothing more important than getting this money, believe me
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Believe me, believe me
Took a hundred to my motherfuckin' jeweler just to freeze me

[Verse 1]
A hundred with the jeweler (VS)
In the club spending money, shining like hooper (ball)
I'm the type of nigga split a million with the shooters (trap)
I look up to the bosses like Tookie and Larry Hoover (hey)
Yeah, neck full of ice (ice)
Did a lot of wrongs just to get my money right (right)
I tell these rappers stay away with that fake shit (stay away)
'Cause I got niggas round me that still like to take shit, yeah
She calls all my cars spaceships, yeah (spaceships)
I work the trap in the day shift, yeah (day shift)
A crack baby worth ten mil, yeah (ten mil)
Still turnin' down record deals, ha

[Chorus]
Believe me
Took a hundred thou' to my jeweler, told him freeze me
I can fuck your bitch any day of the week, believe me
Pulling up in all type of foreigns, shit, that's how we be
Ain't nothing more important than getting this money, believe me
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Believe me, believe me
Took a hundred to my motherfuckin' jeweler just to freeze me

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
If you my nigga, you my nigga then
I told all of my bitches that they mine forever
I told all my niggas we don't compete, we shine together
Extra money buried for my son and I can't wait to tell him
Lil nigga you got a million dollar shovel (dig it up)
In the streets, felt like I was dancing with the devil (uh-huh)
Made a lot of money, lost a lot of friends though (damn)
Your homies loyal 'til the one time you tell 'em no (damn)
I vow to never let another nigga raise my kids (nah)
Nigga them your responsibilities, not his (for real)
Real niggas walk in, and they get nervous (why)
Everything I'm getting right now, I deserve it

[Chorus]
Believe me
Took a hundred thou' to my jeweler, told him freeze me
I can fuck your bitch any day of the week, believe me
Pulling up in all type of foreigns, shit, that's how we be
Ain't nothing more important than getting this money, believe me
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Yeah we here now, but it wasn't easy
Believe me, believe me
Took a hundred to my motherfuckin' jeweler just to freeze me
