[Intro]
I woke up this morning, rolled a blunt, and took a shit
Country nigga, made my bitch cook me some fish and grits
My teacher asked me what I wanna be, I said rich
Seems like I jumped in this rap game just to take a shit

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, rolled a blunt, and took a shit
Country nigga, made my bitch cook me some fish and grits
My teacher asked me what I wanna be, I said rich
Seems like I jumped in this rap game just to take a shit
The realest nigga in it, everybody know it
Yeah he can rap, but he lying, I'm through sugarcoating
And oh yeah him, yeah he cool, but he fake as fuck
Doing all that tricking on that bitch, still fucked yo baby mama
Y'all can stop sweating, I ain't gonna say y'all name
The streets know what's up, nigga they know y'all lame
Nigga won't even holla at me but he bumping my music
That shit crazy, I feel like Boosie

[Hook]
I think these niggas scared of me(X8)

[Verse 2]
Hold up, free Badazz
Say it one more time, free Badazz
Shout out to my brother, and the whole south side of Baton Rouge
Smoking weed, fucking with bitches, got my pistol in a cup
Nigga, even step on my shoe, we gonna tie this bitch up
After the club I want some head so I called and woke yo bitch up
Tell that nigga you about to go jogging, bitch get up
The only niggas flooding the streets literally is us
Niggas hating bitches too but I don't give a fizzuck
You run yo mouth, I run these streets
You love these hoes, I dog these freaks
I was taught go find a plug and be all you can be
South Memphis Kingpin, actually that's why

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's Dolph
Smell me
Baton Rouge, what's poppin?
Free Badazz
