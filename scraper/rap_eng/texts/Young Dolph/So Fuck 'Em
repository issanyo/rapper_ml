[Verse 1]
Me and my lil' bitch just fucked another bitch (what? Huh)
Me and my niggas just hit another lick (another lick)
I'm with the same gang that I started with (gang, gang)
It's 'til death do us part, you little bitch (la familia)
I send all my side bitches to go buy all my choppas (woah)
Put my trap house in they name, they do it with no problem (woah)
Got a fine OG bitch, she still like to wear Prada (Prada)
38 years old and she look just like a model (she bad)
She kept it so real that I put her in a Drizzop (drop)
Yeah, that boy went corporate but he straight up off the Blizzock (block)
Meet me at the top, the realist advice I can give you is to never stop (ey, never)
They ask me for the key because I got this shit on lock (yeah)
Me and 40 bad bitches smokin' on a yacht (it's Dolph)
I'm programmed to get money everyday like a robot (it's Dolph)
I know you think I'm fuckin' with these bitches but I'm not (not)
Nah lil' mama, I'm not

[Chorus]
Ever since a minor I been all about my business (straight up)
I might lie to you sometimes 'cause I care 'bout your feelings (sorry)
Nah, I don't love her (nah)
Yeah, I prolly fucked her (yeah)
Nah, I don't like her (nah)
Baby, I just one night her (ayy)
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
None of these niggas, I don't trust 'em
Trust 'em, trust 'em, trust 'em, trust 'em
Trust 'em, trust 'em, fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
If he ain't hustler, fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
None of these niggas I don't trust 'em (fuck 'em)
Done worked too hard out here
For you to run off here and fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
Fucking with this bad bitch one night and got in trouble (damn)
Flyin' down the E-way on that codeine seein' double (yeah)
I lie because I didn't know her name bae, I just fucked her (sorry)
Fucked her one time in the the car, bae, that bitch don't mean nothin' (sorry)
Might pop up in yo hood and flood yo trap to flex my muscles (trap)
Drinkin' promethazine and eatin' crab, legs and oysters

The only thing that he can do from there is bring you down (fuck 'em)
She your friend but that bitch mad you got a real nigga (fuck 'em)

[Chorus]
Ever since a minor I been all about my business (straight up)

Nah, I don't like her (nah)
Baby, I just one night her (ayy)
