[Intro]
Drumma Boy
Hood Rich, Pee-wee ass nigga

[Verse 1 : Young Dolph]
I scoop lil' mama up & took her out to eat
We went back to my spot & we smoked out a P
Smoking one while I'm rolling up
Lil' mama with me she fine as fuck
She drank it to kill & I'm pouring up
She a Dolph girl you know wuddup
Got hoes like Uncle Luke
I smoke like Uncle Snoop
But I get even higher when I'm counting loops
I only smoke indica bro I hate sativar
Me & my homeboys call it strong my Grandma call it reefer
Thug life, bitch I'm bumping 2 pack (2Pac)
My muscle car got big fit & a big block
Smoking one while I'm rolling up
When you smell loud then you know wussup
Smoking one while I'm rolling up
Only A-Plus nigga that's a must

[Hook x16]
Smoking one while I'm rolling up

[Verse 2 : 8-Ball]
Bitch, I got that hitter 1 time that'll make you choke
Bitch, If you ain't smokin' On this you must be broke
Bitch, I really don't smoke nothing but swisha swish
Bitch, I split my heart & shit on Drumma beats
Streets, I run 'em like 'em were some fuckin' cleats
Fo'-Fifth & ?? well known for my southern speech
Bitch, you got me fucked up ho I'm like no other
My nigga stay gutta, you niggas ain't none but pussy suckas
Bitch, my nigga don't know nothin' but make a ca$h
Bitch, you need to close your mouth & shake yo' ass
Shit, I got that space age pimp flow
Young Dolph & this your fat boy Premro

[Hook x16]

[Verse 3 : MJG]
I'm smoking one & I'm rolling up
In the Cadillac with a bitch frowning up
I'm smoking one & I'm pimp type MJ
Mothafuckin' G & I'm showin' up
I'm smokin' one & I'm pourin' up
This 2 or 3 I made a 4, enough
With a V12 attitude blowin' up
But some of you niggas you ain't close enough
Don't you want feel the contact taste the word
Get a rotation wait your turn
And go from an average nigga straight to perm
Made a kitty cat wanna chase the worm
Feel real good when I mix it up
4 or 5 flavors I keep to blow
Seems I just can't get enough
Now I got a couple I can kiss 'em all
Call my ho kiss 'em doe
Around the clock & we jackin' in
Both you niggas is so full of shit
The only thing that you catch is wind
I'm smoking one & I'm toasting up
To the one that's gone & past away
I shall not put that sticky down
On the smoke real real fat back today

[Hook x16]
