[Verse 1]
What up?
All of these diamonds on me, they say I ain't playin' fair (damn)
Pull up at the mansion, I got cameras everywhere (uh)
Dobermans in the backyard like the president (uh)
Fifty bitches on my dick, call me Dolph the pimp (hey)
Don't give a fuck, ain't a rich nigga, you a shrimp (lil boy)
Court side with my lil son watchin' LeBron and them, hah
P's of cannabis, my nigga I sold tons of them, hah
Drop a bag on his head, each and every one of them, hah
And these bitches (what?), nah, we don't love none of them (nah)
The police get behind this Rari, I'ma run from them (skrrt)
You know that they smokin' weed and they got guns in there (yeah yeah)
Got a bad bitch waitin' on me with no underwear (yeah yeah)
Black skirt, not a lick of panties under there (uh-huh)
Gangster from the start, my heart ain't got no love in there (uh-huh)
They always on my IG just to see what I wear
Got somebody's bitch bent over, from the back and pullin' hair (huh)
Fuck it, I don't care (fuck it)
Count better than I spell (fuck it)

Fuck 'em, send some shells (fuck 'em)

[Verse 2]
Look how that shit hit (shine), Michael Jackson dancin' (dance)
White bitch told me she wanna go fuck to Marilyn Manson (hol' up)
My hood bitch said she wanna fuck me good then make a sandwich (okay)
I turned it to a traphouse but at first it was abandoned (trap)
The game been good to me (yeah)
A quarter milly every week (yeah)

I fucked your favorite public figure but she say we dated (uh-uh)
My lil nigga can't stay out of jail, he keep catchin' cases (damn)
Two of my dogs, they fell out 'bout money and I swear I hate it (shit man)
I put extra ice on my wrist because it keep on achin' (woo)
