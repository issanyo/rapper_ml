[Hook]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 1]
Rule number 1, get the money first
Rule number 2, don't forget to get the money
Play by these rules and everything will be okay
Still in my trap, flipping my Frito-Lays
Go get the money, it ain't nothing else important to me
I showed her a Xanax, she hurried up and took
I fucked her so good, she got up and started cooking
Rolling up big blunts, and a pound of cookies
If yeen got 40 bands, then you can't book me
Pulled up on the side of your bitch, she wouldn't stop looking
That bitch good as tooken, good as gone
I guarantee tonight my nigga, that bitch ain't coming home
I got money to count, I got bitches to fuck
I got packs to flip, pistols to bust
When I was small, I ain't have nothing
Started selling dope, and prayed to God for a plug
He showed up and said

[Hook]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 2]
Get paid nigga, get paid bitch
You on some rich nigga shit, we on the same shit
Me and my Memphis Grizzly partners fuck the same bitches
The only difference is I'm a trap nigga
Don't you hear it in my voice when I rap nigga?
I'm on South Beach with E Feezy throwing stacks nigga
Turn to the match nigga, facts nigga
She met me for the first time, didn't know how to act nigga
Double R, parked in my motherfucking front yard
Trap jumping like the motherfucking Million Man March
If she ain't got a fat ass, the she can't get up in this car
I can tell if that ass real or fake by how she walk

[Hook]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
