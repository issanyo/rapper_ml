[Verse 1]
I drink lean 'til I fall asleep
I smoke weed 'til I pass out
Double-R when I back out
Cock my Glock then I smash out (uh-huh)
She look too good, I told her lay it down
My first investment was a trap house, hah
From the gutter but still ain't got shit to complain about
Don't make me send them boys through and clean you out
Rich nigga, bad bitch ridin' with me
Dope dealer, on the E-Way doin' one-fifty, yeah yeah
Pull up at the party like mane this shit litty, yeah yeah
Told my nigga whatever you with I'm with it, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Just thinking out loud
I'm rich as a bitch, LOL
But I'm still with the shit, I'm still with the shit
I'm rich as a bitch, but I'm still with the shit, hah
Just thinking out loud
I'm rich as a bitch, I'm rich as a bitch
But he still with the shit, I just hit a lick
Now I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
Ballin' like a bitch

[Verse 2]
Got a quarter milly on me and a stick
Shittin' on the industry, it's evident
Police don't got a search warrant, they ain't coming in
Yeah I'm fresh up off the car like nigga once again
My wrist Atlantic (Ocean), my neck Pacific (Ocean)
If I said it bitch you better know I meant it
Water water water water water water
My grandma was my mama and the streets was my father
Your conversation ain't 'bout money then why bother

[Chorus]
Just thinking out loud
I'm rich as a bitch, LOL
But I'm still with the shit, I'm still with the shit
I'm rich as a bitch, but I'm still with the shit, hah
Just thinking out loud
I'm rich as a bitch, I'm rich as a bitch
But he still with the shit, I just hit a lick
Now I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
Ballin' like a bitch
