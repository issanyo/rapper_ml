[Hook: Young Dolph]
Still driving these bitches crazy
Forever got a due to the fact that the streets made me
She asked can she hit the weed, I said "That's ok with me"
But I'm still screaming "Fuk u pay me"
Fuk u pay me (x6)
I ain't be feeling like doing shit but counting paper lately
All of my bitches be wanting to have threesomes lately

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm in the back of the back when I back out
Wrapped like a man inside of a crack house
Everybody know I'm a fashionista
Trap jumping up like Stackhouse
Everybody know what that's about
Swag up to my forehead, Miami from a [?] day
Drinking lean on a moped
Inner shake down for some romance
Look me in the eyes like a grown man
Seen a girl from high school
Busting moves on a pole dance
Southside Atlanta shit
Might boss the world with some counterfeits
Tell a nigga it's sold out, killed the game #PaulBearer
I ain't packing for some more there
Long money, long hair
Long nose, leave you long gone
Stretch you out like a lawn chair
Fuk u pay me, kick your shit like Solange there
Comfortable like Herm√®s, drive a ho crazy #AirBags

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
You owe me mula, where's my guala ?
You ain't got it ? We got problems
Got to send my partner them shotters
I mean them shooters
In the club ordering bottles, strictly for the models
Throw a band's worth of Versace, get on one side on my closet
Fuck the shit out of little mama and drive her Looney Tunes
Play with me, I'll introduce you to the Gooney Tunes
These niggas trash, sweep them up, I need a broom
The bitch's nigga she ditched on us and then met me out the room
Showed up in that trench coat, caught butt naked like Robin Givens
Sexy pretty ass ghetto bitch straight from out Memphis
Scream out that droptop : "Fuk u pay me"
You better keep that Glock out, boy you know these streets shaded
Where the fuck you've been lately ?
