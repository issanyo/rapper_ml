[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
2 grands on my shades, 2 grands on my blunt
A extra 30k for that coop cause it go 200
2009 is when I counted my first 200
Plug say it's okay so I'm on the way little hunda
Streets craving, fans waiting, tell them that I'm coming
They ask me where I've been I've been in the trap pumping
First spot, 3 seat is never told nobody
I kick it tough in the trap, no karate
Porsche from reefer in the trunk of that escort
I get it in I get it out, import, export
Louie lugagges, Cartier's walking through that airport
The conversation ain't about money then I wouldn't care for it

[Hook: Young Dolph]
More money more yalts shh, that [?] talk
I call that spot the money house, money talk
Money talk, that's that money talk
Money talk, that's that money talk
More money more [?] shh, that [?] talk
I get it in, I get it out, money talk, money talk
Money talk, that's that money talk
Money talk, that's that money talk

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
That money talking, I'm always listening
My undivided, attention span
Even when the paper whispering
That low load, I'm dipping in
Bend the corners and pitching in
My id say Tennessee, butthese license say Michigan
Yeah, yeah, I'm in the scope
But I still ride like Michelin
I already hear y'all critics bitching
Like here you got talking bout bricks again
My shot percentage is over 10
In other words, I got bricks again
Got a chopper just for you jack niggas
Burn fat enough to stick a missile in it
Not splitting my dividends
With no nigga that ain't pitching here
Got money, I'll get you touched
And I won't even have to lift a limb
I'm balling bitch, I'm 50 win
All first place, no second win
Dolph know I'm gone gonna kill this beat need to notify his next to kin

[Hook]
