(Richie!)
(808 Mafia)

[Verse 1: Rico Richie]
Got a call from a freak with the code name Becky
Sent her ass the addy, when you get close text me
I just popped a addy now I'm about to go [?]
I don't want to talk about nothing but some smashing
She pull up with her partner swear her friend looking like a gremlin
Money making missions gotta stack it to the ceiling
Pour a couple ounces smoke a pound while we chillin
And all she wanna do is talk about her fucking feelings
Thats why (Yeah)

[Chorus: Rico Richie]
Im sick and tired of my old hoes (Hey)
I think its time for me to reload (Yeah)
Im sick and tired of my old hoes (Hey)
I think its time for me to reload (Hey)
I think its time for me to reload (Hey)
I think its time for me to reload (Yeah)
Im sick and tired of my old hoes (Hey)
I think its time for me to reload

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Treat my bitches like my pistol its time to reload
Cash Money Juvenile, Stick to the G Code
Got rid of my old hoes cuz I don't need those
Multi million dollar South Memphis Hero
Phone ring I'm like "What up"
Lil mama thick ass fuck and she say she bout' to pull up
Say she ain't' got no panties on and she bout' to cut up
My old bitch had text me say I ain't' shit
I text her back like "So what?"
Uh

[Chorus: Rico Richie]

[Verse 3: Rico Richie]
Now everybody know where Richie go he bring them bands out
So every time I pull up on a hoe she got her hand out
I got nothing but some dick for you
I can't pay your rent for you
Bitch if you can't do it for yourself I  can't do shit for you
Richie he a asshole
Poured up, moving mad slow
Count a lot of cash though thats why I got a bankroll
Fuck a bitch real good but I ain't' got to brag though
Kick a bitch to the curb you better ask my last hoe

[Chorus: Rico Richie]

[Outro: Rico Richie]
Backwood loaded, choppa clips loaded
Nigga don't pass it if the shit ain't' loaded
Backwood loaded, choppa clips loaded
Nigga don't pass it if the shit ain't' loaded
