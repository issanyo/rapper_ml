[Verse 1: Cap-1]
100 pints in, 100 pints gone
Trampoline trap, jumping to the moon
I make that pack boom, I be done by noon
I make 50 racks, in like 2 days
Got my bitch amazed, all my wiz got spray
All I do is trap, all I do is rap
All I do is swag, I be in my bag
I spent 20 thousand, on Giuseppe sneakers
I dropped [?] pair, and made it back in features
I might rock the Rolex, I might rock the Cuban
I got that pressure pack, or that Whitney Houston
I remix a nigga, got the trap booming
Got that fish scale, them birds are Patrick Ewing

[Chorus: Cap-1]
100 pints in, 100 pints gone
100 packs in, 100 packs off
[?] at the kitchen, standing at the stove
On the phone with migo, tryna get a load
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, jumping to the moon
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, I make that pack boom

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Trampoline trap, gasoline pack
Pull up on my nigga Cap like where the lean at?
I call my Glock fast Jordan, it make em lean back
Make em lay flat, blap blap blap
Pull up at the spot, everybody working
Six scales in the house so everybody serving
Everybody counting, everybody strapped
Dropping 16s off and I ain’t talking rap
You ever seen 30 stacks in all 5s nigga?
House full of turnip greens, no pines nigga
Smoking it and hustle it, I’m with all that shit
My little bitch keep asking me how I get all this shit

[Chorus: Cap-1]
100 pints in, 100 pints gone
100 packs in, 100 packs off
[?] at the kitchen, standing at the stove
On the phone with migo, tryna get a load
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, jumping to the moon
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, I make that pack boom

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Make the trap boom, I make them bricks move
I been seeing bricks ever since high school
Standing at the bus stop, that’s what them dimes do
McDonalds trap, I got a drive through
Michael Jackson wrist, fish scale will blind you
Trampoline trap, jumping times two
Put the soda with the salt and watch the water move
Skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrrrt

[Chorus: Cap-1]
100 pints in, 100 pints gone
100 packs in, 100 packs off
[?] at the kitchen, standing at the stove
On the phone with migo, tryna get a load
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, jumping to the moon
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, I make that pack boom
100 pints in, 100 pints gone
100 packs in, 100 packs off
[?] at the kitchen, standing at the stove
On the phone with migo, tryna get a load
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, jumping to the moon
Trampoline trap, trampoline trap
Trampoline trap, I make that pack boom
