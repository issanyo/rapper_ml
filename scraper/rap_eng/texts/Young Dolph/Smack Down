[Hook]
Light my trees up, turn the lights down
It's about to go down right now
No, ain't a wrestler, but I laid a smackdown
Rub your rubber on that bitch, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
WrestleMania in the bed, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
Smackdown, I lay the smack down

[Verse 1]
[?] dress on, no underwear
No bra, got a liquor [?] under there
Nothing new to me, you know me I'm a player
She said her friend wanted fuck me, but she don't want to share
[?] get it, get it [?]
[?] nigga [?]
1, 2, 3, 4 smacks on that ass
She said she loved it, shit, cause it made her come fast
Shoutout the [?] holdin' the sack down
Got my feet kicked, no time to relax now
Take two [?] then I put the threats down
'Bout to pull up on your bitch and lay the smack down

[Hook]
Light my trees up, turn the lights down
It's about to go down right now
No, ain't a wrestler, but I laid a smackdown
Rub your rubber on that bitch, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
WrestleMania in the bed, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
Smackdown, I lay the smack down

[Verse 2]
[?]momma however you wanna get it
She say 'Nah Dolph, whatever you want [?] with it'
Warning, my nigga you better come and get your hoe
Before I have her [?] 54th
And then I confiscate top rose
I put the smack down, bitch ask around
Bad bitches [?], right down to trap town
From NRA back to nap town
I light my trees up, turn the lights down
It's 'bout to go down right now
1, 2, 3 and she out for the count
[?] I laugh and it's time to bounce

[Hook]
Light my trees up, turn the lights down
It's about to go down right now
No, ain't a wrestler, but I laid a smackdown
Rub your rubber on that bitch, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
WrestleMania in the bed, I put the smack down
Smackdown, smackdown
Smackdown, I lay the smack down
