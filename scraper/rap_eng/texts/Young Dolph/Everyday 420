[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
When I open up my condo all you see is smoke
And about half a hour, smoked about a half a O
I got your main bitch in my pay roll
She pick up the bone when I say so
I went and got the bitch a new Beamer, told her make sure her mouth stay closed
King pin, Memphis Ten, if I had to I'd do it again
First class in Cali, one way, send 3 bombs in 1 day
All my niggas about gun play, 30 stacks on my prom day
My trap booming every day of the week, but I'm taking off every Sunday
Dolph at the club tonight all the bad bitches gonna come out
I pull up on yo bitch, smoke a blunt with her, watch her show up
These bitches ain't shit, the money I blow it, this shit don't mean nothing to me
Compare me to chopper, don't compare me to rappers, these niggas ain't fucking with me

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Smoking strong and sippin', everyday 420
At the [?] running through these hundreds, fifties and twenties
Riding with that semi, drop a deuce and a twenty
Everyday we winning, everyday 420
Everyday 420, everyday we sippin'
Everyday we gettin' it, everyday 420
Everyday we sippin', everyday we sippin'
Everyday we sippin', yeah

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I stay fresh as fuck, I'm on about 3 drugs
Painkillers, cough syrup and some killer buds
I drop a 8 in a 2 liter that how I mix it up
You lovin' em bitches, then cuffin' em bitches, them bitches ain't nothing to us
Checks I'm fucking em up, bitches I'm doubling up
Woke up and forgot where I was, been going too hard on these drugs
Dees squared up Balenciagas, my bitch usually rockin' red bottoms
I'm pouring up after pint, I don't really need a baby bottle
Money don't mean shit to me, if you a fuck nigga you a fuck nigga
Why would I fuck with new niggas and got old niggas I don't fuck with em
I ain't got shit for a bitch but a hard time
But if she ready to put in some work then she all mine

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Smoking strong and sippin', everyday 420
At the [?] running through these hundreds, fifties and twenties
Riding with that semi, drop a deuce in a twenty
Everyday we winning, everyday 420
Everyday 420, everyday we sippin'
Everyday we gettin' it, everyday 420
Everyday we sippin', everyday we sippin'
Everyday we sippin', yeah
