[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Saw mama yesterday, she said you need to get some rest
I told her I'll get some sleep when I'm dead
And I ain't got no friends, all my friends dead
Big heads and they tied up with rubber bands
Penthouse smoking weed on the top floor like Bruh Man
Still putting bitches up out my spot just like Martin
Told my plug to double up, trying to get that new Aston Martin
Dropping out bails of weed in that V-coupe Charger
Tall ass nigga in that 911 Targa
Pulled up on your bitch got some head, tipped her a hundred dollars
Smoked a blunt with her, got money to make sure I'ma holla
We pouring up lean in the club, you can keep them sparklers

[Hook]
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
All my niggas hustlers and live a high life
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
Forever chasing money nigga that's my life
All my niggas hustlers and live a high life

[Verse 2]
Baby bottle full of syrup, trap full of work
Blunt full of weed, cookie mixed with purp
Fuck me with he don't like living, put him in the dirt
Pull up in that drop and let that choppa squirt
Trapping in Versace, diamonds kicking like Mr. Miyagi
Trap been good to a young nigga, might go get my bitch an Audi
She say I never pay her no attention, she always bitchin
She tried to pour my drink down the sink I said hold up you trippin
I said hold up just listen, you know that I'm addicted
Run with a crew of niggas just like me, out here chasing millions
Don't give a fuck how we get it
Got all of my niggas with me
The best weed in the city
Smoke one, fuck with me

[Hook]
