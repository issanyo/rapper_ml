I'm the type a nigga that'll shoot you in public
Ran into a nigga that i robbed in public
I said i heard you looking for me and he tried to change the subject
Had that pistol in my brief, said he thought i wear it ugly
Up the tone, ready and i ain't do it in the public
Somebody called the police 'cuz they thought i was gonna bust it
I ain't give shit back that is not up for discussion

Pull up in a ticket and he pull up in a custom
Said the nigga had it roasting the pussy nigga lucky

Matter fact, two pistols, can't let you get the best of me
