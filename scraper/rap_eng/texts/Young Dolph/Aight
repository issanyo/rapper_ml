I pay the car like a boss (car like a boss)
I took a lot like a boss
To be a real nigga in cost
I'm fell in love with the life
I'm fell in the love with the price
You fell in love with the [?]
You fell in love with the ice
I'ma real nigga aight
I want the money aight
I want my momma aight
I want my niggas aight
I'ma real nigga aight
I want the money aight

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I'ma real nigga aight (real nigga aight)
I'ma get the money aight (money aight)
I'ma get money all night
She gone pop it for some
I got a whole lot of money (whole lot of money)
Come from a whole lot of grindin'
Young nigga run in your house
They fuck up the place
Then they run back in the house
They run back out with the safe
I heard the trappers aight
[?] a hunnid a week
I heard they watching the trap house
We put the trap up the street
She fell in love with the life
In love with the [?]
She want the money alright

I'd probably fuck her all night
I'd probably fuck her and dip
Got to get back to the[?] I'ma be high as a [?]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Went and got mom a new house
Went and got me a new plug
Did that for me and my boys, plus I just had a little boy
The same day I got a new Porshe
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
Cause I was taught life Too Short
Keep a bankroll on me and a Glock just for daily force
All I do is get money alright
Them dollar signs that's what I like
When I was little I wanted to be like the dope boys
I didn't want to be like Mike
Before I ever thought of rapping
I was catching flights
[?]
Just me and the plug
Million dollar conversation
You know what up What up?
You know what up with me
I'm in a million dollar meeting
And I smell like a p
I don't know too much shit
But one thing I know we gone eat
