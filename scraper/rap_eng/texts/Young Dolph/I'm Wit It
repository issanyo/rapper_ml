[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Black Gucci polo horses coupe in the yard running 500 some horses
I kill the beat and I get rid of it, call it abortion
I just wanna fuck Shawty, I can't be your boyfriend
Money money money that's my favorite subject
I do it for the streets and guess what they love it
Pockets swolling, spot rock and rolling
Hat cocked blowing loud, and my Glock is loaded
30 round extension
I'm bussin all 30 bitch, I don't plan on missing
Get into some gangsta shit my nigga you know I'm with it
Wanna get this money home boy, let's go get it

Fast forward that, I be at the dealership
Okay, I'm riding, they come on, kush my cologne

2 blunts together, look like a broom
2 chains on me, looks like it's june
Ok, you know I'm with it, I ain't with them gimmicks

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Young nigga been out here straight gettin' it
Busting moves and wigglin
No I'm not a rapper, I'm a businessman
Multi-million dollars business plan
Who is dolph signed with, stay the fuck about my business man
Glittered out my left wrist, never been selfish
Day a nigga play with me, I swear that his death wish
My choice is codeine for my daily beverage
Ask them hoes about me, they gon' say his flavor hella sick
If I rap it then I live it, I just gave them my life
And now I'm the hottest in the city
Give me that pussy lil' mama, and I bet I kill it
Different flavor bitches, yea I'm with it
