[Intro]
It's Dolph
Paper Route Empire
You can call me LeBron

[Chorus]
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
I don't know bout them but all we smokers, DJ I'm strong
I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
My nigga I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Clip stunter in this game, you can call me LeBron

[Verse 1]
I ain't passing shit I'm shooting erythang
Pull up on me with the bullshit, watch how I let it rain
Diamonds wrapped around my wrist like I just won the championship
But I remember way back in the day when my teachers told me that I was gon never be shit
But but look at me now, check me out, I'm the shit
Too much to fit in the toilet bowl
I see a hundred million in my horoscope
I like bad bitches, I hate boring hoes
Slamming these bitches like Lebron
Skywalker OG in my lung
I touch a bitch then she come
I invite a bitch over let her hit the weed
Hit her from the back, now I think she sprung
The next day I had to put that bitch out and make that bitch go hard

[Chorus]
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
I don't know bout them but all we smokers, DJ I'm strong
I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
My nigga I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Clip stunter in this game, you can call me LeBron

[Verse 2]
'Cause 9 millie get thirty rounds
In the trunk got thirty pounds
And all over I'm loud, y'all still smoking loud
A couple of my niggas locked up, a couple of my niggas on the run
The new young nigga in the city now run shit like LeBron
Everything I got come from the streets of South Memphis
If you ain't from over here, don't get caught over here slipping
Police hating on me 'cause the streets love me like LeBron
Wasting me and my dogs tan, gotta make them pretty bucks

Call me LeBron, I'm a superstar
Blowing loud blunts in my supercharge
My championship diamonds look like ice water
I go hard, but my whole team go harder

[Chorus]
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
I don't know bout them but all we smokers, DJ I'm strong
I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Ballin hard on these niggas fuckin bitches for fun
Been doing this since I was young you can call me LeBron
My nigga I fucked yo baby mama and bought yo son some LeBron's
Clip stunter in this game, you can call me LeBron
