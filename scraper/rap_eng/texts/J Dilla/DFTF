[Verse 1: Illa J]
Date year, mid-night mating
On the dancefloor, using our imagination
Picture me with pants off
I'm confident 'cause you can't keep your hands off
Now you're sweating, I think I see some lip
Got to check for that leg, make sure you ain't got a Duck tucked, with a fist, plus knuckles
Don't take me so serious, I'm just trying to bust chuckles
You so fine, I just want to be all over your body Like that love spell
While you playing untouchable, I'm incredible
You got to be more flexible in the game
Let me buy that Boardwalk, no more small talk
I just want to do business with you
Fill each other's glass up, let's sip to you
In the passenger seat of my Bentley Coupe
Only if you my future, uhh

[Chorus: Affion Crockett]
Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
And by the end, we'll be biting and screaming
A nice evening
Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
By the end, we'll be biting and screaming, a nice evening

[Verse 2: Affion Crockett]
Baby your first mistake was looking and batting your eyelashes
You was in a dance with a dude, and I crashed it Rude
From the door you were floored by my swagger
Had your ass moist and flowing with Niagra
My eyes are Pierce Brosnan, staring deep in your soul
My James Bond pimp demeanor is cold, whoa!
You can walk and turn your back fronting
But you'll be home eating comfort food like fat woman (yummy)
I'm international don, the ace thriller
I'll be banging hard in broads smooth as J Dilla (Yancey)
You a lady singing the blues
I'm Billy Dee with the ring and the shoes
I ain't got a damn thing to lose
Take my hand 'fore it falls off, you got a choice
Say yes, makes me hard, saying no makes my balls soft
You remind me of my ex-girl, hardheaded
So I'mma run up in your sex girl, hard hit it
Yeah

[Chorus: Affion Crockett]
Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
And by the end we'll be biting and screaming
A nice evening
Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
By the end we'll be biting and screaming, a nice evening

[Verse 3: Illa J]
I hit the jumper, splash, on that ass, back in and out
Electric slide back into it
Don't be abashed when I smash, wake up get my mash
And crash in my bed butt-naked
You shouldn't drink and bone, just leave your phone
Number I will call you if you got the job
And don't be spying on my pager
Don't be lying 'bout your age I, know you probably lie about your name
A lot more, sharp than you think
Do you think? How about getting, another, drink?
Got to make a move you giving me the wink
Got to say my package weigh a lot more than you think
I see you outside, getting in the club free
Looking lovely
As soon as I seen you had wanted to fuck me
I see me and you ba-bump ba-bumping
Ba-bump ba-bump

[Chorus: Affion Crockett]
Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
And by the end, we'll be biting and screaming
A nice evening

Baby why you fighting the feeling?
With your body all nice and appealing
Baby take my hand, I'mma give you a night to believe in
By the end we'll be biting and screaming, a nice evening
