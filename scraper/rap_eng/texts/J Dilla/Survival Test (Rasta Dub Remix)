[Intro]
Once again, once again, once again, we go...
L.A., say 'Do that shit, do that shit, do it'
(Do that shit, do that shit, do it)
C'mon, say 'Do that shit, do that shit, do it'
(Do that shit, do that shit, do it)
OK, well...

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
How y'all feel out there? Let me know if it's real out there
'Cause it is out here; it's a game of survival
Niggas is trying to live out here
Round here, I watch cats hit the floor
And ain't nann Johnny Gill out here
But it's too many cowards around
My real niggas getting killed out here
It's ill out here
Busta tell you what it is out here
A whole lot of pimps, it's some live bitches out here
They liable to set you up
Man, everybody thugging out here
Narcos even drug dealing out here
Can't club, slugs peeling out there
You out here, mob with us
Get dollars is what we about here
Gotta handle your biz out there, it's too real out here
Yeah

[Scratched Samples]
("Money and blood don't mix...
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back")
("I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone")
("It's too real")
("It's how we do it out here on this underground real shit, nigga")

[Verse 2: J Dilla]
Some wannabes out here, but they outta there
Time for Dill' and Madlib out here
There's a whole lotta filth out there
Y'all can't be for real out there
Fake gangstas better chill out there
Y'all know the deal out here
It's real out here, meals out there
Niggas got bills out here
Everybody tryna live out here
Everybody hustling out here
And you don't want your biz out there
Hoes be on some bullshit out here
You don't wanna be without here
Niggas ain't giving a fuck, they will pull it out here
A bitch nigga won't kill shit, but a dumb nigga will out here
How a lotta blood get spilled out here
It's fucked up but it's real out here
Is that how it is out there?
Shit don't make sense out here

[Scratched Samples]
("Money and blood don't mix...
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back")
("Draw the street scene")
("Keepin' steel, see, niggas is false
My firepower keep me warm")

[Verse 3: J Dilla]
Going out to my crumb snatchers
Better watch your back 'cause it's real out here
When you cake and it bring the hate
You better bring the thing and it's real out here
Detroit niggas getting real out here
LA niggas getting real out here
Worldwide, let's get live at the same time and survive
Because it's real out here

[Interlude]

Yo, big money nigga
Yo, niggas don't play, holla!
Yo, you better get your shine on, nigga, before its over
