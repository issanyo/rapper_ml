[Chorus]
Friends like you don't come too often
I'm so thankful for you
We always have a good time no matter what we do
Two nights in Vegas, then hit Hawaii, nice vacation for two
Every time I wake up, I look at you and say 'I'm so thankful for you'

[Verse 1]
Check it, uh, yeah
Remember when you asked me to smoke, asked me to toke?
Said you had the best shit and I would surely get blowed
I can't reject something so perfect-ly imperfect
You happy to hang with a nigga that show you respect
I'm excited to chill with a lady who understands this music game
You always keep a joint rolled, let's blaze the flame
Always shopping, let's go to nightlife, I heard it's poppin'
Actually, we gotta buy shoes just for the Lakers game
We got the munchies and we ain't ashamed
Cinnamon pretzels, wilin' out on my assistant like threat souls
We having a sensational time
And I know that our relationship will grow in time, uh

[Chorus]
Friends like you don't come too often
I'm so thankful for you
We always have a good time no matter what we do
Two nights in Vegas, then hit Hawaii, nice vacation for two
Every time I wake up, I look at you and say 'I'm so thankful for you'

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
Remember riding to the ocean
After hittin' the weed it seems slow motion
I make a couple beats just to bump in your ride and to impress
'Cause I wanted to put my hands on them breasts
Check your temperature, here's the thermometer
Damn girl, you're so hot, you got that jungle fever
And wait 'til you see this hung ass Libra
You may be a cougar but you look like a young ass cheetah
Girl, you're so fast, but now you outta breath
I got yo' ass, I got a fast first step
Like Monta Ellis, with the rock
You can't catch me, but you got me
Uh, I'm so glad that we got we (each other)
And also I'm so glad that we got weed
Such stoners got a plant in the corner
Like Little Shop of Horrors saying 'feed me'

[Chorus]
Friends like you don't come too often
I'm so thankful for you
We always have a good time no matter what we do
Two nights in Vegas, then hit Hawaii, nice vacation for two
Every time I wake up, I look at you and say 'I'm so thankful for you'

[Outro]
Girl, I just wanna thank you, for everything that you do
'Cause I appreciate you, for real, I appreciate you
Just wanna thank you, uh, for everything that you do
Like I said, I appreciate you
Yo James, now let the music ride
