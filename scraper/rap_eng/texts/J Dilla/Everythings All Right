(Verse 1)
Take a look at the sun the day just begun
I'm feelin like I won cause don't nobody want none
My cuz used to tell me I flow way over heads
Probably why my sound was so appealing to the older heads
I used to stay up mad late just studying beats
You know the ones by j dilla that sound so sweet
When my flows be over them my bro told me that
Now my flows be so clean sometimes I don't even stack
Sometimes I be thinkin up crack you like that
Thriller like mike jack that's when you bring it back
Cause this whole verse I been talkin bout my flows
Didn't mention pushin benz sellin rocks or hoes
I also been explainin I'm next put Alaska on the map
Get stacks travel the world then get back to reality
All these women surroundin me plus i got that loud in me
Man fuck all them haters that doubted me
(Hook)
Cause everythings all right
We smokin' all right
This beat sound nice and my words are tight
This what you like? so everythings all right x3
(Verse 2)
I was rudely thinkin bout how to get to the top
Which made me think that this shit don't stop
Fuck you mean what I'm gon do after I get to my dream
Ima dream up another one make history beam out my eyes
And tell the story of a champion
Now they askin what camp he in tryna stamp me in
Under the lamp shinning like a diamond in the sunshine
Ninjas worried bout punch lines and sayin dumb lines
Now I see why it can seem that that real is hard to come by
But come find this kid from the small town of anchorage Alaska
I'm tryna make classics you tryna make hits fasta I'm the master
Controller of the ceremony
So how dare you compare me to rappers that phony
Pick up the phone on jabronis when they walk up
Always wanna talk stuff when they really know they washed up
Actin like they all tough you weak emcees is not us
And we proceed to live on even after we die
You might be after the wrong prize what's on your mind
Surprise to come find out the world is all a game
And most people worried bout being the same
So be different be you be cool in your own way
And work hard trust me one day you gon play
(Hook)
Cause everythings all right
We smokin' all right
This beat sound nice and my words are tight
This what you like? so everythings all right x3
