Loui_D back with these impact lyrics
Rhymes stretch like field goals when I kick it
Tall girls say I'm 2 short like a couple midgets
But I'll take it down like a lumberjack get it
Yelling timber when them legs start giving in
And have her collapse like the walls up in Berlin
I keep these skills to tweak these chicks out purposely
The Paramedics on deck for emergency
Cause you got to be aware of them accidents
And no I don't affiliate myself with abstinence
Switching up the techniques when I'm stabbing it
She lovin' the steez so she want to be my advocate
Cause she see the style gleaming like a winner's ring
And represent the nigga that's scoring slamin' the ding-a-ling
And tell her friends to keep hatin'
Cause I aggressively put it on her like a tough situation
Is like a photo shoot cause she thinkin' I'm a poser
She thought wrong when I smashed it like a heavy boulder
Did you get it (it is over)
My written's so legit I wanna get a poster
She said I was correct but I regret I told her
Cause my flow is running better with a second motor
And keep it going like I'm up drinking hella foulders
I'm dodging my hater using my head and shoulders
Creating my own orbit using Hella solar
Propelling the generation with them iller bangers
Keep the flow mashin' on the beat Like Dilla's finger
