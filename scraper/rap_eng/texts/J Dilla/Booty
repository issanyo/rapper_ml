[Verse 1]
Your booty might be bigger
But I still can pull your nigga
But I don't want him
You got sugar on your pita
But your nigga thinks I'm sweeter
But I don't want him
You know the whole encyclopedia
But your nigga thinks I'm deeper
But I don't want him
Got a whole lot a junk off in your trunk
But your nigga think I'm live and I keep him crunk
I don't want him

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey
I don't want him, cause of what he's doing to you
And you don't need him, cause he ain't ready
See I don't want him
If he ain't made no arrangement with you
I hope you would've done the same thing for me too

[Verse 2]
Your kisses might be wetter
But your nigga likes mine better
But I don't want him
You got the beans and rice and the hot ho-cakes
But your nigga still over here in my plate
I don't want him
You got a PhD, Magna Cum Laude
But your nigga love me with a GED
I don't want him
You the one with all the money
And he knows my money's funny
But I don't want him

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey
I don't want him, cause of what he's done to you
And you don't need him, cause he ain't ready
See I don't want him
If he ain't made no arrangement with you
And you don't need him, cause the boy ain't ready

[Verse 3]
Got your pad all decked out fo' sho'
But your nigga's at my door, though
But I don't want him
Well you can do the butterfly and the tootsie roll
But your nigga straight sprung off the way I stroll
I don't want him
You know the whole 120 and a plus degree
But you can't keep your God up off his knees
I don't want him
You got a nine-to-five and a six-to-ten
But your nigga told me not to work again
I don't want him

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey
See, I don't want him, cause of what he's doing to you
And you don't need him, cause he ain't ready
See I don't want him
If he ain't made no arrangement with you
I hope you would've done the same thing for me too
