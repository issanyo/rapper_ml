U know [ u know]

Ur my baby, i only act shady
But it's time to cut an hour
Girl

And u know i'm (workin on it)
I said i'm (workin on it)
U know (workin on it)

And i want right here in
My world being withchu all
Alone is so inspiring
With that said i'm on my
Way back to the ab to get {workin on it}

U clain that you need me
Girl u tryna play me
And you im gonna want
You back in my arms

But you know that (only on can win)
So u betta think twice cause
You may never find..
(i never felt a love like this)
On the forever beat dont get it
Twisted cause "b" stands for baby
