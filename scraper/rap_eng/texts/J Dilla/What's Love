I know a girl named rhythm and I choose to keep her close
Sheâ€™s got a younger sister named tempo
And I swear that I love em both
I enjoy them the same the pleasure shared is equal
They're major parts of my life I put them above some people
They treat me just right I swear they're all I'll ever need
A part of my mind body and soul for them I'd even bleed
When I wake up in the morning they're never out of reach
They accompany me throughout my days
And even when I sleep
The realest girls I've ever known they've never done me wrong
They've been by my side when I've been weak
And helped to make me strong
They remind me to hold on and weather the storm
They help me clear my head
And make it right whenever I've done wrong
They make my body move and heartbeat rise
They take me to better place above the clouds in the sky
They know how to bring out the best of me
They have the recipe they'll be by my side even as I rest in peace

1,2,1,2 What's love?
This love right here

1,2,1,2 What's love?
Love is what I'm kicking in your ear (you feel it)

Through the years we've grown together and the feelings still remain
Our relationship is the same even though they've seen me change
I can be myself whenever I'm in their company
They're ever so inviting they help me to live comfortably
They have an effect on my brain that I can't explain
I've learned to enjoy the cool breeze when it rains
Even the longest of days come to an end
And at the end of my days I know I'll always have some friends
Who are there when I need them they're always down to listen
They provide the cure better than any prescription
I could never over dose the more I have the better I feel
A lot in life is fake, but my love for them is real
So never question what I pursue in life
I'm living easy with rhythm and tempo and everything's alright
If you know them as well and they're important to you
Treat em right because they fuel everything I do

Music makes me feel like I'm a part of something real
Soundscapes and imagery through the speakers give me chills
Percussion and bass lines redefine thoughts inside my mind
And make me feel alive within these hard times
The hard times that we all face that's reality
The beats per minute help to lighten up the gravity
And pressure off my back it helps me to relax
Bringing it back to jazz samples with smooth sax
Making a splash through the sound waves
Feeling vibrations on my skin like the sun during the summer days
Music and haze keeps me well behaved
Take my emotions and put them on page where they forever stay
Cause from time to time my thoughts like to run away
Some days I don't how to act or find the words to say
What should be easy for me to piece together
Music fuck a 16 this is a love letter
