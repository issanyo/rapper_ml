Verse:
(Uh)
I burnt my tongue on a coffee
I was gonna tell you I love you
But this bittersweet taste of regret don't go with toffee

My caramel dripped in your cream, ya nah mean?

My cinnamon soaked and it marinates
Your steam seeped through a seem and let out a  scream as it serenades

Well, I guess this is "Good Morning"
But the language of love that you are speaking is so foreign

Let me know just where you want it
I'll perform there like I'm touring

No cryin on my shoulder without warning
It ain't Ralph, though the garments that you
Wearing are allurin'

I burnt my tongue on a coffee
I bit my lip on a peach

I've been told to practice what you preach
I got an appetite for you you've got an appetite for me



Hook:
And baby, I know (I know)
Something that you donâ€™t (you don't)
I know that you don't, ever doubt me

And baby I know, (I know, say what)
Something that you won't (You won't, say what)
I know that you won't, forget about me


Outro:
(Talk To Me Baby)
(Talk To Me Baby)
(Talk To Me , Talk To Me, Talk To Me Baby)
(Talk To Me Baby)
