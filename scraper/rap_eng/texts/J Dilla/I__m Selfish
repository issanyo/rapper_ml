Hit me hard with the lips on me
Caught me so off guard red like roses
And my friends saw our first kiss
Oh

Fell so deep
Everybody noticed
Though I try to resist
Baby you are, baby you are...

Ever since I met you what I think of love has changed
Made me question my perception everything was rearranged
And I try to fight it I don't wanna put you through no pain
When I tell you that I need a man again

Guess that, I'm selfish, I'm sorry
Can't help it need that body
Won't be here forever
Come get it now or never

Hit me hard
Oh, yeah!

Girl you're like a summer in the midst of all the rain
Since the day I got your number you been running round my brain
And I try to fight it I don't wanna put you through no pain
And I'll tell you that I need a man again
Oh

I'm selfish, I'm sorry
Can't help it need that body
Won't be here forever
Come get it now

With your lips on me, caught me so off guard
