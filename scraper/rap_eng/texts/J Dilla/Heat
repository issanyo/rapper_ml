[Scratching]:
"Real Detroit hip hop"

J Dilla {x8}

[Verse One]:
Start to finish, get the image of a hustla
Paint it just like a shop like when they talk to Carhart and disassemble a body
Like a mechanic with car parts
Introducin' a man with his hands everywhere like Calamari, now march with me
Be a needle we need you to get in the groove
Don't sleep, keep it rollin', I'm a trucker, live in Michigan
But Chili never been in my vocab like Usher
Won't change even with the Aftermath like Busta
Keep a low profile, hard to notice in a crowd
But I know you know I know you know the style
A wild nigga with crowd control
Hard as a cadet with tear gas
Don't, on that Patti Labelle shit
I did it on my own, underground like I'm speakin' through a manhole
I'm also big enough to start a Barry Bonds scandal
I drop hard as a Looney Toon anvil
Your career's short as Emanuel, come and get your manual and so
How he manage to grow so cold?
So many shoulders at a show like Detroit outdoors
And if this morning you can handle, get your hands up
Off the wall and your mouth off the floor
What you waitin' for?
Feel it

[Hook]:
Street ?
My heat spark off the charts
A man on a mission
Here we come y'all
HEAT
You know the spot rusher, hot busta
Quick, duck for cover
Here come another, keep it hard
Bangin' in your system
This inner vision of a prophet I spit
Here we come y'all
HEAT
Here we come y'all
HEAT

[Verse Two]:
Hop on board of my train of thought
The art of takin' pain was taught
Before I was eatin' solid food I could talk
Walk where they got chains on their naked hands
Jammin' in a panel of your ride, feet dipped in animal hide
I'm here to change that
It's a new day and you know it, even Ma$e came back
Subtract my thought
It's damn near spiritual
And my bars like a physical
You lift and I cough
No words, just life
Your image is through a mic
No ice just nice
It's like God got me goin' through a job interview
I'm a three year long song and goin', you an interlude
Some of y'all niggas funny with rap
So can I say I'm feelin' this?
Sayin' you ball more like Jason Williams fumblin' with your gat
Don't get in trouble with that
How subtle was that?
Hollywood Shufflin' cats continue to act
They wouldn't make the crew cut if they worked at the Gap
I'm a local they know I'm loco with vocals
Smooth with dolo it's unbelievable like Iraqi abuse photos
Who really get raw?
The pen mightier than the sword I'm swingin' to your ears
Finally open, you know what I'm fightin' for

[Hook]:
Street ?
My heat spark off the charts
A man on a mission
Here we come y'all
HEAT
You know the spot rusher, hot busta
Quick, duck for cover
Here come another, keep it hard
Bangin' in your system
This inner vision of a prophet I spit
Here we come y'all
HEAT
Here we come y'all
HEAT

[Verse Three]:
With the street been sweet niggas ? deep in the seat
Same spot, tryin' to plot, cause your life don't repeat
And you reap what you sow (let's grow!)
All day stompin', I'm Greek step show off Broadway
I stay cooler than Chris Walken
The reason my city raw like Edo G to Boston
Every show take offering
In 8th grade you're coughin' up your mother with the coffin
Fall victim to the author when it's awkward she applaudin'
When I'm ?
Spit trouble so hard, think I'm double ?
Knowin' God load 'em on ?
Sober like a nigga who know he ?
But tryin' to cover body odor before ?
Flood the game so heavy
South Asia look like a puddle in the park
Leave a mark like two preteens makin' hickey's in the dark
Padlock your door like Joe Clark, exit closed off

"When I say J, y'all day Dilla!"
"J"
"Dilla!"
"J"
"Dilla!"
