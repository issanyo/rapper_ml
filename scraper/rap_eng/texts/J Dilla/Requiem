[Verse 1: Andre Wisdom]
I Might Be The Chosen One
But That Don't Mean Im The Only One
Its 7 Billion Motherfuckas On This Earth
& You Still Tryna Figure Out Your Worth?
It Ain't In Following The Crowd
Be Original
Stop Biting The Trending Style
Enjoy The Moments For Now
We Don't Have That Long To Live
My Message To The Youth Is Enjoy Being A Kid
My Cuzzo Told Me Its Hard As Shit
Sometimes He Wish He Didn't Exist
Trapped In The Trap With No Exit
Can't Go Legit
Ain't Enough Employment Down This Bitch
But I Believe In You
Trust Me Dj Its Something I See In You
You Supposed To Make It!
Damn Cuzzo I Think I See It Too
Emotions Coming Soon
But Thats Another Discussion
These Police Beat Us Down
Even Into Concussions
Shooting Us In The Back
Cops White Or Black?
Its a War On Mentality
Im Just Stating The Fact's
They Promoting BullShit
To Bring Down The Art Of Rap
But As Long As They Recognize The Art Official (Artificial)
I Ain't Mad
Love Is Love
Unconditional I Provide It
My Perspective On Progression Undecided
We Could Try Anyways
At Least We Be United
Fuck All The Politics
Lets Put All That Shit Behind Us!
