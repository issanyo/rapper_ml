Lauren Nine - "Hip-Hop Queen" lyrics

[Verse 1]
Here I come switch all the cameras or phones all the people staring at me
Clap your hands everybody brake the floor like it ain’t nobody
Cause it’s a party night scene
I see the roof getting the groove the walls shaking ( booty shaking yeah botty shaking )
The queen is on the hause get down for her blessing ( for her blessing get down for her blessing)

Bust it , blowing minds slowly, wicked steps gon' make you feel dirty
We all have a blast classic shit for the class ( classic music )
I hope you're on the level cause hip-hop ain't no joke
Step into the ghetto cause this shit is getting hot
Common funky, eye candy, she's so hunky
Let it grind
Now it's about that time fellas
Get closer and feel the hype
DJ scratch this hit , grab the plate make it creep
Cheers, we gone hit the town cause the queen is sounding around
We gon' hit the town, cause the Queen is sounding around

[Chorus]
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Let it ride, let it ride, ride

[Verse 2]
Staring at the crowd all the people shout aloud
All I can do is show my proud
And a little bit of a good day when I go out cause

I can't keep grooving is my movement and I beg it on yeah
I feel the warm air in my face is all I need to go forward , hey , hey

[Verse 3]
My hood my mood no problems
Blueprint in the room for dozens
Kings and queens on the main stage
I feel your soul not your golden heritage
Face to face and she pass on by
History of music and a lot of lifes
She sleeps thru the spirit and bring us soul
Bring us the healing for the poison of our none

[Bridge]
I know you had problems in the past but feel it , feel it
I know complexions ride our lives but forget them, forgive them
Let her inside your mind, when we listen to her we all the same kind
Of hip-hop so make way cause...

[Chorus]
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Here comes the Queen
(here comes the queen here here comes the queen)
Let it ride, let it ride, ride
