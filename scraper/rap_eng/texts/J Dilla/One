Inspired by exceptions to the rules
Those who made it out
Waiting for the day I can resume
Assume the crutch that I've been leaning on to get me out the room in which I'm stuck in
I've sunk and plus I'm hazy from the fumes
I am gravity. Grounded in my grip is my surroundings
Kind of close out all my friends so I don't blame them if they're mad at me
Talk about a travesty then chalk this up a masterpiece
The latter of my savage days portrayed my bling as Saturn rings
Waxing over 30 bars to carve my name on mountain peaks
Though when in doubt retreat but that's as likely as one scouting me
Instilling utter fear in those who see through what their scouter reads
It's over Nine thousand times a number that is out of reach
For show & tell I brought a picture of my heart
And made a list of all components that made it turn cold and dark
Start your engines for questions. I'll answer them all
Then afterwards walk out the room proclaiming clever remarks
The Siamese cat theme plays when I grab a pen
Cos that is when depth of me ascends to make mics bend
Then right then and there to compare to the happy me
Is that grim side and that half is Son Anthony
Shake rattle roll. Toll paid up via words
My celestial body is present while here on earth
Stain glass apparition through a flashback vision
Made a sane citizen backpack through the pixels
The gates now lifted. Let the ideas settle
Hell was such a subtle ride and I deride the under-leveled
And my valentine is gone. So long to the one
Now I arise each day the same time as the sun does
