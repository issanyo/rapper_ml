We bout to get it, lyrics flippin' don't forget it
Swift rippin', plus a nigga's artistic when he spit it
Yes the poetic professor left an impression
Never regretting embedding the evidence of progression
Stepping it up when teaching a lesson
Keeping then guessing and questioning in reference of me flopping
In this recession
I never stress the blessings in this essence of time
Whenever it steps in, then i'll inherit a better grind
And i will cherish the time grinding, finding divine
Rhymes to confine to paper lines demonstrating the none violence
Passion for rap,attack tracks with the dagger the rap hacker
With the rapture to match with the swagger
Don't forget the flow's evolved with a purpose the flows swervin'
Eager to master the track with no cursing
I ain't got no time to carry a load of the burdens
In all seriousness cause my shoulder muscles is hurtin'
But i'm hype to create a diversion,the gift of the lyrical facts
Got em feelin' the heat like a serpent
I'm bout to turn it up in environments that is urban
And spit on the butter beats and then turn the heads of the lurkers
Skills of a skater who irk the nerves of a city worker
Catching attention with ease and sharp with gillette verses
And face off with the track like a fight poster
And then i finish this mission with the right toaster
And make sure i keep these strategies in store here
And execute these plans with this lyrical modern warfare
