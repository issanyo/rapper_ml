Verse 1 - Napoleon Da Legend
It’s the God of the anthems bar champion
Disregarding the slander
God sent gargantuan highly regarded y’all been bitter
Since the umbilical been writing my shit no Quentin Miller
Revealing the real like the Matrix trilogy
Knowledge this imagery acrylic on a Dilla beat you feel it
Modern citizen no cynicism I make moves that stay immune
To criticism vilified like a movie villain when I kill it
Yo I gotta get it I rep for the poverty stricken
Peace to my drunk uncle probably drinking
And to these fronting ass rappers who be probably tricking
Struggling to pull a chick at a show the thirst real
You better off probably dry-humping the third rail
That’s a light shot that’ll make your ego bleed
We at the crib watching highlights from the Negro League
While y’all dapping in the trap and adapting to the fads
I was jabbing in the bag splash it on the map
Quite flashy in fact what you chat you attract
Snuck in the back with admin her abdomen was flat
Endorsement deals floating
My way they staring at the clothes
I wear going after me at shows is not fair
I promised my pops I’m a do the most while I’m here
I ate the star like Mario there’s no one I fear
Hey yo

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend
From the top of the key I score buckets
Midcourt when the buzzer go off I score buckets
Baseline fade-away 3 I score buckets
Guaranteed when you mention my name they gonna love it
Splash brother

Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend
God body sharp off your bodyguard art
They saw your heart was missing after the autopsy y’all
Hard body thoughts send your party regards
Another body drops that’s just part of the job
It’s martial arts ménages at the Taj Mahal
Whoever got the juice turns into a target y’all
Swing twice around the block when I’m parking the car
And when it’s on put razors to backs like Arkansas
I’m level 60 records you be putting out is Frisbees
Mount Rushmore of rap put him right next to Biggie
Dissect that you can buy where I sell at
And if your energy is off my mind will detect that
Walter White potency you find in a Meth Lab
What’s in the dark comes to light I shine when it’s jet black
Putting it down for my city I’m fighting off jet lag
Taking L’s part of life but I don’t accept that

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend
