[Chorus]
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you

[Verse 1]
And here we go again, we get out and get back
Career criminals, socialize with the media
You shooting out subliminals, see what that ' do
All the lies you thought were true
All the girls you thought I'd put in line in front of you
Boo hoo your eyes out, you who you cry about?
I would just pack up my issues and ride out
Lights out, doors closed, everybody going home
Home is where the art is but you make my home a war zone
Zone out to this shit, sink and sadistic
Every convo turn into a session girl, I'm twisted
It's time to lift it off and change my arena
I'm in Russia, I'mma rush out with the prima ballerina
Clearer than Seraphina, richer than Rich Medina
You had a bigger problem, you let bigotry between you
You dealing with giants, it's Jack and the beanstalk
You thought you had a set of balls now watch me walk
'Cause that's four balls and I need my extra basis
You used to love it, now I need 100 paces
Let's face it, we won't make it, it's like that

[Chorus]
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you

[Verse 2]
Yo, I thought I would take you to momma
Cook up some of that, boo, we loving that
But we far from that, I mean, I mean we can just talk for that
Deal with no strings attached, yes, I'm cool with that
When you're free I'll take care of that
But I must admit, thought you were it, now it's time to quit all of the games
But I see no change so we can bang
Your hit, no thing, mami, ain't no ring
Did my phone ring? Hold up
It's top, I'm 'bout to drop another blizzard
I'm 'bout to take you on a ride that's bizarre
And when I seek out the thing I make all the bitches scream
They get their sun's out like a lizard
Except for you ' I knew something was missing from my life
And it was you, how do I get into the mind of mis-confused
Miss Rubik's is driving me insane as I twist to kill
Are other rumors true about you? Kissing dudes for cash and jewels
Cameras in the action loose, status in the ashes, no, new face, new attitude
Wake up and I'm mad at you, I don't want that, neither do you
Either we chose to get together now or either we lose
I still love you ' I picture you as my mistress blowing kisses
Hope you get this, hope you hear this, hope you feel this
Ain't your spirit, I'm sincere here, I am here, here for you
This is true, I threw it for you

[Chorus]
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you
Thought you would fall in my arms instead of falling in love
You're just here for the charm
It will be cool, I mean we will be fine
You can get yours but I gotta get mine
And I still be loving you
I still be loving you
