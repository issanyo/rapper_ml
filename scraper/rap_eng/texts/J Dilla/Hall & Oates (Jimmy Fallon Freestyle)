This version we doing is called Hall and Oates, aka This Is It
Rest in peace, Dilla

[Verse]
They ask me for advice, so what's it gon' be
I treat it like I'm preachin' to a young me
Tell myself that you about to be like Jon B
Ummm scratch that, John Lennon, now you're on key
Left-handed lay-ups with your pops in the street
Makin' drums so college girls try to dance in the jeep
Keep the good beats for yourself, keep a stash full of treats
And the cover of The Fader don't put ass in the seats, uh
Realize the gifts that you've been given
Make you deadly in the kitchen
That's LeBron with Curry's pull-up
Pop records for your digits
The rhythm sense is lifted
The whiteness is intended, they'll never mention privilege
That's the wrong tree to bark up
A willow with the whispers
Stay away from one oak, you'll get the redwood from a mistress
That's a packed line, back's fine
Island's on your shoulder but it's snack time
Eat, collect your publishing and act right
Eat, collect your publishing and act right
Eat, collect your publishing and act right
Eat, collect your publishing and act right
