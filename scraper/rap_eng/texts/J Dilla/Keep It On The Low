Know I'm the streets, you see me hanging with the hood dwellers
Mister pimp hanging with the good fellows in the neighborhood
It could the wallers, things is getting smaller
From this 20, get over it's hard
I used to know a nigga from back in the gat
He steady with the shit, while...rap man
It ain't no time to slap walk
Now try and hunger...west chillin backboards
The real niggas look the skills, know the deal
That's the way we pack mills to make a fuckin livin
Around the way oh, I strive to be famous
You wanna hear some shit, put your ear upon my anus
I take you to places that you never been before
You wanna chill but you still gonn be hardcore
Legends of the same race minds, why waste time
Niggas wanna put 9's on they waist line
Define my time, inside my mind, I got freestyle for day
So I make dope, they came in to ... my domain
So remember my sign is ill, but I try to keep it on the real
Come to the hood but still

Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low
Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low
You gotta keep it, keep it
Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low
Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low

Hey yo, do you through the same thang daily
Getting plaid by your lady, have a baby on the bakely
And I'm my brother's keeper
I'm the only nigga in the hood, not distracted by a zebra
So around the way they all callin
With the same type of thangs...
Shooting at the gas man, unload the gun
Found chopped up in the trash can
Niggas don't understand, the way the master plan
The way the genocide, but I hop in my mercide
All the ...to kill another brother, in the summer
My mind is getting run over by the numbers
And that's the way it is on the real
I look at the hood, come through but still

Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low
Keep it on the go, the go, go
Keep it on a down low

Hey yo, my hood, my home, little man pack...
Now she watch the back, bend over, leave a mess
My niggas from the day, need to smack this
Smack me up for a buck, nothing but a crack head
Ever it was a hotty,... and put aids in her body
So now our little baby gonna grow up sick
Catch a cold and die... help yourself
