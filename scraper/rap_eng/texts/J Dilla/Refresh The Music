[VERSE]

3 Months since I heard my voice through these beats
God knows I make this music in my sleep
If I could This nigga I would cause this rap is my love
C-inc yo chase what u think am good ???
Yeah got my real friends missing me
Back When I was tryna hit on Brittany
I was in Europe trying to get the mula up
Business transfers now we tryna make it double up
I don't want it all I just want enough
I believe but they don't believe us
Life is amazing so I thank Jesus
Paris on the A1 riding in the prius
Rap king but I need crown
Just a few bad girls who's gonna hold it down
Use the quarters for the papers and the base
Hydro then I blow This weed smoke in her face sky high
I'm tryna get it right only got one life so

[HOOK]

Refresh the music it's bin a while now we gotta do it
Dj just keep crowd moving
Light up the dutch push start and we cruising
