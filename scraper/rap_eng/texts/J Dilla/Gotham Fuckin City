[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]

Rare nigga
We in the building, so whoever else here, I got nair don't come near nigga
Be clear nigga, I don't fuck with squares or do square business
Business is business as usual
Rather deal with labels than live in a cubicle
That's what a few rap checks will do to you
Life is beautiful, Gettin' it poppin'
Cold in new york, fly where it's hot yea I got options
My mom named me after connery, rep gotham city honorably
To not fuck with me is anomaly, What nigga
You gotta be buggin' bottom line, no denying me cousin
No time for the fussin', well unless I can give you a dozen
Wordplay dope, lyrics is krills
Bring both worlds together, Nucky Thompson for real
Discussing biz with my bro from the ville
Like "Aye Say, niggas tryin' to build"
Be cool.....

[Interlude]
Guy 1: How you got that money, you holdin
Guy 2: you know me man,? I don't think you know me man you know what I'm saying you just gotta end up believing me you know what I mean
Guy 1: ahh c'mon man!

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]

Uh, Uh...
These niggas ain't ready for a global shift in paradigm
Life's a gamble need my own pair of dice this time
All I ask is for friends without parasitic minds
But that's as seldom as Paris city crimes
They donâ€™t wanna see me eat, they feeding of my vibe, Rations of pride depleting them inside when they sleep
See I don't mind sharing mines cuz the sun shines
Through my sheer white blinds, it's all I really need sometimes
A little, light to spark through the darkness
Because this glory road ain't always to bright for artists
Especially when you encounter a carcass
Like "damn, life's a bitch and that bitch ain't even barking"
They ask me how I do it, I don't really plan it
Let it flow organic, plus the flow is all granite
No grammatical errors in the conglomerate era
No time for setbacks cause we all on to the better
