[Intro]
Andrew

Another perspective to shape

A new world to create

Everything reacts

And makes an impact

Let's go



[Verse 1]
The system dismissive
So intentions, prolific
Never twisted, just different
Not ignorant, my temperament
Is intricate, I enter this, with vividness
My voice as the instrument, or whether it
Be raining, not straining, or complaining
Just gaining, aspiration, and patience
Absorbing, portions, no distortions
According, to portraits, the vivid, way to
Live it, is living, past the limits, inventive
And sufficent, no interference we appearing
Clearly, some need to start mirroring, mind clearing
Find freedom, your sure to see it, start repeating
Don't go by treason, see were all that even

[Hook]
Shift your mind
To find design
Just lift and unwind

No matter the climb
Continue the strive
We all gotta fly

[Verse 2)
Let me construct something new, brought the proper tools, to shape it smooth, always prepared to move, through the obstacles I pursue, Andrew, and I will stand too, the oppressive, with lessons, will not lessen, electric, static shocking connections, enough oppression, and suppression, some don't see the problem as reflection, some look back with no direction, need some light here's projection, for your spectrum, some haunted, in the darkest, compartment, without a target, or guidance, providence, something to strive with, alignments, assignment, not that violence, or whining we gotta stay climbing

[Hook]
Shift your mind
To find design
Just lift and unwind

See We all gotta fly

[Verse 3]
Yo check it
The schooling be, foolery, I use the beam, to open scenes, and
Choosingly, doing what I do to be, my eulogy, unusually, not musically
Or few can see, this idenity, my enity, endlessly, flows throughout
This century, no misery, this chemistry, is mixing, prescription, some medicine
Intelligence, every single element, is relevant, makes us relevant
And settled in, meddling, you should be editing, developing through the way you see
Everything, because all is all, because all in all we do evovle and solve as long as we know that we are gods

[Hook]
Shift your mind
To find design
Lift and unwind

No matter the climb
Continue the strive
See we all gotta fly


[Verse 4]
Fuck the politics, they call us communists when we just want some honoring, it's all indoctrinate, walking in, abolishment, a nonsensical option when, the world awaits you, only your own choices can betray you, thoughts are fatal, don't portray those, negative ones to enable, unstable, stay faithful but it's all in you, some get caught in religion and it swallows you, just follow truth, and don't trust tomorrow too, it's all about now, to allow, the inner cloud, to dissipate, and break the formulated gates, and chains, to change, the unexplained, and what remains
