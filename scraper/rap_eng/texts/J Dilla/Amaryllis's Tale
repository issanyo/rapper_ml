[Verse 1]
Once upon a time bleeding amarilys the fool
Wondering how come love could make her feel so full
And then from A to B could ever make her feel so dull
Unconditional love can appear to feel so cruel
Now where you at my love?
Surely dancing all night showing love to other doves
Left me in the coldest forest with no ceiling above
I couldn’t see the stars I ran around and than I got lost
Funny how the strongess’ piece end up alone
Never wanted to play the game but you created one
It ain’t easy knowing your king chessing on other pawns
When he was supposed to protect you now matter what might come
So what was I for you? A phase just out the blue
And why you kept me by your side? You never had a clue
You think you scared of love I think you mostly scared of you
You promised, I believed, now I’m the dumb one true?
Hey guess I could never hate it
You were my fav part of the day my nights with you were a heaven
All them plans I made for us while you would live so oblivious
I’ve seen the signs lied to myself when it was so damn obvious
It is the time spent on your rose that makes it so important
I have to let you go in love no bitter taste oesophagus
That shooting star up in the sky definitely change something in us
Praying you find true love this the reason I hiatus
True love is the reason I hiatus
Do I hate us? Nah

[Hook 1]
In a million years of time
I just wanted you to smile
With or without me, well fuck this
I guess that we both learn our lesson
In a million years of time
I just wanted you to smile
With or without me, well fuck this
I guess that we both gonna learn the lesson love
I guess that we both gonna learn the lesson love

[Verse 2]
Now it’s time to grow
Now it’s time to know
Now it’s time to go, 1, 2, 3, 4
Now it’s time to grow
Now it’s time to know
Now it’s time to go, 1, 2, 3, 4
Now it’s time to grow
Now it’s time to know
Now it’s time to go, 1, 2, 3, 4
Now it’s time to grow
Now it’s time to know
Now it’s time to go

[Hook 2]
I just wanted you to smile
With or without me, well fuck this
I guess that we both gonna learn the lesson love
I guess that we both gonna learn the lesson love
