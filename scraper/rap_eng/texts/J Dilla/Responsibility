I want to lose control
I want to do something nasty
Baby, let's lose control
I love it when you get at me
Baby, let's lose control
Maybe just drums and wrap me
Baby, let's lose control
Baby, let's lose control
Baby, let's lose control

See, I use my soul. And I lost it to ladies in the industry that used my control against me. So, baby, make me tenderly get rid of me when I use my soul. Use the globe, UFO, turn it against me, once again. So when you turn around and you against me with your end I can go against it until I get to the end of your walls. We could be reaching the end of it all. I'm the star of DOOM. I'm staring with you. Aliens are all I need to groom. They're the reason I groom, too. And I need to be into voodoo even deeper to keep them. They're into voodoo and I see what the reason is. I love you and breathe in the jizz of my lady-ness
The goddess within me is spitting craziness to the God within you. See, we're making love now. Think about taking love down. And that's the sacred touch, now. I hope you love it. It's SEGA, what up now?

You hear me mumbling to get you. I'm running with you and I'm coming when you kiss me. I'm like a virgin. My Girl. Vader. SEGA. You all my girls, see you later. When I close my eyes and dream about Beta Future. That nigga could be a hater but you're all I've got and you've got all my data. Hot, but later. Hot, but skater. Avril Lavigne ass mad at me in fact. Because I'm such a skater boi. She should see you later boy. Then she try to bag me I don't know because I'm a hater, boy. Wait up boy, I need to stay up late for girls. Because they know what I do when I make up in my world. I'm the Creator of my world and shit. You could be living in my world in this bitch. Keep stepping like Kells in here. Because I'm so selfish. Here we go, whoa
