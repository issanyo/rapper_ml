Quick shout out to Mikey B
He asked for one, so he's got it

[Verse]
Yo
From the jump there was an ominous decent
Above the heads that can't recover from the domino effect
I went ahead to make it known that islanders cannot connect
If isolation is the preference of the person I've assessed
The edifice of my nature stems from lifetimes over
There was pleasure, there was pain which we can run through an ANOVA
Oh the passage which invokes a type a sadness has me flummoxed
I chose music over Xanax. There's a knot still in my stomach
But to overcome incertitude alludes us to the summit of the trouble
You could either face it head on or just run from it
It's getting way harder now to strive for a goal in our lives
That we are not really willing to die for
Vexed how the way that a day concludes
It goes to over to underused time
My minds abused
I trust you. Well trusted is a better word to use
That time past like the days I would kill to view again
