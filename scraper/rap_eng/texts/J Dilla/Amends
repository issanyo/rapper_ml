[Intro: Hayden Napolitano]
12 miles per hour, let's go

[Hook]
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
And I'm sick, and I'm tired, of all these fake friends
And I'm sick of the cops, looks like they're back again
Soon enough, you'll see me up there, on CNN
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
And I'm sick, and I'm tired, of all these fake friends
And I'm sick of the cops, looks like they're back again
Soon enough, you'll see me up there, on CNN

[Verse]
I've been stuck in this cycle that they call depression
Apparently I'm sad, and I show too much aggression
But apparently it's all just for attention
So I turn to the paper, writing songs is my obsession
I've been stuck in this loop, it's a cycle everyday
This shit feels like an instant replay
Tryna figure this out like I'm CIA
These thoughts in my head always seem to be gray
Be my guardian angel, cause I need to be saved
Too many times, that I've been betrayed
Thoughts getting deeper, like they in a cave
Making bad decisions, like I'm digging my own grave

[Hook]
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
And I'm sick, and I'm tired, of all these fake friends
And I'm sick of the cops, looks like they're back again
Soon enough, you'll see me up there, on CNN
