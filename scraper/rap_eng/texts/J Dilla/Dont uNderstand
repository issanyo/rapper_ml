The first line is all I need
After that it flows, allowed by the beat
Listen, the music, getting used to the blues
Rhyming's like a blues clue
Tapping mental's rapping issues
I feel like a person with passion carrying pistols
The music hits you, paying dues
I got Free Time, read between the lines
Emancipation oak smoke, proclamation to the young folk
Vision like the films, music felt like colors
Sometimes in my mind I just wonder
Sometimes with my rhymes i just blunder
Sometimes when its cold, I be thinking bout summer
Sometimes when its hot, I can't wait for fall to start
Sometimes I wanna come-up, living each day in the spring time

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I look like you, sometimes I'm black sheep
Sometimes Im up dreaming, sometimes I count sheep
Sometimes I get comfortable, sometimes I can't sleep
Sometimes Im using Reason, sometimes I rap on beats
Sometimes I can't stop, sometimes I stop to prove I can

Peace!
