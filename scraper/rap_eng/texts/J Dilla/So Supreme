"The whole world's looking at me
If I fulfill my destiny
Watching and waiting to see
The whole world's looking at me
Watching and waiting to see
If I fulfill my destiny
The whole world's looking at me" - Busta Rhymes

[Hook]:
"I feel so supreme" - Busta Rhymes

[Verse One]:
It goes finally, finally, finally I'm feeling like
Rapping fiends, magazines, human beings are see my
Passion for, spazzing on, half my songs
Killing mics, look at them, they alright
Look at me, this is life
This is death, this is real
Mixtape, this is not
People thought, critics talked
Some had heard I was dropped
Hated on, waiting on, wanna see if I'mma stop
I'mma flop, watch how I, Transform, Autobots
Roll out, told y'all, I flow Optimus
Prime style, rhyme style, one half optimist
The other half pessimist, MC nemesis
This is my Genesis
Better yet Exodus
Wait no, Exorcist
Only exception is
I make your head turn
When will y'all just learn?
Stimuli who?
You can't criticize truth
This is real what I do
Your favorite spitter times two
I feel

[Verse Two]:
I'm rich, bitch
I ain't gon' mention the recession no more
Saying so long to the
Days that sound like I'm down cause I'm up
Got drinks going round and around, got my cup
Held high
Look at me, look at you
I'm animated, but you a cartoon
Like He-Man, Thundercats, G.I. Joe, Voltron
Avatar, Superfriends, Care Bears, Pokemon
Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Boondocks
Call me King Of The Hill, don't ask "Who's hot?"
I hit the club and blow steam
I got more fans than your favorite pro team
I'm a Timberwolf, Giant, Cavalier, Warrior
Flier than an Eagle, Cardinal, Orioles
Lion, Tiger, Bear
Y'all look scared and I know it ain't fair
I don't care I feel so supreme
