Rage and love hold hands where I'm from
Slow dance where I'm from
Flow advanced in the summer time
Crushing hard in their pre-adolescence
Rage ran out of essence
And then ran out of breath and then
Love was like, "You can have some of mine."
On the double time
Releasing one another from a troubled mind
It's no wonder why this co-existence has survived
Their adoration for each other seems so foreign to the onlooker
They don't understand the depth they've been through
All the circumstances that they had to sift through
A gift, true, who would've thought they'd ever go together
You would think these two would be at each other's throats forever
But no matter what transpired
Couldn't even try to hide
The connection inside
Underneath the pride and surprise
Rage gave love a little fire
Empowered now and nothing was the same
Love gave rage some direction
Rage had purpose
No longer being reckless from all of the pain
And the thing was the balance in their affections
They protected each other from the world's deception
As they grew together so did mutual trust
They exchanged vows and told each other, "The future is us."
Rage began to understand itself differently
A protector from the vestiges of history
Love saw itself changing too
It saw itself as root more abstruse than a musical Rubik's Cube
The two done fooled around and started revolutions
So powerful a pair also a heavy nuisance
To the ones who wanted Rage to kill itself off
And to the ones who wanted Love to wander in the dark
Love had to have Rage if their eyes were open
And Rage had to have Love to keep from dying early
This the same relationship that caused a savior to flip tables
Or a slave to take a saber to the maker of his labor
Or a mother to keep her baby from seeing this earth
Infanticidal the fight is deeper than flesh and nerve
Rage and Love taught their children to do crazy things
But that's based all on perspective, could be braver things
Always deeper than the physical so we pray for things
Dragons try to tear us apart, but we slay them things

What happens when your blood is embedded
With shredded papers
And your DNA has genes that tell you not to trust your neighbors
But your favorite waiter
Brought you over chocolate party favors
And that tingle by your navel
You can't make it go away
You keep on living and you keep on loving
That's what our parents taught us
In them late night discussions
When they told us about their love story
And unexpected partnership had people worried
When they used to hold hands and slow dance
And romance in the summer time
There was never only one design
Heart too big to be defeated by a foe
Now you know
