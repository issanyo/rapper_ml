I Do

R.I.P J Dilla

Fell asleep with the headphones on
I'm lost in the zone
I can hear the beat in my sleep
Been working on this beat for weeks
It starts to fade as I go to sleep
Counting snares fuck counting sheep
When shit get weird I'm aware that I'm sleep
The sun gets colder ,the ground feel softer
Then the dream is over
Then my brother tap me on shoulder
I can see her beautiful smile
She look down & made a frown
But it shouldn't matter
What sneaks is on my feet
For you to speak
My convo isn't weak
I can walk you up the street
I write & make beats rap & poetry
For Ms.stress , like Floetry
I began punishment
For her perfection
All this walking & talking found my direction
To your heart , tell me where we should start
Cause our love never end
I never pretend
My heart is on my sleeve
And watch that fashion trend
It cost nothing to bring you happiness
Let me begin & watch what happens miss

Bring you love
With the things we do

Stay in love
Cause its beautiful
