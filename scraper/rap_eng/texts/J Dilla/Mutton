Yeah, the way I assemble a simile
Is similarly a symbol of peace in the assembly
We end the beef, you see the two parties assembling
Cuz, the gift without love be like the clang of the cymbal be
To say it simply I marry words to bury beats
Life and death in the tip of the tongue and it's very sweet
Like raspberry lemonade get a taste of that Simply
From the rays of the Son the best things in life are the simple things
I'm a simple man all I need is a simple beat
Give it soul and a hint of heat, beat it up when I hit the sheets
With the ink, I don't be making music I'm making love
And Jay wasn't making beats he was making drugs
Watch him chop it up give you samples that got you hooked
Look outs sayin' "one time" drop and book, we not the crooks
Watch the jux, ministries making money that's off the books
Guard your wallets and pocketbooks wolves in the flock have got you shook
Big and bad, Bishop Pastor what big teeth you have
That's for eating lamb, though the meats tender from beating sheep with staff
Season that, before the feast you know we gone fleece them fast
See the custom wool designer suit I like to keep my fashion
Up to date, while i subjugate I'll take another plate
Of mutton plus my cup is low fill her up with the blood of saints
I'm drunk in love, money cometh from above
Make 'em clap they make it rain, a ton of bucks
Church is nothing but the club
Stripper name is buttercup, tippers aim to butter up
Tell my haters pucker up kiss the ring, sucker what
You gonna do? I'm untouchable
The Lord's Anointed no weapon formed could be used for thrusting through
The heart of such a Scrooge
Bust a move, I'll kick up my shoes and just get comfortable
You can tell em it's just a ruse, trust me I'm not the one to lose
My tongue is the gun I use, when it bucks all these bloody fools
Will be done with their stunts to prove that I lust for the money you's
A waste of time, and your hate's a crime in my Maker's eye's
Self-made so you can blame my pride 'cause my maker's I
Claim the prize, ain't gone wait for mine, taking this crazy ride
I'm staying high, ain't afraid to die, that's the greatest lie
So long as I stay alive I'll be taking tithes
Living my greatest life till in the flames of the grave I abide
Time to say goodbye
...say goodbye
...bye
