Black man on this beat. Seeing the moon Ordinary not with the defeat. I have the highest street that loops in the Cul-de-sac
While drug dealers on Newark providence deal that crack
I'm bout to make the flare to make a sign Imma ah attack and get back
I'm back on a wild anthem with the Lord how me other people adore idols
I'm great I'm not American Idol cause over popular can make a suicidal
In the industry has you geek with every dangerous feat trying to penetrate
Well, Terrell  you really wanna penetrate with words because a person can concentrate on your words until they victimize
Victimize to hypnotize to at the end of their gravestone their completely mentally pulverized Aww! Why did i do that? Did I do that? Meant to say How can help ya? Stand for ya! i want to do that cause sins we do is not hard to lack and one sin can kill ya so better no God's words can make a counterattack
