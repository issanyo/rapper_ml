(Verse 1: Emɐnuǝl X)

View the world through
My black glasses/

Cruising slow like molasses
Over some mountain passes/

Life is a jungle
Crabs, rats, and jackasses/

With snakes too, make sure
You know how high ya grass is/

Chill nigga, I fade
From the phony/

But haters think they
And I destined for matrimony/

Catch a Tony, for acting
Like you know me/

Ride solo dickeater, but that
Don't mean that I'm lonely/

My squad, GOD, and niggas
All down to ride/

By my side, sit back
Let my ambition drive/

Gazing at constellations hard
Work got me having patience (patients)/

Like the people who ask
Doctors for they daily vaccinations/

Hahh..

Dipping off
In the cut/

Tryna give this bitch
Named life my best nut/

Live on the run, live
Life to the fullest/

Life's a gun, if you
Pull it/

Be prepared to
Bite the bullet/


[Hook]

Sitting in the
Silent twilight/

The purple highlight
Of the twilight/

Wrap the night
Around me/

Blanket of black
On my back/

I feel safe
From the darkness/


[Verse 2: Emɐnuǝl X]

The game twisted
Niggas all commercial/

Stay true 'till I'm in
My Walker, like I'm Herschel/

The issues universal and
Extremely controversial/

Niggas acting nowadays
And life's one big rehearsal/

Transitioning, nigga
Fuck fitting in/

Swimming in Lake Michigan
Getting my Christening/

Cause I'm born again
Being an original/

Revolutionizing myself
Into an individual/

So a rumor won't
Phase me, from fugazy/

Niggas hating my
Rhymes almost daily/

When it comes to drama niggas
More hype than Osama/

Hating Obama, niggas bitch
Like baby momma's in your casa/

Uh-uh

And the blind
Lead the blind/

If that's the case open my
Blind's for sunshine/

Great men say great
Things come in time/

If that's true my
Shine deserves overtime/

Make melodies with
Ease like wind chimes/

Cause what seperates good
And great is a thin line/

Make sick lines, still
Ain't hit my prime/

Top spot gonna be mine but
What's worth it is the climb/


[Hook]
