[Verse 1: Young RJ]
You better take time, make up your mind
Do that now and don't waste your time
You don't ball you don't cross my mind
Everything over here green baby
Don't ever try to come cross that line
You can't hang 'cause you don't ever go ape
Four door Porsche, Cartier frames with the Bape
Been in the mud, but I 'ain't neva gon' stank
When I was down, I said I'm never gon' stay
When you dealin' with time, nigga you never can wait
Dealin' with niggas ya know they gon' be late
No motion
Got you at the bus stop
Long sleeves in the fleet driveway lookin' like a fuckin' truck stop
Y'all niggas don't know about motion

[Hook: Joyner Lucas]
Motion
Motion
A whole lotta money and a little less emotion
Motion
Motion
Slow motion better than no motion

[Bridge: Young RJ & Joyner Lucas]
Movin' slow motion through the shit
Prayers up swear a nigga blessed
Gettin' to the money nothin' less
Slow motion better than no motion
All my life I had to fight
Out the dark nigga I see the light

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
I'm sorry Ms. Jack-Jackson
This is from your half-black son
I used to have mad, mad girls
Now I only have-have one
Your daughter is a bad bad one
And all we did was have mad fun
I did some ain't shit-nigga shit
Now we have bad, bad blood
Hope that you can maybe understand
I done made mistakes as a man
And probably do it again
And it's funny how money change situations
Yeah, that lead to complications
Now you frontin' with your imitations
And you preachin' to the church and the congregation
All you niggas do is talk but you talk the great one
Before I was that nigga I collected pay stubs
And my baby mama trippin' back when she was 8 months
Said I'd be a bad influence to my son
She was goin' through the motions

[Hook: Joyner Lucas]
Motion
Motion
A whole lotta money and a little less emotion
Motion
Motion
Slow motion better than no motion

[Bridge: Young RJ & Joyner Lucas]
Movin' slow motion through the shit
Prayers up swear a nigga blessed
Gettin' to the money nothin' less
Slow motion better than no motion
All my life I had to fight
Out the dark nigga I see the light
Yeah that's how I'm livin' life

[Verse 3: Young RJ]
Thought you was my nigga then you dipped: that's the motion
Couldn't see the bigger picture wasn't focused
Now you blamin' me for the distance?
My whole plan was to get rich
Not to be waitin'
I'm not a doctor, I don't need patience
Sold out shows 'round the world
Crazy to think it all started in the basement
Now we on top of the basement
Had to give Hip-Hop resuscitation
Day dates big faces
Couldn't leave a trace so I cleaned up
I 'ain't got time to catch a case or make a motion
Niggas 'ain't get the notion
Do the work stop hopin'
Top spot I'm scopin'
Focused
These niggas 'ain't got a clue 'bout where they goin'
They 'ain't really 'bout the motion
