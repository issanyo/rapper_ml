[Hook]
On the count of 3 say Fuck The Police
1, 2, 3!
(Fuck The Police)

[Verse 1]
Yea, fuck em!
Applaud any nigga (scratch)
We can lose a few of em, we got enough of em
My niggas on the corner, they be dodgin and duckin em
Bitches gettin' pulled over end up fuckin em
For Real!!!
And see we got these fake cops
They thought he had a gun
Made a mistake cops, I hate cops
Turn on the TV whats this?
Another cop busted for illegal business
They outta control they outta their mind
They pullin you over, they hoppin inside
Just...they know you got drugs they know you got guns
And they know they be mad when they can't find none
Stupid!!!!
Dont they know they invented the stash box?
The heat be in it, you need a key to get in it
Any offended people suck my balls
All yall off the wall
Get stupid dawg
Don't hold back, Don't let go
Don't say Damn
Just say..Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[Brigde]
Get it up, Mo dough

On the count of 3 say Fuck the Police

(Fuck the Police)

[Verse 2]
Yea, don't they know its dangerous in these streets?
Dont you know its gangs of us that roll deep?
Nigga!
We O'G's fill up the whole jeep, nigga
Ill wit the flows,and deal with the beats
Ill in the Rover, its over homes we hold deez
The reason we hold beans its no peace in the streets
With the police in the streets, Yo
It's cops that owe niggas
Dough for O's and ki's
It's more than a beef with five-oh
In the streets with the five-oh its a game of survival, duke
Now tell me who protects me from you?
I got people that buy tek's and weed from you
And all ah nigga see in the news
Is cop corruption niggas gettin popped for nothing
And niggas get stopped for nothing
And cops pull out the Glock and bust em
Yall need to get shot for nothing!
Cause we don't hold back
We just let go
We don't say damn...
We just say..whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Mo' dough baby...
Fill it up!
