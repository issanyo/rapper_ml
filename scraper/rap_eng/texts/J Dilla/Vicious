[Intro]
Your... Smile
Yo, to all yall that uh
All yall that uh, Didn't think I could spit you know
(Heh)
Well here we go(x3)
I told yall, understand me
My plan is to win your hearts before im winning a grammy uh

[Verse]
I couldn't even figure where to start
Your figure is like a trigger that's goin' off of the art
Like Kodak on a masterpiece, feastin' from a new release
You just leased your freedom, the planet has got you on a leash
But you an your dogs too spaced out to notice
The beauty of it all is the flower flow of a lotus
Lets get back on the track
These posers trainin' on rap
I'm doin' the same thing
But homophonin' it back
They ready to interact so they showing off
I'ma send you raiders to your tomb like you Lara Croft
I protect my craft wit a pen an I slash your sword
That's a blade wit 3 felons an i'm the ward
But wait uh-huh
Let the rape continue on with the lyrical
Im just tryna' generate memories off a miracle
So you reading my memoir
Recognize like a centaur, mythical
Let a brother forget what isn't forgivable
Told my bros to let me flow now they wanting a mentar (mentor)
Who is potent as ocean an flow as wet as a sea star
Look at my team we got the heart of a villain
Vigilante commitin' these massacres that you feelin'
I'm tired of bein' tired
Offer off of the words
That's really painting a picture that's absolutely absurd
But taken like it was nathan (nothin)
Raps sick wit' the wordplay
All these rappers i'm bakin is adding soft to my souffl√©
Camera shots wit precision is only blurrin' they vision
Continue fallin' victim im risin off the derision
Money not on my mind an they tellin' me pay attention
Tell me that when I go off that i'm not building the tension
The hypnotism in silence
Only Muting They Violence
Killing all of these dreams like religion clashing with science
Tell em what's my compliance
No one will take apart
I wrote a rap with my best friend that's what started the spark Uh
I never thought that I could get this malicious
The rhythm is ludicrous when spittin' lyrical vicious
You know
Lyrical Vicious, you know
Lyrical Vicious uh

Part 2 - (Outro/Hidden Track)

[Intro]
Uh
Yea, Uh
Yea
Okay(2x)

[Verse]
Late night write visuals on the page
Wondering if you died how my whole life would change
Or if you never existed i'd probably do the same
In 7th grade when I can only view my life in shame
I re frame the imagery of the first time I heard your voice
Without you I had reversed rejoice
The choice I chose to show you you were my passion see
I spit fire but all you do is extinguish me
Vivid as blinds who can see the darkness in your heart
Plan it all no wonder your love for me's spaced apart
The ears inhale the scent
Of the sound
An without you, i probably would just be
Underground
The love for you never fades you sooth me down from my hate
I try to aid you more that H.I.V in M.J
Your the light within the life
The pacifist with a knife
The double entendre making me think more than twice

[Hook]
And I don't know what am I supposed to do
When I just can't get over you
It's hard to know what i'm going through
When all the writers have blocked my view
Now all I need's just you to soothe the pain
I need you just to ease the stress
I don't know what I have left too confess
When all I try to achieve is gain
Okay... Yea
