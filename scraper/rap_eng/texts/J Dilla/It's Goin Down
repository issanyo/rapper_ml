(chorus)
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down

I be that nigga bringing fat funk freestyle perspectives
Rappers couldn't see me, they hired fucking detectives
Check this when I flex this, put it on point
That nigga Skillz droping foucers in your local juke joint
I'm still paying dues and slaying crews
Still getting up at niggas asses
Like that little brothers Underoo's
Shoes haotatin' in ya air, it ain't news I stay on bitches
Like Dano Kariges
At partys I retaits and make niggas wanna fight
So when they play some reggae keep happerseein' to the right
Right outta my life you and ya hoddie bitch
Seein' thous of body, whitin no infron of me
V.A running shit, you best be believe it
If Im up and commin, all ya niggas is down and leavin'
Hit me with a pound when I come to ya town
When you see my face, you know it's about to go down

(chorus)
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down

Now if I told one time. I told you before child
You can't touch one kid, who got two billions styles
Mean while, when it comes to mics I be cheeting
Im destend to find new ways so ill MC's
And Im real with this, I come off like a scab
It's the dread heads checking for repesenting north av
Kids pack tecs, I pack technics
Lyrical contact, now Im strapped on the streetz
Freezby aient, niggas be trying
But standing next to me can result in lyrically dying
I wrote the rhyme n' broke the next rappers back
So before you run up in my face, fool, remember that
Advanced in the art of maintaining
Rappers be getting folding like lawn chairs when it's raining
Natural born MC, don't attempt to F around
Went off like four pounds
Now bust how they go down

(chourus)
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down

Yo, my section be mic checking and MC decking
You can bump me I ain't country
I never said I wreck it (true)
So wack MC's chill with persistence
Cause the minist that I freestyle
Can probably shoop n' your existence
I make beats to stort
Rappers be getting court
I swear all MC's be sampling my fucking thoughts
It's on when I hit the metronome, beat acsin' at your show
Na, nigga I booby trapped your microphone
Droping rappers and black hole, hell or heaven
Pull n' girls of smore
Like Pam Grier, in seveny seven
You can't work a verse, pass it
When I come in niggas start breaking wind like big jackets
Getting their ass kicked, lyrically breaking backs
My shit is hot, my record company shouldn't be fucking pressing wax
(You gon' represent nigga?)
Nigga hide that sound
Check your battle stats, cause it's about to go down

(chorus)
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby
It's goin down
