Honestly, I wish you were my girl
I wish I had the opportunity to give you my world
I wish that I can go back and time and fix a mistake
But it's too late, I've already accepted the fate
You absolutely drive me crazy, my own mind
I mean, you've been on this planet, this whole time?
While I've been beating up myself, saying, "She's hard to find"
Yet, you pop up randomly, blows my mind
Love's priceless, I tap dance for half of a quarter
I guess you read me like a book, cause the chapter is over
I try to tell myself I'm cool, at least I'm pretending to
I dunno what God was thinking when he invented you
I can go on and on about how your beauty affected me
How you seduced me, not with the lust, but love
But I'm stuck with this bruised heart you left me with
I pretend I don't give a fuck when you text me shit, yo

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Ah, yo, I wanna get to the point

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Heh, yo, I wanna get to the point

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Hah, yo, I wanna get to the point

Ah, yo, I wanna get to the point
Yo, uh

The screwed up thing is, ain't nothin' even your fault
I never managed to give you a text or even a call
I believe that I was stalled by your seemingly conscience
You were easier to look at, and you seemed flawless
Fuck the anxiety and the bi-polar
I was finding you beautiful, hopin' you'd be by my shoulder
I'd lie if I told ya that I moved on from the conversations
Even the sensation of talkin' to ya was mad amazing
Lookin' up to the skies everytime of the day
I pray that everything goes right for finding your way
But I shake my head, enough with the foolishness and the dreams
Enough with the fantasy, I step into reality and think
On how I could've had ya, and I ain't tryna be romantic
I'm just being real, that's all I can be
Fuck eye candy, give a nigga the diabetes
Find my mind retreating when I think of you like every minute

And I ain't even tryna sing a hook
Ah, yo, I wanna get to the point, uh

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Ah, yo, I wanna get to the point, yo

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Ah, yo, I wanna get to the point, uh

Yo, I wanna get to the point
Hah, ayo, I wanna get to the point, yo

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Hah, yo, I wanna get to the point, hah

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Hah, yo I wanna get to the point

And I don't even wanna sing a hook
Ah, I wanna get to the point, hah

Yo, I wanna get to the point
Hah, yo, I wanna get to the point

Get to the point, get to the point, get to the point...
