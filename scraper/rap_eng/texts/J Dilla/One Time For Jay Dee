They hear me on a beat they say "Damn, who's that?"
It's the Same old me, not a brand new swag
This is for the ones who said I can't do rap
I remember all the niggas saying "Man, you trash"
Now you wanna ride the wave, get a damn doo rag
I'm bout to son y'all, got a brand new bag
If I was a sun, I'd be the brand new Nash
But I shine too bright, y'all would tan too fast
And sagging makes you look like damn douchebag
But I'm not a menace even if my pants do sag
Niggas wanna step to the champ too bad
We done went five rounds, they ain't land two jabs
Get ya weight up, I'm in Shamu's class
I can only come first, man I can't do last
My singing's off key and my dance moves trash
But when I drop the mic they say "DAMN YOU SPAZZED"
