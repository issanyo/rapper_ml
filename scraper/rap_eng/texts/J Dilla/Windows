[Verse 1: T3]
It ain’t sweet automatic lemon squeeze
Kamikaze trying to kill everybody’s speech
Yeah we hunger but our minds bout to feast
Read the signs of the times they’re the signs of the streets
You’re defined where there’s peace
Can you tell a merchant selling wool to a sheep
Yes, I am an amiss
Coming from the deep abyss What is this the venomous rapper soul eclipse I abyss
Overcome or did you just submit
In a pinch I was sprint
Hazardous situation
They triggered my Spidey sense
So intense put on our hoodies for remembrance
Now we need forgiving and
My n*gga’s strong sentiments
So I used my performance to see if y’all are healing yet
They put thorns in your side and say you ain't feeling it Twist a blade in your heart as they cut it up to a million
Watch as we assemble them through
Turn into a billion

[Chorus:]
Through the, through the windows in my mind
I see the world go round (we see it we see it we see it)
Hustlers getting kicked when the sun goes down (we live it we live it we live it)
Cops on the prowl and your mans on trial (we feel it we feel it we feel it)
This is how it is in the world right now

[Verse 2: Baatin]
You better understand in the stainless
My wise decisions are polished like it’s wood grain and painless
Entertain the solace sent
Locomotive on the track
The starship come back
Conversations in the crowd which what does it all mean
Not a word not a word but one minute on the screen
Get the team I’m gonna tell them
Stacking the laser beams
My pursuit was to kick it with you it came true
Too many burdens for one come on
Pull the curtains on this
Living the trife life
Affecting in the bliss
It’s still a all time high
Look out the window there’s a guy
Keeping his swagger sling on the dough for the fam
Felonies got a charge like damn but he still got his head
He looking like he dodging a scheme
Now get the cream dollar bill
Get the money dollar bill, money
Get the cream dollar bill money!
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young RJ]
Trials and tribulations of this life
Stress starts to feel like an ordinary night
Get it now never do we think about it twice
Just the way my crew cut
Afternoon chillin with homies who throw a deuce up
Take pot to turn stone to Medusa
Till they’re stoned in the gutter
I atone for my future
Cops rush every other night
But we just keep our sights up
Gotta keep our lights on somehow

[Outro: J Ivy]
Who’s that peeking through my window
Pow! nobody now
Somebody vowed to keep their boot on my neck
Keep their boot on my wreck
We gasp fighting for every breath
We take a few steps but there’s a billion steps left
When new slaves playing a game with no refs
Just cops whose grandfathers wore white sheets
With their cross in their right hand
Black balls in their left
Damn why you go there
Cuz war has been declared
It ain’t a war on drugs it’s a war on us
They use our labor to fund their trusts
Trusts that go throw that brick at your glass house
We ain’t outside marching as soon as we walking with our ass out
No credit so we’re trying to cash out
No doubt we let the demons in and fix them a plate
In the end we fixated with hate
Trying to be great but we don’t know what great is
Yeah we know the latest trends with a quickness
Can’t cure the common cold without a bunch of sickness
Judge was weighing heavy we trying to lighten the scale
Shit being shipped in all the way from China
I’m eating more kale and well it’s how we rebel
Cameras on the block stocking up on intel
Smartphones hanging out every window
And Instagram in this hell
