[Verse 1]
Who copped the rum?
Vodka bubblegum
Stocked shots of double-yum
N' Ciroc a saucerful of Ummagumm--
A dumb emcee who spits fables
Get Gone with the Wind
Off some Clark Gable
Cat cradle, Chapin lips with no labels
But stay stable
Like legs on a candlelit dinner table
Wrote this off a handle of Captain
In fact...
Could use a line of some scandalous Co- I mean Clapton
"What's happenin'?
I keep my dreadlocks in a napkin ring"
Laughing to myself over the sink
ANOTHER DRINK!

[Verse 2]
Anyway
Stay thirsty like it's Thursday
Bird?
Yeah, his tolerance stays otherworldly
Dominant like Moe to Larry and early Curly
Lyrics is burly, rest assuredly
Blurred Birdy's words'll stay with you like curry
But sheesh, what's the hurry?
It ain't hard to keep up
So here, catch the ketchup, Ash Ketchum
Ya food's up
Beef
How you talk about Cudi?
You're a has been blip, runny-nosed fuddy duddy
Debby Downer over here
She think she got a career
Don't quit your day job, bitch
You crack a mirror
In fact, here, the only shit I wanna hear
Is when your sextape leak, time to disappear!
