[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

Narcoleptic tendencies render thee from the ill
So I conjured all these remedies endlessly with my skills
I'm in another world and honestly they fear that ill appear
Cause if I do I'm causing utter disbelief to every ear
While they acting my thumb is playing Galactus
Just writing up something mean while the other four are fantastic
It'll knock you right off your feet like I whooped you in Mortal Kombat
I set myself up to win if they ballin all of em Bobcats
Drop back if you feeling like you can't catch up
It's not my fault that I'm young and my brain is fully developed
That's something they'll never fathom even if they tried to tether
Ororoe knows when I brainstorm that's something she can't weather
When I record its no relation to the Guinness
People tried to shit on me like a wire full of Pigeons
They yelling out stop the racket I told em that this ain't tennis
I abuse every beat that I spit on leave it like Emmitt

[Hook: My people told me make em go and bounce to this, make em bounce to this, this for the people who carrying doubts and shit, doubts and shit (2x)]

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]

Watch out let me flip the script
I swear they not stopping me I'm on infinite
My penmanship is sicker than syphillis
Foreseen the green my pockets on Grinch and shit
But, I'm still new to this
Got the juice like Q and Bish
Showed my ass before rap I've never been a nudist
Thriving harder than the mutants
In the sewer, they like koopa
I'm TMNT they never touched the goo
And, I'm in tackling range of chasing this dream
Gotta hold on real tight cause it might slip through the seams
I'm addicted to the life and I might possibly be
The next to step up and shine like lightning
I put in hard work while they paying for pipe dreams
I'm fighting for what is right if you robbing I'm Nightwing
I might swing when it hit you feel like Jiu Jitsu
I never needed a tommy, a dill maybe no pickles
That's sinful the way I make the track bleed perceive it as menstraul
They told me take my time but i'd rather rush like limbaugh

[Hook: My people told me make em go and bounce to this, make em bounce to this, this for the people who carrying doubts and shit, doubts and shit (2x)]

[Verse 3: Alex Ruffin]

They told me aim to become one of the goats
As a kid the story said I'm gonna meet a hungry troll
That randomly reappear when I'm thinking life is a stroll
A troll equal a hater a hater equal a troll
They no longer saying me rappin a funny sight
Now these cats all up on my balls like Money Mike
They don't get the picture invalid on Instagram
They living ridiculous my head spinning like ceiling fans
To these beats I'm Leatherface, They feather weights
A starving artist ill eat your food I don't sever plates
Then ill say mmmm food just like I was Metal Face
I go back to my rhyme scheme
Connected to my music like I was born a Siamese
Conceived a seed now I stand tall like Pine Trees

(Yeah)
