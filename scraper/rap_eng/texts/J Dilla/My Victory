[Verse 1: MK Asante]
Woke this morning, claimed victory
Velcro that good energy so it stick to me
Sun shining so that shade don’t get to me
It’s a new day, I’m seeing things differently
Like, maybe some things wasn’t meant for me
Or maybe they just wasn’t meant to be
Always rep, bench-mark consistency
Consistently, Fed-Ex with the delivery
Open doors for Hip-Hop – that’s chivalry
Flow take you another place – that’s Tennesse
That triumphant thump that you can run wit
They say it can’t be done but we dun done it
My life's a memoir, Buck, kept it a hunnit

[Hook]
My victory

[Verse 2: MK Asante]
Feel the shift, pinky to keyboard
Devils shook cuz I don’t spit for lil' rewards
I spit for lil' cuz booked across 3 wards
Dreams of seashores but sure never see shores
Navigate like Miss Jakes through life’s detours
Bang a right at the light and round the applause
Thank you, thank you, far too kind
Man, they can’t see us winning, far too blind
Beams of light still peaking thru faulty blinds
My Philly boys really sharper than porcupines
So what’s up? We tryna find a cookout
Look-out young bucks, get took-out on the crook-route
Got Bad jawns pulling my good book out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Maya Angelou]
Young women, young men of color
We add our voices to the voices of your ancestors
Who speak to you over ancient seas
And across impossible mountain tops

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Maya Angelou]
Come up from the gloom of national neglect
You have already been paid for
Come out of the shadow of irrational prejudices
You owe no racial debt to history
The blood of our bodies and the prayers of our soul
Have bought for you a future without shame
Bright beyond the telling of it

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Maya Angelou]
You are the best we have
You are all we have
You are what we have become
My name is Maya Angelou
