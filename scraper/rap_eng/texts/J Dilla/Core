War torn, still shackled by the remnants
Of the negative events I trialed while living in my head
Yeah my victory's' defense against oppressive syndicates
Who's sole intents to get me drenched in doubtfulness and my regrets
Tense am I with my eyes open
Chopin as my theme music
As I fuck, form, fight, believe to and dream to it
I loosen my means to which esteem was rooted
Because illusive feats treat my like I'm seated though I'm moving
As soon as I beat a few up I'm aware where I will have to be
I focus my distress then administer badass-ery
Ask me if the fields which I had fought in have collapsed from
The amount of the cadavers that were challenging my mastery
No question have I been around the block a lot
From that I learned to hop and scotch and all about Vipassana
Had to stop to watch my opposites go botch their shot
Yeah, you're rocking with anonymous
Whose got the hots for soccer moms
Writing has been onerous but trudging right through it
Who would guess that this stunod deals with his raps like hes Anubis
True as opposite of false. Balls gripped when emceeing
Seeing how I'm diffident mixed with beats and meanings
It leaves me overlooked by folk who don't read into things
That's been presented
If it ends then so be it
