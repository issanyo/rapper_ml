[Verse 1 - Noveliss]
I'm in the zone again, about to rearrange Stonehenge
With these flows I pen, I see an opening
Cuz' you don't protect your neck and a vest won't
Stop the assassin that slash, with a notepad I got the Death Note
Everything that gliders ain't Sharingan my Padawans
Master Qui-Gon with his eyes gone in search of Byakugan
That visual prowess align with that, knowledge of the force
My mind got mileage of course
Emcees change course at the, sight of how the blade has been forged
Pray to the most high when Battosai be swinging his sword
Slice you all out of sorts, my notebook over runneth with lines that fill up the morgue
Keep it cordial in the, presence of immortals
Came a long way from eating Top Ramen
And Top Rhyming to climb from the bottom to get stuck in this box that I'm in
Because life is 4 corners no matter how you design it
But I been around the world I'm a write a book to describe it...

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Noveliss]
The doctor, if you lost your faith in Rap I would prescribe this, imposters
Noveliss vs every Novice I'm dropping them out of helicopters flying through Gotham
Precipitation indeed, it's raining bullshit rappers cosigned by a magazine, enter the brain
Are you not entertained by the slain, the name Maximus
Gladiator tactics to smash an antagonist
The flowtagonist, flow tagging anyone
Liquid swords forged out of lithium, smash the periodic table after I finish them
To test them slice the planet in half at the prime meridian
Tilt-a-whirl back breaker snapping a rappers ilium
Turn a Colosseum to a mausoleum, a tomb
Walk through a museum in a necklace made from the skulls of every rapper I defeated before I gained my freedom
Listening to DOOM...
