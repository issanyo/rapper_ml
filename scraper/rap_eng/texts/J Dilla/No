[Intro]
It's 2014, I'm tired of this shit
I've been hanging out with shadows long enough
"Jonwayne, that fucking neck-beard rapper, I can't stand looking at his fucking face"
"How do you expect me to listen to his music, if I can’t jack off to him?
You know what I’m saying?"

[Verse]
I'm ready to hang it up
I mean this platinum record ain't gotta check
See, I'm not stressing
And I think that the fact that I'm an underdog is a blessing
By the time you see the white of my eyes, I’m calling shots
Getting closer to the plaque with every "knock knock"
Got your girl wet with every heart throb
So feel threatened, I'm about to take every odd job
I'm the illest on this side of the solar system
You've been pissing in the wind by pissing me off
Didn't think the king was so white he'd be sleeping with sunblock
But my real kryptonite is when they don't recognize that they're in the presence of a legend, alright stop
Fronting, start backing me, I keep it real gutter for me and my family
Can't do it any other way, you may lie to yourself
But unlike you I can't put my dick on the shelf
I got a gut, that's where I'm hiding my spells
But when I'm on the mic I'm just a picture of hell
So player keep it to yourself, or give me a reason to start feenin
And leave all the people that you know grieving
Peace to my demons that keep me on my feet breathing deep sea scheming
In the Yellow Submarine, beaming
While all you rappers, chugging and chiefing trying to get a skeezer to please so you can beat em' on the weekend
Much love
Make sure you wear a glove
The whole community wants to keep me in the mud
But you can't put a silencer upon this .38 Snub
I'm loud and I'm proud, there's the rub, there's the rub
Yeah, you know I got more funk in my prose
And all the fucking farts that you ever smelt through your nose
So who gives a shit if I'm rocking sandals at shows
I'm fucking in them too, now you know

[Outro]
"Stop rapping"
"Go back to making beats you piece of shit"
I keep this neck beard on watch because it's got your Mama's juices
She pretty loose
So I fold her like origami, it's pretty cool
I spit rhymes
Still not very good at free styling, but, that's life
