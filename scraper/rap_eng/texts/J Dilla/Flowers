[Hook]
I got a flawless flow and some flowers just for ya'll

[Verse 1]
Negrizzy is back with two u's
I used to live as a kid that isn't rare that's often
But at my 18th birthday my only gift was a coffin
I know society the undertaker, bitch I saw him
Look, at my real born day jah gave me a gift
To spit like god himself so I take another rip
While i write a summer hit
In the middle of the winter 'cause I'm still a rebel
Eventhough this ain't the reason why I'm a sinner
Even Jesus was a rebel, that's why I travel
I have to reach the next level before he say's here is the end though
Honestly I ain't finding shit but i'll never stop searching
I'm a negro, latino, white men, homie I'm just tolerance in person
You gotta open up your mind as long your thoughts are worth it
The same question about how living on this earth is
I'm gonna take this shit over without dunks man I'm gonna dirk it
Another young nigga trying to make waves in the states like my lower sax nigga schroeder
And sometimes I'll commit a crime but the case is never murder
So you better turn up like tina turner
Yo what's the word huh?

[Hook]
I got a flawless flow and some flowers just for ya'll

[Verse 2]
Ya'll know this World so sour
That's why I need to fight but I still fight with a flower
Just to let ya'll niggas know that all we need is Love
I swear nobody can get enough
'cause this world so tough
That's my i gotta play my rough
You sword will beat my flower? man I doubt it like chuck
'cause love is greater and stronger then hate
Why you serving it up on a plate?
I hope you recognize it before it's too late
This nigga paid, atention, to the real things
So I can let my mind fly without real wings
So I get connected without a string
And I don't mean a god damn iPhone that rings
Nigga that shit stings
'cause all the bullshit on the media is telling you how to live
That's a fact
I got some seeds that i would to seed with ya
So let's escape out of this trap with the reefer
I'm spittin holy words like a preacher
I would love to talk about this when I meet ya
But ya'll to busy popping molly, on partys
I'm sorry shortys

[Hook]
I got a flawless flow and some flowers just for ya'll

[Verse 3]
Let me repeat, ya'll to busy poppin molly on partys
All these dumb conversation about celebrities
Man this shit so strange no searching for the truth
Just for a men who can explain and I'm like damn
That's why ya'll niggas need the remedy that's my shit and me
But i won't fall in love with the hype 'cause I don't wanna end up like Linsanity
So it's all about love, for my niggas, my killas, my bros and shit
Like i'm that nigga fresh outta Tennesee
This shit so heavenly like you sitting on the clouds
Everybody need to hear this make sure you play it loud
Is what you have to do when you jammin to a beat by J dilla
I'm smoking J after J I'm a motherfucking J Killa
Call me Jack The Ripper 'cause this shit right here will kill your hoeass nigga and all your records
I don't give a fuck how much you sell
My shit is so fire make you living in hell
I'm just making sure that you'll fail

[Outro]
So check this then you'll know you have to tell
About my flawless flow and my flowers
