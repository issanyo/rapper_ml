And get drunk off my dick tonight
I want you to get plastered off of my meatsock tonight
Please blaze my dick like a blunt and
Make me want your cunt

It's all I want, that's all I ever want in my life...

You said you lookin for them niggas yeah we be them

Homeboy don't ever step to S.V. again
Shoutout to 5 Ela, ain't no beef with them
Gotta say what's up to HouseShoes and Beej n Dem

Peace, let's get into flow again
We be them, niggas yeah we be them

Y'all motherfuckers say the 3 don't be freestylin

You want it boy and you know who - got it
You claim original and sound like somebody
