Hook:
I smile and I be laughing when my company come
There is power in my people 'cause we've come from the lumps
We know the hills and the valleys
The seas and the streams
When the season is mean
We still believe in our dreams
Green guava

Verse 1:
We don't fear the dark 'cause we was born in it
Melanin smother the greens and make a song in it
The breath of the ruler is in me so I'm long winded
Steady knocking at the door, ding-dong get it
Growing through
What we going through
And never settle up
Black joy be rebellious
Us do cherish us
Black joy be in the belly of
Where there is heavy love
And it got to be that way
If no we
Who gon' be there for us?
We died for dice rolling in the stolen lands of time
Now we die for ice holding in a folding land of shine
In a foreign land I find us in the middle of a war
The battle lines are drawn and I would rather go on tour
But your score ain't ready for the healing power in my sword
We roll up to the vengeful with a posture wanting more
The fake love purports to be an obstacle for sure
But we know
We're likely eating all imposters with a fork
Green guava

(Hook)
Ay let that breathe
You got to let something like this breathe

Verse 2:
"Breathe baby breathe"
What the nurse told me
I almost didn't make it
That's my birth story
First cries more like worship
For the the first glory
And I'm a rock it like Taraji
'Til the hearse hold me
Hold that
But don't sacrifice the swing though
The groove is something that my hips do have a thing for
We can spit it like this or we can sing slow
Bring the snare, put it between right where the strings go
Seems as though
Nobody got no schemes to choke
The life out of my folk
Ain't nothing we ain't seen before
So bring your rope
Your policies that squeeze our throats
We got hope
It's too big for you to heave or throw
Even though
We're far away from even slopes
And degrees is cold
That don't stop our feet from leaping, nope
So this dance that we got, it ain't escaping nothing
It's a portal into something
Can't be captured in discussion
So we rushing with no masks on
Getting our pigskin player in the past on

(Hook)
Last time yall told me you wanted more bars on this Dilla beat
So here's more bars

Verse 3:
Don't it feel so good when we overcome it
We know the good 'cause we've had a lot of overcoming
Homies wondering when I'll make it to a jumbotron
Well I don't know, I'm just being led
So get your wonder on
What I know is I'm gonna speak Lie
'Cause I wasn't supposed to have it
What I know is if I get a chance
I'm a grab it
Ain't no number 45 on that
What I know is my shorty live in fact
What I know is we gotta show up better
Center black women and listen to elders
What I know is that we're still alive
What I know is that we got the light
What I know is I'ma let it shine
This little light of mine

(Hook)
