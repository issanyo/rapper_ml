[Intro: Unknown + Jay Dee]
You are now getting sleepy
Yeah
Hehehehehe
Whoop!
Ooh
Yeah
Turn it up, uh

[Hook]
Y'all want that hit
To the beat like, "Blocka, blocka"
That shotgun, shotgun
Shotgun, shotgun

[Verse: Jay Dee]
It's gangster, gangster-blingin'
Deal with the banger, danger
Head crack, head crack, what I do
When a valette do pull the thang up
Dudes better get their game up, way they chains hang
And I stay untanglin' 'em
And them boys is 'bout that
'Bout don't talk me to death, put money where ya mouth at
Book money, that's how ya get your house back
Bring wife to my show, I hit ya spouse
To live with it, get it, get it?
On that white-tee tip, with the fitted
Get ya paper, extra, extra
Pay J, ready, fuck is the check cut?
This is Detroit city, and these boys with me, ain't the game
Want that thang? Just hit me

[Hook]
Aye, G, they need that hit
It's Jay Dee, and bling that shhâ€”
Take this shotgun, shotgun
That shotgun, shotgun
Take this shotgun, shotgun
To the beat like, "Blocka, blocka"
That shotgun, shotgun
Shotgun, shotgun
