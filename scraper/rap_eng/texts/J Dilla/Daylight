[Verse]

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
D'shon is back up on the mic to get some more dough
Tell em that your favorite rapper worked at Micky D's
1 to 8 for that 7.25 pay
You not a real nigga if you ball and not eat
You not a real nigga if your kids don't see you
Rather front about hoes numbers in ya phone
When they stunt, you spending summer alone that's a bummer
Sun up to down is the grind
Night time is the time where them dreams shine
If you haven't figured out, I wanna be a star now
Ever since the ramen packs with the food stamp card
Now im old enough to smoke tar blacks
Always asking where the weed at
Can you believe that?
Every damn day its the same bullshit
Tell me nigga how the fuck am I supposed to live?
Apostrophe gonna put in work for the Grammy
To be better than any artist that you people stanning
Im hoping that you understand my stance as a writer
You'll see my destiny when you glance at my life
All I need is paid rent and food and im good
Fuck with my needs nigga, I wish you would
Im the meek one that shall inherit the planet
Always doing more than average man can manage


[Hook](Repeated)

Daylight

Get off
Have a drink, go to sleep, repeat till we die
