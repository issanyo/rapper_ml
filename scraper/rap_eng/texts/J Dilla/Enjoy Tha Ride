M.i - Enjoy Tha Ride
[J.Dilla Edition] #SundayNightSixteens
(Week 2-11/3/13)

Intro
You know what time it is
Or better yet… you know what day it is
I mean, its Sunday…
That means you get a new 16 right?
Yea… well, okay

Verse
Cause as long as I got this drum kit / can’t tell me nothing
A sucker for it, I’m stuck with it / love what it comes up with
I’m suffering from a sickness, a system unrealistic
Ideas in this vision / I’m thinkin idealistic
Take a ticket to this trip, but what’s it hittin’ fo?
To a utopian village, hoping this where all the women grow
Didn’t know I was slippin tho…
Lying to fix a note / sampling all these artist
I’m caught up tryin’ to get this vote
Vocals on pro / fa sho  I get focused to try to choke em’ with flows
Or maybe open this do’
Or maybe just open myself up to concept of gettin’ this doh
Been living solo for so long, I’m high / the ceiling would know
M.i is a mode / that I’m ridin’ wit
I’m Michael Rafael if you don’t…know
But if I gotta drop it / all good
I’m cool wit it / cause by the numbers, M.I in Nigeria’s a fool wit it
Who’s winning? Not me
Sht, its all good the top seems
More unattractive than ever
A lot of coke heads & critics
I’m better off without it
Off without em’

I’m finally where I need to be
I don’t need sht from y’all
I’m finally where I need

I don’t need sht from yall
I don’t need yalls approval
I’m finally where I need to…
