[Chorus]

Ride with a nigga
Rhyme with a nigga
Don't lie to a nigga
Dont die on a nigga
Don't cry for a nigga
When its time to ghost
Dont be sad when we go
In the wind which we blow

[Verse: 1]

Real men don't ride with pistols
They're in school writing with pencils
Raising their mental
Release topics over instrumentals
Stop it all
Stop the presses innocents getting pressed, steamed
Vegetative states, sedatives for pain in the face
Can't catch a break, you caught one that's fate
They glance through the peephole
Ding dong, you're in a ditch feet cold
Breed the soul, before you set it free
Born sinner is his pedigree
Mr.Red was happy, to welcome you in
So hospitable, and heart-warming
Is it hot in here? or is it just you?
Maybe it was a bad idea to wear a suit, (nauhh)
You perspired through attire
White smoke from the black sleeves
Why is Mr. red laughing?
Cause he thinks he burnt you out
But you really got him
His neighbor gave you what you need before you fought him
Tell god would you

[Chorus: 2]

Ride for ya nigga
Lie for ya nigga
Die for ya nigga
Cry for ya nigga
Say good bye to ya nigga, but you won't
Now that hes gone, you've got yet another one

[Verse: 2]

I'm not a good guy
I'm just an evildoer doing less damage to life
I'd be dammed if i let a vice ruin mine
I'm waiting for a higher purpose on standby
Its funny, I can't understand I
(nauhh) anywhere you want to go i'll take you there
Tell me miss or mister
Angel or demon
I play both teams, when i scheme
Peasantry to presidency, high dreams
By any means neccessary
I gotta have my slice,  salivate before i masticate
Pass the fate my negus
Please don't agitate my negus
My mind exacerbates living my negus
They want to weed us
Out of the planet
They try to cheat us
But here comes panic
They can't defeat us
Show me what you got motherfucker, let's see it
We ready

[Chorus: 3]

Don't ride on a nigga
Walk lines with a nigga
Shine with a nigga
Live life my nigga
Its time my nigga
Let's go





[Outro]

My excellance won't be murdered
Im galloping through these hurdles
Can't tell me nothing, no interrrupting me
Im moving foward more words to go toward
Legendary status on this apparatus of rapping
Now let me hear you clap and pat it


[Chorus: 1]
