(From Jay-Z Interview "Rap Is Poetry")
Rap is poetry and there is great writing in rap as well. You know you never hear rappers being compared for like the greatest writers of all time. I mean if you take those lyrics and you pull em away from the music and you put em up on a wall somewhere and someone had to look at em... They would say this is genius!

Jay-Z was like a God to me, back when I had dreams of making varsity
Now I only dream of the Carnegie
I'm haulin ass in the search of equality
Social media is not where you should follow me
I'm fathering a idea in the mind of the listeners, the crime is the subtle lack of quantity
Now adays it always seems like something bothers me
I'm overlooked, though all I give is artistry
Apart of me is in the past, the other part is in a wallaby residing in Australia where the water be
A metaphor for saying somewhere that I lost a piece
A treasure sure to be forgotten, when my body gets to rottin
Everybody say "I got you" till you call and see
Being real seems to be forgotten policy
They politicin, telling lies, live unlawfully
A wise man always says all the talk is cheap
Contradiction, I'm giving birth to what you call a dream
A contraceptive couldn't stop what I've been fathering
That we can all become the royalty, I'm harvesting
Without the Harvarding, marginally, We can all be Kings... Or Queens
