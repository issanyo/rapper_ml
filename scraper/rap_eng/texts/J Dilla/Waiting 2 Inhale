[Hook] {X4}
You smell that smell, we smoke out
Inhale, exhale that 'dro out

[Verse One]
I feel like Pat Sajak, cats askin' if they can buy an E
I give 'em 20% off if they get high as me
I give it to 'em for free if they can find my keys
My weed had a vasectomy
You'll never find a seed, indeed
It's the O dot squad fo' 'sho
So hot, clog your nose
So stop, drop and roll
Yo
Once the flow drops, watch your hoes
Clothes drop, lock the show
Robots jock the flow
Most sick flows
Wearin' Jordans so sick, so rare
Jordan stared and asked me, "Where the fuck you get those?"
Told him, "My bitch knows, talk to my boo
And you can meet defeat/the feet but you can never walk in my shoes."
I
Drive real good, drunk and high
It's easy as pumpkin pie
Believe me I'm drunk tonight
Bye
If you need me I'm slumped inside
Chief and I'm Funkdafied
Reefer, you want, you buy

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
And those who doubted me, I'm provin' you wrong
I put a little blue in the bong at 23 can do you a song
And if your girly's in the place to be
I never fuck her gently, I give her that Tenacious D
Cross between, Jack Black face and me
What? I'm not allowed to include me?
Fuck it than sue me
I'm up in the hooptie with the blunt of that ooh-wee
Who me? Who's he? They ask with an Uzi and mask
'Bout to stick rap up for a few G's and cash
And I do know the stash
Ash and hash I blow it out underwater like
Fuck cloud 9, I'm so high I'm lookin' down at the sky
Out of my mind
Puff, puff, pass
What's that? I puff, puff hash
Till I upchuck my lunch up fast with the blunts unscratched
Son I'm fast enough to leap a building in a single bound
Number one with a bullet and I ain't got a single out

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
You know
Back to the flow again
The O is in the building, 'bout to make a killing, here we go again
Take civilians, make children, write a ransom note again
It's a dirty job, grand opening
I'm goin' in
Swing one out the park for my city
Them dogs barkin' is with me
They're all starvin', you get me?
Ha
I don't think you do it means we'll scarf it up quickly
And I'm the target of envy
Everywhere, throw a dark and you'll hit me
Aye, I hit the booth the same way I hit the stage
Same way I hit the page
Same shit, just a different day
Rappers are two faced
On Monday they'll be givin' praise
And on Tuesday they'll be shittin' on your name, it's fool's play
The he said/she said shit?
Um, fuck what he said, fuck what she said
Neither one of 'ems givin' me bread
It ain't a riddle kid
Little bit of haze
Just givin' hints, I don't wanna give the shit away
