[Verse 1]
Sabretooth Goon, living tomb, resurrect a rhyme
Self acknowledged coon, monsoon when the feeling's high
A shadow's breath dawned on my long arm
It's hard to speak the truth when they're all trying to sip on Chandon
It's gone wrong, but it seems like the finest
Days of our lives, but the drama's on so timeless
The silence, speaks the loudest from a noisy call
What's behind the scenes is centre stage when the curtain falls
So drop a tear into your pool full of sunshine
No one to trust but this one rhyme
Which is composed by a 15 year old kid, who contradicts the world
Make sure the new age Negro spiritual unfurls
To be at the mercy of someone else's wrath
Is to be at the tipping point, of the social spectrograph
To think a species with so much grasp could turn out to be so daft
Try not to clasp to disguises of the flawed globe
A glitch up in the Matrix is more so
But I swear on Gandalf's beard, and on Goku's shoe
That to you, I will not be fooled
And be puppeteered, and put up on display
Cause when I do it man, I'll do it my way
You can't white out the mistakes you made
When you draw them up off the page
And they're bubbling to the surface
You ain't listen but I know you all heard this
Is this just gibberish or am I doing service
Serve this to workers and make it worth it
Worthless gon' work it, show their purpose

[Hook]
Cause something's got a grip on my soul
Something's got a grip on my soul
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
But all I see is evil, all I hear is evil, all I speak is
(repeat)

[Verse 2]
Killing a nigga or two
Handle my business, hit up these women
Stop at my church by you
Selling that C rock, hold up the weed shop
Visit my grandmama too, stop
One good deed don't put your bad back in place
If ignorance is bliss then wipe the smile from my face
I couldn't sell you rock if you were stoned to your true core
I couldn't hurt my girl if my hands were made from two saws
I couldn't carry weight even if I had like two Thors
All this information too fake, like my tooth's sore
It's internal war what they make you believe
The truth is but a leaf in a forest of trees
You can't even trust your senses, what you hear and what you see
You wouldn't have the right angle if you had 90 degrees, damn
If you can't appreciate what I'm trying to do
I pray most def, you go deaf, before you know death
I hope you notice, I ain't no novice, the coldest..

Ay, ay, ay bring the piano back man

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
But all I see is evil, all I hear is evil, all I speak is
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
But all I see is evil, all I hear is evil, all I speak is evil
Cause it's hard in the medieval
Prospects of good bring torment to the people
And the good is bad and the bad is worse and I feel like dirt
Spilling my soul and end up in a hearse of the cursed and..

Hey stop it man, stop taking out the piano

Cause something's got a grip on my soul
Something's got a grip on my soul
(repeat)
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
But all I see is evil, all I hear is evil, all I speak is x2
