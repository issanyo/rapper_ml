Come sing and dance around the fire that I started where the embers represent everyone of the brokenhearted individuals
That parted ways with loved ones or others who recount that separation as the muse used for their art work
We can argue back and forth about the battle but the war is still so active that it cannot be subtracted from the laundry list of tasks
That should be tackled in a manner where its consequential if it is not described in a past tense
But its Sunday so I really don't care
Give me that a fore mentioned list to throw up in the air
As I'm posted in my chair, I see it floating, well-aware that if i totally ignore my chores I'll end up in nowhere
Easy to say fuck it when your beds so comfy and you have a pretty girl to bring you breakfast and coffee
So you're more inclined to toss these jobs where you toss pee and shit filled chamber-pots  where people are walking
The most lethargic takes advantage to the sabbath
Had to change up while relaxing to the max
So I can manage tomorrow so I don't vanish
Need my parcels in tact so I can carry out my plan to throw a party for martyrs
But I'm too busy caught up in a state of disillusion that if I remain persistent I can make it via music
So I use my day off to create a slate to state I'm human but I end up too distracted then end up not even moving
