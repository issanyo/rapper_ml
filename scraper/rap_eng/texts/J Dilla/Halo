I'm dead broke , so hows about I pony up some poetry?
Holding a symposium. Proposing how we flow to beats
When up at the podium start loading up my focusing
While reading through my poems time how fast the people go to sleep
Rapping via lecture based styles is a nuisance
So I'm trying to electrify the way I use my 2 cents
Laden with way that outsiders may assume
That I'm not up to date with everyone and anyone. It's true
My perennial troglodyte tendencies relieve me
From immediate exposure of the media's indecency
Tee off from my sea loft
Excuse me if I' seem off, but I don't get out enough to pick up any kind of frequency
Decency remained but the tames' long gone
I am wise beyond my years but when I'm out I get carded
It sucks, but still, my own sentiments amaze me
I am pushing 23 but I feel so much like a baby
Check my cadence on the mic is way beyond a novice stature
After taxes with what I'm left with is my quantitative last words
Add em up. Tell me if the sum equates to how much time and effort was invested for a future of success
I want to help those who need it but I also want to sleep
Would love to be someone to listen to. I'm chicken soup for geeks
I proffered all that I had, but giving up declares me weak
So I seek to be considered as a Lazarus on beats
