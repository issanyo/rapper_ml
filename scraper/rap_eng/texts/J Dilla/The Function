[Aviator]
Good morning Mr. Dark Roast
Your boy spit flames like a charcoal
Name another rapper more tenacious
And I'll hop out that spaceship
And turn his ass to cargo
If you suck I embargo
Don't fuck with lame ducks or those arsos
Don't talk over my spit
Or talk about my tone
I'll put in the river sick
Shit I'll do it for kicks
But baby boy I ain't pissed
Hanging with Euro that Swiss kiss kiss
Doublepiping in my kicks
Flashbulbs click
When I step on stage
Cause everything I do is is slick
Shit, ya'll can get it any moment
I'm dressing all black like the Omen
And I walk like this
And I talk like that
Cause I just plain own it
And I just send out fleet
Of white hot rhythm that I spit on repeat
Yo, I feel a special fision when I spit on the street
To all of those who listen cause they dig my mystic
But ya'll ain't gotta honor it or call my elite
The negativity just makes me more tongue and cheek
And baby its a new year
Crunch time is imminent
I get super-gully and I work my obliques

[SuperTanzi]
Really, What's the word kid?
Supertanz to the limit
I keep it real concise
And flow under a minute
But yet it mad hyped so these kids are on my didit
Like everytime we spit something
Cats is trying to mimic
But on the real time
I'm coming with divine flows
Growing like a vine grows
Do it with my eyes close
Hit it like a pyro
You know the function
Everlasting tracks I smash like a pumpkin
But not like, that bald dude
Tracks that I fall through
Are mad deep
As in the Niger or the Amazon
That landscape of beats
Be the planets that I'm landing on
To me kid, everything is just a trade off
Exposing all that fake shit like Bernie fucking Madoff
MC's get laid off and then played like Adolf
Nevertheless I get it off my chest
The best dude, to rescue, the damsel in distress
Yo, flannel is the dress, lyrical conquest
And so I kick it to my man so he can do the rest

[BMAN]
I'm not a pilot, I didn't go to flight school
But if I need an aviator I know who to go to
Matter fact, I think I'm gonna take a trip
And kick it in the thick of this hip hop grit
Inside its applied living
Applications are accepted, but don't expect
Anything forgiving
I'm driven to drive the wheel on your IPOD
Scroll past the Format, you're thinking that's what I want
It's a daunting task
But if you know me
Then you know that I live for a challenge
That is still unasked

Picking wax out my ears as I'm spitting game to a chick
A click in my brain clocks the fear of the lame
As I max out the risking of getting hit
Cause a slap to the face is just a taste
Of the braver wits when the flavor hits
I speak as if I keep a complete sheet
Of my former feats
Not even knowing that there's a thing called defeat
So soak, rinse, repeat and remember
That if your acting as a chump and your acting all tender
The last thing that she'll ever do
Is touch up on your member
You could beg from this July
All the way till next December
So push her up against the wall
And show her whose the man
And pretty soon you won't need to use your hand
