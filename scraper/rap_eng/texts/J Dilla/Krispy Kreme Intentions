[Verse 1]
Just to see if I got it, surreal knowledge
To kill college professors bringing that so called real knowledge
An ill topic, so you can't still logic
But it's still logic, so chill, got it?
I smoke way too much on a laid back night
The clouds were abnormally great that night
Way past life was a voice, who gave me a choice
And told me every day was a toy
Mr. Hamilton, this is your spaceship waiting
Currently piloted by J. Dilla's same music
Music saved niggas, you can be a hero
Use it as a clear goal
Fear no other man, cause any other man will flop
And you're chosen cause you're chosen and you can't be stopped
I'm a fan, I watch
So take these Donuts and go in
There is no way you won't win

[Hook]
What's happening to me, I think I can flyyy
[Repeat in backround]
(Call Dilla, I think I figured my mission now)
What's happening to you, I think I'm aliiiiiiive

[Verse 2]
If my eyes are the intensity of this industry
I got all of these pricks sick of me
A fake simile is what life reminds me of, I don't "like" it
But there's nothing like it
You know what it is, it's t-i backwards
Be I from Harlem, need I practice
I fell off and I'm still at the top of my game
Ask Dilla, I'm a killa when dropping the flames
And I'm chillin while you niggas just copy my name
You can't do it, I admit it, I'm cocky, OK
I live in a bottle made of venom and vodka
You may envision my honesty
Taking niggas a lot of sick days to understand
It OK, no play though, real though, case closed
Same clothes for a few days though
With or without a deal, this is just how I feel

[Hook]
What's happening to me, I think I can flyyy
This is just how I feel, god I'm real
[Repeat in background]
(Call Dilla, I think I figured my mission now)
What's happening to you, I think I'm alive

[Verse 3]
Thought I told you niggas don't touch me
You made it before me, you're so lucky
You won't won't budge me, it's my realm
I held...the Olympic torch
Me and fire had intercourse
I came with the heat
I'm so musical that you can hear my name in the beat
Your dame want me to beat instead of..
OK, I'll kiss her gently and listen to Coldplay
That way the lady won't say I sprayed away
Kids that had Simone's name on 'em
I'm so fast I outsmarted the givers of brain
Now I'm trying to remember my name
It's an issue or a riddle
How I'm spitting the official
Missiles you niggas should listen to
Instead of the shit these niggas is giving you
Take a supernatural shit up in your living room
Y'all niggas is through

[Hook]
What's happening to me, I think I can fly
(I swear I be logging on to the Internet in an Unidentified Flying Object
How fly is that?)
[Repeat in background]
(Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now)
What's happening to you, I think I'm alive

[Outro]
Aw man, I'm only getting tight cause I can't blow shit up
I'm cool though. I'm cool, I'm cool
I'm as diplomatic as I can be till y'all push the wrong button
I said all I had to say
Charles Hamilton

Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
Call Dilla, I Think I figured my mission now
