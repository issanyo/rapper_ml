[Verse: Mikalott]

I find myself lookin back on my youth
I never would’ve imagined I would end up in the booth
I used to wanna tell jokes, make hilarity ensue
Read up on Aristotle, begin pursuin’ the truth
Pen poetry in prose, write a short story or two
And then develop software for the playstation 2
Practice psychology and bite off more than I can chew
By helping people understand why they do just what they do
I was so fucking ambitious
Clever, cunning and gifted
And I haven’t changed much, but I’ve developed different interests
Now I’ve realized life’s about way more than just these bitches
Money, cars, clothes…
You know how this shit goes
How bout living life really chasing down your goals
Or giving back to others what you were given tenfold?
Lend a helping hand, make an impact or a difference
Instead of showing sensitive subjects a lack of interest
I swear these are things that I’m really working towards
When I’m writing all these rhymes, know I’m tryna strike a chord
Letting down the team is what I simply can’t afford
And I’m running out of time to make a certain list by forbes
I’m hungry for it, craving joyous celebration
With all of those supporting my goals and aspirations
I’m careful about who gets more than conversation
Cause I want someone deserving of all of my adoration
Until all that’s accomplished
I don’t deserve to put my feet up
On each beat I’ma speak up
Leave em concerned that they can't keep up
And when the flow speedup
I leave em dazed.. confused
I’m the purveyor of persistence like lieutenant Maes Hughes
And like today’s news, I intend to stay prevalent
Cause when i’m in the booth I’m executing with excellence
We’re all in the room, but I’m addressing the elephant
There aren’t too many out there who can topple IntelliGent
