Check it, you could try to catch it
But I doubt you will so just try to keep up
Ya know?... Look look

Ayo, kevy buss a flow
I keep it running until I buss a toe
Patch it up and get to bussin' some more
Like i'm working the diner as a minor
My managers name is joe
7.50's what he give me, when do I get a promote
It get busier than a ho
Thats been around 3 or 4
Times in a row, only call'em when we get bored
Nigga i'm on a roll like 7 A's
In the 11th grade, man I wish
To busy taking a hit
Instead of taking the time to study for a test or quiz
I was taking the time to roll me up a precious spliff
Priorities crooked ass shit, still crooked
But at least i'm working on'em still pushin'
Like T, I feel cushioned by the beat
So I go a little harder, flow a little smarter
Pack more like a charter when I buss
I'm an artist with the brush like water with the flux
Word play like vince carter punchlines like to dunk
I promise i'm armor tough, mostly my cranial
Mane i'm focused like a monk
Got the motta in the trunk
Ride around like i'm clean doe
Speak formal, everything ain't what it seem though
I ain't never seen dough, bitch I feel like blindfury
Cause when I get to rippin' it feel like the time hurry
Up, like its bout to miss the bus
Or how rappers miss the point when I be pointing at my gut
YAM ! Buss 001, check it cause you can't catch it nigga
