[Hook]
In the club boppin' with my niggas
All of us rockin' on 'em jiggas (On them Mollys)
You ain't talking money, I don't hear ya
You ain't gotta touch me, I don't feel ya
That skrilla, that skrilla, boy, I'm 'bout my skrilla
All my niggas monkeys, we gorillas
All my niggas clutchin', we some hittas
Birds on my timeline, call it Twitter
I'm in the club boppin' with my niggas
All of us rockin' on 'em jiggas (On them Mollys)
You ain't talking money, I don't hear ya
You ain't gotta touch me, I don't feel ya
That skrilla, that skrilla, boy, I'm 'bout my skrilla
All my niggas monkeys, we gorillas
All my niggas clutchin', we some hittas
Birds on my timeline, call it Twitter
That skrilla, that skrilla, boy, I'm 'bout my skrilla
We ain't fuckin' with you niggas

[Verse 1]
I'm coming through, me and all my boys smoking loud
I ain't hearing you, Kodak bring the noise
Every year, Christmas day, I ain't wanna play with toys
Project baby, came from Hot Wheels to riding in a foreign
And my diamonds come from Tokyo, yoin yoin yoin
Power high come from Tokyo, I call 'em ching choing
Money grow on trees, can you show me where you grew that bitch?
You could have a fine ass girl, you'll switch-a-roo that bitch
Boy, you know that Its Lil Kodak, you already knew that shit
I'm bout my cheese, cheddar chip
That codeine my medicine
From the noya, 1800 block, yeah, I represent
I got lots of guap, thats why I'm arrogant (10 toes down)

[Verse 2]
I'm pullin' up on yo' ass, you owe me something
Early morning ridin' round, getting that money
I ask them for a plate, they left me hungry
So I'm out here wildin' out with my youngins
I need that skrilla, this lil nigga love that fetti
I be smoking broccoli, mama told me eat my veggies
Polo down got me in here flexing, call me Ralph Lauren
I was In the projects stressing, I was still riding foreign
And I wrapped my wrist with VVS, and now I'm in here pouring
You know the kid finessin', he's a savage young boy
I took so much of losses, man, it's sad
My mama used to dig all in my stash
