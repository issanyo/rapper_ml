[Verse 1: Myniakal]
Im so, interconnected like Verizon with phones
Its my mind that I zone, like designing the om
Climb through my dome, what you find in my home
Leaves you like Medusa, paralyzed and a stone
All these pilots have flown, past the deepest of minds
Learned to speak when I rhyme, to read when I'm blind
Hafiz with these lines, to compete with these guys
I'mma make it so my family will equally shine
Tryna break into the game, still ain't made a dent
I could pick another job but failure ain't gon pay the rent
Selfish, posers couldn't handle what I dealt with
Your father gone, youd prolly get dismantled like a shellfish
Not sane, feeling like an animal in hells grips
And everything just has to be on cameras to sell shit
Blasting a weapon with this blackened expression
Just crafting a method with this passive aggression

[Hook]
I hope you know, with this music, I gotta get it
Cause if i didn't, then why else would i bother with it? (x4)

[Verse 2]
You ain't feeling my free's? you be feeling a freeze
Zero degrees, revive the real, im a hero at least
Hip hop is dead, I'm just saying it appears to be weak
Missed the funeral service over an earful of beats
Feeling like spider man, words got bad guys mad
Got a striped crew, different from what jack white has
Coming with them wack rhymes, whats a bad fight plan
Why I look so light? I got a half white dad
I'mma keep penning out till theres a cast on my wrist
Then you always wonder why you end up last on my list
Yo, my raps are the one thing I'm passionate with
I'mma go until the game is in the grasp of my fist
Sharper than a hair pick, farther than a stair lift
Claim that you insane? but you bothering your therapist
Yea, I'm washing tons, like I'm fathering Americans
This guy and me comparisons? that oughta be embarrassing

[Hook]
