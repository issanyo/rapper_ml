[Verse 1: "Phantom Of The Synths" by J Dilla]
Blood soaked beats leave em choked up
Reach for that piece and you'll see how to hold guts
Hold up
Wait a minute
Nah time's infinite
Intricate sins win over your stale penmanship
Hmm
Don't tell em bout this incident
When they ask just say
"Wow what a coincidence!"
Go ahead and complain more
I'm still on my come up
Adding more to my list so I guess that sums up
The situation
Claims be one sided
My God I'm blowing up like mines that gone pilot
Uh
Rhymes like jabs to your abdomen
Yanking chains for your passion for strange amulets
I'll bring crack that'll curl your ribs
So
Baby back off when I swerve with no permit it's
Me
Off the hook like dead salmon
Jot down cross country
Like notes ransom (ran some)
Y'all scared of a
Few big words
And a deep voice
Causing y'all to clutch your purse
Big handsome nigga that can
Rap this verse
Now you sitting like
"Damn bruh what to do first?"
I'll tell you what
Go ahead and put the pen down
Y'all be like
"oh he got mic bruh get down!"
Hehehe
I'm flattered
Getting this cake but you're still left battered
Smoking so much my mind's in a rapture
Lazy khakis on chicks she a slack-her (slacker)
Hold it
This cult will start swarmin' like
Bee hives or flies surrounding chopped organs
Woah
I guess mother would be proud
Your mom will start to frown
I'm splittin these claimed crowns
Damn
I just entered your facility
Left y'all pissed off man you gotta be shittin' me

They say: Mike that weeds really good
They say: Yo your raps
They're really good
Don dapper with a 40
I keep it hood
Should I give em what they need?
I really should

[Verse 2: "On Sight" SAMPLE by Kanye West]
Now the way this beaver's flowin is causing damnation
Misbehaving inside of
Sacred sane places
Escape the plane
I'm high as fuck
And this dame's playin too much
She better duck
Before I aim the stainless
Leave her brainless
Bitch was blonde and only cared about
Louis Vuitton
And midget dogs in pink cages
Shit stainin
So here's a tissue
Stop complaining
Now I hope you decided to be complacent
This beat is holy for this
Hellish matrimony
This is solely based on those without those shoes
So run it homie
Stomp & pout about being the best
Should hold your breath
Or stand in the back with a colon cleansed
Collabs equals myself in the post-mortem
Reading the morning paper wishing you were here
Man, I boast boredom
So here's a toast
To those who chose to do the most
And ghosts watching over making sure I do not overdose
I hope this pleases
Even these leeches talking feces
Cease and desist
Lose your whip
And the leases
I'm coming for those you think is God to leave to pieces
Including Ye
I'll drain his neck and drink the blood of Yeezus
