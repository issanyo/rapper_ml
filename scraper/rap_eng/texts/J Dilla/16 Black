Hook:

Back blacker than ever
Coal, King Kong blacker than ever
Black, this is my era

Back blacker than ever
Black leather crow feather
Black, this is my era

(You black ass nigga you)

Verse 1:

Back often
Back and my back against the wall
Come take me and my scars
I got a thick bitch and BMW cars
I do think you a bitch
Thats if you never jumping into your neighbours house, jumping out looking out to be rich
22 years back I was taking shots from white police making me duck and run, never thought I'll be doing the same thing
22 years later I take shots to my similar
The shots I've been taking never coming in singular
Self destructive
Swallowed a pool, smoking something
Corrupting the government easy when you got cover men tryna me please me
I'm confident the pleads be on table, copping them til the judge frees me
I bark knowing where my teeth be whether you do or dont believe me
I'm 2016 black skin

Hook:

Back blacker than ever
Coal, King Kong blacker than ever
Black this is my era

Back blacker than ever
Black leather, Crow feather
Black, this is my era

(You black ass nigga you)

Verse 2:

Back often, back with a vengeance
Running into every jail inside of fences
Running into every jail, come out, jump back in it
Thick bitch, I spin a BMW windows tinted
Police batons bust me
Gender opposite wearing the tightest clothes never trust me
Must be a sin burglarizing my neighbour house leaving the basin
Lord I been gimmicking niggas in the place I'm in
I play God by deciding which life has to cut
Son, look at your dog acting like a mutt
Ignorance is bliss
Jumping into your house, jumping out holding enough to break my wrist
Should've got barbed wire fence
In my defence, easy entrance always provokes my offense
Whether its big house, 4 corner house even tents
Name is 2016 black skin

Hook:

Back blacker than ever
Coal, King Kong blacker than ever
Black, this is my era

Back blacker than ever
Black leather, Crow feather
Black, this is my era

(You black ass nigga you)

Verse 3:

Thick bitch on my sides
Never been a surprise
I roam big in streets of Westside looking demise
The animosity in my residence is cloning
They making me into a killer for niggas who ain't coping
I bring trauma to foreign businesses on my corner
Trauma by looting
Part of my trooping, I'm a soldier guarding my insecurities by feuding
22 years back I was aching
Nowadays black pain is what I be making
My name is 2016 black skin

Hook:

Back blacker than ever
Coal, King Kong blacker than ever
Black, this is my era

Back blacker than ever
Black leather, Crow feather
Black, this is my era
