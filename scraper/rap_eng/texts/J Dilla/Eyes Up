Jay Dee (eminem's voice from a Dj cut)
Say, (h-, huh)
My jam knocks, we knockin motherfuckers out they damn socks
Remastered it's the S of the Pad Lock
Been makin money, I been had a fat knot
Been loopin up the shit to make ya head nod
You say (wh-,what) my jam knocks
You can hear me coming off the damn blocks
Since a kid I ain't never played wit damn blocks
And I was never ever known to cock block
Like jealous niggas that must wanna get socked
Them niggas make me wanna cop a damn Glock
You say, say, say (huh) my jam knocks
These ladies know, Jay, can make the bed rock
Be hittin like Bam Bam, in Bed Rock
Compare the S to gators (navigators) we them big blocks
We stir fry mutherfuckers like a damn wop
Rock and rule niggas like my man Mop
So when my band rocks, watch the bands flop
You say (h-huh) my jam knocks
You can say the S is the soul shock
The soul shot known to make 'em shell shocked
When devinous cats used to pop locks
I steal, when I used to pop locks
The S twist shit up like a dred lock
You say (h-huh) my jam knocks
You say (w-what) my jam knocks
So keep ya

Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyes up
Where you at, where you at, where you at
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

It's like again y'all
Uh huh, uh huh, one, two

Uh huh, uh huh, one, two
It's like makin money's critical
Rhyme written, lyrical
Some emcees will never know
What we keep on giving and
Makin music beautiful, and we keep delivering
Y'all niggas to the fall
And I ain't forgivin it, I should do some ill sh, like, like
Break your ligaments, then you would be feelin shit
Known to be doing shit, and if you do some shit
Know who you fuckin wit
Never fuck around with the click
Don't fuck around wit the click
You might get ya melon split
Uh huh, again y'all, uh huh, one, two
It's like uh huh, again y'all, uh huh, one, two, it's like

Chorus
