When I was 9 man I held my first gun
My mother prolly shocked this is coming from her son
Just another flower that grew from the flower patch
But its different when ur raised up in da slum
When even raul's doing more time than he's bin alive
And I got beat up for lamarni but I didn't cry
Oh such a bitter price to pay for being real
N wanting friends to squash beef
But its cool I keep it chill
Coz I take it on da chin but never take it to heart
Shout out my brudda pep see im rating ur bars
A hood hero a hood star is what u are to me darg
I know u wanna put da world in ur margeries arms
And joedel we were tight cuz
So I'll hold u down for life cuz

Biggie sample : and if you dont know, now you know


If we ain't hug da same block or scuff da same breers
We really can't relate coz da love just ain't there
My blood remains clear trust retains fear
Its mad coz u man couldn't catch up in eight years
I seen niggas switch sides like it's half time
Shoulda known they were fraud like a card crime
Having a hard time tryna get my cousins together
Coz they got issues and im just stuck in centre
See there's a girl who's one of the prettiest i've ever known
I'll tell da world with a megaphone
Coz I dnt see why u dnt see why I think ur amazing
That in itself is an understatement
So all that killing urself shit it gotta end
Coz I may not be ur man but i'll always be ur friend



And to u niggas that stole my bike its still fuck u forever
