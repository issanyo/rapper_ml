[Verse 1:Schama]
Wait do you feel that? I feel a great disturbance
Oh, it's just Schama on the mic but don't get nervous
The repetition of courage
My excellence is confirmed with the messages of my sermon
Meticulous as a German...scientist
Greatness surges through everything I invent
When I'm in the lab things tend to get quite intense
Influencing the world with positivity is my intent
I'm Daniel and the world is just a lions den
That I've tamed with my righteousness
My judgements never cloudy through the rain or the li-ightning
So embrace the enlightenment
That the monks and the saints and the bible gives
The word of God is my vitamin
The world is scarred with it's mindlessness
The earth revolves around violence and it's vice and sin
The curse resolves when we all praise the most mightiest
Murder all, no mercy not even the slightest bit
Serving y'all, publicly flying a private jet
First of all I'm a combination of viruses
Third of all, we skipped seconds cuz it ain't rhyme with this
Urgent call from God he told me I'm the brightest kid
Under the star that gives off the ultra violets
All my bars make me realize why I exist
Because im legit and had a shine within since I was 6
Or probly when I was younger
It's Schama the most triumphant
And honestly I am coming with sonic speed to accompany
All the dreams that have run from me Socrates
He could learn from me
Follow me for eternity
Schama be the best , yes he is certainly
Yes he makes the earth indeed spin on its axis perfectly
And I'm not even perfect so just imagine a perfect me
Im a dragon attacking all of these rappers assertively
Scratching them with my talons I deserve a turbine please
Oschama bin Ladin always disturbing peace
More poisonous than the element of mercury
The burden on my shoulders is heavier than mercury
I go harder than the skeleton of Hercules
So good luck with relatively hurting me
Ever since birth he was like medicine to the Earth you see
I smell like an angel cuz I'm heaven scent
Burry me inside of a pyramid when my life seize to exist
And donate my organs to a music facility
Who's this? Resembling an emperor who's been ruling for centuries
Y'all can't see me so it's best If you let me be
Teacher said you can get an A, so why would I let you be?
Ill sting you if you don't let me be
With my thumb and index finger, ill leave a legacy
