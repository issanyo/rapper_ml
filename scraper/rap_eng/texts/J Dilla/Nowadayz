What, I just wanna lay you back
Nah, you ain't gotta count my stack
Nah, it ain't goin down like that
Damn yo' ass is fat
I just wanna hit it, and quit it, if it's on like that
If I ever have to call your back
Cause you got a man, and I got a woman
But one ain't enough I need more to keep me comin
And I'm, runnin away, cause it's time to play
Nowadays chickenheads all wanna date a DJ
MC, sport star, nigga with some mo-ney
That means locked down.. girl laugh like that shit's funny
I wish some of these broads cooked better than they look
Cause nowadays, they get you hooked, overbooked 'til you shook
Niggas look, and learn for your own concern
These broads heatin shit up on mosh I burn
Down in the projects, or even up in the hills
Shit's real, these women want money and deals...
Yeah, get paid

"Now you know how it is brothers and sisters
When two brothers and sisters get to fightin
Them motherfuckers get killed! Damn right
How they go at your ass for BLOOD!
You better damn believe it baby
They don't fight like they're fightin a stranger
No they're fightin to kill baby
And that's a damn shame, cause that..."

Nowadays your boy probably tryin to hit your girl
While you tryin to work to buy the ho diamonds and pearls
Fo' sho'~! It goes down like the girl on her knees
Tryin to please every nizzle gettin drunk smokin trees
While you 9 to 5, 'bout to 25 to life it
That ho on some sheist shit, cause you find out how trife it's
The way it is, all she wanna do is swallow kids
This hollow dip's out to lunch all up on a trip
A nigga like me ain't even got time for it
Cause I ain't givin up shit unless I want to give it
Niggas slave to the grave from the weak down to the brave
Smart to the stupid gettin stuck by Cupid
Nowadays, clock G's, ain't got time for deez
Fake dumber than Louise, even though they OOH-WEE!
Nowadays, nowadays niggas smile in your face
Havin friends is a waste, detrimental like a nigga ten pace
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...
Four... (YEAH!) three....... two.............. ONE!!

Yeah, uhh, here we go c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
