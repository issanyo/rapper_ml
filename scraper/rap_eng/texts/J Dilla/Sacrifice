Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend
"How I'm a get it" mentality that my mama gave me
The devil busy trynna shake me with the drama lately
Bills with no job relying on these rhymes to pay me
Society trynna marginalize and modulate me
Trying to homogenize me word to Ronald Isley
I'm the mind of a Dalai Lama mixed with Mohamed Ali
You can't compare a Maserati to a Subaru
A 1000 times down the turnpike the one in New Jeru
Tolls and gas money Po is a crash dummy
Speeding straight into a wall my life flashed in front of me
Floor swept from under me riffing off was written off downhill
Cruising on neutral with the ignition off
No plan B or no seat belt no sleep felt insomnia for weeks health
Declining my speech melted the monitor Extreme not a moderate
I feel as if I'm stuck in a dream and can't get out of it
Suffocating in the moment and it's claustrophobic
Hustle aerobics what I feel inside my gut is hopeless
Immobile if I can't move how can I become a mogul
And how much more Can my soul body and mind go through?
But like Goku growing much stronger from every battle
Flabbergasted still spitting head inside a lasso
Never bashful when it comes from me it's masterful
Leave casualties I got the faculty to clap at you
Scratch that actually I'm showing gratitude
For my mama not giving birth to an average dude

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend
Been on a mission ever since the legend stepped in
This world invested in these bars I repped and I served
Gave y'all my best work trying to get all I deserved
Increased my net worth from the way I peddle the words
A rebel upping this level never settle for less and
I'll never stop until you mentioning my name with the best
The greatest in the flesh put haters to rest gave em the business
'Member I'm one of the best ever did it, Trust!

Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend

Bar bulimic not hard to believe it I'm marching like I'm Jesus
Inside the garden of Eden within I harbor demons
Carpe diem carbon copies wanna be him
My sneakers scuffed up and still the shoes you wanna be in
Built a mausoleum for Zombies who tried to see him
Mind of a Liam in Taken I nonchalantly G'em
Nothing but trickery the shit they try to spit to me
We don't agree so let's agree to disagree
You at a lesser degree I grow aggressively
Your indirects is weak shooting blanks hysterectomy
Let me be direct they should direct their checks to me
My rep grows exponential check out my trajectory
Matter of fact you don't deserve to stand next to me
You could never understand my life and its complexities
Started from nothing and my rise was incredible
Chip on my shoulder my sacrifice unforgettable

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend
Been on a mission ever since the legend stepped in
This world invested in these bars I repped and I served
Gave y'all my best work trying to get all I deserved
Increased my net worth from the way I peddle the words
A rebel upping this level never settle for less and
I'll never stop until you mentioning my name with the best
The greatest in the flesh put haters to rest gave em the business
'Member I'm one of the best ever did it, Trust!
