Verse 1:

I never was a nigga that was addicted to triggers
My momma died, left me bitter, but i never started to deter
I'm too fuckin paranoid to trust a nigga and his word
Got the crisp herb, blunt makin my lip burn
Not Big Worm, but it's Faison
AKA The Sapien
AKA The Rapper That You Caught Fuckin Your Lady Friend
Take notes, bitch
'cuz I've been cold since Russia started some Cold shit
My flow's sick, got gold-tipped pencils puncturin' tracheas
My goal is, to leave a legacy that lasts millennia
And hella henny, bruh, pourin' enough to quench Poseidon's thirst
I'm in the presence of bad bitches and mad bitches
They all bitches, took a lot of shit from their man's Richard
(that means dick)

Verse 2:

This is that halotosis, flow
Like the ocean, moses
Parting the red sea, bled green
Swarm like a locust
Upping the dosage of the dopeness
My lyrics are potent
And my eyes are gettin redder as i hit the dope shit
But i ain't trappin out the bando
Ain't playin poker, irrelevant if the hands show
Spazzmatic start static faster than Rambo
But i'm a black man in the future just call me Lando
Double S sweaters, super saiyan written on the back
My power levels infinity never holding back
Matter fact, got the z-warriors and we make fuss
I'm high grade like my blood type, it's A plus
A plus
A plus
Mini fridge full of 40's not touched in 8 months
I got a quarter but i'm only rollin 8 blunts
Kick you with the force of a thousand and 8 punts
So come and test this
We are the bestest
Shorty got two D's for chestses
I'm feelin her breastses
Beast with the math like i'm PEMDAS
My money, I spend fast
My team is on the pedestal
Your crew is in dead last
It ain't a problem if somebody isn't fond of me
I'm an oddity gettin' brain like lobotomies pardon me
Arsonist when i'm sparkin' the L's longer than AK's
And just a decade ago i was playing with beyblades
I may slay these rappers like pat bateman you bastards hatin'
My team is ready to give your niggas some lacerations
Some lean and vicodin and i begin to feel amazin'
It's blatant, I am The Sapien breakin' the matrix
