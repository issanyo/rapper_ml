I read something the other day that said ''you won't be able to recognize your loved ones in heaven''

How sad is that..  anyway

All you have is who u are and what u give
I give more than I get
Chris in overdraft
My love has put me in debt
I adore and respect people with no guilt coz in my thoughts I reflect
On the lies I told my grandad
Coz he still thinks that im studying
A man who can barely see, sees my potential
Ive been drowning in the waters that im muddying
See I got so many bars and a heavy heart
They stabbed me in my back it was very sharp
Still panicking my blood pressure has gone all da way up all da way up like remy ma
Im always tryna help i swear im always tryna help
I can't even help my fucking self
Its difficut being lost and so lyrical
Looking to the skies like God i need a miracle


Let me empty my mind and empty my heart
