[Refrain]
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
Been such a long time
I forgot that I was fine
Just kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck

[Hook]
If you want to feel me
Better be divine
Bring me water, water for my mind
Give me nothin'
Breathe love in my air
Don't abuse me
Cause these herbs are rare

If you want to feel me
Better be divine
Bring me water, water for my mind
Give me nothin'
Breathe love in my air
Don't abuse me
Cause these herbs are rare

[Verse]
If you want to feel me baby
Better be divine
Bring me water for these flowers
Growing out my mind

Give me nothin' just be gentle
Breathe love in my air
Use me, don't abuse me, love me
Cause these herbs are rare

If you want to feel me
Better be divine
Bring me water, water for my mind
Give me nothin'
Breathe love in my air
Don't abuse me
Cause these herbs are rare

[Hook]
If you want to feel me
Better be divine
Bring me water, water for my mind
Give me nothin'
Breathe love in my air
Don't abuse me
Cause these herbs are rare

If you want to feel me
Better be divine
Bring me water, water for my mind
Give me nothin'
Breathe love in my air
Don't abuse me
Cause these herbs are rare

[Refrain]
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
Been such a long time
I forgot that I was fine
Just kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
I want somebody to walk up behind me
And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck
