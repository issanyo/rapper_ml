[Verse 2]
Holy shit I'm choking
Combat
I'm the king of mmblaugh
Why so mmblaugh?
You had me at mmblaugh
Life is like a box of mmblaugh
Movies make psychos more mmblaugh
To infinity and mmblaugh
We all go a little mmblaugh
Frankly, my dear, I don't give mmblaugh
Love means never having to say mmblaugh
Everything the light touches is mmblaugh
I got a fever, and the only prescription is mmblaugh
I'm also just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to mmblaugh

[Hook]
I'm black

[Verse 3]
I've got a golden mmblaugh
Don't care how, I want mmblaugh
Come with me, and you'll be in a world of mmblaugh
You stole fizzy lifting drinks, you bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get mmblaugh!
It's our problem free philosophy: mmblaugh
It's hard to say it; time to say it: mmblaugh
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right, just mmblaugh
We will we will mmblaugh
Teach me how to mmblaugh
And she's buying a stairway to mmblaugh
My anaconda don't want none unless you mmblaugh
If you like the way you look that much, oh baby, you should go and mmblaugh
Tale as old as time; song as old as rhyme: Beauty and mmblaugh
Oh, we're halfway there, oh-oh, living on mmblaugh

[Outro]
I'm black
