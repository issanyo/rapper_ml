The streets told me "go on let the song play"
Like having sex in the missionary position with Lisa Leslie
They fuck with Crook the long way
Nobody can't stop the Frank Sinatra, did it my own way
Unless Im doing what Im ought not
In the Beamer soft top, getting more head than a bald spot
Or Alopecia
They be sucks with a cough drop cuz thats Lakesha
Fly fashionista after my balls drop
Im telling them "bye" like I asked Felicia and the call stop
Cuz she was scheming me
Back in the day she ain't even believe in me
Didn't have that Neo Soul glow that'll let know that I'm thinking on a higher frequency
While life was pitchin that kitchen sink at me
Since my date of birth the world were trynna sink the king
Cash your first stone, I turned that bitch to a pinky ring
Man it's what you think
It's what you think it mean
Now a sleeping pill addict
Drinkin' lean couldn't sleep on me in his deepest dreams
I'm waking them up with the wisdom thats age old
When I got the Uzi chopper I'm Uzumaki in sage mode
Cuz niggas think they buffer than letting the page load
Till they see how many muscle-deflaters the K's hold
This is exactly what all the people waited for
Me kicking the door with the skill level that I'm hated for
Is it the cadence or is it the methaphors I painted on your brain before
The punchlines silence you like "say no more"?
How can typical spitters ever
Deal with a serial killer lyricist mixin' murderous materials
Like a psychotic chemist who's infamous for snatching souls and leavin' you spiritless
I ain't rapping my spirit is, this an out of body experience
How bad i get serious, and talk about Trump fucked up politics with the Syrians
You wanna ban immigrants? Start with your wife
You wanna end some bullshit? Start with your life
I'm on your head forever cuz you rep the birther movement
Dog whistle for a black man could never be legitimately in power
In your eye-sight and that's real though
Nah I ain't digging you pussies and that's dildo
You racist fuck, catch me outside how bout that?
But you gon need a different doctor than Phil though
Nothing that I make is generic
That's why the gold on the watches rose like Jalen and Derrick
That's why these rappers look funny as Will Ferrell
Standing next to a real pharoah who's able to sit at the table with merit and a gang full of parrots
Everybody repeating each other
I'm ashamed and embarrassed in pain and disparage
But im a soldier, ain't from this era
I got my game from the barracks
Until the art form its the death do us part boyyy
The same is in marriage

[Bridge]
Whoever of y'all select, whoever y'all call a threat
I just wanna know where they at y'all
Cuz the gang in the Slaughter jet but there's no surprise

Like [?] coming out on the fact that water's wet
They pissed off, they all upset
Wanna hear something sick, dog? Call the vet
It takes the science of cryogenics to shit talk with me
Ice got me froze, only wrist colder is Walt Disney
You mad? Swing, if y'all hit me
I'ma find a space on your face to make the counter fit like a false benji
I'm just tryna purple your mouth
I been on the kind of beefs that make you circle around your crib
Cuz killers lurking about to put holes on your curtains and couch
Now it look like Yeezy furnish your house
Catch a murder and bounce, I'm tryna escape hood living
While entertainers embrace it after they make good living
Shit is backwards, I told Section 8 good riddance
I'm still with the shit but it gotta make damn good sense
Don't get me wrong I'm not against llama packing
All of the drama had me stagnant, I had to bench all of them practices
[?]
To commence dollar stacking
Now I'm global when I be local due to the French bomber jacket and the German sports car
Look at the chicks I'm attractin'
Mercy, they be thirsty, but it's dry around these parts
Bitch I'ma cactus
Desert 'round here, beat it wit your wackness
In my past life I was on Cleopatra's mattress
In this life I deal with neoraptheatrics
Dumbers all the way down around ground zero, that's the tactics
Yeah, they dont want these beats to survive, right?
Look at jazz and all the people that keep it alive, like
Ralph Moore [?], he's a genius saxophonist
How can our genre survive if the weakest rappers own it?
Think about it while it still allowed
And while it still some MC's around who tryna make Dilla proud
