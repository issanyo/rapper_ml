[Intro]

[Verse 1: Swami Netero]
This the beginning of a new age
Peace to the old days/
When struggle was my homebase
And sadness was my soul's cage/
The bars were built from cold rage
I couldn't get free/
Filled with so much envy
For hearts that weren't empty/
Was drowning in the sensi
So I could feel content/
Drinking til I'm feeling sick
To numb the pain's the real intent/
Cause I was never healing it
Running from the facts/
I could never handle that
The past's the past and that is that/
Depression was the aftermath
I couldn't find some peace/
But once I tried to write to beats
I felt it's where I might succeed/
Now I'm on the grind to be
The most respected yet/
Ain't rhyming to collect a check
Cause all that brings is extra stress/
So you could have a mess of jets
I'd rather feed the poor/
Go and give the streets support
Cause I know they need it more/
Greatness what I see in store
Once I leave the sores/
And score a sea obscure
Explore in search of greener shores/
The problem's I can't seem to ford
I guess I'm comfortable/
I'm, sure what I'm running from
But don't know what I'm running to/
I don't know what I'm going to do
I'm feeling stagnant/
This advent to break attachment
And be renascent's/
Harder than I imagined
But I made it here/
So I got to shake the fear
And pray to God the way is clear/
Even if the day is drear
I got to make the move/
I know I'll make it soon
And praise the day I made it through/
