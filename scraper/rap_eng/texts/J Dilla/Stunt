VERSE 1

fuck your opinion

I don’t need your approval, baby

you should keep it pushin’ now

just a swing and miss, you aint pullin’ shit

and I really can’t believe the audacity, don’t you play with me…

damn, fuck you think I am? careful what you sayin’

'cuz you gon regret the day you ran that slick mouth, right

(I’m right)

PRE HOOK

you talking bout some shit you’ll never get to do

tryna get me on some stuntin shit, I’ll stunt on you

tryna get me on some stuntin shit, I’ll stunt on you

I’ll stunt on you, I’ll stunt on you

I aint that bitch

(an enigma, I’m not like them)

and just when you’re getting kinda comfortable

I-I-I

HOOK

I switch it up

just when they think that they know me

I switch it up

and when they finally on to me

I switch it up, I switch it up (switch it up)

it u-up (switch it), it u-up (switch it up), it up

I switch it up

(switch it up, switch it, switch it up, switch it)

VERSE 2

not like the rest, don’t fit the mold

(I stay on the low, straight scheming)

go save your breath, aint down to roll

(y’aint even on my level, stay dreaming)

PRE HOOK

you talking bout some shit you’ll never get to do

tryna get me on some stuntin shit, I’ll stunt on you

tryna get me on some stuntin shit, I’ll stunt on you

I’ll stunt on you, I’ll stunt on you

I aint that bitch

(an enigma, I’m not like them)

and just when you’re getting too comfortable

I-I-I

HOOK

I switch it up

just when they think that they know me

I switch it up

and when they finally on to me

I switch it up, I switch it up (switch it up)

I switch it up

(switch it up, switch it, switch it up, switch it)

I switch it up
