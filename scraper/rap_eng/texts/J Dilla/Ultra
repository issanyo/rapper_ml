[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

I'm not cocky but I know who I'm better then
If Rap was High School i'd be the jock with the Lettermen
And that's only cause Hip Hop is a sport to me
Scratch that that's my life nigga fortunately
I make real shit while they sound like porch monkeys
If victory taste sweet I was born a smore junkie
I can do anything that I set my mind too, Times two
I spoke to god she said that i'll assign you
With a talent, you deserve it
You got a way with your words and I noticed that you been hurtin'
I put you through everything for a reason
It was a test and honestly I find myself pleased with
The results, you got heart, got brains, got a voice your music is Mozart
To these people nowadays but they don't notice the art
When you were born I gave you the gift of a golden heart

(Hook: And thats the same reason why I ask do they listen when I leak it from my cheeks up in the lab, do they listen when I leak it from my cheeks up in the lab, do they listen when I leak it from my cheeks up in the lab(2x)
