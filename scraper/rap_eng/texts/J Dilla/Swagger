[Verse 1]
Wow, I'm in the middle of O.C., keeping it PC
But I got an apple with a Diet Peach Snapple, chillin'
With the lizards on the feet
Listening to the wizard of the beats, Jay Dee, get it right
I know you see the diamonds sparkle in the light
Because I'm dark they wonder why I shine so bright
With the wife so tight
Which face you wanna see, girl: the top or the bottom?
I'm actually talking about the watch
But you could sip this Henny with the rocks on the bottom
Yes, I fuck with socks as long as you fuck with cocks
Oh shit, duck the cops (err! err!)
They can't believe that a brother this clean living his dream
May be a dream it seems
A nigga with a clean record and the cleanest jeans?
Yes, I got the Beverly Dewitt Yancey, Maureen's genes
Yes, the nigga cool, best for breezies only to tease me
Make your fake chains look greasy, go back in the house, uh

[Chorus]
I got the awesomest swagger, so hearty and sexy
Yes, I'm a singer-slash-rapper and does my thing
And yes, I swing my bling, it ain't related to the music
And yes, bees, they sting, but I love smelling good
Yes I do 'cause that's what I do
I said I love smelling good
Yes I do 'cause it's what I do, baby, yeah
I said we love smelling good, that's how we do

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is me, who you see
Do you see me plus two is three, is us
Now she see you with me, disgusted she will be
And the sunset we will see together, forever
Through any types of weather
Damn, you fine, girl, I like the way you sport that leather
We look like superstars, yes we are
We've come very far
Yes, I had to come back to the rap
Back with the flapjack smack talk
Run through your city like an Amtrak
Y'all still in the amniotic sac, I just turned 21
Blackjack, clack clack, get your team smack smacked
Pass that blunt to Lady T
We get money easy like ABC
Like 1, 2, 3, Motown, 313
I don't do yoga but I yell 'go single' with your girlfriend

[Chorus]
I got the awesomest swagger, so hearty and sexy
Yes, I'm a singer-slash-rapper and does my thing
And yes, I swing my bling, it ain't related to the music
And yes, bees, they sting, but I love smelling good
Yes I do 'cause that's what I do
I said I love smelling good
Yes I do 'cause it's what I do, baby, yeah
I said we love smelling good, that's how we do
