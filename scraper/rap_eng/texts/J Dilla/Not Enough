We need to work, But you don't put no effort in/

You just be like fuck it, I should be like f it then/

But Fuck it, I just put more effort in/

You said you heard I'm Cheating, you just want confessions and the truth/

I let it burn,(Burn burn burn.) Smoke on top the stove top/

I Told you i was different from them nigga's i just showed you wrong/

I'm high I'm getting lifted I'm over you until the drop/

You dropping calls (calls,calls,calls)

You dropping everything we had, I guess you had enough but/

Me I'm feeling empty and me I'm feeling tipsy/

And then i drunk dial, your sober so you diss me/

If you wasn't I'd be fucking you, your putting up a front till that

Liquors coming over you/

And me I'm stopping by, and i bet you love me then/

Again its fuck and bye, and then we isn't friends/

I guess i benefit, i mean you, your fucking crazy

But there's fucking with it/

So I'm fucking with it, she's fucking with it,/

You don't fuck and miss it, the way i miss it/

[THT KID Jordan Paul Hook]

I guess this ain't, Easy!. I guess we're Just falling off/

After everything we had, after falling hard/

After everything you said i guess its not enough/

It ain't, Easy! I guess its just not enough/

I guess its just not enough, After everything we had i guess we falling off./

[Verse 2, THT KID Jordan Paul]

She said the truth is, the truth is, Then told me something ruthless/

Something about them side niggas, And what they doin'/

She was doing dirt like shia and his shovel do/

I, Shrug it off keep it off before my mental state succeds/

And then im eminem, ya kim. I'm leaving dead bodies severed like I'm Edward/

You i save for last, im dying seconds after that, Cause I'm your romeo,/

I'm feeling crazy girl! I'm playing chromeo/

Your sweet Like candy girl! and im the dentist/

And you got cavities, but we can get this/

[THT KID Jordan paul Hook]

[Verse 3, Ray Lyle]

I guess there ain't, "Easy" Ways to say it,/

All them times that we had in your room when we was cakin'/

You was layin' it down, cause you were layin me down/

When i told you i was leaving wasn't playing around/

I guess its just, "Easy" For me to up and leave,/

Then sit and stay cause in the end you couldn't fuck with me/

I gave you custody, reluctantly took it/

I'm sorry you couldn't read me, wouldn't let you cause i booked it/

And see im stuck on the past, and now I'm sorta passing you up/

And i asked you to understand. guess i wasn't asking enough/

And i wasn't asking for much just someone to get me passed it/

And i wasn't looking to last, should of told you that, i needed someone here to distract/

And i couldn't do it alone i was hurting here all alone/

And you always knew what to say so i have to thank you for that/

I wish it could of worked out different, but you was something man i told you that you was different/

Like someone i never met, and i probaly never will again/

But i guess will meet again if its his will again/

Its "Easy" said then done to say get over it, had to cut you off and cold shoulder /

Thats why they call me jacky frost, and i didn't really intend it must of got it from my pops/

Really have to thank you for listening, but they way my ass had left me got me missing him/

And i ain't feeling you, it could be worse/ im just sorry to leave you hurt baby/
