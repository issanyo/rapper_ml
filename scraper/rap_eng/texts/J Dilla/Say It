[Intro]
("Say It")
I don't know man
I don't know if they really wanna hear this shit
("Come on") alright
("Say it")

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the sacred, Dilla ok kid
Shit's tight like a size smaller than your waist fit
Winter in America, when this nigga blow
Step into get your face spited, it gets cold
But it's all beauty in the belly
In summer when colors let brothers spoon it and the jelly
They love us
Cooking up them sauces from the sources that's above us
Butter between the bread so I don't bust on the covers
Legs pumping on the spread, I'm on the cusp with some mother
Let it rain off the brain, it's kinda tough with them rubbers
Call cousin like, "what up with it?", cut with the cutlass
Back on the clock of running motherfuckers and numbers ("Say It")

[Samples]
"Whatchu wa-wa-want?"
"It's the 'Raach with a capital R-a"
"[?]"
"It's the 'Raach with a capital R-a"
"J Dilla"
"You'll see all these rappers"
"So whatchu want?"
"With a capital R-a"
"[?]"
"Watcha gonna do?"
"Say yes, yes, y'all"


[Verse 2]
Say it, lay it out for 'em
Not a day goes by without the foursome in the whoredom
Record something to it, beef it up and make it sound stupid
Future's looking bleak on some "Mo' Better Blues" shit
That's when niggas with no cheese or dues get spitted on your cellular phone
I left a message for ya, "cut it out you're selling them clones "
Niggas is outside buggin' out, you're jailed in your home
Hail the dopeness, the focus is back
Watch your life sail hopeless off of sofas and snacks
Too surface, being nervous is closer than that
Pulled off into the abyss you're being chose for the crack
For that performance y'all Martin Lawerence, Otis on rap "(Say it")

[Samples]
"Whatchu wa-wa-want?"
"It's the 'Raach with a capital R-a"
It's a wrap
"[?]"
Nobody tell ya?
"It's the 'Raach with a capital R-a"
"J Dilla"
"You'll see all these rappers"
"So whatchu want?"
"With a capital R-a"
"[?]"
"Watcha gonna do?"
"Say yes, yes, y'all"

[Verse 3]
Holla, holla, back, back at it, at your own discretion
Niggas busting hardhats for they own protection
Closed contested stance, game over
You a lame soda, we bubbling man
To the top 'til it pop and the plan
Bring your glass to it, shoot I put the pain in the champ
From the D to the city with bikinis and sand
But Dilla Dog put me up on all of y'all in Japan ("Say it")
Dilla Dog love Japan
[?] love Japan
OXOX in Japan
We out in Japan
