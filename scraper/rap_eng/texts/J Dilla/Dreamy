(wake up)
Do i disturb my life or live more clement?
Sometimes i just want to stay more like cement, cuz it’s always more dreamy in bed
If I know i know what’s right, why ain’t it doin that-right?(what? )-livin up big- cuz its more dreamy in my bed
Is it worth sacrifice for the princess, shine like a white knight and get sex-  i think its more dreamy in my bed
I have to see despair, reap nefarious heads, preach against death, teach to end ignorance, rinse sins n repeat again out there- or i can just rest, watch from over here cuz its alot less scary- more dreamy in bed


I'm in a world stuck between oppression and kindness
Do I Choose a selfless life go onto a quest to end suffering
Or better my own with selfish indulgences
This is no common sense regime
A government of the people
Only the agenda of the elite
A small percentage misrepresented by their many monies- (built off lost memories of a lost people depleted fo economic reasonz)
Remember (thoo) every single silver lining has its edge
May I remind you to recollect what is your quest again
Ever since deference we've reached Absolom perfect
Well come now you're welcome to seek the absolute best
With us we're all gone dieed off the sess
I've done said it again, i don't wanna be your man i just want a bitch with a bigger butt, I smoke alot of zigazags
Tho Thankyou for helping me stay human acumen, lumen ruthless
No matter what I said
When I was at unrest
I tolled/told a lot about myself
But This January 7th
I'll celebrate an anniversary of false self- an annual remembrance of reveling amidst death
The only security imbalance is that there's less love than bliss(not terrorists)
Thou sense of salutary can now only couple with lucre for all you who outnumber true men
And u bitchez that think u have made it with a made/maid man, check again, I think his real name is Benjamin

Frankly! I doubt u blind to this
But listen this Christmas witness the drop of the mix
An Introduction hottest since nas
Spit on breaking atoms
I know this and im convinced I'm the opposite of fission
I discovered a lot more than scientists
The secret that perturbed them
Curbed christians-Nuclear fusion
When my rap heats your eardrum
You'll feel dumb
Numb as cats whose dome pierced with steel slugs
You have nothing to fear Cuz
Cuz eye hear/here and 1ove and I don't judge
I make up for insufficient fundz with no fucks
The system bust abut at the point of terminus
About time that the turmoil is expunged
Make way for peaceloving
To Put everyone at peace shud b governmental duty no. 1
But what can I say, is there a difference if I shout my voice across mountains its all yall whose actions amountain to
Which path I'll go and society as a whole
Yo I say we pave to the road
Don't regret let destiny take over
We'll be left dead for sure, pickings in the  open (fo vultures)
So I stay afloat, hope for gold,  smoke more than doctors daily recommended dose
Then say out all these daily deity messages I wrote
Ay Please don't go..(evo1)
