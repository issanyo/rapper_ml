[Intro:]
Whaddup? This Illa J
Yaknow, Yancey Boy number 2
Just chilling here yaknow
I just wanna know, yaknow
If you've ever been in this situation before
Yaknow, relationships. Uh, check it

[Verse 1:]
This is what happens every time
I'm just walking down the street and find a dime
I try to spend it, but nah it's all over my mind
And I just can't get rid of it
Fuck it, it's over, I can't do it
I can't believe I did it, I'm fucked up
Now I'm dealing with a critic, but nah we cool
Every time we sex, I takes her to school
I gives her the blues, the way she put it down
I can't refuse, I know love is pain
That's what I choose, I got the love jones
While getting our grub on, while getting our club on
Jacuzzi tub on, with the bubbles
I tell her I love her, all the time
I got to show that affection, every time
She comes home from work, we gonna make it work
We gonna make it work, I know things will work out

[Hook 1:]
Why do I fall in love, every time?
Why do I change my mind, every time?
Why do I repeat myself, every time?
Yeah
Every time
Every time, every time

[Verse 2:]
Every time I fall in love with a verse
I play it over and over, in my headphones to surpass that skill level
The next day, new clean cut lyrics, like a fresh fade
That's a part of my personality
Sometimes it's hard to say it's over when it's over
Don't know what you got til it's gone
The brain to a Range Rover, but it's always in the shop
Pondering about the days when, we were way closer
Please answer your phone girl, can I come over?
I'm willing to step up and take responsibility
For my actions, how could I ignore our retraction?
Fact is, I'm still in love with you
In love with you, last night I wanted to comfort you
I couldn't get any sleep, up late
Thinking about not drinking, to stop my heart from beating
How could I be cheating? And then I think: "Ugh"
"What if I start treating my queen the way she should be treated?"

[Hook 2:]
Why do I cheat myself, every time?
Why do I hurt myself, every time?
Why must I repeat myself, every time?
Yeah
Every time
Every time, every time

[Hook 1]

[Outro:]
Yeah, it's your boy Illa J
Yancey boys once again
I got a question though:
Did you get it?
No forreal, did you get it?
Haha yeah
