[Hook]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause ya never know when you're gonna go
(repeat 3x)

[Verse 1]
When I put the pen on the pad
I start to think about the past
Like why you had to go so fast?
It's too bad that the good die young
Just kids from the slums
Stuck like a pit in a plum
All we know is break buds and drink rum
Pick up guns
And by any means multiply ya funds
Before bread gotta live off crumbs
Anybody is a victim
When it comes to income
Young, dumb
Just niggas actin' wild
Need a couple tips like black and milds
From the hood where women outlive their children
And you ain't a real man
Unless you dealin', stealin' and killin'
I'm here to tell you that's a lie
The rules you live by is gonna be the way you die
No God's or Allah's could stop these guys
I hope these rhymes help open ya eyes
No facade
I lost my mans to a sick dream
It hit so hard man
The kid was only 16
He didn't even live to plant his own seed
What sucks most man
That could've easily been me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
As I write these tracks
I feel ya spirit on my back
Tell me do better, go harder
Let the hunger starve ya
I'm in the games like Katniss
A nigga can't miss
Aim for the big apple
Never mind the pigs
Tryna' trap us it's apart of the plan
NYPD the new Ku Klux Klan
Stick it to the man
That should be the number 1 priority
My president is black
So why the fuck we still minorities?!
It bothers me
What's it gonna take to stop authority
Kids are getting killed for spinning wheels like pottery
Pardon me for speaking the truth
They're destroying the youth
Starting with the blackest berry with the sweetest juice
Vigilant too but then I ask
What would Jesus do?
Stay in the booth
And keep ya hands up so they can't shoot
Keep ya hands up so they can't shoot
Stay in the booth cause
They wanna shoot a black man
God damn Uncle Sam!
And put a band to the knuckle hand
I won't stop till' we're free at last
Free at last
Thank God almighty we're free at last

[Hook]
