[Chorus]
Boy, keep your head up high
Look up, you'll see that I
I just want you to know
The struggle is so beautiful

[Verse 1]
Even when we feel like we trapped stuck in the cubicle
Need money, rent due, she's phony, him, too
And they ain't even thinking 'bout the trouble that you went through
To keep your head up you trying to avoid the feds
And you operate on love, you ain't tripping about the bread
Shit, she gotta get it like this was Christmas, you Santa Claus
And when you get it all the fine ladies get at you with panties draws
And that ain't all, family first and the poochies ain't gonna holler when you get in the hearse
Let the drama disperse, keep your fam up high
And the Devil's gonna cry, I don't mind lil' buddy
Boy, keep your head up high
Look up, you'll see that I
I just want you to know
That you are beautiful

[Verse 2]
Boy, you better go in for better, no matter, it's on me, the weather
You so far in leather you never let up
Your fault to get up, you gotta believe in the bigger picture
And don't diss the drama 'cause karma may come back to stick you
You know who your right hand and know that no '
Come up, the pain here, to ball up, to ball out
That bring out the better and my mother's tryna get us out the ghetto
'believe me, you gotta keep your head up

[Chorus]
Boy, keep your head up high
Look up, you'll see that I
I just want you to know
That you are beautiful

[Verse 3]
It's a beautiful day, you start off the day
It's something that we don't usually say
'Cause it's usually hate for words that we speak
Sometimes these fiends won't keep away
We get distracted so easily but frequently we lose'
But we gotten to a point where we don't doubt
We got control, look at us now

[Verse 4]
We just wanna make our families proud
Tryna win some bread 'sometimes we hit the jackpot
We hit it from a mile away 'family love and we know it
Ain't nobody talking, everybody eating'

[Chorus]
Boy, keep your head up high
Look up, you'll see that I
I just want you to know
That you are beautiful
