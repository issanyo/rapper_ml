(Intro)
It's your fantasy
It's your fantasy
It's your fantasy

(Verse 1)
It’s like there’s no future it’s back to the 90’s
We kick it back like Nike
Ya on my inner nerve just to spite
It’s fine with me, ’97 to the death of me
Reminiscent to beneficent the years that were gold
Talent no malice is the way I was told
To react to this doomed society
I’m a lower class citizen trying to convey the truth not coward
As we proceed to give you what you need
Ain’t trynna blend with your heats and your motherfucking mainstreams
Atonement cause now it ain’t common when
A Spanish nigga like me make it in this rapping shit
It all happens when your ecstasies collide with your fantasies
And motherfuckers really trynna get at me (ahh)

(Hook)
Trynna mess with me
It’s your fantasy

(Verse 2)
I’ve been working 24/7
Deliberately delivering this heat before I reach the heavens
7- Eleven, where my niggas chill, we pac rhyming, shot calling, tech wailing, money stalling
My peoples know where they land in my circles, we rise like totems
B.L.P I thought I been told them
My nights be chilling then thinking then cold and blow out your mind cause the guns I ain’t load them
Sticking straight with plan B
Being someone nobody thought I was able to be
Ya ain't’t able to see
The two to third eye be supreme
Wu Tang Clan nigga whoop that C.R.E.A.M
Nigga troop his team, as they rooting envy
And I be that emcee, spitting shit ya can’t man handle
Grip the grain, niggas be dripping the oil no candle
Considered a vandal
Ain’t got time for none of your scandals (ahh)

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
In a backpack
I got to act right, think act nice, so difficult
And acting so weekend, with anger and discontent
Ya niggas really think ya have a chance really mess with this
Ya niggas ain’t know it’s us, ya niggas ain’t know it’s us
Its motherfucking B.L.P
Nigga take a stand, motherfucker raise your hand, motherfucker understand
Yea and ya niggas really wailing out for money and fame
Think that after this it’s going to be the same
Make you see reality, hit you like a cavity, you can’t mess with this originality and
Ya niggas saying fuck me
But ya telling everybody but me
I’m above the bullshit that runs these days
Real nigga for life mane every day
Always keep the game straight no matter my persona
Drinks on me Latino style like corona
Young nigga attitude so come holla at me
BlacLatinPride keeping shit real guarantee (ahh)

(Hook) (x2)
