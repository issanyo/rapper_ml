[Intro: Q-Tip]
Come on, ma, we got to make things right
Sometimes we really need to make things right
Come on, ma, we got to make things right
It's the Abstract, baby, got to make things right

[Verse 1:]
Talkin' 'bout a revolution, or maybe just a change of mind
Working on my constitution, I began to realize
I've been doin' wrong forever
Trouble was my favorite game, yeah
Breakin' hearts I thought was so clever
But, I'm the one who got hurt playin'
I never could see it coming, no
Never could feel it 'til its come and gone
But all of that don't mean nothing, no
When you're all alone

[Chorus:]
Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness
Sometimes, sometimes

(Gotta do right, gotta do right, ahh sometimes)

[Verse 2:]
You're lookin' at a transformation
That's brought about a change in me
Love's a brand new situation
Never have I felt so free
'Cause I can see it comin', yeah
And I can feel it callin' louder now
Lovin' is so rewarding - yeah
When you let it out

[Chorus]

[Rap: Q-Tip]
Hold me down, ma, your man could be a little while
Sometimes I need the love to get me open
'Cause I'm hoping that we can make it peaches and cream
Intervene inside my dreams with your high class theme
Got me splitting at my seam like a fat cat gasping
I'm asking can you marry me and saying I'm asking
Sometimes a fella need to do the thing that's right
Whether it be making love or holding a mic

So come on, ma, we got to make things right
Sometimes we really need to make things right
Come on, ma, we got to make things right
Sometimes we really, really got to make things right
Come on, ma, we got to make things right
Sometimes we really need to make things right
Sometimes we really need to make things right
It's the Abstract, baby, hold your hand wrapped tight

[Chorus] (2x)
