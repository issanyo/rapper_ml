Intro:
Badmonting, badmonting
High sadity, dity, dity

Verse 1:
Always on my high siddity shit, no im serious
Couple doobies in the ashtrays, still delirious
The highgrade keep those highgrades, Told u I ain't failing shit
Puffin loud, distorting ears, when I walk around. See the tears, smear on your peers, causing crowds to frown
Got the finest Sellers , asking me for a few pounds
See I sense, the frauds, with these senses, yall past tense, leave you where I last pissed in or trespass
And get your chest capped, oozing like tree sap
A raptor in the latex, ask your ex, she felt rapture, at that apex
So See the semen in the sheets, im a seaman in her seas, oh see man, she was screaming, as I breached
Agree man, i was reachin where u couldn't reach
Geesh, it's just so hard to do favors, for ya peeps. They plucking the grey hairs before you leep, I need a snow bunnie for da keeps, so I look for the hares before I sleep
From hill tops, to the chilled blocks, all I hear is hares, lookin for open pockets, where the karots rock
See the sneers pop. My pockets dust bunnies, so they always run from me. Can't you tell, the scrilla is what appeals, next to the pills
Flipping sides, so what's the deal, head or tails
I'll show you real, Unlike props on film, oh chill , u can't tell me to be real, when lifes surreal. Forreal
I'mma snatch deals you intersected, you introspected ,by your decimals, don't expect to be tested 
Where your headed. Down to da tombs, I made room, now you doomed, dillan out , boop baps like mf on shrooms

Verse 2:
From the block to the tops, always had a doobie, cooling on the porch, watching these cruel streets
Old scenes to new schemes, these new scenes, seem to scheme on your old dreams
All fiends, and demons on caffiene, eager to wreck, what seemed
So seamless, when I see green, eco machine, so you know I go green, by all means
Oh please, I unzipped her tight jeans, and button seams. Pounded clean, she creamed, so you know I did those nice things
She even got me Icecream. So serious, no siddity shit, but I get the chicks, like when robin thicke hit notes with the highest pitch
Bucket hats on tilt, eyelets all sealed, from da smoke I spilled, take a look , irises watered, like i been swimmin with da seals
Prevent a crisis, so I pop eye drops like pills, so i don't have to deal, with moms, looking at me like I gills
