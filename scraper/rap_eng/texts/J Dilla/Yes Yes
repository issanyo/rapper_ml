[Intro: Jay Dee]
Straight out the headphones

To the beat rough and rugged about to rock

[Verse 1: Illa J]
Yes Yes, put my snipes on the target Wes Wes
Leave this girl alone rest rest
I wanna be in her world just just
Cause every time she put it down it be the best
And after every time we get down less stress, Yes
(Bring this shit back just like)
That, she wanna ride me like I'm a Cadillac
Cause she that diamond with the diamond in the back
And she love the way I'm rhyming on the track
Yes she loves the way i spit, how i fit in the pocket

[Hook: Jay Dee]
She wants to be on my shit
Ya girl wants to ride my dick
She wants to be on my shit because knows you can fuck with this

To the beat rough and rugged about to rock
Yes yes y'all and you don't stop

[Verse 2: Young RJ]
Young J they say the rich bastard
Cause I come through with two in dip fashion
Cartier's and J's and buff glasses
Babes they op they legs they freak nasty
I just take her face I'm so classy
Got two to take her place a babe magnet
Beats and breaks is hand crafted
No mistakes in them crates ya bitch asses
Taught by Dilla the great that's Mc Nasty
Whatever stay killing them plates an assassin, creed
Give em Dick what they need they so catty
The cream got em stripping they jeans they love Daddy

[Hook: Jay Dee]

[Verse 3: T3]
SV we da best we ridiculous
Ask Dj Khaled, Static plus bitches
We problematic to you battered ass niggas
Peep the lines, ain't no lies jotted in the sentences
16 bars plenty raw stylistic
Fix these broads they on bars they ain't gymnast
All in the drawls for the friction
Looking for the logs, special admission
Gonna have to squint to see another niggas vision
Cause if y'all killing shit I bring it to existence
Keep six broads, six large , i'm senseless
Cigars, sick cars, chauffeurs pimping

[Hook: Jay Dee]
