[Verse 1: Memnon]
Some people think I smoke too much, but
I think I smoke the perfect amount
And my girl say she don't have enough cleavage, but
I think she got the perfect amount
You see its all about perspective
The eyes from which you view it
Example?
My little cousins think that I'm the coolest
While at the same time my parents think at any point that I could lose it
What's the truth? I gotta choose it
I come down to the house they like, "Wassup Mark, how you doin?"
"What's the newest shirt you got?""You wanna freestyle?"
The glitter, in their eyes is enough to topple a tyrant
But then I got the fam
Fuck, where should I start
Finish your degree
Your not the same person that you used to be
And we just can't get used to it, I'm angry like a...
Native American searching for white settlers
With tomahawks, seeking reparations for a destroyed nation
But I try not to let these tangents break my concentration
I gotta stop the people who planted seeds of pacification into plantations
Fuck waiting
Moroccan beach houses and Buddhist temples await me
I smoke weed
Cuz it awakens me
I write these simple rhymes
Cuz they maintain me
A couple of video games to entertain me
So if I seem like I don't give a fuck then don't blame me

[Hook]
See I've been giving zero fucks man
See I've been very busy giving zero fucks man
And if you want then you can spell it with your hands (just like this) x2

See, See I've been giving zero fucks man
See I've been very busy giving zeros fucks man
And if you want then you can spell it with your hands (just like this) x2

[Verse 2: Memnon]

And all respect to Steez when you hear me on this song
It hit so hard that I needed one of my own
I mad as fuck dog, I'm at my wit's end
I'm hitting rock bottom
I've got no car, no job, no money and no degree
See I don't even have weed
It takes a strong motherfucker
To escape from the struggle
I'm defenseless as a Muggle
All in the machine like some Snuggle
Shit
Phone on mute like its got a muzzle
Until I look over and she'd challenged me on the Ruzzle
It's the simple pleasures, see its the small things...
But she knew I had a bad day, she could have let me win
But see its all love
Baby its all love
See I'm just having some Emotionless Thoughts
And see you stayed up on the train even when the motion had stopped
And now its all aboard
Yeaa see now its all aboard
See I done seen a few things that's gone wrong in my life
That's why I took my shaking digits and I forced them to write
They wanna steal my jumpshot and be the boss for the night
But imma block it, play the D, and force a drive to the right
They wanna steal my sunshine and push me jive to the right
My heart drops when I see those eyes drop to the right
Cuz I can the web that the lies you tellin spinnin
Making them old pictures pointless like a new television
See its the real shit I'm spitting
And sister you better listen
And brother you better glisten
Cuz if not, get enlisted and quickly
Cuz it ain't much out here for a nigga that
Dress and talk like he "white" but looks like he's black
So to sort through accusations it's gon take a sec
To show you haters what the fuck can be done with a rap
