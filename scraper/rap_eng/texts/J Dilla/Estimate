I remember the day that you showed your ass
Full moonin, wolf nigga transformin
Burnin rubber, that get you nowhere fast
You doin stupid shit so that these whores can swarm in

See when Baatin say he got yo' back, you better trust
You know you fucked up, tellin rumors on my crew
But fuck the dumb, you gotta estimate
Before you tell a lie on the 7-88, 88

You told my man to come and get it
And when he did it, you fronted on his ass when you did it
You won't admit it, yet you know you bullshitted
Yet you walk around town like your shit is sweet scented

And in a minute, niggas intend us to get in it
I recommend this, estimate it
Don't false advertise us no need for pretendin
To be someone you're not when you can't hide your feelings

YOUR TRUE FEELINGS~! Cause you can't hide your true feelings
I get the feeling, you got devious intentions
Actin like a Willie when you're just a Sir William
Cause you're hollow on the inside cause you got no feelings

You gotta estimate yo' fate yes you in touch
You wanna be down, but your crew is all in it
My city's Motown, my crew is Slum Village
Macknickalous niggas don't give a fuck about image
We bustin jams on the ceiling

We is the, hey it's the, we is the
Hey it's the, ahhh-ahhhhhh

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch out there like that
If you don't want her out there like that

Don't put your bitch...
