[Verse 1]
Bling, bling
Keep me on shine while I make the ching ching
You so precious, like a burst of joy
I heard your boy Jacob got the best shit
You so hot you make me hot
Boy, and he's got you 'round the whole watch, boy
And so expensive
But well worth it
I heard it's a Dilla that rents some
It's so ugly when the ice lit
You with me, the feeling is priceless
Since the jump had a princess cut
You know, lift the cuff, the wrist lit up
You so beautiful when you in the row
It's something awful, what you do to the prose
You ain't guess then you ain't listenin'
I'm flossin' with my girl's best friend
Shinin' with my girl's best friend
I'm blindin' with my girl's best friend

[Hook] {x2}
When I raise 'em in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' with you until the end

[Verse 2]
Bling, bling
You with the whole team, get the pearls on the ding ding
They see the shine, they eat it up
They see the flow, but they can't see the time
You so sparkly
If you ain't a part of me
It's like the Rockets with no Barkley
You so hard, I'm getting 'em there with no prob
I mean the women give me gold stars
Oh Lawd!
My sleeve is freezing
Had these pro's knees weak, please believe it
You so special
You multifacetedfacetted, you can cut glass with it
It's so brilliant
Go spend a little dough, look like you sold millions
Plus you everlastin'
And drastically important when sportin' your ghetto fashion
You ain't guess then you ain't listenin'
If you stay glistenin', shake your wrist then
Just shine with your girl's best friend
Ride and blind 'em with your girl's best friend
Wildin' with your girl's best friend
It's D.I. and your girl's best friend

[Hook]

[Outro]
When I, in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
