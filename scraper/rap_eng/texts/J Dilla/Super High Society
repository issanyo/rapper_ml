[Verse 1: Batmann]
Stepping outta the spaceship 3-piece suit, wine in a glass
Sporting a red and black, shamballa bracelet
Homie we take trips, daily to the place where comets fly
And I wouldn't come down, even if you paid me, mutha fuka you crazy?!?
I only got my bros up here, a bunch of bitches, and some dough up here
This dark maze still shines a bright light, but my road remains so unclear
But I hold no fear
These intricate words, and verbs I be spitting
Plus the knowledge of this earth, makes my words so appealing
Cause since birth, I was blessed, with this curse that im given
And I'm tryna make it first to convert to this healing
Meditation and recreational drugs, enhance the thoughts of educational thugs
Release the minds of barely capable scrubs
Often varies, but never tarries, in changing all the hatred to love
So I am patient cause my faith is above
And with my patience im complacent I'mma patient to this world of no hugs
Can't be taking all these fakes thru the mud
That come out stressing, and second guessing, I just showed you the gate to the love

[Hook: Batmann]
Come fly with me
And lemme take you to the super high society
Get high with me
Who do you aspire to be?
Come fly with me
And lemme take you to the super high society
Open your third eye so your mind can see
Arise, this is your time to dream

[Verse 2: Batmann]
The mindstate of a nigga that once lived and then died
Handicapped and was blind, all my views from inside
My insight, brings inner light, to the youth that reclines
In the chairs of the groups that break the roots of the spine
So I ain't tryna diss you, cause I was stuck in the system
So you really don't think I know that ignorance is blissful?
That everytime you grab a rose you still might grab a thistle
And the person that you love so much, don't even miss you?
Yea homie I know, these are some of the issues that flow from your soul
The one's that are boiled up and you can't even control
You turn into a villain and you terrorize the globe
Now you out screaming for hope
Uh, somebody help me, I'm living in depression and I know that shit's not healthy
I'm talking to your soul, I hope you mutha fukas felt me
We chase this cheese like a mouse till we wealthy
Hiding from the D's, so a nigga moving stealthy
Ambition turns to greed, I hope this green doesn't posses me
My shawty rolls my weed, then proceeds to go caress me
You can't dance with a G, if you moving with two left feet, don't test me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Batmann]
Free your mind, don't sleep among the locust
If you ever reach your peak, your mystic can be like Moses
Fuck the counsel of the weak, take your seat among the hovas
Not the slackers or the jokers, your the master of your motives
My mind seems to expand in the nighttime
And when I write rhymes, I speak to people who are like-mind
You gotta move intelligent and find the right grind
Before they got you locked up in the bing, and you recite rhymes
So now you sing? I didn't know you in the choir
I spit, what's in my heart, what's in my soul when I'm inspired
And I only speak to God, I tell the devil he's a liar
When you facing heat you fold, it's like I took you out the dryer
Are you Mariah? why you marrying that Cannon
If a nigga get all crazy in a second you can blam em?
Bob, you ain't a builder cause you carrying that hammer
And you can not hold this wisdom if you never understand em

[Hook]
