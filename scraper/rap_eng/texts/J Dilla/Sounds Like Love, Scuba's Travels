Things get confusing, we get distracted and become confused
On a path asking what to do? drops of rain hitting like thoughts consistently
And endlessly, Brainstorm above the norm, abnormal thoughts
Liquor and weed provide the mix of what my perspective is
How I perceive things in this confused view, it's the idiot tube when I view what I do
Still Im amazed and amused, by these visions in blue
Reactions to Unconscious Distractions
Lacking action in my thinking, Missing reflection in my actions
Its like i dont know who I am, In this world Lost
On my path hoping for blind faith, but walking blind like Im avoiding the light
Something's got a hold on my soul, my moves 1,2 1,2
My brain's not a computer, and I ain't perfect
I make mistakes and mistake my purpose
Things that I value ofcourse, then become worthless
And Railroads Deep Circle surface mental
I build in my dreams and travel while awake
Awake in a DreamState was the reason for #SubmarineOperations
And now that I have that as the foundation
Why am I here, Waiting? or am I just wasting?
What's patience without perseverance?
I fear the path before me, and truthfully Im glad Im scared...
Cause I believe it means something...
Blind faith has been on my mind, but what am I putting my faith in
Real Love involves blind trust, but what am I putting my trust in
And As real as this could be, should be, and would be, I can't say I'd be shocked if it amounts to nothing..

Comfortable sleep is the only time I have peace, and its the cousin of death
The room is spinning while I lay down with one foot on the ground
Trashcan full of my fluids and I'd rather not mention it
Theres also a water bottle or two, and a flyer from church
And I add that in there cause truthfully, thats why Im hurt
Im hurt cause the best of me is in the trash
