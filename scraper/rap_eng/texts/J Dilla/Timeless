This is. Beyond Words
Jay Dee

I'm climbing heaven's stairs praying one day i'll see you there
Be aware of the faithful people who are there because they care
I look up- to the sky. I see a dead bird
If I told you that I miss you, would u say "Oh Word"

Like our game is tight, aight. I'm really needin the mic
Ever since we called it off, all I did was mentally write
I got tired of being a liar indwelling in sin, it began
I want to say at our best man's funeral she sang

I'm having fantasies of wiping out each other's memories
Lyrical thieves following me, while she swallows adam & eve's
Average Joe ain't know that the average ho won't
Be there or care when hes down and out. Don't

Bother learn to honor your father
Slaughter, those who you fathered
What is up? why did us have to crush
I'm analyzing times in 09, in a rush

To bust flows no longer written, too many styles bitten
To MC or not to MC, inside a meth lab kitchen
What you thinkin? my bars is structured for guitars
Mellow- tones referencin baritone bars to the stars

I don't want to look back, and say I didn't give it my all
This is crazy it is, I'll catch you when you fall
It's deadly, i'll die trying to change the World
It's heavy, on my shoulders. The Love I had for this girl

Timeless
