[Intro]
Yeah
Uhh

[Verse1 ]
Such a beautiful scenery
The best farmers couldn't landscape the greenery
The fragrance of lust is in the air
Getting [?] by the [?] nature brought us
Charmed and allured by the world's daughters
This [?] shouldn't be illegal
Please don't call informants
Stripper looking at me like she love me, mmm
And I'm damn sure falling for it
So let me make you an offer gorgeous
If you can be the soil, I can be your cloud
Making rain for you, keep you aroused
Take me to the back and do whatever is allowed
Cause I need to be your only crowd
Let me pay your tuition, cause I know you a scholar
Heir to the class graduated honors
Damn you a genius, yeah

[Hook 1]
Move your body like it's voodoo, snake charmer
Snake charmer, snake, snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer girl, you a snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer girl, snake charmer

[Verse 2]
Possessed by your perfume
I'm in your possession
Got my stick figure moving like cartoons
I'm guessing, I'm not the only one you do this to
But I'm a rare breed and I'm new to you
The gigantic alveolars, your face says sex
You would be the worst at poker
Sky turned black sort of like it was eclipse
She knew it was a star, put it on me like a wish
Ugh, she got the drive of a locomotive
Get up on my lap baby ride like a roller coaster
You got to be the baddest in the galaxy
Tonight we got to take it past fantasy
Cause I'm seduced by your motions
The way you move your hips got me under hypnoses
Like some collar lust potion, you should gone let the sun warm up the ocean

[Hook 2]
Move your body like it's voodoo, snake charmer
I'm seduced by the stale Bill state [?]
Move your body like it's voodoo, snake charmer
You a snake charmer, snake, snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer girl, you a snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer, snake, snake charmer

[Verse 3]
The look, I see you looking, of lust is in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
The look that you could never hide
Yeah, damn such a provocative escape
She said she go to college, get a doctorate in May
Well I can be your scholarship, the dollars on the stage
Just call me the economist your monetary safe
What kind of trans am I in?
Sorcerous it seems I'm enraptured in sin
Captured again by the essence of your aura
And I just wonder hows the oral

[Hook 2]
Move your body like it's voodoo, snake charmer
I'm seduced by the stale Bill state [?]
Move your body like it's voodoo, snake charmer
You a snake charmer, snake, snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer girl, you a snake charmer girl
You a snake charmer, snake, snake charmer

[Outro]
