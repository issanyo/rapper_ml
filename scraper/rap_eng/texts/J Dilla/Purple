[Intro]

It's Dukes

[Verse 1: Nia Duke$]

Chilled in my room I be writing these tunes
It's all I do or I'm with this chick she rolling a dube
I be hoping to see this revenue, shows out in Paris and Venice too
With better views and better food
Cause we seem some mad shit, its terrible
Picked up a few bad habits that I never knew
Im telling you
Lighting these fumes yo I be alone
Another night on my own
I'm in my zone no set backs so leave a message after the tone
I prob'ly won't get back to you
I got a lot of things to do now
Other than that man its just me and this chick
Down in the garden watching birdies and shit
She rolling up and then we burning them spliffs
Puff puff pass
Damn this burning my lips
I take a hit
Damn i needed this shit
I know your momma go'n hate me for this
But you see my heads not in the right place so we taking a trip
Down to the astral realms where ignorance bliss
'Cause I've been tryna be the greatest but these niggas don't believe me
I had the determination they say put it on your CV
Too alive to work a nine to five I fly like ET
The stages and the TV is the only time you see me
Cause I've been in the studio working on albums and EPs
She says she wants to see me but i only chase my dreams see
And you know i keep it real, so I only have to be me
Nobody else
And if them niggas don't wanna help do it by yourself acquire wealth
I plan to put my team on
I do this for the V ones, the V one Z
Yeah that's the team and we all chasing dreams but we dont sleep
So I proceed
To kick back with the homies and blow trees
I'm listening and spitting shit to dope beats
See there's a whole world out there i got to go see
So on the low key I been writing these rhymes
Maybe one day ill shine
I'm just taking my time
'Cause I'm a make it in time

[Bridge]

I said
Tell 'em that we up next nigga
