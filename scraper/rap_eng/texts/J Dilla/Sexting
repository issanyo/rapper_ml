[Chorus: Taji]
Not trying to take a phone call
Not trying go out or do nothing at all
I just wanna know, what, what you're like in bed girl
I want you to know
I want to fuck you

[Verse 1: Different Note]
The intermission
What is missing my future misses let's get it kicking
Those minds fickle stuck in pickle yet they dissing
This garden is full snakes hissing
My eve on December of forgetting
(Chivalry is dead) so madam may get some head
Cause dome is good for thinking and for bed
Sexual said you're mine don't ever forget
It's hard not to perplex why you're not complacent on making my
Bed a mess
Please my Mary lay and confess
Sins aren't written in stone
Whether gripping my bone
Wanting some cream for your cone
I promise to never fucking leave alone
To the bed pass the aggression
If we not knocking boots than we sexting don't be forgetting
This infinite text message we sending

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Different Note]
Into a mission
It's fiction to say that I don't be missing my missus when she ain't on my neck giving me kisses
See I'm bad at  this relationship shit
It's hard not to miss
You
Yes my heart and my balls are blue would you please give life to the two
In between our loving I wrote and smoked the pen
You
Gifted those bitches tripping if they dissing us two
We know da truth
Tell em the truth
Line of groove blacks lips and finger tips chill as we see L move
Hips and heads banging to C. L. Smooth
Ain't I smooth
Most of your partners shoot quicker than fool with a deuce deuce
Love is war and sex is sweet tool make me disregard a truce
Battle ongoing we never give in
Took you for a ride and your body and mind spin
Darker the berry sweeter the fruit and you got dark tint
Mixing our juices and energy
I nail you you correct hammering away with my inner G
So many hard Christians swimming in a sinner see
We keep it G
I'm a OG and you're so deep
I'm so deep

[Chorus]
