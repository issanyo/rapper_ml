Why do I feel so lost? (x2)

[Verse 1: Pat G]
Do you prepare for things or fix them as they come?
For right now you ain't gotta deal none, baby
We're gonna see what happens in around a month, lately
Things are changing, we just don't get along
From how I see it you need time take some
I'll be here waiting for my time to come
Not overconfident just know I'm the one, you need
We could start off and push it along
But all I say is

Why do I feel so lost? (x4)

[Verse 2: Pat G]
If you care so much about it slow down and take your time
Good things come but there's no waiting in line
Stop worrying about the passing prime
People like me will see and come to find
That after you begin there is no wasting time
Best is yet to come and that keeps my faith incline
But this beat so sick can't help but catch the vibe
Going in with the flow for bars up on the lines
Easy to say that the game is officially mine
Taking off on the track can't help but hit rewind
Didn't know much about me back in the day
Right here in the pocket is where I stay
I'm talking the QCA it says it on my license plate
I cannot complain with matters of the heart on my brain
Tryna live the life that they won't attain
So much potential I'm going insane
Coming up and creating my lane
Don't know if my position will ever be the same, ever be the same
