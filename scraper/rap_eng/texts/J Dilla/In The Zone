[Intro Thoughts]
I'm running wassup thoughts bruh i feel mind running away with me
Turn my headphones up, okay
Wassup wassup huh huh
Let me take you on a trip you ready? You Ready?

[Verse Thoughts]
Feel like i'm running
Looking at my current situation
Life feel like its passing away
Wish could spread dove wings fly away, fly away
Till then i'm smoke this endow and stay high day 2 day, day day
Smoking blunts till my lungs black
I'm trap in room
Crying like a cop in a room
Boxed in situations
That's pass over due
Since i jump off the porch
My mind been fucked up
Guess i lucked up, lucked up
My words is my therapy
Coming from bottom like 6 on the clock
My pain remind where i alt to be
So no need  to choke up
Only way is up like 12 on clock
And time don't stop
Hood remind who i use to be
Just know i'm ready to knuckle up
(wassup)

[Hook Thoughts]
Steering out this window
I have no place to go
Im running round in circles
Making my way a home
Smoking this endow
Got eyes low
(2)Done Got me in my zone

[Verse Thoughts]
Every time i pull up
I rolls up
I'm so lock in
The key stuck ignition
I'm always in recognition
Head in the clouds smoking kush blunts
On my way to the top/ i do what i want
Be so high have brain racing to ceiling
I be cooking like your favorite uncle grilling
So im guess im who they blame
Women fake, niggas hate, its all the same
Yall mad cause yall lame
Im topic of disction
On my to fame/pop bottles because part of the game
Its a shame
Looking for that woman that's asking for that sexual healing
Because she know my name, know my name
And its Shawn Thoughts
Never take another thought
First and for most
I'm that nigga everybody achieve to be
Want to be, but you can't be me
Profit state of mind
Money over time
Im running
Im running

[Hook Thoughts]
Steering out this window
I have no place to go
Im running round in circles
Making my way a home
Smoking this endow
Got eyes low
(2)Done Got me in my zone
