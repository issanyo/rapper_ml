[INTRO]
Uh
This is what happens when you bust some live shit to start rapping over
It's going down, and everybody needs to get in
Fly girls, hey yo you gotta get in
And to the ... I know you wanna
S.V. is in the party making shit happen, party people, you gotta get in
So you can

[HOOK]
Rock to the rhythm, forth and back, forth and back, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back, forth and back

[VERSE 1]
Money don't make sense
Believe me when you get it, it gets intense
I gotta make the music for the ladies and gents
I gotta get the money, all for paying rent and
Off a payment, I thought about it (say word)
And if it ain't right, don't try it
We are masters, like NASA to the
Astronaut making sure this shit's hot
Yo, if it's not, my man you need a pit stop (this guy)
Women giving out the... (unintelligible)
She said she likes the way we ride with them fat ass thighs
Oh, she's probably seen the ranger up in the parking lot
It's alright though
Let's go

[HOOK] x4

[VERSE 2]
Since I was young, dumb and hung
Hard to believe and hard to breathe like I'm missing a lung
It's all foggy, (nope,) let me through the fog!
Crew missing bad Snoop and Nate Dogg
Gotta get it where I fit in, and sit in, put my business
Standing as a man in the land of the forgetting
Hard to realize, 'cause it's all televised, and I
Made a young brother have to open his eyes
I had a little bit of this, a little bit of that
And a whole lot of money I missed, but
But without that whole lot of money I missed
I mean Kurupt wouldn't rock like this
With a knot like this, now just rock

[HOOK] x2

[VERSE 3]
Slum Village's gonna ask no less, the marvelous
Do what you do, to handle your business
Get in my face and yes, you're gonna get checked
What's wrong with you? Don't you got some respect?
Maybe, I'll invade the place where you rest
Didn't wanna, so consider yourself blessed
Call me the specialist with rapping finesse
I came to chill, I don't really want to flex
Just searching through the party for some ladies to get in, screaming
It's the... Hey y'all, it's the S-Town, with the party
It's alright, we suggest y'all

[HOOK]

[VERSE 4]
To the people in the place (what,) having your do done
I speak the best word about my crew
'Cause we been through a lot of shit to bring to you
Music you get up and dance to
There's a lot of MCs who think they've got flow
But it takes the rhythm and the rock and the crackle and a
Popping MC, jive nigga Slum on the D
E, T, I, O, I, (unintelligible)
Don't you get (unintelligible) about your time
Guess who, a nigga's back, Motown
To my crews from the West Coast, y'all prime
Errol Flynn, you know how we get down, down, down, down

[HOOK]
