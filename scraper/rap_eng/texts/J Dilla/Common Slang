I'm saying rest in peace to Jay Dee
When I'm dropping colder than a deep freeze
Leaving MC's frozen like some red meat
There's no controllers on these mean streets
I hear a fogey feeling lonely when the queen speaks
The older's green weed, I light my rizla when the king size slim
Licking the [gin?], quicker than fucking spin dries
Chew tobacco like the cowboys down in Shanghai
Truly wacko loony snatching up your franchise
{?} and minor fractions, digital criminals
LIke cyber hackers, chemical liquid spills and biohazards
When I pop it like a cherry it's the end of many
Hollering a policy of comedy like Lenny Henry
Comfortable as Simon Cowell in designer gowns
Flashes and bangs like gangs of bikers down in Chinatown
Every day I've got the chance to turn my life around
But where's the inspiration when the hardest shit is dying out?
I'll never tone it down
Like teachers bitching in the smokers lounge
My reefer piff is in the open now
Me and DJ Gone smoking big blocks of hash
R.I.P. Jay Dee we're greeting you with common slang
