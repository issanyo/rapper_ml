[Hook]
I'mma tell you all, don’t fall in love
Just do what you do, and love yourself
I'mma tell you all, don't fall in love
Just do what you do, and love yourself

[Verse]
Have you ever fell in love so hard that you couldn’t get up?
Jumped out the window, glass shards, on the yard, feelin' so slumped
These days I've been trapped in my mind, stuck in a high
A reason why she left me, no wait, what am I sayin'?
Comin' down from a trip, a mind boggling journey
Life's never easy, wishin' that I live perfectly at peace
But these days niggas just focus on the cheese
I don't gotta front nigga, that’s still me, that’s still me
It's still me, sittin’ home alone, trapped in my brain
With some sunflowers, rainbows, butterflies and bees
If I rapped about my feelings, some will say, “It's fuckin' lame”
Who's to say:
“You got it? You think that you got it?
Something? You think you’ll be something?
Nigga just stop it, just stop it. What you gonna do if don't reach your dreams and goals?”
And this what I'mma say, I'mma say:
“I'mma just float, free as a bird
Have no worries about your words
I'mma just float, like that ice cream with that soda
When I reach my dreams and my goals
Nigga I'mma say, “I told you so” yeah I told you so
Yeah I'm killin every mothafucka with this flow
Yeah I told you so, yeah I told you so
‘Cause I know I'm the realist nigga out here in the eight-six-oh.”

[Hook]
I'mma tell you all, don't fall in love
Just do what you do, and love yourself
I'mma tell you all, don't fall in love
Just do what you do, and love yourself
