I got the logic of a misanthropic pessimist
I tell like it is
No regrets being neglected
For a second, I lost it all
I needed that phone call
Now fuck off
I got the billy batson, since you ask
Making classics with pathological menaces
You find me menacing
Yet I'm legendary
I’m different
I beg to differ on your opinion
Write til I'm dizzy, shit
I said I'm loving this predicament
I said I’m loving my influences
Doing shit, setting the pace
Primetime like Mr. Phife back in the day
This a loosie
Play this if you want to remember, should you lose me
I gotta go head
To better mindsets
For a better conscience
So this shit could make sense
Life made me sick of it all
I stay pressed
And I got no pussy to relieve the stress
Going to neck and neck for a check
No reprieve cuz I gotta live with my regret
Many times I wish our paths didn't intersect
I had to slow this shit down so you won't forget
