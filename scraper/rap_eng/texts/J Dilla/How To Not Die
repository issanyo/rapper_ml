[Verses: Lwansta]

I took a drive at night, no fucking learners or a license
My mom gave me the keys because I haven't told a lie since
The day I said that I don't give a fuck about my exes
But no one gives a fuck who your ex is, it's who your next is, unless you're Drake
And if you're not then man you're fucking fake
Cause all it takes for you to be great, is have an honest face
And if you take advice from a plastic nigga who doesn't have it nigga
You probably gon' end up with that habit nigga

I'm very distracted, I'm very distracted
Pardon my lack of commitment for giving a fuck, but I'm young and I'm a born free
During my come-up niggas ignored me
Now every fucker wanting a feature cannot afford me
Believe me niggas, this rap shit, it isn't easy niggas
When the bass drops, I'm topping all of you cheesy niggas
Had it fucking easy? I hope you fall on your fucking ass and motherfucking crash and never pick up a fucking pad

I'm bitter, I hate rappers getting what I want
Whoever picks these rappers is never picking the right one
And I'm just fucking tired of niggas who should retire right after they drop their first fucking single cause I'm the right one
But anyway I won't hate, cause hate's gay, it's fucking ignorant like that nigga that hates gays
If I can figure out how these niggas just make way for niggas who they say are sicker than 8 aids I'm in
With only one A I got in, now I'm a first year student trying hard not to sin
I took my shit up from a town very easy to get around
Now I'm in a city where it's so easy to get a round
And niggas don't make a sound, stay plotting under the ground
The only time they hold you down is when making sure that you drown
But they'll never get their hands on a nigga, they try'na throw me in the fire but they'll never take the fans from a nigga

You ever been to Kokstad? You prolly haven't
So shut the fuck up, cause you don't know how hard I had
Tryna kick the habit, of rapping while I was trying to study
And having all these whack gigs and never making no money, damn!
I'm just a kid, who's mother always supported
Never heard a single rap cause knew she'd be disappointed
I was present right at church but my rapping not anointed
So this talent was a blessing but cursing just makes it pointless

Took a drive at night, no fucking learners or a license
My mom gave me the keys no, I took the keys, with her permission though
Forgetting the fact that I never listen though
She told me "no" to girls, but she caught me, but weren't kissing though
At least I like girls and I'm not gay, but I'm bumping Beyonce
Sometimes I shed a tear but I'm not gay
Man I just can't control my emotions and fucking emotional coaster
When I'm angry I'm pissed, when happy I'm like a kid

Sometimes I just can't resist
And shove a dick inside of the fucking bitch of  life that I'm just trying to live
And I'm just so depressed in this fucking res
And all this stress and just need to rest but I don't, I'm tryna beat the rest
But being the best is not what I'm looking for
Man I just wanna make living doing all of the shit that they booked me for
Motherfuck what they looking for, motherfuck what they took me....
