[Verse 1: ESAI]

Yeah! Yeah! ..

Yo , this tone of expression
Is aimin' at your soul
I just came out the liquor store
Coz where I'm from you're
Not allowed to smoke weed
So we buy guns
And drink mo liquor, nigga!
The doctor's give you drugs
And get cash in return
In my sleep I twist and turn
Coz the media lies
Tryna make us look like
Animals and savages
But that's the plan of the man
Behind the media madness
Ethiopia got cursed
Kemet gave birth to evil gods
Now we're dealin' with cops
And later I'd be dealin' with pops
I'm the intelligence, the creative force
Behind my experience existed
Before there was a need
To measure time, ESAI divine
I took time with every line
Jus' to see how far a nigga can rhyme
Hide me like the black substance
Fuck the priest class
I reflect the universe, dark matter Melanin
Lack of knowledge got my niggas back paddlin'
I've been asleep for three days
Now watch me rise like the sun
OSHUN, I spit an ocean
To wash away your mixed emotions
47 lightyears aways from my destination
Elegant intelligence
ESAI watchin' you like the eye of providence
Am I gon' fade into irrelevance?
Coz this shit won't be televised
But if it does, then real music is being recognized

Third eye open like the eye of Odin .. x3

[Outro: ESAI]

Dawg, it's been a long time
You already know what it's like ..
We're out here , we're out here (bang! bang!)
O125 shit (ESAI) Finna elevate
Finna ascend like the number 8 .. x3
(A nigga still moppin' for a livin'
Should I ever stop dreaming?)

Bang .. x3 Yeah!
