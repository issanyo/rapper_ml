[Hook: Donnie Trumpet]
Maaaaaaaan, I got struggles
St-St-St-Struggles
I mean struggles, I mean struggles
I mean struggles, I mean struggles
I mean struggles, I mean I step in all the puddles

[Verse 1: Donnie Trumpet]
I mean I'm never right
Never have the right rebuttles
Always left me deep in the muddle
Most people are honory
I'm ordinary, if anything I'm subtle
She wanna get close, but only cuddle
Full beard, no stubble
Bust my shit jumping through obstacles
I need a stunt double, maybe a couple
Considering how often we get it rockin'
Considering this life is tick-tockin'
Too quick, it'll make you twitch and pinch
The one sitting next to you on the train
Like, "hey, to be or should we not?"
Life is digital, metaphysical, moving pictur-al
Hardly easy enough to be broken down like minerals
My whole style is biblical
But below the brows of the infected youth is eyes
Is I, I mean me
The infected youth is we
Hailed from sea to shining sea to shining me
It's only ever K.T.D
And walk me from Western Grand
We got time to write
Time to recite rhymes
Kick rocks, little pebble
Kick rocks, little pebble
I haven't got time
Kick rocks, little pebble
I haven't got time
Kick rocks, little pebble
Grab bricks, little devil
Coming up to "R." "P.' with no "I" in between
Struggles
Shake jams like, grabbing hands with Doomer
Smooth operator like [?]
He's a gooner
She's a goner
Only says what she's goin' through
Teasing make her feel pretty
So she gets ready every night to perform

[Hook: Donnie Trumpet]
Maaaaaaaan, I got struggles
St-St-St-Struggles
I mean struggles, I mean struggles
I mean struggles, I mean struggles
I mean struggles, I mean I step in all the puddles

[Bridge: Donnie Trumpet]
Go in Malcolm
Go in Mellie
What's up

[Verse 2: Coldhard]
Okay, you're going to have to say when we go live
Alright, you know it's hard being a man
You taking life in your own hands
Gotta make it in this cruel land
Never will I understand why
People say this shit so different
[?]
I've lived my life on the street, and
If that's pathetic you better sweat it
Straight to the streets with the guillotine to get beheaded because
A man, gotta have a plan
While sinking in the sand you better understand
I'm serious
Nobody is helping us
Don't you think it's rough enough
Times have come and fucked it up
Nigga can't make no goddamn niggas support [?]
Those motherfuckers try to do you in and leave your [?] with him
That's like the thugs
It really bothers me to death
How we gon' make it with no commonwealth?
Without a man's [?] women are another species
Pause the L-I-V-E
Thinking everybody deserve me
So, I'll just carry on
[?]
I'll take the stand
I'm a struggling man

[Refrain: Donnie Trumpet]
I'm a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
All I got is my hand
Doin' the best that I can
I'm a struggling man
I'm a struggling man
All I got is my hand
Doing the best that I can
I'm a struggling man
