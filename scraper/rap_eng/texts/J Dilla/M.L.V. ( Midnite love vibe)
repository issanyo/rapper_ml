[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Uhh, girl
Let's start it off like this
I got your favorites
The wine and the Papaya
So, don't be surprise if u find a love letter
With my name posted as your secret admirer
I can't lied to ya
I desire ya, when you speak it's like an aria
That's why I honor ya
Even tho it seem like we're from different worlds
Bottom line is I wouldn't want a different girl
Got my heart in a whirl, mind in a twirl
When it unfurls, its like a world of Disney
Its magical
You  told me sex was your favorite passover
So, i made like a cassanova all those midnite's
You asked me over
Got a switch that change like winds in October
That's what I told ya
That's when you came ova
Kiss me on my shoulder, onto neck then , onto my lips and
I never felt anything like this
A night of straight bliss
That's why  I love u girl
Because if I didn't say it rite now
I'll be remissed

[Hook]
She had that midnite love vibe
Sex 9 to 5
The heat i just can't describe
She had that midnite love vibe, she had that midnite love vibe

[Verse2]
And she had to be a winner
Cause everytime i turn around there's a candlelit dinner
And in my universe, your my center
Shit, i rather be with you
Then my crew, crack a few brew
"Horton hears a who" to monogamy
And honestly that would be my song to me
You killing me softly
I be assisting to you my angel like Bosley
Not claiming falsely, but truly
For you i do my duty, not to do it foolishly or cluelessly
Because that would be rude of me
I will love you prudently
You don't know what you do to me
Even tho this is new to me
My love goes out to you..
Exclusively, secluvisely, conclusively
I'll remind how it use to be
When it was just you and me
So girl, can i take a bite from your apple that's forbidden
I'll take whatever giving
Tell me what's your favorite sexual position
I bet i hit just right,  the way that u like
I make sure it be a blockbuster night...

[Hook]
She had that midnight love vibe
Sex 9 to 5
The heat I  just can't describe
She had midnight love vibe, she had that midnight love vibe
