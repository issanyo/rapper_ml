[Verse 1]
Yo, I remember days when niggas ain't fuck with me
Dropped that mixtape, that was the first time they noticed me
Mama always told me be the fuck who supposed to be and never claim the streets
Cause you will trying to reach a peak
So I rep that Westside, no place that I'd rather be
Where niggas stick they chest out until you pull out that heat
Hoes got they breasts out, blame it on summer heat
On the corner tricking cause the kids ain't got shit to eat
Only God can judge me in her head is what she repeat
Shit, get it how you life shawty, college don't come cheap
They laying everybody off, it's hard to make ends meet
Unemployment tripping, rent due in about a week
Told her oldest song "you too old to be rhymin' beats"
Told her youngest son "we too poor to waste time on dreams, so get up off your ass, find you a j-o-b"
While his step-dad on the couch and he sound asleep
Never just a soul, nobody different than you and me
Behind closed doors ain't no tellin' what niggas see

[Pre-Hook]
I do this for you and me, drop classics on classic beats
Just trying to spread love and peace, but I'm strapped cause they packin' heat shit

[Hook (X2)]
That's just how it goes
My nigga that shit crazy
Trying to provide for myself and my lady
Man I remember days when they said I wouldn't make it bruh
That's just how it goes
My nigga shit get crazy
Trying to provide for myself and my lady
Man I remember days when they said I wouldn't make it bruh

[Verse 2]
I remember days, she wouldn't get close to me
A hundred plays was the first time she noticed me
She said "I like your rhymes and how you approached to me"
Don't talk about smoking weed, I like that shit so to speak
Appreciate the love, didn't notice you noticed me
Just trying to hold it down be the best that I'd every be
So claimed to be my friends, they ain't know me before the beat
Back when I just the lil' nigga across the street, they tried to take my shoes
They ain't taking my shit from me
Ran straight home from school, grab that 2' don't fuck with me
Pops wasn't around my older brother, this shit for me
Like teach me how to box a nigga up if he fuck with me
So my mama moved across that way cause she heard that we don't get along with half the niggas from up the street
Load the Jeaps and U-Hauls and off that we go to see
A fresh start played a part in how I own the beat
Take a seat, let the top drop down so I can every last obstacle that God left ahead of me

[Pre-Hook]
I do this for you and me, drop classics on classic beats
Just trying to spread love and peace, but I'm strapped cause packin' heat shit

[Hook (X2)]
That's just how it goes
My nigga that shit crazy
Trying to provide for myself and my lady
Man I remember days when they said I wouldn't make it
That's just how it goes
My nigga shit get crazy
Trying to provide for myself and my lady
Man I remember days when they said I wouldn't make it
