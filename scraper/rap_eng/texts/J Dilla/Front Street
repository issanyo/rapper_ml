[Intro]
Yo
This is dedicated to all the fake suckas at home
Watching them videos they ain’t going outside trying to portray this stuff
You know what I’m saying
You living on front street

[Hook 2x]
Gotta get away find a place to stay
Cos brothers they be killing on front street

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
Now everyday I turn around, I see fellas on my block
Telling more stories talking bout killing cops
Bragging on they guns just for fun
Pour fire the title they been know as the daily murder one
They rolling [?] and packing automatic weapons
But each and every one of them is know for half stepping
Johns all talk, Willy Thomas is a talk
And the twins Ray and Jay both of them are mummas boys
And niggas, the same niggas that are trying to play me
Like a little sucka, he even disobey me
Da nigga Phat Kat, pay those chumps that never rhyme
Cos the rest of my life, won't be spent doing jail time
And all i wanna be is looking at me hard, trynna be like Dr Dre or Snoop Doggy Dog
Check it
All i wanna be is looking at me hard, trynna be like Dr Dre or Snoop Doggy Dog
Ripping out the tape light, thinking its reality
Bragging on the next mans dope game salary
When will I go, when will I retreat, and get the hell away from this front street
I gotta go

[Hook 4x]
Gotta get away find a place to stay
Cos brothers they be killing on front street

[Verse2: Phat Kat]
Yo
With saturday I'm cooling at the mall with my lady
Just because I'm making dollars, niggas wanna disobey me
And play me
Like I was a no name punk
When this saw me walking down, so overheard em talking junk
Reggie thinks he tough so the other suckas follow
But they all fake, drinking water out a vodka bottle
So I just laugh, and went about my way
Cos I wasn't gonna let the little punk spoil my day, hey
Why do brothers fake and front like they tough
When they with their crew, but when they by themselves you call their bluff
I ain't got time for these silly chump games
Its a shame, niggas fronting hard to get a name
So I just push along and mind my own
Im pissed off, thats why I took it out in this long song
So now I think I’ll just retreat
And get the hell away from this front street
So now I think I’ll just retreat
And get the hell away from this front street
I gotta go

[Hook 4x]
Gotta get away find a place to stay
Cos brothers they be killing on front street
