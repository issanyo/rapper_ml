On the brink of extinction as the last of a dying breed
I'm thinking of connecting to the planet via LinkedIn
As my inkwell empties on the paper to complete the siege
I set forth prior to the time I climbed up pinewood trees
Dot "I"s and cross "T's"
Lost sleep over daunting small tasks that are beat
Before my pre-conventional level was formed I was free
Now I know the risk of towing shit but do it as I please
My theories postulate impossible camaraderies
That brotherhoods can be formed regardless of who populates
I operate in dark closed places like a shadow
I'm your darker half behind you, and regardless it will follow
Got you open from the spoken word
A world apart from what is yours
Tell me what we're running for? To not end up on cutting boards?
Thoughts old as Dumbledore. Don't act like it's been done before
You worried wort wept then got you swept like the crumbs to floors
Prepare, now here comes the force
