[Chorus][x2]

I rather not live in regrets
But knew I tried my best
And went up against these vets
But in the end all I want is success

[Verse One]

Mom and pops don't want me rapping
They don't want it to happen like negus gun clapping
Word up, that's a fact man
It had me deadass bent, cause Nas told me to represent
Don't want my life feeling incarcerated
Being away from hip-hop, that shit will have me mad hot
Why work from eight to four
When brothas and ladies be diggin' my flow
It's a miracle how I became such a lyrical genius
Ghezz, it's in my genes, so lemme emulate with words that penetrate
My mind-states invincible, don't be despicable
You can't stop me at this rate like a freight train
I'm trynna live that American Dream, get that quick Benjamin green
Become a hip-hop musician, let's make it a living
That's the tough decision, I don't like the position
It's something I gotta do and let loose

[Chorus]

I rather not live in regrets
But knew I tried my best
And went up against these vets
But in the end all I want is success

[Verse Two]

Not gonna front, was buggin' cause I failed math
No career path, skipped class, and felt dead last
I got the knowledge, moms enforcing me to go to college
I'm not dedicated, but I keep my mind elevated
Concentrated to be the greatest, then reminisce
I gotta stay true to myself and not get caught up in the wealth
Rapper turn to actors wanting cars, clothes and hoes
Corrupting the minds of the youth, they blinded with blind-folds
Don't wanna lose myself and be like the rest
Drop out the contest, I'm trusting my conscience
Went unconscious, hit my dome off the concrete
Death I faced and defeat, that's how I know it's destine to be
This God given talent I'mma use it, not abuse it
Most rappers have it, then they lose it
And I'mma be good as long as I got music
So this is what I'm choosing

[Chorus]

I rather not live in regrets
But knew I tried my best
And went up against these vets
But in the end all I want is success

[Verse Three]

To seek success you gotta be the best
Therefore you beat the best
And when you need the rest just take a minute, then defeat the rest
On a quest from rags to riches
But I'll come across some crazy bitches
And some negus witness I'm getting my weight up
So, you can't knock the hustle, these skills double
Your in trouble when I throw my verbal assaults
My rhymes stay loaded twenty-four seven
Spitting straight venom, don't test him with these silly questions
Cause the intellect of a young black male excels quite well

[Chorus]
