[Verse 1: Danny Average]

Witness bullets past you
Like it's in 3-D
Death and Destruction for the Damned
Like it's 3-D
Suffer inner casualties
Cause kids cannot casually witness

An Asian
Thinking he gonna do some Asian shit
Occasional flips, racism's got me flippin'
Cause to the white folks, I'm the Yellow man sinnin'
And the Black Kids pinnin' me, thinking that they winnin'

A climb to the top that is futile
Few make past the Green Mile
My story's akin to that of 8 Mile
Trying to tell my story in the time span
Of 8 tracks

Offer my effort
They say 'ef it
For the 'ef of it
Effortlessly throw it out
Without hearing a sentence

Forget this
Like I forgot God
Going back to Church
No matter how bad its gonna hurt

Cause it's hard
For Guilty Men
To go back to their turf
So what the fuck is repentance
If I'm not even sure

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Danny Average]

You know I'm glad I'm rapping
But you know the face is stern
I don't wanna deal
With your ideals
I wanna be heard

No matter how cliche
That shit can go and really be
It's the truth
And that's the rule of thumb that governs me

A confused child
Finding his soul, with a Pathfinder
Crashing it down like it's some Fine China

At school, they call me fuckin' "Fine China"
I hope I shine on
While they work at diners

My flow's compared to that of dinosaurs
Dynamite motive that'll coach me to truly soar
Don't look for roses
If you can't see the bottom thorns
As humans, we have the white halos and the double horns

Guilty of the Guillotine
Deserving double swords

I try to stay humble
While I wait amongst hunger
In desert summer
All I can say now is
"Wow, what a bummer"

"FL since '03"
Yeah
