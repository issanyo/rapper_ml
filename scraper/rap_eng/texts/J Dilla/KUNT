I got more watts then Reggie

Get at me, at least leave messages so I can press breastesses
I'll seeberg your jean like Breathless did
Attention Deficit Disorder, New World Order
They overplay my mixtape and you know you really oughta'- OH!


My profile disclose my Italian nose, uh
We could play horse with my stallion flows
Chrome Palladian dome- all I saw before I OD'd
Take an antibiotic and ima' call you dopey
Where I prefer Snow White, blow type, do you copy?
Maybe if I spell it O-U-T, like B-I-G
I like to just busta like you better believe

I got it down to a science you brain can't accommodate
Tricked you out, like that snake in the tree
I handle forbidden fruit, the apples of Eve
And I take a big bite, Jobs comma Steve
