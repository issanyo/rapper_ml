Champ of the ring
Dead president face paint
All black with
A bat like Sting
Cause its no games
When I flow man
These Hollywood Hogans
Are program for the grand slam
They want a batter
Not a broken ladder
Stars in my gang
Has mass appeal
So it really don't matter
Who's up first
Let it be me
I swear I'm the worst
My attitude is perverse
Life's a pool of sin
& i dove head first
My life's a book
Every chapter is a verse
Down to earth
Like a pair of converse
When I converse
So knod ya head
When you hear Kon verse
Bad vibes disperse
On a Fwego. beat is where you heard it first
So now Im back up on my bullshit
When i was smoking on Big L's
Waking up to a Full Clip
My niggas gon feel this
I suffered so I can return
Harder & smarter
Dropping bombs like pearl harbor
& sharper with more cuts
Than your barber...shit
Save the best for last
Your future is my past
Now I'm tryna master my craft (Kraft)
& if that sound cheesy then
There's nothing like this Ruff Draft
Take it back , take it back
When we wore wave caps
On Fl studio demo
So we couldn't save that
Wait let me rephrase that
We did beats all in one shot
Not alot of time on the clock
But we made that one shot
When I shared my room
With the rats & roaches
I struggled than
So who knows what else I'll be approaching
We all players in this Slum village
& never need coaching
Rappers living in a glass house
& its stones they throwing
Always boasting bout clothing
Rapper or model ?
Are you flowing or posing?
& if the shoe fits then
Fuck lets go bowling
Cause the pen's/pins
Can't fuck with me when I get the ball rolling
