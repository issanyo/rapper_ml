These particular raps are not quite as dense as some of them...

[Verse:]
These particular raps
Are written to point
At the zero pointed
Divine vessel who's being that's anointed
And crowned
As the kings and creators in the crowd
Maybe being up later makes him sound
The way he sound
So much coffee has already been downed
Take my clothes off
And unshoe to straight ground
Can't keep runnin' away like a dog to the pound
He's almond by the mound
Ain't nothin' but a hound
Ry-Dawg gonna reminiscence about
When he first heard this Dilla track sound

A young lad reading Farside comic strips
When my sis played the Pharcyde sound
Labcabincalifornia
Come join Mr. Blockhead now
At the dinnertable
Just to inform ya

The new is aesop's
Let the Float just soar in ya
Make your head swell
And your ear's drum ringing
Keep the neck broke
And cut out Ryne's singing
Yeah Ryne's fucking singing
Most yap about sticking about their thing in to the laments
To the lamens
Sex needs to be refined
Fix your limp noodle like Ramen
He reduces numbers faster than Rainman
But keeps in the sane, man

The Vatican raping babies in a sense
Innocent is taken
As they make their sacrifice to Satan
Still talkin about the Pope
Got to hit the hay at 6AM cuz Ryney couldn't cope
About to crash out
This bloke
Coffee is coming up
Coming out my throat
Making my ass runny as a fucking moat
With the drawbridge up
That is wet as mother fuck!

Shout out to Madvillian, MF DOOM, Madlib
Most definitely Yasiin Bey
Centaurian Christ Anitheies Jackson
Man who is packin
Your ascension
As his number one mission
Shout out to Jay Electronica and J Dilla
And accordions and harmonicas
And the million he making
The shit is so taken
Every thing he flows on has already been made then
Shout out to Maven
You know I had to end it with Rynestone
Get down!
More sacred than limestone

I will just silence my self now

And let the Cowboy, Rynestone
Feel your now boy
Where you at man?

For christmas I wanted to make a mixtape
So I did real ass hip hop- fake ass white boy
Some say he tight though
But thats just Ryne though
Talking about himself
Probably post some shit on your facebook shelf
Yeah give me some good health
Yeah let me spit his wealth
In abundance
Sick of all the rules and the pundits...

(Sometimes they were comedic
...
Or relentlessly horrible)
