[Intro]
I had to rip the beat from YouTube

So...

[Verse]
It's quiet; like, not even a mouse
Mad thoughts; tryin' to even 'em out
Red Bull; I'm up from drinking an ounce
Times 20; I'm tired, but sleepin' is out...
Of the question
Which is what?
Exactly
So I rest in
This nest of habitual inception
Putting ideas in my head just to mess with myself

Landed in limbo with a death wish
So I off'd myself and got a fresh fit
But I'm haunted by a false projection of my soulmate cause she never wanted to exit
There's your pop culture reference
Guess you need that sorta' thing to accept this
Or at least respect this
Message
Nowadays, you're either "lame" or "epic"

And here I am, in between, while you scream that I need to hurry up and pick a direction
Well, check this
Me being fly, means I'll end up nuts, having tea with Ms. Nesbitt
And you'll just say I was nuts for thinking I could
Or absolutely wack for thinking I would
When you're the ones giving me buzz
Story of the world's toy
Killin' me cause you believe that I can be replaced
Well, surprise; I'm one of a kind
They're dumb in design
So, when you're having fun with a guy
Playin' him, thinking he has a buzz that's mine?
You gotta be kidding me, he's a con
He can't last infinity and beyond...

He can't last infinity and beyond
