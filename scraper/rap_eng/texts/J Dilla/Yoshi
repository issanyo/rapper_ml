Think less live more
Negativity you learn how to ignore
My mom told me a smile is always free
& our style is COOL don't you agree
We stay fresh with the beats & the lyrics
Rebirth of the slick spirits
The kush had me moving timid
Dre said without limits
So now I grind every minute
Still on a mission
To mention everything that they didn't
So i bring the peace like John Lennon
An angel dress all white linen
Let my hair grow back
With the nappy heads bringing the afro's back
Yall fruit of loops
Get yall apples jack
If it ain't kushandbeatz
Then i don't wanna hear all that

"go slip on a banana peel
Hittin turns like mario kart for the thrill
Just to see how it feel"

Its just me & yoshi
In this jungle
Where they all wanna score
But they fumble
Over money clothes & jewelery
That they see
But i see family's
Kicking each other down
For gifts just to be
The star on top of the tree
It's sad you see
Not enough to be controlling me
Or holding me
I think , therefore i am
Black peter pan
Bring philosophy to this tragedy
Go head laugh at me
My imagination equals my greatness
Peace & love to the nation
Taking naps while you waking
Time waits for me
I don't keep track of the day
I be lost in the week
Sp don't ask me what i think
If you're gonna against what i bring
Tryna change my mike
To white & i don't even sing R.I.P
Go head mighty mouse
Go head chase the cheese
Ima moonwalk to dreams
Changing everything
