[Intro]

Yeah, ugh Turn Me Up Some

[Verse 1: Kris Prince]
Ha Ha Ha, check out this bizarre, rapping style done by me
Its Kris Prince, I put that key, you put yo key in
Wisdom we be seeking, Pray that we don't die in these streets
Now hit the beat shit!
I'm not a hitta
But if I was man I'll prolly be a killer
My thoughts are deep, my verses sick & you should panic
I spit a flood that's wetter than a tsunami
More epic than Michael Jordan
It's Gone Until Further Notice
2011 I met a girl Ayana
Her ass was fat her switch was nice & she could sing
She sang a song more epic than Whitney Houston
I hit it like Ike & Tina wait, fuck it


[Hook: Kris Prince]
I hope I find a way, I know its just all a phase
I pray that, that never change, okay, okay
Peep my flow, I think I need to killem with that Redman Flow
Niggas talking shit like I really give AF
You gone make me have to killem with that flow
Jeans sag low, I think I need to killem with Redman Flow
Red flannel vest, with the skull caps on you gone make me have to killem with that Redman Flow, Redman

[Verse 2: Kris Prince]
If you don't know about the name you better Google
Got  plans of getting money writing hits with this music
& fuck the baddest bitches in the game before you knew em
You screaming Carpe Diem, Im screaming Karma sutrum
Im Driving 88, rockie fresh into the future
Then roll a King L while im smoking on that hookah
This is just a message for you posers who be posing
You not about that Bang, Bang, you a straight lame, Kay Kay
Do this shit like eryday, got the Juice like Chance say
Im going deaf, Ion need that he say she say
The Game is not for me
My girl say Im too weak
But when I was in that pussy she was screaming like she was
2 weeks: away from labor
Do me a favor, you minimum wager
Dont quitchor day job
Cuz me I got a blowjob while mingling with your daughter
She breaking down a quarter
I'm dedicated I dont need no hype
I roll a blunt and smoke a thing called life, I hit it twice
I'm dedicated I dont need no hype
I light the blunt and smoke a thing called life, I hit it twice
Chi City see the way I impact, you woulda thought that
Michael Jordan was back
You never thought that it be me on the track, you woulda thought that
Michael Jordan was back.....Kris!!!
