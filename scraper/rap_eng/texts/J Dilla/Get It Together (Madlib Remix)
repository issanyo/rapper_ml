[Verse 2: T3]
Start your funeral boy, write you obituo-
You shouldn't let you know who back in the studio
The flow that'll chew your whole ass like a tootsie roll
No laugh no jokes
And my loot is still usual for those who provoke
Get mush like a two-year old
Pushed in a corner 'cause you under control
Can't hold the fast-paced 'cause your pace too slow
'Sho nuff slow poke wichya face exposed
Put yo ass in the sling and do what you suppos-
And oh, here's a couple words I think you should

[Verse 3: Baatin]
Together for what?
The S is makin' them [?]
Runnin' my mouth, sometimes i wonder for what
It just goes to show how many clits you blow for what
Just to get a number?
That's why my crew will never ever sit back and have to wonder, about another paycheck
My lyrics are definitely considered to be a threat
Like steppin' to the s would some shit you regret
