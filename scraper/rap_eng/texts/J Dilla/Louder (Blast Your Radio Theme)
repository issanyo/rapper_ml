[Verse I]
Hey, hey yo, here we go
It's Madlib I'm alive through your stereo
Yo, it's the imperial
Wear my Jim hat cuz I don't want to catch no venereal (whoa)
Like stomping at the [?]
Get yo paper then holla at yo boy (Hey Dilla)
This beats like doodoo on a stick
We hit you hard like voodoo on a vic
Clap ya hands now or clap your tech (heh, what)
You can bet your last dolla on your impala
Imma be the nigga walking out popping my collar
Praise Allah cuz y'all blessed no stress, armored
Take all y'all

[Chorus]
All the ladies (a little louder)
All my niggas (a little louder)
All the ladies now (a little louder)
All my niggas (a little louder)
All the ladies go (a little louder)
All my niggas go (a little louder)

[Verse II}
It's like jumping in outer space
I smoke the weed some my niggas fuck with powder bake
We getting raw cuz we're looking for louder bass
You gumbo niggas gone leave with chowder face
How we do (ba-boomboom-clack-ba-boom)
Luxurious like Cadillacs
Banging through your ears till your cataract
Till your hip bones cuz we're trying to get badder stacks
Put our hands together for some badder cats
Stomp the bass drums then we add the claps
Now we're going past the red, turn it up to the max
Play it in your car, at home, or in your racks

[Chorus]
All the ladies go (a little louder)
And all my niggas go (a little louder)
All the ladies say (a little louder)
And all my niggas go (a little louder)
And all the ladies say (a little louder)
And all my niggas go (a little louder)
And all the ladies say (a little louder)
How we do it
