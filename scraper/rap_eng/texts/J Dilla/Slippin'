[Hook]
Yeah, what is it you want me to do?
You was wondering, I'm wondering, too
I won 100 and the love of the crew
Ok, now what is it you want me to do?
You think I'm slipping in some pussy, don't you?
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
Yeah, you think I'm slipping in some pussy
You think I'm slipping in some pussy

[Verse 1: Early Mac]
Wheels up, I'm in another mission
I stay in and out of countries like I'm facing extradition
That there is tradition, I pay for it, though
You know I don't wanna be that far away from it, girl
But you know I gotta go, it's money over there
And you know you wanna bring again money over here, huh?
Don't play dumb, just say something
Or better up muscle up and pay something
Light bill, phone bill and the rent checks
Spent a lot of dough but I haven't got my respect
So respect my wishes, please call your sister and have her get your ass
And it's funny what a nigga gotta do for cash
Or to make it last, it's all the same, lame-o
And don't be sad cause you lost me, you hush it in the return, Frankie Rossi, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, what is it you want me to do?
You was wondering, I'm wondering, too
I won 100 and the love of the crew
Ok, now what is it you want me to do?
You think I'm slipping in some pussy, don't you?
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
Yeah, you think I'm slipping in some pussy
You think I'm slipping in some pussy

[Verse 2: Illa J]
I changed my verse, I didn't spit it
I let her fuck with my energy so I couldn't deliver with the same feeling
Now I'm drowning in the river that was created from this pain spilling
Got a strange feeling and some change coming
A new deal, man, every day with my main woman be blowing
Every day with the same questions I get the same answers
They say we be going in circles, it's all the same
Well, we must be cause it ain't nothing changed, trust me
But you can't and you won't, please don't say you will cause you can't, don't be fake Please go pay your bills, take your ass to the bank
Handle your business, get a life, get away
I don't care what you think, about to smoke and have a drink'girl, you know I'm the shit
I'm legit and these other dudes kind of fake, opposite, I'm on my rock star shit

[Hook]
Yeah, what is it you want me to do?
You was wondering, I'm wondering, too
I won 100 and the love of the crew
Ok, now what is it you want me to do?
You think I'm slipping in some pussy, don't you?
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
Yeah, you think I'm slipping in some pussy
You think I'm slipping in some pussy

[Verse 3: Illa J]
I'm not having the same convo no more
Don't wanna hear you complain no more, oh, no
I'd rather be in the gang dolo, solo
You pushed too far away when we were so close
Another couple of weeks I was gonna propose
A year later in our honeymoon taking off your clothes
But you didn't make it cause you couldn't keep your mouth closed
I can't even handle biz without you sticking in your nose
Last time I seen you it was quicker than before
Chemistry was missing, I felt that when we was kissing
Over wasn't working, we could end up in the kitchen
Stomach wasn't growling, wasn't the same hunger

[Hook]
Yeah, what is it you want me to do?
You was wondering, I'm wondering, too
I won 100 and the love of the crew
Ok, now what is it you want me to do?
You think I'm slipping in some pussy, don't you?
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
You think I'm slipping in a pussy
Yeah, you think I'm slipping in some pussy
You think I'm slipping in some pussy
