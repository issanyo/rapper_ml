Son A yo, I'm back in this bitch
With the tenacity to carry me til gravity splits
My tracks splint shins. I'm happiest when scattered a mist
The ex straight edge stepping up his weight and strength since
The play pen break out birthed an apex kid
A good way to get your cranium kicked
I exhibit how to cope with those anxiety fits
Unexplainable, but trying hard to find it
Balance is the key that I administer through talent on the fly
Watching paint dry holds about the same exact equivalence
As listening to this. Skies shimmer off it's brilliance
Resilience is what conveys my goal to any harmers
Here's a warning shot, followed by a piercing through your armor
It was long before the dawning I was beefing like the stroganoff
So I wrote it off and walked about the garden
Talking bout the future and with no regard to stardom
Never tarnished. Moving through the atmosphere
Only upward from now and for a thousand years
