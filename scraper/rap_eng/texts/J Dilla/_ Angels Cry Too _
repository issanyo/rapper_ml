Angels Cry Too

They say Tre drop the album I said let’s do it
I had to stop myself to realize I was bout to lose it
The music was timeless I couldn’t sacrifice the movements
I had to grow like a seed water was self improvement
Lately all I see is fear and tattle tales the good shall prevail
I know ya’ll niggas read it in brail but
If you was blind, I guarantee you could feel this shits real
Through the belly of the beast, I’m in-debted deep in these streets
XXL nominated me back in 2016
The westcoast savior had held it down with these 16’s
Didn’t water down my art, I had to survive the flood
I built my own Noah’s ark and kept it real from my heart
D.lx it’s time for me just to embark my stretches
They mistake me for being quiet as being a let down
But the game needs a future OG in the making
Never mistaking to someone whose lacking confidence faking
I’m the prophet knowledge you pop oxycotton you trynna fit in with the wrong crowd
Nigga this ain’t high school  this is real life all I spit are these haikus
I wanna be the illest artist in this generation
But my patience lacking virtue and straight retaliation
Momma hit my cell she said the cities burnin down
Another nigga shot by police man I heard his body hit the ground
Ain’t nobody just saying shit I don’t hear a fucking sound
Man these niggas ain’t did it in my city like I ever seen
Often times I do reflect about the person I’ve become
I will live on through this music if they kill me on with a gun
So I’m never backing down go tell the block go tell the judge
We ain’t scared to lose our lives so fear is not a damn concern
Gotta stop killing all my people this a bridge I gotta burn
I’m a 1/1 don’t need no funds to fuck all of you niggas up
Look into the sun don’t see no one your values aren’t like us
The contingency had came to me with wisdom niggas scum
This is elevated rap from losing out we’d overcome
Use your fucking brain my nigga this is life not a test
Pulled the sword out the stone I’m the Hero in the flesh
I'm the Hero from the West
