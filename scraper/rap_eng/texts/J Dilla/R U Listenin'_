[Intro: Illa J]
Uh, uh, uh, listenin'
Uh, yo, are you listenin'? ("Are you listening?")
It's Yancey Boys, are you listening?
Uh, it's Cake Boys, are you listening? ("Are you listening?")
You know, Jay Dee, are you listening?
You know, J. Rocc, are you listening? ("Are you listening?")
Guilty Simpson, are you listening?
Yo... ("Are you listening?")

[Verse 1: Illa J]
It's time for vacation, styles outdated
'Bout to send these hatin' hyenas on hiatus
Blazin' these indicas, hybrids, and sativas
You check the cleavage of these rocks, way harder than her tits
They're just as fake as her lips, as long as they pay her attention
My raps is straight third-dimension IMAX
Niggas heard but didn't listen, your girl is my witness
She came in the living room while I was puffing my brains out
And she start sucking me down while I watched my favorite sitcom
Why are people so slow witted?
Uh, are you people listening? You see how I'm flippin' this?
What color is that? it's called originality
Cali weed, it gotta be grown naturally
For me to grind it and roll it, now I can't control it
Backstage smoking with MJ and Otis
A naked lady on the couch, does anybody notice?

[Chorus: Illa J]
I said, my people, are you listening?
Show some love to the 313, you know me ("Are you listening?)
I said, my ladies, are you listening?
Show some love to the D, baby, you know me
("Are you listening?")
Uh, yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, I shake them haters like dice
Yeah...

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
GS, boy, uh-huh
I chief cheeba, and sleep with divas
And serve these wack rappers like pizzerias
You get sliced on the mic, I'm so nice
Amazing shit's here is about as common as cold ice
And you could date your woman your whole life
She still gon' leave with GS, me, yes
Ain't no secret, he blessed, he fresh
All y'all green and depressed, and we West
On the coast with a blunt to burn
Sometimes I lose count of the funds we earn
Yeah, who wanna retract than count stacks?
I'm happily surprised where the amount's at
Rap is my kingdom, give me the crown hat
My crew deep, we blow reef' and down 'gnac
And Illa J is my co-defendant (What up, fam?)
We had it locked before we spoke a sentence, yeah

[Chorus: Illa J]
I said, my people, are you listening?
Show some love to the 313, you know me ("Are you listening?")
I said, my ladies, are you listening?
Show some love to the D, baby, you know me ("Are you listening?")
Uh, yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, I shake them haters like dice
Yeah...

[Verse 3: Illa J]
Got you in hypnosis, I'm a Detroit hypnotist, tremble quake
Quivers, shiver you whole inside with this unexplainable delivery
Deliver these vocals that you picture so vividly
Comparable to those memories
In the early stages, before society put your minds in cages
So you could block, stays in your mind
A wise soul, Illa drops the gems, you smell that winner seas
Part the game like CP3 from Tennessee to New Orleans
("Are your eardrums open...?")

[Chorus: Illa J]
I said, my people, are you listening?
Show some love to the 313, you know me ("Are you listening?")
I said, my ladies, are you listening?
Show some love to the D, baby, you know me ("Are you listening?")
Uh, yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, we shake these haters like dice
Yeah, I shake them haters like dice
Yeah...

[J. Rocc scratching]
