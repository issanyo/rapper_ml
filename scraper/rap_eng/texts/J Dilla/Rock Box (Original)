[Intro]
Rock box non-stop
Non-stop Rock box (x4)

[Verse: Que D]
I’m a motivator, dominator MC
When I grip the microphone I’m turning out whole cities
Que D representing the blee
On the microphone me
I’m standing on my lonely, MC
Are getting cold crushed when I bust
You getting left in the dust
It’s a must
Suckers think they claiming the name
By using profane
Well let me show you how to gain
I’m dropping it right
Fox dope shit…
That them niggas can’t see
Homeboy you can’t even stand next to me
Fool…
Let me tell ya I ain’t got nothing to prove or lose
I’m leaving whole crews singing the blues
Tell me what’s the news it’s Que D, me
Turning out Motown, throw down
And I’m serving em say what?
Most niggas ain’t got the guts to bring in
Cause the stage is terminated when I leave it
I know ya can’t believe it
Every since ’87 I knew I would achieve it

[Hook]
Rock box non-stop
Non-stop Rock box (x4)

So let me ride the rhythm
Dope rhymes is what I give em, eh yo
Back in the day I used to wear a Kangol
With a hellified flow
My lavish abundance is constant like the rain
Hitting your window pane
Ya already know my name
So ya hear the cosmic rain
Inhale it… while them niggas in the crowd yell it…
Rock box… non-stop
Bet I pop ya knot
And you know it’s the sure shot
Cuz brothers losing they nuggets
Ya had to ask what is this?
Cuz when I aim I do not miss…
The beat.. I’mma get in it
Like them skins when I hit it can’t you dig it
Dug it.  Rugged.  Dope…
Emcees can’t cope
Ya ask if you could touch the mic when I’m done…
Nope
I’m slicker than slick
And I don’t mess with tricks
Cause tricks is bad for your health
When you ain’t hot knowledge of self
I ain’t got time to get caught up
I’m steady making cheese
Please I don’t want around when we
Say what’s up… to my nigga Jay Dee, T3
And my brother Batin doing the Errol Flynn
