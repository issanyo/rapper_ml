[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
Diet plant based roaming in Savannah landscapes
Secret handshakes we syphon ya fanbase
Plan dates to inundate your airwaves all day
Lurk in every corner like that roach in the hallway
Tribal sacrilegious ceremonies we got machetes
But'll put the double barrel to you homie
Can't teach this my DNA kid I bleed this
Genius dropped part one and made em fiend this
Brothers trying to sound deep talk about Egypt
I tell em take a trip there before they start speaking
Abidjan don style is Burkina Faso murder y'all slow
While I'm swerving thru Lagos
God knows I'm nice large bowls of rice
It's a gold mine we rock keep large goals in sight

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
I’m futuristic I rap in a Delorian
Bums I’m cum ladi slum valedictorian
When I bless I get press like peterians
I hit em with the African heat sub-Saharian
Get C-notes in my section we call it a caesarian
The force of a galloping horse no Sagittarius
Clandestine guided by my ancestors
Shark tank spark an idea get mad investors
Cameroonian Liberian anthem
Whole team shady like Nigerian bankers
Used to have anger issues now I let the slang hit you
When the music has you traveling lands then its official
I’m a survivor came a long way from the bottom
And now I got it sip colladas in Addis Ababa
Modern day Garvey Marcus logic
The richest continent coming together we marching
This for my people
