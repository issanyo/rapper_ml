Alright so, this is what happens when you write at 3 in the morning and you're tired as fuck

I'm floating on a cirrus
Mirrors reflecting off of the sky and I can see us
In perfect harmony, Cupid worked his archery
Aimed for the heart and he done bulls-eyed his target
Enough with the malarkey, sick of women acting snarky
Accept the way I am, I'm not changing for your parties
I am hardly the party-type, I'm rather mellow
I don't want to see teens grind to Black and Yellow
I prefer be at home with my words and my dome
Or at the lake practicing the curving of stones
I can never get them to jump
They always sink to the depths with the rest of them chumps
I'm a venomous monk, still killing them with kindness
Perform good deeds, leaving villainous reminders
I'm feeling like a giant and this innocence inside us
Is amplifying the lessons that the syllabus denied us
Writers write us, do-what-is-righters
I'm riding round writing rights until I get arthritis
My minus sinuses'll take time to turn back to positive
So I'll be digging down dirt till I discover China
Why the "kinda sorta"? Believing in my doubts
Easing up the route for the season in the South
Degrees be hitting thousands, I'm not even counting
Cool over hot, but the sun's giving counseling
Wonder, one of a kind, you're like no other
Still winning these 1-Ups when I'm playing GameBoy Color
Picking smart, Linkin Park, listening, I'm feeling number
Than a plumber ghetto-stomping Koopas and Gumbas
Or Goombas, caroomba, carumba, hit me on my Tumblr
Only posted, once, once, when I was sitting under
The weather, it all comes together
Forever endeavor until never becomes an ever
And it's clever when you think about it, yeah, all the things you doubted
Or believed, achieved a piece of experience out it
Loudest, inside but not the surface
Express yourself, don't live life without a purpose
These serpents always try to bite you like it's Slytherin
My Gryffindor sword is sworn is slay hypocrites
And it is just crazy, met you just lately
Give me them digits and missus, I'll call you maybe
I'm not the type to play the field, but for real
Seems like all a girl wants nowadays is to chill
With one dude one day and another dude the next
They party all night and have booze and sex
There is no rest, every year they get trashier
I praise the old-school chicks who stay classier
I'm way happier when I'm "tied down"
Cus I know the ropes, give a princess my crown
Now it's coming back like a boomerang
What goes around comes around like they used to say
Shouts to Dumile for keeping my rules in place
And to the haters for failing to keep my mood enraged
Cue the stage, aim the spotlight and center it
Yeah, I spit the truth, but they not like the evidence
Pac-type message sent: we all get depressed
But if there's room for some betterment, the story hasn't ended yet
