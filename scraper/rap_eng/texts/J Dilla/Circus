[Verse 1]

My niggas say I don't have a remote chance
With romancing you, they say I can't but I don't even listen
I'm smitten and I wanna be the man you hug and kissing
I think I'm in love, I'm not kidding, I'm missing
Your cute face. You got me in a daze
I wanna be stuck in a maze with you for 8 days
I try to find a way to say that you take the air from my lungs, I'm dumb and numb when I see you
Lately I've been contemplating whether I should ask or not
You get asked a lot but decline cause guys have hurt you in the past
I want you fast like a race car finishing first and not last
Them other guys wack
Hope you know my feelings through these lyrics
And these flows are the ones that I hope you cherish
I'll even show you I'm scary
I ain't even gonna lie though, I'd even marry

[Hook]

Surplus thoughts of you in my brain
It's like people in a circus, and I wanna tell you but I'm nervous
Maybe baby it's worth it
I think this is the right wording
(x2)


[Verse 2]

Can you be mine already?
I'll be by your side when your tears shedding
Your the Betty to my White
And steady being the Bonnie to my Clyde
This ain't no bluff, I'm ready to cuff
You're the woman I desire
I bet you that's shocking like wire but I tried to tell you but I just got quiet
You are my lighter to my fire
I know I sound really cheesy
But getting you and me together isn't easy
You knock the breath out of me, got me wheezing
I'm needy for you love like a homeless man, will you feed me?
Hope you know my feelings through these lyrics
And these flows are the ones that I hope you cherish
I'll even show you I'm scary
I ain't even gonna lie though, I'd even marry

[Hook]

Surplus thoughts of you in my brain
It's like people in a circus, and I wanna tell you but I'm nervous
Maybe baby it's worth it
I think this is the right wording
