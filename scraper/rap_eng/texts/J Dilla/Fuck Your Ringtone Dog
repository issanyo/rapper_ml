[Verse 1]
All this shit about titties just isn't enough
I need to speak on something witty, or some shit with some substance
I sit at home thinking 'bout how I would run things
But when it comes to rapping I just wanna give up
I'm frustrated as fuck, I wanna make 'em go nuts
I wanna say something silly, when I say it they bug
Then rewinding back A Million ain't even enough
They need to listen while they pissing or they eating they lunch
I've been eating a bunch, I've been eating at brunch
Four Seasons with a Stephen telling me that I'm done
Cause I drink to much, and I smoke too much
And only wrote one song in the last twelve months
I'm like, "What? You that shit ain't true."
Then I use an excuse about my planets aren't aligned with my moon
I just need a little time to rectify my mood
Honestly it's the vibes from the side of the room
Well, it's kind of the truth
I try to be loose, let it ride when I slide in the booth
But it's all bullshit, they only need one song
That their boss calls a hit, cause the kids sing along (Tell me what you want)
So I'm with Q-Tip at the Vevo launch sayin' "This is some shit, where did we go wrong?"
Fuck your ringtone dog, put it on vibrate
I was fine till your phone played Black Eyed Peas (I got a feelin')
I was high off my in-store best by date
I was fired from Best Buy 2-thou-8
What's that say about me? I was sellin' CDs
Now I'm sellin' CDs, I'm a stellar emcee
I've developed a freak type fetish with a beat
History rewriting whenever I speak
Wherever I be, I'm there with my team
HBTV, Brain Bang, Hypebeast
And we still down with sorority games
Now a days it just seems my priorities changed
Life's more to me man, more important than fame
I can't afford being 40 and just pouring a drink
Talking 'bout how I would've been, or should've been big
Now I'm on the front porch and I'm smoking a cig
Talking to a girl around the age of 18
Like I was your age, I was living the dream
I had seven girlfriends with Brazilian butts
And a house, and a whip, and a million bucks
But now I'm a drunk, dumb looking for fun
How I wish I didn't love college so much (I love college)
Now I wish I would've put knowledge above
Everything else except God, shit, and love
So good thing I realized this before
I'm a poor 24 with a date in court
For my third divorce and my child support
That's remained unpaid since I went on tour
Now I'm sure all I need in this world is free
Except tickets to the Knicks and an eighth of weed
