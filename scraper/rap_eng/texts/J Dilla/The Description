On the intro, I got Issues
Why does music hit you, never let me hit tho
So wet as I hear her breathe
I got needs she got knees
Put my instrumentals into mental's
Im coming, Mindless, as I do my thing Im ******
But she ain't feeling me she spineless
No backbone I want that back bone
As Im On Microphones, We chilling really feeing, you
Tell you all of my issues, don't really care
Not the true truth metaphors to clear the air
And Im here, true Time not solar time
Tilted like the seasons, reason for my reasons
#SubmarineOperations, You wet and Im patient
Got me fixing myself in the mirror, self reflection
I ain't stressing, She got me feeling myself ******
I figured that I mastered waiting, Mass concentration
Flooded, I need ejaculation
Drowning in my own sorrows, no pause tho, its my creation
Sound wired, Im not lyin, she burning, Im still yearning
Dreams of touching, I lust it now I love it
