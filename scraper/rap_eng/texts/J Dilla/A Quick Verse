(Hook)[Cyrus]
Yo, yeah, like.. what is the look of?
Its got something to do with um, being the man
And handling your biz
What's love got to do with it? Ask me?
Its all bullshit

Yeah, you know what love is (x4)

(Verse 1) [Cyrus]

I know deep down in my soul we can make it work
I said deep down in my soul I wanna make it work
But I know there's certain things I gotta change first
Because this pain in my heart feels like a vein burst

Its like this love at first sight is just a strange curse
And everyone in my sight is just a paid purse
Tryna bring love into my life, just to make it worse
And everytime it feels right, they say that it hurts

Its a shame its like I've been chained since my birth
Called my heart to this gravesite & it came in a hearse
This love life, I thought I'd stay away from it first
But really its the only way I'll remain on this earth, peace (peace)

(Hook) [Cyrus]

Yeah, you know what love is (x4)

(Verse) [ATG]
Uh, what is the look of?
Its got something to do with um, being the man
And handling your biz
What's love got to do with it? Ask me?
Its all bullshit

Yo, you know what love is (x2)

Here we go, you know what love is

You know what love is, but I know what it isn't
Refusing to listen, without having a pot to piss in
Feeling distant, but when she gone she the one you missin'
Always dissin', but you can see the way her eyes glisten

When you kissin', a new day is christened
Treatin' her right, living your life like a good Christian
If she your everythang, she second to nothing
That's wrecking something, just instead just give her thanks with your stuffing

Her loving's the main thang, so you gotta maintain
Was down before you gained fame, sucking your main vein
We know this ain't fulfulling, so we gotta make a choice
Get our feelings spillin', treat the rest as white noise

Be the right boy? Nah fuck it, just be a man
Take her so high that she never Neverland, Peter Pan
Cuz she your Tinkerbell, always got your fucking back
You gotta work for love, trust there ain't no luck in that

Uh, you know what love is (x4)
