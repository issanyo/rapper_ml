[Verse 1 -Ace Cartar]
I think im losin it, I got to spit some ruthless shit a booth let me spit my truth in this building
Fuck what you think i gotta be heard i broke from the herd mentality thats running this earth
I just wanna live comfortably enjoy a couple luxuries
Be living on my own but have my love ones still in touch with me
I dont trust a soul fuck these niggas and these hoes
Cause if it wasn't for these flows aot of people wouldn't fuck with me
You feel this? This is me right here
No bitches and no braggin and no weed right here
My futures riding on my talent i dont want to be a screw up
Tryna be the shit because we coming out the sewer see thats Queens
Jamaica, where you find ace the cartar smokin papers
Converting my pain to vapors, Getting on my grind
By getting stress up out my mind, I hear the beat i stretch a rhyme
And then you know its a rap
Beautifully coded in the coldest flow in ages
Have you trapped in a maze of amazement no room to breath like iron maidens
For those who hating
Feel the hunger pains coming from a motherfucker stressin in the basement
Thankful for what i got i always strive to be more
Go to school supply the block or block some niggas in ball
Oh shit, he keep the flow slick
Man who the fuck is this claiming hes the dopest
Nigga in queens, with the mean style, written or a freestyle, Nigga
Nigga this is just lightwork im testin a couple bars as if im tryna see if the mic work
Spittin till my motherfuckin pipe burst, Lines talk a second to decipher
Kill em when Im steppin into cyphers
And they was waiting for that #Comebackkiiid

[Hook - Ace Cartar]
You see these flows are my only place to go when my house dont feel like home and im losin all my hope
You can eiter support me or take me as a joke but if you smiling in my face then suck my dick until you choke

[Chorus - Ace Cartar]
Im sending out a fuck you to all of those who hate on me
Fuck you to all the bitches who sold me false dreams
Fuk you to all the people out here listening
Hating on a brother cause he decided to make a change

[Verse 2]
My Minds open  nigga my minds open, open up my eyes to the world
I was blind folded like pin the tail
Except if you miss you're either dead or in a cell
Rise from this abyss dont dream of heaven and wake in hell
You gotta make a hange you see a dollar rules the world but it can't get you everything
So i gotta keep a balance, keep my balance in check
Like the supreme court and congress do the president now
Fore'I continue lemme just say fuck the police, all they ever did
Was take people i love from me, It started with my mother
Then it appened to my homies, father was always working
No one to talk to when i got lonely, I would roll trees
Play a beat and spit some poetry, Nobody likes me except when im performing
Used to bump 50 to myself all the time the first rap song i heard was your lifes on the line
Came into rap humble, I dont give a fuck now, serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Not a pretty but my moms think m handsome
Telling me to find myself a girl to give a grandson

-Hook
-Chorus
