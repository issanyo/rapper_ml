[Hook:]
Get money that's all I think about
Go and get mine, fill up my bank account
I know that life much deeper than my pockets but I got to fill 'em up 'til the whole world cop it like uh (x2)

[Verse 1:]
You probably never met one chiller but if you step to the kid I might swing like Dilla
Mr. Skinny Blonde Guy
Radio killer, pocket filler
I'ma get it man
And to B. Young is what they all check
Y'all can't rap like me
Took it back to my roots, watering my money tree, yeah
Time on my side, man I'm only 23
No Jordans, more than ordinary
Remember when I couldn't afford them [?]
Now I got to cop a ho and ride that bitch with bare feet
If a boy couldn't even afford to be carefree
Write pieces in my basement before I could even afford [?]
Fuck what y'all say, life much deeper than my pockets
But I got to fill them up til the whole world cop it
Til the whole world cop it, til the whole world cop it
Man I got to fill 'em up til the whole world cop it like uh

Whole world, whole world
Let the beat ride
Whole world, whole world
Let the beat ride
Whole world, whole world
Let the beat ride
Whole world, whole world, whole world
Let the beat ride
Let the beat ride
Let the beat ride
Whole world, whole world
Let the beat ride
Whole world, whole world

Until the whole world cop it like
Whole world cop it like
Until the whole world cop it like uh
