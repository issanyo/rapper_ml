[Verse #1: AyJay]
I'm gonna kick a freestyle off the top of the dome
By myself but I got Invaderz so i'm far from alone
I kick a rap to beats to get away from problems at home
I'm not that much of a nice guy, I got a heart made of stone
And trust me, i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
I know i'm better off just going to school but instead
I skip classes and days, just to burn ashes away
I miss the times with my friends when we'd just be laughing away
But no, it's all gone, just because of my dumb choices
I walk in a room and just hear the sound of some hushed voices
And people starin' at me, my mind is gone but where exactly?
Do I even need to be in life to make my parents happy? (Right)
My life's going nowhere, going through an existential crisis
People sell their souls but have yet to catch the devil's mind tricks
Gonna get off now just to let you know my life sucks
Be careful making friends cause you gotta choose the right ones
