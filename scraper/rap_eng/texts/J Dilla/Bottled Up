CAN'T EVER GET ENOUGH OF THE SUN- NUMBER 1 THING I MISS ABOUT IT
THO I DOUBT IT'S ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEGUN
WITHOUT it BEING TAKEN FROM ME. LET IT COME
TO ME IN A METAPHOR, IN A COINCIDENCE. THROUGH THE DOOR-
GOT ME LISTENING TO MORE THAN JUST WORDS. LESSONS BEING HEARD
& THE KARMA THAT YOU DONT BELIEVE IN- YOU GON FEEL IT CREEP IN
& IT'S GONNA BE ALARMING. ALL DEFENSES WILL BE WORTHLESS, YOU AINT CHARMING
CHARRED THEE CHIPS & THE CARDS BE DISCARDED.
IT'S SUNDAY, NOW IM SEEING SATURDAY'S LOST,RETARDEDDDDD
(chorus)
Something stays inside of me even when I say I let it out
Swallow it back down my mouth
Theres nothing gold thats satisfying me
I got the potential essentials, come curious & gentle

(now)
I HARDLY CAN RECOGNIZE THIS BITCH IM LOOKING AT
EVERY MONTH SHE CHANGES WHAT IS CARRIED IN HER PLASTIC SACKS
IN FACT, SHE ROTATES PUPIL WIDTH & BODY WEIGHT
CAPTIVATE, CRUSH (CALIFORNIA STATE)!
EMBRACE THE WASTE THAT WE CREATE & HATE
THE DAYS THAT CREATED THE WAYS THAT WE COULDN'T EVER ESCAPE
I'D RATHER RELATE TO KILLERS THAN LAMES. NOT STUCK IN THIS GAME
BUT ANTICIPATE THE MOMENT THAT WAITS TO HAPPEN LIKE RAYS
OF SUNLIGHT HIDDEN IN SEATTLE HAZE
IS THERE ONLY ONE SHINING ? CUZ I CANNOT PASS THIS PHASE
THE AGE, THE PAGE, SOMETHING ABOUT IT DONT LAY CORRECTLY IN MY NOVEL
VOCABULARY? BITCH DRINK IT OUT THE FUCKEN BOTTLE!
FULL THROTTLE WHEN I MODEL MY SKILOS & MY MOTTOS
YOU THINK YOUR RAPS & MINE, ARE LIKE TOMATO & TOMATOHH?
NO. BITCH, THAT SHIT HAS GOTTA GO
YOU & RAPPING IS LIKE FLOWERS IN THE SNOW TRYNA GROW
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN GNOMES-
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT. & I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
(chorus)
Something stays inside of me even when I say I let it out
Swallow it back down my mouth
Theres nothing gold thats satisfying me
I got the potential essentials, come curious & gentle

PARALYZING PAGES, TAKING NOTES AS I GO
REWIND? FUCK THE THOUGHT OF GOING BACK IN TIME
I'm TESTIFYING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLAND
& THEY SENTENCED ME TO CLOUD 9. DOUBT IT IF I FOUND TIME
TO BE ME, TO BE ANYTHING THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE:
BEAUTIFUL, DRAMA-FREE !
WANNA BE CARELESS. WANNA WALK WITH A WHIP
& LASH OUT AT THE LOSERS, REVERY ABUSERS
PICKERS & THE CHOOSERS, EVERYONE WHO CHEWED HER
FUCKEN HEAD OFF. STRUCK EM, HEAD NODS
NOW THEY SAY IM VIOLENT
I'm A LOVER NOT A FIGHTER, BUT I LOVE TO FIGHT, AINT NO DENYING IT!
TRYING IT, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY. WE BLACK CATS, GOT BLACK VEINS & ANAMOSITY
I'm A PRODIGY, BITCH, I'm A PROPHET, I'm A LEGEND
I'm EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO BE, & WHO SAID IT
Now regret it. & bet it, has everything to do with dianetics
Accidents, & trafficking, now time to set it..
Time to set it off.. it's about that time to set it off...
