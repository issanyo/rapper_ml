Born and raised in a cloud of doubt
Moon showers in the night over rooftops
Curse upon the heavens

Momma wakes up hung over from a life
Full of dead promises and a bed full of hooligans

He took me to his crib last night
Poured a cup of wine
Half empty like the night we spent

Filled me up like a cork of course
Went a few rounds
Gang war filled up with magnums

2am and the nights still young
Wore the boy out like a heel on a concrete dream
This isn't what it seems

This one here's for each borough gypsy
Taking the train canteen filled up with whiskey
This one here's for each borough gypsy
Journey through life bedrooms are bullet proof
