[INTRO: DOMiER]
Man
This for all them fucking ladies who on they SLY COOPER shit
Think they all fuckin sneaky snakin
And Fuckin bakin n shit
Fuckin Doin niggas dirty behind they backs
Fuck that!

[VERSE 1: DOMiÃ‰R]
Some old routine wake up and I bake up
My lady Mary Jane she lookin good wit no make up
First in the morning, early bird gets to hit it
My lady's one to flake so I guess I didn't hit it
Got fed up so the breaks I had to hit
Stopped on a dime cause I caught me a dime
Cop me a nine then the copy my style
This shit is so smooth maybe that's why I spread it
Now we got the west less stress now we fresh n
In case u didn't know my name is Domier the manager
Reckless drug handler
Sticky shit in my canister
Always on the Pharcyde when she started passin her always passin up
Rejectin every session with the blunt I that was passin her
No more chances
Ima just assist cause there's no need for a misses mistress, I'm hittin in the cut like a blister
If u think i am then then there's No way I miss her
Twistin all my limbs
Playin twister in my timbs
Creasin all the suede sayin peace to all the days
We used to kick back chill relax roll a J
But now you roll away and I'm stuck in disarray
No more sunny days and I feel a different way..
I said no more sunny days, no more sunny days, and I feel a different way

Where my haze at?
Shit i needa pack that shit on everything man
Cause this bitch got me stressin
She sweatin nigga..

[VERSE 2]
Never shines, that wasn't my intentions
They say that true love has no reason to pretentious
Pretendin something I would do to protect us
I still feel you energy runnin thru plexus
Mystery, misery the thought of you is killin me
But my affections was trapped inside body kit
Brushed it off my shoulder stayed flexin like a gym
But my soul charchol blacks like the grim
Reaper
I wanted us to grow like the reefer
I could do it right this time if you teacher
Third eye was blind I'm a pineal student
I remember I was there everyday never truant
But when I check her records there was two in it
So watch your back cause ur lady could be doin it
Two different people, I don't fuck with the sequels
I was always OG
Original to people
She stole my whole soul got a hammer and she smashed it
I didn't even know every week she was smashing
I was with her every single weekend and we was smashing
I guess that's the reason when she left she was dashin
Skurrrrrtin in V
Skirts be on the streets
What the fuck jus happened?
What the fuck I see?
My lady in a Benz when I'm whippin in the jeep
My lady in a Benz when I'm whippin in the jeep

[Outro]
In the jeep, in the jeep
I was smokin weed and I came across my lady
With another man
Got a muthafckin hand on him
And I smacked him
With my fuckin pack
Cause with the weed, I don't give two shits
Fucka
Lil sum sum sum
I'm out fuck all these bitches
Fuck these hoes
Gz up to the fuckin feet up
