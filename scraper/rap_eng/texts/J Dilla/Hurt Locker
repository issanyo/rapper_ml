[Verse 1: Cons3pt]
Walking on water the rivers shallow
Spending Life tryna escape a shadow
People dreaming they tougher than teflon
Yet I seen a pawn transform to a galvatron
Shattered dreams, only left as a thesis
Don’t cut yourself tryna pick up the pieces
Cause people is leaching
After they be preaching
Only cause they tryna find a rhyme to this reason
People who look down on me knowing it’s vice versa
Wit a verse unrehearsed, tryna allign ursa
Don’t box me out i’m on a rocky road, no apollo g’s
Sentimental heat, sun beating on his enemies
I’m tryna put my pictures in a higher frame
Im tryna have a legend speaking my name
My own friends say beats don’t bang and wouldn’t mingle
But if Drake rapped on this beat i’d be a next hit single

[Hook] x3
Blowing up for the music
But the sheep gon' defuse quick

[Verse 2: Tahji]
Bringing the boombap back, faster than cooked crack
Right off the bat, since it’s not trap, others might say its wack
But this is that great sex when you reach the apex without the latex
Competition stay vexed against me an Cons3pt
They bite the bullet, better off grabbin’ the 4’5’ an pullin it
I spit the real get mass appeal, they all mad at the kid
Can’t match the skill I mastered it, now guess who the master is
My job allows me to be the best I can be
Top 5 dead or alive, they mark us like Camby
The villainous spit an ether, they take over the industry
My enemies wanna see me fail they tryna shoot down my dreams
You must hold some large testicles of you wanna test these goals
Now hazeus, on that cross
An they still wanna test me so, I hit em with this deadly flow
But you already know
My own friends say beats don’t bang and wouldn't mingle
But if Drake rapped on this beat it’d be a next hit single

[Verse 3: Cons3pt]
Yea yea single single
I’m not just tryna make a freaking loose change jingle
But honestly the honesty they just couldn’t handle
Cause the lies keeping them above the rest to dismantle
Do you have the power to let power go?
Powerless as they devour the art filled with hours (Yo)
An the talent they wouldn’t pick their apostrophe
I’m not just tryna add more prophet to my prophecy

[Hook] x4
