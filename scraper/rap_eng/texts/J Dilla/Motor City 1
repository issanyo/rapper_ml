[Instrumental]

[Samples]
You always talking about getting down, you can't even get up
Think you forgot who I am

Dilla, Dilla, beats, beats
Dilla, Dilla, beats, beats
Beats, beats

You might think it's funny
But the bitch better bring my money
You might think it's funny
But the bitch better bring my money
Can't even get up
Think you forgot who I am

Dilla, Dilla, beats, beats
Dilla, Dilla, beats, beats
Beats, beats

You might think it's funny
But the bitch better bring my money
You might think it's funny
But the bitch better bring my money
