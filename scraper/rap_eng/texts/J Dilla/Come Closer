[Verse 1]
Get close to that underground feel
That 94' dusty sound, I got them all ducking down still
This that 'doesn't really-come-around' skill
So I might cool with you, and pull the bucket out; chill
On the real, don't question "Who do it the best?"
Since grade school in the desk, all my music in depth
Mentally and physically, Confuscious in the head
The lyrics hit them like the shooter left two in your chest
Emergency surgery when you versus me
Grab currency in this limited eternity
Currently, not in it for the cash and sum
So later reimburse my debt to the maximum
Legacy of the greats and longevity in the game
But for now, these sentences is setting me in my place
Expect to be top 5 when they bury me in the grave
And if I'm not already, I better be in your favs, nigga
This sounds like the magnum opus
Cause I'm balanced like the space, sky, land, and ocean
Ultramagnetic MC, electrostatic voltage
This is such a classic moment
Frozen in time, '99, open your mind
Got the potentest rhymes, and they hoping it's fine
Immortalize me when this shit is finally done and over
But for now, they keep on coming closer

[Hook]
Time for the truth, get live with the crew
Come closer, come closer
Wisdom for the youth, let me kick it in the booth
Come closer, come closer
We thieves in the night from a beacon of light
Come closer, come closer
If the scenery is right, I'll leave and it on the mic and
Come closer, come closer

[Verse 2]
Sound like I been digging in the crates
Or channeling the spirit of Biggie in the grave
Nigga wait, I been feeling so vintage '98
This for my killers and a hundred dollars billers getting paid
Cut the check, got no buzz and yet
Exude sheer confidence like a dozen vets
I better be your top 1, taking nothing less
And that never change, shit is just common sense
I'm like Cassius Clay way back in the day
Remember back when hip-hop required passion and faith?
Bet you don't, let them know I'm not rapping in vain
My lyrics hit them in they soul from a maximum range
In hindsight, the limelight steals your private life
So should I really rhyme tight right beside the mic?
Everything to me is just Beats, Rhymes, and Life
And when the sunshine my punchlines are shining bright
Like a diamond, in that army jacket lining
My flows make them think that they back in '96
Cause it's written, and my tracks are timeless
But the critics won't stop until they have him boxed in
Like he not West Coast, ain't got the best flow
Block him off the blogs just to let the rest know
No, another false move, and I'll be at your neck, throat
Better not get close when I let go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Product of Badu, and Com too
Black Thought, and Big L, lyrical monsoon
Big Poppa too, little Pac, and DOOM
Some Lauryn Hill, and Daddy Kane for my momma dukes
This is not for you, strictly for my Rastafari's
I'm like Marcus Garvey and Bob Marley
Top shotta, a me not a batty boy
Better hit the deck when my bombs deploy
A dem so rude, my flows too old school
I'm like Nasir back in '02
One of the last real niggas alive
R.I.P. Guru, I been gifted to rhyme
Feeling instrumental in the brain
Come closer, come closer
But won't stop 'til I'm a legend in the game
Come closer, come closer

[Outro]
Time for the truth, get live with the crew
Wisdom for the youth, let me kick it in the booth
We thieves in the night from a beacon of light
If the scenery is right, I'll leave it on the mic
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
