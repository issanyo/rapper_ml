I’m texting one, chatting one
Left a message for another, got number, done
Home alone and flowin in boxer briefs and smoking
This is the life I wanted (I guess) not chosen
Broken in a way that the glue makes me more human
Less stiff, less rigid next thing let’s hit it
Let’s drink it, let’s stick it in cause I won’t get carpel tunnel
Poison’s smoother in a funnel
But it’s no more medicine than a leach to the eye
Freak till I die, meet my disguise, it is I
Shoot Socrates in a murder suicide
Learn to eat a burger if you heard, yer eyes lied
And you look how I feel big reveal feel faint
Smack a turkey with a face and you break Walt's plate
That bit was true now sounds fake
What the what is a memory ....great
I geek out and feel proud but knee deep down
This creep's frown makes the deep feed fish drown
We all swim in circles and the tank is too small
Pull the stopper out the bottom, love the loss of them all
