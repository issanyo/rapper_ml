[Intro]
No love

[Verse 1]
I'm 19, gotta give me a nine
Cause I live among this city with crime
I mean the grittiest kind
On the block, gotta get on my grind
I stand on cop cars screaming the city is mine
See my mama in the living room on her knees praying
Guess he in the sky, shit God ain't here
Bless for me, please don't say that son
I don't want to lose you, you don't want to lose me
You don't need that gun
Mama please let my arm go
If I don't carry this I don't see tomorrow
Please save all that for another night
That church shit couldn't save my brother life
These other boys out here carrying they automatics
They throwing out the shot gun like quarterbacks
See I'm tired of the lows, so I'm getting high
What's the point of life when we all finna' die
Please tell me what I'm supposed to do
What you trying to tell me, I should vote for who?
Is Obama gone bring my brother back?
Ask God will he bring my cousin back
See ya'll can make the laws without me
Ain't no secret service standing all around me
On your news cast talking all about me, like you really all about me
No love

[Hook]
See I don't dream and I don't cry
No love
Can't you hear the soundtrack
Bring me along, bring me along

[Verse 2]
Walking down the block with my armor
Watch this karma, blood on my Jordans
Watchers recording, the old folks calling po-po, they never came
Reporters saying reporter, tell me who was here to blame?
I put it on the internet, world star homicide
This is my pain that you finna' idealize
Making sure the world know my brother name
They see his killer face and they see me do the same
I seen him on a Saturday, met him in the alley way
Ain't no where to run now it's time to retaliate
Blood everywhere got us looking like anime
Go and tell his mama that his son ain't finna' graduate
They say we living lost in disaster
In all your judgement I never heard answers
Tell me go to school, well I ain't in the mood
Living by my own rules with my gun on the dashboard

[Outro]
Yeah
See I don't dream and I don't cry
No love
Can't you hear the soundtrack
Bring me along, bring me along
