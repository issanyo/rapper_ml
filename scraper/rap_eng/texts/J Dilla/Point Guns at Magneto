[Verse 1 - Noveliss]
Stay clear of Noveliss on the purge
Bottomless notepads you can't fathom my body of work
I'm handling words, I demand I damage a verse, Stop him
I demand I butcher these lines with a knife or like I forgot them
The verbal predator, spreading the message letter by letter
To level competitors, Crash Nebula, Timmy Turner the veteran, Wishing for world peace, They lack benevolence
Mostly hoodies and sweats I came to represent
There can only be one, and can't anyone hold me
Discussing my travels among second hand smoke from my homies
You couldn't follow my tracks regardless of how you peddling
Get buried by the Kazekage for meddling In rebelling against the Elohim
I'm Gaara on Tatooine, using The Force, forging sandstorms
And put, every emcee in front of me in a half-leg Boston Crab like Lance Storm
You can't fathom my brainstorm, they call me Voldemort I hold the fort
Kidnap emcees my notebook smelling like chloroform
You misinformed, I feel like Jason Bourne
This shit is boring when it's, second nature to snap arms on every rap song
I last long in every aspect just blast off, when tunes play
I'm Doomsday minus the grey skin, and it's doomsday to your stereo
In any scenario do the, Doomsday Device a little better than Hawk and Animal
Blast raps intellectual, Gambit, shuffle the cards I was dealt and throw them at a Sentinel
It's robots on the pedestal
It's pointless to point guns at Magneto, they made of metal fool...

(Hook)
(x4) It's pointless to point guns at Magneto they made of metal fool
