[Verse 1: Android]
This a joint for the explorers
The ones dying of boredom, the ones with minds distorted
They tell us push forward, but when the weights on our backs, crush our spines, we stay cold, stuck in time
I got way too many lifelines
Cuz when my world starts to burn, I guess I really won't be in my right mind
And I can feel the heat creeping in the night time
My dreams range from love to sniffing white lines
Drugs haven't even stepped in my picture
So many years stand before me, so which door do I enter?
I treat my ballads like scripture, best believe I'm a sinner
I've been hanging onto life ever since I was thinner
But now, I flicked on the lightswitch, I opened up my soul
You think we different, but I swear we share a common goal
It's satisfaction, our lone plan of action
I'm trying to paint a portrait, just without the use of captions
Do I care too much, or, do you not care enough
I'm asking while I try not to erupt
Or internally combust, answer, that's a must
Kick back, light a dutch, just don't fade into the dust, on me
Cuz its a cold world, don't let your thoughts turn into whirlwinds, mine are  already swirls
A preacher this young, I swear I'm being honest
But I'm not speaking at churches, I'm more into teaching logic
If one meets me, one would likely be astonished
Hidden genius, with a label built through gossip
I was 14, fear feasted on my brain
Kept my head down low, got acquainted with the rain
Put Satan on my shoulder, saved God for the pain
All these fake eyes staring, almost made me go insane
But, I'm tryna see from a different view
The next track coming through, let it be my cue

[Verse 2: Android]
Coming back with the honey flow
Viscous, slick spit, sick kid with the runny nose
Hey ain't it funny bro, cuz my flow is from the beehive
And still I get no respect from these guys
I divide, the rhythms and I add in all the sweet lines
Subtract the whackness, multiply the benign
I'm just tryna see my, purpose on this earth
Questions everyday, been confused since birth, but
I can see the light through the dirt, and
I believe everyone has worth, and
I told myself, I gotta show my hurt
Through these words that I speak cuz I'm leaning off the edge
No promises, I'm not sticking to a pledge
But my word is bond, you use yours like a wedge
Man, I won't say it again
Got the honey on deck, flowing until the end

[Verse 3: Android]
It's too thick for you, its too thick
My heart stays small, grow large in booth trips, this art, my music, as sharp as toothpicks
Got a young face, but a old way of thinking
R.I.P J dilla, hope you think my flow is sticking
Got a couple pieces missing, but this picture looking vivid
This is all real, y'all feel, like I'm always kidding
But why would I lie, there ain't no room in the sky
For a bum like me, to spread his wings and fly
Im just speaking my mind, which always weakens my pride
It's that honey, really I don't mean to be funny
It's that honey, wait until I start making money
Sick of feeling so crumby, sick of being a mummy
Walking around like I'm dead, my dream just never got fuzzy
How he flow like this? On 2 beats by dilla
A thick 3 minutes, don't get that much realer
It's cuz I know my role, cuz I play my game
Cuz I shoot for the stars, the only place to aim
Man that boy is the truth, yeah I feel the same
It's that HONEY
