[Hook X2]
Be my Monica, I’ll be your Quincy
This movie don’t have to have an ending
This type of love could last for a century
Be my ball player girl, reinvent me…

[Verse 1: Adverse]
Met the love of my life on a perfect summer night
She had that runner, shorty’s jumper was nice..
She was all legit, and her cross was sick…
She was the rim, I needed a shot at this…
We both shared the passion for the game
I started off slow, asked her for her name
Hopped out of my hoop dreams, on the court
The day I saw her, she stole my heart of course
And you couldn’t put that on a stat sheet
She had my heart fast breakin at a fast beat
With me on your side there wouldn’t be pain
I’d deal with all the Heat just to be her King James
She’s a female Jordan, rockin a pair of retros
This a crush I couldn’t bare to let go…
And I mean yo baby your handles are dope
But pick that ball up we could travel the globe
C’mon

[Verse 2: Adverse]
Her and cupid were shootin for the same thing
Her and those eyes are now my favorite team
Her shots go up n’ got my heart in a flurry
Want her to rock my ring while I’m rockin her jersey
Got me screaming everytime she drives n’ scores
I never get enough, always want Maya Moore…
I don’t think I could’ve met a better chick…
God dropped this dime and gave me the best assist
Believe me shorty you sweeter then that jump shot
Wanna be with you on the black top when the sun’s hot
I want a shot at love, be my shooting coach
Me and you would be so beautiful…
And your personality’s got me for life
We can be the best tandem since Scottie and Mike
You can be the Lakers, I’ll be your Kobe…
Believe me, I’m the only player that you’ll need
