Tryna do a lot and I’m tryna do too much

But compared to you I don’t really do much

But compared to you I really ain’t been through much


I swear I live my whole life full of comparisons

Positive ones to feed into my arrogance

Only care about ourselves we be living like Americans


I go on Rhymezone if I can’t think of rhymes

Sometimes when I’m in class I think I’m wasting my time

Memorizing content that I won’t ever use

Ever other line I’m saying how I never lose



I hit snooze when I wake up

I’d rather dream

I’m plotting schemes

But I’d rather sleep

I’d rather dream

I’d rather dream

I’d rather dream

I’d rather dream


I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive


I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive

I feel like my songs is getting too repetitive
