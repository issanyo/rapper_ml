[Hook]
I spend my whole day thinking why America ill
Crazy shit happens give me the chills
I ain't tryna live my life like them niggas with mills
In fact I'm tryna live my life like the the king of the hill

[Verse 1]
The corruption of the government is really gettin old
You don't know if but they tryna control the way we roll
Man I ain't havin it
And that's some crazy shit
Things happen everyday cuz of some crazy bitch
Or a nigga shootin or shootin a fool
Crooked cops don't stop unless they ain't in the mood
Fuckin faggots couldn't save a life if niggas ain't white
Hatin minorities, zimmermans verdict wasn't right..
And Casey Anthony was let on the loose
Killin a kid that ain't hers, man this world is so cruel
They gave us guns to kill each other then they took it away
We defenseless, comprehensive change lookin our way
Hey.. My city fucked up and always been hectic
Using weapons as a message just to show what they defense is
Senseless caught up in the messes
Tryna find a way out
With my diploma and now I'm tryna find my way out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This world is fucked up niggas getting killed over bullshit
Give em a wrong look you get the full clip
Why they so quick to catch a fuckin body
Go to every party and try to roll on everybody?
Lenny didn't hurt nobody he was thrown under the gutter
Got robbed and shot by a motherfucker
That was wanted his chain and wanted his fame
So they put a bullet in his brain that wanted his name
Cuz he wasn't giving up the nigga fought back
Like "Yo, that's my chain I just fuckin bought that"
If that was me in that predicament
I would of gave it to him
Like "Yo, you could have if dawg. I know what chu be doing
When I catch you in the rebound
Homie Ima fuck you up"
I can't even get enough of how sick this state got me
But Ima change the world
What could y'all do without me?
Let the haters talk ima walk on everyone who doubts me
I ain't even gon' say shit, on my walk my own shit
Shady ass nigga don't give a fuck
Doing the same shit
