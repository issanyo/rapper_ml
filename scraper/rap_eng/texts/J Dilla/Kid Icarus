Verse 1

Yea yea Kid Icarus
Wings on my back made of feather and wax
I got my bow in my hand
Arrows attached A B
You ain't ready when I hit the attack
I got a high ambition
Big big mission
Snakes tryna mess up my game they straight hissing
To the next level my aim I ain't missing
And I'm flying so high in they eyes I straight glisten
Whoah whoah
With my back to the line you ain't backstabbing mine
Cause I'm ending yo lines like
I'm ending my rhymes cause I'm hot
And only getting hotter
My goal to not stop oh

Hook

I'm Kid Icarus
I got the wings on my back
I'm Kid Icarus
I got the wings on my back
I'm Kid Icarus
I got the wings on my back

Verse 2

What what I'm Kid Icarus
Lyrics so sick they catch it
And stay sick with us
Standin out from all of these dudes
They can't sit with us
Starting and selecting the best you won't get with us
Starting XI uh
I be the winger that be wearing the 7
Gone for a minute but
Back in a second
White robe and sandles, looking like heaven yup
We dancing
Moving so fast on the wings they glancing
I'm flying to to the top of the game they landing
These snakes ain't catchin my plane they acting

Hook
