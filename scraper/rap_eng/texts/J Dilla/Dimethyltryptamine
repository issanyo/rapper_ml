[Verse: Jay Electronica]
Pigs with the heads of men spat acid
That lasered my third eye closed like LASIK
A midget in a casket like a baby in a bonnet
With a bottle and a basset horn playing the theme song
From Children of the Corn, oh I must be dreaming
A lady in a night gown puffing kush screaming
Signalled me over, "Psst, you with the waves
Iâ€™ve seen you from the Catholic church steeple diggin' graves
I got your number sonny
So ain't no use of fighting, yelling or running from me"
"I never ran ma'am", "Well then you ain't a clever man Sam"
Listen, the two-faced king from Britain and Rome
Had a baby in a bush on the grassy knoll
Where they peel back the orange head peel of a gnome
He said "Hey MC, I know you like killing 'em
You terrorized the skies for 25 millenniums
Now you settin fire to land
You the lion, you the savior, the messiah, the lamb
You need back up, you moving on the youth at dawn
Call Badu and get Tyrone on the megaphone
Tell'em I sent you and your codename is Megatron
If trouble comes use your brain like a telephone
He'll take you to the Chocolate City
Where two-face and the prince of darkness had a Committee of Snakes
Drill 'em, let the skin peel off to reveal him
Then spray 'em wit them rhymes you like spilling
Hit 'em up real, real good but don't kill him
We only want to burn him to the point that they willing
To give the location of the blank face villain
Who split atoms and give mushrooms to civilians
Hiroshima never recovered and all the evidence was smothered
Under a thick cloud of rubble
The pope is his brother
The hillsides is his mother
That statue with the torch and steel eyes is his lover
She's a harlot, who stood still like time while New York turned scarlet
And the levee monster sucked up New Orleans
While they was playin' man vs. man in Afghanistan
With they mind on Iran, Iraq and Sudan
Let him recruit you, he will try to use his powers to seduce you
Just let him think that the feeling is mutual
Because if he found out that you already knew
The atom had a positive, a negative and a neutral
He'll probably salute you
Then wait till you turn your back like a coward and shoot you
People this shit is crucial
