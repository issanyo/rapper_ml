[Intro]
Ronnie Cash
Carte Blanche
I told y'all it don't stop
For real
Show you how I get down for real
It's what you niggas a get

[Phat Kat]
I told you every time I spit I'm on some classic shit
Ronnie Cash and J Dilla on some massive shit
Why y'all niggas still fakin' on that plastic shit
We in the lab, concocting bombs, straight blastin' shit
When my red range changing lanes, pass that shit
Chicks at the lights, gotta 'em flashin' ass and tits
Called my wolves, niggas quick to have they asses bit
You know it's on when they pull up in them classic whips
Jumpin out with long barrels with expansion clips
Now you silly niggas really know its time to dip
Treat you like a broad, make you niggas dance and strip
You rappers need a style, I'm here to give you fashion tips
I'm in Belize having breakfast with the baddest bitch
Go ahead, smoke the [?], I'm blowin' lavish spliffs
Ronnie Cash, bitch, it don't get no liver than this
Carte Blanche, waiting on your little guest list
Yes this

[Elzhi]
From cowboys to indians, cops and robbers
Bloods and crips, Bush and Saddam imposters
Slugs from clips, trippy to the fuckin' tips
Thugs and pimps, man they moving their drugs for chips
They dug a ditch for little Leroy
He was only three
Cannon blown out stuffed animals on a tree
Froze to a stray bullet
Though it beared no name
When it whistled through the air prepare for aim
What could make a man cock and squeeze
On a block with ease
Pop through trees and knock the leaves
Somebody's shot can't possibly breathe
Possibly be, reach in your pocket for keys
Probably be between robbery, gangs, and dope fiends
For the coke dreams and get high from the vains
You got hitmen that's high as slain individuals
Now they live below the flowers in spring
Hear them lead showers that *pring* from under vehicles
You can read a few new leads into about the people who was killed
I'm sure when they planned before it
[?] same way yesterday and before it
You can high and fade away, pick up the plan, ignore it

[Phat Kat]
You phony rappers had your turn now it's time to go
I'm here to bring you live shows with legitimate flows
You still be rolling 50 deep, sweet as Cinnamon rolls
[?] black ten and a roll
Ronnie Cash, stay on the low, gettin that dough
I'm in that [?], nigga, watch my growth
I'm masterminding [?] all types a shit
But if I recite, ask that papi write my shit
They download me on the mp3, they bite my shit
While I sit back, roll my 3's,  relight my spliff
Spit your crystal flows, don't [?] bitch
I'm here with your main girl, you still wifin' that chick?
Right before I blow my load I put it right on her lips
I compliment your taste, dawg, she's got some marvelous tits
She comin' home, kissin' you, now that's some trifling shit
The type of shit that makes you wanna do some stiflin' shit
Like put your hands around your chick neck then tighten the grip
You couldn't keep your cool, but you couldn't follow the flip
[?]
You used to be a boss, now I just bought Kool-Aid on ya lips
