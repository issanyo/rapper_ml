Know u admire me but you inspire me entirely
If I had a journal woulda wrote this in my diary
Girl I can never say da words to ur face
So I thank da Lord for every word on this page
And every verse that u played
And every curse that u break
And every girl inside a church thats certain she's saved
And i've been thinking bout da guidance that our kids get
I show them magic and I ain't pulled a trick yet
Its all honest I promise so if u put me on a cam, I swear to drop jewels(juelz) like dipset
Maybe im loving too hard maybe cuffing too fast
Showing them light while stuck in da dark
Life is a bitch i've seen that chick stuffing her bra
Im just a little kid that come from afar
And i'm conflicted everytime I put my mum in a bar
But this one is for tish she told me all I write about is sex
She told me that my raps ain't really real
She told me I should dig deeper and tell da world just exactly how I feel
Like why do we shun virgins but praise hoes
Im just one person tryna save loads
I've been praying so much that i've shed tears
I watch my money getting smaller while my faith grows
Richard I love you like my brother man, fuck that last line coz ur brother man
We dnt share da same mother man but ur mother is like my mother man
And I knw sometimes we let da pain get da upper hand
We ain't spoke inna bit but ur my bro till da ditch
And ur sis got a kid lil phillip my yung buck for life
Writing lyrics hoping one day my dumb luck suffice
I be tryna live Christ like then get suprised when they crucify me
Shoulda known it was coming for the second time
Them niggas wanna kill chris I tell em get in line
Or step aside coz i'm still fighting my depression
