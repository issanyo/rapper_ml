[Intro]
Yeah, this goes out, to all my niggas
Rollin them big-ass trucks, them big-ass rims, Do!

[Hook]
Here in my truck
With Belvedere in my truck

Lemme see, all of my bitches
Get live wit it (twerk it)
Work it, twerk it Work it, twerk it
Let’s go Turn it up I, burn it up

[J Dilla]
Ay, lemme see who earnin ducks
Jeep Ass Niguh, burn ‘em up
Make niggas nod when they ride they cars
Dilla come out, niggas hide they cars
Dilla spent DOUGH on a whip, nigga
Twenty-inch chrome rims with the gold dip, nigga
Wanna go bigger, but they ain’t gon’ fit
Seen this nigga with deuce-tres on his
In the trucks, them girls be on
Bounce all day til the early morn
Dilla give you what you want
And if you in the truck right now then honk ya horn

[Hook]
Here in my truck With Belvedere in my cup
It got me feelin fucked up
But this is how we live in trucks (TRUCKS)

[J Dilla]
We bounce in them trucks with the beat in the back
Four, big, wheels, with the TVs to match
And all, through my system, tweeters and knock
My truck set off alarms, when it beat up yo’ block, let’s go

Lemme see who spent that
Dough on the whip, don’t gotta go rent that
In the hot whip. switchin lanes
D play to win, pick ya game
Y’all know McNast’ is the name
All truck niggas let yo’ system BANG!

[Hook]
Here in my truck, With Belvedere in my truck
Can you feel it? (Uh-huh)
Cause this is how we live in trucks (TRUCKS)
Here in my truck, With Belvedere in my cup
Get head while steerin my truck
Cause this is how we live in trucks (TRUCKS)
(Ah, burn it, uh!)
