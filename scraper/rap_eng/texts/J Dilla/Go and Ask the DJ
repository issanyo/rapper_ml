Who knew that we would blow it up, wide these, throw it up
We up in the spot, all the fine beat showing up
Showing out, yeah, we got them dollars and we throw it out
If you ain't gonna respect the gangsta you can walk about, walk it out
Or you can put your hands in the sky
Motherfuck looking cool, you can put 'em up high
Reach for the sky, your good day to die hard
And we see you, haters, that's why my niggas staying guard
And we gonna win the real outta you
That's the only thing a respectable player's gotta do
We keep giving you that rough rugged raw
Make your head snap back like a slap to your jaw
And we are thought in the California sunshine
And your jaw hurts, that's what I call a punch line
And if you got a problem how we play
You can go and ask the DJ for a replay, nigga
Go and ask the DJ for a replay
Go and ask the DJ for a replay
Go and ask the DJ for a replay

'Cause we fly and we soar in the sky like an eagle
Bodies on smash, moving fast, we might lead you
If you having any problems hearing what we say
You can go and ask the DJ for a replay
I'm from the lineage of dirt does and transformed that to hip hop earth mover
Wrote it in the heart of the ghetto and touched hearts across the world, word
That's another level so we never settle
Cash me out, advanced thinkers, you don't even know the half about
Half way to the show with half to blow, prepping backstage with another half to go
These rap cash poles like fast shows, no real in them so we don't deal with them
Honestly I'm surprised you guys still living
Whatever, you never affect my cheddar
My only dream is the fam get checks together
Now the snakes congregate and get checks together
Talking bad on the staff, respecting never
So when you see 'em in the spot, request my record, go!
Go and ask the DJ for a replay

You can go and ask the DJ for a replay
Came back stronger with my second deal
Came a long way with my brothers' skills
I can spit a bar a second when I'm in the car practice
And I'mma cause a car accident, I don't got the wheel
Writing on my pad 'cause this line is ill
I is back to the road, I is back to my girl
I have raps on my phone, I'm worth stacks full of gold
Ask that shorty you know that Christy blow
Every Tuesday she give me the love below
That's 'cause I'm a motherfucking KING
I'm a real MC and you AINT
You ground level and you wish that you could stay high with me
So when you look in the sky you know what you gonna see
