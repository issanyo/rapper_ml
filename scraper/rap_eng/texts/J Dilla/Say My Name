-Chorus
[La Peace & Moe Dirdee]
"No in Between Homie Crush the Weed, Let Get Loud in this bitch if you know what I mean?"
Yeah I think you know what I mean, Im a Bad Ma'Fucka if you know what I Mean, Uh Huh
If you know what I mean, Im' a Bad Ma'Fucka if you know what I mean!"THATS FOR DILLA DOG"...

Respect My Name, How its change the game
Im on Pace to Get Poppin, if you know what I mean
No in Between Homie Crush the Weed, Let Get Loud in this bitch if you know what I mean?"
Yeah I think you know what I mean, Im a Bad Ma'Fucka if you know what I Mean, Uh Huh
If you know what I mean, Im' a Bad Ma'Fucka if you know what I mean!

[Seven's Verse]

Ghea, DILLA, Slum-Villa, CONANT GARDEN VET

Huh, Yep

This the S.M.Dilla
Known Cake Sifter, My Shakes off the Richter

Sev Bake BLICKERS,Plate Scrape Mixtures
Flamb√© kicker from 8 to H-Pilla

Ate State Dinner, for 8 Straight Winters
Now you tell "Maggie Drake" it's Steak when I grill Up!!

Great Lake GUERILLA, Apes bout Scrilla
This the Trey One Trilla, NO BAPES, A "TOP-TEN'er"

Brick off the Mile, Bow from HP
Got a Blow from Pasquallie that can take a whole 3

What you Make a Oz I threw away on OC's
I Stacked a Bean off the Lean
Baked a Cake in 03'

(OOOH SHIT) I told the whole State EAT
Took the Steak in Roast BEEF, in case the Mission Go Green

I think this shit is Codeine, But Im A "Stones Throw" away from Cream
Bussin out My Jeans!!!

It Seems, That this DREAM expired with the BUS PASS
Wakin up on Conant Ave, Dilla Shit RUFF DRAFT!!
