I'm geeking out
I'm freaking out
Rhymes run through my veins
And they've slowly started leaking out
Peeking out and sneaking out
Tying them up, they're sneaking now
Crossed the plane of training
Enemies they're defeating now
Mouth is spitting rivers you deliver at a slither
Your weak lines are killer destroying my liver
Burr! Skills shiver, I'm hotter than a skillet
Flow Felix Felicis, pen's a wand and strong I wield it
Got that verbal magic you never knew that he had it
Now I'm popping out the top, and you're shocked by this dudes rappin'
Confusing with the persons, where's Waldo of wordage
And the who, what, when, why, Dan Howe-ing on this nerd shit
Feel the inertia from my force of mind
You're listening to an interaction of the fourth kind
Invaders left me with a hunger on this feast of beats I'll go nuts
Sipping on this Dilla, while I'm Dunkin' all these Donuts
Hold up, sixteen's short, won't be Ewoking on it
Crichton while I'm writin' AT-AT stomping on it
Foes are fighting Onix, rock throwing the hardest
Heightened and enlightened, striking comets on the garbage
And to clean up the issue, no intent to misuse
Never crumple pages, but got lines by the fist-full
Got donuts by the dish-full, just let these spins hit you
Yeah, I'll blow up, not a North Korean missile
Didn't hit before, but now you're saying I sunk your battle ship
You claimed to like me then, but that is just some cattle shit
P.S. your BS has grown some fertile greenness
Envy grows like ivy, consuming colosseums
And I see 'em, but I'm just gonna do mine
My advice for life: always keep you Pleasure Prime
