[Verse 1: WERDNAV]

Okay see this right here the comeback, steady off the boom bap
New school with a backpack while still rockin' a snapback
Dad hat, running through my woes to get some cash back
Off map and off top but smoother than a Cognac
I'm like the game's new Subaru hatchback
The face smacky smack that Drake caught at Puffy Puff's hands
We're past that, 0-100 in control of the match
That lit the fire under rap's ass
God damn, it's the new man, new plan, new stamp
Coming up pulling on his bootstraps, the new map
Reppin for my city but you know that
The fat cat geekin' off the fact that I am past that
Trash rap lyric attack, assassinating the whack acts
And the fact is that I am back
Spittin' smooth, making moves, please don't give me no slack
Man I'll wake up every day to put this knife in ya back
I'm with the issues, no need to diss you, go grab a tissue
I missed you, you wanna know the reason I dismiss you?
Bruh, you misuse your influence
A miscue that'll get you nothing less than final notice
You know this
Coming through with bars under hypnosis
You're sleeping, unnoticed, inspiring all the hopeless
Do you recall when rap was sinister and focused?
Now everyone can rap, man, I heard you, duly noted
Granted, I must admit my ego's slightly bloated
I'm floating on the notion every track's my magnum opus
I'm the Frodo of the forest, a hurricane to a tourist
A pit for Michael Vick and a Pitt for Edward Norton
Of course when I get tired of setting the pace
I'll turn around and see the tortoise slowly winning the race
I'll give chase and I'll stumble, BAM, flat on my face
A perfect metaphor, I embody style and grace
It's been a hell of a wait, but I'm great, I'm feeling fit again
Ready to display the main attraction on my Instagram
Got the illest lines, writing hits, collect my money, man
I got these twitter fingers but don't mean that I don't finish them
Damn, I'm intelligent and elegant
Spittin' shit that is relevant, never just for the hell of it
Throw in an unintentional diss amongst the references
The referee is saying I am in-bounds and heaven sent
Let me get another quote for the Twitter please
Let me get another flower for this centerpiece
Let me get another bevy of these enemies
Let me get another chance to drain them of their energy
Please
