[Intro]
Let's see which of my daughters love me more
(You’ll get some more land)
Why don’t you kiss daddy’s ass till his butt get sore
(The first daughter began)

[Verse 1]
Now daddy dearest, oh daddy dearest
I love you more than my existence, daddy dearest
More than words these can wield the matter, beyond all manner
My love is grander
No less than life, grace, health, beauty, or honor
Beloved father, beloved father, second daughter began her offer
My love is stronger, see my lord
Sister comes too short, my only choice is you
For I'm an enemy to all other joys
The last hija that had to speak up
She was the king’s favorita, a sweet demeanor
She couldn’t get her heart heave up
Yeah my love is strong, it’s true, not through words
But according to my bond with you

[Verse 2]
Oh no, the king lost his shit, went mad
Youngest daughter how dare you not kiss my ass
And she got banished to France
The ass-kissing brats got their halves of the land
What a dumbass dad
Two other brothers, from other mothers
The same father, different lovers, when under covers
I’m standing in the plague of custom, the bastard brother
He would get nothing I shall top the legit
Gotta come with something
It’s a conspiracy, pop, your son wants to kill you
Foppery of the world, he wants fill your shoes
And I hate to bear bad news
But we fought sir, I bleed, scared, he ran too
Many suckers, too many suckers
These parents thinking they could trust us
Like "I don’t love you, I love your power
Once I have it, I’ll kick you out
Go crazy, think about how you didn’t see ?
What, your eyes? You don’t need them now"

[Outro]
What, your eyes? You don’t need them now
We’re all dead, no one breathing now
Leering, not seeing how
It all went down, got families bleeding out
He is gone indeed, no ?
He is gone indeed, no ?
He is gone indeed, no ?
He is gone indeed, go- go-go- gone indeed, no ?
