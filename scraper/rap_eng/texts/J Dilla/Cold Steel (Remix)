"Cold steel"

[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
Yeah
Never involved in them brawls
My Beretta returns your phone calls, I'd rather chrome ya all, ya know?
Data in vogue like it's data and blow ya soul to Saturn
No matter how you roll I'd rather you go
To the cemetery or morgue with 10 or 12 of ya boys
Over hoes or money you're irrelevant
Whoever ain't nice, it's the gun or the knife
That'll number your night just once in this life that he's done it before
Now he's a glitch in history when mentionin' the mystery
A leader or henchmen we done heard it before
He never ? like a real suppose
To fill the 'dro and kill you befo' he feel you close
Now that's the price that you pay when the fightin' is done
You hesitated on life and died with a gun
Millions of suckers will freeze when the real approach him
And if you bluffin' then you go, the steel is cold

Thought you was good in the hood if you pull and he pull, he run from you, no?
That thing you got in your pants can stop any man but it's not in your hand so
And let us pray that the nigga you facin' is steel is as cold as yours, I hope
"Cold steel"
Now you a ho everybody know that you hold
