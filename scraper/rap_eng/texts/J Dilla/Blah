Sometimes dreams make me wonder
Awoken in the night from the rain and the thunder
Lookin up at the moon i am under, misunderstood
And my friends are talkin bout their goodwood
And i'm like leeme be that dude with the arrow, robin hood
Wait no, cupid, sorry i'm a bit stupid
Mc dupid, not a cool kid, but lots of people still cool with me
And this raps a bit silly, i don't even know what the point is
Like why did god send me
And gift me lyrically
I don't care about making a milli
So i do it for the friends if i get any
If i practice a bit i could get plently
I'm an mc, m.d.w. thats my initials
Standing in the drizzle, during recess
Waiting for dismisal so i can chistle rhymes
Don't compare raps to these epistles of mine
