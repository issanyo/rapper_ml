[Verse 1: Illa J]
Yeah uhh, yeah
Listen to this, and tell me what it sounds like
Uhh... stimulating soundbytes
While I seize firmly those hips
Movin closer and closer to those lips
I hear you shout my name
While the blood runs through my veins, this inherited
Musicality to help sooth your pains
With a perfect composition, that we've arranged
There is no competition, when it comes to me and you
Makin love, for sendin me this angel
It's someone I gotta thank above
For this uniquely distinct creative love
Unselfish benevolent, patient love
How you arouse my senses
Is flawless, you finish my sentences
With a finger to my lips - shhhhhh
I can't explain how much I love this

[Hook: Debi Nova]
Music makin lovin' and harmony
The melody and your energy
Sounds like sweet N soul sounds like
Ba-da-dah-oooh-ahhh
Through the night, whisperin in my ear
We'll sing the songs that we wanna hear
Sounds like sweet N soul sounds like
Ba-da-dah-oooh-ahhh

[Verse 2: Illa J]
Yeah check it, uhh, yeah
My favorite sound is the sound of strong affection
Your warm attachment, your body's contactin
I know you feel the excitement of these compassionate actions
Us love birds get involved in
And if we have a problem, we speak face to face start solvin
This relationship I put my all into
You, extending intensely inside
You just fill me with pride
It's so hard for me to hide the sensibilities
That you hear in these melodies
That's a gift, to help us to make that emotional shift
Into another galaxy, uhh
Our souls harmonize in my mind
Sexual, musical, over tones, overload
In my hard drive, while I share my life with you
And tonight let's do what we like to do every night

[Hook]

Ba-da-dah-oooh-ahhh
Ba, ba-da-dah-oooh-ee-ahhh

[Outro: Illa J]
I'm sittin here
Tryin to think of what to say
In space, it's just the music, it speaks for itself
That's all I gotta say
Jay Dee, Debi Nova, Illa J
Peace!
