Slack magnets fact is weekend crack addicts
Trap bandits basking in fragments of black magic
Back seat acrobatics box herbs watch tar blow
Charismatic to the charcoal with a scarred soul
But keep smoking peet potent got me Z zoning
It’s dog eat dog canis est canem when streets loathing
Out the pound like grey hounds and when the hay rounds
I spray sounds slay bounds proceed to break grounds
Close to breakdowns fat pockets full of great nouns
When fate downs in frayed gowns levitate surrounds
Rap Mozart when most art start to boast heart
Froze part of that no smart I proceed to ghost dart
No cameras only thing flashing is my life span
Inception vision rather cashing with a knife than
Living outside of rhythm kush kissing spliff licking
This shit sicken I’m clip quitting my trig click clicking
Whip skidding curb snick thicken when trip dipping
I’m track sick spitting slick ricking and chick ripping
Knuckles gripping finer smoke seeping out rhyming dope
My cypher choke jamming like the slider on your sniper broke
Lying hope relying on fucking rap or dying broke
Eyes blood shot I’m high watching them collide in scopes
Tie die eyes crying LSD fleece the one time
Coke aligned piecing together my piece of mind

What do you expect D’s on my girls chest
Pop E’s with opium give my piss test
Zest
Kinda class A kid bored in the cuckoos nest
D on my halo cap like my
Fuck you’s blessed
Get P’s though steel door locked in tired of
Living
Blow two O’s through one L call it hieroglyphing
Two O’s through
One L I call it hieroglyphing
Deadpool fired and spliffing bitch fired and spliffing

Flash pass recoil reflections in the shiny foil
Time lapse withdrawal round my throat ivy coil
Timed ninety seconds then bubbled up the spiny broil
Just out for a slimy spoil this that grimy royal
Opium shoot my bad thoughts like they plastic birds
Lone hearse wheeze to coffins from the gastric herbs
My head worn for worse from this graphic curse
Basket case this match stick slur jurassic verbs
You lightweight tragic squares over here fighting jolts
Time to watch Rome burn rewriting the lightning bolts
I wake each morning with ambition and a horse’s head
Hip-hop through my body coursing till I’m fucking dead
This anthem ode to methadone a death omen
Play the mad one’s demo then a
Breath stolen
I’m unheard screaming out that proxy oxygen
Its sloppy chops again on the dropsy rocks again
The rapper slash trapper I’m slashing up fakers
Winter’s discontent they call me springs breaker
Nina’s sinnerman with an awful case of cinder mouth
Rinse it out larger drought I’m something to whimper bout
In the martyr crown fuming off smoke from the sharper brown
And man your girl harbour doubt when her garters down
Told her, your boyfriends dick like a needle prick
Always coming back but in
The end you ain’t feeling shit

What do you expect D’s on my girls chest
Pop E’s with opium give my piss test zest
Kinda class A kid bored in the cuckoos nest
D on my halo cap like my fuck you’s blessed
Get P’s though steel door locked tired of living
Blow two O’s through one L call it hieroglyphing
Two O’s through one L I call it hieroglyphing
Deadpool fired and spliffing bitch fired and spliffing
