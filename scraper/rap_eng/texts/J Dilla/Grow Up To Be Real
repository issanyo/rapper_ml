[Verse 1: Sadhu]

Grow up to be real, streets need it
Concealed identities
So cleverly spilled like Cognac
For niggas entities, pills
They pop just to simmer down pain
People flock lanes, thrills
So cheap it's like crack on it's own thing
I range, no rove on my plane
Over ya enclove, I want that fame in my name
So light ya stove top
Shorty say she rock to my hip hop in the parking lot
Where they wager rocks
Cops on the hot patrol to lock kids up in the hole slot
This ain't rapper's genesis
The evidence is niggas sitting ice cold in decadence
Cohiba blunt wraps to max the mass confusion of facts
But deep down the Hill they got niggas packing Gats
Nigga
Fuck ya dilemma, nigga
I got own probs, no props to rappers tryna rap
From a box, double stuffed till I'm let loose
Fuse the blunt leaf with the brew
Watch the world undo and take two
Growing up real got me chill like you

[Hook: Erykah Badu sample]

'Cuz my high is coming down
Coming down, coming down

[Verse 2: Sadhu]

Grow up to be real
What's the deal with crack mothers, no meals
For starving sons n brothers
Feel neglected
In retrospective
Got ya eyes stocked for honest settings
Selfish beddings, got ya pops locked up
For condescending drug sessions
Mirror image of that old school prescription
Mic precision till my vocal like knife incision
Leave no witness, stab my track up
Be out like fathers who be stacking up they crack cuts
It's alright, it's just another day;s fight
In this battle there could only be one might
I learned right
Puffin my endo till my cerebellum is special
Paul Castellano typa-schemes
Fiend for supreme regime
Blazing Cohiba beams like a jet stream
My nigga Pharaoh been
A prince, play cassette dreams
Till we reach multi-mil and gold beams inflict
Cadet teams, try to blast us
With matter factions they sanction
It's all a nuisance
Fuck ya prudent movement
I'm fluent through the usage
Running ruthless with a 'fluence
Hope i don't diss those improving
Soothing sounds profound
To ya dome piece, rage like bull's clown
The mount I be climbing ain't found yet
Still 19 and broke but no sweat till I jet
And bounce out the fucking ghetto
Maybe one day, I'll grow up to see it mellow
Dimes i never peddled, I settled for reality
Growing up real got me wise in mentality, nigga

{Hook]

[Verse 3: Sadhu]

Grow up to be real
My man's chill with a humble grill
And a mega deal
Penicillin shots just to climb up the hill
Ain't no kings yet, the sins slept till
The royal session is over
And I won't stop till I'm blessed like Jehova
Over and out, niggas doubt i leave it torn
I'm teflon don coming through to bomb like lebanon's calm
Shout outs to Pharaoh the Santana
Rob D is the G and my niggas with they plan up
To succeed and free they caged minds
Growing up real just takes mad time
Growing up real and I can't unwind
Growing up real just too sublime nigga

Grow up the be real, what's the deal?
