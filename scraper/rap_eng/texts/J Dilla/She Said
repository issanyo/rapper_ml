Antenim - She Said [Prod. Jay Dilla]

[Verse 1]

Children In Paris While Francis Making Demands Of The Hazardous Scripts From Basillisk//
Antenim Reppin' Nazareth//
Don't Throw Stones Although Cannabis Stained Way Deep In The Larynx Kid//
Mind Is Bright Like A Lantern Lit, Flow Is Cold Like Atlanta Is//
Poles Where The Santa Live, Tea With Ice Is Like Antenim//
Need The Dice, Don't Throw Tantrums Since//
Jesus Christ Is My Advocate//
Fake Emcees Who Come Challenging//
Wish They Would Like Aladdin Did//
Weak Ass Flows Can't Be Paddled In//
Might As well  Just Be Babble Spit//

No Amulets, Best Protect Ya' Neck Else I'm Strangling//
While Wrangling , The Reason They Panic When The Mechanics In//
While Everybody Trynna' Walk On Skies Like Anikin//
I'm Adding Scripts To Soon Be Surpassing Sith As I Pass The Spit//
'n As It Is Attacking With Manuscripts 'n Dismantling//
This Man Chillin', They Flops Like A Sandle Is To An African//
Can Sir Spit, Then Smoke Em' Like Cancer Sticks That I'm Ashing Quick//
On Actavis, I'm The Best Decreed With Assassins Hits//

I'm Massive Since I Got To The Top With No Ladder In//
The Passage Which My Minds Like A Labyrinth//
You Best Lather Rinse//

Distinguished Flows That Extinguish Foes 'n Relinquish Those//
People Who Still Oppose, I'm Slitting Toes While Defeating Most//

Forbidden, Don't Try To Steal A Quote I Conceal Whats Wrote//
But Once I Reveal A Note, Emcees That Boast Are Like Meat 'N Toast//
I Eat Em Slow Like The Beef On Stoves That's Been Heated Yo//
My Rhymes Like Vegeta Cold, No Icicles In My Freezer Though//

But I Just Feast On Weak Emcees Like Im Goku// (On Tofu)
Go Super Saiyan With The Written Schemes Like I'm S'posed To//
I Stay At One With Earth 'n Grip The Cheeb From The Post Too//
I Post Two, Three times Seven Schemes, They Don't Know Zu//

But Once The Stacks Come Division Has Changed//
Your Vision Was Stained//
Commissions Like Permission For Dames//
To Come and Hug You Acting Friendly Reminiscing, But Shame//
The Past Stays In The Past So Lady You'll Do The Same// (uh)

Shout Out My Ex's, Yeah I Know That Yall See Me//
All Up On The TV//
I Told Em But No One Would Believe Me//
This Ones For The Reeds V's, and Everybody Else Who Don't Greet Me//
The People Wanting Contact Now Are Ones Who'd Delete Me// (Uh)

They Sending Greetings Cause Of Radio waves//
When Stations Have Played, Were Vacant Now The Ratios Changed//
Gregarious Dames, I've Blown Up Now Fellatio's Gained// (Uh)
(I've Blown Up Now Fellatio's Gained)

[Hook]

Now Everything In This Life Don't Stay The Same//
They Gon' Change//
They Ain't Gon' Act The Same Once You've Entered In The Game// (Stay Positive)
Keep Your Change//

[Verse 2: Nasty The Nastiest]

I Remain An Animal, Gathering Nouns And Adjectives//
Rap Is A Game Of Scrabble 'n Nasty's Had It With Blasphemous//
Tracks And Actual Actors Slash Actresses As well As Rappers Which//
Plan To Take Advantage Of The, Mentally Challenged Kids//
By Spreading Messages Which Are Bad As The Nastiest Manners Is//
And Your Babble Spit, That's The Shit That Just Saddens Him//
The Planet Is, In His Jacket Which He Hasn't Zipped//
Like These Rappers Lips, When He Shat On Em, With The Raps He Spits// (Brrrah!)
On Cancer Sticks But I'm Wrapping Spliffs Cause I Can't Resist Cannabis Like Attractive Chicks//

Antenim Has An Ant On Him//
Act As If I'm An Activist, Damn Isn't Act In Activist//
Pals Demand Him To Dazzle Em' And Its Actually Happening//
It Doesn't Matter If This Immaculate Characters Dad Is A Effin Advocate//
Cause He's Taking Advantage Raps Considered As Dragon Spit//
Amateurs In The Back Of A Van Of An Actual Ambulance Truck That's Actually Stuck In The Middle Of Traffic//
I'm NASTY AS F*ck//
