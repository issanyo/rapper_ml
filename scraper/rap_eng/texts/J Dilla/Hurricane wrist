Verse 1
Plug out in Atlanta
Sip that liquoer wit fanta
40 in my left pocket
Hit the bank make deposits
Not stopin like broken brakes
Bag him up throw him in the lake
My pockets eat like obese niggas
Double cross you diceased nigga
Cookin chicken no soul food
Bitches sendin me pics nude
White girl all in my nose
Sike na that was a joke
Marijuana is what I smoke
Hannah monatana is what I am selling
That loud as pack is what I be smelling
You talkin that shit I will leave yo ass swelling
Smoke blurring my vision
Gimme the money its yo decision
Im the general nigga so u better listen
Work part time in the kitchen water whipping
Chorus
(Gun shoootin) hear dem guns blam?
I got dat authentic shit dese niggas tryna scam
Hmu on that prepaid  bitch
Next week new number cops skeemin n shit
Hurricane hurricane hurricane wrist (whip whip)
I’m cookin up some mean ass shit
Hurricane hurricane hurricane wrist (whip whip)
Hmu 1 to 9 if you need some bricks
Verse 2
My wrist is fucking sparkling
Workin full time cause these crackheads keep barkin
My dick could use a swim so I hit my bitch up
That’s my main thot and I make that bitch hic-up
Obligation money makin
Hella racks compensation
These other rappers shitty like the john
I stay hidden like bhutton
Im incognito
On some real shit I killed amigos
Hit the strip club make precipitation
Money come back to me evaporation
Green leakin out my pockets condensation
Chorus
