INTRO:
Look
Every 28 hourz a black man, woman or child are murdered in these streets by police...
And not even 1% of these cowards get indicted....

#Yeah i heard dem sirens...

VERSE 1:
Look
Its a god damn shame
We need change
And not for a dollar
I mean change
Not to play games
We need change

This whole damn system is a shame
I mean a sham
If justice was a gun
When we shoot itll jam
Evrytime

If freedom do exist
Then im blind
Wheres it at?
Men lie, women lie
And they be fuckin up the stats

. .Thats y them numbers dont count
They dont tell the whole story...

Plant guns so it fits they story
#Juking the stats

Or their excuse is hes black
Hes black so hes strapped
Unarmed? But he deserved it
Know y?
Cuz He's black!

All they see is color
If u ain't white
U have no rights
Like a lefty wit no dribble

No rights like erything is wrong
Or
....Like..

The late dilla on the beat
Pardon me yall
The great dilla on the beat
Nah
I can't be calm

HOOK:
They say all cops ain't bad
Well... neither all of we
#still
They say
Black on black crime
Is Why they harass us in the streets

Unarmed with his hands up

Sooo allow me to say
N so its clear ill repeat
Fuck the police

Yup
Allow me to say
N so its clear ill repeat
Fuck the police...

I gotta yung black son
I find hard to raise him
When the judge the DA n these
Cops all racist

N a jury ca believe he thought
His gun was a taser
#they
Shot That girl in her sleep
No time did he face or

A man with his hands up
Is thought to b reaching
#and
Theyll choke a man out
Like a modern day lynching

#I mean
The nigga can't breath
Still they say he resisting
#Still
No true bill
Wtf r they sniffing?

N then we protest peacefully
The mayor said his piece n he
Sumhow They say disrespectin cops
#Unbelievable

They got obama on mute
He can't say what he feel?
Then
Was all up in arms when a cop gets killed?

All lives do matter right?
Wrong!
We dont have no rights
All we got left is to fight to da
#death

We can't
Fire wit fire
#Suppose to
Fight fire with water
But when ur backs against the wall
#U gotta
Fite ya way out the corner

#By any means necessary

HOOK:
They say all cops ain't bad
Well... neither all of we

Unarmed with his hands up
