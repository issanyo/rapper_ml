[Verse 1: Trey Christie]
Now it's the bombastic, shagadelic, digest them psychedelics
Impeccable fella, creatin' them top sellers, mind stellar
Dwellin' in Cinderella's love cellar
I tell her that she cool, we groovin' to old school
She said Trey Woods bust a rhythm, now I'm spittin'
Admittin' I'm narcissistic to my wit and
Some forgettin', tryin to fit in with today's trends
Well, I wish I could airbend like avatar
Eatin' caviar, ride my bike fuck the handlebars
Bruised up my kneecap, your feedback's irrelevant
Like I love elephants
What the fuck, oh shucks
Like gettin' called up front, you had to tuck your junk
I brought the funk, you funks
I'm past you chumps and your so-called swag
Throw up the flag before I drag you across the pavement
HA!
She mouthwide like she seen something amazing
I'm asian, caucasian, and black and I'm back
No mediocrity, I'm Socrates
Or Aristotle, sippin' from my bottle
With two models underneath my arms walkin' with a waddle
UH!
Now that's dope shit, too potent to leak
I hit the streets on the hunt for the feline
With a peace sign necklace
Eatin' breakfast at the mango bistro
From the east coast, wearin' creased clothes
I release flows just to leave y'all in awe
Rappers gettin' lockjaw cause all they do is gnaw
I'm back, matter of fact I'm feelin' reckless
Uh, Rich Boy Don't Have Netflix
