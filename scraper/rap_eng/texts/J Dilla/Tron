Pennywise demeanor not in violence but appearance who conceals his feels in bullets for his 9mm
At the theater I perform at I'm the leader of the pack but its so empty I speak louder for the people in the back
I've crossed the lines that I have drawn up just to see here it will take me
Pushed myself off the edge in hopes that I will land safely
Though with both hands shaky I rotate the globe 1080 degrees and place my pointer on a land to call a haven
Is it crazy that I'm dying to live? The most craven here to flaunt the mane a lion would lick
To get the blood off of his face after dining on ribs
I kid, it's so ironic cos my face is clean shaven
All aboard to make the great leap forward for a better tomorrow than that of days of before
Torn testaments leave questions explored and I plan during that tempest to go play in that storm
It created a lore as massive as the day I was born which is only spoken in secret like the Voldemort word
The more that it hurts, it maximizes soreness and burns
But what your character endures levels up your endurance
