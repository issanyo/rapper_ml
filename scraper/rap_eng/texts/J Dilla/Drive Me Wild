Tie me up baby, she said
Smackin' that ass, she said
She said
And then a
Drive me wild, come on baby, drive me wild
Come on, drive me wild, come on baby, drive me wild
Come on, do it, drive me wild, come on baby, drive me wild
She said
And then a
Picture me a brand-new Escalade, just pulled off the lot
Big-ass rims and a 50 wheel, bass, banging box
Take me out on the expressway, let's just drive for miles
I've never been driven, baby, you're the first
Come on baby, drive me wild
Picture me as an Impala, make that a '64
Yeah, that's it, hit the switches
Gangsta with the spokes
Picture me a brand-new Bentley, now it's time to ride in style
I've never been driven in the hood before, come on baby, drive me wild
Come on, drive me wild, come on baby drive me wild
Come on, baby, do it, drive me wild
Come on baby, drive me wild
Come on, drive me wild, come on baby drive me wild
She say
And then a
Let's go!
Yeah, just gonna slow it down
Just slow it down a little bit
I don't know if it's the boys on it or not
Just gonna creep through here...
