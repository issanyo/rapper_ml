[Verse 1]:

I get involved with people so they don't diminish
Yet I can't find peace, my trigger finger itching
25 to life is a sentence I can't finish
Better yet a bid, I'm trying to feed my kids
Egocentric with the style and the name
Bigger picture when your kid find a feel for the game
Hendricks influenced the way my light shines
Father-Time is fed up, reason I always fight time
Stomach empty from the lack motivation and depression
Either that or I'm ill minded with the pen I put pressure in
Faces fades and the days get more difficult
Tried to fuck me up in my vision peripheral
How in the hell?
Managed to get past my execution date
Ate 9 times outta ten I'm a food fanatic
On the verge on dying, you would think that I'm an addict
Losing sleep over beats, been so long that I been at it

[Hook]:

Why do I feel so insecure?
Tell the reason you're living for
At the right time
With the right mind
You can really find the answers to it

[Verse 2]:

I'm never scheming
I'm jotting down through the seasons
I could help you find the pieces
But I don't with fuck police, is
It as strange the way of life and I see things
Happen overnight
Like Kanye up in the spotlight
So many lives that I cherish through a musical genre
Provided me advice to get me out of problems
Beat machines, upbeat tempo percussion
After a few listens I wanted nothing else but it
Forget the hype we need poets but I'll hop on a trap beat and destroy it
This game is nothing to toy with
A hundred fuegos coming straight for your dome piece
Forgive me for my wrongs and this world that I'm exposing

[Hook]

[Bridge]:

Man I can't believe all of the things that I've provided
Mark up plus the details got me thinking its a process
Staring out the window and I'm trapped inside my mind it's
Hard to see these people go like I don't ever mind it
