We're all cut from the same cloth
I’m shooting for the stars but I'm afraid that my aims off
I gotta cop a scope to maximize my precision
I direct the barrels vision to ensure that I don't miss them
Let us dream big. Well wishes go so far
You can’t have without doing so get moving along
This product it speaks volumes but it comes with a cost
To come across that bridge can be compared to sounds in the dark
The boombap beatnik with a physique so ghastly
Whose monotony evacuates a room just like a gas leak
Brags about his raps cos he's not really an athlete
Competes in the rap race and ran more laps than track meets
Lastly, wait, there's more time for us to dawdle
As a thought evolves to something that can swing along a vaudeville type tune
It's hype but only a slight few
Will catch the wreckage of the ship I tried to sail before consumed
By the iceberg detailed as the theory of personality
Now I'm swimming in the waters of causality
