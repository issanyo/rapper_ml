[Verse 1: Xylan]
It goes drop the holy book, pick it back up, and repeat the action
This that Action Bronson shit mixed with a little bit of Pac son
The vibe of Fishscale with a little bit of Super Chron in it
Undun like The Roots, This is "How I Got Over"
No opinion this is truth, this ain't a trick it's a performance of fact
No sleeves, No rabbit in a hat
No clip in a gat, but a clip on a tape
Playing you the same footage you've seen, Death Grips you in the face
While you remain running in place, I'mma break that tape and tape it to an ace
Make it red like a hearts, you remain joking like a joker
I'm dead serious about this girl and I'm about to
Poker Face and tell her to bend that ass over
And by the time I'm done she'll say she's glad I cummed
And then retract her statement and say she's glad I came
I will then collect my thoughts and laugh "My Dame...
There's one direction you and I are going and that's the same"

[Verse 2: Xylan]
I'm not one for punchlines, I ain't one for plucks
I ain't one for rhyming just for bucks even if I could get bucks
But shucks, I'll say I'll cut a slut and make her sick my duck if it doubles my luck
Or chances at pushing a big Cadillac truck
Or having my face on every blog of the month
Seeing people dive on and off my set like a stunt
Friends calling that I used to mess with sayin' I've changed
Deranged since my pockets got change
Like that 2008 slogan that we all played
Like a game of baseball, put your Mitt on 2012 to infinity ya'll
This ain't about Democrat/Republican, this ain't about church or the government
This is about funkiness and soul that sometimes is troubling
This is music and passion that's breaking down walls, bring the rubble in
And cuddle in, let the sound waves be Pacific, drink the water don't be specific
Give them the puzzle, let them fix it
And if it happens to be you run along one who can't solve it
Take the incomplete image out they mind and dissolve it
Cause kid this game is a mirage
And I'm feeling a Nicki picki feeling about to MÃ©nage
