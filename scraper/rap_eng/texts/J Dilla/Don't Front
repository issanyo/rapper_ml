Yeah, ha

[verse]
I'm as ig'nant as a pimp's ring finger is
Too legit to quit like MC Hammer did
Ever since the kid was hollerin' at hoes, been bodying flows
Microphones inaugurated me so I have been chose
To be the president of setting precedents
It's true that I'm heaven sent 'cause evil is what I fight against
I hold the light against the dark
And I'm a pacifist but that don't mean that I won't spark
The jay up, then pass it to my brethren like a lay up
21702 is where I stay up, it's where I get my cake up
So I'm forever in debt, the veterans yes, I'm in it 'til death
With CMG that's my conglomerate
Don't sweat the tech just 'cause we up next
Show some love and feel the movement if you want some respect, my nigga
And it's as easy as that, so if you ever come at us then you better come correct
To be quite honest I'm like Ron Artest
I'm after world peace but get provoked into conflict
Just another victim of the system, cool
'Cause while I'm still alive they will not listen, to
The blueprints of my movement, I do's this
A DJ scratch couldn't abuse it more
Than my vocals, I'm going postal
Matter 'fact I'm going global yo, so don't front
Nah, nah, don't front
Don't Front
