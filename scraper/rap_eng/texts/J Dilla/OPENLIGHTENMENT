[Prod. J Dilla]

[Verse 1]
Rest in peace J Dilla
We all start out local but I ain't trynna be local
I'm gonna go loco trynna go global
All my focus is on mind elevation
All that hocus pocus is bad for my focal
And when we get the message through
That'll be a reservation for a celebration
For all the people who said we'd never make it
And imma get respect even if it takes story buildings to give illustrations
God please help me with this demonstration
God please block the demons from my meditation
God please block that bullet from that mothers baby
Let me mention this again and again
I'm sticking to lead and pen
Sparking minds letting humans lead to defiance
I'm lionhearted eyeing triumph
Always watching my mother on a Ritter 104
I never had a baby sitter waiting at the door

[Hook]
Too many malignant muthafuckas
All I wanna do is provide my for my mother
Don't be so deluded by the malicious intruders
I know this is abstruse coming from an reincarnated buddha
So serene, keep a cream mentality, I keep hearing kill em b
Now stand by while I kill every phony MC

[Verse 2]
Never know when a rhyme could come by the mind
Gripping this mic with so much vitality
This writing and rhyming this is my nicotine
My soul will live for eternity
Until then, humanity will go insanity with this music that I speak
I'm so patient with this flow
Starting off in a locked room with so much creation
Then on a pavement spitting to hearts that are racing
You feel that sensation, that electric relaxation
Yeah it'll get you rapidly in my generation
One two you've arrived at your destination
See Malcolm, see Martin, see PAC, see BIG, see Nelson
Just gaining for knowledge to my cerebral
Making myself more lethal making myself impeccable
Making others seem skeptical shouldn't be acting cynical
Next thing you know you in sorrow
Knees on the floor praying for better tomorrows
