[Verse 1:]
Words can't even explain what you do to my brain
Swerving in my lane and driving me insane
Yea can't be real must be a game
Must be good feel my wood it's time to fuck
Pussy so tall take you time rpm wake up like 4pm
Call your girls go see them while i’m up in the club with another slut
Bust another nut

[Chorus:]
Ah now it's just me and you again and we do all that freaky shit that we frequently do yeah And fuck what other people say they will never understand how
We can be so
They’ll never understand our loving
They can't do it like we do it
They don't have our understanding
Or do they know about me and you
About you about never understand what we have

[Verse 2:]
They never forget it we closer than a statistic
I pay you a visit it's more than just physical
I hit you senator i am your senator ‘what you got planning for
I swing an episode yes i’m in playing mode
Yes obviously eventually you take off your clothes
Never just casual now i’m in vaginal
We break laws we break rules we break parts
I might screw up just because i might just beat up like drums
I might fill up just your lungs
When i get enough i’m gone

[Chorus:]
Ah heat like Lebron creeping in the streets with
Freak from the club keisha michelle i like but not quite my type
So return cuse i know you the silent type
They’ll never understand our loving
They can't do it like we do it
They don't have our understanding
Or do they know about me and you
Yea they’ll never understand what we have

[Verse 3:]
She was my rush to go in
Low key my fantasy you go atlantic
Enchanted she loving this cannon
Feeling my velvet workload she jammin
Minus ten years they say she the baddest
In the crystal i saw i’m such a savage
She such an addict i gots to have it
Despite no sleep we fatigue we an addict
So when i’m in she feel every minute
Pussy the best when my clip is extended
But i got to go handle my business

[Chorus:]
So whats up with me and you
They’ll never understand our loving
They can't do it like we do it
They don't have our understanding
Or they know about me and you
They’ll never understand what we have
