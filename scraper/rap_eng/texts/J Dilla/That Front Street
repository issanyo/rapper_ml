Now every fake nigga nowadays tryna stunt
Bragging about that jail stunt
Knowing they get scared when they hear a tough guy grunt
Living on front street, and its over-crowded
The listening mass like to applaud loud these fakeries
Industry changing the roots, giving the boot to the real
Style switching up over hoes and a deal
Stealing, other’s hard work
Claiming that you did it since you came from the woodwork
Popping cork, clubbing late night watching booty twerk
The perks of soul selling, and I'm just sayin'
Never will I quit being me, you can’t pay me not to be
I rap for me, music, and the angel of mommy
Quote me, every man has a dream
But it takes the drive to achieve what he seek
If his future bleak then I speak
Knowledge so he can grow his family tree
All from the water of the mind
So stop it, with all that murder crime talk
All you really do homie is that Jay Walk
Claims from others that you like to push rock
Get the u-haul and move to the front block. (iiii)
