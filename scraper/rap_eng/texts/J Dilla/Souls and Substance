[Intro]

[Hook: Phil Bank$]
Don't sell, your soul, to fall in love
(repeat 4x)

[Verse 1]
Burberry London cologne, that be my fragrance, Orange soda crush a lot like I was a kid
Guess, ladies love me music like it was some sex shit
Niggas tryna grip up on my mic like it was addictive
Detective Sherlock Holmes couldn't even guess the essence
I don't got to ball like Jeremy for my Lens to be corrective
Screw the vision like R.I.P, to Pimp C and Jay Dee since I'm flowing on the beat
Just tryna sail my soul, not tryna sell my soul
Seems like I'm looking for love at the wrong Cornerstore
Can't block the emotion, 'cus when it rains it pours
Spend 50 cent on umbrella eye lashes when your eyes they pour
Proton the positivity, looking like you did electrons wrong when you shot for that Jay
Still rocking bucket hats like it's back in the day

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We used to kick it at the corner store just laying over
If strawberry milk could get you high then nigga I wasn't sober
Waiting on lil mama's with their mama's body to stop and notice
Chick named Olivia, looking at me, got me feeling like POTUS
And all my homies high, you would think that they were on drugs
Super Saturdays, after school, cartoons, blasting those new subs
Used to always be that one girl that couldn't wait to give you a hug
But I was stuck up in my ignorance
We never hit it off, I mean, granted I was 6 and she was 16
I think I had a chance, my superpowers mean
My underwear were clean, and my nose was snotty

[Hook]

Everybody's somebody's everything.... Nobody's nothing
(Some people are nothing.... Nah, I'm playing)
