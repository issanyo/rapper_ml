Suede...
Bout time we head..back to the stars


[Verse 1]
Send clouds to the celest' I'm on the best tree
Off my balcony, in late and I'm countin' cheese
Mitch lifestyle, mom's pissed I'm livin' foul
Spendin too much time in the stars, Jetson you need to come down
Never to return to Earth's preposterous guidelines I wasn't rockin' with from the jump
Like trampo' I lean
Hover craft, mentality Rambo, these suckas won't take me, don't give a damn yo
Dr. Spock serve me with the hotness on the slick tip
We split the dopest waves just to enlighten all the dimwits
Spittin galactic glass cribs but mad vintage
My wardrobe's a Benz E 320
Who kicks the rap scenes for fast green, money
Laughs when nothing seems funny
Traveling to the end of the universe on Silver Surfer's board
Told him I got him tomorrow with some weed, dummy
Back the next week with freaks and sneaks, he didn't trip on me
The flow's wine come sip on me
Deep red, rappin' one of my chicks to the sheets
Ya bed's looking large enough for you and me
Let's make it fast ain't got forever, no Keith Sweat
And me being high she fell through with the steep head
True story, teleported back to the north sector
For more fog
Drop this knowledge without flaw
Traveling cross the final frontier, geared with these star scriptures

[Hook]
Spark ya best and get lifted off the fly science
The block's highest, fast lane livin', The Mach Fivest
Futuristic lingo, we serve cock to ya bias
The sky sires, punchlines divide ions

[Verse 2]
Don't even stress if ya jet pack fails, no worries we'll ride the bass
Hope you got your tank there's no oxygen in space
No temptin' these, won't spill our recipe to verse Souffle
Secret ingredients are to remain, vaulted shut in my brain
The fame's a plus but not a major one
Popularity's straight but just give me that paper and come see yunGG's deeper than moon craters
Son shine infinite like that 35 G, S edition
Match his first intial, kill the game my first intention
Yo it's simple, memoirs of my days get scribbled in ways ya'll can't handle
Lampin' underground now my name gettin' hot, I'm the mantle
Body many a instrumental with the ill samples, chill, I still manage to
Its nothin, I'm laid the fuck back finesse cousin
Feelin' like KRIT on "Moon & Stars", only difference is I'm amongst 'em
With the live crew
We dig thick shorties as small as 5'2
Draped in women's BAPE cross Jam Jordan's, you fly boo
Just lace the sesh' with two more bodies and we can rendezvous
Roll a revolution's worth, proportions astronomical
Then galaxy hop
Ya people trippin, I'll swing you back by the palace, hit a U, cue speed, glanced at the watch
It's gettin late for even me, no curfew, biz to attend to
Bent like 10-2, plus on at 12 at the venue
Gotta rock this show back in sector 4, they've no patience
Dropped her from the stratosphere, back to the constellations

[Hook]
Spark ya best and get lifted off the fly science
The block's highest, fast lane livin', The Mach Fivest
Futuristic lingo, we serve cock to ya bias
The sky sires, punchlines divide ions
