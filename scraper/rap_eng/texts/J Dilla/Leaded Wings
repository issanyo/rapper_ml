[Verse]
Heavy is the head wearing crowns, I need a neck brace
Said our melanin is malignant we shouldn't test fate
Every time I simply seek out a metamorphosis
I can't graduate, and I shatter like ghetto porcelain
Tune in to politics, to be disconnected from nature
Ousted outcast, refuse to imbue the Matrix
The Land of the Free it is actually quite satirical
Cruel and unusual how their tactics are psycho-spiritual
Antiquated textbooks that’s a culture's seroquil
Seeped into the ecosphere now our sanity's nearin nil
Overseers veto legislation from the well intentioned
Claim to be in sync with the people, but yet they failed to mention
The contaminated water source
If we commit atrocities then that is just the par for course
On the pulpit runoff at the mouth for voting populace
Metal detectors in schools can't detect lead in the aqueducts

[Hook]
Written in the lettering soon as I get a head of steam
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
We should be gangbangers and pushers instead of vetting kings
Now we migrate cross wastelands call us the bedouins
Now we migrate cross wastelands call us the bedouins
It was pipe dreams when we simply wished for better things

[Verse]
Yellow journalists claim our situation’s innocuous
Paid shills rep the media, truth is apocrypha
I often ask, “what’s the point of a referendum if the whole entire system is stricken with despotism?”
Yearning to learn some discernment, because it’s the best decision
War of attrition, so mischievous that’s why I stress provisions
Sleepless nights but it is easy to rest on pessimism
Complacency, ingratiation is safe so let’s forgive them
Our exuberance is palpable, they leech it from us
Willingly swap it for houses and other creature comforts
Calculated efforts and diminished sensibilities
Bric-a-brac make us forget we’re amidst an enemy
Astute have recognized, Flint serves as the template
For a new kind of policy they’ll probably instate
Fascists will purport to be Biblical but their path isn’t
Pastor’s hands can’t pull from you up from this baptism

[Hook]
Written in the lettering soon as I get a head of steam
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
I can't fly, i'm weighed down by both my leaded wings
We should be gangbangers and pushers instead of vetting kings
Now we migrate cross wastelands call us the bedouins
Now we migrate cross wastelands call us the bedouins
It was pipe dreams when we simply wished for better things
