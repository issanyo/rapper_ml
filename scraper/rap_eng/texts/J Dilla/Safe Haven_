[Intro]
Woah woah woah hmm mmmm

[Verse 1]
Were always meant to be
It rains when you're away
So baby come a little closer
To me

[Pre-Chorus]
With every step I take
It feels a little deeper
Feels a little weaker
Inside of me
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm lost in a world (woah woah)

[Chorus]
So take me far away from here (oh woah oh)
Beyond the walls of the atmosphere
I don't know exactly where I wanna go
But I know when I'm with him
I feel like I'm at home
That's all that matters to me
So we're gonna go on a little vacation
We gonna drive all the nation
We're gonna fly, to our safe haven

[Verse 2]
Wish I could fix the broken parts of me
That nobody can fix
