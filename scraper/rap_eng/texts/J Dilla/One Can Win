[Verse 1]
Took it to the bridge, bought another hook
Came in the game, got you rap niggas shook
Neiman Marcus shoppin' on Michigan and Superior
In the house wear just tryna match the interior
Shag on the floor, Versace on the table
Money in the closet and my face is on the cable
Only one can win so I'm headed for the top
When I splash on the scene other niggas belly flop
I been making records you niggas just barely drop
I'm the master of my craft I'm keeping this here on lock
Flow until the death, flow until I'm out of breath
Ball out of control, too official for the ref

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Call me young Picasso, painting pictures vividly
Fake rappers and haters I cut em' down, no emery
Press your luck with me, and I'll hit you with that whammy
It's the rat pack niggas bogarting, call me Sammy
Davis on the track running miles on you junior
I'm tryna tell you I'm the truth, you can't believe the rumors
So misunderstood that's how it is when you're a misfit
Breathing life into the game, far too many nit wits
They all a bunch of lames, I got more swagger in my armpits
I'm the real deal and you other niggas counterfeit
(Yea) And there's only one that can win
So when they pass the crown to me you'll be looking at the new king

[Outro]
Country Club livin
Country Club feelin
People fail to realize that life ain't nothing but falling down seven times and getting up eight
I'm living proof of that you feel me
We outta here...
