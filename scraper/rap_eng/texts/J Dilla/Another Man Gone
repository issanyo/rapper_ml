One time for ya mind
Lemme tell you somethin'

Mellow like calm waves, palm trees I breeze through
Gentle with the age, beyond ease I reach you
I see you through the corneas, absorbin' a formula
Formulate a plan, the stance has enormous steps
Climbin' the poetry, rhymin' and morphin'
The mind mournin' my cousin who died from torment, his eyes closed in
The casket, his last breath was tragic
He had not a person by his side when he passed, kid
You can ask him how Heaven and God are
He'll smile at you and say, "Heaven beyond clouds"
You reach the pearly gates, God lets you in
"James, don't let the demon within get the win"
My cousin was tryna find a way
Tryna breathe life and survive the day
But the knife and the blade struck the side of his face
Now he lies in his grave, moms crying in pain

It's another man gone
It's another damn song

It's another man gone
Uh, it's another damn song

Peace

Play that back
