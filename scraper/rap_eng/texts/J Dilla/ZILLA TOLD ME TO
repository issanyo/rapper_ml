Refrain:
Just trying to be a light in a world so dark
What's a brother to do?
They call themselves the alt right
But we know that's just a farce - undercover and smooth

But I
Don't smother the groove
You gotta let it breathe

No matter what they tell us
We know we got propellers
Our strength is getting better, believe


Verse:

One time for the immigrants and fugees
I do music 'cause the lady from The Fugees
Moved me to write movies on loose leaf
Two degrees, now I kick it like I'm Bruce Lee
Usually I gotta move with the soul
And truthfully I see the roof about to blow
A big, bad wolf started huffing and puffing
And everybody thought he was bluffing
But he wasn't
There's something in the water, keep your eyes up
Spirit moving and the temperature going to rise up
Who you with, who you with, who be shining through you?
I got Ella Baker, Harriet, and Shaka Zulu
They be crawling on my clavicle
And they be tapping on my sternum
Prompt heart moves radical

We're dealing with some cartoon animals
But they got power, get your harpoon antied up

(Refrain)
