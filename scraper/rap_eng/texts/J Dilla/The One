[Intro: DELØ]
Now all the lovers in the house
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now all the lovers in the house
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now all the lovers in the house
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
For the one
Yeah
This is for the one

[Verse 1: DELØ]
Let's time travel
I guess it's time to unravel
The thoughts in my heart
Shining like sparks
I'm talking days before laptops
Social network
Days before likes
Defined your self worth
You show less
Which makes me want more
Never fake with the boy
Cause you’re always raw
We in the 60s for now
Let's enjoy the times
No sliding in the DMs
Only writing these lines
Love letters
Making sure there's no mistakes
I’m a delicate with your heart
So that ish won't break
I admit my mistakes
Could fill a whole nation
But you my brown sugar
Sanaa Lathan
I pay attention
Especially when you don't see
Your dreams, I support
In you, I believe
If I ever ever break your heart
It would be equivalent to me disrespecting God

[Chorus]
There are times
When you need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2: Jason Nkanga]
Now best believe
I’m not one for love letters
If it keeps you by my side
Then i think its quite clever
Grab that pen and a paper
And just write these rhymes
And profess that real love
In between these lines
Only thing I’d want falling
Would be you, not tears
You’re the one, I wanna build with
Imma stay for years
Matter of fact
Here for life
Thought I said this before
If you wanna start a family
We could open the door
Stay together till we grown
And get married
And get kids
Be the face Imma wake up to
I’m glad I put my seed
In the right perfect woman
Who be right for my kids
Be right there
When you’re down
I could handle all your flaws
Be the Janitor for you
Clean up every single mess
That them niggas put you through
We don grow old together
Rocking chairs, when we ninety
Be right there
Next to you
Nothing good ever last
We gon prove that ain’t true
We gon keep our love real
Nothing sketchy
Nothing shady
Live a Hollywood life
I do anything for you

[Hook]
There are times
When you need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3: DELØ]
I admit I lost faith in love
I need trust
Looking up to all the players
Who chase lust
Plus you are the one
Who makes the day bright
Nothing physical
But still my afternoon delight
A real lady
Well educated with class
Fine ass hell
Impersonated by the hour glass
God really didn't rush when he made you
A true blessing
I bet the good lord sent you
A true Queen
African and well respected
Elegant as usual
But never messed with
Plus you a freak at the right times
From the moonlight
Till the sunshines
I'll be there like all night
Making sure you comfortable
Feeding you like Clair Huxtable
I mean that's the least that I can do
For all the times you were there for me
Healing me like therapy
Baby girl you are all I need
Peace
Sheee

[Hook]
There are times
When you need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Outro]
I’ll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You need to look at the other side
You’ll agree
