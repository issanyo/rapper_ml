[Hook]
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that and uh
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that
[Verse 1]
I'm going insane
The man don't want hear the thoughts in my brain
I've been up for 3 nights
Rapid blinking
R-E-M sleeping
Pharaoh Nibbler
Among these space cadets
Third eye up
No wonder I'm restless
And reckless
No confessing
To my crimes
When I rhyme
A soul that came a long way
Within it's time
The pleasures all mine
When I'm kicking these flows
Show me a soul doesn't feel me
Like Bobby and Whitney
I'm Brown skinned so stay away from Houston
People think I'm confusing
I'm not I'm just a soul that wants to be heard
For every boy and girl
Take a hold of my words
I'm the voice of the living ghetto
Where the white man pulls strings like Geppetto
I guess they didn't get the memo
Follow my tempo
My voice is meant for
People thats trying to make a difference
We supossed to trust police not hope they stay away from our children
They shouldn't be the villain
We shouldn't be the victims
Now we stuck in this shit
Judicial criticism
It's bias
The ones we rely on aren't by us
Remember when they used to buy us
Then we got called nigga
And got violent
Had us in chains now we wear them with our newest items
[Hook]
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that and uh
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that
[Verse 2:]
Where's the justice
This cop on black shit and cutting it
We've got to stop it
More brothers in the pin
Than ones looking for jobs, shit
Timmy gets the spot
Jermaine remains jobless
This worlds about profits
Come out your pockets
Or put your hands up
Don't make a move
The wrong one could leave you leaking on your front stoop
Don't be fooled
Choose prayer before the violence
Nothing'll change until we try it
