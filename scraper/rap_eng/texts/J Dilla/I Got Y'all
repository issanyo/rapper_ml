[Jay Dee]
Its like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under my seat, to get it
And uh, niggas in their crew sayin im the bullshittin inside
Guess thats the reason ya'll niggas stay casting its a
Shame you gotta watch your, back
And niggas don't know jack or, bout a cast so
I'm sick of niggas poppin up in my crib
Ballin they mouths and shit, got me duckin
Dodgin under the fuckin matress and uh
Its time to undress these niggas that know my address
And this nigga don't take no mess
Call me papa boy
These prince niggas all wait, showin they ass for nothin
And ain't never around when shit starts jumpin off...
Your dogs, we in and bout to get that ass busted the fuck back
When that ass starts to actin up, boy you don't know how to act
Keep burnin ohh ohh

[Chorus]
And my mind say...
Keep it On
Rockin this beat, Ya'll
You don't stop Keep it On
You know I got Ya'll

[T3]
Counterfiet niggas be runnin
Tryin to to take shit or money that wasn't
Yours in the first place
You know how Wally gets, know my wallet, know how Wally gets
You know my money, and uh thats what my wallet gets
100 dollors bills be burning shit in the bottle shit
We make a ton of shit and uh, you not a part of it
If you get caught of it then, you just participate
You can't get blame-alistic, shame-alist regularly
These bitches in stiches and it just, gets ridiculous
Deliciously relentless. Till these niggas get transformed to niggas
To un-niggas, to anti-most-semi-niggas
Keep on
Ke-ke-ke-keep burnin ohh ohhh

[Chorus]
And my mind say...
Keep it On
Rockin this beat, Ya'll
You don't stop Keep it On
You know I got Ya'll

[Baatin]
You either: love em, leave em, mention em
Penetentury em, diss em, kiss em
Are you eligible? To be my lap dancer
Did you know I used to be a bachelor? With a widow
Who slept with a dido. I never get sentimental when I put up enough
Its like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I... (keep burnin)
Pierce. Because I never had no new apparel
As a fellow member of the mellow level
When it comes to sexual ecstacy I get a medal
Ke-ke-ke-keep burnin ohh ohhh

[Chorus]
And my mind say...
Keep it On
Rockin this beat, Ya'll
You don't stop Keep it On
You know I got Ya'll
