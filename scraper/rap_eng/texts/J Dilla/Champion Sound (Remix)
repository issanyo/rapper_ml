("Ha, yo, my nigga, this be your last warning")

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
Get up in it
Start her up
Get her washed dog, Armor All her up!
Big wheels, Cadillac grilled up
Keep your Esc' 'cause daddy's got the Dilla
Custom, plus them
22's but you say what's them?
3rd row, square 10's
I let the bass hit so they wear in
So loud, roll out
Tint the windows with the hydro cloud
Big trucks, best when it's cold out
Hear me pulling up in front of yo' house
When I hops in, it gets to choppin'
All Jeep niggas keep it knockin'

[Break]

[Verse 2: J Dilla]
Yeah, for my live bitches, ugh, yeah
Here we go, another chapter
I ain't lickin' no, neck no back, what
Better get my nuts, my sac
Whether in my truck, my pad
My thug niggas know what I mean
A live bitch, that's what I need
And I ain't about to spend no money on her
Nothing more than a hundred on her
To the stripper and I'm runnin' on her
In a minute I'll be cummin' on her
That's it, like that quick
Dilla Dawg, Madlib, that shit!
