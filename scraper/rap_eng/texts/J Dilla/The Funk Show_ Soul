[Intro]
Yeah...yo...yo...yo...yo...yo...
Some funky shit to kick your way...
Funky type shit....
Welcome to the Funk Show
We got the funk...
I'd like to personally welcome you to the Fat House
So welcome... C'mon in, everybody
Yeah, c'mon...c'mon...

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
People, I'm 'bout to spit that Rakim shit
I'm about to lyrically sock him, kid
These rhymes are toxic
If I see Drake, I shadowbox him
This is a project destined to explore the topic of alien optics
Shattering your nostrils and creating optical illusions
The alien's so shocking that it's firing rockets
Lobbing larvae in your pocket
Locked in the vessels- the mothership and dropships enter your city, bomb it
I kick back to watch it
Transmissions while explosions rock it
Hyper be my logic
You've never seen Aliens? Well, this is the cost, kid
Facing a xenomorph- you already lost, kid
Don't dip me- I'm caustic
You already lost it
Everybody jump- everybody get lost

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Jump! Jump! That's right...

[Verse 2]
I'm certainly not Hailie Mathers' status
But I don't need adoration- I need an apparatus
I don't rap just to get a reaction or get some action
It's what I feel like rapping
Ideas come thru when I have ample time
Sieve thru my mind to pick out the best rhymes
Believe me- this is not easy
I got tons of writtens, and all of them are cheesy
Most are ramblin', poorly done, or samplin'
They pile up in the attic, begging me to chant them
To gaze upon their surface
But their pleas are worthless
For certain, I murk rhymes until it's time for curtains
But I soon learned to write what I feel
Aliens, religion, or today's ordeal
Because songs aren't just for the masses
They're stress relievers everyday in the attic
So everyone here, remember and listen
Cause I'm writing about ending these people's existence
What what

[Chorus + Interlude]
They want you to jump
They want you to jump
Don't they?
Hypnotized by the beat
So they don't hear the lyrics within
Huh...I knew it
Yup yup..uh huh uh huh

[Chorus 2]
Well keep rocking
Keep blissfully rocking
Keep on blissfully rocking
Just keep on blissfully rocking
Blissfully ignorant
Blissfully ignorant
Blissfully ignorant
