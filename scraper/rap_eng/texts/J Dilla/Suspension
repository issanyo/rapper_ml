Hearing these melodies opened up my specialty
Rapping like a mother fucking monster, evil entities
I got a tendency, of Wild'n out
You treat me like a bitch then you better shut your mouth
I don't care about your role inside of this society
That's why I got suspended yet you still try to lye 'bout me
Eat the soap
It's forever on my record
I advise you revise what you wrote in the lies
Turn my "Fuck you" to a quote
Show it high up in the sky
Got a good guy turning rouge, and the kid is super wise

But I'm glad it happened
Sleeping through the day, in the evening I'm rapping
Mid-week Weekend. Not even weakened
Burning down that Poet-Tree on sunday, Fuck the Deacon
Nightly trips inside the astrals got me feeling natural
The fungus is the food, dine upon a couple capsules
