[Verse 1: JFKray]
I heard breathing keys but still made this happen
We raid the third world like aye aye captain
Metal plated hearts standing in a pastiche
That sleekly get away with a mile wide niche
Sheesh, and made it big from a little boy
Then give Iran a soundtrack of their missile toys
Drop the bomb that shocked the world thrice and not bar consequence
Even the kings would be put in a sarcophagus
Then frame Russia to blame for your duffer
The last face you see before death will be an usher
Loose and cold, the test won't be long, one - two
Truth be told I'm just dropping bombs on you
Radioactive, lethally spreading when I'm on
Breaking down MCs two sieverts I go and it ain't wrong
MK ultra's aged 50 years, imagine it now
Vultures picking our brains until we fathom to bow
And go under 6 feet deep submerged in liquid
Falling in a tunnel the spirit's gifted
Watch the shapes go by for eternity
Until your mind fights to become it's own adversary
Our 3rd eye's puny in size with the wider
Only bump into me in a hadron collider
Explore the galaxy in valency or agony
But the feds try and confine your fantasy strategy
I create shit brighter than whatever your grades are
The universe lighter combine with a quasar
As my thoughts get sucked to a black hole
To find dense fucked and dark to plant a flag pole
Then come back to spag bol
And get tossed aside on the mic like a ragdoll
Infinite expansion across the multiverse
To a place in a mansion with a lady and a bulky purse
Who rocks a clock on the right hand with diamonds
And cocks a Glock sinister pointing at owners of the islands
Got a shot right here
But fear of doom soon consumes her and she tears
Arms shake and tremble she wants to die last instead
She misses and the bullets fly past his head
Zooming through wormholes seeing it all
Viewing the same pictures and everyday fall
Discovering new waves to control the mind
Becoming new slaves that patrol behind
So find a way to break the speed of light
Cause dark might travel faster through fear at night
That's the way we get the memo
Not through positivity but death and escrow
I wonder will the lower class ever learn
To ponder if they see the truth that they better turn?
Imagine this from the POV of a solopsist
The brain at the bottom of a food chain whilst monarchist
25 crown and a dream  it seems
I find gold and sew up the game with my seed
To make food for thought till the day i get caught
And get thrown in jail for selling a plant that they bought
A pyramid that sees us the idea was genius
I got a fair O in my bank through Jesus
So I thank the lord and keep my head down working for his plan
At minimum wage as his swords behead Afghanistan
That's the day I ran back and figured out the truth
And this way i can slack but stay about the booth
If we knew what the feds did they say we'd lynch em
Isn't that convincing to end even those that hang with em
The government control the amount of crack sold
So they posses the souls and and all the black gold
