Hook

I'm just tryna find a little bit of love
In my life right now
Single life not right for me
Sick a girls tellin me
You ain't the type for me
Winter time
Winter time
I just need somebody
Ta hold me

Verse 1

Baby I know that you got a man
But think about it , i'm lonely
I'm sure he'll understand
Im pretty sure that he a fan
And if he talking shit
I'll show him pictures a you sucking dick on the gram

I dont want no problems
I want just a little bit love for night
I know you not my girl
But could you
Hold me tight
And tell me everything gon be alright

Coz i know i know i know
Cheating sucks
But its harder ta make that decision when you lonely as fuck
She got sway with it
I know that she liking it rough
Im pretty soft on the inside
I just play tough
She pull up to the crib.. 
With the silk on
Booty on another level
Titiies on that double cup

Its so good
When you hit it
You fall in love
My heart
Is fallin num
Anytime you call me baby
I'm gona come to you
I make you cum in the booth
Anythime you hear my voice
Crackle on the sound system
I know that you really miss em
But im here for you

Yeah
I dont got no time for bullshit no no
