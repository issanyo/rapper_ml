[Intro]
Don't talk
Here we really go
What I know about life?
Know about nothing, nothing
And what I know about
Is that I know nothing, nothing

[Verse 1]
Here we really go
Roaming in the night with a a lot a bit of fright like woah
Do you wanna really know about life?
Do you really wanna know?
I've been analyzing everything that I do
And I don't even wanna show
My deepest core, my deepest core
I'm lost, I'm scared
I move so unprepared
My presence always there
But my mind can't take your stare, no
No I do not wanna see you anymore
No I need to be alone with no remorse
I just needed you to leave and close the door
And don't let anybody in so I can feel it on my own

[Chorus]
I'm so damn selfish
But I know I can't help it
I'm so damn selfish
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, n-nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, n-nothing
Nothing no, no

[Verse 2]
Look at me right now
You tell me I'm your one
I'm scared as shit right now
I've been feeling insecure
I've been feeling open wounds
I just fell my life is ruined
Think I realized it too soon
I don't like your new perfume
And I know you don't like my tunes
I can't take your Golden shrooms
I will end up on that moon
On my own, I know I'll bloom

[Chorus]
I'm so damn selfish
But I know I can't help it
I'm so damn selfish
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, n-nothing
And what I know about life
Is that I know about nothing, n-nothing
Nothing no, no

[Verse 3]
Not a thing, no clue, what's even true
I've been questioning my life and the things that I gotta do (uh)
Beautiful quest, I'm blessed but hella stressed 'cause
I've never been obsessed with seeing figures on a check
But it's not like I'm not against getting racked out
But everytime I see Dollar bill man I pass out
'Cause J been building pyramids and this shit is getting serious
What helicopter's flying in the sky getting curious oh
What the hell they doing with the weather?
Frequency control, they say they do it for the better
Nah, I ain't tryna be corny, people needed to warn me
Mother Earth is deforming
Your mother Earth is ascending
People keep pretending they feel like they remembering
You gotta species with amnesia
And half a billion people getting seizures
From Rubbing on Mickey D's
Utterly disgusted
This is no assumption
Don't you know you function
Off whatever you've been munching?
I'm really just trusting myself and everyone in the world
'Cause everyone is the world
And everyone is a world within them
Why you think they call it a Universe?
Maybe it's united?
Something that we separate from trying to define it
Maybe by defining, we're killing all the beauty
And we're wasting all of our time and
Uh, I'm leaning for the vibin'
The joy and celebration of the rhyming
When no one categorizes
Shining of any individual defining themselves

[Chorus]
I'm so damn selfless
And I know I can't help it
I'm so damn selfless
And what I know about life
(I don't thing, I don't know a thing)
And what I wanna know about life
(I don't thing, I don't know a thing)
Wanna know about life
(I don't thing, I don't know a thing)
I wanna know about life
(I don't thing, I don't know a thing)
