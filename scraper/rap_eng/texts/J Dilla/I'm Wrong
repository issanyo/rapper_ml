[Hook]

Man I seen this little
Hottie in the parking lot
Cute face, but she really
Like to talk a lot
I said Ma I dont care
What you talkin' bout
I'm just waiting on you
To pull yo number out
So I can take you to my crib
And try to turn you out
Yes, I'm the type of nigga
Daddy warned about
And I'm wrong

[First Verse: Xav]

And I'm Wrong

Because of me your heart wept
And I would say I'm sorry
You been played my Atari
Cause you had the hottest body
All I thought is would you top me
When I saw you
My favourite part you had a car too

It was all through
No man to guard you
Till I swooped in and
Stole yo heart too
But like fresh J's it was all new
Saying that I loved you

From yo perception I'm deceptive
To yo pops I have a death wish
Yo mom she knew it
She detect it
Who could of guessed it the nigga
In the Macy's lot you left with
Wish you never texted yo
Only shit was double breasted

And I slid right in
Fit in the cavity
I took you out this
World like zero gravity
Broke through yo stainless chastity
Yo body was a blast for me
The cross you wore
In bed was blasphemy

Don't get mad at me

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Malcolm Elliott]

Yea, and I'm Wrong

Yo, Yo, Yo

It's me and Xav
On a track
Back to back
(Back)
This Food for thought
Imagine that
(that)

We went from
Blowing and recording
And spitting in the whip
To bumping through yo speakers
Look this how the story went

So I whispered to my homie
Like you peep
The lil Hottie with the body
Riding shottie
Was on me the whole party

He Said "You ain't gone smack though"
Man I think she got a man
But if she do
I'm out the back do'

Never been the man
Never Fidel Castro
With the cash flow
Never been the type
To grab 10
Right off the backboard
Not Brian Orakpo
But I can give you
Everything you wanted
And some you never ask for

Might be the Hennessy
Correct me if I'm wrong
But it seem like
You was in to me
Energy symphony
As you can see I talk a lot
When I'm nervous And I'm sorry
But if you not too busy
Meet me at the after-party

[Hook]

[verse 3: Malcolm and Xav]

Yea, and I'm Wrong

And I'm wrong girl

And I'm wrong for you
(repeat)
Not saying I'm a do you
Right, but I'm a try

And I'm for you

Not saying I'm a do you
Right, but I'm a try

(Repeat)
