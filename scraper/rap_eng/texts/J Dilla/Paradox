[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

I can't live for material bliss
All my tracks burn on some venereal shit
They'll cut you down deep like a caesarean slit
I go for the gusto but don't compare me to Chris now
They can't think outside the box and cubes
Now they wanna play the villain like Doctor Doom
I'm not the dude that you wanna go and block its true
Because ill have to demonstrate what a monster do
Used my words at first they yelled its a long shot, they yelled its a long shot
I take my job more serious than 30 mall cops, that's 30 Paul Blarts
Sold my soul?, Hell no, Mothafuck a pawn shop, Mothafuck a pawn shop
I made my sure my music bang I ain't talking Shawn pops
I ain't talking Shawn pops
I try, so hard but I stay true to the game
I'm using my brain to stray from the newest of ways
Besides the fact if I didn't then my noodles a waste
I'm in love with this art, I'm refusing to trace yeah

[Hook: They say they need some inspiration, but I don't need to buy it, I don't need that, I'm already flying (2x]

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]

I'm tryna climb to the top like, King Kong in 33 in an urgency
Inadvertently growing stronger,Now I emerge a beast
Yeah, every day that I wake up
I keep it real they maybelline, I'm paint brush
I got some shit up on my mind that I can't flush
Hopped out of bed cause my future looking Topanga
They not suited for this game like Ewing
Pursuing something that's positive got em acting like Eustace
Putrid, Kill my Vibe? Not with Scrooge Lips
Uh, and you can check out my wordplay
My lines hitting home like I ran from third base
Its plain to see that my heart into Hip Hop
I'm in that rookie spot earning stripes like Griff socks
If life sucks I want her swallowing my kids
I refuse to tap out, y'all ain't picking my pocket
And I refuse to tap out y'all ain't picking my pocket

[Hook: They say they need some inspiration, but I don't need to buy it, I don't need that, I'm already flying (2x]

And that's just how I do

I'm Alex Ruffin...And you just heard Uber..

Yeah!
