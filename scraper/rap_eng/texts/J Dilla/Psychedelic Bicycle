(Hook)
Broken highway
Broken
Broken into forty four

Lk.II pt. 1
Enemies can taste that fadeway launch on a airplane
Damn ..i have no name..just music coming foreign Notre Dame
See what i became. A monster put in a picture but soul came from the frame
"Wow that's insane!" spoken from third p.o.v
Need accomplish my goal. please ask what's my role
Looking in a manual down in the white rabbit hole
Enemies levitating out of the hole.. O forgot we have no spirit eyes based it on our nose
Um i can't be a mole!! Cuz Um still trying to find my role.. in a manual demonically controlled putting words in a two fold
Oh no.. Batter from my heart has came to silky dough to hot
Uhh no . i don't give my soul
Can not stop going to hip hop way too hot to never rot

(Hook)
Broken highway
Can't see the exit door

Lk.II pt.2
Hoppin out of a submarine rewind that I'm now stuck on this island
Remote controlled island. where everyone only say Hi man! Put my annoyed head in the white sand
Hearing things on that soda can.. Damn airplane came Yale
Drop with no food passengers came to a bad land
Annoyed head feelin the heat signature spiritually in a figure four. Adore the day because at night an island with zombies powerful gore
Never drop your soul better adore before the night gore
Too dark can't see the exit door or the white floor but a highway broke into forty four
Four was left out must be with sword. that stab the ferocious dinosaur
I knew their were giants. on this island raised to be defiant
Without violence why they want to take my soul. it shines brighter than...uh coal
But feels as throw up to frog & toad

(Chorus)
Frog
And
Toad
