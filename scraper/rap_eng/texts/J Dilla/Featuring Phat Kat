[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, I like this shit

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
You know over the years
I've seen emcee's come and emcee's go
Niggas on tour gettin paid doing wack ass shows
With gay ass flows y'all all some hoes to me
Phat Kat who you thought it was suppose to be?
You got a hot single now your ass 0 for 3
Phony niggas like you don't even come close to me
I'm from, Detroit City where my styles ain't free
Wanna hear some real shit? You gotta pay me
Gift was passed down through my family tree
My momma, my big brother, my two sisters and me
Ronnie Cash the ill bastard B
Get caught crossing my path end up a Kat-astrophe
Niggas is mad cause they hoes is drafting me
Fuck around with P going down in 3
Seconds flat put your bitch ass right on your back
Thats what you ho niggas get for fuckin with Kat
When my crew roll through you don't want no parts to that
Puttin flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat
Yea, want no parts to that
We putting flows to tracks in less than 10 minutes flat

[Hook:]
Oh oh, one time for your mind
It's game time
You know what I'm sayin'?
Here it is ya'll, yo yo yo
Hot damn, I'm the man, it's the man
I reside in the D you know
In the D ya'll, and this goes out to
All my hustler motherfuckers


[Verse 2: Phat Kat]
Ayo, I could give less than a fuck or whoever you claim to be
But Phat Kat on a mission to save The D
You suckers kill me watching too much TV
That's why most you hoes looking funny to me
When they say that shit, y'all go portray that shit
You brainwashed cause all day the radio play that shit
You think I care about your gold and platinum plaques nigga?
I tell you to your face that your ass is wack nigga
You know you bit your style from a fuckin wack nigga
A student, so please don't get it diluted
Undisputed D.E.T.R.O.I.T
Phat Kat that real nigga roll with that crew S.V
And I, got the key to be a true emcee
You lack the ability, discipline, swiftness, agility
Rhymes like these will leave you in mental facilities
On the fo'realla B [hooooo]

Ayo, yo, yo, turn it down a lil' bit
Ayo, let me know if this shit ever happen to you

[Skit begins]
