[Ace Cartar]
All I got is five dollas Imma use it for some annies
New day same shit, you already know the plan B
I never had a plan see, my dream was just my Plan A
So I light it up ttill I'm on a different planet
I can't take, dealing with niggas who act fake forget em
Fuck it we all human man so i can forgive
Cuz when I'm eatin I won't be the one regretting, stealing from the person that i was calling my bestfriend yo
Its ard tryna keep iit real when you rhyming be, Cuz bitches love true religion and
Designer tees. fast whips gold chains and them diamond rings
I gotta sit here nd be like yea she not for me
I can't front I want the riches and the bitches, A chick to lick my dick in whips just to be specific
But I left that path ause'I ain't just a statistic, I'm leavin codes messages these are my heiroglyphics, Encryted, in your crpyt when i went and writ this.Lifted
Like The Bar I'm raising for you misfits, These rappers tryna dicklick they speekin on some slick shit, just gimme a couple years I'll zzom down merrick with that stick shift

I used to wanna be the greatest rapper ever using old school flows payin homage to my elders
Fuck that, Fuck rap I'm all about my cheddar see that lyrical,Miracle Part of me has severed
My homies like yo man he buggin Ace Wildin, You have talent boy a skill you really profound in
If thats true tell me where the fuck is my crowd then, and spit a metaphor that makes my stomach stop growling
Its funny cuz i put my all I put my heart
I put my pen to paper cause they hatin bein apart, I spit my favorite 16 but you hate it fore i start. Then go bump the radio that a Mockery of my art
So fuck you go bump bands gone make her dance then
Fuck you follow the trends wear tight pants then. I'm tired of sayin keep and on & keep focused
I'm staring at my verse like yo'why the fuck i wrote this
But I gain hope in the fact that practice makes perfet, ignorers turn believers In each one of my verses
Is Prove that I'm here for a higher purpose
So i keep Faith Until all my blessing emerges
