[Intro]
Is it real?
Said is it real?

[Verse 1]
And this was back when I was seeing more weed than a weed whacker
Cutting checks left and right to get my brain higher
Can't aspire if I'm sitting high admiring a stupid ass vase that has a nice pattern
And your face is nice too, but that's a whole tangent
Back to spliffs - we was facing em with no manners
Niggas grabbing and backstabbing, like "gimme this and gimme that’s” a shame you do it all for an extra pass at it, addict
Attics is what you’re higher than, get it
Cellar level emotions plaguing them
And I said it and stand by it with whole hearted conviction
While I watch my niggas dabble in the finest Devil's lettuce
The best of them what Lucifer praying he gets
But thankfully the spirit not giving up yet
While me, I'm falling back on a pack of them cigarettes into the depths of blissful ignorance
That's my fucking comfort zone, best for me to ride alone
Blow my horn when I step in front of a microphone

[Hook]
Niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never ever say no more to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
And niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
Cause niggas never ever say no more to gas
Niggas never say no to gas

[Verse 2]
You hit me up when I was doing the nasty
With some other chick, wishing it was you if I can speak candidly
And now I’m tripping cause you say you ain’t wanna talk
So why you in my phone late night, that’s desperate - see, but
Remember when you said you don’t fuck with me?
You said you never really cared, no offense to me
I know I shouldn’t, but I’ll still hit you back cause in the back of my mind I’m still hoping that we back, so fuck it
Exchanging chit chat for a minute like “How you been” - “Who me? I’ve actually been quite alright”
And now I’m getting hype
Thinking that you’ve changed your mind and wanna to drive over to my crib for the best of nights
I know you like to play them games
I know your lonely ass just needs some company
But when I try to keep it
You pull a disappearing act, leave me wide eyed staring at the screen fiending, and disbelieving

[Hook]
Niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never ever say no more to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
And niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
Cause niggas never ever say no more to gas
Niggas never say no to gas

[Verse 3]
We arrive abruptly at the morning after
Where you find me feeling daft, falling for the trap faster than Jonnie Plass rounding tracks
Saran wrap what he looking for
Tryna pick the pieces up like fragment homes I’m coming from
And I guess it’d be a lie for me to say that I never cried or never wondered why
Cause I did that often
Hid behind some white lies like “I’m fucking fine” and kept it moving
Cause xG ain’t got time for no more losing
Drop the pretense - I know you tried to play me like a fucking pawn
But when it comes to mating, I’m the one who’s checking people off the listings, for real
So who’s ahead for real?
I copped the head for real
With no hard feelings although my dick’s soft and I’m kinda sad that we don’t talk
So like fuck it, it’s whatever, front like it’s whatever
I’d rather hide my tears until forever

[Hook] (x2)
Niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas

Niggas never say no to gas
And niggas never say no to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
Cause niggas never ever say no more to gas
Niggas never say no to gas
