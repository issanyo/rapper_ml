[Verse 1: Supa Emcee]
Y'all wanna bite and sample him
Screaming, "I got tracks by Dilla" (Nigga)
Nigga, Charles Hamilton
Lying for the camera, damage you, Jeru
Beat a nigga red 'til he think he Blood or Piru
On the internet like you know Ma Dukes
Well Ma Dukes'll probably puke at the site of you
Motown rebirthed a monster, no baby food
Still a nigga throw fits like babies do
Boost my heart, this is for the Yancey team
I wrote these words like James Yancey theme
(Give 'em horror Sup!)
Retribution, reverts behind a true score
(Scream!) Nigga, this Dilla music
Somehow the drum and hi-hat makes me abuse it
For Jay Dee I'm a soldier, every sound's a movement
General selector, army platoon shit
Welcome to Detroit, welcome back to the unit
Jay Dee said get 'em, nigga you getting bullwhipped
Set yourself to fall in love, nigga get poolsticked
Rest of your sins baptized in the pulpit
Dilla donuts get worldwide spins
Hundred percent Jay Dee, no Dilla pretend
Try to duplicate the trend, hope that Jay Dee'll send
All you Dilla stealing niggas, here's Jay Dee's revenge

[Hook]
If you could make music for the world, who would you be?
How would it sound? How would it feel?
Would it make you think of Motown and the heart that pound
The beat in the street, Dillatroit this is 313
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Nick Speed]
Rebirth motown, reassemble, recharge, recorded, relit, rekindled
I'm known to see different, you glow and we glisten
Breathe the scent and represent
Get choked for remixing, ego, we divided
I just washed the seam to the skull he provided
It's all in the news, you can go read about it
The more people hear Jay, the more he deposit
Hey Jay, they trying to eat off your name
Doing new things and it ain't even the same
The king with a board, they trying to figure you out
Start with a dream and then you invent a new route
Uh, it's powerful how it came together
Hit record in the zone and it stay forever
Timeless, I see it day and night
Everybody leave, then they coming back trying to make it right
Ecstasy and pain, ultra hard, dramatical
We bogart a attitude, old scars get tatted too
Come from the Hart Plaza, murder car capital
Broken dream boulevard, heard it all avenue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
A new beginning, focused on the dime in the year
It's no ending, things never seemed so clear
I take a second reflecting on the way stuff was
Was it hate, or was they giving me tough love
I don't know, still it made me who I am
Now I'm back, ready to pursue my plan
And now I'm back, ready to renew my stance
And like that, a nigga feeling new again, uh
Yeah and I'm right back on it
I'm living the dream with some nightmare moments, uh
But everybody has a story in the skyscraper of a building called glory
What's yours?
My music allows me to touch yours
Get called out for encores
Tell me, should I wan't more?
Of course I should, that's what I'm so charged for

[Hook]
