All That Camo on , Can you tell me what you hiding from
I'm from the slum , Tensions heat we grab 'a gun
When barrels heat just duck and run, Hoping you make it back to loved ones
They called us Lost Ones
Im looking at my brah, Like is we really lost son
Mobb Deep we causing Havoc
Alone we innocents caught In Sin City
15 and my life Insidious
You could keep ya pitty
Cause I dont need the Shit
I been threw greviences
Jot down so much , my pens been inkless
Before I spat gold , It was sterling silver
Wish I couldve got my mom some ruby slippers fore' she passed
Drowing in my sorrows , feel like acid baths
Went from top of my class ,To not even in class
Skipping school getting high off grass, and selling hash
Thats Life for a nigga
Till Dreams and reality , become one for a nigga
White pickit fences , maybach engines
They wanna see me in that 6 by 8
With caged blues
Orange jump suits & White canvas shoes
Its my life I gotta Choose
Am I after Two Chains and tru's
Nah I want grammys linning my mansions living room
And my family too, tell em pick a room
I know these the days I'll Always remember
Bitches giving cold shoulders
Like its always december
Is that a 90's baby
The last of a dying breed
98 in fact , keep the Nickel plate in tact
So we could play attack
If we have tii
Fuck they shine, Ill take they shine
Drink they wine , Threw platinum lined faucets
How I spit heat , like bbq pits
See my gold mind , they like arent you rich
But we all got a bit of fools Gold
Number 1's looking like cocaine
Back when flows was cracked
Now they cocaine
I need a rope chain
And a record deal , Talking 2 mill
Re Up on that house , in the hills
All I want is to build , All I want is the bills
