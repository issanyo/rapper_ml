[Intro]
Love can be a hindrance, just do not hinder love. It is what makes you strong

[Verse 1]
You got the passwords to everything
Why -ly like the end of an adverb
That's word to me, I could be a prick
I would be beating chicks if you didn't say you need me quick
Immediately, I switch from my promiscuous ways
Because I could've been tricking for days
Got money, now I don't have to look like I was bench pressing
To get sex from Karen Steffens, interesting
How attractive cash makes you
I used to rap on tracks even badder than today
You know it
Always kept about two poets
Who blow it on demand, exploded in their hand
Damn, I know you hate my past
But I gotta understand why you date my ass
I'm not special, babe, I'm just me, just C-H
So just see what I'm saying, trust me

[Hook]
Let's not pretend like I don't love you
No one replaces you
I let you in because I love you
No one replaces you
I smile again because I love you

We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby
We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby

[Verse 2]
I'm not the cutest, I just do music
Those that didn't blow it know they blew it
Those they blew it wish today they could blow it, but they blew it
Now they're sitting at home pissed on the phone looking stupid
By all means, I have a right to act foolish
But if I lose you, I could lose it
Then again, I got a good sense of self
But you treat me good, no sense to end the self felt
I don't want to be the new Leon Phelps
Well, I don't have a lisp
If smashing chicks by accident is my forte
Master of foreplay, more ways than one
Whore games were fun, but no games in this world are relationships
I cut my wrist for virgin blood, here, take a sip

[Hook]
Let's not pretend like I don't love you
No one replaces you
I let you in because I love you
No one replaces you
I smile again because I love you

We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby
We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby

[Verse 3]
Back when I wasn't getting no ass, I was suicidal
Now look, I'm a music idol
Because music's idle
So every wrist slash was either from depression or my inability to get ass
And make quick cash
I lick the blood off my blade, virgin blood
What the fuck I'mma say?
So when I say I'm a virgin, you know what is meant to me
With that said, you took my virginity
Yeah I chill with other chicks, but I'm not hittin
Cause I don't want to, so mama stop trippin
You think Vanessa and Angie can mess up this family?
They don't know who I am to be holding my hand
I'm still a loser with this music shit
A Sonic the Hedgehog enthusiast, but I'm so true to it
They're nothing higher than us, except me
When when I'm buying the dutch to get weed
But I stopped smoking

[Hook]
Let's not pretend like I don't love you
No one replaces you
I let you in because I love you
No one replaces you
I smile again because I love you

We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby
We got each other, we got each other
Baby, Baby

[Outro]
(Hitch)

Sara: I heard every word. You're a scam artist. You trick women into getting...

Hitch: Getting out of their own way, so great guys like, Charles
Hamilton, have a fighting chance. OK. No, no ,no. I want everybody to
Take a good look at this right now. Because this, this right here
This is why falling in love is so goddamn hard
(Bruce Almighty)

Bruce: How do you make somebody love you without affecting free will?

God: Welcome to my world son. You come up with an answer to that one
You let me know

But I love you, I love you. What did... just..what did I do wrong?
Just tell me. What did...

Dude! You're doing it right now

It works lightworks to find the one
