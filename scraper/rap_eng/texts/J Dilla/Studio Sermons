Intro: Bruv you know what it is yeah? Cos of Twitter and shit like that people are too ignorant and it's like.. social networking sites have people in a headlock and it's... sad... Trust me

Count your blessings cos you know you got 'em!
The other day your ancestors were pickin' cotton
Mentally slaves hunger remained unchanged through every season
& you could offer meals but their appetite was for freedom!
No names, just chains; a world without reason
& the sun don't shine even in relevant season so I
Raise my face to face the blue ceiling
Giving thanks cos there's nothing like family & breathing!
I preach better than the Deacon, my man King stressed
On the importance & power to forgive and forget!
& here's what he said, matter fact here's what he stated
Society sentenced to suffer if we stay spreading hatred
I'm quoting my patron, his words went straight to my head
Sort of like I'd taken shots from Wray & his Neph
Few thoughts later focused on progress
Equality isn't defined by colour or sex
I rap like a vet, my mum would say I rap like I'm blessed
With the, wisdom of Solomon the spirit of X
Lyrics will provoke your mind into personal reflect
They be the very definition of cause & effect
I'm warring ordinary boring barrers you should neglect
& if you bump their cd in your car then you should eject
I stopped the music for a year and just out of interest
Is it coincidence that when I left so did the sense?
I dunno.. vibe with me though..
