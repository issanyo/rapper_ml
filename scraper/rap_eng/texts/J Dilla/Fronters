KMX Fronters

Verse #1
Yo I be smoking on these blunts
Fucking all these smuts
Bashing out they guts
Posted on Jewel find me chilling in the cut
I talk to a girl already know what I want
But don’t front, yeah babe don’t stunt
Cause I ain’t chasing pussy, I’m chasing money
So if you fronting babe I’ll see you later honey
There’s other fish in the sea, women that wanna get with me
But X man not tryna get cuffed
And I ain’t talking if you not with getting fucked
Yeah Ice Cube said it the best
“I don’t conversate with pussy I ain’t gonna get”
So their ain’t shit to talk about if we not having sex
So don’t front ma and let me get that wet wet

Verse #2
Calling up hoes they ain’t picking up the cell
I like my pussy with that fucking butterscotch smell
Hate when hoes be frontin like Pharell
Fuck it tonight a lonely one oh well
Need to find a thick chick with the fucking cake
Fuck her real good and nut on her face
Man I hate sleeping alone like Drizzy Drake
Every night tryna breeze a trick threw too my place
Don’t be like “we just met today”
Don’t be like “X I don’t see you that way”
Why you frontin ma you don’t give me no play
You telling me I ain’t getting the pussy no way
It’s alright I won’t chase your ass okay
Cause pussy is something I can get anyday
And I got other hoes that’s with it anyway
So if you gonna front its nothing
But your home girl look aiight
Maybe we can do something something something
Babe stop frontin
