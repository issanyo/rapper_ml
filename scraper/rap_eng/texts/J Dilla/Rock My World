Dance, keep it rocking, girl
Want you to come and rock my world tonight
I'm lifting my chalice to Alice in Wonderland
I let her understand we can be super friends
Spending stupid ends, caught up in the lubricants
And dollars and come on, girl, you gotta let me in
I watch you shake your fast body like an hourglass
Rhythm don't stop at samba, a Cuban Jazz
You the future, girl, I ain't worried about the past
And presently I'm mesmerized by your sweet ass
Oh, your ass used to lure my blanket, the more free form, Jody Loo Bastard
My sneakers on, I just calmed the master, I whisper in the ear, make it last it
Dance, keep it rocking, girl
Want you to come and rock my world tonight
Take a chance, ain't no stopping, girl
I want you to come and rock my world tonight
Rock my world tonight
Damn hot, damn girl, I love the way you dance
See you in the corner, I'm loving the way you shake it
And working the muscles like you in the gym, mammy
If you get close to me you might feel the gym
And Jim is not slim, mammy, what you feeling is real
I wanna chill, just me and you, let's get on them wheels
And get out the club now 'cause you acting so naughty
Oh, lordy, guess I wanna leave the club with you, shorty
Please come with it, night is too thought out
And no, we're not going to flee, it's too early
40 ounce for me and one for you, shorty
Now we make a living among the G '
I just wanna see you
Dance, keep it rocking, girl
Want you to come and rock my world tonight
Take a chance, ain't no stopping, girl
I want you to come and rock my world tonight
Rock my world tonight
Girl, you shake it there, and if it's up to me
We'd be somewhere on the beach
And I love how we making it, them other dudes be faking it
Your booty, not your beauty, you can call me Sargent Nitty
And I'm here to do my duty, I'mma run up, run up
Like what's up, what's up
Girl you get to dance with me, got me feeling on your butt
I'm not being disrespectful, I just really think you're beautiful
And I'm the type of nigga I'mma come up with the usual
I been around the world about three or four times
Had a couple dope records, quicker than Busta Rhymes
Damn, you so fine, got me crazy like a '
Spin out, spin out so I can get myself right next to you
Ran out, ran out anything that I would have to do to get that
But if I ain't that dude then I'm a player, are you with that?
Give a dude some get back, give it like a pimp slap
Yeah, move it like that, I wanna see you
Dance, keep it rocking, girl
Want you to come and rock my world tonight
Take a chance, ain't no stopping, girl
I want you to come and rock my world tonight
Rock my world tonight
