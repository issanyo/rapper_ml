When in doubt I bar out until the stars out
My revolution aims to save the world and throw the czar out
Target had a sale on arts and crafts for me to start to draw designs which I can use on flags I've sown to leave my mark with
Esoteric though so do not bother to try
To compute my point of view through my kaleidoscope eyes
I have climbed up those isles of rocks puled up miles
While I was trying to survive during my time in exile
I'm an x-file into the eyes of psychiatrists
Textiles woven out of pains what keeps the style fresh
The vilest poems under pressure turn childish
The roses stay red while the later stay violet
Diet consists of lots of vegetable dishes
To fans I'm never dismissive but give them Eskimo kisses from a distance
Don't want to get my messages twisted when giving thanks for the listen because I don't mean something different
