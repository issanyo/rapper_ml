[Intro: Caine Casanova]
"Amir don't you know?"
Peer pressures' got hold
Holding on a tight grip
Common sense
Temptation takes over
Don't give in
It's the beauty in all
It's the beauty in all
Don't give in
It's the beauty in all
It's the beauty in all

[Verse 1: Caine Casanova]
Heavenly god body we're learning too much
Far from little
Too much attention our importance misjudges
Still blinded by your attraction
Perfections and all
Polish charm with your elegance
Foolishness would withdrawal
Think about handcuffs
Is that horny enough?
Fucked up & waking up to your makeup undone
Beautiful diamond in the rough
Swear I put you above over any & everyone
And salary income
Â 

[Chorus]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true

[Verse 2: Caine Casanova]
Heavenly God body fascination allure
I need more of that premature nature that you secure
For sure we'll endure all the shit & manure
Reassure our faith's pure
Let temptation take course
From my rhythm to your appeal
Our charisma's unreal precious jewel with this chemistry
We'll treasure vanadium steel
Unseal reality enhance your technique
Fuck up the bed sheets then fall right back to sleep
See my gift is my curse and you're highly concerned
That my life will be reversed with my casualties burned
Benefiting from my blessings pleasuring value & worth
But besides this rap shit you will always come first

[Chorus: Caine Casanova]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true

[Verse 3: Caine Casanova]
Heavenly God body your balance is good
Spectacular looking person through your whole womanhood
From romance to friendship our shit is endless
Our love's pretentious your heart's tremendous
Good will and high spirits
Too long be steering down a path of righteous
That's been guiding us to the nearest edge of prosperity
I need clarity your popularity makes me think of you regularly
Cause you know everybody and they know you
But you live behind all the problems we go through
I think we overdue our love
Don't you?
I'm drunk off this Hennessey parked in the section
Of your avenue
Thinking about you how played me
How I'm mistaken or how that's not my baby
Or any time you had called me crazy
"Clayton how did you fall for a goddess without regarding
All her beauty in all?"

[Chorus]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true
(When you're dreams come true) 4x

[Outro: Prevayle]
Oh shit fuzz we got one
Shut the door, shut the door!
