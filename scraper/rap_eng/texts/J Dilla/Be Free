[Verse 1]

Uhhh

A lonely teen just tryna change the world and make it out

Walking down the streets of portsmouth tryna take the safest route

At third baptist you see homeless men sleep

Walk to the mcdonald's and its men who beg for something to eat

And the same old heads who role dice behind the motel

Be the ones who wish they had enough money for to go there

Billboards say its a new life for you at T.C.C

But everytime I look its new black faces on T.V. screens

Man that shit make me regret doing alot of shit

How we still slaves when we were told that they abolished it?

Yall say that I'm the best cause I say whats behind the heart

And put my soul in paper so this shit sound like my final thoughts

Im the instigatar, i always tell the truth you hiding

Go tell yo neighbors matter fact go tell who you confide in

I dream of salvation so I spit with my eyes closed

Feel like a slave who blinded by freedoms blindfold, drive slow

[Hook x2]

I got dreams to be free

I got dreams to be free

Only thing that I see

Is darkness that won't leave


[Verse]

I know this shit I'm spitting now is sounding painful

And it prolly make alot of yall believe really ain't hope

Like the time Jermaine told me I sounded like j cole

And I prolly didn't show it but it touched me in my faint soul

It made me feel good until cassandra said she hated it

And wanted me to turn it off, i regreted I played the shit

Its crazy cause I never show how hurt my feelings be

I smiled when she said it but deep inside it was killing me

I guess a black man can never fully live his dream

Unless you a convict who found god and went to ministry

Now how you think that's gone effect the youth and adolescence

Its black teachers with no answers when you ask that question

But still we live through a everyday basis

Not investing on our future, but taking every vacation

Y'all confusing me, sounding rudimentatry, your music be
The reason why I can't get through to these

Kids

[Hook x2]

I got dreams to be free

I got dreams to be free

Only thing that I see

Is darkness that won't leave


[Verse 3]

I'm only 19 but my mindset is 41

So I save money instead of buying that poison blount

Niggas thinking they hard shit cause they can sport a gun

When they should be in books, but hey they prolly ain't een thought it once

But then again they prolly out here tryna dodge a punch

Or moms screaming in the streets the cops done shot her son

Or prolly asking when the next person adopting us

I'm tired of going home to home, why they keep dropping us

Am I too bad a kid, is it cause I got lots of guts

The other kids be mean to me cause I don't box enough

But when I do fight, the police come lock us up

And if they don't, then they kill us on the block and stuff

So why resist being the headline of obituaries

Why is this something I'm drawing out to a visionary

Why is that same visionary vision's blurry, And he don't see my people dying fast and the fact we living scary


[Hook x2]

I got dreams to be free

I got dreams to be free

Only thing that I see

Is darkness that won't leave




[Verse]

Everyday I hear about somebody bout to die

And it cut my soul, thats why it seems im bout to cry

I mean fr, it cut deep enough to create a scab

I never met the victims but I love em like leeasha sabb

I pray to God everyday ion lose another brother

I pray to God everyday to watch over my mother

I pray to God that my father will watch me perform

I pray I don't get stage fright again when I go on

I pray these transparent chains will leave up off my people

I pray nobody get shot for looking through they peep holes

I pray that my youngest brother have a better life than me

Pray he Finish school, get a wife and do it rightfully

Pray that my ex girlfriend understands that she was hurting me

And she took my heart out the body like she removed it surgically

I pray the homeless will finally get they life together

I pray that we stand strong as a people and unite forever


[Hook x2]

I got dreams to be free

I got dreams to be free

Only thing that I see

Is darkness that won't leave
