[Chorus]
Uh
The kid from your neighborhood
I'm just a kid from ya
The kid from your neighborhood
Gimme sugar like a neighbor would, I like that
So far to go but I'm on the right track

[Intro]
Word to Dilla
Word to the other side of the pilla
That's cool, that's chill (Haha)
That's real
Alright look
Uh

[Verse 1]
Never thought I feel alive like this
Got me in the sky like this, cloud nine
Believe me I'm
Feelin' fine like you are
Where they find you, I'll never be too far
Now ain't that somethin'
You don't gotta worry 'bout, 'bout nothin'
I'll keep grindin', you just keep bumpin'
This music, this music, find a beat and lose it
They call that ironic
And I'ma rap 'til they call Pack iconic
The realness, the realness
You don't gotta touch it to feel this
Let it ride like you all in
Let it ride like you ballin'
Gotchu so high but you ain't fallin'
I'd answer my phone but you ain't callin'
'Cause you right here with me and right here is where you should be with

[Chorus]
The kid from your neighborhood
I'm just a kid from ya
The kid from your neighborhood
Gimme sugar like a neighbor would, I like that
So far to go but I'm on the right track

[Verse 2]
Yeah
'Tis the season to bring the keys in
Leaves back on the trees and they breezin'
Everything good, everything nice
When I get there I'ma give you everything twice
And you don't have to ask
You deserve it
I know we ain't perfect but when the waves come we can surf it
It really ain't no thing
Feels brand new but it ain't no fling
This here's gon' last
As we get older these years go fast
And I ain't tryin' to waste it but I can say this
Long as I'm with you, I'll watch the years go past

[Outro]
The kid from your neighborhood
I'm just a kid from ya
The kid from your neighborhood
Gimme sugar like a neighbor would, uh
The kid from, uh
