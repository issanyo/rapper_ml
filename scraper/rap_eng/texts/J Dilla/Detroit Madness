Yeah, ah, Dilla, Ronnie Euro, Rebirth
Damn this shit sound good

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
Now through the shattered dreams
And the battle things, elaborate schemes
That’s where tragedy intervenes
It had to be a spleen, where that rusty bullet laid at
Somebody came through with the k, and they blazed that
Packs of the elephant, mackin' Mt. Elliott
Stacked 'cause I’m sellin' shit
Bumpin' Big Proof, and that Dilla shit
Think about bumpin' Big Proof, and that Dilla shit
Think about bumpin' Big Proof, and that Dilla shit
Think about breedin', bow my head to Flint
I represent the blades, the wipeouts
The days with the lights out and gas off
I’m the people's champ, y’all still rapping that ass off
You are the rebirth sound, and the cat's heart
Will always be 1st Down
Damn I’m missin' him, comin' from your real home boys
So I know that you're listenin'
Look in your mama eyes
Now I know what the mission is
Ma Dukes anointed the queen now
Got her a team now
She walk, we join hands, the whole damn team bow
It’s in the hands of real dudes that pay real dues
All she do is make the call and we'll move
On anybody delinquent, misusin' the legacy
Not payin' a treasury, I’ma be an accessory
It’s Ronnie Euro, the legend
Paint the mural, Money Truck's the label
RIP to …? yeah
RIP to ...?

[Chorus: ? (Phat Kat)]
It’s just that Detroit madness (Yeah...it's Detroit, baby)
Where everything is tragic (crazy)
That Detroit madness

[Verse 2: Phat Kat]
Now everybody think they a boss
They shine with high floss, they don’t apologize
They say, "my fault"
No more cryin', get you some tissue
No early dismiss you, Ronnie Euro tacklin' issues
They losing they homes, school funding is misused
Wild west, CCW, old ladies got pistols
Gotta defend they self, fuck blowing the whistle
It’s criminal the vibe, mental chaos they put us through
Dave Bing cut the grass at the park so kids could hoola hoop
And swing on the monkey bars
They go hungry and starve for the money and the cars
Niggas find theyself a custody charge
'Cause they thought they ass was mercury hard
And they ended up unluckily scarred
Niggas out here praying the luxury guard
Like fuck a regard, for life, and your daddy is Facebook
Get you estate took, nigga, over that fake look
(chuckles)

That’s just that D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D (fades)
