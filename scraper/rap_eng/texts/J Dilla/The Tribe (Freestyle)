[Verse 1: Amarii Davu]
I come from Nashville, Jo Johnston
Back in the 90's that was Compton
To us Nashville niggas
Bustin' them triggers
I wasn't even thinking about these lyrics
But now I got a feeling (got a feeling), No pencil (no pencil)
Freestyling (freestyling), Acapella (acapella)
I'm tryna sign to Roc-A-Fella or RocNation
Hey, let me get up on my job
Why you niggas hatin'?
Now let me
Spit this shit to the fullest into your ears
The hardest motherfucker of the year
Album of the year
I'm creating that shit right c'here
Let the crowd cheer
Let the crowd get loud
Yea! I see you niggas smoking loud
Smoking on them blunts
Nigga what's that junt right there?
Let me bang that bitch right here
And let me get it down right here
Yea, yea

[Verse 2: Amarii Davu]
My momma used to hate that I was rapping
My daddy used to think that I was trapping
My uncle used to think that I was clapping
He would call me AK, yea yea, but now it stopped
Everybody know I'm cream of crop
Whenever I drop
Videos in the studio, I be killing these motherfuckers
It's so simple
Bust a motherfucker like a pimple, with no riddles
I
Kill these motherfuckers to the death
Kill them dead, .7 lead
Send it to his head
Arm, leg, leg, arm head
That's Allah, you can't bother
Y'all don't want to see a motherfucker like me proper
Sitting in that '67 Impala
Blood red when I'm riding through your city (through your city)
Blood red when I'm riding in your city like (through your city)
Yea, and I'm riding with my Tribe
Spit that shit live every time I'm on the mic
Yea, they wanna ask me what it's like
To be a young star in this motherfucking paint
Shit, it feel live than a motherfucker
Yea, It feel live than a motherfucker
Yea, these motherfuckers be lying to ya
But I'ma give y'all that real shit

[Bridge]
Yea in the tribe
Yea I'm with the Tribe (Ok, Ok)
Yea I'm with the Tribe (He with the Tribe, Tribe)

We in the Tribe (He with the Tribe, Tribe)

[Chorus]
I got my nigga J Watts in the Tribe (Ok, Ok)

And now a nigga like me is signing out (He with the Tribe, Tribe)
