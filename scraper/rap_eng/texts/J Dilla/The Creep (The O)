[Verse 1]
Oh oh oh oh
Turn it up yeah

Can't fool me nope I play the game well
It’s D I double L baby
On the creep you home asleep she boning me
I know the steez baby I know it cheat
I’m down with O.P.P yeah you know me
Naw I’m not a player I just crush a lot
Low key pimpin keep it on a hush a lot
Don’t keep slippin cause she’ll get hers back if they don’t pay attention to her neck her back
Just like that she tired of waiting to exhale
She wait til you waze to blaze my nextel

[Verse 2]
On a creep in the club busting all sex on the beach
Ya’ll know the Ceelo with these closet freaks
They get nasty like a storyline on Dawson’s Creek
I had one that I talked in the jeep cause she don’t really get it often
Her man keeps falling asleep and they say what he won’t do somebody will
He better hope somebody ain't Dil or she will be cheating on you
In the club like oops looking to the left touching herself
She’s like fuck em girl fuck em in a fuck em dress and nothing under
There’s just something nasty when we come out freaks come out
Don’t get the wife mad enough to throw your beeper out
Or watch out for my beeper out or she will be cheating on you
If she creeping on you you see cheating on creeping on cheating on you
Cheating on you creeping on you is he is she creeping on cheating on you
Yeah creeping on you

[Outro]
Watch out for the creep
