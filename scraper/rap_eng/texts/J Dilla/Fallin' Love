(Intro)
Yeah
I guess it's time to roll anotha one
Helps me spit it out like some nasty flavored bubblegum
And I guess that i'm the troubled one
But you won't see me posted up with a couple guns
Still shootin' for the sky until i'm number one
Watch out motherfucker here the thunda come

(Verse)

Whaddup, i hope that you be doin good

Me i'm on the east side with the peace pipe in the Bruins hood

I've been studying taking notes like a student would

Reminiscing bout the good old days when we was movin' kush

You sucked the life out body like a pomegranate

2 months later i aimed for heads like target practice

Marks a savage, i thought of Janice and popped a zanex

No longer panic, i dropped the faggots, and offered bandwith

I'm off this planet cause this the place where the sharks inhabit

Stop and rap shit at the population just to cause some havok

Need me a blunt, a 40, a shorty rockin spandex

Talkin spanish in my ear im thinkin that i lost my balance

I bought some matches, i struck em all and watched em burn\

Mad props to new york, but im thinkin this be bostons turn

I toss n turn at night can't sleep because they oughtta learn

That i'm the motherfuckin' shit, so suck my fuckin' dick


(Chorus) x2

I remember getting mad at my parentals

Because the road was rugged so my faith was differential

Within a second felt my heart was disassembled

So please dont be forgetful, now shes only in my mental


(Verse 2)

Nod your fuckin' dead and appreciate the hip hop

This is grown man rap yet you fuckin sound like kidz bop

Variation, stoned bumping blitz krieg bop

But if you stick around i could teach ya how to pimp walk

Ha, ha, ha ha thinkin' you can touch us?

We start to swarm, then we bring the ruckus

Fuck blunts, i hit a vape and ladies fuck us

Hit it after she was dumped she got the swagger of some dutch guts

Yeah

Life is like a lunch truck

Goin place to place bringin flavor gettin fucked up

You fuckin suck punk and i don't like your attitude

Until i'm in a coffin up in boston i'm the baddest dude

(Chorus) x4

I remember getting mad at my parentals

Because the road was rugged so my faith was differential

Within a second felt my heart was disassembled

So please dont be forgetful, now shes only in my mental
