[Verse 1: Deondre Jones]
From New York to CT, yea they know what it be
Futuristic swag but flow like the 90's
So, Hut 1 hut 2 you better check my steez
Our game phat with a capitol P 
Presidential high grade, so thats capitol weed
All day I grind hard in them Nike sb's
While you on ya ass doing shit, R.I.P to my niggas, sip n reminisce
Who real as this, spitting flames, burn on some acrylic shit
Play this shit back, play it back till u feeling this
Came a long way from stealing candy like a misfit
Spitting audio crack, so listen for a quick fix
You already know who the best is, the freshest
Spark no necklace, smoke Ls like a lexus
Ass like texas, the bitch that im sexing
Listen close to get the message...
Uh, message sent, rolling on straight yall niggas is hell bent
I was at the bottom when little was helping
So when I get to the top I got little to help then
So yall can burn in the fire, Follow the fate of the fakes and living liars
As for the bitches, we spread en out like fliers
Roll with the crew, our society is gettin higher
I make it bam bam like the pliers
Been on a roll for years fucked the tires up
Leave these lames deceased
While we resurrect the game like Jesus piece
And these bitches boutta faint say they knees is weak
Pick em up with the haze, while I’m chiefing keef
No competition, I don’t seek defeat
Skated on hells ground, This is easy street

[Hook]x4
Eat a spoonful tell em all to eat they wheaties, tell em eat they wheaties, tell em tell em eat they wheaties

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]
Yo, they told me to go in
I'm writing with biggies ghost pen
Mastered my craft faster than Ryu with Gouken
I'm vomit spitting no MF DOOM
I'm tryna do it big like ten red shrooms
Surrounded by these lames can I get leg room
And put CT up on the map like Jim Calhoun
Uh, fuck the past, I'm the futures present I'm winning now
A rare breed, a pedigree no kin to bow
I begin to sprout photosynthesis when I get announced
They saying damn I ain't know he had it in em
Raps reduce you to a pile that just leave eyes no denim, nigga
They gon bump this in two thousand ninety nine
My holographic hieroglyph that I spit gon be rewind
But, right now, ima keep spitting
Like a nigga had a lisp with a cobra tongue I'm so gifted
Watch me shine like Sho Nuffs Glow punch all in an instance

[Hook]x4
Eat a spoonful tell em all to eat they wheaties, tell em eat they wheaties, tell em tell em eat they wheaties
