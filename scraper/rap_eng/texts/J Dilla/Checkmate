Checkmate crown me king this loaded fo' fo'
Will make you fold up like a yo-yo wrapped around a string
Buck 'til it spray there's pen in my knuckle that sway
That send trouble your way like NWA Ren coupled with Dre
The secret is out the sneak peak leaked
Now your speakers about to bust and just skeets skeets
Victory's mine sick with the rhymes should be a crime
Convicting me sentence it'd be a century's time
You're not worthy to tangle with me
You're not worthy to hang with a G
Just dangle and hang from a tree
The moment you feared and scared you know it
This poet pierce a mere opponent and split his dome up
From ear to ear for acting like he don't hear me clear
I'm untouchable as a hole in a chastity belt and sheer brazier

They all holler I'm ill over the beat
Don't get overly beat the way your forefather
Tore cottons from fields your forgot that the skills
Put heads in a headlock shot you dead from cockin'
And still lead shed with a red dot
Now these niggas eternally sleeping
I think they personally prefer to be breathing
Anyone versing me is certainly leaving
The Earth surfacing the surface sea in this region
Your dealing with the don a villain and a con artist
Find the heart these killings still my feelings isn't gone
Run in your place with wonderful grace
Don't get stomped in your face I'll make
Your lungs jump from your stomach and waist

Toast glasses for your host with the most classic flows
Of the coast you gasping like a ghost just 'rose
From a close casket eLZion the guy to keep ya eyes on
Until the day you die Satan fries in the skies gone
Want him it's over with don't walk towards me with
A chip on your shoulder you'll walk away with your shoulder chipped
I stole a whip already high and racing deadly combination
Like a itchy trigger finger with a load of clips
I put a rapper to sleep I'm the wolf harassing the sheep
Rolling grass with a glass full of drinks
My real life clash with the ink this ain't fiction
No I paint a picture that a flick would show Mean Chicks
Fiends sticks for blow addiction dough restriction
Rob your polo before popo roll in your jurisdiction
Part of a new bread sparking this toolie
You being wet like water on a garden that grew weed
It's my time to reign I blind the game when I shine
I ain't gotta combine these fine diamond chains
