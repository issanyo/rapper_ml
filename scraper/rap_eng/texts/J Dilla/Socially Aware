(Verse 1)
You can't crossover with that gap in the bridge
Less you bridging the gap, and stuff the black clip in the strap
18 with a Glock 36 at the back
6 niggas in a van with a mission to clap
Five-0, drive slow, evidence to the station
Then it's a wrap, that's a menacing situation
Imperative and abrasive, a lesson to be embraced with
Destined to be impatient, weapons, federal cases
Testament to complexion, and gang violence
Lane driving, welfare, vacate college
Relegated conscience, gain ends, sustain wallets
The vices in our blood come from the same virus:
Selfish intentions, wealth and oppression
The shift that you felt in your plexus
Onto the next shit, a scatterbrained anomaly
Doesn't matter since the fact is they behind the scenes
Controlling your thoughts, you a puppet to the government
Colt 45 heart, your luck is under punishment
In a corrupted nation, we trust
With senate snakes in the grass, they'll in lay the cut
Stop your circulation of blood, until you laying lifeless
Breathe easy, stay alive if you can take them vice grips
Under fire politics with Al Qaeda ISIS
Higher conscious diagnostics, outer layer heights tip
If today is the day, then take me away
If today is the day, then take me away
Never wait for the day where we lay in a grave
So if today is the day, please take me away
To a place where heaven is real
Not where niggas swift with the Smith-&-Wesson to kill
Take me away, to the place in the clouds
And keep my name in your mouth, stayed complacent and proud
Drowning in pride, so it's time to decide
If you'll put your violence aside, there's a mountain to climb
And a limp is a weak walk
Feelings'll seesaw, in a minute I'll reach y'all

(Bridge)
In a minute I'll reach y'all
In a minute I'll reach y'all
Somewhere over the breaks
Holding your weight down in a motionless state
