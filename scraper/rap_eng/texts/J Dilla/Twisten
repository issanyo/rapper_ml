Maybe I should love somebody
Maybe I should be the one
Maybe I should love somebody
Whose gonna be the one you love
Maybe I should be the one to love
Maybe I’m the one your thinkin of
Maybe I don’t wants be alone
Maybe I should be the one you love
Maybe I should love somebody
Cause I don’t wants be alone
Maybe I should love somebody
Cause I don’t want to let go
Maybe I should love somebody
Maybe I should be in love
May be I should love somebody
It hurts to be alone
If we could hold on
Maybe we can fall in love
Maybe we should love somebody
Am I the one you thinkin of
Maybe we should love somebody
Cause love has always been us
Maybe we should love somebody
Cause we are still Holden on
Because if we lovin’ each other
Beats bein alone
