[Verse 1: Ken Rebel]
Showin' my lyrical attributes and attitude
Shorty bad and new
Put her kitty to the gasket hoop
Down to in-cooperating, settlement is my statement
I ride the 7 6, with colonies on our pavement
Fuck with Kenny, I'll put a nigga in the ground
6 feet like dead crips, that's a blue clue bitch
I apologize for my profanity, this is my humanity
Quick to sit down, I piss them off but they not standing me
First and foremost, I get the most doughs, most hoes, collect my cash flow
It's the young Fidel Castro
And my ass flows come quick like cigarettes
Niggas tend to bitch, when they sipping on that bitterness
Vinegar in your veins, don't say my name in vain
I'm a god in these streets to the lord I protane
Soon to blow like propane and gas tanks and flames
Do they listen, do they listen, do they hear what I'm saying?
But check me

[Chorus: Emani (Ken Rebel)]
Kenny can I kick it with you? (Haha)
I want to be your boo, if you let me too
All I think about is just sexing you
(Yo little mama just chill cuz you talking a fool
Now what we do and what we does, you know, it stays in private
Killing that pussy daily, alliance but now we divided
And check me
Let me kick my second verse off like this)

[Verse 2]

Rocking gold yall around the go far
And if not far i get the closest to my destination
You niggas hesitating, procrastinating, visualizing
Deposit action negative sayings i hear what you saying
Who flyer than the rebel wardrobe is on space hip hop's engagement
I'm the lyrical placement test me or manifest me
Wait now pause ima rebel with a cause
Pissed of like no draws
Never been a bum ass my ass
Got class and class breaking glass just to show my rebel in trash Most rappers feel intimidated when i start spitting intimidating Interrogating word on cloths in collision
You niggas talking sweet but yall just looking for feelings
I feel ya yet my senses just just don't comply
Cause im tasting spelling hearing visualizing ya lies
You a faggot you like pieces with a chick in a guy nigga

[Hook x2]
