[Verse]
Token black in my group of friends
I'm the one that they chose to represent
Everybody with my pigment, it's my job to shape perception
I'm doing good so far, but I feel like raising some questions
Is "you're not like the others" supposed to be a compliment?
Am I supposed to abandon culture to prove my competence
To you? Am I supposed to put up with your intolerance?
Thought it was obvious that a token black friend is not a fix
To your lack of diversity, it's almost worse to me
That i'm inside your circle not naturally, but purposely
I'm the one who has to answer to if you're dabbing correctly
You can say 'nigga' around me, I can't even say 'Becky'
I realized something was wrong
When my name to my black friends became Uncle Tom
They say that I forgot what 'black' meant
What do I know? I'm just the token black friend


[Hook]
I'm just the token black friend
What do I know? I'm just the token black friend
Might as well give me some chains and an accent
My other friends say that I forgot what 'black' meant
