[Intro]
It's a blessing to be mentioned with the most
Take a second leave a message after the tone
My eyes wander I wonder it goes
Sometimes, I'll never know


[Verse 1: Ted Darko]
The world is never yours so grasp whatever you can
I can't test yah I'm tesla you Thomas Edison
When shit hits the fan
Clothes never make the man
Words, they'd never understand
Unless it's whipped up in a pan
But I'm sick, I need a check, up in advance
'Till I'm up in the vans doing tours in up France
Whose the man with the bigger plan?
But everything is already been done by someone who got no dividend
So why be different?
What's the point in painting a picture
To have someone tell you the picture is exactly what it isn't?
Fuck your settlement embellishment and niggas who you settle with
Nobody gonna rep you if you got nothing to represent
So I present, the one whose been alone and comfortable ever since
Never been to Rome but roaming ever since
Looking for a home, cause when home he's homeless
Fuck it, society product
Finally made momma proud now that I'm in college
But that don't mean shit cause when young you have no knowledge
Don't need to know 2+2 to take a shot news phonics
You believe it how ironic
Too hungry no choice but to eat whatthey feeding
We lost hope, so now you need something to believe in
No thinkers you to quick to ask for the meaning
Crazy how you only hear lines when yours receding
Always had the tendency to lose things
Hand me down shoes I'm wondering where the shoe strings
I had black boots with, metal lace loops
Just incase you, start to feel ungrateful
Too many associates it's hard to trust you
If I sleep now what the fuck I'd wake up to?
Conscious contradictions
Intuition or tuition? fruiting or fruition?
Rich by poor decisions
So ignorant to your existence
It's hard to understand
If you believe money defines your worth
You're the loneliest man
What hurts is the truth
And I am living proof
I make the songs you'd love to hear
But hate to listen to

[Hook: Ted Darko]
And that's real, Nigga That's real
But how can that pay the bills
So understand how that feels
X2

[Verse 2: Ted Darko]
Your fears are my reality, cops casually causing casualties
And you mad at me? For giving you pain and agony?
The fact is, you passively passing by the masses as they cry
As the taxes we pay get you by rise immaculately
In fact, the ones with nothing always tend to give back
We struggle while those who got it good kick back
Broke kid never paid attention to class
You're thought what they want
So if I ruled the world imagine that
Vigilant patient persistent
Through the wire a victim
Giving hope where missing
You choose not to listen
I look so ig'nant, but so damn inspired
One look at this Mac, set a Dell on fire
Cause hail in the summer
I swear by this affidavit I'm this slingshot you Goliath
Momma know that the kid sick, she held no get togethers
So I spit some sick shit in hopes the whole world get together
Lets spit some rich shit bet it'd make the poor more feel better
I spit that Pac shit and give the homeless may weather
Yall favorite rappers flowing like its slytherin only way Yall listen in
Be more attentive yogi looking exactly where the tent is and taking all the shots like its tetanus
Y'all better B ware, yah gon C blood, depending on what B wears
These niggas don't need no bitch they rather fuck themselves
And these hoes don't even bark when called bitch they don't give a fuck themselves
Guess that's just the life they living, they don't see that life is wisdom
And when they decide to pass it on, she grab the baton and got a burning sensation
Too much fire? Get the fuck out the kitchen
Not a problem riding dick, but no pride in washing your own dishes
Sometimes when you lose, you're a winner
Shit I kick is food for thought last name Decena
I'm 17 looking for a lil consignment, cause It's cold rhyming, But if you know he cold sign him

[Hook: Ted Darko]
And that's real
Nigga
That's real
I'm talking but can you hear?
Nah nigga, you don't care
And that's real
I ask is it fear?
They just tell me it's real
So deal
