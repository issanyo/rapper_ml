[Intro]
See, I know how they want it
They want it grizzly!
Yeeaaaaah!
Rrrrraaah!
Aaaaaaah!
Yeah, ay, where you headed?
Is it north? South? Uh

[Verse 1]
Y'all think Satan is bad, J Dilla bad like Jason I stab
Stay in the lab
Quick to tell bitches bout my motherfuckin' tim size, 8 and a half
See, they wonder how I'm makin' my math
Or why I be makin' my path to the place where they be shakin' they ass
Spend dough on a hoe, roll out in a Rov'
When it’s over, no Rov', hoe’s takin' a cab
Then they call me, sayin' they mad
And then call me, playin' with they pussy while they takin' they bath
Cause they know

[Hook]
Give em what they want (x8)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
It's the capital "D"
The "i" to the "l" "l"
The "a" to the bank and I’m ridin' it til 12
I’m straight with the cake so I buy what they sell
They see me blazin' the hay, be high as a stealth
Won't come in on the average radar
But will come in a bitch mouth if she wanna take it that far
She a gang star, J start breakin' they heart
Breakin' they backs, a gorilla pimp, taking they scratch
And I make them attach to the good thing straight from the back
Straight from the front, love to give J what he want
Known for shakin' they wrists, and makin' them sick
Then takin' they grip and payin' them wit it
Biotch!

[Hook]
Gimme what I want (x2)
Give em what they want (x7)
