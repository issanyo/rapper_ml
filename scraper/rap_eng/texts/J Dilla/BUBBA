Got that purple on me
Gonna go ahead and smoke some weed
That's all I need,follow me
I know I can take the lead
Baby please
Listen to me
This will be some good shit
I guarantee
Gonna smoke more than a eighth
That's nothing to me
Got that Bubba Kush,so I can blue dream
Up in the sky baby

[Hook]
Got that bubba kush so I can blue dream
It's up to you if you want to join me
I'll introduce you to my stress relief
Gonna smoke more than Chief Keef
This will probably be your new routine
Meet me up tomorrow at 10:17
We have so much to see baby
To see baby

[2nd verse]
Sativa in my head
Realizing things i'm starting to understand
I just want to go on about my day
Go away,I have nothing to explain
My high has come down and i'm cruising downtown
Stop by a liquor store and get some more..
Vegas game greens,burn slow
I'll stay high forever you already know

You already know
I'll stay high forever you already know
Gonna last forever like a damn photo
Make this song your favorite audio
Feeling like I'm on top of a rainbow
Well I got to go
See you.. tomorrow
Repeat the same routine all day for sure
All day for sure

[Got that bubba kush so I can blue dream
Its up to you if you want to join me] x2
