Purple

Im
Chiefing blunts of 50 getting head to tom and jerry
The smoke is blueberry always hairy keep it airy
Frankenstein scary and the amber red as cherry
All the weight i carry never sharie word to mary

Bust the capillary on any adversary
Win the primary and it's all monetary
Eat it like culinary get it customary and
To hell with that commentary that shit isn't necessary

Throw the hail mary when i'm aiming at my enemies i
Blast through your head like john f Kennedy my
Recipe for legacy is nothing less than destiny i
Am a divine entity ROCK to this melody

I spit it with no filter finger on the trigger
My heart gold but my soul bleed silver

It's a clear winner invade you during winter
Keep it gassed up like a camp run by hitler

It's a clear difference when rising up the rank

Keep it 100 like benjamin franklin

Planking in the tomb like an e-qiyption Im
Over the issue cancel my subscription

Never hear me bitching rock the headband
I'm a psycho for the  vault welcome to the  borderland

Oh man goddamn travel to the motherland

Sleight of hand and that profit sittin in my hand

I'm the fucking man and i keep the flow robotic

Sipping on wild turkey smoking the narcotic
