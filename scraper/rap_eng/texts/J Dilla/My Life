[Verse 1]
I was standing downtown, downtown
Staring at the puddles on the ground
Tryin' to figure out a way up out of this town
And I know yeah, I'm not the only one
So many people out there chase the sun

If you're looking for a free ride
You better run child
Or you sure won't get too far, oh
You'd better dance a dance
To make the rain come down
If you want to be a star, oh my life

[Hook]
My Life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I
Wanna to throw my hands up in the sky
Cause one day I know I'll be flyin' high
And I know yeah I got to get down
On my knees and pray
Cause in heart I know I'll see that day

When my freedom comes along
I'm gonna run child
Cause I know that I'll go far
Can't let nobody kill my soul and bring me down
And they know who they are, my life

[Hook]
My Life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

My Life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

[Outro]
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
No turning back
