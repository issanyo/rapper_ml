Lord
It is you that gives me chances to love
But sometimes I feel there's no one above
The artistic, autistic, raw sentence flow...
Embedded by scripts and mixes from a chemical
I look at life and just know that it is wrong..
For me to sit here and just straight go along
Be strong..as your word teaches man to be like you
When it's freakin' trigonometry for 0s with that decimal
I get upset when I'm in stuck in that mood
Going to clinics and they finish what I'm thinkin' it's good
Lord, when am I gonna pay them back?
When am I gonna get me a track?
I got scratched up investing in mine
Now it's time to intertwine where it is fine
No penalty fines, no shortcuts in this life line
Just a minute...you're reading my mind...


Lord, highly exalted, most praised and feared
By mythology where every smart man grew a beard
I am so grounded by the word of Jah
The word that RAH-RAH gets me so amped I overlook
A street demon
Schemin' when I can't build the wind
For them evil words to give them a send
There's no taking back, what I've done just to live
In a shack
There's no Luis Vuitton, it's no thing to be back
Why is my skin so wanted, now?
Why am I distracted distorted and everything that
Comes with this vowel?
