This one goin' out to, all these bitch niggas
Talk shit 'bout me, 'bout my clique
Talk about how much we bullshittin', knahmsayin
You gotta get yo' shit together, shit

You ain't got yo'self together and I'm bullshittin'
I got cash, you broke, still I'm bullshittin'
Listen, I could give a fuck about what
You do, and you do this, what
Is it, my man, you know that I don't play

[Sample]
"I don't (4x), I don't play
And if you take offense fuck it! Got to be that way, J.D."

[Loud whispers]
TIME (3x)
CHANGE (2x)

It escapes me; aw shit was so funny man
Was you what, what burn
That song uhh, the first song they ever came out with (hmm)
Umm, "Bullshit"
{*singing*} Can't cook up a good man
Pull up about, yeah, pull up
Nuh-uh, pull up a seed or some shit
Kickbacks?
