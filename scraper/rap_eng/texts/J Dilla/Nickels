I hum dilla. alhamdulillah
Rum spillin chum still villain
The coup de grace grinding up to
Cue the grin
Cess rest in my cuticles
Sliced it in the cut, square opened like a cubicle
You the fool pitied
The cool brew pull the culprit off that bullshit
Swear i'm good now
Used to jam my shit riding up and down ludlow
Always had the soul, i just had to put my foot down
Yeah we rn like radon
Thinkin bout the shit me and ray done for the hoes to raid on
Psssh pssh I'm buggin
Zip disk done suddenly zipped out
And that's to much of my family's chagrin
Stay out my dms with your edm
That pm dropped and they pms
When I see em with c-notes bet it's no rem on me no more
Add that ember boy i'll reload more
Whoopty doo
Get more scratch than ya hoopty do sunni? duly noted. if you wrote it, hope it's truly you

Im off the hook like the cordless, bitch

I ain't had a snap in how long?
Another measure to howl on and sharpen the talons so
Throw your towel on
Flow like the nile aww you're cheap nylon mouth like a firearm top i got my eye on like stannic ion grip on irony
Who you tryna be?
