You know...if you make moves some people will envy
Say what's (what's) up with this jealousy

[Hook]
You know people say shit, bout you and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (one more time ya'll)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (yes...yes...yes)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

[T3]
Yes ya'll (ya'll)
I love it when you hate
Now lets calculate, take it straight to straight
Take it, to your face or wherever you lay
Oh you say 'You fake' and won't talk shit to your face
See in the first place, you made a crucial mistake
My crew congregates just to aggravate
With plots to infiltrate and abbreviate
And if you think we out, shit we got rhythm for days
Take it to another phase, rip your ass off the stage
Havin' you feelin' the blaze of NWA's
And if they ask you 'Who you doin?' tell 'em 'that nigga Tres'
Yeah damn right I'm great, like the porno tapes
Endless pursuit of the ladies like collecting papes
To these jealous niggas let the jailor make
Your man ain't got time for the fake
To those fake niggas, need to put 'em away

[Baatin]
Spread the word, that nigga's hardcore
Envious Emcees' lyrics are cardboard
Rip 'em up, cause I'm the real Jack Ripper (Uh-huh)
I call him Jack Trippin' Over (Uh-huh)
Who call himself passin' over tryin to provoke
The High Priest got you in my step-era
Envious niggas I don't trust
Thought I didn't see when the act erupt
Dracula nigga step back cuz I'm the cross
I'm winnin this game, my mind true left in the frost
Check my mic when I bust it got tossed
Lost in the crowd, the jealous niggas wanna floss
I'm all in your face, grippin my nuts, nigga what, nigga what

Uh-huh what's up with this jealousy

[Hook]

[Jay Dee]
...Jealousy make you say what the f-...
This goes out to the niggas that's talking the shit
Same niggas that be dubbing tapes and walking and shit
No life-having like a nigga that's stalking a bitch
No joke, broke, ya'll niggas be cracking me up
Player hating, plotting, planning on jacking me up
Don't do it, you don't know these niggas is backing me up
Hardcore, fuck rap, clapping a gat nigga what
Hardcore, pimp smack em up and mackin 'em what
Good shit, like 55 in the back of the bus
Hot shit SV; your shit wack as a fuck
Don't get jealous cause the S is stacking 'em up
Say (what, what) say, you know

If you make moves some people will envy
Say what what's up with this jealousy
You know people say shit bout you and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

Uh-Huh
