[Intro:]



[Verse 1: JFKray]
I heard breathing keys but still made this happen
We raid the third world like aye aye captain
Metal plated hearts standing in a pastiche
That sleekly get away with a mile wide niche
Sheesh and made it big from a little boy
Then give Iran a soundtrack of their missile toys
Drop the bomb that shocked the would thrice and not bar consequence
Even the kings would be put in a sarcophagus
Then frame russia to blame for your duffer
The last face you see before death will be an usher
Loose and cold the test won't be long one two
Truth be told I'm just dropping bombs on you
Radioactive lethally spreading when I'm on
Breaking down MC's two seiverts i go it ain't wrong,  
Mk ultra's aged 50 years imagine it now
Vultures picking our brains til we fathom to bow
And go under 6 feet deep submerged in liquid
Falling in a tunnel the spirit's gifted
Watch the shapes go by for eternity
Until your mind fights to become it's own adversary
Our 3rd eye's puny in size with the wider
Only bump into me in a hadron collider
Explore the galaxy in agony or valancy
But the feds try and confine your fantasy stratergy
I create shit brighter than your grades are
The universe lighter combine with a quasar
As my thoughts get sucked to a black hole
To find dense fucked and dark to plant a flag pole
Then come back to spag bol
And get tossed aside on the mic like a ragdoll
Infinite expansion across the multiverse
To a place in a mansion with a lady and a bulky purse
Who rocks a clock on the right hand with diamonds
And cocks a Glock sinister pointing at owners of the islands
Got a shot right here
But fear of doom soon consumes her and she tears
Arms shake and tremble she wants to die last instead
She misses and the bullets fly past his head
Zooming through wormholes seeing it all
Viewing the same pictures and everyday fall
Discovering new waves to control the mind
Becoming new slaves that patrol behind
So find a way to break the speed of light
Cause dark might travel faster through fear at night
That's the way we get the memo
Not through positivity but death and escrow
I wonder will the lower class ever learn
To ponder if they see the truth that they better turn?
Imagine this from the POV of a solopsist
The brain at the bottom of a food chain whilst monarchist
25 crown and a dream  it seems
I find gold and sew up the game with my seed
To make food for thought till the day i get caught
And get thrown in jail for selling a plant that they bought
A pyramid that sees us the idea was genius
I got a fair O in my bank through jesus
So I thank the lord and keep my head down working for his plan
At minimum wage as his swords behead afghanistan
That's the day I ran back and figured out the truth
And this way i can slack but stay about the booth
If we knew what the feds did they say we'd lynch em
Isn't that convincin to end even those that hang with em
The government control the amount of crack sold
So they posses the souls and and all the black gold


[Verse 2: KenZin0]
Prepare yourself for a lyrical assassination
My intoxicating words leave you feelin wasted
Spit it so vivid, goddamnit, you can fuckin taste it
Raps like your facebook status, shit's complicated
Stop it. Cocky motherfuckers talkin nonsense
Just a cover up for skeletons up in their closets
Supply and demand simple economics
Go ahead and tell your man that I give your girl the product
Whats the business? Spitting game to bitches
Talk shit, get your skull split in an instant
Stitch you up quick with a shit load of stitches
Or finish up the hit leave you swimming with the fishes
Never been a friend of authority
Teachers try to ignore me
But I stick out like I’m horny 
With a boner fucking seniority
I don’t, think your in Kansas anymore Dorothy
I am the wizard metaphorically speaking
Of course, practicing lyrical sorcery
Hoping to get you off



[Verse 3: Donny Danko]
Faded memories are the mark of the beast
And the devil with a smile is the hardest to beat
Dishevelled from my trials, yeah I came from the back streets
Ironic how a white kid the rap game black sheep
Day tripper like Lennon and McCartney
Getting old, wondering what happened to the party
While I was flying high my wings burned like Icarus
Living with this pain, it's a token of my bitterness
I'm sure as shit I need a different approach
I smoke a spliff and burn my lip on the roach
I'm quick with a quote, rock star in the game now
If I don't do a Kurt Cobain and blow my brains out
I got it covered like the mask on MF Doom's face
I'm like no other when I'm spitting to the boom bass
To all those saying that they've seen my best days
You're joking, give me some beats and let's blaze


[Hook:]

[Verse 4: J. Bravo]
Bravo the wicked one, set it off quick
Every bar hit hard, tomb stone reads "RIP"
Super villain, I'll leave you hanging off a cliff
Then dip and dash, first secure the bag
I got your chick in the whip
Watch me swerve and laugh
Easily, showed me her tits for cash
Thought she was a college grad but she lacked the class
I pull up to the scene and watch em gasp
Got on a gazillion chains and a silver mask
J. Bravo! the man with the stellar past
Called me Helios in my last life
Get the shotty to the face if you don't act right
All the homies hell-raisers, call em Cenobites
Snack on weak MC's when its dinner time
Yall a lil dusty, wash em down with a Miller Lite
How i'm feeling like?
I'm on the road hell and its a long ride
When the guns get drawn, it gets graphic, Hentai
Bravo move with the strength of 10 guys
If it's about the guap, i don't play no games, Bandai
Namco, bullets got no name, pistol aimed at a John Doe
I'm hit a stain if you lame, what you got tho
I tote the 9,and move the weight like I'm Rondo
Never been a tonto, living like im narcos
Smash the chick and ghost, learn that from my uncle
Every since a zygote, villain in my blood
Sensei Doom, catch me chillin in the cut

[Verse 5: ThaHipHopHead]
I’m the Baron of my time, who wanna dare to defy then?
I’ll leave your life an error, like zero divided
Fear the herald of crime, streets rife with peril ‘cause I
Embarrass your highness, and take care of the wisest
And if you’re aiming for the moguls while a local yourself
I'ma poke you with the smokin’ heat, endanger yo' health
You sittin' at home, typing snide comments on your keyboard
While I’m climbing forever higher, and you fail to see, whore
Or player, I’m a slayer to wack MC’s, no danger is greater
Then ThaHipHopHead, y'all better be sayin' your prayers
Because I’m the verbal assassin, I’m aimin' for mayors
Put my name in your mouth, better wash it with soap, hater
Y'all are shit to me, y'all ain’t even spitting heat
And you can’t call it dissin' because hip-hop’s about competition
I’ve transcended, I’m omnipotent, omniscient
I kill Gods, and heathens, I was just born gifted

[Verse 6: BigBabyGOAT-116]

[Verse 7: gamemast15r]
I'm the Phantom of everything
The opera, menace, synths; hell I'm even stealing you're wedding rings
A regular pawn that pawns shit in the game of chess
Even the highest tier rappers will tell you that game's the best
Accept the facts or I’mma send you to Jesus of Nazareth
Fuck making drug money, my methods are making cash legit
I'm flexing like Peter Popoff getting that divine transfer
I'm powerful enough to kill you and have you die with no answer
God ain't gonna save you, no one can
And I'll make sure that you will never flow again
Bitch I bar hop all the time, I only got six more to go
I got drunk a shit ton, and I'mma do it some more
Booze on the floor, wake up, who's in your whore?
Me or the whole block? Will you withdraw?
Do I got AIDS? Maybe hell, I'm just movin' the salt
I'm still the illest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Verse 8: Almighty U-Sorcerer & (Gamemast15r)]
(I'm flexing like Peter Popoff getting that divine transfer)
All of y'all done passed the line like a linebacker
Sometimes I get so high, I done pissed off the flycatchers
Sean Connery, modern day Highlander
Does Almighty trust a cop? Only one right answer
I'mma go Sheryl Crowe and fight you like she fight cancer
The phantom, got a pocket full of marijuana seeds
The thing you are is phantom of the opera seats
I go and fuck a hoe but I don't ever bring flowers
In this Porsche 911, not talking the Twin Towers
Balling so hard, I make the legends look like dog shit
Scorpion Squad shit, sorcerer with the cauldron
I'll never be a racist, we all children of God
Wait for the next album, I called it *bleep*
I'm not the type of nigga to ever listen to broads
I already got the keys, why would I be picking a lock?

(Verse 9:Pgback)
Who am I? The braggadocious, atrocious, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Bemoan the free rap feat on the beat that’s, worth more than four Mona Lisa’s. The 6 Man, My power is raised like indices. Opponents roll onto the hall in dices, they exit sliced and dissect, that’s diced, or stung by fungi with lungs fighting Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis. I suppose you know this before you try to fight Moses, I am not Isis, I am Osiris. Yet a selective, selfish elf, setting trends and precedents, new gnome norms. I represent the friends of elephants. I navigate to the heavy-weights at heaven’s gates at a random date at 11:08. I’m done
