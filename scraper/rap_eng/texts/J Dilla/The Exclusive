[Verse 1: Rimeskeme]
Getting hand jobs from girls who can't handle a job
Or handle no liquor, oh god
Flow sicker cause I'm so odd
Like future
Fucking loser on a computer
I'm not what you're used to
I'm all about the music
Y'all fucking stupid
Call me a douche kid
Guess I'mma do it
Clean it out
This game's a bitch that I'm eating out
But she suck my dick tonight so we evened out
96 to infinity y'all can't even count

[Verse 2: Von]
Look, look, look
I come alive in the night
Try match my style but my style out of sight
They seem not to get it
Unleash the beast
Man your boys will regret it
Don't wanna see my bad side
I'm always up front
You in the back
Dead last guy
They say I'm well equipped
My life's like a movie
But I ain't even got a script
This that grade A music
Drop a few bars just to leave them looking foolish
Ruthless, I go hard on these tracks
I put my heart in, that's what all these niggas lack
Man these niggas wack
Why waste my time?
While I kill these raps
A lot on my mind
My mind is another planet, I need NASA
Unexplained flow, I'm ill, cancer
Prancer, I hop over these niggas
