Rain dancing all around the slain sadness
Quick to flip that bitch around and show her whose the baddest
It's the war torn savage who withstood behind the barracks
To enact where I inhabit like a rabbit to his carrots
So careless when I hold the mic. Embarrassed of the damn thing
I hide it like the cupcakes in my kitchen in the pantry
Can't afford to handle any other type of planning
Yo I can't sing but do it anyway cos it's enchanting
Knock down drag out type of situation raised
When there's no more ring and there's no more cage
Who is in the middle to bewilder those playing
It was me, that's who, now get the fuck out my way
Son A, way paver though he's rather obnoxious
Talks in first person when he spits about his progress
Lyrics hard to get like chicks picking out a prom dress
Concecpts honest. Every rap is like a bomb threat
Check the onset, my conquest critical
The hard rain that's gonna fall is all up to my windowsill
Who'da thought the Buddhist type would come to take on Winterfelt?
The good and bad have equaled out Maha-peace within myself
