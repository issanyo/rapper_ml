HOP OUT THE BUILDING AND THEM FEELINGS GETTIN' CAUGHT
LIKE THE WIND WASH THE THOUGHTS OFF A BOSS
PAUSE FOR THAT LOST BOY, LOST
CARVE 'GLYPHS JUST TO TEACH 'EM BOUT A MEMORY
LIKE, "REMEMBER WHEN THAT DUDE DROPPED A TREE ON MY HEAD?"
NOW IM PUTTING TREE LEAVES IN A PEACH JUST TO EASE UP MY HEAD
SPEAK EASY TO FEDS
PUT CHEESE ON MY BREAD
THEY PUT A LEASH ON PEACE, IT COMES OFF WHEN YOU DEAD, DAWG
SIPPING EGG NOG, GETTING HEAD NODS
THEN GETTING HEAD, SPECIAL DELIVERY IN THE BED, GOSH-WOW
HOLY, GUACAMOLE HEAD UP IN REHAB AGAIN
REMEMBER WHEN HE TOLD A YOUNG BLOOD TO EAT HIS GREENS?
THE FUCK YOU MEAN DAWG, "THE FUCK I MEAN?"
WE ALL MACHINES FED GREED UNTIL WE BLEED OUT
NOW HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL NOW?
PEEL OUT, IN MY GRAND DADDY'S CADDY WITH MY CUZZO
SMOKE A FATTY ON THE 1 0, FASHO, FASHI
PELICAN HIGH
KISS MY GIRL ON HER HAND, EYES PEARLS, I'M THE CARPENTER GUY
LOVE LOST CAUSE LOVE FOUND
BOUND 2, REAL LIFE SHIT, W E ARE WE
FOUNDATION OF THE NATION OF SELF
ORATION TO THE PATIENCE OF THE PATIENTS WHO'VE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING
I'M BLATANTLY STATING THAT MOTHERFUCKAS BLINDER THAN EVER
SO HOLD UP, IT'S JUST THE MOON THAT BE BENDING PERCEPTION

THIS VISIBLE LIGHT AIN'T THE ONLY THING WE SEEING TONIGHT
I THOUGHT WAY BACK WHEN THAT I COULD SEE THROUGH WALLS
BUT NOW I KNOW ONE THING IS, IS I COULD SEE THROUGH YA'LL

YO IT'S THAT TRI-ED EYED LIVIN'
