[Verse 1: Zion]
Pussy niggas wild, they always frontin'
Talkin shit, and they ain't never jump in
Smacking Bitches they ain't never touchin'
This pussy niggas softer than a muffin
Me I took a bitch and now I'm stuffin'
Dick so good and now she tryna cuff it
But that's some foosie shit that I ain't fuck with
When she looking for me all you niggas shut it

[Verse 2: Elom]
Nigga do the runnin' now they runnin (hey)
Wearin' my chain and now they stuntin'
Pushin' all my motherfucking buttons
One hit wonder, Joe Budden (Na, Na)
Fucking always gone, now we touchin'
Say I do it better 'cause we nuttin' (Ah yeah)
Swear to God, she be sluttin'
But she do it right, 'cause I keep cumming

[Chorus: Elom]
My exes, my nexes
My bitch is the bestest
Don't stress it, just let it
Just let me in
My exes, my nexes
My bitch is the bestest
Don't stress it, just let it in

[Verse 3: Edwin]
Chillin' at the top with all my niggas
Make these niggas fidget like a spinner
Tryna hold it down for the Eastside
Cuttin' all these niggas Master Splinter
Your bitch, yeah I know you wanna kiss her
How my dick taste, kinda bitter
When she come closer
I bend that hoe over
She tell me that she love me
When I'm chillin in her liver

[Verse 4: Nick]
I'm just tryna keep it all 100
Funny nigga look like Mr. Drumma
Two pump chump when you nuttin'
That's why your bitch is always over fuckin'
Pull up in the Rolls, now we cruisin'
All my niggas with me, never losing
Only backwoods in the face
Same thing I'm doing to the booty

[Chorus: Elom]
My exes, my nexes
My bitch is the bestest
Don't stress it, just let it
Just let me in
My exes, my nexes
My bitch is the bestest
Don't stress it, just let it in

[Outro: Elom]
Aye oh way
Aye oh way
Aye oh way
Aye oh way
