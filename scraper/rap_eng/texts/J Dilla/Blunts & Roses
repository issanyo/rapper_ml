(Verse 1: Robert Mavro)
Somewhere between heaven & hell is this place called earth
Where the killers & the murderers are birthed
& the innocent too, I watch my boy Clay billin the zoot
I'm sitting with a chick; wondering if she's hitting it too
Wondering if I could get a minute man I'm wishing for two
Wondering if the world still has any time for the truth
So I'm sitting confused as I watch the moon melt in the ocean
& they say watching me rap is real poetry in motion
Listen in and focus
If God had favourites then I'm spitting like the chosen
I wouldn't say I'm bread or water to the homeless
More like; weed to a fiend I'm the dopest
Parting wavey bars am I Moses?
Blessed by God fam I know this
No I don't carry any cross for the hopeless
I just bring Mary on the track for my stoners
My new notion: make sure you got it
Don't crown me with thorns or pay me any homage
If you're tryna place stigmata in my logic
Studio I'm on it, truthfully if I'm honest
Ken's the only barrer I'm rating when we're talking on these topics
We are pro's to your novice
& whilst you're clubbing hard, we are late night grinding chillin by the bars

(Verse 2: Ken MST)
Yo I'm chilled in the bar came late then left early
After this bird I swear I'm going cold turkey
3 puff pass all the answers are clear
In the party with my team I might disappear cos..
This Daft Punk gets lucky
Surrounded by these black and yellow honeys got me buzzin'
That's what happens when you play your cards right and stop the bluffin'
I'm the King of Hearts ask your other half if she loves me
& if she doesn't Ima move onto your cousin
Have you trippin' over hurdles from the game that I'm runnin'
Have her blushin' like the tip of my spliff, when we're smokin'
Trap me? nah you're swallowin' kids, cuz I soaked her
I'm out of ideas, freshers giving ideas
A grade brain fuck lectures come revise here
But I got no heart, cold nights developed cold rhymes
I caught feelings, threw 'em back I'd rather hold nines
Cos that's the code that we were taught
Stop sellin' class now my classes are in court
& I can still get you 1.8 for a score
Big fluffy bags got my youngers winning off their draws

(Verse 3: Robert Mavro & Ken MST)
& that's the truth so you know it's kinda peak fam
3.5s for a score from the weed man
Cos he's old school like Del Boy & those fools
I said he's old school like Del Boy & those fools!
Got a motive? Ring Mav; I will roll through (RM)
& I can never get spun on my own tune (KMST)
I quote Ken on that cos it's so true
Preaching like Malcolm X, feeling like Goku (RM)
So what you saying 'bout my saiyans? (KMST)
The lyricism we possess it's hard to get away with
Simpleness, entertaining simpletons (RM)
Simply enough I met a simple babe the other day
She only likes to chill, smoke weed and get laid (KMST)
Piffs got my eyes wonderin' if they were born lazy
JD on the River Thames I'm kinda wavey (RM)
Drowning in the Disaronno I'm kinda wavey (KMST)
