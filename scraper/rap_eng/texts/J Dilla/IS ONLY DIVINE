Hook:
Check the image we're on something greater
Used to play with neighbors eating Now and Laters
Now the boy growed up
And I'm feeling glowed up
And you know what
Life is on an elevator

Verse 1:
All right so boom
When I first got to this prep school
In Upstate New York
This young bol
I'll call him "Madrock"
He came up to me all stereotypy, like:
"Yo, you're the new kid here for basketball, right?"
I'm all like, all right you're trying to put me in a box
I'll do you one better
Hold these buckets
And all your curriculars
You got the wrong sport, numb nut
And now I'm about to body everything
What's up

(Hook)

Verse 2:
Or yo!
So I'm waiting at the bus stop
For one of the homies to pull up in the university shuttle
Campus police walk up to the kid real slow
Hand tight on the weapon
Crept up on me like a cat on a mouse
And dude was like:
"You ever been to juvie before?"
I'm mad quizzical with the facial response, like:
"Bruh, I go here."
And then he hit with the:
"Oh because we just got the call and you fit the description"
Yadda, yadda, yadda
I hope you described a brother super guavalish
With the dopeness freshidilla on tap

(Hook)

Verse 3:
So we're dead in the middle of class
And this brother goes:
"Yo if it wasn't for the love of Jesus in my heart
I would kill every last one of you mother-"
Woooooo!
Like, nah he actually said that!
We were like that's too real!

(Hook)

Verse 4:
But how we sitting in front of my mans' crib
In the whip
Catching up all crazy
Plotting on the Wendy's Frosty and the fries
I actually can't remember if it was the Wendy's Frosty and fries
Or if was the slurpees from 7-11
When - WOOP WOOP!
Them boys roll through like
"Get up off the property"
Like we ain't supposed to be there
That's all right though
It didn't ruin the Frosty and fries
Gotta love it

Outro:
Well listen, ladies and gentlemen
That is the conclusion of the Black Guava series
This has been Green Guava for your ears and your soul
I hope you enjoyed being here as much as I enjoyed having you
Shoutout to ZILLA, the mastermind
My name is JP Reynolds
Peace and Power to you
Goodnight!

Just trying to be a light in a world so dark
What's a brother to do?
They call themselves the alt-right
But we know that's just a farce
Undercover and smooth
