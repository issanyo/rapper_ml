And im about to reach the danger zone
The phone ring at 4 in the mon' as i groan
I pick up to see what up turns out my homie been shot up
Talkin smack around some goons never learn to shut the fuck up
My family saying buck up he was ya homie not ya blood
Thats apparent cause some crips shot em up just because
Outside of the liqour store surrogate buying ciroc and shit
Its really for my friends my sobreity fucked up and shit
Society fucked up and shit
Whole crew say drag a cig [i dont fucks with that]
I dont kno why i live by a code
Lyoko done crashed i should go with the flow
Look deep inside i should already kno
The dark versus light determine where i should go
One hand i wanna die and take a swig a patron
The other hand i have hope and wanna find my way home (x3)
