[Verse 1 MC Cprite]

I been rapping since a little pup
Niggas throwing thrash but they won’t pick their litter up
Now I’m feeling mad, that I even tried to talk to this man
To fucken literal, niggas ain’t about what they saying
I been writing a plan, I been sighting a grand
I been trying to make the cut like a knife in my hand
I been puffing a gram, shit got me all paranoid
Looking at this niggas like “what the fuck they staring for”
Better turn ya’ camera on, better turn to fox 5
Niggas ain’t eating but the chefing up them pot pies
Shit get greasy like Popeye’s
Even if I don’t have money, I know I got my guys
Rolling in a bucket, fuck it, we got to make it
Stay away from the swine don’t b placing with the bacon cuz
That’s the shit that tears the family apart
Even a turkey can fuck around a be with a narc

[Verse 2 MC Cprite]

Listen to Dilla like eating on some dinner
I hate telling these niggas, but I’m telling these niggas
I had failing these niggas, but I’m failing these niggas
Cause the lyrics supposed to come, but they never deliver, so
What my sentence is, to never rap again and shit
They reading all the essays but the only like the penmanship
Hating like they bringing it, knowing that they so ass
If you like my music say it, niggas got no class
Niggas say no fast, if you got no cash
That is the reason why, they ain’t got no fans
People hearing you, but that need that MC Cprite
Not mentioning me, can lose your life
I rap like I never had shit for my whole life
Probably cause I never had shit for my whole life
Everybody want to go and judge me on my old life
‘Cause they didn’t see that where the fuck would I go life

[Verse 3 MC Cprite]

No cash is in my pocket tell me how to stop it
Tell me why you knock it when I go to drop it
You wack because you chase the tracks just for the profit
I’m just a nigga that you said you couldn’t market
So tell me where your heart is, how you turned so heart less
You say you making songs, now tell me where the art is
You tell me where the chart is, tell me how to make it
I say that I will pass cause I can't be so basic
Now face it that I’m killing you, I’ll never give a verse to you
Fuck the check that you were dispersing too
Cause you ain’t got no soul
And this is what I’ll never lose
And you ain’t got no flow
And this one you will never use!
