[Verse 1:ForestPunk]
Eff the world, safe sex, latex, plastic
A magnum cocked for protection
When we blastin' shots and hold weapons
We birth infants with guns at the apex
So take steps my niggas and try to make death
Wait, telling you it's time when it ain't yet
Everyday stressed bullets in your face sweat
It's like your pores had to spray techs', get me?

Chorus:
The cloud's blot the sky, but we got to try
The earth is shakin' my niggas her...(body movin)
You can hold ya' clips but you better show ya' kids
The meaning of a polar shift (the body movin')

[Verse 2:ForestPunk]
Eff the world, you ate lately? her taste is great
We blaze daily, bass playing with 808s
Guerrilla robbery safe breaking your database
Wade in the water where slave babies was gator bait
That's information, like military ranks
Or sky maneuvers from them really scary planes

Chorus

[Verse 3:ForestPunk]
Space Monkey gotta save the era black
Guerrilla like donkey kong in a che guevara mask, what?
Just a bunch of mojo-jojo kids
Crazy trains of thought, locomotives
Ha ha ha, dance with the rebel's drugged laughter
So he's spacin' out like his head is from saturn
Hammers, anvil and metal gun masters
Break bread, hansel and gretel crumb snatchers
Mad youth, trash chutes and the fast food
Have you nutty for the money, get your cashews
Young Cinderella's walking in they glass shoes
Warrior princesses in your castles
Princes of crime, pullin' jack moves
Baboons rising like a bad moon, that's true
They say it's bullets or ballets what they asked too?
Rather cast a vote with a gun and blast you
