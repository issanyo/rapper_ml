[Verse 1]
Black fanatics, look like a pack of fags
If packing more than punches bad, then I'm
A drop atomic bombs, that shatter glass
Use a parapet to rap, like burritos
Quick, I need a bitch whiter than Orochimaru
Sorry, to put the mind on jagged, I just like
My prey, more pussy, than a cats kid
The one with the task, is no more
I'd rather let the world see the flow that I behold
On the floor boards, I'm bored, every beat stinks
I'll check out another beat tape, like a porn flick
Every rapper on the map, put em in a wasteland
Let the man in stance, enhances that he ain't a man
The amp pulls ya back, like a rubber band
The bass is another picture, but it's framed
To a mini man, don't see the whole thing
Bitches, and whores galore, chip on the shoulder
You need not to explain more, the outcome
Is insubordinate, it's horror, how he waits for the chorus
To make a mockery of it, dough is on the bakery counter
Ultimate bread it is, you know I'm not
About fucking shit like weird fetishes
Need a loop of controversy, like hula hoops
It's suited to the newest route, the money is not the problem
It's how ya solve it, revolve it, bottom of the barrel '
The bullet hit the target, some of these weirdo's
Need more of a girl that's sorta horny with a mind of loving
"My Little Pony, and fucking Barney", what's up with that?
You in a rat trap, you wanna rap trap, I trap ya
Till you can't never trap rap, oh wait, that's how it is now
Cash, and diamonds that are white and black like cows
I never been the one to be absurd, the salty
Niggas this season to the women, the pep her
Til she tired of guys being needy, goes on TV
To warn all the niggas, giving heebie jeebies
Understand like a midget in a courtroom
Why act stupid, sit down to the effect, like cartoons
The dick stand out, like a poet feather
Disgusting, like my squirrel food
The mouth like September weather
Tamed, must not of heard of my advantages, I wait
Stand silent, with the brain, known to mannequin
This been the big scare, Richy Rich, you know me there
This is been the pick to pair, bitch I'm a zillionare
