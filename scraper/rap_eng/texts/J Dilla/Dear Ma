[Verse: Amar Chong]
I still have dreams, whatever that means
Envision marble floor kitchens, living room flat screens
Just off rapping, I'm passing, livin' in the fast lane, no more fasting
And I'm still adding to account, my new account, got a huge amount
Tryna move you to a newer house
I knew about, what you doing as a stupid child
Then my brother started doing everything you knew about
Prolly moved an ounce, saw the loot and bounced
Maneuvered through the corners when the shooters out
I was a student, pursued a newer route
Now I'm spewing out, hocking loogies out, knocking losers out, never losin' what a rulers bout
Pullin' rugers out, nah, we'd rather show em what the moves about
What's the move about? Then we move about
I love home, but I think it's time I move about
7 miles away, so I moved up out
And now I'm living on my own two
Nothing's even close to what you showed me, not even if they cloned you
I love you mama, doesn't matter what we go through
I love you mama, tryna find a way to show you
Through these protools, I be a mogul, protocols to make nigga globle
The earth is in my hand and we're tonal
Connected by the spirit with the vocals
And I'm vocal, voting you for queen, my love for you's eternal
I approach you, to say I'm doing what I'm 'sposed to, I guess it's bout time that I show you
I approach you, to say I'm doing what I'm 'sposed to, I had to write this letter just to show you, I owe you
Dear Ma

And PS, in due time, the BS, a be gone, and we rest, relieve stress and be be (x2)
Dear Ma
