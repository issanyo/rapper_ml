Sometime ma' phone be ringing in the morning (mornin')
Sometimes I get it jiggy in the morning (I know)
Sometimes you could be winning and you forfeit (I know yh)
And you forfeit (I know)
And you forfeit (I know)
Sometimes she be willing when she wants it (wants it)
Sometimes she get it jiggy when she's on it (I know)
Sometimes you could feel it when she wants it (I know yh)
When she's on it (I know)
When she wants (I know)

Yh
In due time i'll be chilling in a cockpit
Auto-pilot on, writing rhymes
Hostess asking if it's tea or it's coffee
Yh, tea probably
Pass me some gin tho'
5 hours to Heathrow
All you can see is clouds straight out the window
What type of tea is this I wanted milo?
You should know I keep it real whenever I speak bro
It's how I live !
White lies sometimes not to hurt you
I believe encouragement is what I pursue
Some seem to like the feeling when they curve you
Bet you was hoping she'll tell you
You could come thru'
(I keep)
I keep it meek mill when I fall thru'
You gotta curfew?
I got one too
Yh I got one too
Uh, um
But I still take ma time to write lines all night long
All i'm on
Basically ma' all night fun
I deserve some accolades baby, amoshine on
You & your friends, you should know amoshine on

Sometimes, sometimes
When I rhyme, I just write
Everything that's on ma' mind
When they see you're nigerian they like 4-1-9
Omo we no even send them, fuck that right?!
Sometimes, sometimes
I like the calm vibes
Cus imma cool fellow, like the colour yellow
I'll be kinging like pharoah
Awon smellos, go right ahead and jump out the window
Check the lingo
AA.C.E we soon gonna blow, pronto
Picture us on tour
Get a couple thousand fans on floor
They cheering on us uncore
But  first i got to walk through the front door
Sometimes, sometimes
I just like to dance
Moves so hard, yeah am feeling like the man
Im willing to dance miss, even on demand
Come closer, i see you shine the brightest around
With that cute smile you like the finest around
Yeah yeah
Finest around, yeah yeah
