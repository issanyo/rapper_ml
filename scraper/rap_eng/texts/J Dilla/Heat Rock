[Verse 1: Cons3pt]
Might just be the realest rap I ever wrote
Might just be the realest rap u ever quote
My flow’s so water you gon’ need a boat
Bloody hands by the sink, never drop the soap
I’ll say we say, double on the three-way
God when I track slay, they gon play my replay
Solo dolo, knowledge what I know tho
Only tryna get the brass ring like Frodo
Now i’ma Hobbit, this work nobody can rob it
Goin’ after the green and you just tryna stop it
This is my soundwave, the speakers blast like a rocket
Eye in my mind, these haters tryna socket, (huh)
They only tryna add more profit to my prophecy
Pocket every plea success wouldn't pick my apostrophe
Looking forward from the back of every memory
Tell me you remember me, putting love over jealousy

[Hook]
I put my faith in this new rap
Yea, my heart beat with the boombap
Yea, you changed my ear for this hip hop
Haaaaaaa, every time you let the beat drop
(Yea yea, every time you let the beat drop
I’m relapsing all these addicts wit this heat rock) x2

[Verse 2: Cons3pt]
Might just be the realest rap I ever wrote
Might just be the realest rap you ever quote
I remember when my future I would never know
But nowadays I never really been so sho’
That i’m gonna get the dough
Make a millio a Show
Show you what you wouldn’t know
Punch lining every blow
Socially outcast in my past
Words stone cold thrown gave me a cast
I used to be a puppy who’s a pound
In a pound where live experimentation was around (uh)
The Dilla beats in my speaks really speak
Nujabes chop samples wit a samurai physique
I still hear what every beat is telling me
The heart drenched into every melody
A youngin wit a conceptual honor
Self esteem so high, he a’ trap you in a sauna

[Hook]

[Outro]
Welcome to the uh, to the Frame a’ Mind EP
