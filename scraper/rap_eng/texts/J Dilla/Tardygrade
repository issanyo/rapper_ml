[Verse 1]
Whether is from the top of the dome
Or the Sinclair sin type
Been surgically-brain separated
Put to sleep; As soon as you sleep at me
I dust niggas off. Bust a nut in the peace
Clear up my fucks;
Loose change is for the folding wings
On his saucer whip
You saw his martyr jabs with the quantum leaps
Perceive as thorny when overlooked with a doobie
It seems
Like someone should have said something sooner
But nah, they cheerfully greeted
The sentient;
Satin; but say his
An alien parasite; until he peels off with rights
Hello;
You won’t miss me until I’m listed, deported
In poor health
Have feelings; with no feelings
With a fist cause all I did was flick these lil bitches
So go to hell
Self-slaughter yourself with the
Fucking halo
Oh
How you doing? Pushing plugs
Crucified these Howdy Doody fucks
Flub a dub
Objective is to get out of this struggle dump

Who bout it? Flows somatic
With a spliff
The ugly spick: up in smoke
Show these spectators his quaggy spit
Niggas swear they dig us; his sweaty digits
You play me; assault his N64 for the maintenance
Is the man in airways, roads, railways, pile lines, canals
Is the menace
Verbal homicide
Not keeping shit to himself
Don’t got to tell me twice
Not in your life
Whatever the fight
See Ely slammed; oh come back
I’m awful when dejected
In some sense you knew me
Fuck it
Stress villain
Left trails for these fucks
Derange an unzip
A senescent fuck
She satisfied to see me
Not knowing his berserk
He wore and toured his adolescent already
