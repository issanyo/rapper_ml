[Verse 1]
Yo, she hadn't heard some real shit in a while
Walked over and kicked one of my fabolous styles
Rhyming on the corner had attracted a crowd
So we began to party right in front of the town hall
Come one, come around all
Gather all this knowledge that I'm kicking to astound y'all
Listen to the story of the government downfall
Their eyes open wide, this that shit that'll arous y'all
Oh nah, we've started uproar
They give no fuck less, we give no fuck more
Power to the people, we have started a world tour
Nation wide occupied, we started a world war
Ask your friends why they out in them clubs for
Alright, slay chilli on the table despite your
Freedom of speech, right to bear arms, and privacy
They jail us, cause these are the things we fight for
What the fuck is up, and what gives?
Soulful in the past had I not gotten in your ears
Now we have more trouble in the coming years
No price is too much, we have nothing to give
They push a hard line on drugs to save kids
Forgot about the peace, they'd love to rape the kids
Surival of the fittest, I'd love to take his
So nothing is out stopping the thieves from hitting licks
Another act passed to label us all criminals
And all we ever wanted to was just live
Police got to grant their stove from the post office
So the mail runs three times weekly in this bitch
Gripping school teachers laid off, no pay
Niggas was more concerned about the N-B-A
I've tried to tell my people about the N-D-A--A
Aye, mane, it get heavier every day
There's not too many words I could say
So all I want you to do is just pray, peep game
