(Samson):
Walk in Footlocker
The jaw dropper
Feet hot as Sriracha
Shadow box with Ali, I'm Ozzy
Black Sabbath born to stack cabbage
In vice city i pray for bad habits
My craft magic
My tactics for Macin'
Never been lackin'

(Killa):
Packin' with no place to go
We back in off the road we home
Took some time off now we know
No other place does it like

Mother Hubbard's Cupboard
On Eleven take cover
Seventeen in the summer
And I'm cruisin' with my brothers
Some of the others see my ice I'm a wonder
Wonder to behold when I'm struttin' all my colors

Sippin' on a Hi-C or freezy cold Icee
I see river rats floatin' on the high see
Mississippi sippi speed boat can't skip me
Second place behind me like I'm Jordan vs Pippen
Feel me
Feelin' myself when I'm out schemin'
Dreamin' bout breaking away from a life of feinin'
My demons comin' after me like I'm

(Samson):
Charlie Sheen or Chris Farley
So I'm not focused on finer things
You better find a dream
MLK didn't die for diamond teeth
I ain't rhymin' for loot
Stringin' words together
And definin' the truth
Tryna channel hip hops roots
Hypocrisy got me tweakin'
I won't respond to the beacon
Cuz iIm top of the sneakin'
They tryna stop what I'm speaking

Maybe I've been too real
Too sick but but my flu real
I'm sick of these rappers fake fans and execs
They dappin' you up and then it's straight at your neck

(Killa):
My neck look like a train wreck
And jewelry like a jewelers Mecca
Ca ching go my cash flow
Like givin' a goalie a gold handful
Or seventy six Rollies to Chasson Randle
Been on both sides of chasin' vandals
Break the internet like Genova scandals
(Samson: rip 'em Killa)
Before Jesus and Aladeen
Started rappin' for the C team
Samson and me
Six Four, Doc Coo, and Ri Ski Zi
Created the rap game currently rockin the QC

(Samson):
Cookin' these kids like Manchester by the Sea
Deez nuts won't freeze up like ice age
We ignite flames and invite lames
But we're too tight they can't fight fame
I'm the Kyle Lopez body building of the Mic game
(Peace)
