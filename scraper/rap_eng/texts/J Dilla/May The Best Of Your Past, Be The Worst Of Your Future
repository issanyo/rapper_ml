Im a bastard lately
Coz i've been drawing other chicks it's the life of an artist baby
Paint pictures dating women
Making enemies still I never let em take my energy
Yeah u remind me of time when I ain't wanna see my time end
To my white friends black lives matter
U see I walk what I talk I can back my chat up
Yeah man that was a side bar just a side note
Its just me and you girl we can lie low
On da drive home listening to erykah telling her boyfriend he should call tyrone
See im praying it dnt get like that
I pray u ain't exposing on the net like that
Uno I get busy sometimes so if I miss ur call uno that ima txt right back

Chorus:
It's been a minute, it's been a while
Since I've seen ur face but ain't seen u smile
Think of the good times yeah yeah
And we'll make it through bad times yeah yeah


I had a nightmare that I had a dream n i died before I got to live it
So i've been sleepin real late keeping real safe
Safe away from u plottin niggas
Coz really im da only man in my sisters life
She won't be a taz angel or a sister wife
I ain't picking fights but as long as im alive
Ima make sure that she okay and she right
I remember when uncle mike told u that ur dad died and u started to cry
Prior to that I ain't shed a tear but at that moment I felt ur pain like a brother should
Wish ur mother could see im a misunderstood coz all now I ain't bunning kush
I ain't running buj I ain't ducking fed even with my past sins that were fucking dread
This is for my nephews I ain't seen yet
For my nieces I ain't treat yet
I'll go broke tryna buy u world
And if I could i'll buy it twice
Just to show u I love you for life

Chorus:
It's been a minute, it's been a while
Since I've seen ur face but ain't seen u smile
I know it gets hard sometimes I know
But till da day that I die im always around
