Dealt the hand of homelessness not too long ago
Money was coming in too slow
Not enough for rent, had to spend it on food
And try to tough it out and hope we made it out
Moved in at my grandmother's workplace
Living out of a car, used her boss's desk for rest
I couldn’t rest, she told me that satan issued a test
Whether we pass or not, the heavenly love remain
If we make it through then our efforts not in vain
Keep moving forward like blood in our veins
Time passed and money flocked its way to us
Happy for the little bit god gave us
Angry for the bullshit Satan made for us
Miraculous sight of finally getting out
Affording luxury of eating about restaurants and cinemas
Once in a while
Later feeling aftershocks of the crash living in a pile of debt
My grandmother hasn't wept under all of the stress
But i see it in her face, deep in her eyes her true feelings
She tells me get educated to prevent this from happening
A melancholy voice that is half a century old
A young mind that doesn't listen to what he's told
Makes a lesson in teaching not easy to understand
Just hope he withstand the dangers of man
Tells me there's times when you feel trashy
When it seems like you won’t make it from poverty
But have faith in your virtues, your bones won't break
Life may hurt you, but your mind will heal the scrapes
Mind over matter, she believe it’s a way to make pockets fatter
I can die within an instant, why does it matter?
Living on borrowed time, till ascension or decent on the ladder
Sorrowed mind, fulfill mission and tribute it to absent mother
From a man to another, I pray for you my brother
Living the way you living, if you wanna live duck for cover
