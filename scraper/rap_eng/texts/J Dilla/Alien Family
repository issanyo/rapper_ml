[Intro]
Nah, but I really appreciate y'all being here because...
I already knocked up two, this is my third song
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: Donnie Trumpet]
I'm a fucking fire breathing dragon
The vocal trumpet assassin, like Charles Manson
Third-rail hopin', revolution, aggressive madness
Moving eardrums to wherever I place the beat
Lay back and kick your feet
Get it rockin'
Only got a fraction of time, let's get it popin'
I'm b-boppin', you bitch mate
I'm flip-floppin', you can't decide, you're always denied
How long it takes to realize that
Words next to one another form chords
And frequencies is me, is we
So let's make it worth it
Let's make it perfect
Let's make it like you never made it
I-I got--I got to have it, I got to have it
Poetry is more than a habit, it's habitual
It's my habitat, my ratatat
Makes my bones rattle, crack-a-lack
As a matter of fact, all that matters is fact
So here's a couple for your taste buds to wrap around
To rap about
I snap, crackle, and pop
Used to break too
Try to sneak a few moves where there's no space to
But that's what this thing is all about
Get in where you don't fit in
That's something I learned from my kin, my kind
The kids with no cribs, no fibs
I'm the one with all the dibs, and dabs, and don'ts
The rips, the abs, and throat, that's all I got
"Lovin'" as they say
All I really want is my music
And any other intricacies of life can take backseats
Sit in boosters, and I'll stay boosted
All you chicken shits can stay roostin'
I'm roastin', toastin' us and all that we could be
Always the first breath, the last is K.T.D

[Trumpet Outro]
