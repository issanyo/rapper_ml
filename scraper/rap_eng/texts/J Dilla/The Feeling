(Let me tell you) Bout the feeling
Let me tell you bout the feeling that I get inside
Let me tell you bout the feeling that I get inside (Scratches)
Let me tell you bout the feeling that I get inside
That I get inside
Yeah

[Verse]
Phase 1, look at all that you've become
Someone that didn't look my way for some time
Know I'm all about these rhymes, kickin verbs and nouns
I'm profound by the way the you adore that crown
I paint a pretty vivid picture deep within my lines
Behold the scriptures that I've written, no fictitious times
Are pretty rough, huh
Said I can't get enough of your lovin, an abundance of subjects as deep as covens
Could it be ever redundant if we ever get to fussin?
Probably not, our mentalities are similar, the thought of gettin rid of ya's
Not even in my mind
It's pretty hard to find another that'll understand the cover that I set
And accept that I'm nothing like these brothers
Yeah
You ain't ever gon' regret me, especially if you don't test me
So please don't tempt me
Yeah, Please don't test me


[Hook]
Let me tell you bout the feelin that I get insid
If you as serious as me, I'll put aside my pride
I know we got history in the making
Don't break it, it's just love phases so please hold your placement [x2]
So please hold your placement
So please hold your placement
It's just some love phases
It's just what love faces


[Verse 2]
Phase 2, Let me tell you what I wanna do
Never let these other women try to phase you
They try to erase you by tryna replace you
But I never let em get that choice to make
You one of a kind
The last of a dyin breed
You held in high esteem and I love it when the high is steamed
I don't even smoke but I supply it cuz you do
I roll a proper L, might even light it up for you
I know about a place to get away, you feelin blue?
Me too, I'm empathetic, so don't sweat if you think I don't really understand
Said I'm tryna be your mans
Got lost in the plan cuz I took you by the hand


[Hook]
Let me tell you bout the feelin that I get inside
If you as serious as me, I'll put aside my pride
I know we got history in the making
Don't break it, it's just love phases so please hold your placement [x2]
So please hold your placement
So please hold your placement
It's just some love phases
It's just what love faces


[Refrain 1:]
I know that you like the attention
And these niggas give you what you like
See I'm hardheaded more than one way
But I could promise I'll do you right


[Verse 3]
Phase 3, I know that these niggas thinking they will
But I could be the love guru wit mass appeal
While I'm pealin back all the layers of your apparel
I could see it more clear, girl your heart is pure [x2]


[Hook]
Let me tell you bout the feelin that I get inside
If you as serious as me, I'll put aside my pride
I know we got history in the making
Don't break it, it's just love phases so please hold your placement [x2]
So please hold your placement
So please hold your placement
It's just some love phases
It's just what love faces

(Let me t-tell you)

Let me tell bout the feeling that I
That I get inside
