As a child, I wanted so desperately to grow up. Now as a grown man, all I wanna be is your baby

Nineteen Ninety Four:
I'm so into you or at least I'd like to be
Ur a spice to me i'll book the tickets catch a flight with me
Coz ima treat u like dessert lifting up ur skirt
Call my fingers magic everytime I make u squirt
All this maxi dressing got this papi stressing
Bruddas know not to look I got a mac 11
But I ain't into waving a strap
Im just tryna love you while some dilla plays in the back


Just Ori:
I was that spoon

To me you were the season

The month is June

There's waiters they're on every beat, they table dancers

No belly dancers, staff don't take no chances

This is a prim and proper restruruant

And you

A primed proper princess so you parents would sooner see a fork in hell that see you eat rice with me

And I was too big to stir your sugar whites and tea

But I was so silver in my shine, I reflected your curves

Inner workings of your mind

We had no ordervs

We got straight to minding time

Mr glass half full meets Ms glass half empty

The optimist and the pessimist

Don't opt for miss be my wife, we can peck and kiss, x and o, x and o

If we put our cups together we could not eat and still be full

Even if we went china shop to cop some crocks id still be bull

Even if we were both north and I had no yang I'd still be pull

Then go on to break everything in there yet be your wool

Soft and gentle

I just wanna be the only spoon to be with you~

I would break this world, of forks, of waiters and table manners

To be the only utensil for your lentils

The sentiment's mental
