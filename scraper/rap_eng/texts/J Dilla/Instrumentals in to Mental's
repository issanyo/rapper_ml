Nothing is as it seems, in a dream living the feeling
Oceanfront waves of sound drowning in thought
7am snoozing, put the truth in it's ruthless
And then the sky becomes the limit, gotta go beyond it
Lunar bounce brah its rhythm, rapping like I'm speaking to my children
They hear me through the system, Timeless
Rhymes just remind us that life is timing, dont be mindless
I try to mind less about the government and the system
Living my life like a blunt and its hitting and Im facing
Submarine Operations probably won't be played on your stations but Im chilling
Really plottin, No ducks in my pond, and as life's hitting
The end gets closer in distance, dang
Window panes don't feel my pain theres rain on my brain
Let the thoughts on my brainwash, brain storm
Hurricane Sandy, F a norm I was born with Free Will
So I do how I feel, but don't get reckless
Why you feel this way? Deep reflection
What's your motivation? Why do you respect it?
Is your val(u)e like a necklace, impressive
Yeah you got a necklace but where's you head at?
Dont try to dead that you understand that, yeah

My issues in to mental's
Made Instrumentals to mold my mental's
Now, It's my instrumentals in to mental's
Got the Foundation, #SubmarineOperations

Take it back to Dream State, adderall and the vape
Plus I just found out about a 3rd eye, The words I spit
Are real life experience, best teacher, dont judge my lessons
Lessons cause of stressing, stressing over blessings
Blessings create progression, Im building
I'm chilling, resting, Still writing Walking, Take the Steps
And I feel lost in a vault of my thoughts, safety off
Pull the trigger, it wasn't loaded, notice
It's no easy escape, keep track of what you make
Music brah Im a user, dope feind user
Use it beyond my amusement, confused in it
They confused it, rapping what Im doing
Hopes of improving, still afraid to walk blind
