(Im Alex Ruffin, Yall Ready, Uh)

[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

Yo, a young god this ain't no caillou rap shit
I death roll spazz when I drag through the pad with black bics
All I did was grab when they told me thats how to capture
These dreams that just come up, I rap with a ton of
Conviction in my voice it was childs play now I son em
Im mad ill with it, mad skill with it
They say the feel my rhymes like when Monica felt Clinton
Tried to tell these hating fools you dont like it then deal with it
Now if I say im rollin im just moving forward
Now they run like a mothafucka moving toward
Im proving more while they losing more
Now I seek a bad one like Drew Sidora
A diamond in the rough I was used to the floor
Now I guess im real hot like im used to the core
They say im off the chain like Luke Cage belt
Well ima leave a mark on the game like my Kool Aid fell

(Yeah, Jones, Yeah, Jones I'm boutta get it)

[Verse 2: Deondre Jones]

Im shootin' for the moon no missin'
Rob for my 3rd strike some was callin' it Griffen
Knocked in the lime light, some was thinking he's ignant
But I come from a hard life, I'm just seeing it different
At the seams of the beat that Im ripping
Lyrical homicide someone call the commissioner
Lifted up off the trees, I break em down like timber
They calling for the Gods, they lift us up like Simba
Simba, better remember I stay DJ in this cole world like winter
While yall niggas change ya face up, To get a fake buck
I live my life in the stars, chillen on mars, 3 Gods golden like King Tut
But yous a puppet fuck it do ya thing bruh
Follow the airwaves and sing bruh
You Badass with a ring bruh?
But its whatever, spitting apocalyptic couldn't live in my weather
They say whether, to keep going or quit, never
Not part of the agenda, Im too clever To ever fall to these niggas
Throwing out shots, I'm finnna ball on these niggas
Forever hungry and Im starving for dinner
Swim up in that water Im like Jaws when ya enter, nigga
