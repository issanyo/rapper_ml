Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend
What’s your brand grab this money with Manute Bol’s wingspan
Thousand wristbands on the hand we touring in France
Take a glance I’m a rare breed in the flesh
Pharaoh indeed even the air I’m breathing is blessed
Take a wif from my alias you know the bars is a-list
Ageless I drop it’s automatic on the playlist
Half these artists probably jaded by the business boy stop
Weak minds I boycott, Jada Pinkett
I’m thinking I should change my name to who that spitting
Cause every time they hear the kid they ask “who that spitting?”
Po stay sober for nothing getting this dough beloved
They associating me with sick that’s Robitussin
I rap for social Justice and other shit
I used to borrow from government money my mother gets
I’m rugged and lit dodging plain coats cause my slang coke
Same flow as Hussain Bolt Po is running shit
Main question is “why am I here?”
Appreciate you cooking but I don’t eat swine my dear
Lately what I’ve been hearing been frying my ears
Trynna convince me that it’s dope just grinding my gears
I ain’t even try in three years going against me
The chance of winning’s thin like Japanese Tears
All you’ll find is agony here bullshit aside
They should nominate this mixtape for album of the year

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend x 2
Po Pharaoh Poetic the total package
Load the clip inside my metaphor cannon
I left the bomb site with no damage
That’s more shells for my metaphor cannon




Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend
Mega Mugabi with weapon’s that’ll shred a posse
Melanate your body when I inundate your lobby
Alienate anybody who don’t carry their weight
And keep the narcoleps very awake
Play no games cocaine lines that save lives
I’m A.I. too many men made money from great lies
C’est la vie used to drink with Fake IDs
Nowadays everyone a star blame IG
Standing at the top of a pyramid
Don’t worry about if I call you a bitch that’s a term of endearment
I came to shake up your career a bit
And when you see that NDL bandwagon come stay clear of it
Expertise this ain’t a verse it’s a murder scene
Show you have to go gainst the current still see currency
All terrain trained killer 12 gauge peeler
I found the recipe rest in peace J Dilla

Chorus: Napoleon Da Legend x 2
