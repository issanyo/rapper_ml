There are times.. when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me



(Verse) G5 Elz

I never knew a love love love
A love like this
October 28th was born my older sis
Danielle sis I call her my twin
Ms. Parker relationship
We been through thick and thin
Bunk beds , we were pissing in
Sneaking out and in
Get caught get more whips than Michigan
Hand over our ears
We wasn't listening
Everyday beef we was getting in
Every block switching friends
If we wasn't fitting in
We had to get it in
Til we realized we don't need friends
I'm all you got you all I got
Since holes in our socks
Parking whips on the block
Go to school to be a Doc
Just wished you cooked and mopped
But you bout to have a seed
So our roots getting deeper
Even if my branch fall first
I'll always be my sister keeper
Danielle,Lauren,Larissa and Maliyah
My fine divas R.I.P Angie wish I can see ya
