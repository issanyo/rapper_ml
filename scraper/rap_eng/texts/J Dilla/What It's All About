[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
First class
Full blast
Smash
Everything, women wiggle they ass
All my niggas analyze the color contrast
Live parallel, bound, shake control that ass
Hocus pocus, focus
Smoke this watch Busta Rhymes the dopest
Hit y'all niggas with the bomb diagnosis
Slum Village hot shit and you know this
Now at dates we talk funny and floss money
Jiffy shot that whip down when the day's sunny
Busta Rhymes and Slum Village will make a pilgrimage
From Detroit all the way back to the Brooklyn Bridge
Black bats and axe the crime rhyme spit in my max
Spinning my wax
I'm feeling one time
Blow your mind, shine, blind all y'all at the same time
Regulate chickens I always come and take mine

[Hook 1] (x2)
(Doin')
What it's all about
(Stop)
What it's all about

[Jay-Dee]

Superfly why try

Stay in the mix like Papadopolis

[Hook 2]
Busta Rhymes: To My Nigga Jay-Dee
What it all about
(Stop)
What it's all about
(Doin')
What it's all about
(Stop)
What it's all about
(Doin')
What it's all about

[T3]
Yo
Live on wax
With the extra raps
See the S been doin' this shit since way back
Say that, when it comes to rap
We got a knack for that
And for that we brag
Also we rap so this loot could stack
Grippin the phat Caddilac
With the diamond back
If you was to ask me where it's at
Said it's all about the cheese and these SV cats
On the real
The real Detroit rap
Player haters get the actual finesse it lacks
See, the words you speak can get you caught in a trap
Don't write your own raps, somebody else do that
That's word up

Hook 1 (x2)

[Baatin]
East mac nicholas snakes don't give a fuck
Frank Nitti got no pity on these niggas for what
My nigga Dane working up the game he from Earth
Show these niggas how you get your money's worth
I'm movin' in position with my mutual fund
I take it out in seconds and you don't know its done
I'm every MC plus 3 plus 1
All around the world giving suckers the runs
Call me Bismol with the Pepto shit
I guess that you could say that we're the ultimate
Flipmode Squad and the Slum's the shit
Come on everybody let me see you get down
Come on everybody, Motown

Hook 1 (x2)

[Busta Rhymes: Outro]
...Makin' you bounce
My niggas Slum Village makin' you bounce
Busta Rhymes y'all makin' you bounce
It's Flipmode squad baby makin' you bounce
Niggas in the world, makin you bounce
All my Bitches in the world you know we're makin' you bounce
Yo, yo
Yo we makin' you bounce
Just shake your little ass girl makin you bounce
