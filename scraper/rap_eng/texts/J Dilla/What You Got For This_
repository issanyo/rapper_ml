[Verse 1 - Noveliss]
Enter Zaofu, can't stay long
Fuck your gun play I'm bending metal like the Beifongs
Suyin, no days off, call the union, stay alive
Until the planets align and use your mind, and re-emerge
On Harmonic Convergence and drop the verbiage
Red Lotus, living un-tethered above the surface
Create until the wheels fall off I'm working tireless
Still keep a notebook so I don't get lost in the wireless
The abominable, championship belts around the abdominal
The prodigal mic check when "styles clash" I get phenomenal
My optical, see the design of these obstacles
That's why I run astray to get paid, my philosophical
I'm out ya galaxy regardless of what they telling ya
Interstellar drop a smoke bomb you see the Nebula
Dropping flash bangs in my path to cloud ya retinas
Break in the lab where they cloning these rappers destroy the replicas

[Hook]
What You Got For This?
(Shit I Don't Know)
Ay What You Got For This?
(Shit Lemme See)
Ay What You Got For This?
Ayo Nov What You Got For This?
(Ayo)
Ay What You Got For This?

[Verse 2 - Noveliss]
One time for my writing professors who passed the master
And the pen still mightier than the sword, I slay the dragon
The Pagemaster, keep my notebook hidden from the internet
Every poems the Epic of Gilgamesh, my intellect
Distinct Killer Instinct, I see you later fool
Microphone cyclone keep it spinning like Sabrewulf
Navigated the search well to find Earth Realm
I came for Mortal Kombat, premeditated casualties my rhyme pad will
Trigger a bomb if I read these lines back, fatalities
When the mics on they call me Bi-Han
Elder Sub-Zero no jewelry keep the ice on
And even when my eyes gone, I use my mind like Kenshi to get my slice on
Let bygones be bygones crush mics with a Angel Arm straight from Trigun...
