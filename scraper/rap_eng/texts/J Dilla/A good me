Can u take a little time to listen
To my rhymes
I can rap
And yall know im not lyn
This is my first time rappin
So gimmee a chance
Ima a rapper
And i dont sagg my pants
I ball hard like James
I dont do drugs cuz they lame
I sit this book on my lap
While im writing these raps
Im just a skinny kid from Uptown
And im almost to the top now
At least i didn't grow up robbin stores
And sleeping on floors
Life is the most precious thing that you can have in ur life
Not a gun or a knife
Why im still rappin
Its over now
Wait i forgot
I didn't grow up in a dog pound
