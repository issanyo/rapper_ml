[Verse 1: Price]
I'm lost tryna find life, supposed to follow behind Christ
But at night be texting old girl to see what that behind like
Been in my word lately tryna spend my time right
But stressed out smoking herb tryna get my mind right
Am I a hypocrite or real enough to admit the shit?
Am I a hypocrite or real enough to admit the shit? (nigga)
If you don't know nothing bout price know I'm sucka-proof
Yeah I'm number one but gon' forever push the number two
My daddy had the glass house and he had on colors too
And I was in the back, my head was bobbing with a cup of juice
Got a little older playing pogs, I was scuffing shoes
Then I started hooping, ya boy was getting buckets too
In middle school, me and Ju was the trouble two
Clipse grindin' or Dipset what we was crumpin' to
Dre, Kanye, OutKast we was bumpin' to
And all them slow Pretty Ricky songs we was humpin' to
Robert Kelly Grind bumpin' to, then I started trouble oooh
High school, I always used to disrespect the substitute
Now I'm in the office Mama mad cause she coming through
I'm in that bitch talkin' back like I do what I wanna do
She smackin me across the head like boy what type of son are you?
Matter fact go pack your bags i had enough of you
(Get the fuck out my house!), fuck it cool
I hit 2nd street where all the homies tucking 2's
They hit the alley and duck and shoot, might fuck around and then bucket you
Raised around guns but quick to show you how them knuckles do
I swear this shit ain't nothin' cool, so I tried to get away
And fell in love with you
Music my getaway, I hope I'm cuttin' through
Cause I realize, dealin' with women is like dealin' with goodwill
It ain't nothing new, I'm fucking through

[Hook: Preston Harris]
Moving so fast now we are
Nearly at the edge bout to jump
Out and, and take flight off in the sky
Over the lights, all like its time
We pay dues, now we got
Nothin' but straight grooves for you
And it just don't stop

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Look, I do it with passion or not at all, and tell my girl you keep trippin' you'll probably fall
I hate Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr's cool, still check them, think I'm addicted to all of y'all
Sitting here, phone in my hand more than stuck, I don't even know if I like it or just bored as fuck
Speaking of stuck i hated weed, and anyone that smoked it, 'til I toked it, passed to a beautiful bi--, woman, fuck
Sorry I'm high, what it's gon' be like when we make it, I text my girl 'I'm at the studio send me nakeds'
And you know right after the shower she gon' snap for me, just because I stand up and all these people clap for me
At parties niggas mad because they girl wanna dance with me, but never out of pocket cause they probably wanna rap for me
Remember long nights, with me Price, and Lil Anthony, and that shit feel like yesterday, I had a crazy past two weeks
Niggas know my people, you know my family, you know my squad, them niggas rap good as fuck man I know it's hard
And by them niggas I mean Hit Boy Price and I, are the reason the city is finally certified
You niggas hatin is gon' be hypocrites or real enough to admit the shit?, choose quickly
Is you niggas gon' be hypocrites or real enough to admit the shit?
I don't know why niggas fronted a while back, like we ain't shit nigga, or why LA women fall in love with these ain't-shit-niggas
Or why these ain't-shit-niggas always come 'round lying, well, I mean, I guess mistakes is proof that you tryin'
These Brandy 'wanna be down' ass niggas that fronted, see us now with everything that they wanted, but oh no
I need them fake handshakes, I need them 'nigga keep killins', I need them texts at 3am for the thrillin'
I need good weed that feel like penicillin
I need, better music like Dilla that got this feelin'
And if you can't supply that, then you can't supply crack, which means drug dealers no longer need you, we've got so far to go

[Hook]
Moving so fast now we are, nearly at the edge bout to jump
Out and, and take flight, Off in the sky, Over the lights, all like its time
We pay dues, Now we got, nothin' but straight grooves for you
And it just don't stop
