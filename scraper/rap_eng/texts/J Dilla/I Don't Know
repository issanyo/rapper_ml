It's, Amazing how shit goes down in this small town
Don't get buck, clown, before you meet the fucking ground
I'm lucky now, cuz you struck a frown
Feel your pride go up but you still suck, sucka, suck it down
Sluts be giving out, sleeping 'round, asking for that "Peace Of Sound"
But herpies spread like rumors, spread it, you can keep it now
Fiends be tweaking out, but I beat the odds, Never dropped a bomb but I'll terrorize your squad
Never got an A, But I'll school you like the pawn you are, pawning bars off for fame from the falling stars
You just a bitch, fiending off the rich, thought you had a purpose 'til I seen you go snitch
Just admit, plead the fifth, you don't wanna see me pissed
Not a diss, I can tell you're faggots by who you kiss
Ass, All I hear in the masses, Y'all been skipping classes, learn up and pass this
You ruined the mic like the skin on jackson, so don't black out when I'm rapping
Napping, didn't listen now you lacking, slacking, but asking, what's a classic? Spit aggressive act passive?
It's common sense, Dime's never buy a quarter, till you sport her, hoard her like a crack whore, leave her on the corner
