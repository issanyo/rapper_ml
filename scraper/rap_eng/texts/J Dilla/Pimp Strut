[Dank]
Yo
We ‘bout to make your club bounce
Make your broads trip
You hit your gas you might crash your whip
It's like that, from the Frank N Dank side of things
Is’like a brand new vet, when them gear shift change
We outta there, with yo’ hunnies in tow
I’m the one she really want, you a dummy with doe
Just the way that we love ‘em, you think it’s a curse
We go out and live lives, put it down in a verse
And the verses really real, they reality based
So you gotta stay real with the role you play
And I'mma play Madden and continue to grind
And if you ain’t down to shine, you can stand behind
And watch us do it all, we keeping it movin’
The same big move makin’ you be claimin’ you doin’
You ain’t really doin’ much, you fuckin’ around
So, me and my man’s gon’ hold it down

[Chorus]
You can bounce with a bounce with a bounce
With niggas that’s off the meter, rockin’ a wife beater, yo
And we gotta pimp strut like Fillmore Slim
And we do it cause niggas want to feel more slim
And we lookin’ way pimpish in our jeans and Tim’s
Put everybody on pause and we freeze the gyms
Like bounce, bounce with a bounce with a bounce
Bounce with a bounce with a bounce
Bounce with a bounce with a bounce

[Chorus] (repeated)

[Frank]
(yeah, you can bounce)
With a nigga who skate like roller skaters
But my skate roll on 20s need adapters and spacers
So my shit don’t rub, like I’m rubbin’ on these asses
Smile in her face with every intention to smash it
That’s what that ass get, for choppin with a player
I’m flagrant like Rasheed Wallace of the Trailblazers
So let me blaze somethin’, I leave a trail of broads
Like Biz Mark when they caught the vapors
I’m a person into making papers, so bitch please
I’m searching for a chicken that can get at my cheese
I’m sayin, pay my rent or somethin’, or let me hit for nothin’
Make your next move your best move is stop frontin’
And when you do it you’ll be happy you did
You can put this joint in and rock slow with ya’ friends
And get learned how two true players is livin’
And when you need it you can get a double-dose of this pimpin’

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Frank, Dank, and friend talking on the street)

[Frank N Dank]
What’s the deal my nigga

I need to party like a muhfuckin’ Jew dude
What’s goin’ on man where they at?
Where they at
Parties everywhere
You know I see am out here, I’m lookin’

[Friend](these boys talking bout parties, no one talking about the pussy)
[Frank N Dank]

Party for my mans, and it’s ‘allll gravy’
[Friend]You boys talk ‘bout parties and ain't no body talking bout no pussy
