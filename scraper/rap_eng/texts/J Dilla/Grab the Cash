[Intro: Pain in Da Ass]
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster
To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States
And it was….still is….and there is no going back now…..
Okay!!! I'M RELOADED!!!

[Verse 1: Young Toronto]
Driving round the ghetto streets, hungry as fuck
Looking for some good shit to eat, was shit outta luck
I was broke as a joke, nothing to my name, not a buck
I felt like a poor lame, I was fucking stuck
Hit up my niggas Didact, and JC, asked them what popping
They tell me they scheming to go bank robbing
I said “Word? I was just running low on funds”
They said Kane setting it up
Them niggas told me the plan, asked if I was in
For sure I was in, I’m getting cash that’s a win
I was the front man, walking in, held the gun up
“Gimme the money, this a fucking stuck up”
They gave me 10 grand, I was glad, like what a dand
To be honest I felt like the fucking man
We drove into the highway, man we got to fucking hustle
Last text I got from my girl was “baby I love you”
Was gonna respond back, looked down at my phone, smiled and laughed
Took my eyes off the road, suddenly I felt a whack
I went right into an SUV at the back
Then a truck came behind and pierced my car like a tack
I got hit right in the head, all I felt was a crack, it made a snap sound like a little cracker snack
They rushed me to he hospital, I was starting yo go
They telling me to hang in there, they still having hope
I couldn’t handle it, I started slipping, now way to come back
Here lies Jason Dayer in a permanent dirt nap

[Verse 2: JC Assassin]
Didact hit the click-clack, he call me, I’m feeling ill
Said it was one of his last calls, can’t afford to pay the bill
Looking at my taxes, anonymous documents
We gon' be broke by tomorrow, that’s my hypothesis
We got no dimes, no dollars, no decimals
My girl sick, we can’t afford the medical
We close to poverty, then Didact and Kane callin' me
“Let’s set up a robbery and steal the bank property”
I’m like “Kane, you insane? Nigga, what’s gon' be the outcome?
The police department ain’t nothing I can outrun
I don’t wanna get in trouble!” And then on the double
I stumble sadly, my girl livin' every night a struggle
I got a fam to feed, a daughter on the way
Call Jay-Day, he say he into play
Thinkin' ‘bout how much I need, got my daughter’s birthday
And if I don’t do something, my girl’s gon need first aid
Started to tremble, then I put down the flask
Go to the dollar store and buy an all black mask
I know I gotta do this but it’s a terrible task
My romance, she startin’ to lose the path
I hit ‘em back up, burner phone so they don’t know the operation
Thinkin’ if I got caught, it’s only prison or probation
I’m waitin', front of my door, there comes Kane’s van
They filled me in on the plan, said that Jay Dayer be the main man
Roll up to the bank and Jay starts shootin' rounds
“This a robbery, everybody on the ground
Hands in the air, we just here to get some numeral
Business as usual or it’s gonna be your funeral!”
Walk out with money in the bag, now we all fucking bandits
Girl won’t be stranded, won’t have to leave our kid abandoned
In the van, Jay check the phone while he hit the road
We gotta reload, hope the po-po don’t know our zip code
Crash! Happens in a flash, Jay hit a car
I got a scar, no seatbelt on flew me far
It’s alright for the time being, I turn to the left
Jay Dayer to the side, lookin' like he broke his neck
Police cars up beside us now
Why did we try this now? Police done eyed us down
Didact now at the wheel, Kane helpin' Jay out
Headin' to the hospital, changed routes, no way out
Stoppin' at the hospital, Didact brake red hot
Deadlock, I remember my girl dissing dreadlocks
And laugh, step out the van with my head cocked
To the right, police with a pistol, I get that headshot
That was the end of JC Assassin
This all started cause of some checks we couldn’t cash in
But now my baby got insurance money for my ashes
This the end of my story, I had a closed casket

[Verse 3: Gamemast15r]
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a gangster straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My homie's bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So we needs to hit a lick, drastically
So I tell Didact, told him the setup from the metro
Said he’d give T & JC a call, and that he’d let know
The get-go, that we’re robbin’ banks, but that he’d only get the best tho
Toronto don’t give a fuck, we’ll let him hold up the register area
They pull the alarm and he’ll bury em’, and we’ll be movin’ out like a carry-on
JC got bigger issues so he’ll go with D in the safe
Hell we can throw the hostages in there and seal their mouths with some tape
Me I take care of them myself I’m a people person
And if they talk, I’ll have them see through hearses
So I pick em’ up in the van, lookin’ mighty suspicious
But we’ll be mighty vicious if a cop pulls us over and tries to get us
Slam on the breaks as soon as we hit the front of the bank
Broke in, automatic weapons, we go in, armed like a tank
T yelled something among the lines of “Shut the fuck up, don’t make a fucking sound
Your getting stuck up, don’t luck up or I’ll put you on the ground"
He taking care of the main register, that’s his part of the bargain
Ten grand, enough to get some food and take care of his car again
JC takes care of security cameras, heads back with some stamina
Didact yells “Nobody move, don’t prove you're a man to us
We don’t want heros in this business, what is this? I’d told em’ I take care of it
And now they gettin’ scared of it
Mothafucka Grab the money, if these kids starts acting funny
Then Imma go and blast they mommy, then you can go and catch a hommi
You know I ain't trippin’, I want this money and no one's gonna stop me
He look at me shook, ran back inside and starts filling the duffel bags
We done, we hustle back to the van, fuck a double back
Now we out on the road shootin’ at police officers
No one is stoppin’ us, we’ll die for this cash, not go out in cuffs
Hit the highway, I don’t wanna die today
Jay lookin’ at his phone, is this the fucking price we pay?
He’s driving and we get a hit, what the fuck going on
Answering texts from his girlfriend, ironic now he broke his arm
Now JC injured as well, I wish I had something to relieve but now the coke is gone
In a blink of an eye, after two hits, we drive to the hospital
Like fuck the masks, look less suspicious, unless the EMTs see how our pockets full
Little did we know that was a mistake, we drop off Jay
We get out to push and JC gets headshotted by the Jakes
This scheme is fucked so we scramble the money and dash through the alley
Jumped over a couple fences and charged around this hooker named Sally
All the sudden Didact be looking at me and eyeing me
Desiring the paperbacks we just stole, won’t even say bye to me
There goes the hustle, instant betrayal, aims his gun at me, shows off his vest
There was a struggle, he shot me in the shoulder I shot him through the chest
I fly out the window, life flashes, every nintendo I’ve stolen and sold on the market, it's been hard shit, I gotta make it out alive, I gotta try my best
I fell in the fucking dumpster and all I saw were the cop beams
It didn’t stop me until I got incapacitated by SWAT teams

[Outro: Female News Reporter & Male News Reporter]
Earlier this morning a group of men went to rob the Bank of America over on Rosenthal Lane when it later turned a turn for the worst
Yes Susan, they appeared to have gotten into a collision on the interstate highway and miraculously survived. They then drove over to the hospital to drop off their friend, only to have him die in the emergency room and another accomplice killed by police. They later found another accomplice alive, shot in the shoulder, and bleeding when he was arrested by SWAT teams, the other accomplice was not found but police have not slowed down in their pursuit of him and it's only a matter of time before he get's caught. Now back to Madison for the weather
