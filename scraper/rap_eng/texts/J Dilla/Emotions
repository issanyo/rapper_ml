[Intro: Primere]
Yo
Real shit, I got emotions...
Look
Real shit, I got...

[Verse 1: Primere]
Aye, real shit, I got emotions
Steady plotting shit, and playing with the notion of
Being successful as a rapper, getting paid
And making ten times what mom and dad had ever made
Look, I got dreams, yeah big ones
And some insecurities too, I got to dig some
Up to the surface for my peeps to understand
I'm not a superhero, I'm another ordinary man with a plan
But you and I, we're much alike
We both got stress and tribulations, probably can't sleep at night
See demons in our sight, fears keep us discouraged
But we got to work to keep our families well-nourished
Yeah, I got emotions...
I'll run through mountains, swim through oceans - could never rid me of my devotion
This's for my parents, for my future, for my kids
If school ain't take my soul, well then rapping surely did
No illuminati, it's just been stressful
Baby hold my hands, kiss me on my head, tell me I'm special
This shit's taking a toll on me, honestly I've been tired
Physically exhausted, this shit's fucking with my mental, but...
Fuck crying about it
Then talking 'bout I have the best work ethic and just be lying about it
I'm here for truth, I'm here for you, I'm here for change
I'm here to make a difference, here to take away your pain, look...
I got emotions, believe me
Though rapping brought happiness so naively
Money isn't coming in, liabilities rise
Sometimes I feel like quitting so mom I apologize in advance if I fail you as a son
I know they say I'm next, I know they're saying I'm the one
But I'm only human, and quite frankly I'm young
I'm not ready to grow up, I'm just trying to have fun
But the world keep spinning whether I'm losing or winning
I'm glad I understood that from way back in the beginning
Life goes on, dawg I got to live day by day
But still that won't keep my ass from sinning
Truth be told, I got emotions, we all do (Aye)
But sometimes they bring us down
Sometimes I think about this shit I can't fix
These memories come around, stick around

[Outro: Primere]
Stick around, aye
B.Truthful, yeah
