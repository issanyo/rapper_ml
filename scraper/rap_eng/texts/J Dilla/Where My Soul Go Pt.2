[Hook]
(Intoxicate penetrate operate listen
Medicaid medicate meditate missin'
Maybe stay walk away how you stay dissin'
How’s your day sister where’s your soul mister)x2

[Verse 1]
Forget a rhyme I’m busy talking to you
Thought it best to get through to you
How’s your day how are you doing
I listen well I never say maybe you shouldn’t
From day to day I fade away what are you doing
Too stupid too ruthless in the face
The boy useless where you going you crewless
Get stole on and killed
No one picking up they phone God dropped the wheel
Family forced to put up with you I’ll write the will
Stumbling throughout the years
They’d miss you if you disappeared
Well your voice your presence isn’t clear
You give good advice your execution sucks
Nauseating as chlordecone
Irritating as rotenone
A walking poison I chloroform

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m a better friend from a distance
Text a phone and the truths written
In the norm I’m a snake hissin'
I hurt everything I touch who am I kiddin'
Just a screw-up two people left
I ain’t hurt you much
An album is a long time give it time
I’ll bet my last dime you’ll say too much
That's enough you full a shit
You a monster where’s a crucifix
Nigga need a crew to fix you
Apparently you misused
Adolf he needed a friend like you
Maybe you should try maybe you would save lives too
Maybe try to fly maybe you would see my view
Maybe you should maybe you would maybe you could
Maybe but I ain’t too good
I just may be too me understood

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Where's your soul mister
(Where’s your soul where’s your soul)
Where’s your soul mister
(Where's your soul where's your soul)
Where’s your soul mister
(Where's your soul where's your soul)
Where’s your soul
(Where's your soul where's your soul)
Where's your soul mister
(Where’s your soul where’s your soul)
Where’s your soul mister
(Where's your soul where's your soul)
Where’s your soul mister
(Where's your soul where's your soul)
Where’s your soul

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Manipulative to get what he wants
Bojack ain’t the biggest one
Can’t trust you far as I can punt
The less people around you the better
Lying little runt
Reversible Pinnochio your growth'll stunt
Rat yourself out settle the people’s hunch
The less people around you the better)x2
