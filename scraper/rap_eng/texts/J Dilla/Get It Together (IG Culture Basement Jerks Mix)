Get yourself together baby, before it's too late for ya

You said you can never be too paid, so what

[Verse 2: T3]
Start your funeral boy, write you obituo-
You shouldn't let you know who back in the studio
The flow that'll chew your whole ass like a tootsie roll
No laugh no jokes
And my loot is still usual for those who provoke
Get mush like a two-year old
Pushed in a corner 'cause you under control
Can't hold the fast-paced 'cause your pace too slow
'Sho nuff slow poke wichya face exposed
Put yo ass in the sling and do what you suppos-
And oh, here's a couple words I think you should

[Hook]
Whatchu gon' do?, yeah we comin' through, we votin' for you
Whatchu gon' do?, yeah we comin' through, we votin' for you
What's it gonna be, definitely, don't fuck with the D
Yeah we gettin' ill, just tell me how you feel, we keepin' it real

[Verse 3: Baatin]
Together for what?
The S is makin'em duck
Runnin' my mouth, sometimes i wonder for what
It just goes to show how many clits you blow for what
Just to get a number?
That's why my crew will never ever sit back and have to wonder, about another paycheck
My lyrics are definitely considered to be a threat
Like steppin' to the s would some shit you regret

[Hook (2x)]
Whatchu gon' do?, yeah we comin' through, we votin' for you
Whatchu gon' do?, yeah we comin' through, we votin' for you
What's it gonna be, definitely, don't fuck with the D
Yeah we gettin' ill, just tell me how you feel, we keepin' it real
