[Charles Hamilton]
I think we might call this The Bermuda Triangle... I like that
The Bermuda Triangle nigga, fuck whether you get lost

[Verse I: Charles Hamilton]
I’m too nice, your dude might get two mics in the Source from my lyrical intercourse
‘Cuz I spew these new types of venom
More crews might try to meet the DJ in the blue sky
Why two mics? ‘Cuz niggas won't get it
Let me translate for all you wild slow bitches;
Groups of emcees might puke and then leave the game, hang themselves to view my 16s
‘Cuz I write with God’s percision and Satan’s swag
You niggas is not permitted with your hatin’ ass
Stop your bitchin’ while I’m makin cash
I just drop a written to have you shakin’ fast
In your socks and slippers, I hope you got some mittens You in a hot position when I bake you fags
Open the oven my flow is disgustin’
But I make so much sense I bet Oprah would love it
So, let me be ignorant for a little bit
I sell fertilizer, I don’t give a shit
Hahah
Yeaaahhh. Who got next?

[Verse II: Show Tufli]
Show-
TuFli

(how fly? how fly?)

Now just watch how I take off, take notes
I got a offer soon as I stepped off the boat
Fuck with Tufli suicide get left on the coast
You couldn't take a step in my loafs
Muthafucka I'm the goat, and the toasted liver
I provoke, my hearts cold no coat
Your flows whack no hope
How the hell do you hustle but you still so broke
Show showed you hip hop, you still dont know?
I'm still hood, I'm still polo
The flows still dope, I'm still no joke
So while them jokes still after me
Them students, can't fuck with faculty
These niggas that wanna battle dont matter to me
So go 'head spit, and end up a casualty

[Verse III: Yung Nate]
Uh-
There's a lotta dead rappers out there, Show. thanks to you
This what I'mma do, I'mma bring nigga back to life, and then kill him again
Watch me
Ahaha
I'm just talkin' my shit

I'mma be dead still spittin, I grab ya crown with your head still in it
Where your favorite rapper? I'll rip him
With no bars on the track I just adlib it
Uh nigga, killin' dudes with this mic
The switch is my trigger
I won't dig a new ditch, just make the hole bigger
Pause nigga, No life support nigga
I run into the ER and unplug the cord nigga
I'm gone Sonny you not hot at all nigga
Call me Nate Zeus walk on water like ribbit
And if shorty fly, I fuck around and lick it
I want my money, and make sure they ain't missin'
'Cuz if you lose a digit, you gonna lose some digits
Thou shall not fuck with me nor Biggie
Unless you wanna relate this message to what big is
Tell 'em Hov got BK, but this my city
And it's not a big apple, it's just a big titty with (gets cut off)
