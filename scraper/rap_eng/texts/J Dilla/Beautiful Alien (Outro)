[Verse]
I know the depiction of the creature was macabre
But that's just the description of my job
Yup, and that's my creature with the physique
It's isn't petite
I know I'm rippin' the beat
It's freestyle season
Where we battle random people for no reason
I'd like to end the album on a good note
So come listen to these good quotes
And now tonight, I leave
I ask you all please share peace
So, without further ado
I'd like to cut it off and say thank you
For listening to the Scatterbrain
And picking the remains of my splattered brain
So today I leave this Earth
And right into the dirt I shall enter
As I present the...
Beautiful creature
Beautiful alien
Beautiful alien
Splendor presented and represented
I meant it
This organism needs reverence
What have you against a monster?
My mantra I conjured- die stronger
I played the gambit
And now I leave the planet
If you wish, I'll depart now
I'll refrain from showing my art now
This is the end of the saga
With a sound goodbye, I play the death of this drama
I All

[Outro]
And that concludes this album
Thanks for listening
Peace
