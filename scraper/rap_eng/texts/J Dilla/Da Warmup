[Intro: Thelonious Lincoln]
How yall doing man, its ya boy, linky linc..
Nah that shit is trash

[Verse 1: Thelonious Lincoln]
It's the thelonius, super microphonus
Out in Kingston w the Fam drinkin coronas
I got a bonus, in impalas doin donuts
Its a drop v, pull-up lookin papi
Lames copy, y'all niggas not me
Ya flow sloppy, take notes properly
On how to do this
On How we movin
Up on the smoove shit
Now y'all my students

[Interlude 1: Thelonious Lincoln]
Yo, Shoutout J Dilla man, this beat hard as fuck
Shouts out to Slum Village too
Niggas got me in my bag right now man

[Verse 2]
I'm the booth goin God mode
Got ya wifey eating out a dog bowl
And I can't even walk up in these cargos
Cus I done set my pockets on largo

[Interlude 2: Thelonious Lincoln]
(Fuckboy Laugh) out a dog bowl man

[Verse 3: Thelonious Lincoln]
Yo, I said I slide through dapper
Silence the chatter
Unload barrettas
Niggas move fasta
Slide on some bunnies
It's hella laughter
Before night fall shorty gon lick the rapper
But now we talking after, now she talking romance
I Ain't tryna hold hands, im just tryna hold bands
Matter fact x that, u can hold my gonads
That's just the way a QU nigga programmed
So baby get with the program
Up in Jamaica bumping slow jams
And a nigga gettin so tan
With some buddha smelling like toe jam

[Interlude 4: Thelonious Lincoln]
This is light jabs man, This is light jabs

[Verse 4: Thelonious Lincoln]
The Buddha burn quickly
The flows get sickly
I just might G U
Cus now I'm goin 50
And a nigga bankin, not up off no yayo
I'll bring back the game, just give me the say so
Just don't say no, or my youngins buckin
I am the Kidd, Kidd don't do no frontin
Stunt 101'in , y'all niggas lunchin
Don't make assumptions or we'll get to dumpin
