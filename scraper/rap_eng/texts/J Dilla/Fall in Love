Another night on the roof
Sitting outside the booth
Head in the clouds while im thinking of you
All the things we could do x4


Thinking bout
Life and death ya
What if i misstep //on this journey
What If everyone i love deserts me and im
Left for dead stranded  Just on this roof top
Rain rolling down the side my cheek like a dew drop
Moon rocks floating down the milky way
Had a couple rainy days
Writing tryna numb the pain
In a daze
Not fazed just confused and dazed
Tryna make it out this maze
Make a couple of waves


Another night on the roof
Sitting outside the booth
Head in the clouds while im thinking of you
All the things we could do x2


The things we do for love
Like a fiend to the plug
The shit like a drug
Cause everybody need Someone
7 billion people all looking for the tight one
Some want two but that rarely leads to happy threesomes
Rather have one who really loves you
Wouldn't put shit above you
Who Trust you
Who lights up everytime they touch you
Won't cuff you less you want to
Cause all they wants to
Just see that smile eyes light up for a while
Now Its been a long year drove a lotta miles
All this money on me still can't purchase a smile or
Find faith or love  or trust in above
Just lust emptied out into a glove

Another night on the roof
Sitting outside the booth
Head in the clouds while im thinking of you
All the things we could do x2


To fall in love to fall apart
From open arms and open hearts
To arms crossed lost in angry thoughts
Disappointed From trust broken
And One Too many words spoken
Words can be worst then weapons when they in the wrong hands
You'll probably wish you kept a couple in a life span
Wish you didn't leave left your keys on ya the nightstand
I Thought we had a future guess you had other plans Or maybe another man's
Another day another one who got away
Another love to fade to grey
But thats just to way it goes
Let love live and die and grow
Breathe and bleed and flow
And turn into something beautiful


The sun was her smile
She was young sprung and wild
She was young sprung and wild
He was
Full of nitro that fire
Had passion desire all that passion desire
I been
In that tight rope that wire
And it only gets higher
It only get higher
I been
Up late on all nighters
He a tired on the typewriter
Lover and figher
