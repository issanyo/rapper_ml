[Verse 1]
Tired of these niggas that just really think they hot
I be in the cut, doing things you never thought
Not selling rocks, robbing niggas, or bustin' em shots (shots)
Flying out them lines that'll get me to the top
Funny niggas think it's funny spittin' with that funny rap
I'm the type of nigga that give them niggas a heart
Georgia's back, niggas really be comin' weak
Well I say this, all (all) hail the Laxx P
Straight up out the south east
Ali, duck, weave, nigga I'm for ya mouthpiece
Niggas weak as Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, wordplay
And why you liftin' up that skirt bae?
Man I swear these hoes be thirsty as Gobi
Go play in traffic if you disagree with Laxx P
Free Max B, from where the traps be the classy
Writin' daily, and niggas know that I'm killin' em
I be on the pad, like a period, serious
Niggas just ain't hearing' it
They hearing' a beat
And a monotone tone, put your woman to sleep
The black sheep, niggas bitin' these lines
Think I don't hear it
Say get on my level, well homie, I'm not near it
I'm in the stratosphere, boy you lookin' up to me
Speak up, young buck, and then have a seat
I rip out yo guts, we 'bout to have a feast
Like the pilgrims did, when they finally found peace
You say you a g, really 5 letters after it
Lame, hyyerglyphics in my slang, and I mastered it
Nigga
