[Sample] x5
Allow me to reintroduce myself

[Verse 1: Pat G]
You've gotta remember me
The one and only Pat G
In other words your homie
Hit me when you feel lonely
This rap shit started solely
Know I am the only one
Tryna do it like it's never been done
And when this brand new record's spun
Rappers lay down like I've got a gun
My heart is the weapon, and it weighs a fucking ton
Searching for money because I don't make none
Still my momma's first son when this tape is done
Track one has begun, and I get it with no delay
Every thought that I relay
Will have it's day
If you hear what I say
Holla, show peace
Two fingers in the air ain't saying the least
Share the knowledge so we feast
Could you cut me another peace
On my grind until the day I'm deceased
When my music is released I feel so high that I must be faded
Said I'm wack then they debated
On if music should be graded
My history may be jaded but it was never evaded
You should hear what I stated
When lessons are related
My vision was created for the purpose of dope verses
Being in this game you can see why I'm subversive
Speak my raps like they're cursive
Might even come off coersive
With all this crazy shit I'm spitting there's so much under the surface
You fake rappers actually should be writing wordless
With how much y'all been clowning me you better join the circus

[Chorus: Pat G] x3
I've got to be the only one
To go and get it done
Chasing a dream that's just begun
Stay up til the morning sun

{Verse 2: Pat G]
Yo
I'm back up in this bitch like I never left
Stealing time from rappers like a case of theft
Know it's gonna be alright no matter what the depth
Success is in my sight because I might be one of the best
As long as blood's bumping from my chest
I'll deflect hate like a vest
Ain't no time for rest
You know sleep is actually the color of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence life was defined
Feel my breath flowing as this rap was designed
To penetrate the walls of the mind
So you can see what's inside
My pen paints pictures and here they reside
These verses are scriptures the religious will confide
In, not just my pen, These words turn to action
If you need some advice-
Rewind the song again
And when you hear what I'm really trying to say
Give me the OK and in this rap game I'll stay
Prepare yourself before the next song that you play
