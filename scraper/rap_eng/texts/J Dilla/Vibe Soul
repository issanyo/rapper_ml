[Verse One]

Writing lyrics started off as something undersized
Now I visualize what I wanna do deep inside
Y'all don't think I'm serious? I'm trusting my instincts
Moms didn't see this when I was an infant
I know she thinks it's a faze
But the music I make reminds her of jams back in the day
She told me to keep a balance
So every night I pray to God for this talent, and not take it for granted
I don't know how it happened, it was magic
I'm on my Chris Angel, in summer school studying math angles
Earning my stripes like the Bangles
I'm lapping negus, no Mary-Go slow pace, I know my place
It's in the booth, I find this easy to do
Don't need a masseuse, cause I ain't tense like Medusa's statues
Coming right at you with no left hooks
Just words that leave your cranium shook
I eye the bigger picture, no Captain Hook
I might write this song without a hook
I'm not sure, I gotta see what's inside my mind first
The exert the verse into my rhyme book

[Hook][x2]

So lemme catch the vibe
I won't stop until the World is mine
Hip-hop will never die in my eyes
It will go through into the afterlife
Not let this shit ride

[Verse Two]

The vibes phenomenon, why the Babylon gotta cuff arms
Don't possess any firearms
Word is bond, my songs carry on like a Triathlon
I'm next, so transfer the baton
I can't cease now, I gotta keep going on
Make everyone, shriek out loud, and not take the easy way out
A pen and pad can start a new family revolution
I'm just trynna make a contribution through music
And laugh about it later at family reunions
While everyone is cooling, not having to stress about being in debt
Some of these negus are so suspicious
Always asking for more then three wishes
They want the riches, the bitches, with the paparazzi taking pictures
All of it ain't a good mixture
They start putting up a front like motion pictures
But I won't change, I'll still remain the same
And stay true, to the blood in my veins

[Hook][x2]
