Yo come on let's go
To all the mothers across the world
Come on, yeah

First off, let me say it's real love I speak
It's my job to make em dance, so excuse the beat
See it's all about you, I hope you're hearing what I'm sayin'
There's only one woman that makes everything okay
And that's Ms. Norma, at least that's what they call her
Since she start going to church, don't smoke, don't curse
She let me do my thing, never press me to change
And even if I'm wrong, she bless me the same
And that's love from the soul, till I'm eighty years old
Gotta a room at my moms, some dough and a change of clothes
Cause that's where my heart is, I know I act retarded sometimes
So I had to put it down in a rhyme
That I love you more than ever, I told you you're the one
You let me do this rap while you look after my son
So I can play late night with the microphone
When I hit the jackpot ma, I'm bringin' it home
So you can stomp in the church and give praise to God
And know your son's gettin' skrilla from workin' hard
That's all, I hope you know I'm proud to be part of you
And I wanna make you proud of me, so come on

(Hook x2)
Ma where would I be
Without you always coming through

It's been twenty-seven years she been there for me
And it's going on six, she been there for D
Cause see, that's my moms, I love her with open arms
So she love me right back, gotta love her for that
Ma dukes was around when there was no one else
Three kids in the crib, all by herself
And when things got bad, moms made it new
So I think it's bout time I start praising you
And all things you did way back in the day
The woman you were, makes me the man today
And mama I need that, I'm teaching my seed that
And I love it when you giving me positive feedback
About the music we create, that's why how you relate to it
You being happy really brings something great to it
It make me work hard to get it
Whatever you got I hope my daughter can get it
Cause ain't no woman in the world like you
And for that ma dukes I applaud you fo' real

(Hook x2)

The best mother
I thank God for all you do
This one's for you

Mama where would I be
Without you always coming through
