[Intro]
Detroit is bleeding
If you're young black and male
You're more likely to die by violence
Than by any other cause
[Turntablism]
Die by violence
Die by violence
Than by any other cause
Like, a whole generation is being wiped out
I, like, they just don't care about, life it's nothing
[Verse 1: Tone Plummer]
Gimme the track and I'll murder it
I come from the small town maybe you've heard of it
Detroit: land of the Cartiers and murderers
Where most cats probably keep the burner tucked
Blowin' on a zip of that piff
Rollin' in stolen trucks
My congregation on land mines: we blowing up
Put a 45 to your tan line, now hold em up
I spit what I know not saying I condone this stuff
But that's your mentality here when your home is fucked
We out here tryna make a living or make a killin'
Or make a killin' on any nigga that's livin'
Tryna juke cats like Robin Givens
You rapper's my sons
I've watched you grow from boys to men: Micheal Bivins
To you Scotty Pippens who coat-tail and name drop
I hope you overdose on this verbal coke and your vein pop
Interfere with my growth, it'll lead to a grave plot
Only thing that they'll find is your DNA at the Save-A-Lot
So stop telling these lies
Talking about that we ain't hot
The D home of the dopest period
Some of then ain't drop
And some of em your favorite rappers, mine too
This year cover your mouth nigga, swine flu
We everywhere in this city, maybe behind you
Even the little kids can probably out-rhyme you
You could be halogen based, I'd still outshine you
Pay attention to the rhetoric
Cheers for etiquette
[Segue: Hon. Coleman Alexander Young]
To attack Detroit is to attack black
Politicians ran for office, by attacking Detroit
[Turntablism]
Detroit is armed and dangerous
More guns than there are people
People breakin' in
They come down here
They see nice houses
Oh, now I gotta protect myself from them
[Verse 2: Mr. Wrong]
You know the best is found here though
Alot of people call it recession ground zero
Responsible for these legend and town heroes
On the hunt for these Benji's and found Euros
Monumental murals
Murder mig mayhem
Make Pakistan look like day camp
But the best place to get that A ?blammed
This ain't a gang land
'cause everybody hustle here
You got a right to be scared
You better trust your fear
I'm an advocate, spokesperson for cannabis (uh)
Savages, surviving the laws of averages (yeah)
School system got them acting like they screws missin'
The lead beams get red wings on stool pigeons
The murder capitol, ain't nothing that I'm proud about
They killed Patrick for everything he lied about (see)
My city limits taught many men to divvy digits
Ironically, the economy got them being evicted
That's why the rebirth is necessary
Everything is secondary
To what I'm speaking of is legendary
You love your city ain't no doubt about it
Thugs do
But the real question is: Do your city love you?
See, I'm the one nigga that most niggas will vouch for
Should be the mayor, or at least head of city council
At least head of city council
[Segue]
The truth may hurt, but the truth is
Detroit is burning
[Turntablism]
Like a whole generation was being wiped out
I, like, they just don't care about, life it's nothing
