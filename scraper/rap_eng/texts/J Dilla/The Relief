[Verse 1: Swami Mags]
When I'm looking at an hour glass
I never let an hour pass
I'm always workin' hard, never catching me on my ass
I pull a card from my deck, and put it back
But never showin' that
Magician when I'm spittin' flows out of my magic hat
Freestyle or written either way I got them both
Imagine that
Hanging on every word that I ever spoke
Like "Yo they got it BAD", and when I'm writing fire
It's amazing how I'm not burning my pad or getting any higher
'Cause every line I jot is dope, and all my rhymes inspire hope
Pulling you back from the end of your rope
But it's difficult to cope, when you're given all this power
And it doesn't take you past getting these dollars by the hour
Because of that this shit is getting sour
I toss aside the fruits of my labor
'cause on the good times I'm tryna savor
I'm having trouble describing to you the flavor
So I'm bitter-sweet with it and it's rare when I do a favor
I'm drinkin' up, but I'm staying whiskey neat with it
If I'm put inside a box you'll never hear a peep in it
As far as bullshit, I'm steeped knee deep in it
When I'm in my death bed I want some clean sheets in it

[Verse 2: Swami Mags]
I'm a master mind
Just watch him as he pass the time
I'm possibly a master in the disguise
Of a young but wise
Gentleman just look at him, while he improvise
A couple lines, it's such a sweet surprise
Can you believe your eyes?
Life filled with lows and highs, so I keep some tree around me
I know some people despise how I can be so unafraid to die
Like I'm a zombie
But I'm a monster, so that implies that I'm justified
I get it how I live while livin' a life that's free of lies
Sooner you realize that I'm talented and gifted
The better, enslaved every letter of every alphabet
English is my weapon, mass destruction when I handle it
I could see your empire, and then dismantle it
World domination if on a radio station
See they kept me under wraps because my raps are the equation
To the atom bomb, and my flow's a terrorist invasion
I don't typically brag about it so just know that I'm about it
Don't doubt it
If it's a battle you want you'll face defeat
'Cause on the best day of your life your skills simply cannot compete
