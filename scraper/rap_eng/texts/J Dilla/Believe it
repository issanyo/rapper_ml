Attention ladies and gents excuse the bud fragrance
Of this potent smoker with a poet flow and a great stench
Equipped with the patience cause raps is like kicks when i lace it
Keep it legit and rip the track without a statement
Moving lyrics forward while they're backwards with the hating
Interesting topics but its closed caption with debating
They trynna throw spikes onto the course while i'm racing
But i maneuver with steez rolling backwards with the skating
I tell myself all the time Loui_D is so amazing
I always support this multi-talented free agent
I'm ambitious in this position i keep playing
I'm on top of my game with no need for replacements
I get high and fade into the sky like a spaceship
In tunnel vision with the poker face when i make chips
When i see the bull horns i just take grip
And terminate the flows that's exposed like a straight rip
Using lyrical physics with the rhythm swiftly
Killing them with the illest delivery realistically
Militant but yet diligent with artillery
Utilizing it lyrically mixing my own remedy
With intelligence cultivating my own energy
Riding it smooth, motorcade call it Kennedy
Minus the enemy, sniping from the grassy knoll
And when i spit it the lyrics is frigid cause the track is frozen
Riding the flow systematic cause the track is coasting
Simply dominate the position til her back is broken
I love this verbal comedy because the fact i'm joking
While these other niggas is epic fails with the lack of focus
The flow evolved like it reacted to a savage potion
And keep it flowin' til is dumped like i'm ashing roaches
And murk the track with individual reasoning
Clipping the spliff and then hitting the chicken with seasoning

Believe it
