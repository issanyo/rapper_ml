Uhh, yes yes, y'all
To the beat, and the S.V.'s is rockin it swift
Yes y'all, lyrics just come off like shifts
See when I'm on the microphone how fly I get
Yes y'all, my crew don't take no bullsh..
Bullsh.. not never, never get wet up
Eh-eh-eh want to know why the crew's gettin better
Not sayin ish, just gettin my flows together
Yes y'all.. to the beat and
What y'all, if you hear what I am sayin
H... get dig down and get dug down when I start sprayin
Cause when I'm on the microphone there will be no delayin
No playin

You think we talk cause we don't bust caps
Others be like they're weak cause they don't kill in they raps
(Kill in they raps) UHH that~! We from the city of crooks
N....z be dyin for givin them fake-a$# looks'll
Get yo', ish took quick, check it in
... pony down while the hoes Errol Flynn

OOH, OOH! With the usual
My ... sip on chamille to a fruit Mentos, Mentos

What do you get with fruity Mentos
You get a phone # and a light-skinned uhhh
Let me tell you 'bout redbone, she give a good blow
Just to let you know that my crew is the don
The good ol' boys, flat out, we number uno
The S, capital V-E-E
My name is Baatin, ras O-Y-C
Like to get busy, just, let me know
I like a good freak, after a show
It's nice to penetrate, a beautiful HUH
Pick up a microphone, then I'm at it again
Tell the whole damn world that I'm, just a friend
Rip yo' lady, because she called me her master
Your whole damn crew wanna, do me slow
Now I'm back, wearin yo' momma like a lambskin
We can do this, like never before
I'm a FREAK~! And if I tell you once mo'
It'll be the third time like my n...a Arell
Mysteriously the S, prevail
Like them ziggan in penitentiary jail cell

When you grip the mic boy you whack as hell
And I can tell, and on the mic they call me RL
This is for the N who get rail for rail
Doin tricks with the mic like Michelle Farreil
And I'm real with the mic boy as you can tell
And my crew is the whole ride, you see we never would fail
Or front subject, and if we do - tch, oh well
It'll never happen thus we have protective shells
And to the beat, my crew's never obsolete
With techniques, leavin you six feet deep

And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the beat, and you don't stop
S.V. got the shh that just drops
And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the beat, and you don't stop
S.V., is the in-fi-not
And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the beat, and you don't stop
And to the..
