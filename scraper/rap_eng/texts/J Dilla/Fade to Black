[Verse 1]

It was all good
Just a week ago
Can you really believe
We hardly speak no more
To tell the truth
It's some things I don't seek no more
Say you feel the distance
That's cause I don't like to reach no mo
I should really figure out my next move
It's always more to gain
When you got nothing to lose
Now my shirt
The same color of the flag of a Piru
You left my shit with more
Than a damn bruise
As the blood ooze

[Hook]

Watch us fade to black, x2
When we fade to black
It ain't no coming back
No it ain't no coming back
Cause I ain't with none of that
No I ain't with none of that
Uh no no


[Verse 2]

No times can't go back
How they used to be
Cause I ain't the same person
That I used to be
I know everything fades
This ain't new to me
At one point of time
It was you and me
I thought
We could be something someday
Now all I wanna do is runaway
I got caught up in the rapture
While you got away
I watched you runaway

[Hook]
