Locke convinced me that I needed proof
While Descartes assured me of the answers in my head

Socrates once asked me
If I knew anything at all
But I argued “that’s a stupid question”
And told the jury called

About a, a beautiful hemlock tree

My teacher told me Sophie’s world was good

But I opted for another option
And applied to film school

I'm told it’s a useless degree
But at least it's better than philosophy
