Narrator : "Once, thirty five years ago...Cheney had worked for Rumsfeld
It began in the Nixon Administration, when Rumsfeld was looking for a staff aid..."

Frank Carlucci : "One day, Don called me and said
'There's a...young intern on the hill named Dick Cheney, Frank, uh
I'm thinking of hiring him I'd like you to interview him and see what you think.'
So I interviewed uh Dick and called Don and said
'I think this guy's pretty good you outta hire him.'"

Narrator : "They would be closely linked...for more than three decades."

Jay Electronica :
Pigs with the heads of men, spat acid
That lasered my third eye closed, like LASIK
A midget in a casket like a baby in a bonnet with a bottle and a basset
Horn playin' the theme song from Children of the Corn
Oh I must be dreamin'
A lady in a night gown puffing kush screamin'
Signaled me over psst you with the waves
I seen you from the Catholic church steeple diggin' graves
I got your number sonny
So ain't no use in fightin' yellin' or running from me
I never ran ma'am
Well then you ain't a clever man Sam
Listen, the two faced king from Britain and Rome
Had a baby in the bush on the Grassy Knoll
Where they peeled back the orange head peel of a gnome
He said he emcee, I know you like killin' them
You terrorized the skies for twenty-five milleniums
Now you settin' fire to land
You the lion you the savior the messiah the lamb
You need backup he movin' on the youth at dawn
Call Badu and get Tyrone on the megaphone
Tell 'em I sent you and your codename is Megatron
If trouble come use your brain like a telephone
He'll take you to the Chocolate City
Where Two Face and the prince of darkness have they committee of snakes
Drill 'em, let the skin peel off to reveal 'em
Then spray 'em with them rhymes you like spillin'
Hit 'em up real real good but don't kill 'em
We only wanna burn 'em to the point that they willin'
To give the location of the blank faced villain
Who split atoms and give mushrooms to civilians
Hiroshima never recovered
And all the evidence was smothered
Under a thick cloud of rubble
The pope is his brother
The hillsides is his mother
The statue with the torch and steel eyes is his lover
She's a harlot, who stood still like time while New York turned scarlet
And the levee monster sucked up New Orleans
While they was playin' man verse man in Afghanistan
With they mind of Iran, Iraq and Sudan
Let 'em recruit you
He will try to use his powers to seduce you
Just let him think that the feelin' is mutual
'Cause if he found out that you already knew
The atom had a positive a negative and a neutral
He'll probably salute you
Then wait 'til you turn your back like a coward and shoot you
Man this shit is crucial...

Yea, you from the Third Ward right
Very treacherous
A place where they kidnap assassins and bury specialists

John F. Kennedy : "*This administration has failed to recognize, has failed to recognize
That in these changing times with a revolution of rising expectation sweeping the globe
The United States has lost it's image as a new, strong, vital, revolutionary society."

Kase (New York City graffiti artist, quote from 1984 documentary film "Style Wars") : "*Shoot I got styles already that's more complex that nobody know about, I mean super duty
Tough work huhuh, see this is just semi-like what I would call it, but if I really get into it and
Start camouflaging it...I don't think you'd even be able to read it."
