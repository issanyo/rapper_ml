[Verse 1]
Honey I'm home
Yeah I know
Sometimes I roam
But I always make it back to you
The Golden Age
I just wanna bring it back to you
You see I had this thang for you
Since I could remember
You was the one I ran too
When it got cold like December
You gave me blessing
So its only right that I give thanks
Never will I let these feelings "Cast Away"
And be missing
Like Tom Hanks

[Hook]
Like The Golden Age
I'm bringing back that Real Hip-Hop
Don't get it twisted
Na I don't sang
This ain't no Kool & the Gang
My nigga
This more like WU-Tang

[Verse 2]
They tryna kill ya name
With these ringtone rappers
That never rap about what really matters
I mean not everybody living all flashy
I mean you got yo' problems too
Don't act like everything is all jazzy
I give my people word of advice
So they can relate and be happy
Painting pictures that's so vivid
I want my lyrics
To heal they mind
Body
Soul
And spirit
Never will I sell you a dream
I won't even you show a ticket

[Hook]
Like The Golden Age
I'm bringing back that Real Hip-Hop
Don't get it twisted
Na I don't sang
This ain't no Kool & the Gang
My nigga
This more like WU-Tang
