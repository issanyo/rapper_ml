[Verse 1 Licky McSticky]
-One, two , three to the Fizzo, tell me who got five on the indo
I keep a spliffy lit on some Licky McSticky Shit
I dont fuck with high grades, Smokin til illiterate
Attitude on fuck a bitch
Niggas don't love you till you kick the bucket
So Im crossin off my bucket list
These hoes only good for slurpin dick
Dont let em gas you like they different ,they ain't legit

[Verse 2 Ace Cartar]
-They was waiting for that comeback nigga stop frontin, like you ain't wish you was cuffin
With someone you trust to build something, from nothing
Now you acting like its nothing, running off emotions that are based on assumption
Yea your a real man complaining and smoking weed
Instead of working and grinding for all the things that you need
Work on your business plan so your vision can expand
Pointing out a females flaws doesnt make you a man

[Lickyy MSticky] They wasn't Waiting for shit except the motherfuckin bud

[Ace Cartar]
You thinking type of sick and you should nip this in the bud man
Take a second evaluate who is frontin
Don't make a big scenario out of something that wasn't
That serious oh she ain't call ya phone
Told you she would see you at ya home

[Licky McSticky] - Nah its different nigga I dont think i own here, but you dont need a bus a train to come around the corner

[Bridge]That shit sus my nigga that shit sus x4
[Hook]Bitches ain't Shit Bitches ain't Shit so im gonna get Licky McSticky Dicky Licked x4

[Hook Ace Cartar] - Stop frontin, why you always jumping to assumptions, fussin over something that was noyhing x4
