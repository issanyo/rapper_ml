[Light Language Intro:]
(Andrew Bartzis to J Dilla)

[Trash Rap:]
"...A lifetime worth of stuff to share
So thanks for being with me today
You want the raps?
You're gonna get the raps
These are the ultimate gourmet raps
They're a little bit more
...busy than I usually make for my self
But we've got some house guests
And everybody's really really hungry
So I'm gonna hook this one up
This is one variation of many
But these raps are satisfying...
These are what you do when you're tripping on a cheeseburger
And you really need something to fill you up
That's Dilla-icious tasting, okay?
So let's make the ultimate bodybuilding raps
These are satiating satisfying raps"


[Verse : Ryney]
Mmm...
For Dilly and the Doom
Really step back
Give white boy some room
Let the plums drop in his fruit of the looms
Spit out kumquat and a cherimoya too

Mmm...Food...
How does he preach heat and hold non-violence
Shh! He about to quote the villian now, silence
Raid the room and let all the cockroaches pile in
Straight wylin'
...like a coyote
Yellin' MEEP-MEEP at the system that could never hold me
Keep your eye balls bulging
Unaware of the third
The shit he spit is scolding
Beware of the turd
Handle with caution
When you pick up absurd
Lyrical more unidentified than spherical
I object!
Jedi spits empirical evidence that we are all just miracles
And hence...
I AM

Just an I AM presence over a Trashy beat
In this ever present moment
The creation secrete
Impregnate the womb of the mind
I don't use a rubber in all honesty
...and honestly
You're on a spiritual odyssey
Doe! Homer Simply from the island of Crete
ILY lad
...I love you...

Ryne's been from the greet
In effort to hop up out the pin of the sheet
And apart from the sense of separation
Though ego is a much needed deceit
Til he go in completely 5-D'd
To remind the ear drum of the heart sacred beat
All that ancient past and ancient future selfs
Are still part of we
Ubuntu!
Cuz our I AM is free!
Might tell a germ
To reconnect it's control to alt and delete
And manage the task of our own sovereignty

Now strike a chord of equity
To only resolve the prob
And provide the spiritual remedy
Jay say
My enemy is only a mini me
That I created long, long ago
And only want to cut off my lineage like the Kennedies
Dilla spin on the Stanley Cowell samples in the Illusion Suite
Sit back and roll a sweet
