[Verse 1]
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

[Chorus]
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Tried to move but I lost my way
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
'Cause you never know where the cards may lay

[Verse 2]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, ooh
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

[Chorus]
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Tried to run but I lost my way
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
I said ya never know how the cards may lay

[Outro]
Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day

Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day

Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
