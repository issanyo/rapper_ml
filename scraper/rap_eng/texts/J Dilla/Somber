How it pains me seeing days goes sailing
Colors blend together like stained glass in the making
Is the best way to describe the vibes that I'm faced with
Only speak what's salient when delving into Hell's abyss
And what I fail to list is that what I have mooted
It was true that through the music I found therapeutic usage
It was soothing. Deep rooted. It left it's claw marks visible
Even with my friends I feel as though that I'm invisible
Putting back the pieces that I thought were indivisible
To listen for the underlining meaning is important
Trying hard to leave my shell. Instead I am left here like a tortoise
With the shortage of support I walk around like I'm war with
My own unconscious: the badge that I am sporting
Plan ahead or get your head lost to it
Knew that even when I thought that I was finished, I'm not done yet
The only thing that makes me feel alive is the sunset
Painted on a canvas or it covering the ocean
There's emotion in it's beauty and it truly makes me unstressed
The dichotomy of feelings are alive as we
Happiness and sorrow now are harboring a rivalry
Caught up in the middle, thumbs twiddling, pacing
Heart racing for a second as I step on what's inside of me
Overcoming any obstetrical that rivals me
