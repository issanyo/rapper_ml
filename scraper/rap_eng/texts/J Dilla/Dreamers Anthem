(By a raise of hands how many of yall believe in a dream?)

[Hook: Yup yup put your hands up high, Yup yup puts your hands up high, Yup yup put your hands up high, If you dream every day cause it gets you by (2x)

[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

Uh, I dream every single day, I dream in every single way
Im just a human being this path im aiming to pave
I dream of a better future I see it better today But
Mentally it seem so close, I'm tryna master music I speak over metronomes
I got what it takes to be where the telescopes
When its aimed in the sky and the sunset doesn't show but
I was taught that patience is virtue
When my time is ready you know ill burst through
With some sick rhymes when I spit mine its curfew
Blood, sweat, and tears thats why I invest
You can't take that from me like money and IRS
I make good music im tired of all the stress but my dream keeps me sane and I truly know that im blessed
I truly know that I'm blessed

[Hook: Yup yup put your hands up high, Yup yup put your hands up high, Yup yup put your hands up high, If you dream every day cause it gets you by (2x)

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]

When I rap I could plead, When I rap I could cry
The struggle feels eternal I probably wanted to die
Maybe not die but wonder how I survived
Cause I been going through hell or maybe life in disguise
Or maybe its an omen, im hoping something inside
Cause I know what lies in store for your boy will keep me alive
I know I got the drive until my engine stop
Im on cruise control until I see big and pac
With Hendrix and probably Bob, with Lennon and Aaliyah
With Dilla they spot Lamont, They saying they like my songs
I told em ill write as long
As I have a heartbeat in my chest, a set of lungs and a tongue so I can speak and catch my breath
This dream keeps me sane and I truly know that I'm blessed
I truly know that im blessed
