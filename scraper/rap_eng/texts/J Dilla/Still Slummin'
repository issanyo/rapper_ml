[Intro]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Verse 1]
Took off my work badge, realize I'm back in the hood
Like what's good, my cousin called, told me he coming through
Like "Yo what up, why you back bruh?
See you should be laying tracks with J. Cole and who knows
Maybe he sign yo ass
See I don't know just how this rap thing go
From the looks of it you closer than most niggas that I know
Please explain, way I see it bruh, you paving lanes
What you don't believe cause boy your songs did some things for me
Had me thinking we was trapped, but Lute you set us free
Niggas stay focused, when it's right for you, it's meant to be
Every time I play a song you gain a fan
Nigga you the man, drop a song, what you waiting  on?
You in high demand and that's life
Only one time to get it right
Take a flight, view this world from a different height
See this hood still the same, no matter how you view it
You got dreams, I just rather you pursue it
Just promise you never change, I don't care just how you do it
Fuck them niggas you ain't gotta prove shit
And see this hood still the same, no matter what you doing
So for you I empty out a whole clip"

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Verse 2]
As I let the Chevy skate, like Tradewinds back in the day
Wish upon these stars like "God, show me that way"
Cause ain't no looking back
Been in the trap so long, I'm tired of shooting back
Keep your eyes peeled, don't let the steel hit you
Envy be that bitch that fuck the niggas that chill with you
That's why I can never trust these niggas
Trigger finger itchin', contemplating should I pull it
Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet
Brother Pooh called me up, he told me stay consistent
"The fact that you yourself what make you different
Like fuck the gold chains, diamond rings
Keep your eyes on the prize, that don't make a difference
Cause you're still a young king without the bling
Keep your eyes on the prize, shine on these niggas"

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Outro]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
