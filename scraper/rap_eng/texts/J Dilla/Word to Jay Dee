[Verse 1: Stevie Bucks]
Thinking back on life I think I must laugh
Niggas wanted beef and had a buss pass
They say if ain't fold it ain't enough cash
I’m seductive with the yay like buff ass
I was selling yay when I cut class
Shining like diamiond cause I cut glass
Hundred dollar bills it’s like a mud bath
If I couldn’t eat I probably would fast
I remember days and times it was hard to sleep
Thoughts like when it rained and where I parked the Jeep
Cause my life is like a whip and at time the tops miss
I be speeding rush in the heartless feelings
Fuck how you feeling
You niggas shit ball go ball in the d-league
My niggas top dogs, top dogs want to meet us
I put my parmesan on you chicken fajitas
I’m a breath of fresh air shell toe adidas
Ask rev run and I run to the pizza
Do it for my little sister Anaya and Aaliyah
Walk with a full page, like Aaliyah
