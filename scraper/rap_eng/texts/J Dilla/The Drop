[Silas]
Let it drop when I drop the t-top
I'm in and outta three spots, in a matter of seconds
Throwin lures, maneuvered through hate you just bait to the great white!
Sharks lurk, cops lurk, it's the same thang
We switching plains, tryn maintain
In this world upside-down
My choosing is flipping frowns with this music
Flew first you can stay coach
I'm on a spree, well, don't choke
See the hope in my eyes, on the rise to success
Or the process, to pro-gress
With society beside me, they tryn ride me like mule-
Autto on the move, clue the bottle in the bay
Can you follow or must you stay
Pick a day, never sway, Colloway the way I rep hip-hop
You can talk all that talk if you want rather give a thought
Want a job, tell a dame use her brain pick a day you can start, uh
Just thinking bout a mission listen I'mma get em
When I six and didn't get a shit about your opinion
I'm that same fuckin nigglet
Give it how I live
Nothing different, something different
Just another vignette

[Tae]
This that shit, make you wanna go get your bread right
Howling under full moon, light
Meaning I'm a wolf, this a long night
And we all here, coast living, stanky sessions
For the vets, took the blueprint, Chevy built it, reinforce
Got that old soul mix
With that cold feeling, shit is getting ugly, so these lyrics
Vengeance for the Fallen
Tell em we miss em, as we avenge em
On the route to the races, in your memory we live it
Revving up them engines, feel the essence
Drum fuel injected
A 90's baby, know the difference
The air over here so refreshing
This all started from the birth
The thirst for the green, the paper comes first
I built a custom hearse for the beat
On the bay, everyday, cooking up each sentence
Feel the breeze
