[Verse]
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
Never hesitant, move like the cycle of time
Show benevolence when me and Nasir align
It's a whole 'nother other, we the soul to the gutta
Different shades of copper, we shakes the chakra
I'm a Brooklyn repper, they raised me proper
No need for pressure, I display that posture
Of a nigga gettin' it, this that real nigga shit
Governed by different forces than intelligent beings
Be precautious, it's more than the element seems
From the mezzanine, I sit and I acknowledge the show
Elohim gave me the light so acknowledge the glow
Follow me flow, the ever of the Wallabee toe
It's whatever, was taught to get it though the economy's slow
Don on the low, escape from Williams and Blake
Without a scrape, sometimes I await feelin' my face
Started out good but then hardened by the hood
Any nigga I cross, please pardon if you could
Captivated by crime from uncivilized minds
The leader person is blind and I care for his own kind
Took time, but now I mix etiquette with the rhetoric
Move like a delegate but still on that whatever shit
Sparklin' bubbles up in the champagne
Just sippin' and trippin' on when I ran game
My diction is different, I understand fame
Was cool with the Wu before the Clan came

[Outro]
The season
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
The season
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
This is the season
Nasir season, AZ season
It's back to catchin' wreck on tracks for no reason
