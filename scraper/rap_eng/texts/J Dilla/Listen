Its the biggest nigga you know eyeing your chick
Must be in your blood cause you dying to trick
And it must be brand new cause it dont even fit
So leave all that vulgarious life to me
Cause im the only cat out here thats right to be
Laid out on beaches with sand on the back
But my man soon did hand to hand handling tracks
But all of us together on top of the world
Bond when we click like a string full of pearls
Got big dreams like big ammunition
So people all around Ay Yo you should listen
