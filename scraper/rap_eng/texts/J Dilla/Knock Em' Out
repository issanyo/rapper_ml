{Verse 1 - Noveliss]
I'm surgical on this walk of life, I only take it holding a mic
Put you on the operating table open your life
Show you the sight, that you've been missing with only two eyes
Noveliss use lines to guide you away from new lies...
Welcome to Dilla Instinct, case closed
Master of the "mask cover your face" flows, they call me Jago
Who ready for war the Lyrical pass Halos
Noveliss Master Chief get in line to become an Angel...
Dissect ya, mic wrecka' the mecca
Verse of the year factory raps Kenny Omega
For the record, when the world needed me most, I wasn't here for em,'
The Sound Bender, don't play it by ear, I smash ya' ear drum
Thw feared one, but also we veered, I live through music
Live by the sword, chopping it up, more Jin than Mugen
I be the all sleep losing, the light at the end of the tunnel is translucent
The image of my future is blurry I can't do this
Lose my mind probably, shades of when...
Playing ball goes from, being your life to just a hobby
And them jump shots you was taking get replaced with blunt hits in the rotation
They invented the Matrix to keep us grounded at basic
No hope for the stranded, say the sky's the limit
But they got drones on other planets
The candid bandit, stepping out the chamber of rhyme
I'm a teenage Gohan perpetually trapped in his prime...

Knock em' out the box Nov
Knock em' out
Knock em' out the box Nov
Just knock em' out
