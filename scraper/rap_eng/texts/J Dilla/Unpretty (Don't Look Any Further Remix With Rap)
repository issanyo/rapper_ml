[Left Eye]
Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty
Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty

[T-Boz]
I wish could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Chili]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

2 - You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up the M.A.C can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so damn unpretty

[T-Boz](Left Eye)
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too
(Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty)
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me, hey

[Chili]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin' yeah

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Left Eye]
As I reflect back on what I used and abused
And detect that I need some clues to get through
To those that accused me of never being true
I'll lose if I play into this game and never know the rules
So how do I bring out the me nobody sees?
The forest for the trees
How about the woman behind the weave?
The light from within is life is the only real remedy
Or find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty

[TLC]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty)

Repeat 2

[TLC]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
(Ha, ha, ha)
You can buy all the make up the M.A.C can make
But if you can't look inside you
Be in the position to make me feel so damn unpretty
(Find the reflection you see to be so damn unpretty)
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
