Its like the picture is me sitting at the beach, its playing tricks, but when i spit, my lyrics tend to deceit, I'm just a kid how live is completely up to me, is it a sin that i admit what i grew up to be, i know im just a rapper, i flow with all this chatter, such a disaster this games shows but are they really just actors, look at these greats as they turn into mythology, sat and wait for a prodigy whos lyrics was so dirty they needed some dermatology, no prophecy is risen, to listen is physiology
