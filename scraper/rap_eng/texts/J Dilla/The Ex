Yes
Big Dilla

Bilal
Here it is
Yeah, it's for you

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
Hey, Remember me? Take a look baby
Yes it's your ex- he off the hook, ain't he?
I'm doing my thing, thanks, you did me a favor
I'm through with the games and straight with the silly behavior
And I knew it was over, I was hoping it worked
See I can't go to work with you going berserk
You going through shirts, you scoping for dirt
And what's worse- you searching to only get hurt
And no I don't flirt with every pro in a skirt
I'm better than that, i'm trying to get this cheddar to stack
You steady thinking about what I did in the bed with you
And if i'm hitting other women instead of you
See we can't grow close to not get along
They say you don't know what you got til it's gone
It's hard to move on but we gave it a chance
And because you wasn't ready for man (Ree!) you left me

[Chorus: Bilal with J Dilla]
Remember (okay, Remember you left me so let free (free!)
Remember, (uh it's for you) Remember you left me so let me free (please!)

[Bridge: Bilal]
You got it all glistened(?) up, in your own way(?) I got mixed up
Ain't heard from you in such a long time (hey!)
Let me pull over
You're still looking good, doing well
You said you saw me in that last magazine, well I'm doing good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Dilla]
Well let it be a lesson to you for choosing to jet
I'm through with the stress of messing with you
One second you're cool and you're foolin the next
And who would've guessed the best you could do was leave me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uh it's your man Dilla Dawg
Pete Rock
Bilal
That's how we do
Y'know this one of them joints
Put it in with your ex while you freaking her
Strapped up with the lubricated trojan...
