Reasonless oppression
They don’t know the weight of their words
How it could damage the soul on criminal accord
Putting them into the morgue
They bring us down to elevate themselves
The snakes hate to see us make our wealth
Break apart barriers staked in the chase
For a future, divided a minority we are
Past dreams making us raise up the bar
Mockery of us because of pants hanging off
Intimidated by us because of some slanging white rock
Kings of us getting attacked by cops
Jim crow would’ve made us drink water from a dirty mop
A prop in the screenplay called society
Ignorance from both sides caused our notoriety
Restricting our visions, still prescribing the past condition
Not the cure, nor are they working for one to be done
They haven’t won, not yet make them regret
Calling you the word that you weren’t supposed to get
Forget not the roots, those hung nooses had us spooked
I retaliate over a different type of loop
This is for the men and women with open eyes
That keep their ears and closed hands to the skies
We the people are responsible for our messes
But what we people learn from it, is timeless

[Hook]

They may knock you down
They may shoot you down
But you gotta keep pushing and pushing for that crown
