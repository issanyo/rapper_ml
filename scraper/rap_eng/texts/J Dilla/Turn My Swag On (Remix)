Screw men, give it to me

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh

They told me round my hood
What they say?
Every time they see me I look good, yeah
Why? I'm gettin' money, yeah

If you be hatin', just be mad at yourself
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Yeah
But I did it without you, yeah

Said this is for them chicks who be handlin' they business
Got M ups to them haters cause we too busy winnin'
You can't tell us nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Dime Divas, give it to me

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh

They told me round my hood
What they say?
Every time they see me I look good, yeah
Why? I'm gettin' money, yeah

If you be hatin', just be mad at yourself
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Yeah
But I did it without you, yeah

Said this is for them chicks
Who be handlin' they business
Got M ups to them haters
Cause we too busy winnin'

You can't tell us nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
If you ain't gettin' money
Then you ain't got nothin' for me

Cause I be gettin' paper like you wouldn't believe
And I be gettin' haters like you wouldn't believe
So what's up? Yeah
Boy stop, yeah

Swag ain't somethin'
You can wear on your neck
You can buy you a chain
But you can't buy respect

I'mma walk it like I talk it
So you never forget
And if you get your swag on
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you wake up in the mornin'
And you turn your swag on
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said what's up? Yeah
I'm gettin' money, oh
