What is teaching social studies / really all about
To understand context / of California's drought
To read between the lines /
Of North Koreas lies /
To explore the world around us /
And see what we can find /
If you want to be the best that you can be /
And understand this thing we call democracy /
Then put your phone down / turn yourself around
And take a deep breath and listen to this sound /

Of my voice / in your ear / speaking clear
Asking questions about adventures far and near
Like how did we decide that power should stem
From the color of your skin
And not the length of your hem?

(Or)

Why so many people staying needy
When everything they need is in the pockets of the greedy?
It's time to take charge/ you can lead or you can follow
But know that taking orders/ is a hard pill to swallow
I've given you the tools to succeed /So put it all together/ and work as a team
Won't be finished in a day/ you won't be finished in a week
It takes more than time to destroy apathy

It's the C-O-double-L-E-C-T-I-V-E approach
Without it you'll be living all alone just like a roach
To see it/ believe it/ to breath it/ to grow
We need to/ commit to/ the choices/ we know
Will help students put their lives in context
And not just study/ for the next big state test
We're adults, it's our duty to learn from out faults
And raise a generation that will give it their all
See
It's up to you and me
To be the best that we can be
Collectively
