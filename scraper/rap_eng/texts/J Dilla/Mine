[VERSE 1]
Picking the pockets to look for some profit
Mocking the mockers so they do not mock it
Tie a rope on they hand, plug in their socket
Put him in a astronaut suit,fly it up, rocket
Teacher, teacher, miss, mister
If i dont follow trends, am i a hipster
But if i do, im a sheep, follower?
By asking questions, hope their ain't a problem sir, oh miss
If u dont know the answers dont take it as a diss
Dont feel threatened that a kid is askingthese questions
Dont give me a detention, although i really won't mind
L'll brag to my friends, got one for speaking my mind
Running through my time, my dimension
Basically means i skip to the extension
My world, my universe
A beauty verse, beauty hurts and beauty is a curse
Disgust is clean and beauty is dirt
If love dont happen dont make it work
Existence unusual, gifted birth
In the misery is where i lurk
Conspiracies is what i search

[HOOK]
Ive been through the darkness
Been through the light
Benn through wrongs
And i been through rights
Been through the greed, been through the hatred
Can't wait till the day that i tell ma that i made it

[VERSE 2]
Times have been hard
Feeling like a small fish in a big pond
Its been awhile since i prayed to the dear god
Made mistakes so i gotts right these... wrongs
Write this song
My story, no extras
Im the best,uh, nothing more, nothing lesser
Fixing my hair, still tryna to impress HER
I dont mess with apologies and sorry G's
Still fascinated by Greek philosophy and the life of Socrates
Building my dynasty with the basis of rivalry
I write all my songs for freedom
I say each of my words cuz i really do mean em
Dark times. seen em, demons, beat em

Prophetical vision, with the message im given
Its hard lving this world, when u ain't really living
Its either you an angel or you sinning
Either you losing or you winning

*still got friends on my friends list that need trimming*
