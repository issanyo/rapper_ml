[Produced by J Dilla]

[Hook: J Dilla]
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I never felt quite like this
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I never felt quite like this
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this

[Refrain 1: J Dilla]
Incomplete when you're away
You turn my nights into days
You show me the light, uh huh
Gotta have you right away
I never felt quite like this
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I never felt quite like this

[Refrain 2: J Dilla]
You breathe life into me
Well, I think I'm in too deep
I'm addicted, uh huh
Something tells me you're the one
I never felt quite like this
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I never felt quite like this
All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I never felt quite like this
