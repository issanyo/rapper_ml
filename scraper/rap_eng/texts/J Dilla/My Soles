[Verse 1: A.C.E.]
Step into my soles, feel the gravel below
Feel the pain as I travel on this abandoned road
I strive to obtain it, you’re satisfied with almost
I’m attempting to attain it, perfection is my goal
Ascension of the soul to the uppermost parts
Of the heavens and descending with food for the heart
Kinda like manna except this manner of music
Manifests its influence forever in these students
But back to the topic, the whole concept
Of this project was to redesign your optics
So you can see the object, the truth amongst the nonsense
The voice despite the noise, after that continuous cycle
You finally find your joy and you get that peace of mind
I’ll give you a piece of mine cause you reap what you sow
And you’ll see that I’ll shine, so I’ll wait for my time
Please step into my soles, see life through my eyes
Cause no one really tries to see what I see
And I see that the sea is bigger than me
But I still say that I’m deep, and I know that I know that I know
That I’ll peak to my true potential so please just let me breathe
Uhhh... I said please just let me breathe
I got visions I got to speak like Joseph, why can’t you see
I got to be thrown into the pit before they bow to me
This is my moment of honesty I’m in need of that honour
Peace God, now my purpose is explained
I’m taking the globe on a trip straight through memory lane
Peace God, now my purpose is explained
I’m taking the globe on a trip straight through memory lane
Step into my soles tell me if you feel the hate
Step into my soles tell me if you see my fate
I’m living my life well you living a lie just to be safe
And with that being said, I rather die than be fake
You said you were the king well the next step you make
Will be your last move, you lose, check mate

[Verse 2: A.C.E.]
I push past personas and pass you the truth
I’m not a conscious rapper, don’t tighten my noose
By labelling the kid you try to limit his use
Don’t define me, just understand what I’m trying to do
I’m trying to prove that I can do what I said I can
And despite your mockery I prevail with my plan
The same people that slapped me try to shake my hand
Said I could never do it but now they say I’m the man
Damn, I still can’t live my life like this
I’m such an ignorant, belligerent, misfit of a kid
Who resisted resentment though he received contempt
Never learned from his past though they were filled with regrets
A fool to the world, but what’s the world to a fool?
Just a dream- I seen the scenes from my memory pool
Regret beyond regret seeing myself with innocence
Ever since I was a kid I’ve been cursed with this gift
Rehearsing the verses that purged through my skin
I found meaning to my life, let the story begin
My mind stressing, I’m paying too much attention
To the lusts from within, such a beautiful sin
Searching for that happiness in all the wrong places
My timing wasn’t right and my condition became embracive
Priorities started to shift, From plateau to cliff
My mind was on the music, my grades began to slip
Time will chisel me to the core, I’m not who I was any more
You’re more you now than you were before, that’s for sure
Now there’s a different light shed on you, same you same skin
All throughout my high school years, I was impatient
There was more beneath the surface, my façade was really working
Some scratched at it but they could never pull back the curtains
But eventually the time, place and condition aligned
I understood it all, but it was too late to rewind
But never late for divine intervention, so I knelt
Placed my palms over my face and asked God for help
Asked God for wisdom and told him how I felt
Like why I lost my sense of judgement and how did I lose myself
I didn’t hear any voice, but I knew that He was hearing me
Rose up from my bed and then read verses that brought fear in me
Try to change my ways as I studied the man in the mirror
The end is getting nearer the nearer I get to it, the more clearer
My vision of myself and this world is, step into my soles
Feel how controlling they all is, now you gain momentum from the moment
Do what you regret and later you hope God accept your atonement
Betraying actions and genuine motives, habits and contradictions
You missing the message my mission is more or less receptive
Step into my soles, through this poem see my perspective
Reminiscing the polaroid photos of the past in the present
An adolescent transforming into an adult, lessons learned
Mistakes made, from the cradle to the grave, that’s life yo
And this cycle, got me shifting pace, my soles are burning
On this fiery path that I take, silently praying that my façade breaks
And someone anyone really can see past my mistakes
It’s Time Place Condition, I’m just praying that you can relate
From being labelled before being able to change my ways
To becoming aware that I’m a King no matter what they say
Step into my soles, stay still and start to embrace
These dreams inseparable by time or space it’s A.C.E
