Couple Years Since Been Contemplating / Ya'll niggas see me in my zone,  yea i been concentrating / Its never complicating / Cause
Ima be star And people from afar gonna see I'm brightest in this constellation / Demonistry the way these demons compensating /
They want my body and my soul because Its consecrated / Fuck being President Im here to crash inaugurations / System holds
A lot of shit like they be constipated / smoking sour for the ease / they bumpin all my music from the houses to the P's / Fuck
Police They ain't out here for a G / So My niggas had to learn to flip the ounces into P's ./ Ironic how they always tryna lock Us For a Key / But they ain't open up the door when niggas knocked to be at peace / Now we mobbin at the feast / Hope my prey is fast as me / Yo pass the piece / I'm a turn his ass into a masterpiece / got pieces beneath seat never clipped joints / this 16s lit, look like I loaded up the bitcoin / at this point nobody could stop me I'm counting faces / you jokers I'm a king Ima deal with them smokin aces / my queens they all black you could tell by the shade / every night they in the club they showing love to the spades / wait I'm the great I do it in 16 or less / I'm dissected beats in my section
