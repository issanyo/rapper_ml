It's the jawbreaker, scamming kids for a quarter
Fuck lawmakers, we rather live in disorder
You go to where I came from, you'll probably get shanked
Know the kid controls the game like Jonny & Plank
The bombest of ranks, recruits better stand bout face
And follow the fucking orders cus you can't outrace
The face of heat-seeking missiles, you peep peep an issue
And I'll fix it quick, flip the script fast like politicians did
When proved wrong, if you're stuck, then you move on
You won't get a discount on life like a coupon
Caesar salad with no dress or croutons
Work with what you got and say yes to new non's
Pause, sick nasty like a Kanker sis
Have them shitting bricks like a swift kick to the pancreas
Maybe it's the customs or something inside his brain that is
Controlling him, petroleum jelly down to his anklets
Jacking cus he's got nothing to do
No one to screw, none to lose, just a cup full of juice
So what's the use? Broken, I'm expecting no recover
Cus love is hard to find like Eddy's older brother
Sucker, I'm a modern-day Rolf
From a faraway land, we're not in the same boat
No responsibility for my enraged goat
Então, não fique perto, vai, bem longe
I got buttered toast as Ed says
Flows that wreck heads, known as the best yet
At least in the cul-de-sac, but shit I'm not holding back
Kid, I've been the best-kept secret since Double D's boring hat
Dork? Nah Kevin, I'm more than that
I raided you pigeon and you won't get your quarter back
Choice and in fact, I take charge
The name's boss, kick ass and break jaws
Mother lover, sinking 8-balls
Passing the days on
What a great song
Sing it like Nate Dogg
