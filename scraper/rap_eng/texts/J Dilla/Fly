[Verse}
Some days I want to quit my job
And take a puff, of weed
Instead I pour me up a glass
The liquor speaks, to me

[Vamp 1]
It says relax, you've got bills to pay
Oh but one day you'll be, a star
And you'll be running from the fame
Just don't lose track of who, you are

[Vamp 2]
Oh but these worldly woes
And ambitions always get the best of me
Life is a metronome
At least can be when you have greater to achieve
I know you know

[Hook]
Fly, oh fly
Open up your wings and take off to the sky
Your fate awaits the road
Let nothing stop your go
Hurdle the obstacles
Take control
It's possible
To fly

[Verse 2]
Oh where do you go (when the seasons change)
Do you keep searching for (a message in a bottle)
How do you vibe
When clouds divide
If they reside can you simply
Pass them by

Repeat [Vamp 1] [Vamp 2] [Hook]
