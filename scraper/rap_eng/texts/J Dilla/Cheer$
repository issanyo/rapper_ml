[1st verse]

I ain't no Mac Miller
I ain't no Wiz Khalifa
I'm the type of nigga that make you and yo wiz kha-leave-ya

Take you to the room
Boom boom skeet skeeta
Give you the 12 inch hoe, No speaker

Had a chick named Nikita
Dark as an African
Jay jay tasted like, cream on paprika
Spanish chick named vita
Fucked her friend named Maria
She found out and all a nigga heard was this

I do not know what you're saying, get out my ears
I'm trying to focus like contacts intact with my career
She treats me like dark-skinned niggas that's on Madea
My dear, I'm just pressuring my peers
Into, taking Macon Hamilton serious
But see you treat me like a target no sears
That's why I left you hanging in the whip like a deer

[Hook]

Smoke and drink beer
Speak and don't fear
Excel first class nigga, no leer
R.I.P. to Jay Dee we sing no Aaliyah
But actions speak louder than words so shit, cheer$

Repeat x2
