[Intro]
Extra!Extra!
Diagonally moved like some checkers
Bring it back cause I'm checking the mic

[Verse]
Came out yesterday after it left for a year
Spinning the globe like gravitational fields
Feel that boom, bap
Magnetic like Doom traps
Welcome to Kevin's room
Where everything is abstract
Been predicting my diction
Since I put up my rhyme barrier
My donuts only show up in slumber
Four and two and three and one
And by the time this is new
My next albums done
So deep
I don't exist
The people have been amiss
So I have to tone back my kingliness
Keeping physical manifestations minimum
An idea you haven't heard in millennia
So much so that it all seems so new
And when the match is struck, you realize what you might do
Don't melt that wax!
What was I doing?
