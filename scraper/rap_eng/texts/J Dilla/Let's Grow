[Intro]
Real niggas only
First of all, what's my name
Five-Nine
Yeah, I got something for you
I got something for you, yeah

[Verse 1]
They call me Royce 5-9 or Mr. Always Ice Cold Wristed
Or Mr. None Of Your Business
Mr. Consistant In Conflict, for so dope lyrics
The hardest hitting nigga in show business
Came in this game with a pissy-ass attitude
Arrogant like, shut up
Laughing that you a trick
I wasn't happy before but I'm happy today
I'm rapping today, looking to get a plaque in my day
So I met this White boy one night
Who turned out to be the illest human being I ever heard in my life
He took me under his wing and showed me some things
And molded me into a pro until the flow was mean
Taught me not to do it like this, but to do it like that
Threw me all types of love and I threw it right back
Though we don't talk as much, we never let the game consume us
Cause we too real, my nigga Slim, let's grow

[Refrain]
Let us grow up, now we got here
We can't stop here, we too far
All my niggas, y'all my niggas
And you all know who you are

[Verse 2]
Royce 5-9 or, twelve men in one
About as explosive as them shells in your gun
Mr. Quick To Pull A Thing On You just for your loot
Mr. Mr. Mr. Quick To Swing On You before he shoot
I'm the finest tuned rapping machine rapping a scene
Since, way back when there was only rapping in Queens
Suck my balls if you competing with me homeboy
I don't dream, I'm the type to just be homeboy
Sucka free is like a religion I honor and serve
And more common in words, a song with you, what's in it
Y'all niggas is all punks and your jewels is rented
And your diamonds is all dark, like they blue but tinted
I would never kill none of y'all, I ain't that fool
But I will stomp the shit out you, I ain't that cool
You ain't even gotta greet me when you see, matter of fact
You better give me five feet when you see me, where you at
Let's grow

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Royce 5-9 or, one cent nigga
Bitches know that with me that the cum gets quicker
Mr. Always Got Some Cris' Or A Pistol
Rather diss you than chill wit you and will hit you
The insanest monster that came and conquered
A game that remains to be full of trained imposters
I will not let you niggas talk to me, no way
This is not what I'm here for, give me my money
Faggots only attract faggots, and that's that
You rap rat, you fuckin roaches and black maggots
Feelin my heat, I talk shit from the moment I wake up
Turn right around and talk shit in my sleep - let's grow

[Refrain]
