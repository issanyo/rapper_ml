[Verse 1: Noski]
I sat there and watched as he proceeded to play his music
Begging for attention from these thots we was cool with-
I let him have his moment
My main focus was to put him on
Plus his confidence needed this moment
I can't help but wonder
What they'll think of me once I'm gone
Will the world have an epiphany?
Or will it carry on?
I walk the land with a gram
Pass the L like a baton

It's deeper than rap
Shit, it's deeper than music
Pearled lyrical tracks
(I) Get u high off that new shit
Yeah
Your old mad he a nuisance, He ain't hit it right
You was up at night
All it took was the tip
She brought me rounds all night
She came first, Me last
I said a joke, she laughed
The Kidd fresh, call me prince-
(Haha) Yeah, Ain't have to finish that line
I'm cool, tho I still shine
Slaying Demons, no Blade, shout out Elder K

[Verse 2: Noski]
There ain't no love for a scholar homie these hoes want thugs
While they scheme and fuck ballers
Boy get your paper fuck love
Yeah, get your paper fuck love
Don't get high on that drug
I seen it happen befo'
My homie had him girl, more like a ho on the low
She played his ass for fool
Now he can't love no mo'
Damn, anther sad story
"My nigga said you was the one, why'd you do him dirty?"
Tryna fuck with different squads like Robert Horry
I told him, "Don't worry, she gon' double back
Not that you'll want her back
But just to know that she came running back
Let's you know you could always tap that"

If you catch me in the club you know I'm in the back
And I'm always strapped, I ain't talking bout a gun I'm talking bout the mag
We can do that
She just want to have fun so she cool with that
So I called Smooth up asked for his pad
Now we driving down Biscayne kinda fast
I'm tryna' fuck her before the wifey gets home
I thought these hood rat hoes was something that I've out grown, guess-
I was wrong cause, I'm bout to risk it all
With some chick who just loves me cause she seen me ball
Kinda pathetic
Only time I race home is when I'm bout to bone
Kinda pathetic-
But, you know how the game go love I'm sorry
Double standard, love I'm really sorry...

[Bridge: Noski]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I saw you over there lady
And I just got to know where to find you
You got my mind going...

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I saw you over there lady
But it's just not my style to approach ya
You got my mind going...

[Outro: Noski]
"Something ya'll niggas can smoke to this shit feel me
Y'all niggas can groove to this shit
Y'all know what this shit is man..

Keep that shit authentic G, fuck all this bullshit
Man, niggas just tryna make records"
