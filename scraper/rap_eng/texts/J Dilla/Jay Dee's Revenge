[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Teeth fucked up like a hockey player
Stayed up out of the hood like a bad carburetor
And teeth like this? And a face like this?
It's like a sign around my neck that say "I like to lick clits"
So bitch who's next? Wrap your legs around my neck
I bet I'll have ya coming rubbin' all on your breasts
Rap Bobby Clarke smoking squares by the carton
Staying in the front like handicapped parking
That's why you bitch wanna suck my dick, holmes
But that bitch looks just like a wishbone
And that shit sick holmes, never would of hit home
Used to run train on the bitches out the group home
Just a little nigga smokin' Tijuana Smalls
Mamma still washing shit stains out of my drawers
Look how far this little nigga came
Whoever would of thought I'd fucking change the game

[Hook]
It's official now
I don't think they know man
Detroit stand up
Danny Brown, J Dilla x3
The rebirth of Detroit

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Fuck with me you'll need Darth vader, light saber
Latin King razors the size of Sal Masekela
You're softer than that rock band in Asia
The touch euthanasia
The flow is euthanasia
And you an Anastasia
I've been fucking bitches since
Texting hoes with the pager
304
If you little nigga then you don't know
I'll stomp the shit out of you nigga, you won't grow
I'm fucking your momma, nigga you don't know
Yo' crib all day, you get out of school at 4
My little brother just got his CCW
Front all you want and, my nigga, he will bust
I'm a grown man, I don't play with people kids
I just blow weed, drink liquor, and smoke cigs
I got a lot of win nigga, I ain't too athletic
My little dawg will do this shit and put it on his credit
You think that I'm playing? Turn your hat to a sunroof

[Hook]
