[Intro]

[Verse 1: Hanuman]
I'm inebriated
Past the point of logic/
I bought a quarter of that kush
And a fifth of tonic/
To the dome is what's in me
Smoking on that sensi/
Your crew is going to get cleaned up
While my crew who's looking gritty/
Mobbing through the city
Looking for some shenanigans/
Spotted a house party
In the neighborhood and ran in it/
Scoped out the girls
To find who I'm gonna mess with/
Chugged their whole keg
Of jack daniel's in five seconds/
Then some dude came up to me
Like "What the fuck bro?/
We was trying to get crossfaded
Now all we got's dro!"/
Replied "That's all you had!"
Jacked the entire bag/
Then stabbed that fag in the calf
Then ran out the pad and laughed/
Wish a nigga would
Put a warrant for my arrest/
That whore's about to have a quest
I warn you: don't try to test/
Take the world out
With a cloth and a knife/
Homie I'll off you tonight
Nigga you thought you was nice/
I said: take the world out
With a cloth and a knife/
Homie I'll off you tonight
Nigga you thought you was nice, Han/

[Verse 2: Swami Netero]
I got a reputation
For extermination/
Of these perpatrating MCs
That want to gain some veneration/
I raise the murder rate
With every word I learn to say/
Cracking vertebraes
When I spit in this accursed cadence/
Could be termed a rapist
Violating pussies/
Ain't a killer, but don't push me
Heart blacker than Whoopi/
All i need is good weed
Munchies and some music/
The rest is fucking useless
Stabbed that nigga cupid/
With the arrows that he uses
Ruthless is my middle name/
What'd you think the 'R' was?
Motherfucking renegade/
All you should've been afraid
Bred to murk a microphone/
Every word's a milestone
To get me where I'm trying to go/
It's all about the timing tho
Fuck it up you'll never make it/
Know I'm about to head for greatness
All I need is dedication/
Ought to know my reputation's
Sharp as a knife/
I'll off you tonight
Nigga you thought you was nice, Swam/
