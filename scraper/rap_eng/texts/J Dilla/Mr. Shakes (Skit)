I long to make love with you
To a whole album by, J Dilla
The Yancey Boys, Illa G
As you look at me, and blink your eyes
And our heartbeat together
To the sound of the D
I grab your derriere it vibrates at my fingertips
As the moonlight, shineth off your cheek
I rrrub it and caress
Kiss me, pleeease lady
Kiss, me?
Don't fight it!!
