[Hook Sample]
Lemme Tell Ya Bout The Feeling


[Verse 1]
Whats good B, I'm in the city
Hanging will some fools , Im about to pity
You niggas acting gritty, real gritty
Got your bitch i’m about to have this kitty
She wanna get it on , I never fail like my kidney
Do you ever get me
Swagged out of town I meet real people
I dealt so much when I was in rehab
From being mentally ill , But I still have depression
I admit it I'm a very sad rapper with no impression
Almost gave up rapping but I decided to get my fame back
MY career was failing so I had to get up
Got my head in the clouds I've just gotten up

[Hook Sample]

[Verse 2]
Those times niggas asking
"Where the hell Did Kay Dolla Go really
Did he really Dip after Soul Theory"
Made Dead & Gone three years later
In those three years I was being catered
Saw my chance to go back after I faded
This time mama Kay Dolla Finally made it
Maybe sooner or later I will be the greatest
I made songs That should’ve been rated
A man again , Second Album right here
Getting noticed by a lot of my fans
This where I Stand
Being back again like I never Left

[Hook Sample]

[Verse 3]
Last verse I will make this count
No love from my city , Nobody's Popular
Except the niggas and the bitches I fucked with
Work all day , go into the night shift
Holiday is coming it's December 25th
Tell me who's boss and I can be the leader
Run this shit until I break the meter
Hitting home run's The black Derek Jeter
You niggas must be hungry Give you a breast feeder
What does all this mean , IDK but I still intervene
Two and a half men in the room no charlie sheen
I'm serving to the dope fiends
I stuff lettuce in my jeans
I make the Wu-Tang Cream
I will tell you all this is green
I love your Bitch that look like Harley Dean
I make it Fabolous whenever I breathe
I could see it in you I don't need to read
