[Verse 1: WhoisLonny?]

As the Days Move, I'm Stuck In the Same Mood
I sit in the same room
Playing the same tunes
Nas and MF Doom, headed nowhere soon
But you aren't either, what up God I called but
I couldn't reach ya
So I hit the Grim Reaper
Said I've been dying to meet Aaliyah
So go ahead and take my life
I've been ready to die
You can see it in my eyes
When I cry in that dark room
Since My Ex played me like the
Harpoon I've been dancing
With the devil in the ballroom
And I'll tell you He ain't
Nothing to dance with cause once
You start them prayers never
Get answered, and six bottles of
Male enhancement only half as
Hard as getting out his hands is
If you ignorant I'm Talking bout
The devil's grip, don't lose your innocence
And fall into that shit
It'll fuck you up son
I pray to god I never hold a gun
But if a nigga cross me like Iverson
I can't be held accountable for
What I've done,
Ain't proud of shit I did
I'm better off dead with a
Muthafuckin' bullet in my head
