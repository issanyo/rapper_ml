[Intro x6: Common]
Fly Love, uh uh say what

[Verse 1: Common]
I don't stress it baby
They say you got me dressing crazy
Eating veggies, wearing shirts extra medium
And if we break up, I'mma eat meat again?
I feel complete with you
Shit, I held up signs in the streets for you
In the streets people ask about me and you
I tell them "We go through what most people do"
Let's, let go of fear love
We can grow as long as my beard does
You push me in the way you supposed to
We ain't runnin' when we come close to you

[Hook: Erykah Badu, Common (Pharell Williams)]
-Erykah:
Come close to me
-Common:
Come close baby, Come Close ma (Baby)
Let me hold you love, come closer love
-Erykah:
Know this world gets
-Common:
It gets crazy baby, it gets girl (But)
-Erykah:
What's it without you, you, you?

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Eh, I know you used to watch me
Rock Gucci and Versace
But now I'm back to my skater roots
I still got friends in them gator boots
But what's up with them hater dudes
Ma, hating is OK with you?
Why? Cuz they drive in them fancy cars
Look, well I can ride you on my handle bars
On my BMX, baby
I'm creative with Tourette's baby
My testicles full of ecstasy
When I think about you naked, please...

[Hook]

[Bridge: Erykah Badu]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
I don't stress it girl
They say that you and I are from different worlds
You're from underneath the underground
And I understood my Hip-Hop run to this position
I don't stress it sweetie
You write in cursive, I write in graffiti
Opposites, not really we just customize
For my turfs, hey I'm instructing you to listen
I'm saying that a rat's ass I couldn't give
Even though you're far away, in my heart you live
So bring your little sweet face closer to me
And look into my eyes tell me what you see

[Hook x2]
