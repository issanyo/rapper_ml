[Intro: Illa J]
Yeah, it's Illa J!
Umm, but y'all already know about me
I'm 'bout to tell y'all a little bit about my
My fam' and my siblings and stuff
Who I grew up around and, who inspired me
To... get where I am right now, check it, yo

[Hook]
These are my, amazing, family ties
We're Made of Aquarius, Libras, and Geminis
And we call, ourselves, the Air Signs
Just breathe in the music, music

[Verse 1: Illa J]
Martha, thank you for your wisdom
Uhh, you know you taught me game
Now the ladies on me now, just like James
I've yet to meet someone more intelligent
Than my big sister, got all my friends intimidated
Try to talk back, my sister get evacuated
Educated is an understatement
She taught me to be myself and, fuck the nation
Put the middle finger up, it's all about the donuts Heh, Martha, you so silly
Why is Earl's nickname Pink Willy
Hehehe, we so silly

[Hook]
These are my, amazing, family ties
We're Made of Aquarius, Libras, and Geminis
And we call, ourselves, the Air Signs
Just breathe in the music, music

[Verse 2: Illa J]
What up Earl the Pearl!
Crazy, with the pencil and eraser on the paper
Sketch your life after he met you twice
My brother overdo it sometimes
Extra thrice, you know you showed it
But it don't matter, cause you my bro'
White or black...
Your ass need to get back in contact
Close enough to feel the impact of my flow
It's funny as hell, your little brother John grown
Like MJ with the pen I'm in the zone!
Uhh...

[Hook]
These are my, amazing, family ties
We're Made of Aquarius, Libras, and Geminis
And we call, ourselves, the Air Signs
Just breathe in the music, music

[Verse 3: Illa J]
Now to my brother James, how many nicknames?
James up there making beats with Rick James
And James Brown and Bob is making another Moog
On the same cloud because of you
I can sleep with the bass loud
Got me looking like a superstar
Yo, I'm 'bout to take this shit super far
I appreciated the kicks in school
Stayed a year ahead, and speaking of the year ahead
It's Yancey Boys bitch, make noise!
No uhh, louder, make noise!
James, I know you right here with me
James yo, I know you right here with me

[Hook]
These are my, amazing, family ties
We're Made of Aquarius, Libras, and Geminis
And we call, ourselves, the Air Signs
Just breathe in the music, music
