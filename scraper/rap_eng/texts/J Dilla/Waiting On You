[Intro: Phife Dawg]
Girl, you know it's you I love and not another
You may change, but I will never
Come down...
Check it
Looking at your face, you're no betting man
Watch my poker face expose your hand
Them cats sitting out in a caravan
Watching me and you walk, holding hands, uh

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, you, you, you

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Just came back from watching the game
Allen Iverson putting cats to shame
Now I see you and I ask your name
Think about  putting you in the frame
Notice how I saw your face before
In Michigan, R. Kelly tour
Nah, you never saw no parts of the Mo'
Straight New York, I hear you, yo
Probably I saw you in a dream
Well, anyway, here's the deal it seems
Tonight, you and me, we going out
Gonna see what life is all about
But word, true, word, you have no man?
No one to share your spotlight or your plans?
Now I'm ready to front for you (front for you)
Visions of us, I'm wanting you (wanting you)

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you, come on

[Verse 2: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Looking at your face, your'e no betting man
Watch my poker play expose your hand
Them cats sitting out in the caravan
Watching me and you walk, baby grins
'You know them cats?' "Nah. Who they is?"
Ebonically, you runnin' off at the jibbs
Got to my house, checked the messages
Some cat talkin' 'bout (ya didn't know)
Now is this what is meant to be
When we try to live more comfortably? (come on)
Making these advances all in vain
It seems that you don't recognize the name
All I really wanted was making you mine
Addition to my world so we could shine
Why didn't you tell me you had some plans?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Had a man, had some plans
Had a man, had some plans...
