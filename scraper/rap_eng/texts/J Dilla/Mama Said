(Verse 1: Robert Mavro)

Mama said listen don't speak
& mama said think but don't preach
My mama also said 7 days without prayer makes one weak
But I'm, steady questioning my failing faith
No I ain't anticipating Judgement Day
I pray the Lord my soul to take
But would he look upon me like we would to an unfamiliar face?
This is the question that puzzle me on a daily
But I'll never play with fire, not tryna get tight with Hades
Mama also said not to every deny your feelings
But don't you know denial's just a river running through Egypt?
I watched her face light up and her smile was kinda revealing
Thinking: "I raised a witty boy thank God he ain't an ediat
Please God make him an achiever" didn't raise no fool
For 12 years I witnessed thanking God for my stay in school
Mama said a lot but the message remained the same
All of this imprinted on my brain
Still she sounding like..

(Chorus: Vanessa Hartley)
Break your leash but don't go far
Cos you've got a lot to learn
Got a lot to lose, and you're still my son
I trust, I'm proud of, delight and I love you
Now go find your own truth

(Verse 2: Robert Mavro)

Missed calls avoidance apparent
Misused, lonely, embarassed
Are emotions felt by girls my eyes loved but heart hasn't
They couldn't envision, ambition they couldn't fathom
Their minds dazzled by angles of what, Mavro was planning
Although, they were established Mama's words lost importance
As I found myself airing signs approaching women without caution
Without pausing, or thinking, or stalling
I've already played the game trust me man I have out thought 'em!
At this time you caught me reminiscing 'bout everything!
From chillin' with the people mama said I shouldn't be dwellin' with
From dreaming of these yards mama said she'd one day settle in
Mama's words I won't be forgetting quick!
I smile when I remember Mama's words and I Wretch 32 slogan it
(Ahh Yeah! haha..)
