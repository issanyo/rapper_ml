Shout-Outs

They call me A-F-R-O, the smooth operator
Uh, smooth operator
Afrodite, A-F-R-O Samurai, A-F-R-O black guy, A-F-R-O mic murderer

This to all my brothers out there
Yes

Uh, if I fucks with you, and you my brother, you 'gon hear yourself
(Check it out, check it out)

I am masterous, rap hazardous
Eradicated black magic that I have with pens
I be draggin' that pencil on the pad and lift
The damn hash and spliff, damn aneurysms
Man, after spliffin', I relax and chill
Throw on an instrumental, get my mental right with skill
I just vibe and chill, eye skies and build
Throw on some Pharoahe Monch, Common, and some Cypress Hill
Let my mind just feel rhymes, it's time to ill
My nigga Irwin, spit a couple rhymes you feel
My brother Cepta spittin' weapons when he settlin' frees
In Heaven and seas, can you pass the medicine, please?
Pass it to my brother, Joshua, he solid with brew
He got the spark, too, that's my brother, Solitude
Mad Flow has flow, one-half of Dino Circle
M.U.T.T. crazy as a motherfucker, (A-yo, that's my brother!)
Whenever Trol need back-up, got the Timberlands on
Gloves, a switch-blade, serrated, we is kin and that's all
My brothers, Blind Toxic, DQ, leave you in acid
Bleed you, and that's it, Blind is an evil beat master
Beauty Under Guidance of Soul, my brother Alex
Took me in this rap thang, without him, I wouldn't manage
I flow with magnets, chose to unfold the madness
My best track was Anthem, produced by Pulse Reaction
His views on all the tracks he loots is always damage
Nigga Nate Evans, rocketship flows, call him NASA
A fan of Detter, (Mr. Brudda!) Hammer smashin' niggas
Write each other rhymes in text messages, then we send em
Speakers in my room, man, I'm blastin' them on
Lookin' down my Facebook, I see Kasper the Ghost
I check out THC, and it's actually gold
A cool movie motherfucker that can actually flow
My brother from an Arabic mother, my brother Naseem
Tryin' to reach his dream, studying this hip-hop thing
I see him improving every time he shows me lyrics
I love the passion in his heart, I love the fact that he's serious
And actually he is a damn natural leader
Shout-out to my nigga, T-Note, he reachin' there
Uh, I fume, loathe, and let go
One of my bigger niggas, Hugo Pacheco
I know big niggas, Samoan Junior and Richie Goku
Flow sick enough to leave comatose niggas with nightmares
Right here, I have to shout-out my brother
My main one, who has a monster just floating
He calls him Moey, Monster Moey is his name
He made a song about me, I had to repay the favor
I'm done reading this verse
I paint a picture, and give my nigga Geo the earth

Ayo, shout-out to my nigga, Johnny Be
(Ayo, Truth) My nigga Kamran, (O.G. Art) Anayltiks see

Smooth Operator

Soon, I'ma get 'em and ravel 'em
Doin' a shootin' within of a caliber
Coopin' and losin' up all of the stamina
Who in the hell are you tryna challenge, dude?

Uh, little' flavor for your ear
Uh, listen
A-F-R-O

I'm the hardest of the hardest, and the smartest of the smartest
I'm the artist with the knowledge, spittin' bars, kickin' off it
Kick it proper, Moey speaking spoken words
Like my third mixtape, spit a verse, saliva regurgitated
Be murderous, beat vermin to each purpose
I'm a scene burglar, keep servin' a mean sermon
I'm a mean person, like Mean Joe Green
Each flow reach emcee, the peace be growing
You better use your brain, steppin' to Professor's terrain
Addressin' the play, best when the wesson is sprayed
Not the gun itself, I'm talking bullets with impact
The shell shock of genius reach you faster than ten Mac's
Ya bitch swallow Big Mac's, lookin' like Hobbits
Shook up the wallets, bumpin' some Christopher Wallace
Nigga, I'm conscious, been rockin' Common and Tribe, yo
Let it be known, Guru's my hip-hop idol, so, um...

I'm a smooth operator
Uh, I'm a smooth operator, get it?
Uh, I'm a smooth operator
Hah, I'm a smooth operator, get it?

Yo, I'm a smooth operator
Hah, I'm a smooth operator, yo
Uh, I'm a smooth operator
Who's A-F-R-O?

He's a smooth operator
