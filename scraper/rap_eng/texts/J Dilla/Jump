[Intro]
Aye

[Verse 1]
This beat spoke to me
Thinking bout my life and what the next move posed' to be
100 dollars for pocket cash and gas money mama I'm forever grateful
Re-up on groceries, never dealt in coca leaf
Smoke a tree and make the world feel my potency
Wake up early in the mornin' like a groundskeeper
In Ghana women sweep concrete, in bare feet
What make you think I give a fuck about some worn-down adidas
In high school never got the new sneakers
Rardyrard bought me my first pair of speakers
Aye
I can never forget what that nigga done for me
For all my niggas that ain't never givin' up on me
Until my mama can sit at home and live comfortably-
I beat these beats up until the law comes for me
PPA done took my shit reported stolen car
Until you know yourself nobody gon' know who you are
Imma
Black star trapped from my black thoughts
Taken from a gold throne
Haunted by my dad's flaws
Todays' the day you be present and let go of the past
Who would of known we make a livin' off a chicken scratch
I mean, Damn!
Can a nigga just create for the rest of his life
We all know what being broke feel like
But what's worse to know how to be free and never try
No Parachutes, Yeah

[Chorus]
My nigga jump! (jump)
And don't you ever look down
What you want? (what you want?)
You betta get that shit now!

[Verse 2]
These days I wanna speak in person
Honestly I rather talk through these verses
Reversing curses, need a girl imperfectly perfect & curvy like cursive
This gotta be worth it
If you stand by my side you gotta earnin’
Keep it straight up with me I don’t need a permin’
Once I got yah heart ain’t no receipt returnin’
I mean that honey
No big dreams no action, that don’t make no money
There’s a bunch of people out here ready to take that from me
CNN & Fox News want us all like Rodney
But nah... this a different narrative completely
Ctrl, alt, delete key yah whole memory
Smoke weed and sip tea with a Genevieve
Big appetite, fat boys gotta eat
Walk barefoot like Akeem with flowers at my feet
I’m a King nigga
Yes Miyekow, make the name ring nigga
First the fat boys break up now Kanye and Jigga
Hope all is well
The throne needs help, it don’t polish itself
I’m am the one


[Chorus]
My nigga jump! (jump)
And don't you ever look down
Nigga what you want? (what you want?)
It's time to get that shit now (nox x3)

You betta jump (x3)
