Verse 1 (Kacpa)
Hearin' all this information
Got me thinkin' it's just the In-formation
And I'm different talkin' innovations in my ventilations
Want it now no patience, that's bad
It match my bitch mixing strands like a lab
Keep your mind open, Like my tab
And I light it, Make it lucid, Call it glass
See through you, look at my class
We awl valedictorians
Eyes on some orients
Say that the glory ends then we deafth
Feel it in my chest
Exhale them cold flows
When it snows roll it and I fold
Into Earth, Then I pop out like birth
Mixin' syrup, Make ya eyes tear up
Tryin' ta tour Europe
Get more for my Euro
Yo, Yo, Where's the beer do...

Verse 2 (Antt)
Yo...
I'm stackin' papers
And livin' my life just like a G
And if you speak more than you actions than ya ass is weak
My team be splitin' blunts, just like a widows peak
Don't even mess with my team that shit will get you beat
Fine women and champagne, now that's a fancy combo
I love the Spanish girls who love to fuckin' do the mambo,
Make sure you do it all today but you can sleep tomorrow
But if you wanna go to bed your friend looks good to borrow..

I'm rollin up this medical
I make these bitchs' pussies edible
Screamin' mutha fuck the federal
Trynna take my baby girl
But I'm never gonna let her go
Thanks why I'm always blown' hella smoke
Smoke SMOKE smoke smoke
I'm smokin' so much weed
My soul be takin' so much my body THCeed
I've got a masters degree
In scrolling up some doobies
Touchin' bitchs' boobies
And gettin' hella nudies
