[Intro:]

This is gonna feel good

[Verse 1: Astin Mcleod]

We went from kisses sweeter than wine is
To getting pissed on like hydrants
When I try and reflect upon my life I'm reminded
To let my soul glow after my passion ignites it
I have the power to change the world; we all do
I could be seen as a modern day Jesus spreading the gospel
Or being hostile with an iron fists like bobby digital
Ben Parker's wise words echo in my mind kinda mystical
An habitual criminal for stealing biblical's
But that's what makes me an apostle
And I know that if my approch is sleepy hollow
Then it's possible to control our own cosmos
And wander how I climbed up to this scale
If we're brave enough to lead our lives like we can't fail
We can create the world around us and break out of our mental jails
A simple tail, with dental whales, frails, and rental yales
I turned my fear of the unknown into curiosity
Now the only thing that can stop me is pomposity
And that probably won't happen even if I try
Because even though I'm rapping I'm still a humble guy

Rest in Peace J Dilla

[Verse 2]

And I encourage you all to do the same
Don't allow your mind to be confined to be a slave
Keep your minds eye open and know that when you have faith
There's nothing that lips of wine can't remind you to obtain
So go forth in the world grab her by the femeral muscle
Speak your mind even if you find federal trouble
Decisions you make hold weight like an elephants doubled
An elegant struggle, that's ephemeral like bubbles
