[Intro]

[Verse 1: Sir Macsamillion]
Money ministries, got me worshipping the Lord of dollars
Make yo main dame holler
And you know she want me 'cus the flow tighter than a ziplock
Better stare in the mirror and watch your mouth before you get popped
I'm all in for this music shit you feel me
And if you can't accept that, then shoot me and kill me 'cus
I know my soul going to where Michael live now
Your girl calling me baby, I wear a bib now
But I'm bouta kick her to the curb
She talking about kids now
Rather sit in my room, record music, and make beats
And slip up somewhere in between the sheets
I got destiny, out of me, and my sis
I'm the younger child you see
If I could describe my childhood, I'd say ShamWow
Soaking this game up, 'till I get famous, just like Amos
But, I ain't tryna be known for packaging cookies
But just from making this music and money and killing some pussy, nigga

[Hook]
Get on your job you be hustling all night
But I still get more money when I'm on my 9-5
Niggas fill their rhymes up with 94 lies
But your 94 lines can't match one of mine

[Verse 2: $pidey Tha God]
Now we the reason these hoes poppin', word to my nigga Dustin
Quick to talk slick with the same mouth that I bust in
Niggas talk shit, but I ain't never with the fussin, I promise
When you see me nigga, you gon' say nothing
Repercussions of being a King, sometimes this world
Don't understand the gift that you bring, sometimes these girls
Don't understand the meaning of Queen
Lost some friends cus they ain't really want to work for the dream
Got a text from past, says I'm in town boy you should come through
Want to spend some time, been awhile since I seen you
Tryna erase the past with words you don't mean fully
I'm bouta flip the script just like a buncha movies
You niggas be sending shots but I don't feel it
My skin Teflon, spit Napalm, got the world in my palm
I'm a (t-t-t-t-) ticking time bomb
Smooth as mughfuckah, don't leave me round yo moms nigga

[Hook]
(repeat 2x)
[Verse 3: Teiji Mack]
Used to skip rocks on the birds, while Larry watched the Lakers play
In between that's a play for the come-up of the best team in the NBA
No one never taught me bought the birds n the bee's
Prolly 'cus I was fly as the birds, and would converse with the trees
Tryna directly study the sun gave me grandpa vision before I even hit 13
But now I'm leaving my teens, I'm just a little thirsty, and hungry for knowledge
So I could figure why every woman I liked, never liked a nigga back
Unless you count Senior Year, still have my doubts about that
Still wishing for some TLC, and a chick who'll sing me All That
Girl, leave your blanket of security, and cuddle under my cover
Nevermind, 'cus saps are just for tree's or pancakes
And flipped like mirror reciprocals
Comes out great, or just the same
There's power in my name, righteous Mack, talking smack to the pimphand's game

[Vamp]
An overload, I'm brain dead
An oversoul like Megaman
Two shots to ya chromosome you brain dead
Wonder when your load will end, you hang ten
Let it overflow like rain, man
(repeat 4x)

[Hook]

{transition into Pineapple Fanta}

[Verse 1: Teiji Mack]
They say the sky is falling but it's just the sun dropping
And we chiling at the cookouts tryna get our soda poppin' like Crush
I can't really talk about my crush, but I be on twitter tryna get in my flirt
And she know I want her, don't really know why I haven't asked her for her number
My courage flossin, like the Wizard of Oz, I swear my flow is just kinda odd
I ain't lying tho, gotta promise to keep it honest, because temptation comes calling
I go so fast, feel like I'm falling
Get masked with Jim in all this
And, rewind the verse back, Playstation get to pausing
You want to fight, you get the paws and, I put that on my name sake, that I ain't bout to get beat
Backpack through the rat traps, we strive hard for countenance
Wonder if my accent can reach different continents
Blow an initial of two L's, next to a J
That's not Cool J, thats just some common sense
Get hit, with the wit in my common pen
Looking for the light 'cus the dark is my countenance
And yeah that's kinda ignorant, if you really got it
She say she wants somebody fly, listen to the Pilot
And girl, I know that I'm mean but
I really wonder how you carry yourself looking like a goddess

[Hook]
Asking for a verse, begging for a hook
Telling me to remember, forgot what you done took
Nigga you lame, nigga you lame, nigga you lame, we peepin your game

[Verse 2: Ron Wise]
Woke up feeling lyrical, wake and bake no cereal
Purp came for breakfast, Newports my refreshments
The chick keep me focused like anti-depressants
I always keep it honest when I answer assessments
You tell me your preference, and know I gotta reference
That I recommend with the upmost deference
When the cake come, then we divide, with severance
If my shit looking short, then I  return for a measurement
Got me a new bit, and just to know, the pussy elegant
She love me 'cus I'm wise, and I love it she's intelligent
Shawty give the best head and she bright red
No stranger to the back seat and friendly in the bed
Smoke a lot of weed, even tho I'm by the feds
Won't tell em my real name the first thing that I said
Remade it's Ron Wise, don't forget, fuck a plan
I got a jet for a mindset, and I ain't slowing up
People getting older but they seldom growing up
I could spill the truth without even pouring a cup
Look into the future, don't just stare at us
Ron Wise

[Hook]
