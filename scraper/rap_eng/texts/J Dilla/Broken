(Intro)
I just feel restricted with you
It’s not like I don’t love you but it is just complicated
And if you love me, if you actually claim to love me
You understand, please just help me to help myself to help you
Yes, please, just try to be understanding

(Verse 1: Yasir)
Looney on the scene baby
Why you wan do me like that, that, that? (Nah fuck it)
Why you wan do me like that, that, that? (Fuck it)
Fucking tired of the cold stories and all the lost glories (And all the lost glories)
Ooh, ama tell your mama on you, ooh, girl you lost your home training
Ooh, ama tell your mama on you, ooh, girl you lost your damn mind
Been using humour do deal with my pain, since 05’
It’s 17’ bout to turn 22 and I’m still a fool (It’s not your fault)
Could never keep a girl, could never keep it cool
But I’ve been smoking to deal with the pain
Warm up my cold heart but shit it just melts
Can’t even, pity myself
But I’m chasing the wealth but catching my tail
Too hard to tell cause there’s nothing to feel
Heart is broken

(Chorus: DX)
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do

(Verse 2: DX)
DX
I thought you loved me, I thought you do
Now I am walking, around for you
You say you want me, now you want two
My baby’s calling, but calling who?
Oh my baby, you know I won’t
Parlour Boyz no dey joke for ya
Mehn we hustling we be smoking all day
Baby where’s my heart bae, tell me where’s my heart bae?
You know I want you, so please don’t go

(Chorus: DX)
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do (I’m sorry)
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do

(Verse 3: Yasir)
How dare you fuck another nigga, while I dey cheat on you?
You thought this was peace? Nah it’s deuces
Letting straw dick niggas sip your pussy juices
Let me leave you with the memory of Looney baby
Off your clothes baby, touch your toes baby
You too wide baby, I can see your heart baby
It ain’t beating for me, I can go acapella
Devil wears Prada so you act like Cinderella
Going savage mode, on my ex bitch
Found a new girl, that was last week
Took a gamble on relationships, playing for a suit life on deck
But I was busy cashing cheques, my obsession with commas
You’re the sentence in my story that never ends (Yeah it never ends)
Me and my niggas on the road with the weed in our mouth, nothing special we’re just heading to the couch

(Chorus: DX)
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do
My heart is broken, my heart is broken
I thought you loved me, I thought you do

(Outro)
I know I promised to love you forever
But , I don’t think I can do it
