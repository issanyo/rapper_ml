[Verse]
Emotional in tokyo
I'm flying in the UFO
I'm riding like a rodeo
I'm lying like Pinocchio
Ethan is you high? Si
Puffing on that Vitamin C
Posting picks
They trying to get the D
Blow my load
Inside of where she pee
My name is eDaddy
You can call me Daddy E
And when I'm cooling with a fatty
On my lap is where she be
Won't catch me sipping on the sizzurp
Maybe a couple swishers
Keeps me cooler than a blizzard
Rapping like an acid tripping lizard
Paint a vivid picture
Of the days I gave away my liver
But nowadays
Twitter keeps me occupied with nonsense
My only plan was getting in her contents
I got this, promise I'm being honest
Starts off with a polish
By the end it gets demolished
The conquest
Uncommon commoner
Wander into his fucking conscience
Ponder on it longer
Only makes me want to vomit
The only way to stop it
Is to top it
Dropping out the cockpit
Rocks inside my pockets
