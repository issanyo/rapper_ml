[Verse 1: Jay Dee]
You ain't gotta play hard to get
I know you, I know you like the art of sex
I'm putting down my plan like a architect
It's for you, and her, we can all get wet
I got alot of nerve talking this to you right
I'm straight up, and this should make sense to you
Girl you ain't gotta front don't be acting dumb
And if you got the goods, then I want some
I'm tryna get down this ain't no la di da
But I ain't never fucked with a menage a trois
It's three like the stripes on the a-di-das
Getting live like we at the mardi gras
We getting live like we at the mardi gras
Three is the magic number ask my part-i-ner
I be serving that ass like a bar-ten-der
I'm only too bold to be watching ya
I'm only too bold to be watching ya

[Hook]
I want you right here in the world
Being with you all alone
It's like a dream's come true

[Verse 2: T3]
See these things get sold
I'm caught up in ya game I'm kinda tango
Maybe it's the way you sed---huuuu on the down-low
Saying things to me that one and 3 would only know
I wanna tell you though that these things seem to mean
Situations keep you from point A to B
I certainly put a counsel on our mistakes
I got a mission on two girls on a hot beach
Everythings a reach and ain't nobody stoppin' me
It just relax me cause they know I gotta plan for each
Hhhhyeah every body know I gotta plan for each
You know I, you know I gotta plan for each

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baatin]
Thought you knew Baatin was polygamist
Which one of you queens is coming to get with this
Already got one holdin' my arm in this
But I need a couple to add to my list
Take a position in my world of compassion
Satisfaction, ecstasy
Calling you calling me
I know you yearning for sexual longevity
My name is Baatin Rasul Rasii
Tantric master, sex, two or three
Ecstacy, calling you calling me
I know your hubby ain't giving you no action
Well for one he's too damn masculine
He need to relax, and take some lessons on givin' you climax
All alone, it's like a dream's come true

[Hook x3]
