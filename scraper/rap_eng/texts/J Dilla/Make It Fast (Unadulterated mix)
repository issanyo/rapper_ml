[Hook: Bun B]
("Make it fast!") You try to step to my flow, you better-
("Make it fast!") You frontin like you got dough, you better-
("Make it fast!") You try to come where I go, you better-
("Make it fast!") Cause man, you already know, you better-
("Make it fast!") You try to step to my flow, you better-
("Make it fast!") You frontin like you got dough, you better-
("Make it fast!") You try to come where I go, you better-
("Make it fast!") Cause man, you already know

[Verse One: Bun B]
It's Bun Beeda, I'm a beast in the booth
I bleed gums and break teeth in the booth
At the least, I'm the truth, on a bad day I sleep the best
Nap, wake up, and sweep the rest
So keep ya vest, I'm domin like an ex-addict
Ya belly's now jelly, ya face full of beet cabbage
Ya flow is not dro homie, you that weak package
And where I'm finna send yo' ass you won't need baggage
We savage like the Wild Wild West
I'm the go flow pro, you the mile style vet
I been doin this since Slay was on the Wildstyle set
All hail to the king or face treason
That's when I slap wack niggas for no reason
And once I take it there, ain't no easin
It's alligator souffle baby, with no seasoning so..

[Verse Two: Termanology]
Uh, waddup Bun? Homie, pass the beer
And make it fast, like Guerilla Black's career
We smokin hash, purple, sour, kush
Gettin high fast like the young George Bush
Uh, I make it fast like a robbery
You take it slow like Monopoly (Drive slow, homie...)
Bitch, I'm Termanology
Straight gangsta, like The Black Donnellys
So many hoes is on top of me
Last thing I'm thinkin about is monogamy (Fuck outta here..)
Specialized in psychology
Numerology, stimulatin the economy
Movin pounds of trees, uh you know the M.O
Trap star generals, whips like Jay Leno
Keep the shit ghetto, countin my cash
This is Law Town, Mass., walk through with ya jewels
You betta MAKE IT FAST~!
