[Intro]
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone
"I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him." Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze

[Hook: GZA]
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump

[Verse 1: JC Assassin]
Troops on the left, keep acting practical
All my niggas steady acting classical
All my niggas steady acting radical
(might wanna bring out some tissues, this tragical)
Man, it's too bad that this beat is flammable
The way I talk about my vibe is magical
I could use slang and then go and slang a bag of dope
Still hopping on the remix of Flying Daggers though
I'm tryna be like the next Method Man
So if I ask if I can kick it you say "yes you can"
Can I kick it?
I almost forgot, ain't nobody hear come to listen
Ghostface, leave it as a cold case
Cold cuts to your face, fuck the showcase
Running so fast, nearly missed the speed bump
Had to speed up, beaten like Roots, no tree stump, all my...

[Hook: GZA]
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump

[Verse 2: Hoshi]
I swear I'd never kill a human, never rob a hotel
Never leave my family behind via a portal
I'd never let a soldier down, go back for the crew
Carry them to safety even if I end up screwed
I could let the wolves attack me or I could run
If I was to save a knight I'd probably be done
Of course I'm a usual suspect even though I didn't do a thing
They think I'm Bryan but I just wanna sing
And this is just one of the many street stories
The street all wanna kill me, but I just want glory
They think I'm like Jane Toppan, but I don't wanna be her
My grandma was in hospital, I wish I could've seen her

[Hook: GZA]
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump

[Verse 3: gamemast15r]
I pop shots like I cop Glocks
Incognito in the drop tops
You know me, I'm gonna stock rock
This shit is the Ill Street Blues
This shit will send you to hell, you know I'll see you soon
Your shit's frail, I'm gonna leave your diseased knees to
See Deagles, pop pop
I don't understand, you motherfuckers speak hebrew
You're scared of the KS, I can hear your hearbeat
You be lookin' shook like when you were sittin' in your carseat
Kane Soze, like you know your pain is what you owe me
You phony, your blood on your shirt, will be the motif
Cold crease into the tip of your skull
Ain't no blood spillin' unless the crips are involved
I'm not one but you know either way that the clips will get called
You know that you're the biggest snitch of them all
And there ain't no way in hell that your sins'll absolve

[Hook]

[Last Verse: The Deevil's Advocate]
I have a particularly violent propensity, with a dense sense of dependency; you could say I enjoy it
Rapid grab of acid tabs and whip-its, then I grab a spike strip and deploy it
Pulling innocents from their conveyances on a quiet night time pass
Drag em’ back to the domicile in the wilderness and let out a laugh
Dismember em’ alive, pull bits, spitting images reflected in my mental pictograph
Bottle entrails, which entails the rest of the innards and viscera go in the freezer
Hiking trails double as a charnel house for thram and gobbet minutia at my leisure
Forensics and cleaners with tweezers, gripping a loose sneaker, I tease with meager evidence
Have unbelievers dreaming, demeanor of an eager deceiver with rampant brain fever pestilence
Every Caesar had his Brutus, thus, one time, one city guy tried to shake me down, shylocking
I beat his cranium in until it was a pulpy cavern of brain matter—needless to say he wasn’t profiting
Hitherto, never knew he was a made man, a connected guy, then I got a letter from the other side
The administration fancied my handy work with a pack of G’s because I whacked a capo
A couple crews and outfits saw it fit to confirm me in the waste management business; a Soprano
Of course I was obligated to omit an orchestral ode to the Omertà
Now my hankering for mob blood stems deeper, feasting on an inferior vena cava or aorta
The nefarious Nosferatu of the Cosa Nostra
Novos Ordo Seclorum, Alucard’s incarnate proxy, whom he’s the host of
Leave you, wrists slit bathing with a toaster
Vengeful vera causa
Aura unearthed a killer hibernating underneath necropolis
Trash bags of calling cards, just a garbage business to the populous
Message jobs, you heard it through the horse head’s mouth
Scattered teeth in a lake, a rat left for the vultures
Spring cleaning the block, asphalt’s probably coated with a couple cultures
Chalking and yellow taping the Brick Road of the same name
And in the same vein, we draining cowards lying and melting snitches ablaze
Load up and clip em', ripping through casings like flesh
Advocating devilry by the books, closed family business in a mesh
Heavy hitter, mobbed up, cocked hammer blacker than an anvil
Bellowing flames, sulfur rings engraved in my cleaver’s handle
Crew captains eating alone pay tribute one way or another
Flying higher than their burning rafters off crank and hydro as I hover
Burying marks alive, monkey wrenches beating down Mafia mistresses in rain and thunder
Doubled up stained mattresses; taking it to our rivals, as I revel in their broken stutters
RICO keeping down all that racket, dons slinging ten large to tie loose ends getting pinched
From mugshots to search teams, spread your limbs over five states, inch by inch
That Program can’t protect what it can’t witness, Kerosene coats and lighters
I darken shadow groups, duplicitous; every city sector is connected like a surge protector
Plugging cops in like a coaxial, no outlet, cornered at the corner mercantile and merked at ten
Envelopes and brief cases dropped off, whilst I literally drop em’ off—I’m rooftop high on Percocet
No skyscraper nets, just city workers scraping off what landed on the skyline silhouette
Squad cars disintegrated, inundated the hospital with patients intubated, vehicles left on the train tracks
Other soldiers aren’t aware of the trophies and mementos I keep, hope they don’t check under those loose tacks
Finger necklaces and muscle scarfs, scarred the memories of any task force raid attacks
My lurid proclivities leave me straying from the course, pouring gas on a prostitute carcass
Heaving harlots into the passenger seat, blood stains on the glove box compartment
Can’t part myself from this irreparable addiction, midnight delusions have me tearing up floor boards
Death watches me, I see it’s eyes
Carving the walls with ice picks and steak knives, malodorous aroma of formaldehyde and land lords
I’ve spilt enough blood lines for this family, hopefully that’ll preserve my lineage
Single handgun shot echoes
