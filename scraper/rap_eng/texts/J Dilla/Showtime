[Intro]
Uh, yeah, it's showtime
It's showtime, yeah
Feel the magic and soul of the YB's, yeah

[Chorus]
It's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime

Uh, check it...

[Verse 1]
You can't miss YB number 2 in that yellow and blue
Your eyes be on my shoes when I drive by you
You can't see me but I see you
Not to any degree should you fear I-L-L-A-space-J is here
I'm sensational, extra exceptional, extraterrestrialistic
I'm at the top of the key slashing through your paint
Like you broke my girl's car window
Don't be surprised when you see how far we go
Whoop your ass on the road, shoulda made your free throws
My fault, is the squeaking of my shoes too loud?
Well, it's part of the sport
I gotta make noise when I cruise through crowds
Uh, and quit bitchin' 'bout the calls
That's why you choking, choking on my balls
Ah-ha, you let me psyche you out
Kiss kiss, bang bang, now I knocked you out

[Chorus]
It's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime

Yo, uh...

[Verse 2]
Yo, my style is sangria, get done over
I take the needle and scratch your ass, spin, fast break
No look pass, skyhook, no cash in the bank
Only pounds 'cause I shoot all net
Yeah, we coming back, put down your bet
Uh, yeah, you gon' regret
And pay me respect, I can detect
Many biters, y'all ain't players, y'all ain't writers
Put down the pen
You can't even get a number without your friends
And without the Benz, on the other hand
I could score at will so force me left and get left
While I lift in the air, and release
Uh, and all sound is deceased
It's John, son, and Big Game James, yeah

[Chorus]
It's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime, it's showtime
It's showtime, it's showtime
