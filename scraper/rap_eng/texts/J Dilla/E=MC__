[Intro: Common + scratched voices]
Yeah, let's go, turn it up
Introducin' World Famous Beat Junkies
J. Rocc
Here's the sound and substance of the world's hottest entertainment
Yeah, uh
Let's pause for a moment
I got my man with me

[Verse 1: Common]
Get up get up, and rock, and rock
The hump the hump, it knock it knock
You out the atmosphere
This rap here is something that I felt in the moment
Of truth, opponents in the booth
Inspired, is what I write, it's fire like 'roof'
They say that I'm as hot as the block is
I say that I'm as cold as the dark is
Narcs hid in the cut
Tryin' to get my nigga in the gut
He rolled by, holdin' Stony up
Poking his Chest like Cody Nutt
Smoking his cess, he blow it up
As it escapes out the window
I'm a symbol of sex, revolution and Tecs on the deck
When niggas shoot for extra loot and respect
Live and direct effect from the C-O double
Get your paper, we stay up out of trouble, nigga
Get up

[Bridge: J Dilla]
Stand up, throw you fuckin' hands up
If you got the feelin', jump up, touch the ceilin'
Get, get, get up get up
Get get get, get, get up, get up yeah
Get up, stand up throw you fuckin' hands up
If you got the feelin', jump up, touch the ceilin'
Get, get, get up get up
Get get up, get, get up, get up, get up yeah
Get up, stand up, throw you fuckin' hands up
If you got the feelin', jump up, touch the ceilin'
Get, get, get up get up
I get get, get up, get up yeah

[Verse 2: Common]
Get up niggas, get live ladies
Since the early 80's I rock the planet daily
Radio Rashid, this is how I do when I write things
The party for your right to fight scenes
Baby girl you as young as the night seems, in tight jeans
Should it be Kahlua or ice cream?
My pipe dream's as long as the fight scenes in The Matrix
Scorpio rising, sex fiend by nature
Try to control that shit so my soul don't get
Dirty for some girly unworthy of the flowers
I admit that I got strange powers
Brain Towers like the Eiffel, Leaning through life cycle
Hold the Bible and a rifle
They can't do me like Mike though
Give me the spotlight and turn the lights low
Make me wanna holler like crew how a Jew yell disciple
Streets streets, beats beats, vibes, rhymes, and life, joe
Get up

[Outro: J Dilla]
There it is, it's like that
Yup, yeah know how we do it
