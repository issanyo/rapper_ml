[Verse 1: Just]
He walks around with his pants lower than my self esteem
He's on that nicotine, and all he had was dreams
Throw the stub, and all we see is another fiend
Darker demons in the denim of his Truey jeans
Another hopeless smoker is all that we'd assume to see
A different Justin is what I would know he's soon to be
I told 'em choose a side, knowing he wasn't choosing me
I asked him "suicide?", knowing he wasn't suing me
Yeah, well at least for now the kid is sober
But his wrist is looking redder than the Red October's
Says, that he hadn't slit a vertical since last October
And, if his mindset never changes that's his last October
Cause if he cuts as deep as Edgar Allen then its over
Looks at life just like a game, he found a new controller
Yeah, yeah, he found his new controller
Treating life just like a game, he found his-fuck it

[Hook]
Time to save the world
Bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2: Just]
It's not like he does it and all of a sudden he's glad, it's
That he's doing all this "I can't tell my dad" shit
Wait,  "even at the thought of it, my mom is mad" shit
It might sound and look like nothing, but dog it's mad shit
Light up his life, yea?
He's got better use for matches
He's got a girlfriend, but doesn't know where the match is
Lines of longe and latitude up on his axis
Can you go ahead and please point him to where an axe is?
Claims "I'm doing me, and fuck whoever's asking
I'd rather cut myself, than cut all of their classes
Swallow the truth for what, just pass a piece of glass it's
What I need in order for me to go end it mad quick"
Just watch him vanish as if it's magic
Oh you don't find it tragic? At least he's passing, yeah
But in what motherfuckin' way though?
I got quotes that you could toy with, like they was Platos

[Outro]
