[Verse]
Get ready to watch yo kin boil
You finna be in soil
I'm mad I don't no blunts, but I got a water bottle with tin foil
I'll still get my high
I hit the lye jet and fly
I'm so ill yo hero started to cry, when he met this guy
Check this method shout out to Lord Finesse
Don't front yo career you can't afford to mess
I spit ill when I'm sober and when I mix the vocal cord with sess
I spit that sharp shit
I drop a hard hit and it'll be sold in every market
My war kit, will spread you like piss on a carpet
You better protect yo neck
I'll infect yo deck
My hand will connect with the tech
I'll put that ass in check if you disrespect and then I'll fuckin wreck
These dope bars fiends select and inject in a muthafuckin sec
