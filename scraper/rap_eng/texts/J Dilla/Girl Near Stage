[Verse 1: Raw Elementz]

She stood around 5'3, always looking at me
When I'm on stage in front where she gon be, then she approached me
Why you always lookin' past me, but I'm not lookin' past you I'm lookin' past you
By past you, I mean I'm lookin in your past boo, so don't put this past you
This conversation past due, she said what you mean?
That was a clever way of sayin I'm trying to get into them jeans
I know you love my poetic genes, is what it seems, I'm just tryna get you to seaman like Marines
And you got them cakes like Geez, I'm tryna get into them sheets, and rap to you indians like Chiefs
So I'mma make this brief, as I drop my briefs, and you drop your panties, I'm on G's
Which means I'm on time, so we can do this thing but after I'm back to the grind
Back to get mine, what you got in mind, we can do it slow or fast never mind
I beat the garfield to it yields, bust that shit open to I hear it squeal
Let's make a deal, no emotions or feelings, had you layed out looking at the ceiling
In a daze, she couldn't walk straight in some days, had her lost for words got her mouth amazed
Left before she wake, no words were spoken, rolled a tight joint now I'm floatin
Thinkin back on a sly mission, and another dope song was written

[Hook]

Anchor flow I get down on these hoes, and then I write it down in my flows x8
