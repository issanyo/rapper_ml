[Verse]
Seventeen...
Crazy how we just getting older
I finally got my mind open, but still can't find no closure
I'm thinking bout' downing a bottle cause what's the point of being sober?
Get inside the ride hop onto i-75 and hit bout 99
I'm looping, roller coasters
Pills and overdoses
Dreams spilled and all that's left were shriveled roses
I can't even bare this
Petals on the box and tear stains from pallbearers
Look
I'm tearing up from spilled memories
6 years and I ain't do shit
Death, depression, broken hearts, and almost cleared a clip
I'm lost
No cash
I seen my way to heaven and one time I almost dashed
But I hit the brakes
Gun in hand, head of Chase
Finger on the trigger then I pictured momma's face...
The Intro...
Tell the story...
Yeah...
