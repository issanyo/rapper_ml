Virtues and Vices
Sweeteners and spices
I found the American Pie
Now Im getting my slices
The firms raising they prices
Its a new age crisis
Decade long recession
Got me feeling like Tyson, Mayweather, Pacqui√°o-NO
So smooth Pac's piano
Higher than Kilamanjaro
Mountain peaks through the clouds
Im high off life
Not from the sticky or the loud
Like a post it note
Yo I'm sticking around
Virtues & Vices
Melodies & sounds
From pesos to pounds
Down in Londontown
The old mainstream is the new underground
Let your love abound
Just let it adorn
I cry when you weep
I weep when you mourn
Asleep in the morn'
Awake through the day
Virtues & Vices
What a price to pay
Life is good, life is good
Something nice to say
Teaching lessons
With Smith & Wessons
And maybe AKs
Violence isnt the answer
It's hard to wrestle with but Ma'
You gone beat cancer
Downplaying it
Saying your friend is just a dancer
Sister she's a stripper
Virtues & Vices
As the next man tips her
She starts to likes it
He looks deep in her
Eyes and realize its his daughter
He never raised
Karma always returns
Its always pays
Virtues & Vices, Vices & Virtues
The truth will set you free and I ain't tryna hurt you....
