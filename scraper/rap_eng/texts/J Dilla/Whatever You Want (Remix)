[Chorus: N'dea Davenport]
Whatever you want
My heart I’ll give you gladly
Whatever you want
I love to keep you laughing
Whatever you want
If you want my love just ask me
Whatever you want
I know I make you happy

[Verse 1: N'dea Davenport]
I been trying to tell you
That my heart begins to swell
When I see you passing by my way
And baby you can’t imagine
What I’m saving just for you
I wanna let you know
Exactly how I feel
I keep dreaming about
How high our love could soar
I’ll write your name in my heart
Our love would never part

[Chorus: N'dea Davenport]
Whatever you want
My heart I’ll give you gladly
Whatever you want
I love to keep you laughing
Whatever you want
If you want my love just ask me
Whatever you want
I know I make you happy


[Verse 2: N'dea Davenport]
Maybe if you knew
That I been playing it so cool
Cause I been waiting patiently just for you
But maybe you’ve got someone at home
That’s sitting right there
But I don’t care, I don’t care, no, no
I keep thinking about
How high our love could soar
I’ll write your name in the sky
Romance will be our guide

[Chorus: N'dea Davenport]
Whatever you want
My heart I’ll give you gladly
Whatever you want
I want to keep you laughing
Whatever you want
I want you in the right way
Whatever you want
I’ll hold on just to you baby

[Chorus: N'dea Davenport]
Whatever you want
My heart I’ll give you gladly
Whatever you want
I want to keep you laughing
Whatever you want
My love is for the taking
Whatever you want
My love for you is waiting
