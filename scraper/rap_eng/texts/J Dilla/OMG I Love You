[Verse 1]
Some things you do and say
Make the hard things in life go away
I watch you sparkle and show me the light
And I know everything will be all right

I take your hand and you lift me off the ground
And our laughter is like a singular sound
Your pixie dust on steroids
Your marvelous
Life sparkles when you're around

So please don't ever
Ever go away
I'll bring you breakfast in bed
Every single day

I'll draw your bath
And make your tea
Whatever it takes
To keep you happy with me

[Chorus]
Cause OMG I love you!
OMG it's right
If ever there were a term for this
It's OMG tonight

[Verse 2]
I want to do things that I've not ever did
I want to run wild and I'm not even scared
So tell me true are you feeling it too?
Does your sparkle rise when you look in my eyes?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bring me to life
Bring me to love
I wanna know
What you're thinking of

You make me shine inside and out
I wanna know what you're thinking about

Like the century sun
You make my systems run
All I feel is light
You make it so bright

[Chorus]

I wanna draw all over the words?
I wanna follow the trail that comes
I wanna climb the trees and swim in the seas
Come light it up with me

Like a supernova
And power takes me over
Like the century sun
I think you're the one (I think you're the one)

[Chorus]
