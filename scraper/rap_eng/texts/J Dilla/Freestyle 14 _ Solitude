[Verse 1: Spitty]
I'm doing this off the top off the dome like the Sky and
They had to change the name now we calling like Verizon
I hate the corporates they got me all buying
Consumer grade condition how I'm feeling like I'm dying
Trapped in a closet full of clothes where I'm rapping
Back in my bedroom now you know what's happening
Gotta keep it slapping, never did no trapping
Maybe just a little on the side for the cash in
Ha, I'm feeling so fly I ain't worried 'bout a thang
Nah I'm coming in nice, I ain't never skip a beat
I just do it real tight, If they coming with a left
Never see me on the right
I go Pushing on like Terry
Hey, I been working for the dairy
Hey, Derri√®re oh Mary
Hey, life's a chase Tom & Jerry

[Hook: Spitty]
See me in the city I been running
Coming like I seen it all go
High up in the moment I been tripping
Never see me feeling so low
See me in the city I been running
Coming like I seen it all go
Lights turned red I been gunning
Never see me feeling so low

[Verse 2: Spitty]
Look at me look at me it's just masterpieces
Magic like a rabbit out the hat we screeching
I could take it back to triceratops and fetus
Like a modern day rhino I'm macho my nose be so gino
-rmous, no I don't ever miss
I never seen Pluto it's so far and gorgeous
I hope I make it one day space and the cosmos
You dumb like Cosmo, I'm wandering
Get it, nah you sleeping, boy you tiny like Timmy
My flow is silly, a dilly it back like Pickle, it's all fickle
We rug rats too many tugging my back, oh
It's funny how it goes
They never thought that I would take it this far no no
I never thought that I would make it this long no no
I never thought that I would ever get this high no no (oh no)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spitty]
Livings only difference is time
The way I see it seem like our vision decide
Dead or alive I never took no vengeance for pride
Man I might end it just to sentence all this hell that's inside
I feel abysmal, dismal, loaded up the pistol
Bodies drop like flies around me pray for we do miss you
I sing the saddest songs never sung why the good die young what the pain must've brung
To them, I wish I could've done for them, oh what I would've done for them
Strike like lightning how a rope so frightening or a blade bright red like it cut through icing
I been vicing, play it off the dices, roll a four five with a six so I'm lighting up
Runaway from rain where the writing's tough
Chuck a deuce to confuse all them biting much
Why they biting huh, no really why you biting huh?
I'm on a pattern past parameters my attributes are radical my radiance is riveting my prowess is unmatchable they asking how he spit this way it's something like parabolas I'm up and then I'm down curving in and out of these characters
To be factual I'm actually a genius
So magical the devil is so devious
No heaven for me don't believe in Jesus
I been swimming so lonely in the deep end
In the water with the sharks and the whales and the dolphins
In the darkness, with the ghouls and the ghosts and the goblins
I'm a lost kid

[Outro]
It goes la la la la la
Searching for all of you
La la la la la
Searching for my solitude
La la la la la
Searching for all of you
La la la la la
Searching for my solitude
