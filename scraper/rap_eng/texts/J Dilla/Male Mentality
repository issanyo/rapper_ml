[Verse 1: Keenan The First]

Girl if I told you I'm scared
And I am underprepared
To be there for you
My smile is a front (ah)
I hug you to put the knife in your back
And I just cleared out the trunk
We'll probably break up at the end of the month
My homies see me and they call me the man when they drunk
I look in the mirror and I see a punk
Nobody listening to me
(hey) Happiness a magician it keep on tricking on me
(Oh) Missionary the worst she keep on kissing on me
(Oh) But I'm getting lonely
A month pass and we still together
Ask me if I love her and the answer's still forever
My lil' piece I'm a settle down and build the cheddar
It's no beef we are purely leather
You can't hide...
(You can't hide from this truth you finna get it boy)
You can't hide from all the relevancy
The room is printed in elephant's feet
Something telling me
"Don't split, you grown and you owe that chick"
But they taught me how to divide back in elementary
I'll take the chance she don't find no one better than me
I could move on by pedaling feet
But I don't cuz I love her
I mean cuz I want her
I mean cuz I own her
She like my greatest possession
Power's not just a game
It's like my greatest obsession
And when I see another man on my property
I'll be using a weapon
Pleading the second
I ain't afraid to teach you this lesson
I got the chalk out
(Chalk out for you while you talking)
Ain't nothing we can talk bout
(Whoop I ain't talking  bout it)
Park the whip and I hop out
(Hopping out the whip on you)
If there's two options I opt out
(Opting out to flip on you)
Cuz I'm a swing for the knockout
(Whoop Swinging for the knock knock)
Step back baby not know
Not now..

This ain't about you
