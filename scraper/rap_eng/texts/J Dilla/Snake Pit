So much in this could've gone wrong
But then I would've never known right
So many of my favorite people are long gone
Everyone dies, but I never knew they'd go like
They all did. When I grow up, I'll be a tall kid
Probably still be complaining about what's wrong with
Myself. Dodging suicide by belt
Time heals all when you buy the lies that time sells
For someone who doesn't, I'm getting by well
Thoughts set the parameters in which I define hell
Tried to climb to a height where I could live right, but my foot slipped from the support, and I fell
Down to a bottom, laid as it dismissed me
Waiting for that Frisbee, to come back. It glides swell
In a bed, my sedation level's risky cause
Lately I been sick see, my blood is lacking white cells
Tried everything a doctor told me might help
Sent chemicals to where my insight dwells
Yeah they last for a moment, but my ghastly opponent is a disease. I'm feeling like I might yell
The people I trust don't tell me much
Walking through this life like I got impaired knees but
In my sleep, when I dream I can smell freedom
In that world, boundaries are what I fell free from
Don't believe there's an exit from my kingdom
I don't believe in miracles because I've never seen one
It's hard to put the effort into walking down the mountain, when there's a perfectly good cliff to leap from
It seems some are unable to handle the truth
Quickly transitioning from wearing sandals to boots
No matter what I'm walking through, I'm not a philosopher just a man with thoughts that stands in a booth
I'm demanding the truth where I trace my memory from
Emerge from the shelter of it like a centipede does
I never knew who my enemy was
My thoughts taught me, that it lives inside the head of me cause
I've never been one to listen to another person
Gave up happiness so I could discover worth in
The lower trenches of life. I know regrets'll ignite when doing wrong with no intention of right
One way, continuing a lone descent to the light
Struggle pays, even when no one mentions it might
That's how I found this. And since then I've been astounded that no one told me my words were meant for a mic
These words are meant for you Mike, your loss has still got me shaken
Since you no longer can, I'm gonna strive for greatness
Now I know where the snakes live
Dumping gas in, and chucking matches in the snake pit
