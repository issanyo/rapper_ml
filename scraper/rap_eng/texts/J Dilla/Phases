Hook:

Phases, I've seen too many faces, been to
Many places. Gone through fucking mazes. (x4)


Verse 1:

I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I'm feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Running through mazes
Everybody has they fuckin' phases, uh
Everybody has they phases, uh (x2)
Vibe to this, bad bitch in the whip when I
Drive to this and you feelin' it uh
I been at it for a minute and I ain't never gon'
Quit this shit here nah..
These motherfuckas don't know I've been
Spittin' this shit since the beginning huh..
I'mma show em how to do it if they wanna
Get into this position yeah

Verse 2:
This is a race. I'm going at a slow muhfuckin' pace
Everyone's ahead the track
I wish I could hack but this ain't no game
I'd sell out for the money and the fame but if I do that, that'd put a bad reputation on my name
I swear to god that this air that I breathe is equivalent to muhfuckin' kerosene
My whole damn life has been a movie scene
Look I'm dying, trying and fighting to rhyme
Look, if I take my time, who knows?
Maybe I'll be in my prime
Tryna be better
Alphabetically murder every letter
Day by day this is dedication, with maybe a little a bit of hesitation
It all starts with confidence and preparation
If I try and not be nervous, I'll have some patience
