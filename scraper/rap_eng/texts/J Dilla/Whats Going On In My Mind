[Intro]
R.I.P Jay Dee
You need that piece of mind?
I give you that Peace of Mind

[Verse 1]
They tryna tell me i'm depressed cas they ain't impressed with
On how my times invested
Objected to follow the accepted
It must have been a misconception that being different meant that you was something special
Tryna teach me lessons and correct my conscious lessened confidence
Had me second guessing almost had me convinced
My brain may be insanely messed
I've had my head on the melt
Just tryna find myself cas they told me (I was someone else)
Some days i feel blessed
Some night I feel possessed by the demons in my chest
Caged feelings collect and effect my sense
It don't make sense that my mind set is positive
But my heart ain't inadequate of negatives
A constant game of tug'o'war between my heart and my head
My art keeps me going and im damn sure of that
Confidence as of late, been damn short of that
Some days i'd rather not wake because I know that
Its gonna be a bad day, some way, some how, something
Will get me down and mess around with my head space
But for now
I remain with this fake misplaced smile
Meanwhile I try figure out whats going on in my mind

Whats going on in my mind x2
(whats going on, wh- whats going on?)
Whats going on in my mind x2
(whats going on, whats going on, wh- whats going on?)
Whats going on in my mind x2
(whats going on, whats going on, wh- whats going on?)
Whats going on in my mind x2
(whats going on, whats going on, whats going on

[Verse 2]
Each day proves more difficult and I don't wana go to school
Adults think its just typical teenage attitude
But I found a different route out
And sitting in a room thought by bafoons is just bad for my health
To obey these rules is optional
I do appreciate the help
But I need some information that'll benefit my intentions
I need to pay attention of my prospective
Not these time wasting lessons or detention for attendance
Whilst I could be making moves man
Losing truth in confusion
Creating clueless students deluded to believing they stupid
Due to illusions of grade conclusions and parents enthusing
Life style they wish not to pursue in
Thrown in to it with no guide, on how to survive
Ay, still defenseless and senseless, quite like a child
Mann.. it my god damn time to shine
But first I gotta figure out whats going on in my mind
