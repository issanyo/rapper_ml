Envision the worst, your nightmares back with a curse
I'm kicking a verse, you wack niggas couldn't rehearse
Emersed in this worth, I been a legacy since the birth
And niggas is thugs, but all I see is pussies in skirts
My mind is instilling a void to insignificant feelings
I thrive for the killings, I'll levitate you right to the ceiling
Immaculate villain, I'm causing cataclysm and grief
I'll clap your clavicle and snap your mandible til it bleeds
I know a lot of ya'll are scared of me apparently the other half laugh when they hear the fable like they was a pharisee
Until I start appearing with torrential rain and lightning spitting flicks of flames that will burst your body like a gamma ray
I'll hit you with a band of blades until you relapse
And crack your fibula until your tibia feels the blast
I mastered the craft of scripting til my writing is daft
Cause when I laughing even paraplegics feeling the wrath
You rapping for cash, so you don't wanna cross on my path
I'll probably noose you while the revolutions cracking your calves
I'll hit you in your abs sharper than a dagger that stabs
I'll batter and blast your vertebrae with rigorous jabs
And I'm the reason for the causalities in honest actuality anybody that battles me is ended with fatalities
I'll split em with machetes and disfigure and limber dismember and denture, send em to place for the sinners
I'll blitz in his center until he starts to bleed from the innards
And piss on his cinders and pray that he is never remembered
Because I bring calamity you couldn't find with a sonar I'm spitefully honored with necrophilia of Jeffrey Dahmer
With the mighty palms I be writing dominant psalms
That shackles and bonds a victim with inimical bombs
Torture your frame, leave you with disastrous plagues
With mortars and flames that liberate formidable pain
I live with insanes and wolves that devour you whole
Entrapping your soul in realms where the desolate roam
Inspecting my dome, where sanity evaded and quit, I'm lonely and pissed, I never had a girlfriend to kiss
I'm empty and scared my pops never loved me or cared
Forget an enemy the worst thing is facing your fears
But I'm savagely unstoppable, logical's phenomenal
The grand imperial and any losing is improbable
Spitting with the renegades
Scripting all the inner rage
Schizophrenic cause the crystalline be running in my veins
Intricate is infinite, blitzing the resistances
Dominance is limitless and you can ask the menaces
I'm a lyrical majesty my intellectuality could actually exceed the levels of the brain capacity
Cause I'm the real deal other niggas is a fallacy I'm the reason that grey even had an anatomy
I'm a walking catastrophe the tragedy possessing avid apathy a savage beast that's roaming on the matted streets WHAT!
