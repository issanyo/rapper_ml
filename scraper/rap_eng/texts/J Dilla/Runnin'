[Verse: Curren$y]
Little nigga but I'm bigger than ya'll
When it comes to the digits I used to roll deep
I had to cut some of them niggas
Was only hanging 'round me to impress them bitches
And get up in them clubs free
But I wasn't with it
Naw homie forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it
You think you really know me
But you might know me
I was born in them 'burbs
Where the 3rd Ward love me, yah
I can't remember running with a brick
Never went
He would go and get a five for twenty off of Willa
Those was humble beginnings
When my niggas used to hustle to pay for their school (?)
And ducking, high when niggas robbing and killing, yah
And I was pushing that Chevy from the East to the Bricks
And then from the Bricks to the East
Cutting class and hanging with (?)
Whipping a quart of water and a bag of Skittles
Hot Spitta  nigga yah
