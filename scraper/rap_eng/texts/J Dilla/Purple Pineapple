You talk heavy as if you could understand the game
French accent, Cuban with the Spanish braids
The thick ass, the thick assets, the thick accent
Man, imma blow up when she pull it, like a hand grenade
Wasted for the past week, so I’m uberin’
Drownin’ in this crown until I’m feeling jubilant
Not a Jewish kid, but I’m tryna make so much mothafuckin’ money…
I won’t know what to do with it
Maybe that’s why rich people are assholes
Offer up their soul for some greed and cash flow
Shit is dense like I’ve been chiefin’ out the hash bowl
Until I’m drinkin’ gin and thinkin’ quick but flowing mad…slow
I never rest, I learn to rap
Heaven sent these verses back, just so I can burn their ass (effortlessly)
I’m scribblin’ hot lead
Pencil on fire it’s all said, and it’s all done
I be looking for the competition and see that they’re all dead
I’m the top chef, with the Top Gun
Pot head with no pot luck, uh
I spit it like surgery hitting it perfectly until your heart jump
And lately it feel like I’m running up against an escalator
Sometimes I let it bring me down
Makin’ people think instead of making paper I just hope they listen when I speak out
And that’s a lot to ask when all these cats are always trapped inside their head
Eyes are red, they try to rest, but Simon said it’s time to text
It’s always sad to see them sign the check, they know that their lives are messed, tryna find the time and time again it’s where their coffin’s at
Only one that’s got my back is my mattress
And after that, I hate to say it, but my casket
I’m titanium, traveling through plastic, and rattlin’
These snakes until I break them I break them into fragments
Disrupt the game like Rosa Parks, cracker finna show his art
Little minnow up against a row of sharks
But bet on me and I’ll make you rich, tread on me I may get pissed
And then release the fucking wrath of Noah’s Ark
I’m runnin up against an escalator
Sometimes I let it bring me down
Makin’ people think instead of making paper
I just hope they listen when I speak out
(Bring me down)
