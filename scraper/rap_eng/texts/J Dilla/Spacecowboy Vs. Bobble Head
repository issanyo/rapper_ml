[Mikey Dread sample, famous from "Paid In Full"]
Oh my gosh!
The music, just turns me on!

{One two...}

[sample comes back 1:05 into the song]
The music, just turns me on!

{One, one, one...}
{One two...}

"Join us every third Tuesday of the month
At two AM for the token jazz hour!"

[sung 9X to end]
Bah-bum-bum, bo-bum, bo-bum
