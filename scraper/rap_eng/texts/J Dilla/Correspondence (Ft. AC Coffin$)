[Son Anthony]
Kore wa the axiom that hate throughout life continues flowing at the maximum rate
It doesn't stop, and if it did, shit, split with me the difference
I'm tired of animosity subconsciously give inference
Now into this with lyrics seeping out of every pore
Get the style wild. While in every isle at the store
I'm indecisive with these choices so I'll buy the whole lot
Of just fruit, salt crackers, baby carrots and cold pop
Now don't stop, keep it lit
Never felt the need to quit
Hopping in a car that isn't mine but have the keys to it
Speeding out the scene before a trace is left that leads to us
Needless to say, Coffins$ go your up to tear your beat to bits

[AC Coffin$]

[Hook]
Treat em like dice, shake em up shake em
Son Coffin$ is history in the making
Long awaited, we're checking to see if you're conscious
Our correspondence leaves your head peace nodding
We defy science
And go against the grain
The two of us be that brand new thing
We're illogical, plus when we rhyme It's straight nonsense
Our correspondence leaves your head peace nodding x3

[Son Anthony]
Who else can rhyme a verse and make it animated?
Or cut off his own head and bleed gamma radiation
Then rejuvenate the cranium, same brain and all
And have it end up with a face only a mother could love?
Only I, S-O-N, was designated ace
And in case you didn't know I resonate throughout space
Case and point. Heavyweighters, not some regular boys
Now make noise. We're out late fucking casing the joint
Destroyed

[Hook]
Treat em like dice, shake em up shake em
Son Coffin$ is history in the making
Long awaited, we're checking to see if you're conscious
Our correspondence leaves your head peace nodding
We defy science
And go against the grain
The two of us be that brand new thing
We're illogical, plus when we rhyme It's straight nonsense
Our correspondence leaves your head peace nodding
