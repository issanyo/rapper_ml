[Intro]
Blue eyes
My blue eyes are so beautiful
Mixtape, Based God
Ya'll niggas are gonna miss me when I'm gone, so respect Lil B for while he's here on Earth
A real legend
Changed music

[Verse 1]
How could you forget about your younger nigga? I was thugging nigga
Only brother from the gutter that was fucking with ya
Stole rides, smoked blunts, we high
Now you saying that I snitched, how I switched
I'm the same young nigga that was on that shift
Niggas rocking all night, don't stop, that's life
Hitting every lick, I rode the bus that night
But shit, don't try, I might bust that twice
And your daddy is a lion, just remember this jungle
It's nothing to a tiger, that's word to my mother
Keep the heat hugged when I'm on that level
Niggas...fuck niggas, fuck bitches, hating together
And really never, my blood is so ghetta (?)
Do bars respect the gun, bitch
Fifty grand in my bag, how I carry this?
And I'm the best man, shit, I'm have to marry me

[Hook]
Niggas asked if I'm right or wrong
I don't know, but I'm God when I write these songs

[Verse 2]
Need for the (?), need me for the pain
Lost nights out the life, playing the game
Got locked up, damn near lost it all
If you're charged with what I'm charged with you fall
Ten to twenty, that's the minimum
Saving my referrals, suspended by the principal
They ain't know I was a legend, putting licks in the day
I be gone in sixty seconds, I'm a sick raccoon
I'm out in the day, do bad then be back at noon
Remember every single time I was in my room
Damn near got saved when the police raided
And I ain't even mad; I was doing the crime, and I'm damn sure doing the time
You niggas is lying, damn nearâ€¦
The judge think you a (?) to a state
Looking at your case and he looking at your face
Better keep it straight, or you going up state

[Hook]
I'm God when I write these songs
I don't know if I'm the best, but I'm God when I write these songs

[Verse 3]
My gangsta's a gangsta's gangsta
Top hat off top, I tilt my *pause* to thank ya
You always think crazy high niggas robbing
He ain't gotta be a Blood but he ready to die
For BasedWorld, cause he know that we keep it real
Like a married man, it's all love
Like a TV show, watch them Scrubs
Two (?) stoned thugs
Be driving by the blood, money and girls and drugs
Niggas be buzzed way before they get in the club
Nigga we letting loose, but we richer than *pause*
But I swear we going broke together, you feel me?
Blue Eyes forever
And I'm rich, we going broke together
It's Blue Eyes forever
Lil Boss

[Hook]
I don't know if I'm for real, but I'm God when I write these songs
But I'm *pause* when I write these songs
I don't know if I'm right or wrong, but I think I'm God when I write these songs
Don't know if I'm right or wrong, I think I'm God when I write these songs
Don't know if I'm right or wrong, I think I'm God when I write these songs
Don't know if I'm right or wrong, I think I'm *pause* when I write these songs
