I like that shit right there
Rhythm, dope
Tone, check
Range, check
Key, low
Voice, check
Melody? (Yeah)
Melody? (Yeah)
Melody? (Oh)

I’ve always had it in me but I’ve just now found my voice
(Oouuu yeah yeah that's my voice, that's my voice)

Okay momma was a singer so angelic
Poppa was a writer, so prolific
X plus Y make a man with no limits
Re-living lost dreams, re-polishing talent
With knowledge from a 3rd world steady expanding
Easy does it, groovy, relaxing
Songs that’ll get you home lil night bandit
Outlandish tunes getting handed
I'm tryna make the kind to surpass everlasting
Screw what they want, here’s a dose of what you need
A, B
Great lyrics
Umph in it
Melody
A, B
Great lyrics
Umph in it
Melody
