[Hook]
She say she wanna hear me on some Dilla shit
She say she wanna hear me on some Dilla shit

[Verse 1]
I wonder if we'll ever get freedom
For those who really think that niggas free, dumb
Not to discredit our efforts and how far we've come
But fuck the truth I need proof, can I see some?
It's like the same ones preaching  be involved in scandals
I rarely ever watch the tube and I got all the channels
Lord knows it's two sides to every story
The raw truth and the side they call the handle
I'm not a star but I just hope that they align
I heard the shit they said was true and I just hope that they was lyin'
On tour with Dizzy, convos that alter my state of mind
I know they killed our leaders and those that can sway the minds
Askin' the Lord for forgiveness, down on both knees
In these streets I catch still like I was told freeze
You not official, that's easy to call like it was toll free
Feelin' like a prisoner in the land when we was told free
I could hit the club and be surrounded thots
But the blunt got me thinkin' I'm surrounded by darts
Like when,  where, and how do I start
And niggas swear that I'm the truth cause that's what pound in my heart
There's only so much that the mind can take
Goin hard until the rims inside the tires scrape
A silhouette now, I'm in solid shape
Not a skeleton in sight, with plenty closet space
And don't extend ya hand if you a hater, I ain't tryna shake
If I don't feel the vibe in this bitch then I'm tryna shake
A thin line between love and hate and that's not a hyphen
Today's music, love and hate just a lot of hypin'
How you plan to clash with a nigga when you not a titan
Instagram, you see what I'm on but you ain't gotta like it
I can predict you cats careers, and I'm not a psychic
Just that diamond in the rough, on some hard to find shit
When you a three time felon you got less options
Blogs fuckin' with a sure shot will get the lead poppin'
A day one where I'm from, not wit the set hoppin'
And yea we stood on our dollars, just not with [?]
And if we don't fit the picture I'm like let's crop it

[Hook]
She say she wanna hear me on some Dilla shit
She say she wanna hear me on some Dilla shit
She say she wanna hear me on some Dilla shit

[Outro]
Know she gonna feel this shit
Don't forget the Z
Long live Dilla
