[Chorus:The parlotones]
Yesterday (twice)
All my troubles seem so far away (yea)
Now looks as thou they here to stay
Oh I Believe In Yesterday x3


[Verse:Npk Twice]
This ain't no place to leave
Wanna leave call me na√Øve
But I wanna be a somebody
Don't mean famous but a family
With a better life with a lot of stuff...
A house,a home a family
A wife,a kid maybe 2 or 3
A job,respect, even power be
I'm tired being that kid from the rural area...
Wanna move to jhb an start a new career
Work my way to the top working non-stop...
Donald triumph dreams
Suicidal schemes
All this dog eat dog days
Brother,take care of mother
Ill be back sooner then later
Till then take care of her an lil sister
Till then Your the man of the house ntwana...
Wish me well I'm leaving kusasa...

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
Bag in hand,I'm grabin the sand
Ancestors wish me well I'm leaving this land...
Dad left but he never came back...
But I will as soon as I find proper work...
Abakithi mabangkhusele
Ninginikeze na mandla ngizimele...
Mother haven't been the best of sons
Crime always one of my plans...
Never paid back like scam life plans...
Then again I'm tryna correct that
Wish I graduated an thrown the hat...
But that ain't for me,oh not yet...
Promised ill find success
I'm on ma way to jozi,city of gold...
