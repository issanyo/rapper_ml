[Chorus]
Look at these niggas, they taking off
This evening
Some of you niggas gonna take a loss
This evening
You can go figure that I'm a hella of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss

[Verse 1]
Yo, I gotta be the realest and illest nigga to spit
How I balance the challenge is as rigorous as it gets
I don't battle these rappers I ' how I feel
Off with the kill, I'm a professional, I'm skilled
Ill for real, I got the record for the deal
When it's time to chill I'm killing it in Montreal
In the club on silk where we popped a couple of pills
While I grab the tits of my girl '

[Chorus]
Look at these niggas, they taking off
This evening
Some of you niggas gonna take a loss
This evening
You can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening
Which one of these girls gonna take it off
This evening
Ain't gotta spend money for me to ball
This evening
And you can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening

[Verse 2]
Friday night, lights with the 'rooftop view
You thought you was coming but my crew stopped you
Cause all of my peeps is honor and you not true
Prepared to watch you splitting your rhymes and it's not true
Chew on these candy wrappers two by two
Bout to start the new with my crew
While I'm counting all this mula chilling with a honey
Dip that, sink that, she strip at the Moulin Rouge
Like I slap the whole crew when I do what I do
Staying true to me is what I do, what?


Look at these niggas, they taking off
This evening
Some of you niggas gonna take a loss
This evening
You can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening
Which one of these girls gonna take it off
This evening
Ain't gotta spend money for me to ball
This evening
And you can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening

[Verse 3]
I don't know what I'm hitting, all I know is that it's physical
I don't know what I'm killing, all I know is I'm feeling you
So drop off your conscience while I proceed to finish you
I made up a better day and then play with you, diminish you
Don't start fiendng when you see my alien tentacles
No, it's not a friend of you, I'm a serious individual
Backing this money to get the crib with the swimming pool
Backing these honeys cause I'm a smooth ass criminal
Hey girl, it's me and you, let's interview each other in my room, in the nude, in the view

[Chorus]
Look at these niggas, they taking off
This evening
Some of you niggas gonna take a loss
This evening
You can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening
Which one of these girls gonna take it off
This evening
Ain't gotta spend money for me to ball
This evening
And you can go figure that I'm a hell of a nigga
And I'mma stay in position cause I'm a boss
This evening
