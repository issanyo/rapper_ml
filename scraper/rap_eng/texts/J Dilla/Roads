Let's lay the bricks down to take us to the end game
It may not be the most ideal but just like from where I whence came
Common seems aims to knock us down while I am floating with my head so in the clouds you would have thought that I had grown wings
Often times zoning when I'm up late like Conan pondering if we're alone one in the universe at the moment
And hitherto our sphere if there were species just like the ones our home calls human beings and did they blow themselves to pieces?
While I was privileged, goods were never in abundance
I had worked for what I wanted and never underwent hunger
As I age I feel the pages grow in number while I'm trying to recover the wonderment like when I was younger
Shit gets real when you subscribe to evolution and you sympathize with students and admire revolution
I've cried the Nile but it's dried up sine the moon left
Now I'm moving to a new land to finally tie up loose ends
I bent spoons once with my mind but can't prove it
You just have to take my word based on my prudence I can do it
Constantly questioned but running our of excuses as to why I spit cerebral though I'm so damn stupid?
Well if the shoe fits, use them to run a mile in. They're comfortable and stylish when you learn to deal with Nihilism
Hard to comply when citizens turn victims over differences of skin tones, class, age, or religions
Sorry if you think I'm here to thwart your vision
But I won't be the one to end up with my eyeball missing
