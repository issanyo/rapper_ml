[Verse 1]
Battling my thoughts
Watch the cattle when they walk
I’m on Saturn on a Saturday
Paint splatter matter gray
Doesn’t matter but I had to say
What I had to say proof is the Alizé
When one gets loose then the truth spills
So I’m tighter than a noose feel
Round your neck a pound of ses
Fucking up every noun against
Does that make sense when I blaze a dime
Just to keep my state of mind
Higher than the rate of crime
Flyer with amazing rhymes
But I’m trapped in a maze
Rapping for days
Brain scattered I’m phased
Pave ways with suedes laced
My name great you lames hate
My flame faint but its still living on
And ain’t no limit dog
Fuck gimmick skimming mothafucka
I will kill em’ all
And that’s a different flow
So if you didn’t know
I been a dope mothafucka
Spitting rhythms gold stunta
Cause in this world of squares
I choose to be a cube
Be acute angel in the winter air
I been a flair I been a hope
You sitting there you been a joke
No fucking way I’m quitting nope
So shut the fuck up muster up
Energy I bust a nut in enemies
That’s fussing what?
Could you ever say to phase me
Never prayed to hades
Well you should now
Ruler of the underground
And thats what’s good now
