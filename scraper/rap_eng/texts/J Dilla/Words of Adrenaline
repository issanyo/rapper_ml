[Verse 1: RKZ]

I'm on the road again
Nice guy but I roll up in my hoodie and
Screw face passers by, so they're afraid of me
Cross the road, they don't see who I really am
Just who I'm trying to be
I'm really not me
A nice guy, nice friends, with a bad streak
Silly men act tough, but they ain't me
I guess that's why they run up to my face
And when I look into their mind, it's always empty

I try to, push education to the young ones
Graduated now, look at all I've done, son
22 going on like I'm 35, tryna survive
With, minds of the elders, so many sceptics
So many envious, so many helped me
See all their bad traits, everything I'd never be
Everything I've seen and everything I would never need
I'll shake your hand but, that's cause I'm polite
Don't think I'm part of this stereotype
So many bitch about so many men
Then they see them and it's like they're best friends
I, won't react to people being bitches
I just won't acknowledge you, mind how you switching
I'm never changing my attitude for you
If you're famous, okay, but that is nothing cool

I respect talent, real recognise real
That's why they recognise me, they recognise will
They realise I'm realer than most of these big ballers
With really big money rolling with millis and vocoders
That ain't me though, wondering why I'm not signed?
Don't know the answer, maybe it's not my time...yet
Focus myself, I'll stay patient
Walk up and down the ends. Word to Statemeant

[Verse 2: RKZ]

I'm that kid with an attitude, my flow's so coherent
Hear my voice in prominence, my words clearer
Master of the mic, cause I've studied this for years
Degree in music, I'm a music man to peers
Ask anyone that knows me, my work rate is alarming
People try to parallel and I keep disregarding
Cause honestly I'm tired of proving everything through words so
Let me break it down a little better in verses, cursive
It hurts when you're heard but ain't worth it
So they will write you off
Cause they don't see what your word is
Yes, I am a wordsmith, though I'm still developing
Call me ever rising like I'm living off adrenaline
They high from toking everything
High from highest highs, flying by, like they're balling
Flying high on the Emirates

I've given you the world, given you the best of me
Though it's not apparent cause there's too much going on
I feel like we're teenagers in need of some attention
Every time I sing, I want you to hear my song
I want you to sing along, is that much to ask for?
I don't wanna be rich, I just wanna last more
So when I'm long gone
You can hear my voice
I could carry on. I could fill the past void
Of never having hope, having dreams, having goals
Give you Power Trippin so that you can reach the world
Everyone's a hero in this life full of hopefuls
So I am nothing more than anyone you'd ever hope for
