[Verse 1]
Sounds like my right tone, a pyrite stone
I guess you caught me digging fools’ gold
The very reason why I write poems
To right my wrongs, if you knew better you would do so
I was wrong, now you gotta kiss me through the phone, now I’m gone
Your day’s blue and your mood’s blown
It’s too soon before it seem like time took too long
The table’s turned, we gotta move on

[Hook]
I know that I can’t be what you want me to be
But I know you know that we gon' come to times like this
But truth is, sometimes it don’t rain on two lips
That sunshine don’t mean a thing where you live
Colors in my wallet lookin' gray and gloomy
Give it up one time for the pain in this music
Oh oh yea yea
Oh oh yea yea
It’s a brighter day
Open your eyes up and pray
Oh oh yea yea
Oh oh yea yea
It’s a brighter day
Open your eyes up and pray

[Verse 2]
A concrete rose from the land of the hazardous
I only ground down like it’s Nazareth
Catch me in the Crooklyn palaces, up in genesis
With my fabulous queen, I woke up from my miraculous dream
Uhm, they say life ain’t what it seems
It’s what you make it, so I tailored the inseams
And now I’m comfortable in my genes
I wrote one leg up & extended my lean
Tell me I'm definitely look clean
First I catch your fresh, then I cash this check
Isn’t it?
Now I’m lookin' fresh, my pockets back in effect
So what's the cause for the sneakers with the check?
I feel like a fresh air force's first step
Like some fresh flesh, first pack, first sex
And then I doze off for a sec
And see the hand of god pick me up like forceps
You told me never to forget and never to force it
To embrace the time and glorious moments
Cus you could die in a second
So open up within, fore I get to dissecting
I woke up again but this time forgettin'
Scratching my chin like that was rather interesting
I turn to the small coffee table on the right
Pick up my pen and turn on my thinking light

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live(X4)
