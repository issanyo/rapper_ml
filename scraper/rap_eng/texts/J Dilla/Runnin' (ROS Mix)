Intro:
Anxious, paranoid
Factors I can avoid
Happen to crack a void
I'm running from my issues

Hook:
Can't keep running away  x4

Verse 1:
Guess this is my life
Filled with pride, ill advise, tilting sides, killing ties
Spilling lies, feeling life’s shit and I’d rather die than sit and cry
Wish that I
Had a genie that could see me, and grant me three miracles
Always seek easy relief rather than facing the beast, typical
These streets are lonely, speak and only the breeze is hearing you
I lay and bleed, rolling and see my homie freeze and ridicule
See he just stabbed me right in the back with the horn of a mammoth, that glory filled bastard
Only mastered the art of wrapping the woolly fabrics of all his captives and wear it like fashion
Now I’m fucking blasting, now I’m the one casting you out like a demon, see man, you got me fucked up
Say I got to suck it up, but I’m done accepting, resenting, now I trust none
No regretting, only lessons and a couple rough ones
But I gotta grow up

Verse 2:
Guess this is my life
Filled with pride, ill advise, tilting sides, killing ties
Spilling lies, feeling life’s shit and I’d rather die than sit and cry
Wish that I
Had the courage to handle the antagonists, ravaging my sanity
Hampering happiness, heart’s another casualty
I’m casually allowing them to devour my power, as I cower and wonder
What happened to me
Pressure, feel like I’m drowning
Questions, they start mounting
Guess there’s no way out it
My chest is feeling rowdy
I need to, breathe
I need to, breathe
Alright back, just another attack, it seems
I’ve been struggle to sleep
They say something’s bothering me
And I need to relax, or I could crack
Or choke on coke and whole lotta dope and float in the after life
With Marilyn, Kurt and Mac
But I don’t want my heart to go cold before I reach gold
I gotta grow, damn
