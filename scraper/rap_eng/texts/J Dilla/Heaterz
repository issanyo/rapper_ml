[VERSE 1]

We spit and spray like a bulletproof, nine milimeter shoot
Niggas got the heaters, woop, we about to beat em, tell 'em tie a tighter noose around they neck
Yank em round the block, in distress, these rap bitches on dog collars
Muzzle their bark, holla
Bitch I am the Ayatollah
Actually, all of you niggas harder, forward slash sarcasm
Feelin' apocalypto 'cuz the flow is cataclysmic
And your swagger got jacked
You niggas amazed with genuine talent but I'm amazed that you haven't
Managed to make your points valid
Fuck snappin' and fuck the snaps movement
Yeah I rock snaps but you niggas just tools
And I'm the fuckin' leader, go ahead impeach 'em
Stank is how I treat 'em, Dilla let the beat run
Now its time to eat hunger, heat it up, heat it up
MP to the third letter
Beat it up

[HOOK]

A nigga runnin' round with the heater
Def Ninja runnin' for Prez, you better impeach him
Caused 9/11 with the sound from the speakers
Poison pen, throwin' stars, 'imma Zyclone B them

[VERSE 2]

Woah
I'm relaxin' on 'em
Said the first verse ain' impactin' all em
Sometimes I think I'm goin' over heads
Or maybe they're all just dead;
Brains splattered to the floor, mind blown out of their headphones, dreading
A sequel to the masterpiece that eats through the mental like a sheet of LSD does
I'll sell you sips of my beautiful lemonade, intoxicate, emulate a nigga
Then celebrate a triple pressing of the deluxe, new Def Ninja redux about to hit your seafront
Wash up on seashores, too small to be a whale but the style is Gigantor, re-up on the Oz
Promethazine and codeine
The mescaline is flowing
Ecstasy to dome piece
My form is just now morphing
So now I need the morphine
Numb to you critics, slow fiend for the fans but I'm not slowing down
I'm finna be the greatest nigga around

[HOOK]

A nigga runnin' round with the heater
Def Ninja runnin' for Prez, you better impeach him
Caused 9/11 with the sound from the speakers
Poison pen, throwin' stars, 'imma Zyclone B them
