[Chorus] x4
I've got to be the only one
To go and get it done
Chasing a dream that's just begun
Stay up til the morning sun

[Verse: Pat G]
God Moves
I've got this poem, and, would like to call it, Blank Check
In the QC there's something going on
People living by the paycheck, too close to look beyond
Lacking savings doesn't define you, man
Open your mind to really understand
These people are just like you
Trying their best to get through
Challenges life presents
I've been there too, and represent
My family and friends
Some things change, but can open
Up on how you feel at the time
Right now I show you, in a rhyme
Every beat allows me to vent
And speak for the people tryna pay rent
Saving up each and every cent
This letter is sent to those that spend
All they've got on the newest trend
Think about those whose lives depend
On anything they can fit and mend
Try again and again to improve their situation
Nothing seems to work, turn to drugs for a sensation
Soon after end up on probation
You and I have all got some relation
These people are all across the nation
When they're charged think of this occasion
The way to help is through education
Broadcast this message like a station
You should know I've been chasing my dream
That shouldn't be such an extreme
But we all struggle with self esteem
Let me use this time to come clean
Used to feel like my life wasn't mine
All I could do was pray to God for a sign
That's when I finally realized the design
Was for us all to be universally aligned
Now there's no way we all fit in the frame
Know deep in your soul that we're all the same
I speak of peace in His name
And rid myself of shame
Some may think I'm insane
But hey, that's just a piece of my brain
