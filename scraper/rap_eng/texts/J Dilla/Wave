Niccas Trapn' and Rapping

These cops ain't paying booking fees

And niccas with degrees

Taking pleas on they second degree

Niccas out robin got student loans

To payback for college niccas in the hood

Got more degrees than diplomas

And the crooked government in debt

With more money to loan ya

And we just trying to get paid

Fuck what you think

My life like having a black belt with out a sensei

Misguided youth

Taught misslead truth

T.v. and a couch

Call it the electric chair

Niccas trying imitate

Entertainment

And a nicca a join a gang

Cause he come from a broken home

And his best friend got

Shot the dome by the enemy

Raise by the same corrupted

System that shot kennedy

Niccas in the hood sick

Overdosing trying to find the remedy


Chours x4
Don't Know Why We Living Like This


Sometimes you win sometime you loose

In this game of life you got to pay your dues

No matter what direction you take its

Going to be a struggle and if success mets ya path

You go to stay humble

Got to prioritize your priority

Weigh out ya options

A couple obstacle a keep you aloof balk

But you said every thing come easy

With a challange

Ghetto grave yards

Filled with wasted talent

Niccas feel like lebron

Got carry the heat

Ain't no championships

Off in these streets

And niccas skipping school

Got mo js in line

Then the jordan brand

Trying to be the man

In the dope game

Caught they first

Drug felony  so they can't get no sally mae

Destined for a minimum wage salary

But thats how it is when you trying

To get it how you live nigga

Chorus x4
Don't Know Why We Living Like This
