It's a new day.. time to get up, and wake up
Lady lifes hoping we don't break up, to make up
The stakes up, getting high, dawg we need the great stuff
Amaze us, tryna get lifted when I blaze up
..And my girl be running though my mind
So it defines how her assets so fine
On the line, I be blind, cuz I see clear reality
Sike I'm in the psych ward, my mind like hospitality
Expanding your mentality, to every nationality
Cuz spirituality ain't all about the salaries
Its that funky fuck Jaz, in the drunken truck blastin
The function up, here to fuck shit up, Mad
Man, I'm just tryna jam to this
Why you gotta act a bitch, I'll find you like catfish
Pass this, to the homies and puff it
Fill your mind with substance, U rappers too redundant
Reluctant, and something's missing in your production
It's nothing.. assuming its me
I blew out the weed, and lies left beneath
Will the skies let me breathe, I'm high off my feet
Hardly, I stopped drinking Bacardi
And going to parties since I met my girl Darby
