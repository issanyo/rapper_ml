[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm never involved in them brawls
My Beretta returns your phone calls
I'd rather chrome you all, you know
Gotta invoke like it's data and blow your soul
To Saturn, it doesn't matter how you roll, I'd rather you go
To the cemetery or morgue with 10 or 12 of your boys over hoes, money, or irrelevant wars
Whoever ain't nice to the gun or the knife that'll number your nights
It's once in his life then he's done it before
Now he's a glitch in history so we would mention the mystery
A leader or henchmen we done heard it before
He never spoils like he's suppose to feel the 'dro and kill you before he feels you close
Now that's the price you pay when the fightin' is done
You hesitated on life and died with a gun
Millions of suckahs a freeze when the real approach, if you bluffing then you go
The steel is cold
Thought you was good in the hood if you pull and he pull, he'll run from you, nope
That thing you got in your pants can stop any man but it's not in your hand, so...
And let us pray that the nigga you face's steel is as cold as yours, I hope

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Go downs..
Stumbled off grounds
Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time
Your dogs was wives, actin like girls, get feminine when handlin guns
You could run or take the window, son
Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun
Without a fight son, we keep the house dope like Pavenni's
We twist and pop Henny, gettin wet on the daily, and
Peers get chilly, turnin macks fully
Now they bandin', caught red handed and got remanded, for it
A one to three degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V
And send me up a hub tours of state facilities
What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf
Or wait until my time served and get released
Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama
I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma
These kids started to drilling like they ready and willing
I gave em exactly no time to switch feelings
Pulled out, to my man, look out
Commence the warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here
Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top
Hours of thinkin about how I'mma tip they ass up out the basket
Beligerant glass heads, I'm bashing
No knowledge of the man or his action
Class now is session, soldier boys, today's aim is
Never show your heat And don't flame it
You playin life, wit a man who lives by the sword
And dies naturally against all common laws
What, speed on and Peed on
