[Verse 1: Que D]
It’s the grand imperial
Scooping sucker MCs like cereal
The last time I wrote a rhyme you didn’t hear me though
So I’mma drop this nigga so you can feel me though
I’m dropping flows that’s just so ridiculous
I got a *** she’s addicted to licorice
She can suck a (uh what, uh) good ___
She did (what?) me and my whole click
F-C, Funky Cowboy that’s how we do it
Rodeo every time that we do a show
Yes yes funky fresh in the flesh
It’s me, who me?
This nigga that they call Q-U U-E
To the period, D
Yes yes baby
Errol Flynn at disco, Bustin the gibb
Yeah that’s how these niggas do from the mount called 6
Better known as Macknikulous, no you can’t get with this
Here I go again just dropping that Supa Shit
Yeah I’m living drama free
So if u got drama baby no you can’t get with me
I said u better take it easy cause I got ya gettin freaky on the dancefloor
Throw ya hands in the air if ya just want more
I’m dropping sucker MCs right at the door
If you can’t pass the MC test
Now you know who’s the best
Que D and that’s me, yeah that’s my life
If ya ain’t got the rhyme then don’t touch the mic
Yes y’all to the beat and keep on keep on keep on
