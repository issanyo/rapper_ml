I'm sorry

My time is on the low side
Chalk it up to low tide
Donuts of the hearts that toasted hosters of art
Poster boys that've held von doom back
While a durag blew that gas station apart
We're wearing beanies in this miami heat
So whats that mean?
Perhaps we're attacking,with vitriol
Masking our own senses of pride

WWhile somehow managing to chalk it up to low tide
TTime spent on the low side
NNow does it seem like a low side?

Why do we have to pick between teams?
Are you a lord of the royal persuasion
Harmonizing and raising yourselves
About all of these white teeth teens
While the plaque ridden kids
Look at their teeth to know what color gold is
Never been anything to put on all these deli displays
No pink frosting with sprinkles to make you yellow in fact
Maybe its because we boil ramen down to personal attacks
Because these wheat products don't help my hunger
I hate the fact I never get my bread and my wine

[Hook]But maybe in my due time

I'll manage to chalk it up to low tide
Time spent on the low side
Now does it seem like a low side?

IIts like I need to eat more,to rise
TTeeth still yellow,but its a start
TThe best thing about time
IIs that its like the donut of the heart
