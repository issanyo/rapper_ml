[Intro:]
J Dilla
Stay trill-a, never contain filla
Sanfizzy, number one pain killa
New age crate digga

[Biggie:] (x2)
(Now they heard you blowin' up like Nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through ya windpipe slow)

[Verse 1:]
Ever since I was embryonic, life's been nothing but hell
Imprinted on a empty comic, in a nutshell
I've been and will be simply honest, Danville's best sending homage
To every MC that makes no empty promise
Best friends become strangers, blessings become strainers
Livin' shows the difference 'tween a lesson and a prayer
Hip hop's new gainsayer, bookies never on the same page
Into my main lair, look he's fuckin' with ya brain waves
Now Imma start to tell you all about me
I always let my heart spill and leave the crowd pleased
My bars spit hard shells like in the Southeast
Let these leaves bark still, smokin' loud trees
Yeah I got the white lines, don't sniff 'em
If joints got spiked pine, I don't lift 'em
Ya boy's got to fight crime, bring back rhythm
Straight activism, leave a great cataclysm
Never keep the Busch Light, no Anheuser
Girl I'll hold ya tush tight, but still be the man wiser
My homies always push right, but kush is like the grand meister
Hold down Riverside, but stay on the swisher side

[Hook:]
You wanna drop dimes and think you got the right flow
But never drop rhymes anytime I let the mic go

[Biggie:]
(Now they heard you blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through ya windpipe slow)

[Verse 2:]
Got the grams, when I hear a siren sound, it's the narcs
"PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR!"
The jig is up, officer says to all of us, oh well
But never figured he was opposite of a novice at rollin' L's
Another day in the life and times
And fuckers say I have no right to rhyme
Sorry mister for not bein' up to par witcha
I grew up far quicker than a boy at his bar mitzvah
Need a girl sweet like a nice cigar swisher
If we got the chemistry, then maybe I can harness ya
Have ya in my arms quicker than light speed
Never rest for a hip hop S.O.S., let's light seeds

[Hook] (x2)
