Tomorrow never knows
The sorrow never shows
A star that never glows
In borrowed leather clothes
I'm tarred and weather blown
It's hard to sever bone
Apart from letters home
It's dark, ever alone
My start is set in Rome
I park the better stone
And hark a deader moan
Than part of lead in dome
No hearth, it's bread on stone
Sparring, heart departing
Glory shown a part of story known
I'm a fucking walking larynx
Embarrassed to parent seraphim
Karats of Ferris merits and
Perish in Harrison's garrison
Cherish being the chairman for the perishing. Like where he sing?
(Yeah). (Yeah)
Last I saw him he was driving with a spare
Arriving with a pair of writhing boas in his hair
Goad him if you dare
Below him? No one's there
I wrote and rode roads
To tote the bold load
I vote the goats sold
I broke in both molds
Hold coats and note rolled
And potent mojos
A note from most olds
Can't tote like opals
That bloat the shows told
Today, olé
Matador, what you laughing for?
Captured satin drawers
Latin for the captain gourd as if he rapping poor
Sat in four four beats
The poor door creaks
As warlord speaks
At Mordor's peaks
I was that token stoner kid ‘for I ever smoked
On that broken loner shit, I was quite the clever bloke
Forgive me if I’m wrong, so forever hold a grudge against me
Life it seems is meaningless, give me a nudge and then see
Good lord Joseph
I know Pinocchio is a no
But so goeth my nose in low doses
Oh shit, I go lowest when blows of low poets they flow to my spirit
I hear it, cheer it
My mojo meridian
Flow so obsidian
I know no oblivion
So cold the city wind
Is throwing my pity in
And no bold can pretty sin
Snowballs to shit again
Opals in gritty grins
I'm a mind corrupt
The line to define blew up
Yeah my time is up
Sign the winding vines
Vices, whether dices or gin, ‘Till I cannot afford where the prices begin
My mind gone, like a Saigon, war veteran
Ever since a kid with eyes as wide as Letterman
Ivories, back on this cycle of slacking
Stone cold…
Stone cold…
