Verse one:

The name is Dilla Dawg
And i can only rep the real and the raw
And i been in this game something like a vet
I already flipped the range and whipped the Lex
And y'all seen the beam of the minx
The whole team is creamed up
Pimpin to the pinky ring cuz
Its how we do in the dirty district
Cans of whoop ass, murders and pistol whips
Ain't nothing we immune to it
Used to the bluckas and bangs
Its not the game and i rock them chains
That making em envy beef
We got things that make them mans sleepy

Bridge
DIlla Dawg in this, yeah yeah Do ya thang
Do ya thang, woop woop do ya thang kate wiggins up in this
And Dwele up in this do ya thang

Verse two:
Yeah ya got ya clones and then me
Going out to the doofus
Claiming they own them deuce deuces
And don't even own a ten speed
Stop cos yall dont wanna go against we
The district dangerous from flows to mp's
Let me show yall how to do this biatch
Go ahead with yall lil gas station  jacobs
Yall just clowns without the makeup wake up
Let me show yall how to do this biatch
Plus its time time for time for action
You won't catch me in them cyphers cypher rappin
I'm in the Dub wednesday nights with dykes and asses poppin
Bitches see us pop bottles and they ask for glasses
They lucky to get a glass a pop
It's the cake boys with the massive knots
We the truth like like the Glock is plastic
Hands up lets flash the rocks
