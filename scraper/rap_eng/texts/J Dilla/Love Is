[Refrain 1]
Ayo, It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic

[Verse 1: T3]
Yeah, she showed me the way, Carlito
Her cerebral, I put a player back on the fetal, position
Tap out, need an intermission
Wish she blow my referee whistle back in detention
Yeah, I'm going in with my pen and I draw image
We tear to bear, to yours off the hinges
Time don't exist with dismissin' we bout our bidness
Relationship is  a trip and i'm Captain Phillips
See all I wanna do is put my zoom zoom and a poom poom
In a bedroom with her hair loose with tattoos
Stand on two's in rare shoes, getting seduced
Off of that goose and my face up in her caboose, go

[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, show me that you care
Girl, show me that you're there
Show me how your loneliness has flown
Yeah, you're giving me the light

[Refrain 1]
Ayo, It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic, come on
It's fantastic

[Verse 2: Illa J]
Sex is unbelievable
How we ended up in this position, i don't even know (oh)
Sex is so cold, if I had to give it a temperature 40 below (oh)
Damn you're so regal, to be able to give head like that is illegal (oh)
Oh mami, yo finito. Te ame ver tus tetas so I can reload
Never too much, never too much
Sex is always incompleto
No clock in the bedroom like a casino
We keep putting in work without calling the T
Yo fantastic

[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, show me that you care
Girl, show me that you're there
Show me how your loneliness has flown
Yeah, you're giving me the light

[Refrain 2]
We say fan-ta-serro
You say, huh, what, you know
She that shit, aiyyo
She that shit, aiyyo
Fantastic

[Verse 3: Young RJ]
She on top of the list, delete her
Ass she got, put pressure on Serena
She backed it up, hit apples like them arena
She speaking in tongues, and wrapping old cohiba's
No inhale longues and never catched a breather
We never quit, the ghetto ballerina
We get involved, I turn her on like a sprinkler
Live like a speaker, never mind it's the diva
Half Latina, her flow is aquafina
Such a thrill seeker when she rubbing on her seeder
Would, she give it to you good, she a pleaser
I'mma repeat her, I need her, I guess that that's the [?]
Fantastic

[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, show me that you care
Girl, show me that you're there
Show me how your loneliness has flown
Yeah, you're giving me the light
