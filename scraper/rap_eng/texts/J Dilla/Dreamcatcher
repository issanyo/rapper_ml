It's so simple
I'm very Detrimental
When the pad meets the pencil
I'm bodying instrumentals
Listen This true potential
When I'm flowing off the mental
Hope these rhymes from my temple
A put me up in a temple
Flow is popping it's hot
Man Somebody open a window
Cause when I'm spitting missiles
I'm feeling apocolyptal
Yo these rappers divas
They be actin like barbies
But Understand if we ain't no kin
Then I go akimbo
Look
Man I'm ruthless
I be spitting till I'm toothless
And I'm spitting flames
Like I'm Toothless
So now I'm training dragons
Lyrical assassin
A savage
I'm too dope
Puff puff pass it

YO

At night I just be over thinking
But I spit this food
That make You can sink ya teeth in
I flow enough to fill the sink up
And have you Thinking 'bout
Diving in the deep in
But Man I should be sleeping
But Just keep doing what you do
Kill the game on my to-do
Pulling strings like it's voodoo
Writing rhymes they like who knew
Adolescence I was working all winter
We bouta blow up
So What kinda party you into
They Try to give me dap
I step back
Party at Kimba
Man I just can't wait to be king
Party at simba
Cold shoulder
Flow colder
Come get pneumonia
On another level
Don't settle
Dance wit the devil
I'm a vandal
At the back do'
Of the bando
With the banjo
Flow is Mike Tyson
Meets Van Gogh
Cause I stopped listening
Way before you started biting
And I was painting pictures
Way before I started writing

YO!

Back to reality
Got to clear yo mentality
Of every fallacy
Tell them sinners
And infidels
Wish me well Simpleton
I'm sicker than sickle cell
Why lie?
Y'all keep bluffing
And Y'all running out of tricks like
Wala! Poof! Nothing
And I
Am just an advocate
For being yourself
But I might just need an abacus
To add up all these amateurs
Lyrics will really damage ya
Back to reality
Can I have the check please?
Cause you gone need a vest or
An S on you chest when this tech squeeze
Or be a part of Olympia
Heard some scandals bout the pope
And I ain't talking Olivia
We vanity slaves
Willie lynch still
Controlling from the grave
And I promise
I'm being honest
They keep telling me
They like Malcolm
Quit being modest
Cause when yo tape drop
You know it's gone be the hottest
Cause Everybody want it
But you went out and got it

Dreamcatcher!

I'm a dream catcher

Yea
