Talking about a real friend
Set your mind at ease, baby
Ain’t nothing wrong with that

[Verse 1]
I guess we both have seen some brighter days
Somehow the love we shared has slipped away
Still I wanna be the one who keeps you safe and warm
Let me be the one

Although things with me and you didn't quite work out
For you there’s this special place deep in my heart
Though I wanna extend my unconditional love
Let me be the one
Yeah, baby

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

[Verse 2]
Promises made they've all worn paper thin
Still, honey, I'm not afraid to call you friend
Take a look and I know you'll see the possibilities
Let me be the one
Oh

To see you smile, there's nothing I won't do
‘Cause honey I only want what's best for you
You are a shining star, just stay the way you are
Let me be the one

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
I wanna be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

If you need a friend…

[Rap: Q-Tip]
If I see your head hanging down with your pretty brown eyes crying
You know I’ll be the one
Shorty, I’mma keep your spirits wild high at the lowest points in your life
You brighter than the sun
Promise you I’m all ears, it seems that you’se a friend in need
But extremity of our friendships are so real, I’ll heed
To every word that you say, ‘cause true friends don’t play
Here’s my number, sweetie, call me any day
I’m sure that we can make a bad thing get better
Just by talking about it, express our thoughts together
No matter what the situation, guess I can’t say no more
Got your tickets? Well, I’ll see you at the door

[Chorus]
If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Let me be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

[Outro: Q-Tip + (Mint Condition) + Stokley]
That’s what it’s all about
What’s it’s all about
That’s what it’s all about
Let me be…
Just being a friend
That’s what it’s all about
(Just let me be the one)
That’s what it’s all about
Let me be…
Just being your friend, yeah
(Just let me be the one)
Talking about that old soul groove
Let me be…yeah
(Just let me be the one)
