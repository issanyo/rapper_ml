[Intro: M.E.D, J Dilla & Sample]
Yeah
Yeah
Get ready
Push
See you out there
Yeah
Do your thing girl
Let's go, now

[Verse 1]
First seen her at a club scene
High pose, playing with her tongue ring
Big thighs, tight jeans, pink g-strings
Strawberry lips, small hips, no green
High confident, no teen
Bought her boy a free drink, fake smiles bring
Ain't Mary, fronting with her wedding ring
Flash for broke, pie when they bling
Late night fake affection, these erections
Hit blow, sex investment, girl get dough
She throw it like a [?] strip show
Nympho to the floor, bring it back like oh
Too cold with it, sexy exquisite
Want to [?] and grow old with it
But you'll be lucky if you're with it
She's superstitious, too cute so [?]

[Hook: M.E.D. & Sample]
Yeah, work that thang girl, Push
Get your monthly, damn, Push
Five series, whip down that fast lane, Push
Uh, uh, get yours

[Verse 2]
Can't help it, losing my patience
With her anklets all up to her fragrance
Smelling like cherry pie, hypnotise
With cinnamon eyes, it's sweet lies
Brown skin tone, rolling stone, pinky ring
Big stones, always on the cell phone
Always on the hustle
Mama taught how to work that muscle to gain what a man own
So devious, want to be so cold up in the mist
Witness now, women hater
Broke in the door trying to get a major
While she floss seats with the Lakers
Cool girl, you a player, yeah props due
But when you look [?] what you gon do
Two answers, rich baby daddy and nothing
[?] cancer, walk to your [?]

[Hook: M.E.D. & Sample]
Yeah, work that thang girl, Push
Get your monthly, damn, Push
Five series, whip down that fast lane, Push
Uh, uh, get yours

[Interlude]
Turn it up, uh, Push
Yeah, get yours, Push

[Verse 3]
Look, all eyes when we step through
Wheels, raps, songs we got [?]
Til bad, OJ Grey Goose
House full of hoes and they broke too
Now got twenty on it
Got plenty on the it, pour Henny on it
Wow, Just Blaze on the track
Man, gritty on it, whole city on it (whole city on it)
Call the shots, got many on it
Many nine shots at the minivan holding knives
We grew with the time
Learn to get your paper with stacks each time, I
Yeah, control my fate
When the flow go ape, the dance floor shake
You gon feel my pain
Blaze drop the beat, the kid [?] bang
Get back, please relax
We don't know how to act better
Get yours, keys by the stack
Hoes in the back, let's go
Get live, threes in a pack
Damn dog, trying to front get back
Baby girl for the dope, get back
Just Blaze, where you at let's go
