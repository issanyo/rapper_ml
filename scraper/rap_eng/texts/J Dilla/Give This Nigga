Now if you, see this nigga give this nigga respect
That's if you don't suck my dick or sign my check
Now if that's some G shit, I do this in G shit
Frequent, the S clip slick shit that we bent
Yo' ass, tryin to figure how much cash I spent
On that bitch; if it's pussy boy I don't pay rent
You masters cashed the last and all you hold is lint
What is it, yo' ass want a blast my man
Speakin of that blast shit, I just
Got up ahold of somethin I ain't even pull yet
Now that's word, see on a whole 'nother somethin
Next time a nigga ain't no frontin
You know that if you front it ain't no future
I won't, hesitate to shoot ya, with rhymes
I got a lot of them, what you touch, was my lint just
Give me respect and you can press rewind
That's if you wanna, do that
That's if you gonna, do that, who that
It's the S y'all, 3 the hard way
Like this y'all, this y'all
Dee-da-da-da-di-da-di-da-di-dis y'all
