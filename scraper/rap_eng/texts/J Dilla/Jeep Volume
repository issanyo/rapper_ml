It all started up in high school at lunch from a young group
Coming through a cyphers in the one two
Chicks barely knew till my whole crew blew
Just some rapping ass niggas and barely attendance school
In the first place, rhyming 'bout my birth place
It's funny how a [insert car name here], turn to a mercese
Great lakers make your papers
All from the page that we roll up in the .. in the basement
Now we're spending money like we made it big in Vegas
Titty bar light, foreign car lights, born all night
Feeling alright, soon in high flights, got me tourin' wrong twice
Stole in cash twice, born in long nights
Feel the high life standing cooler than the ice
Never had to fool em break rule em on the mike
Moving like a puma when I school em with the price
Never came easy, yo the kid had to fight
Mike Tyse sacrifice everything right
Passion to Christ, with the roll of a dice
Most of them just tight, I'm a pose in the light
I appose to those who pose in the vice
Make you wanna say ..

Boys, when it started that young [?] was just another witness
I never knew that it would turn into my family business
It was just me and my niggas in the basement
Didn't know  that you would leave and come back with the spaceship
New mission get money and then we elevating
Every evening we gone hit the titty bar and celebrate
Hands in the sky, bands in the sky
Sipping on Konyak yeah we Canada dry
And we ain't even counting the losses
My man got on so you know who the boss is
We flossin often , and yeah they know we reppin' the deep
That ain't the only place that we gone be, we gone see and
Who knew 15 years later we'll be putting records taking trips to the equator
Baby girl want me to date her in a Vegas elevator
Still chasing that green and I'm blacker than Darth Vader
We used to check more now we checking to check more
And I will stay hungry like a bony skeletor
Forevermore I will be official with the grind up
Rear view status everybody stand behind  us
So you can find us, makes me wanna say

Boy, wake up hear music run downstairs, take a shower
Wash my face, brush my teeth and brush my hair
But I gotta go to school in a couple of hours
No I don't want to go there, I'd rather eat a  peanut butter jelly sandwich and just stare and watch my idol then just savagely beat my brother while rap to the beat of the cover
Living in a rappers fantasy any rapper kill the beat
In the streets ghetto walk while I roam the streets
See the blues when you walk these lonely streets
Who know I make a career, out of mourning over my brother
Letting all of my tears out, Letting go of everything
Letting go of my fears now
And now we're taking over the globe
Seven years down the road every project we drop put a spear down ya soul
I make the microphone [?] like Britney Spears on my phone
Got the icy ass watch on with the wrong time zone
Think I bought it in cologne
That's the shit I own
On some dope shit you can't even see what I'm on
Make the smoke spin any clock [?]
All you represent my daddy while I'm on the road
Got a bagful of hand me down signs for my [?]
No grip full of them hand me down rhymes for my [?]
And it flows through my blood and I put it in my music so
