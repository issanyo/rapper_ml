Who gives a fuck about old jewels and lessons?
Throw it into pro tools and don't use compression
Fuck a hoodrat and still won't use protection
Yeah nigga
It's hard times, shed tears nigga, don't cry

I'mma live forever never gon' die
It's the same shit as my nigga Osirus
A similar vibe but like still different than the archdiocese
With sinister vibes up in the centerfold section

Sipping dos equis on a foldout couch
Watching 'Equus'
I die for the necklace i don't own
It's five seconds left in this game then we going home
To dissect the five segments of the human eye section like:

Iris, pupil, lens, cornea retina
Preexisting condition got me denied by aetna
But it's cool, though cuz i'm a nigga for life
If it's chicken on the table i'mma pick up a knife

If you posting rap videos i will click 'like'
I reinforce every stereotype, and then I break em
Y'all be treating life like a science experiment
Trying every experience and end up dying at the spearmint lounge

Coming up cuz last year i went down like mary blige
No for real, it was very scary times and shit
Luckily for me i'm an air sign
So i ain't terrified by the them types of things BOI

Not from queens but grew up loving nas so much
Til i got older, then i was like it's Nas so what?!
Growing pains and then going through changes
Came full circle to realize this nigga never wasn't my favorite

Shit, you live and you learn then you learn and you die
And hopefully at some point you got a chance to see berlin
With a wave of the wand like Merlin, it's gone and regardless the world's turning

Hurling a Molotov bottle with the nozzle lit
I seen it all from a tower off the Gaza Strip
Backflipped and disappeared into a smoke cloud
The signals I'm hearing from the pyramid are so loud, it's hard to think straight

Life seems great when you in position
My man used to be a snake by his own admission
He figured he could be a saint if he just wished it
Now he move like Pete rose as if the ban was lifted, damn

Call Cam nigga
YES MA'AM nigga
Call my dad and tell him I'm coming up there to join 'em
Cuz I would rather be dead than broke, that's no joke
And I'm still hoping that I ain't disappoint him my god

What the fuck

All of yall niggas still suck
Just like a baby with his bottle filled up
And the oatmeal up in the bowl is irish steel cut
Place the gun metal gray where the sun doesn't lay

Plus Son doesn't play when it comes to shooting this moneyball
Rain sleet snow, Winter spring summer fall
And i ain't serving up inspiration for none of y'all
With no gun at all, dog, it's just my thumb and all

Four of my fingers gripped up tight upon the mic
Kiss my mother if a nigga die tonight, mothafucka
This ain't realest shit i wrote but it's close
I got some secret diary notes that i'll never disclose not ever

Like heath ledger in the four feathers
It's banging like beat measures when the chorus hit em like
Blaow
And now i'm shooting two from the foul line
Smile now cry later, no frown lines

With two fraeuleins in the crowd tryna to get up
The same bitches that my niggas fucked down at south by
Ewwwuhgghh
Fuck the public outcry
Get money like atlanta black housewives
