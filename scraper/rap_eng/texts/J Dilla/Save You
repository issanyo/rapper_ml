[Verse 1: Joshua]
When the day turns to night
There comes a moment in time
Where we do things that are reckless
Would you still feel young, If we left tonight?
'Cause we both need it, and I know that I'm not the only one

[Bridge 1: Joshua & Akira]
The sun has gone, the moon's to rise
It's time to let go and roam the night
We are young, we can just let go
'Cause they all know that what we do is wrong
And even if we tried, we could risk our lives, let's take this slow
Me and you, and the whole crew, we'd be up all night

[Chorus]
Let me save you, let me save you
We're off on the road again
We're gonna go far until we reach a dead end
Let me save you, let me save you
We can do it all over again

[Verse 2: Joshua]
All alone on the road, listening to the radio;
The same songs that play throughout the day (yuh)
Driving around for some time
Lighting up with you makes me feel so fine, but now
I just wanna see where this all ends, so let's go

[Bridge 2: Joshua & Akira]
As the mountains rise and peaks the morning sun
All the fog begins to clear away
And as the shadows fade
We'll be in the distance a thousand miles away
So why don't you...

[Chorus]
Let me save you, let me save you
We're off on the road again
We're gonna go far until we reach a dead end
Let me save you, let me save you
We can do it all over again

[Verse 3: Mi'Kel]
When Morata hit my line I was finding my goal was dining
Cause the timing  man I was dying I was high writing reclining
But the rhyming I was denying cause I couldn't really find the meaning
But you know me the codeine
Got my whole soul leaning
But I'm usually a stand up guy cause  I'm no comedian
Halfboyzzz that be the team, but it's no diddy
Just some bad boys seizing some Faith but it's no Biggie
But the squad had bitches fall into the bag but it's no missy
I got the green and the peace on my mind cause I'm so hippy (hippy)
210 TX I rep for my whole city
Halfboyzzz you don't know how me move cause it's no bibby
And I'm catching pink cat cause I'm wild but it's no skitty
And I'm reaching for my goal
With the rhyme but it's no Izzy
We got the 6 on lock its Loto wrecking the town
And that was way back when Izzeo was flexing on clowns
And Josh was riding through the city with his head in the clouds
You already heard the bar well we're setting it now and we saving hip hop you ain't regretting it now
I got my dogs with the squad Scooby-Doo because we meddling now, easy

[Chorus: Joshua & Akira]
Let me save you, let me save you
Let me save you, let me save you
Let me save you, let me save you
Let me save you, let me save you
Won't you let me, let me save you, let me save you
