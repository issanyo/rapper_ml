[Hook]
Yeah... It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be this nigga with ice
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be this nigga with ice
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be this nigga with ice

[Verse: J Dilla]
You can bet it like dice, Jay been nice with his
Since Dre said he was a nigga for life
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Is what I'm thinkin when I'm dickin ya wife
Yup, big truck jewels and a truck with tools
You don't wanna pop shit here tonight!
Chain swingin, the sickening ice
I swing it just to see it look sick in the lights
And my shit on freeze, kiddo
Pass pussy and indo please..
For the one who think you M.O.P
I rolls deep with heat-holders that'll bust things in your Jeeps
Hold nuts, so rough, and Jay'll go nuts if you touch the chain
Just because I ain't tucked it, ay, I ain't the fuckin game
Got the thang-thang tucked away

[Hook]
And it's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be this nigga with ice, motherfucker
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be this nigga with ice
