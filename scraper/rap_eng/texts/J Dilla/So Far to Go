Smokin loud, spoken laudz, wrote vowels more potent than the smoke coming out our lungs
I enjoy every minute every last breath
When im pulling on the sess
I see life so precious now It all makes sense
But I can't rely on herbal essence
Cuz then I'd die intermittently when I ain't buddha blessed
Oh god please say yes
Allow us to advance on our quest to find the ultimate question
Who can answer?
The truth is all i asked for
We can't stand much more
What even is there to stand for?
And what's more is I see death and gory matched with epic glory
Man that's just wrong whether it's detonating a bomb on your vest or a drone
What's left is war nonsensical war- centripetal force ending all
That's why we roam to change the world
Man we really can make it more
I gave my whole heart
Till the grave wholesome
And Fade into a new sun boom supernova
Awakened a generation of latent soldiers
May they find their purpose that's within themselves
Manifest they stories dreamt in their slumber
And one day well all get together
And i bet well be saying to each other hey it's all love
Look how we made it- a better place more sunny than Jamaica-
And all smiles in their face now
Woulda have enough but I had to turn it up white lotus all blossomed- style based erased and your face ultra graceful -vibrant- when you open up u exuded such love
