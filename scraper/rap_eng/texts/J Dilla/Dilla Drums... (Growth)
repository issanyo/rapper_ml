[Intro]
The flow sound sicker over Dilla drums nigga
The beat sound harder when QM is on
I know who it is in the mirror now
Yeah, I could feel the growth in me
I sell hope, Lord forgive me
I sell hope, Lord forgive me
I sell hope-

[Verse]
Cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the city on your tongue, yeah that's pure man
Yeah that's him, curtains in the windows
Limo's off rap, who would've thought that?
Look at the wave I just brought back
Hip-Hop back, Hip-Hop back, fax!

[Outro]
The flow sound sicker over Dilla drums nigga
The beat sound harder when QM is on
I know who it is in the mirror now
He-he, that's a good thing, he-he
