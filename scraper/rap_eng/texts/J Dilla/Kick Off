[Intro]
For! Malachite!

Clear!

Uh Huh

We Back

Yea
Yea

[Verse 1]
For the streets and ma home ma peeps it's me holla
Motherland man return like skywalker
Been gone long the game been less hotter
Than that dude underground they say will wear prada
Flow leaves blows like Mo' Ali trauma
Most rap acts is whack I leave drama
What go around returns I see karma
Is a bitch, oh shit no wonder I get harder
Hot like the old Xbox before it pops
Set the promo on fire before it drops
Rhymes like quakes we aim for high richter
Worth 1000 words ma lyrics can paint pictures
I'm comin soon with doom da name Victor
Whether you fantastic or not I'm gon' get ya!
Uh uh  yea!  I'm on get ya
Just like Jax the arm is gon' lift ya!

[Hook x2]
Yea yea

We 'bout to kick off
Head or tail ma nigga I'm 'bout to get off
Ma niggas is on the team
Nobody sent off

Yea yea

We 'bout to kick off

[Verse 2]
Yea son I'm about ma game
PS3 style homie I'm about ma game
PS4 style homie I'm waving a black flag
Cause I'm leaving jaws dropped when I'm dropping a track
In the zone and am killin 'em man
But ma shadow never falls after all see the shit couldn't stand
Laying low in the cut, good luck finding me
Calling y'all out like I own the duck dynasty
Still got that lambo dream 2015
26 still keeping it green with the team
From tha 1st to the 2nd ma peeps it's me holla
That old school brand, releasing new product
Been gone long the game been less hotter
Than that spot on mustafar where Obi got Lukes father
We keep it formal, repping that number 7
This the formal movement this the starting 11
Its the kick off!

[Hook x2]
Yea yea

We 'bout to kick off
Head or tail ma nigga I'm 'bout to get off
Ma niggas is on the team
Nobody sent off

Yea yea

We 'bout to kick off
