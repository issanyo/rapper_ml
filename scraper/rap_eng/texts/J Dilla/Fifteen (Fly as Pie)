[Verse One]
Back in the day i used to rock stretched ears with fat caps
Running with some spraycans in my backpack
Never thought i’d fall for anyone
Til my stupidity made me fall for the wrong person
Tall, dark hair and even into graffiti
Didn’t really care if i was getting treated shitty
Our friendship for perfect
But i simply wanted more, and to try, my insecurities didn’t think it was worth it
Even my friends told me, “he’s stupid"
"why do you wanna get with him?"
But i was young and dumb, and i didn’t listen
We used to paint every saturday, but this one was different
I went in for the kill, and he told me a flat out “hell no"
Can we still keep the friendship? will you wave when i tell you “hello?"
He laughed and told all of his friends
And i was the subject of every conversation
My insecurities are even worse, can’t they just come to an end?
Now i realize nobody wants to be more than just friends…

[Verse Two]
Now let me tell you about this guy
Stretched ears, snakebites, bands shirts, stands about 6 foot high
He introduced himself as “yo my name’s richie"
He was a 10 in the looks department so he really fit me
Tattoos and spraypaint were his forte
Smoked a little weed, but it didn’t get in the way
Super funny, super chill, thought he was perfect
Especially when i used to see him sleep shirtless
We became super close til one day
We were at my cousins house
Blowing clouds in large amounts
And he asked, if we could see each other on that serious tip
Nervous, i said yes, but never been in a relationship
We moved fast, on that elevation shit
He lived too far, and i wasn’t into long distance
I was in love, sprung, and my friends were my witness
I would glow, blush everytime that’d we me mention his name
Not to mention he was on top of his a-game
I fell for someone, man i felt like ashamed
Then one day, i woke up and it was a dream
Cuz nobody really wants to date me!
Now was richie was real, but the relationship was a mirage
My head was going crazy, a minage
Looking at him got me contemplating marr-iage
We stayed close homies after, and i even hinted, but i sure he ignored it
Now why does this always happen if i’m a good person?
Just a guy that passed me by
