[Hook 1: Black Thought]
'Riq Gees, that's what's up

You know my niggas keep it ghe-tto, twisting backwoods up

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I got a shit load of story tales up in my sack
So let all the drums and all the noise interact
Twist up a fat one and make my coffee black
The Grim Ripper, th-th-the boss is back
My nigga, fifteen minutes minus five is a dime
To jewel it or not, it ain't a problem to shine
It's why my man Dilla do it without even tryin'
The greatest hip hop producer of all time, dig it
We back on the job, having a good time with it
You gotta love it, we got it, you still tryna get it
The footprint in the booth on every continent
Step off the stage the whole crowd, that's our hostages
And our sponsors is my marrow lynch mob
Hands on a long double barrel that the trench hide
Tired of being outside, breaking inside
First motherfucker that flinch, he getting french fried, yeah

[Hook 2: Black Thought]
That's what's up
Frank'n'Dank, that's what's up
'Riq Gees, that's what's up
You know my people keep it ghe-tto twisting backwoods up
Krondon, that's what's up, yeah
Kweli, that's what's up
Ayo Com, that's what's up
You know my people keep it ghe-ghetto twisting backwoods up

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
From the smoke of the basement to the pickings on the roof
I rock the house from out of solitary booth
I'm raw like the fury I instill in every booth
My name Black Thought from the legendary Roots
Guarding the gate, ill vibe off them snakes
Up in them sweepstakes, I'ma give these cats something to taste
Shot glass full of chemical waste
Mollywop smirks off your face
You get lurched off the base
Outside of the world premiere
Tusslin' for a parking space
To get a glimpse of the IMAX Theater rhyme creator
Deep concentrater, black activist agitator
Contemplating the outcome of engagement
Keeping patient, moving like a secret agent
Mic like a ball and chain, a lab calling my name
What the fuck, I'm 'bout to muscle the game

[Hook 3: Black Thought]
It's 'Riq Gees, that's what's up
Gulity Simpson, that's what's up
Madlib, that's what's up
Yeah, keep it ghe-ghetto twisting backwoods up
Dilla Dawg, that's what's up, yeah
Turn it up, that's what's up, yeah
That's what's up, yeah
We keep it ghe-ghetto twisting backwoods up, yeah
