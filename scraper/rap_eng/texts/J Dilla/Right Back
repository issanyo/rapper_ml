[Verse 1:]
I stand before you as a man who’s more you
Meaning I don’t shine my star on the floor you
Keep all my awards and plaques in boxes
Which keeps my wall from saying I already got this
Which keeps my humble on the pride the softest
Sob sound reversed the passed the noose
Known for all my lyrical complexities but
Not for all the daylight joints I produce
Survived many moons and sunlight reflect it
So in dark times my rhymes like deflect it
Occasionally eclipsed my transgression transmitted
Still real talk watching a man spit it
There’s nothing wrong with one being a door man
So own the building but how about own the floor plan
So the children can have a place to play
And open the box to admire the plaques for a day

[Chorus:]
We put it down like that
How y’all n*ggas get a sound like that
For the fans we had to give it right back
People think this is easy as it looks (I’m feeling you)
We put it down like that
How y’all n*ggas get a sound like that
For the fans that they give it right back
People think this is easy as it looks

[Verse 2:]
Damn it seems we’re the most slapped on
Fuck them other n*ggas no limit Master P song
Pete the other day we running rings like a tree trunk
Add up all the years I’m the OG of the G funk
See my position was to kill em with consistence
And I did it over extended and
Yes I lost some members and I miss them
I just beat the nine if I didn’t I’d be tripping
Trying to bring the light to your existence
To melodic form I was born gifted
I ran a long distance to bring it to your system
Ever since his mother kissed him
Tried to bring the wisdom
Represent change how you diss them
Ain’t it hella kinda strange where they list them
I’m not a victim
I’m just tired of n*ggas who say they know about yelling
But they don’t know but they feel it the realest
They spit it like the foundation builders
With a sound so phat
My 96 raps I can bring that shit back
This is axe on four fast can relax
See my past is a fantastic pass you can ask

[Chorus]
