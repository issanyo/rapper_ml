[Intro] 60's Batman Theme song

[Verse 1: Batmann]
Investigating the relevant, hella bent, collecting evidence
Excavating celestial elements, intelligent, knowledge from the gods, wisdom heaven sent
Blinding aura like the sun, blessed speech is eloquent
Elegant, cool dude move smooth like the president, leader of the new school
But flow, just like a veteran
I swear I lived my whole life before, but in the present tense
A genius who perceive through his soul, smoking this medicine
So let em in, barging through this door like an elephant, it's evident, spiritual lyricism is excellent
My, syllable rhythms a testament to this effortless
Imitation is nature's version of Etch-a-sketch
Liberation I'm waking outta this fukin bed
Illustrating, creating for all you knuckle heads
Humiliation, starvation is what we up against
Get a job, puff this cess, credit card, stuck in debt
Me? they gon have to catch me, before they take my rights they gotta blast me
The government will do a nigga nasty, they'll take a nigga's cream and leave em ashy
Inject the poison in his stream call it a vaccine, while they take a nigga's dream they wanna trap me
But knowledge is the key to moving crafty, while you elevate your team like the star athlete
