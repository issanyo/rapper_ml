Such a pity, to see my whole city
Shape shiftin and changin itself
Into an industry Of cowards
Sittin up in towers, lookin down on the town
Controllin with their power
Clock in, your lunch is only half an hour
Lets build that, lets build this
Knock down those trees who the fuck needs oxygen?
Like they're above the O-zone, stuck in a vaccuum
Where the only actions they make Will only consume
The lives of the people who built this place
Not the people in power but the people they hate
Step on their juggular until their necks break
Gotta get legislation so we can put this rail in place
But we don't got that kinda money, our whole country
Is in a sticky situation like we're covered in honey
And the bears are coming, along with the wolves
A nation of sheep, perhaps we need to shed the wool
Over our eyes, so we can see the bigger prize
A beautiful nation for our future kids to reside
In my country is where I wanna place my pride
But When shit goes wrong congress takes it all in stride
Like "Who the fuck are you, what do you want me to do?"
Present a solution, dont sit and bicker and argue
I worked for the state and didn't benefit
I got experience, but there's still a hole in my pocket
Never once did I see workman's comp
Too scared to apply, I thought I'd lose my job
For smokin on a bit of green every now and then
But, nation, why does a simple leaf
Cause such complications?
And why the fuck can't my homie pick where he's stationed?
Growin in the system fucks up so many relations
Everybody under pressure cause they want a career
Spendin tens of thousands on college loans every year
We should be educating for free
Get gritty, hands on, like it used to be
Cause I could use a master, an apprenticeship
To teach me symbolism with syllables, and how to flip
The meaning of a song to connect with the masses
Or how to raise a fist when a new nation clashes
With its own ideals, under martial law
Oh damn you didn't know? Sorry to drop the ball
Police Force becomes militarized
While the government is force feeding us lies
And the devil's pulling strings from the other side
Don't tell me that there's no New World Order on the rise
