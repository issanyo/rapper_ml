[Intro - Jay Luse]
I'm just playin...shout out to Faith
Cutie with a big booty

[Verse 1 - Jay Luse]
Remember when I seen her had to bless whoever seed ya
Put her on this Earth just for me to seek her
Please her, tease her, and never leave her
Little mama was the baddest muy caliente
How I seen love? I don't know I'm only veinte
I love how you walk, I love how you stare
When you walk in the park, wind kiss on your hair
Should I talk to you now? Should I talk to you there
Love float in the air
Baby you on it your lifestyle's gorgeous
Cautious, milky complexion plenty affection
Introduction formation
I'm calculating placement, my heart keep racing
I'm chasing dreams with our kids on the swings yeah
She notice me, it'd be love at first site yea yea yea yea...

[Verse 2 - Tevyn Jynx]
Aye how you doing baby girl my name is Tevyn (Hi)
Did it hurt? (What?) When you fell straight from Heaven?
See I always wanted to say that to see the response that I'd get
Even though I know it'll be a hit-or-miss
And I ain't tryna hit miss, I'm interested in fitness
See if we can work out and if you're with this
So persistent, and relentless, get this
You probably looking at me like I need to mind my business
And according to statistics, you probably got a guy
But I'ma risk it, I'll treat you like 'Your Highness' not a mistress
You kill the competition everyday I am the witness
I sex you with my eyes, no protection, and I witnessed
Your perfection, Caramel complexion
I'm scared of rejection, that's why it took me all this time
To say what's on my mind, I mean just look at you
To be this fucking fine, the judge must throw the book at you
Every time I peek at you, you shock me like Pikachu
And if i keep my eye on you, you turn to Raichu
I ain't lying boo the only lie I do is lie with you
Pack a bowl with Lauryn Hill on and stare into the sky with you
Well I'ma end this with a red cherry on top
Dead bolt, you got my mind on lock fa'real doe

[Hook - Jay Luse]

If we do it we can do what it do
(I think I love her)
Yea-yea-yea

Now if we do it we can do what it do
(Oh I see ya, I see ya)
If we do it we can do what it do

[Bridge - Bruce Parker] x2
She, she-she-she got my seed inside her
I just know she got room for me insider her

[Verse 3 - Bruce Parker]
Can't, can't wait to get my D insider her
She need meat inside her, carne inside her
And I'm being modest
I, I-I, I asked a question, "I'm guessing you want Mexican?"
Softly, the words came partially with "Yes" again
Parked the whip properly with my left hand
Off we go to order from On the Border
I'm straggling behind thank God I found a dime, fine ass
Kool-Aid in a wine glass with lime, 'splash'
Don't this date let time past
And if you ask me, she define 'class'
And if you ask me, she make the rhymes last
Well-wished for a nickle and got a dime back
Girl look at the menu before he round back
Drama issues, blissful, I won't find that...in you
A plus sign pack cuz..


[Bridge - Bruce Parker] x2
She, she-she-she got my seed inside her
