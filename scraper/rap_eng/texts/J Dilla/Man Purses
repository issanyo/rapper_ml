[Intro]
Uh, I'm curb certified
I ain't like the rest of these dudes
I'm curb certififed
It's the Cons, fool

[Verse 1]
I ain't into man purses
Or the bland verses
I put more emphasis
On what the fans purchase

I hear your canned verses
Over "Runaway,"
If they ain't wild
The new dudes ain't got nothing to say

But what's the sense in having
Soldiers who kick bars
If you can smell the
Odor from the discharge?

Vaginal secretion
Might as well live up with Ms. Garrett
Up in Eastland
Cos I guess the Facts of Life are
When you're drowning in debt
And need a life guard
Cos the only time you cop
Is when the bike squad pulls up on the corner
And you show 'em where the crimes are

I feel like Ty, saying "Move that bus,"
I tear the house down
Or any groove I touch
Meaning I crush any and all competitors
So soon it's gonna register:
You can't touch the kid like sexual predators
So notify the editors
Inform all the column readers
I got a lot of heaters
I separate myself from the bottom feeders
Cos a lot of leaders expect followers
To be yes-men, cocksuckers and swallowers

What the problem was?
I wasn't made to quit
I'd rather rock the boat
And make the sailor sick
And the one common thread that's in the tailor's kit is
My crew ain't been the same since Amber Rose & Taylor Swift
