[Verse 1: Kid Krule]
A bird with a broken wing cannot fly, considered useless to a stand up guy
See to that bird, the limit is the sky, but for me I'm trying to make the most of my ride
I devote and I strive, for me to reach greatness
A burden placed on you, cause' you lost the last latex
Baby Mama, trying to bring the drama. Minimum wages, he trying to stack the commas
But secretly she knows that it's her fault, and in her mind she knows that she's fine and smart
Cause they don't really care about the zygote, cause they just wanna see a fuckin' paycheck envelope
And they dont know what the pain brings, corrupt bumblebee cause the pain stings
And lately a nigga been thinking about all the fucking levels and the rankings
Of the system, I would miss my niggas but it's damage when I'm with them. Instead I fell victim to the rhythm
Of a kick and a snare, had the nappy hair, I was sitting on the Culdesac I never was a square
Never play fair, that's what the world taught me. Pain, hunger, that's what the world brought me
I'm here to let you know that there is hope, you could be the one nigga that will end up dope
You could be the trendsetter of the group, you could be the smartest nigga on the stoup
I'mma show you, living proof, of a person
That made it out, of poverty and still emerging
Forever learning, wisdom and knowledge. Never judge a nigga by the degrees in college
You can't judge a place by the color of the nation, politician statements yall lost in translation
Sabotage the rat race, I'm at another pace
Heart break leads to heart ache, snakes in the garden better keep ya' yard safe
Look at what they did to scarface, so check it
So check it
I spit this reckless

[Verse 2: Kid Krule]
Child of abyss, grew up round' some hypocrits that really didn't give a shit, grandma trying to make me quit
Smart as hell, but never got the grades or passed shit
Work ethic low, lone ranger in the classes
Only thing I was worried about, was this rap shit, experienced the gutter boy I'm trying to dodge this trap shit
But can't dodge all the forks in the road, when everybody knows that you trying to go global
Trying to go global, ain't Nike how I'm trying to go "soulful"
You do the most, I do more than most dudes, used to have canned foods but still had a hand full
Misery loves company, suddenly, in the streets all I see is puppetry, puppetry, puppetry
Can't you see? Talking eat, just gluttony, gluttony, gluttony
How can it be? That a nigga feasts and wastes, when there's a person right next to you, dead laying on his face
Man the shit is mad depressing, anti-depressants, harder to confess if a bullet's in ya' chest
Like trying to reach the best, never mind the rest, Cops just arrest forcing cardiac arrest

[Bridge x2: Kid Krule]

People just oppressed and obsessed, with the fact that, niggas manifest their whole life with the shit they possess
They will never digest or request, an educated guess, if they took it all away tell me what you got left
Tell me what you got left
Nigga
