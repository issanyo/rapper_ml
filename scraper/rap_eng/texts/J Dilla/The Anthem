[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (28!)
It's Time!

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
Who is it?
McNasty and niggas from the block to the bar
For the rimmy on the rocks
[?], V-I-P, straight to the back
B-I-T, C-I-G, shake for the stacks
I place with the kick with the case to the black
One straight to the face with an ace to the jack
Let it pass 'round to my mansion and we DRINK UP!
Drink off on gans and Rémy, UH!
Get the hand, get the gin, get the crisp served
Get the pen, get the yens, get the picture
One to the two, gun to the shoot
Take boys in the club with funds through the roof
We got chips and clips with the grips
Sick with the lips, with the lip, with the fist
Uh, what the tip say? [?]
Alright, alright, gimmie the hook, the hook
Party people, yeah!

[Hook: Frank-N-Dank (J Dilla)]
To all my Detroit players, say we F'd up!
To all my women in the club, say we F'd up!
And if you're sipping on some, say we F'd up!
They didn't know what the crook say, we F'd up!
(All my live niggas hit up at your door, let's go)
(Front to the back door, say) We F'd up!
(Chicago, Philly, San Diego) We F'd up!
(Brooklyn, Saint Louis, ATL, go!)We F'd up!

[Verse 2: Dank]
It's going down in here, my nigga pass the liquor
We get F'd up, we get asses quicker
Cause it's, D hard [?]
Get 'em all F'd up [?] the hardest
McNasty way, baby, that's what's up
And I'm looking way gangsta with my plastic cup
With the Rémy in my left hand, bottles speak out plenty
Fat booty, F'd up chicks, we got many!
Frank Dank and Dilla, nigga, that's what's up!
We get live in the club and you all know (We F'd up!)

[Verse 3: Frank]
F'd up beyond all recognition
Tryna get this life [?] thang in position
And I'mma keep it gangsta like I'm Tony Soprano
I'mma hit that thang gangsta have a singing soprano
You can call me Busta-Bus as I ([?])
And now with some mustard I (loosen the [?])
You know Frank [?] take them clothes off
Move by the case, no white, [?]
And who got a light, it's time to spark
Smoke a doobie with a cutie grab a booty and a [?] like
That's how we do it, it's McNasty!
And when we get F'd up we get nasty!
Hey!

[Hook: Frank-N-Dank (J Dilla)]
To all my Detroit players, say we F'd up!
To all my women in the club, say we F'd up!
And if you're sipping on some, say we F'd up!
They didn't know what the crook say, we F'd up!
(All my live niggas hit up at your door, let's go)
(Front to the back door, say) We F'd up!
(LA, Japan, and DC, go!) We F'd up!
