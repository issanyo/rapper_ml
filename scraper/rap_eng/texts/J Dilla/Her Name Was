[Verse 1]
Yo, I kinda miss your smile, and everything, yeah
Kinda had me for a while, got me thinking damn
But if I had you for a second, would I keep you long?
Don't believe in first impressions, we were on the phone
Imagine if you were a person maybe we could last
Spitting albums dedicated strictly for your ass
Now I'm sitting here staring at this hourglass
Writing lyrics on whatever that we could've had
I ain't mad
That you found another intellect
Mentally drowned by the sound of you in this text
Somebody tell me how it now, really what is next
Should i try to keep a smile, and forget the rest
And this picture of you, wow, you in this dress
I've been fiending for a while, gotta take a breath
Niggas know it ain't my style to be trying to stress
Over a girl that I really never even met
Come outside for a while, at your doorsteps
When you talk, you can't tell me I'mma be your ex
Lately I've been really thinking on our future, man
I know you probably really thinkin' that I'm stupid, man
Give me a chance
Please come outside, girl
Just wanna talk about the things that I hide, girl
It's like you suttin' that I've really never even seen
Them jeans, that smile, the vibe that you really bring
Then I seen it through her blinds, bruh
My heart beatin', thoughts racin' through my mind, bruh
I get to see you again, this waste of time, bruh
Open the door, a nigga was right behind her
