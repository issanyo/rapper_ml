[Intro: Busta Rhymes:]
Somebody about to be punished
Rest in peace to my nigga Izzy
Rest in peace to my nigga J Dilla
Rest in peace to my nigga J Dilla
Rest in peace to my nigga J Dilla
Love Y'all niggas man
Watch what i do when honoring y'all name
Streets feel me!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I'm nice with the lead peel your edges like slices of bread
Precise, become a poltergeist, stickin knives inside of your head
What's the issue, on a roll, like a roll of toilet tissue(?)
I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial
I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once i blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, im wildin', pile up my money so kosher
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the Costa Rica area level, my features and carry my posters
[pause]
Unprecedented, i cemented, you changing your flow up
While helping you grow up, niggas know you for sounding so tore up
Challenging niggas, better hold on to your bannister niggas
Fuck around i'll stuff your body parts into cannisters niggas
Like you don't know the half, i'll bust your motherfuckin ass
Busta buss, cass, and papoose is fuckin psychopaths

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Making Niggas Wanna Get Hype Yo I'm PSYCHO [x8]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
My nigga beside me with triggers and niggas get bodied
I lock a strip and chop a brick like im Mr. Miyagi
But this ain't karate, i been sick since i pissed in a potty
I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hammer man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And i do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines i be layin' clowns down like futon's
With the bullets in the rocket, my pocket's is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam, keep the steel in my hands like wolverine
[Busta: Congratulations on the -- Cass. Welcome home nigga!]
Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level
I'm locking the kettle man, i'm hot like a pot and a kettle
On the mic i spaz, who get as hype as cass
And my nigga busta, we some muthafucking psychopath's

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Making Niggas Wanna Get Hype Yo I'm PSYCHO [x8]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I'm an iceberg trapped in a fire i won't melt
I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, i won't be killed
I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm Bedstuy
I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible i won't lie
I'm the code of silence in the Gotti crew
I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, i just bodied you
Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakaze through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap
I stay with the oowop strap
I put your baby daddy in a body bag
When i squeeze and let the wop clap
I Baghdad(Bag That) like Iraq
[Papoose: Hold up lemme put my gun down. Busta Rhymes: Ayo i know they trying to figure out what you got going on Pap]
This is my era, you niggas is losers
I'm the new era(error) like a mistake on your computer
Got the infrared dot, bustin' you gullible suckers too
Put a dot on your ass like www

[Chorus:]
Making Niggas Wanna Get Hype Yo I'm PSYCHO [x8]
