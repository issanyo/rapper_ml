[Intro: Cypress, Ashely, Daishanay, & Makaila]
Cypress: None of you guys know how we feel. You guys-
Ashely: But when you guys came into her life-
Cypress: We've been through so much, and you guys just wanna mess it all up
Daishanay: we just tryna and we're just tryna just keep it-
Makaila: Only, only, the only time-
Daishanay: and it seems like we can't do that cause you guys want us to just bring it  up
Cypress: you wanna know how this whole started? It's because I been ignoring them, all because of you! All because of you! That's why she's crying

[Verse 1]
She said
These thoughts can trace back since daycare
You know the things I'd do for straight hair?
Momma this ain't fair
Why am I different, why do they stare?
Why do they laugh when I bring coconut oil to school?
Damn
I chose the white Barbie dolls, I couldn't tell you why
But my collection emphasizes shame I try my best to hide
Cause my reflection makes me cry
My complexion makes me try
Extra hard for their acceptance cause I'm less in their eyes
I know I'm less in their eyes
So now I'm less in my eyes
This really mess with my pride
It didn't help when I grew up I'd be objectified
I learned there's not much room for love when you're just sexualized
So get your hands off me
Get your hands off me
Get your f-
How come they don't love me?
How come they don't love me?
How come they don't love me?
They love my features, they don't love me
Appropriate my culture but they call me ugly
Oh now you like my hairstyle? bitch I'm flattered
White feminists only speak for themselves, they know my life don't really matter nah
But y'all will never understand
I never knew my dad, I never got love from a man
So I'm a slut if I give up what you expecting of me?
But praise a man's body count, yall double standards disgust me
So don't you ever fucking judge me
I just wanted someone to love me
But men of color don't even want me
Cause I don't fit the image they've been conditioned to lust
Damn, congratulations

[Hook]
Cause now I hate myself
I wanna change myself
Until I ain't myself
Til I ain't myself
Until i
Til I ain't myself
They made me hate myself
They made me change myself
Until I ain't myself
Til I ain't myself
Until i...

[Verse 2}
She said
Ever since my grandparents made sure we'd have a better life
We in America now, so you gon do whatever's white
Give you a white name
Better get you a lil white boy
Speak spanish in our house, but when we out
You better get it right
I used to hate my middle name, lemme tell you why
My friends can't pronounce nothing from my culture I try my best to hide
Micro-aggressions made me cry
My complexion made me try
Extra hard for their acceptance cause I'm less in their eyes
I know I'm less in their eyes
So now I'm less in my eyes
This really mess with my pride
It didn't help when I grew up I'd be objectified
And when I thought it was love, I was only fetishized
So get your hands off me
Get your hands off me
Get your f-
How come they don't love me?
How come they don't love me?
How come they don't love me?
They don't love me, they love the idea of me
Crazy Latina they saw in porn or from the movies
So use me however you dudes like
Preferably white
I need my kids to have blue eyes
But damn
But ya'll will never understand
I barely knew my dad, I never got love from a man
Did I confuse consent with what's expected of me?
Wish I could tell them no, but they never respect it from me
Damn
So don't you ever fucking judge me
I just wanted someone to love me
But men of color only gon want me
If i submit to the role that they've been taught to control
Damn congratulations

[Hook]
Cause now I hate myself
I wanna change myself
Until I ain't myself
Til I ain't myself
Until i
Til I ain't myself
They made me hate myself
They made me change myself
Until I ain't myself
Til I ain't myself
Until i...

[Bridge: Cypress, Ashely, Daishanay, & Makaila]
Daishanay: Well when you hurt us, and then, when we, if we hurt you, and we hurt your feelings, and then we just laugh at you
That's hurting your feelings, you're hurting our feelings, because what you been doing
Cypress: What if it was the other way around huh?!
Makaila: Now you, now you see, why, you come and you say mean things about me and Cypress-
Cypress: i bet right now, all that we're talking right now, you guys aren't even getting a little bit
We're just talking and talking, and it's going just right through your head
Daishanay: You guys obviously don't care
Cypress: I just bet you, that after this day, you guys aren't going to do anything about it
Ashely: And I don't want that to happen
Makaila: I want everything to stop...

[Verse 3]
But this year
We found a new form of resistance
I had to unlearn everything I've been conditioned
So then I learned to love myself with no permission
You can't lessen my existence when my beauty is intrinsic
And I will no longer fall victim to your ignorance
I know my purpose, know my worth, and my significance
And being ethnic brings attention on it's own
But look at my beautiful brown eyes you can see my soul
Cause I know
That God love me so I love me
Said God love so I love me
Said God love me so i love me too
I been in touch with my Creator
I don't need no other savior
So trust me I don't need you
I don't need no man
I don't need your romance
So don't try to manipulate me
I know your whole plan
I know this patriarchy and capitalism thrives off my unhappiness so that's what I'm fighting against
No I'm not against men, I'm just against the man
But every man is privileged, check yourself and take a stand
I don't hate white people just hate white supremacy
White ladies ya'll got privilege too so do you really stand with me huh?
I been underrepresented my whole life
We been underrepresented our whole life
So don't ask me why I'm so unapologetic
And keep your respectability politics we don't like nah
So try being a woman for a week
Better yet a woman of color for a day
No you wouldn't last
But ya'll know freedom isn't free
But free your mind and you'll no longer be a slave
You gotta love yourself

[Outro]
I had to learn to love myself
So don't be mad when I love myself
Nobody love me so I love myself
I know you hate it when I love myself?

I had to learn to love myself
So don't be mad when I love myself
Nobody love me so I love myself
Why do you hate it when I love myself?
