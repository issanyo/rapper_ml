[Verse 1]


(Niambi)
No one is enemy to water
That’s OSHUN, yeah the goons
Giving dudes some time to ponder
Don’t you wonder what it’s like?
You lying and you scheming
Just to say you won the fight
Oh, you wanna fight? NA
Tell your girls to put they hands down
Y’all don’t want that work
Tell your men they need to stand down
I keep tryna tell you, you don’t wanna see no man down
See if I put your man down, tell him he can lay down
Kiss him on his neck, I promise I can make him go down
Do you understand now?
Y’all don’t want no showdown
I won’t put these hoes down
I don’t even know how
I’m just tryna keep the peace
Please, I can show how
I guess I stepped my game up
Broke a couple hearts
Cupid never got his aim up
I told you from the start
Baby, I’m just tryna lay up
And maybe save up
And in a couple years
I’ll call you if you wanna wait up
But, if not I understand

[Verse 2]


(Thandi)
See baby you don’t gotta hold my hand
Just know that if you do, I’ll take you to the promise land
The motherland
Momma’s boy I’ll hold you like your mother man
No one is enemy to water
Two fire signs still smooth like the water
See hatred might’ve taught her, ego might have bought her
Pour libations for her sorrow
No disrespect boo
We’re here to protect you
Love you and help make things clearer
Help you see the beauty when you look inside the mirror
But, don’t get it twisted Shango got a temper and since I’m his lady misses
And you know I love his tender
Baby he’s a god so know that you’re not his contender
Yeah we squaded, but we’re still showing love
Please don’t take it personal it’s just guidance from above

[Chorus]

No one is enemy to water
