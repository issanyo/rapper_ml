[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

First off when I get on the beat
My purpose to make you wanna go willow your peak
I'm of a, different world but I'm not Kadeem
They Jar Jars, I'm All-Star Abdul Kareem
Uh, I sit back and just vibe to instrumentals
Catch my high, Sky walk, droppin rhymes like Mace Windu
Eight missiles couldn't blow my high
They so average, I got atheists like Oh My God
I'm on my rise but feels like its almost time
And I'm the polar opposite of Tony Romo haha
Snappin on beats like bo did bats
Going bananas thats ape shit my Mojos back
I, found my calling and i, picked up the phone
When you gettin this great thats some shit that you can't ignore
So, when everything falls into place
Ima smile and sit back because everything's great but for now

(Hook: I gotta take yall to school, I gotta take em to school (8x)

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]

I'm in a class of my own
I wrote some ill rhymes that could pass for some known
Veterans, in the game, I'm just a little advanced
Born a visionary but feel I really deserve a chance
And ima get it, my rhyme style prolific
Speaking food for thought, blind people everywhere could feel this
In this game I'm bound to be Jesus Shuttlesworth
I wrote scriptures everyday until my knuckles hurt
I'm tryna live my life a day at a time like the Huxtables
I'm droppin bombs and I ain't never been to afghan
From no fans to coastin now these fools is harassing
Surpassing the average, im your Honors Underclassmen
