[Hook: Pat G]
My life oh
Every hour spent under the clouds, my life oh
Every hour under the clouds, my life oh
Every hour spent under the clouds, my life oh
Every hour-

[Verse 1: Pat G]
All day most definitely
My way til the death of me
Hear what I say and remember me
Feel like the realest of the century
Free living you can really see
Where you are and want to be
From the ground to the podium
If it's ya boy then you'll know it's him
Bringing joy before the future dims
Real McCoy on the fucking blimp
All of these women coming with the pimp
Playoff game this ain't a scrim
Sometimes not sure what'd we do
Nodding me head to this groove
Trying my best to pull through
At least what I know is true
Did it all just for you
Today's journey we get to

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pat G]
Every day is a blessing
Stop a minute with the messing
We've all been there stressing
Can easily be depressing
Playing the tune you better sing
Won't use my life to miss anything
I stay living under the clouds
Keeps your feet on the ground
Thoughts go better with this sound
Rely on Pat G to break it down
And when you look around
Hip-Hop will be proud
It's what I've got to prove
Best beats for the mood
Trying my best to pull through
At least what I know is true
Did it all just for you
Today's journey we get to

[Hook]
