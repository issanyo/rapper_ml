[Verse One]:
Some people relieve stress with violence, police sirens
Or maybe isolated in silence
Or maybe on a tropical island overlookin' the ocean
Maybe in your new car coastin'
Some write lyrics
Some visit the priest to fight spirits
And some don't quite get it
And go insane
Staring down the neck of a rifle
And squeeze cause they went psycho
Fade to black
Some use drugs and don't make it back
Like fiends, beggin' for free packs, now he in debt
Some have sex to sweat it out
Some let anger build up and let it out suddenly
Some hit the bars and split cigars
Steal a set of wheels and go and strip your car
Whether you broke, or got a meal ticket
Stress is a motherfucker homie, deal with it

[Hook]:
My mind is gone away
You can try to hide but you can't deny it
I still see it all on your face homeboy, you stressed out
When the stress don't go away
You can try to hide but you can't deny it
I still see it all on your face homeboy, you stressed out

[Verse Two]:
To survive nowadays takes a lot of endurance
No pay day, no income, no insurance
This enough to make a man feel hopeless
So every other month another shut off notice, damn
What you mean I can't reap no dough?
Like my baby girl feet don't grow
I gotta provide and still puttin' money in bullshit rides
It's hard livin' when your hands is tied
Behind your back
So I calm my stressed mind with 'gnac
Contemplatin' pushin' dimes of crack, it's that crucial
I'm sick of prayin' over Ramen Noodles
This ain't the lifestyle brother tryin' to get used to
Some hit the bars and split cigars
Steal a set of wheels and go and strip your car
Whether you're broke, or got a meal ticket
Stress is a motherfucker homie, deal with it

[Hook]:
My mind is gone away
You can try to hide but you can't deny it
I still see it all on your face homeboy, you stressed out
When the stress don't go away
You can try to hide but you can't deny it
I still see it all on your face homeboy, you stressed out
