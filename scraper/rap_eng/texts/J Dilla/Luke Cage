[Verse 1:]

I promise you, I said that I could never play the fool
The chains are broken now the jokes on you, Hi-Five (Hi-Five)
Turns out the soul you're after is bulletproof, yeah bulletproof
Running I could barely crawl, my back was against the wall
Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe (You washed)
White as snow (3x)
All my sins you washed white as snow, white as snow
My soul is bulletproof
My soul is bulletproof

[Verse 2:]

Nothing can separate us from you love and grace
Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe (You washed)
White as snow (3x)
All my sins you washed white as snow, white as snow
My soul is bulletproof
My soul is bulletproof
