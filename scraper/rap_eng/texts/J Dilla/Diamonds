Bling bling!
Keep me on shine while I make the ching ching!
You so precious, like a burst of joy
I heard your boy Jacob got the best shit
You so hot you make me hot
Boy, and he's got you 'round the whole watch, boy
And so expensive, but well worth it
I heard it's a Dilla that prints some
It's so ugly when the ice lit
You with me, the feeling is priceless
You so beautiful when you in the row
It's something awful, what you do to the poles
You ain't guess then you ain't listenin'
I'm flossin' with my girl's best friend (diamonds)
Shinin' with my girl's best friend (diamonds)
I'm blindin' with my girl's best friend
When I raise 'em in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
When I raise 'em in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
Bling bling!
You with the whole team, get the pearls on the ding ding
They see the shine, they eat it up
They see the flow, but they can't see the time
You so sparkly, if you ain't a part of me
It's like the rock is for no Barkley
You so hard, I'm gettin' there with no prob
I mean the women give me gold stars
Oh Lawd! So special
You multi-facetted, you can cut glass wit it
So brilliant, go spend a little dough
Look like you sold millions
Plus you everlastin'
And drastically important
When sportin' your ghetto fashion
You ain't guess then you ain't listenin'
If you stay glistenin' then just shake your wrist and
Just shine with your girl's best friend (diamonds)
Rock and blind 'em with your girl's best friend
Wildin' with your girl's best friend (diamonds)
It's D.I. and your girl's best friend
When I raise 'em in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
When I raise 'em in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
When I .. in the sky
Shine so bright, it'll blind your eye
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Rollin' wit you until the end
