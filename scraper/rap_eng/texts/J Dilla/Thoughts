[Intro]

Self conscious
Stuck in a room
Filled with mirrors
And can't seen the difference between I and me

Beat the wip to your body
Like slave masters watching how your knee - grow
Swollen

And what's the truth about kony
Feels like everyone desieving
Convinient how election time's on
So the gps is finding everyone

Light skined getting tan's from the sun
Dark skin lightening up in the moon
Where I dwell about the days that i've been passing through
Closed minded

Go hand in hand
Like Saudi thieves after being charged
No batteri's included
Even south park got a starving marvin

Used to listen to happy marvin
Whispers through the grape vine
Check signs
De la, untill I found this line like

" my religion man you'd be more like god
But you steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scales converting to ismael"

-- I took a pause
I thought about it
Native tongues were speaking through my mother tongue
But not through my mothers tongue

Respect all
Ya' now a days, teachers got that - less-on
Practicly naked and not from that truth
No, oldschool thoughts being cought

Penetrating the youth
I got these questions
Why they don't pay dj's more for their work?
While my man wants paper cuts

Clearly more than 10
Closing my inner vision windows
How my curt-ends
Cover the lies that everyone got a good heart

U playing in lifes game
Im leading in the league
Of extra ordinary gentleman

[Hook]

Roaming around with thoughts in my mind, my mind
All about reflections and questions
Filled with signs
Twist and turns when I lay my head at night
From ideas to concerns
To how this world will alter

[Outro - in swahili]
