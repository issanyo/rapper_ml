The donut is our lives, we repeat the cycle till we die
The center hole is our eye, the crumbs represent time
We're losin some, they fall onto the floor known as earth
Making sure future generations have more time than we did at birth
Cuz theres problem after problem in our daily routines
So we only fry the dough when we open up in the spring
New life, spring represents the grand opening of the Bakery
We expose ourselves to new people and they taste our new flavoring
College, grown up, the popular-ist of the donut
Workin for the bosses, the bagels, that chose us
Work hard everyday for something also known as sprinkles
Next thing your lookin in the mirror and you start to spot the wrinkles
Your gettin stale, and you're munchkins are startin to look like you did
And your lover Coffee's gettin sick, none of his beans are being rooted
Retired, you're face never to be seen again in the shop
You'll never be sold again, but the bakery sales won't drop
Cuz theres new generations of flavors, new cravings
But you're crumbs will always remain, the chocolate covered glazing
