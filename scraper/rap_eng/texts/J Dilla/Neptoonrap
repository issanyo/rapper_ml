You are now tuned in to the motherfuckin' puppy
Toby the navigator, rapper slayer
Toby the fire breathing dragon


[Verse: tobythepriest]

But you don't want war with the dragon
I'll split your mind open with the sword that I'm grabbin'
Roarin' as loud as a boar in a cabin
I come through with the force of a sorceror rappin'
Running with the lions in the land of the thunder
Mass devastation by the hand of the gunner
Mad innovative with a mask on his face
The gritty rap kinda tastes like little daggers when I mumble
My reign will make an evildoer cower and fold
The priest spit knowledge when I'm shrouded in gold
My body got the wrong mind outta control
So I sift through the heavens til I find me a soul
And make him rock with the coolest motherfucker in the galaxy
Vaporize foes into mist when they challenge me
Vocabulary is suited to break gravity
A knight with a shank, I'm a one man cavalry
Strength when they heard this
Drink when they heard this
Brag about my power from the banks to the churches
Brag about the future when I travel to the seventies
The priest spitting sermons to the serpents on the levee
On Dauphine, make you wanna turn back time
Mr. Sandman buggin' when he heard my rhymes
Sleeping on the kid, then awake with a kiss
But sleeping beauty can't breathe with a blade in her ribs
You fucking done yet?
Take a comeback
Southern California lookin' at the sunset
Half the people in my life didn't know I could rap
Open your ears muhfucka, man I'm doper than crack
Now I was blessed with a brain that was molded at Olympus
Juggling the lightning, entertaining little children
My purpose on Earth is to expand your mind
And build castles on the motherfuckin' sands of time
Now do you follow?
Possess sorrow
But I know the sun will probably shine tomorrow
And I hope there's somebody on this planet that could love me
Lately I been lonely, so I kinda want a puppy

If we're being honest
