[INTRO]
Ay, make sure you tell the doctor i need more pain pills aight?
This fuckin knife is in my arm and shit, ay if you gonna take that make sure you bring it back though cause i need it aight? deal
Aight I'm recordin now

[HOOK]
Yo, I'm steady trippin' of this world that I'm livin' in
Full of phony pretenders, and punk mothafuckas thinkin they can be my friends

[VERSE I]
Burning inside is what i feel, neglecting the perfect for me, cause im tryna stay hard as steel
But whats the deal
Now im roamin through the lonley road, sittin in a dark corner blowin herb smoke through my nose
Im tryna figure out where i went wrong, stuck in an intersection trying to find my way home
Now im smokin on this mothafuckin remedy
Tryna be somebody who i ain't meant to be, but can't you see the pain that i hold inside
You wonder why im so heartless at times, cause im afraid that this love is gonna me blind
But at the age of 15 i died up inside
Weve came a long way from eating beans and rice
My momma told me "this life was nothin fuckin nice", so we do whats right

[Chorus] x2
So, I'm steady trippin' of this world that I'm livin' in
Full of phony pretenders and niggas tryna be your friend
But they dont even know this shit is trife
You got back stabbin niggas thats wantin to take your life (real quick)
