(Verse)
I used to think about it late at night
Still contemplating ways we could've made it right
I would've fought for you but that's a losing fight
Ain't it crazy how my wrongs proved me right?
But years passed, car crashed, new girl, fatter ass!
Threw us in the trash
Guess everything ain't suppose to last
So I see you when I see you
And after this year girl I wouldn't wanna be ya
A couple more shots of patron, you can hear that real shit in they tone!
Don't even hit my phone cause I'm gone
And girl I'm on
So you can leave a message at the tone!

(Chorus)
But What Was I Thinkin?
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
What Was I Thinkin'
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!

(Bridge)
And we just go
"On & On & On" yeah

(Outro)
But What Was I Thinkin?
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
What Was I Thinkin'
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!
What Was I Thinkin Bout You x2
You Played Me Like A Fool!
