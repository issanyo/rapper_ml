[Verse 1: Loui_D]
This is an invasion of your peripheral plus your rare view
Equipped with the lyrical molecules of air too
I meant 0'2 that causes a reaction
The type that make you walk off the building just like the happening
For these maple tree rappers who lyrics filled with sap
Similar to sugar but smoothly coating the facts
Sticky raps in this race you will slack
Against this lyrical cartoonist bonkers with raps
Like an underdog making a comeback
Hitting with individual raps striking like a thunder cat
Cause i'm trynna make bread with these wonder raps
And shake my head at the sleepers who make fun of naps

[Hook: Loui_D]
"who got more style" that's what the question is
Cause the subliminal answers is stressing them effortless
This is a vibe of confidence for the record
Cause the illest lyrics got em lit up like a pair of sketchers kid

[Verse 2:Loui_D]
These lyrics go hand in hand like ganja and Jamaicans
Cause i keep it smooth like the fronto with the papers
It's apart of your balanced breakfast when you wake up
It's healthy for your ears you can call me Mr.Quaker
Smiling on the box with the shape up
Kellogg's with the flow deliverin' frosted flakes cause
"they're grrrrrreat" yes down to an inch of a crumb
Fillin' with sentences, nutrition's and acronyms
As i continue to stride like everlasting gum
And hitting with every single tactic of a savage one
Man army blasting the track with the mass destruction
Causing lyrical madness when i mash the button
