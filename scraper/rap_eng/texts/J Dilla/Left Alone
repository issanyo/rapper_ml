[Verse 1 - Noveliss]
We livin' in this time behind enemy lines
Everything else sublime, my mind and every line
Relaxing my state of mind with Roy Ayers on the vinyl
"Everybody loves the sunshine" now turn the lights low
But can't help but feel like, Malcolm behind the blinds though
They gentrified your city and now you part of the sideshow
Constant state of rage but they'll never see us panic
Chemtrails got me feeling fatigued but I eat organic
They don't even want us on the planet, our world is damaged
Cash rules everything around except my family
Understand me, march with the women on behalf of my daughter
Land of the free, they'll build us a wall, don't fix the water
The true taste of defeat, they feel like they got they shit back
Trump signs and confederate flags right where you live at
True colors come out through...social media actions
How you love rap but still get disgusted by Pro-Black shit?

(Hook)
Sometimes I wanna be, left alone but not alone if that makes any sense (x3)
Sometimes I wanna be, left alone but not alone...

[Verse 2 - Noveliss]
You lack mind power, first it was the TV but
Now you get your thoughts and feelings from wikipedia
Land of the free, home of the brave
Freedom of speech, land of defeat, home of the slaves
If I gotta look up the...street from my crib see confederate flags flapping in the wind
Fuck the national anthem again and again
I don't know which ones the right thing
Chasing higher education in the place of my dreams
Can't even find my degree, the family decree
You following lies kids, student loan vice grips
Suit and tie 9 to 5's wondering where your lives went
Same place where your eyes went
When following the vision of another business to make another man richer became the scripture
My mother broke the mold when, she raised me to changed the picture
But I may have spent, too much time adjusting my focus, wasn't indecisive
Just got caught up in some life shit, couldn't let my Mama down this was my way to continue writing
It's a riot inside the writer, the Midas lines
It's gold in my hands like 3PO holding his own head, I'm out of my mind...
