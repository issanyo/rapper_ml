[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Won't take no coffee instead
Don't think that I need to say it
I'll have that knowledge in bed
The cause is so far from dead
My words are nutrients take these vitamins all to the head
I think you know what I want
I'd be surprised if you don't
You knew my life from the jump
No need for playing along
That shit be takin' too long
Father, I'm eggin' it on
Keep looking if you're looking for average
I'm living proof, a human covered in magic
See he equipped with wings, but he ain't give me the guide
So when that shit hits the fan, I just give it to God
Don't fear no bitch or no man
Won't take no look at your hand
Give me a mission, go ham
I power up like Gohan
Gohan... [yea (x3)]
These niggas cloning, Lohan

[Hook: 6LACK & India Shawn]
Should you stop believing?
I could be your reason
It could stop the bleeding
Dive in, deep in
Da da da da

[Verse 2: J.I.D.]
Seem like I been killing shit and I can't miss
Beam on that 40 boy I can't miss
Every chick in my past? can't miss
Whether they're in love, or say I ain't shit
Teeth show, the game spit, fangs lift
Spent some change for a change
Out the hood, same nigga
Mhm yea boy that shit dangerous
Let them folks import, implore, deport, T boys, C4
Then bomb, we run, what's happening nigga re-run
Lord knows Ima live it up because I know this is the eon
No pressure because I been here since it begun
Seen fire made, seen animals extinct and decayed
Adaptation & remade
Seen God's people become slaves
And it's still fucking with us till this very day
I been looking up to the sky respond s'il vous plait
See you say you love me, I don't see you daily
Seen your son on the cross and he beat to blue and black and grey
Seven days, and then he raised
Now put your hands up to the sky the very fucking same way
When you see the cops, hands to the sky, same way
See what I'm saying? I'm kinda saying the same thing
I'm saying, I'm saying mane

[Hook]
