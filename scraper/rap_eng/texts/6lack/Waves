[Verse 1: Normani]
Thank God for the weekend
I'ma go out with my friends, I'd rather let the liquor sink in
Than the thoughts of you that I should not be thinking
When I'm with someone else, it's feeling like I’m cheating
I just might go off the deep end
When I’ve had too much, can’t shut me up, now when you start to creep in
Know that everyone is sick of all my reasons, I-
I let you come and go like seasons

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
First I blame you, then I want you
Fucking hate you, then I love you
I can't help myself, no
When I have you, wanna leave you
If you go, that's when I need you
I can't help myself, no

[Chorus: Normani]
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, yeah

[Verse 2: Normani]
I keep on going through the motions
But we ended long ago, I should be numb to these emotions
But you flood my memory just like an ocean, and
And I was drowning in devotion

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
First I blame you, then I want you
Fucking hate you, then I love you
I can't help myself, no
When I have you, wanna leave you
If you go, that's when I need you
I can't help myself, no

[Chorus: Normani]
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour every day, day, day
You come in waves, yeah (You come in waves)

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
(Yeah)
I come with ups and downs, yeah, I know
If you tryna ride, ride slow
Deep breath for the tide
Hold tight for the stride, I can see it in your eyes
I come with monsoons
Made love on the full moon, yeah
Wave like water, not a trend
If we start it up then this'll be the end (Start it up)
First I love you, then I hate you
I won't dare try to replace you
I ain't crazy, no (I ain't crazy, no)
I'm ecstatic, then I'm sad
On a high then I crashed
'Cause you made me so (Damn)

[Chorus: Normani & 6LACK]
You come in waves, waves, waves (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Every hour, every day, day, day
I hate so bad that you come in waves
You come in waves, waves, waves
You come in waves, you come in waves
Every hour, every day, day, day (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Normani]
You do, you do, you come in waves
You come in waves, yeah, yeah, oh
You do, you do, you come in waves
