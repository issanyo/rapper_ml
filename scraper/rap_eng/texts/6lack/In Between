[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Stop trippin' over me, yeah
Gave each other something to believe, yeah
Instead of sellin' me a dream, yeah
Just tell me what I need, yeah
Friends claim they wanting what we got
But little do they know, it ain't sweeter
Forgetting all the friction when we high
A little smoke will make you a believer

[Chorus: 6LACK & BANKS]
I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm livin' in-between
Already tried to leave

[Bridge: BANKS]
Ask me for space, I told you, "No"
You said to leave, I said, "Fine, I'll just go"
You told me, "Wait, why would you leave?"
You used to fight for me
And I just wanted all your attention

[Verse 2: BANKS & 6LACK]
Already got me sayin'
Baby, I got no patience
Give me one conversation
I can be soft, you can behave
Already got me sayin'
Baby, I got no patience
Give me one conversation
I can be soft, you can behave

[Chorus: 6LACK & BANKS]
I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm livin' in-between
Already tried to leave
And I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm living in-between
Already tried to leave
I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm livin' in-between
Already tried to leave
And I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm living in-between
Already tried to leave

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
I think I'ma need a minute
No picking up, it's time to finish
Think you wanna be replenished
You hanging on to every sentence
Yeah, you was all good
Until you misunderstood, yeah
Make that ass float
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
