[Verse 1: A2]
And you ain't got to tell me man, I know they hate us
Tippin' money like I know the waiter
Mommy text me I got no behavior
I had to skip the country, I got no more data
It's all in time I swear it's soul forgiving
She think it's mine but it's chauffeur driven
It's cold inside 'cause I'm known for chillin'
When you get inside it's like a sofa's in it
When they hit my phone they get the deadest tone
Sleeping on me, hope it's memory foam
I dashed the weed, I nearly missed the boarding
I hate this feeling, I ain't never home
It's hocus pocus when I get recordin'
Watch me run this like I'm Kelly Holmes
I need a medal for it, so it's set in stone
I'm smellin' louder than a megaphone
But I got focus with it
Fee's a shooter without Colvers with him
I'm a known magician
New gen but I'm old edition
Couple new friends got some cobras with them
So I hold a distance
All in one when I go golfer with it
I'm the only one, you know I'm so specific
I pass the wave on like an old tradition
Me and Wonda cooking till they close the kitchen
Got a lung full of haze, I got sons throwing shade
But I'm in France with a French chick
In Pigalle doing French shit, she said my mind's like a maze
I hate it when they're desperate
The come up's looking like Leicester's, always try it never test it
You living life like them restless
You live nice, we don't mention, I'm highly amazed
Wait, 'cause I'm the same shepherd, different sheep
The same method, different week
The same message, different beat
They think I'm sleep but I been awake
I been eating, check my plate, I been eating, check my weight
You know I'm feeling great, it's me and Sam talking real estate
Its always been this way, it's red wine with this fish fillet
All these songs that I give away, its gotta happen
More contracts for the spasm
I move like Tetris with the patterns, they won't get it if I @ 'em
The spliff pulls smoother than satin
These are six bills shoes that I'm sat in
Front row seats doing fashion, got no heart I need passion
When I make a move it ain't random, I planned it
I'm out of this planet I'm on Saturn
Word

[Hook: 6LACK]
Kill 'em all
I could tell by they faces that they didn't expect me to
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I could tell by they faces that they didn't expect me to
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
(fucking get off my dick)

[Bridge: 6LACK & A2]
People from the past on my phone line
Don't they know I'm having no time?
And you ain't got to tell me man, I know they hate us
People from the past on my phone line
Don't they know I'm having no time?
And you ain't got to tell me man, I know they hate us

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
I put this shit in perspective
I pride myself on not being that young and reckless
This year was my first time down in Texas
I'm in South by and everybody got they fuckin' mouth wide
East-Side nigga
But the way he hit them 808's you think he South-Side
Don't let your nouns and your verbs be the reason you fuck around and stumble
'Cause there's no where you can run to
I push keys like gun do
Couldn't see that I'm reading through 'em like a psychic nigga
Clearly you are not the brightest nigga
Everything I touch is Midas
I am being biased, I need fuckin' silence
When I'm in your city bitch I make a moment
I'm in Poland with a bitch who rolling
And that ass poking like she using waist trainers
Tummy t-shirt, not a weight gainer
She will tell you I'm a face painter
See I got so much shit to say but ain't got the time
And you got so much shit to say but ain't got the spine

[Hook: 6LACK]
I could tell by they faces that they didn't expect me to
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I could tell by they faces that they didn't expect me to
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
(fucking get off my dick)
