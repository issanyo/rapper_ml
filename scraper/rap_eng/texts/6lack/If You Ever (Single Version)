[Verse 1: NAO]
It's about time
Maybe we’ll make it, no
Save your light
And somehow we'll make it glow
And everything will be alright
Just trust 'em and let it go

[Pre-Chorus: NAO]
There’s a stairway to heaven
And maybe we can climb to them
We're both a little scared
We're both a little scared
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

[Chorus: NAO]
(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

[Verse 2: 6LACK & Both]
Lately I, lately I been thinkin' 'bout perspective
You don't have enough fingers
To count all the blessings that this love'll bring
'Cause this love’s electric
Angelic halo on tilt, it’s a look
Stairway to heaven, got the elevator shook
Where I'm from, if I take you to the block
You the one, revolve around you
I ain’t plannin', for the sun don't shine
Doesn't matter if you see it or not
Hoping that you change your mind ’cause I need it a lot
It's like, I could use my words or my actions
You could use your charm or your magic
It's one in the same, girl I wrote the game
I've been through the same things so I know your pain
Can tell that we're both a little scared
But now we moving on out here

[Chorus: NAO & 6LACK]
(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

[Bridge: NAO]
Baby I could show you something better
Show you something better
Maybe we could be forever
Even through the stormy weather
Pull you out the clouds
I promise you I'll never give up
On us, for what
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
Yeah, yeah
Would you like to go with me? Yeah
If you ever change your...
Like to go, like to go with me

[Chorus: NAO & 6LACK]
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
