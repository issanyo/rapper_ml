[Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired
Yeah

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
How you gon' dump me and then leave wit' my hoodie?
And you ain't comin' back, give me back my hoodie
And now you tryna make a scene at the movies
You really wanna act, bitch, we at the movies
I want my money back, I'm leavin' for goodie
And I get mad, I don't even wanna be here
And you get mad 'cause you don't even wanna leave here
And now it's bad 'cause we ain't even seen the previews
And now she mad, takin' shit to social media
And I just need you to tell me how you feelin'
And I just need you to come at me wit' real shit
Botherin' people 'cause we fightin' in the dark, yeah
We ain’t gotta leave but we gon' sit a seat apart (Yeah)
Uh, tears in the bucket of fuck-its
Fightin' and fuckin' and tusslin' and fightin' and fuckin'
Lovin', lovin' unless you lucky
I fuck wit' you because you real and you beautiful
But still, starin' at the screen only thinkin' how I feel
For real
I wanna share my popcorn wit' you
'Cause I won't eat the whole thing
But you still got an issue
And I been tryna sip yo' drink, meet the kid in the middle
But no, boo you, she just goes to the car
Pull up, she drove, didn't open the door
So cold, outside
And ya boy need a ride
Oh God, it's really a problem
And I'm so tired of

[Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired
Yeah, I'm tired, baby

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Hey, how you gon' leave wit' yo number on my phone bill? (Bill)
Look inside yo' wallet you got one bill (Bill)
Never got a job but you want chill (Chill)
Girl, that shit is unreal (Unreal)
I'm feelin' a little sluggish
You think I'm entertainin' all the rubbish
It's a no from me, dawg
I guess I gotta let you free fall
Flippin' through my shit like we in a gym, naw
I'm talkin' my shit 'cause I'm off the Hen', dawg
If I, uh
There ain't nothin' left to admire
I been listenin' to Mýa like woah
Don't you let the love turn to pyro
How you let it drag on? Spyro
Goin' 'em at right hand, spirals
I'm seein' Z after Z after Z
He, wait, who after me, huh? (Huh?)
Wait, don't actually explain it and I don't wanna know
I'm tired every time I come home
She all alone, it ain't my fault
I'm livin' life, she in the dark (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't got no bite, a lot of bark
I clear the room, so we can talk

[Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
Tired (Tired)
That makes two of us
I'm a liar (Liar)
Where's the truth in that?
I can't figure how you run your mouth
You been so down on your luck, and stuff ain't lookin' up
You need somethin' that's takin' you higher
Maybe you're out of touch in a rush
And life been kickin' your butt, but that ignited your fire
And baby, it's when you're spillin' your guts
You don't trust me, love me
'Stead he call me a liar
Oh baby, you really hate me, you can't be
You need for somethin' to say
'Cause, little baby, you tired
Tired
