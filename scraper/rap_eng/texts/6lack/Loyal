[Verse 1: Katie Taylor, Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
Are you all mine?
Or am I an imposition to your night life?
No emotion equidistant
It don't feel right, it don't feel right, it ain't alright
Would you go there?
And censor every piece of us like we weren't there?
Existing in the moment
Till it's over, it's over, it ain't over

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
Don't break no promises
Give me your word, honor it
It feels like, feels like

[Chorus: Katie Taylor]
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby

[Verse 2: Katie Taylor]
Is this false hope?
I'm calling California like it's my home
But you ain't 'round the corner
It's a hard fight, it's a hard fight
Have I lost mine?

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
Don't break no promises
Give me your word, honor it
It feels like, feels like

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor, Katie Taylor]
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby

[Bridge: Gerard O'Connell]
Don't you know wrong from the right?
Thought you were good for the fight
I don't want this kind of life
So can we please get it right?

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
How about you?
I said, I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
I've been so loyal, baby
