[Verse 1: Sabrina Claudio]
Take care of me
Talk all day then at night fall in deep
Stimulate me
I want you mental and physically

[Chorus: Sabrina Claudio]
I belong to you, you, you
I belong to you, you, you

[Verse 2: 6lack & Sabrina Claudio]
Don't come my way
If you ain't here for love
Don't you dare, stay
Put some time aside I'll set vibes in LA
It ain't strictly physical but I know that
I wanna lay where you lay
So I think you should fuck with me, yeah
Be the one to take me out the street, yeah
I can give you everything you need, yeah
Need you in my reach, yeah
You know I fall really, really deep, yeah
You can put your lovin' where I speak, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Claudio & 6lack]
Baby, I belong to you
I belong to you

[Chorus: Sabrina Claudio & 6lack]
I belong to you, you, you

[Bridge: Sabrina Claudio & 6Lack]
Take care of me
Talk all day then at night fall in deep
Stimulate me
I want you mental and physically

[Chorus: Sabrina Claudio & 6lack]
I belong to you, you, you
I belong to you, you, you
I belong to you
