[Isley Brothers Intro]
Hey girl ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
And she said
"You a god-damn lie"
I ain't mean to say that shit girl I was god-damn high
So we left the crib now we in the god-damn ride
She lookin' god-damn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the god-damn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you"
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'mma sip on this drank, it's easing my brain

[Hook: 6LACK and Childish Major]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

[Verse 2: Childish Major & 6LACK]
Now I'm like
It's a god-damn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby you the god-damn flame (you the god-damn flame)
Trust me it's love, but I ain't no god-damn saint
You blame me for every damn thing
I wanted to help you and see you shine
But you wanna god-damn rain
Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like, why you do that?
Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck, but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'mma sip on this drank, it's easing the pain


[Verse 4: Jace]
To all the ladies in the place who like wine and bake
Allow me to state that I am Jace
A nigga real
You can recognize it or despise it, but..
All the real bitches gonna like it.. 'Cause
I'm a hometown hustler, love the way I'm fuckin' her
Serve her like a customer, I'm 21 bustin', no
Ain't too many flexin' like this, get your muscle up
Pull up at The Twelve, hop out it's a bunch of us
Just in case little mama really think I'm stuntin' her
Girls on your line all the time when you coming up
And I could've chose your friend, but I chose you
It's a blunt, lit shit, what you gon' do?
Tell your girl to roll through, ask if they can roll too
Finally got Backwoods I can't roll those true
So meet me halfway and just grab that ashtray
And do what my ass say

[Outro Hook]
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
