[Verse 1]
You tell me get away
But you don’t mean that
You tell me leave you alone
But you don’t need that
On my own too
"Honey I don’t need you
Look at how I’ve grown
Im a big girl
I can do it by myself
All on my own"

[Pre Hook]
So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face

[Hook]
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
No no

[Interlude]
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why

[Verse 2]
I tell you let it go but you don’t want to
I ask you what the fuck you want
Just say I want you
Are you crazy
You could have it all
Why settle for me?
You're doing good
You should keep going
Don’t back pedal for me

[Pre Hook]
So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face

[Hook]
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
But maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
But maybe I ain't working enough
Ain't hurting enough
No no
