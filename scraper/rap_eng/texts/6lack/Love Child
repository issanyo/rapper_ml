[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Overlook me, underrate me
Probably hate me
Really you should thank me
Get up every time I fall on my face
Like I was plankin’
Tell me what they thinkin’
Don’t want the accolade
This is the 6LACK parade
Smart people follow after me
Is that why y’all attackin’ me?
I want the love child
I am the love child
Do you want the love child?
Here comes the love child
It’s crazy ‘cause even when they aim with hate
I deflect it and aim away
Had the chance to change ya fate
But I change my ways
You know, you niggas can’t relate
So I wanna know
Where is the love child?
White man said I’d never be loved, child
That I was here to go to jail and be a thug child
Run a, run a hood ’til I catch a slug child

[Verse 2: M. Mereba]
She was from the motherfuckin’ corner
Ain’t she sweet magnolia
Niggas pack heat like furnaces
The bitch got flipped like pancakes
Bitches hate on ya when ya menstruate
She want posta’
‘member what she composed of
She is the love child
Was she the love child?
No you’re the love child
For sure you the love child
We came up from the dirt
The depths of the Earth
The blessed and the cursed
Where less is the mores
Where niggas the most
We lost what we most
So self remorsed
And I am a love child
So you ain’t finna see no fear in my eyes
Sent from above child
‘Cause we never feel no fear in this side
Peaceful but still keep a piece
I pray when I’m hoping to see
I know that it glows around me
I’m not what they hoped I would be

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
Eat, pray, slay, say, show, go give love everyday
Make your way, make wave
Love child, love hurts, love pain
Love fiend, love slave, love me and you gay
Lovingly the normal way
Smack my face and walk away, damn
Uh, I thought this was love child
Playing little games acting like a little child
We break up and you saying I’m a scrub now
Wow damn, pow scram, loud downstairs
And it’s looking like y’all want the bear
I’m hoping there’s more dope in here than you showed me
I’m hoping you don’t show me
But meanwhile, right now I could be
I could be your love child

[Hook: M. Mereba & J.I.D]
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child

[Verse 4: Jordxn Bryant]
It always feel right when it go right through
You the only one I get a whole night to
You could see the passion in the way I move
Same shit different clearance, deja vu
From the Earth with a curse with the seance crew
I flow through the sky with a radar too
Got will too strong to let J.R. shoot
I’ve been living in the middle with the chaos too
Blunts power, gun powder, run miles just to get away to the moon
Sun’s power, lungs dying just to inflate from the doom, gravitate to you
Nightmares to dreams, whispers to screams, dark nights I’ve seen brighten some things
By any means, God bless the Queen, God bless the King, the love child is me

[Hook: M. Mereba & J.I.D]
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
A tip from the child
A drift from you now
Come plummet on down
Slowly coat my tongue
To where you run from
Can’t escape the shadows
Afraid to become
Afraid to be loved
How could I be loved?
Why should I be loved?
My mouth always full with my foot with my love
‘Cause I ain’t ever really satisfied
And I don’t really want but everything
Put out could see the side of mine
And that’s a recipe for my demise
‘Cause I never had a missing piece
Swear I never ever really need a thing
But that is the love child
Showers the tears
To baptize my peers
Now bring me the mud child
No can’t stop the rain
No can’t stop the pain this sent from above
You’ve got to have love
You’ve got to have love child
But lust is the flood
The trust is the words swept under the rug
Until we are loved
Until we all learn
