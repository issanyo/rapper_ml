[Intro]
Yea
Merry go

[Verse 1]
Get it together, shit hit the fan
I know you can do better
This wasn't in the plan
We've been here before yea
Why does it feel like i don't know ya

[Pre-Hook]
Hesitate
But im too late
Participate, concentrate
I try to leave
But you made me stay

[Hook]
Now the room's in rotation, oh no
Said the room's in rotation, oh no
Like a merry go round, round, like a merry go, round
Merry go, like a merry go, merry go, round

[Verse 2]
Nauseous baby
Somebody point me to the bathroom right right right right    now, right now
Be cautious baby
Your circles gon' hurt you
That cycles gone work you out, out

[Hook]
Now the room's in rotation, oh no
Said the room's in rotation, oh no
Like a merry go round, round, like a merry go, round
Merry go, like a merry go, merry go, round

[Outro]
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
