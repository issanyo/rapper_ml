[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Look in the mirror if you're looking for that one little thing to ignite ya (ignite ya)
You've been the realest and you didn't even notice sometimes I feel like ya (feel like ya)
Don't give yourself all the credit, you deserve the world and I might just (I might just)
Wrap it up, sit it right inside your hands, say damn, its just like dust (just like dust)

[Pre Chorus: 6LACK]
I never doubt ya (I never doubt ya) ooooo
I know too much about ya (too much about ya)
Its approaching the hour (approaching the hour)
Hope you remember your powers (remember your powers)

Once you move onto your next stage it'll be unlocked girl (unlocked girl)
And everything that you thought you couldn't do, you'll try girl (you'll try girl)
And you'll be able to shape things how you see them in your eye (in your eye)
And now you're sitting up high in the ocean looking down at the sky (at the sky)

[Hook: 6LACK x J.I.D]
Need some assistance I'm your guardian forgot to mention I'll be at the door yeah, (I was waiting on you at the door)
But every fall I'll be there to break them all you dont have to meet the floor yeah
Once you arise, you gon blind them with the light, baby you put on the show yeah (put on the show yeah)
They all the same we've been waiting for the change I know you can crack the code yeah (you can crack the code yeah)

[Verse 2 J.I.D]
Love me or leave, don't leave me in limbo
I'm a bit in DC cus my feelings change with the seasons
I still crackle the leaves, I float away with the breeze
Seen the heaven in from the high end in sight of an eagle
Its kinda left left and I ride for the people, I rifle the people
Put my life in the line, and I'll die when it's time
A thousand beyond, the earth agrees with mostly everything that I demand
I set myself as down and I know that its kinda new to you (so do you do you do you do)
The false and true is up to you but lie that in the manual, um
I was trembling with my demons, caught in between lawyers and schemes
Weight of the world heavy, I can't handle it, um
I just let that wick burn till the candle was done
Heart banging on my chest, don't bang with a drum, um
If I'm sick as I need that thermometer
As I try and kill imma save my Andromeda, save my Andromeda

[Hook: 6LACK x J.I.D]
Need some assistance I'm your guardian forgot to mention I'll be at the door yeah, (I was waiting on you at the door)
But every fall I'll be there to break them all you dont have to meet the floor yeah
Once you arise, you gon blind them with the light, baby you put on the show yeah (put on the show yeah)
They all the same we've been waiting for the change I know you can crack the code yeah (you can crack the code yeah)
