[Verse 1: J.I.D.]
A lot of hair on the pussy, I can't see it like Sia
You should shave that shit, and I'll wear it like a mink
Kill the pussy, now they gotta call PETA
No animal cruelty
I been just waiting on my cut like a jewel thief
Ye'en in love shorty
Coudl've fooled me
Raised my nephew but he could've schooled me
A pure child showed a nigga how to be true to me
Let's not get too deep, cause this our first time
I'ma dumb it down, nigga this my nurse rhyme
My verse in cursive adverse the divine, signed with my signature
Out of my mind, smoking good gas in the lituation
Gotta a whole zip for the situation
All black, you can take a picture baby
With a middle finger, tell em we don't give a fuck cause we know they hating
If they want war, tell 'em go when you read
Head nod, let me know when you ready
The way it's looking, now this shit could blow any second
Tryna drive, you don't know where you headed
Just let me know when you ready
Look bitch, you guessing, that shit evident
Hypothesize yo' motherfuckin' experiment
Come back strong on your Marion Berry shit
Risk embarrassment, but uh, get the check

[Hook: 6lack]
Hand on the bible, other on the rifle
I wouldn't take another step, that's if you know what I know
I'm sitting here trying to calculate
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
I look at everything around and I feel if I don't get it right this time, then I fail
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle
Main chick, main chick, main chick


[Verse 2: J.I.D.]
No hair on the kitty, shit bald like chemo
J.I.D., Larry, Michael Jordan, Kobe at the free throw
J.I.D., lion, leopard, tiger, sniper with a rifle on the Eiffel, African, fish, eagle
How statistical, I got a big ego
Never seen an animal like this before, started with one style
Then I switch the flow, got an ol' lady, but I make this beat me ho
I just squeeze the load, yeah baby, I'm nasty
And you remind me of Skin Diamond and Cassie
And if you love my bark, then let me bury my bone and you can bring that shit back like Lassie
Voila, magic, frantic, frivolous, mischievous friends with the indica
Living life lavish, likewise learning life lessons and letting shit happen, pray to god from Sunday until the sabbath

[Verse 3: 6lack]
Why everywhere we go, them ladies flock like a pageant?
And it don't help the fact that I'm ?
It's holographic
I be trying to keep the peace, they want me to do the damage
Damn, like please let us get the cabbage
And blow that purple like radish
Damn, bitch, holy smokes, roll the dope, hold the coke, we ain't trying to overdose
All I know is get it all 'til you overload
Coma, coma, coma, coma, 'til I'm comatose
She want that family life with a rock in it
I lean so hard I had to rock with it
No commitment shit, commitment to the game and I don't think it'll ever change, change, change

[Hook: 6lack]
Hand on the bible, other on the rifle
I wouldn't take another step, that's if you know what I know
I'm sitting here trying to calculate
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
I look at everything around and I feel if I don't get it right this time, then I fail
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle
Main chick, main chick, main chick
