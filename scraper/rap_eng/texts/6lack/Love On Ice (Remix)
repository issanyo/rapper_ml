Whoa Kenny

[Verse 1: KEY!]
Yeah, don't let it make you or break you, huh

When it ricochet ting, huh, on the same thing
Put my bitch in Celine, I mean Céline, huh

Fix your face and clean your plate, uh

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Came through the smoke blowin’ with you, yeah, the big pack (Big pack)
Word around town, nigga got big racks (Big racks)
Big cash (Big cash), big love (Big love)
You look like Beyoncé, maybe I had too much to drink
Drunk in love (Drunk in love), need love on ice (Love on ice)
On your bitch like, like white on rice (White on rice)
Clean up nice, book a flight
Roll the dice, can't stay the night
Don't want no bougie bitch unless we on our shit together
Chanel drip, make 'em slip like she Cinderella
So East Side, pull up the ride
Ready to slide, I don't get tired
Love on ice

[Verse 3: KEY!]
Stiff arm like Julio
What the fuck did I do to you?
Got me jumping through hula hoops
When I don't feel like losing you
My heart Antarctica
Switch it up like audible
Take back, no take back
You say you love me, do you mean that?
Stressed out, where the lean at?
Ballin' like Arenas
He broke that's anemic
And right now you don’t need that
I wish they’d try to stop me
Selena and I'm Papi
Coast like Amalfi
They count me out, but I’m counting

[Chorus: KEY!]
Love on ice (Love on ice)
Love, love on ice (Love on ice)
Love on ice (Love on ice)
Love, love, love on ice (Ayy, yeah)
Kristi Yamaguchi, huh
Your love got me goofy, huh
Got me acting stupid, huh
My heart Johnny Dang
Kristi Yamaguchi, huh
Your love got me goofy, huh
Got me acting stupid, huh
My heart Johnny Dang
