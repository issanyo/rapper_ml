[Intro: Tierra Whack]
Nah, but, listen, I'm following my dreams, I'm chasing my, my, my, my dreams, uhm, accomplishing all my goals. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. And that's, you know, niggas, they always gonna be there

[Verse 1]
Really hate saying sorry
Gotta be another way
I know you hurt regardless
Tryna take away the pain
I know I've done some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
Checking myself, 'cause I just can't ignore, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

[Verse 2]
We over the same shit
Swinging for the fence, but somehow I can't hit
You wonder why I came here
Despite a couple kinks, don't no shame hang here
I know I've said some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
A lot of shit that you just can't ignore, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Do all this work only to fuck it up
But I'm not down for quitting on your love
It's twisted but I just can't get enough

[Post-Chorus]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

[Bridge]
So I'ma write, when I'm wrong
Haven't I already shown
What it's like to love someone so much
You treat their heart like it was your own

[Post-Chorus]
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

[Outro]
Rights, wrongs
I'm just tryna s–, oh
Feels like a fracture, bones, oh, oh
