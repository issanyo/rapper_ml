[Verse 1]
Hope my mistakes don't make me less of a man
'Cause lately, it feel like them shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
It's hard to say it, so I write a song
But that ain't equal to me writing wrongs
I'm stuck between a rock and a heart place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on the best terms
But maybe we should love and we should learn

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight or be at war with you
But you gotta want the same things
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no, with you
But you gotta want the same things

[Post-Chorus]
So if you ever fall
You know that I'll be there
I know how to put my ego aside, yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But now I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfair, yeah
I know it's unfair, yeah

[Verse 2]
Do I got blessings or karma in my future?
Broke her heart, now that bitch listen to Future
At one point, I could say she was my shooter
Lately, I'm the one that's doing the shooting
Ruger fire the tooly, wasn't tryna use it
I told her I love her, she told me prove it
Summer 2011, it's like I looped it
Now I see her in you and that ain't even you
It's not stupid

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight or be at war (Don't wanna fight or be at war)
With you (With you), but you (But you)
Gotta want the same things (Want the same things)
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no, with you
But you gotta want the same things (Gotta want the same things)

[Post-Chorus]
So if you ever fall (So if you ever fall)
You know that I'll be there (You know that I'll be there)
I know how to put my ego aside
(I know how to put my ego aside), yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong (Correct me if I'm wrong)
You said you never wanna share (You never wanna share)
But now I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfair, yeah
I know it's unfair

[Outro]
I been chillin' in the studio
Tryin' to get home, but I gotta nice verse that I'm tryna get out
Every time I'm in the A
I don't know where nothing is in my own house
And that's kinda silly
Story of my life
