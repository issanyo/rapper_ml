[Intro]
Ahem
Oh, oh, oh, that's kinda gross, man, that's kinda gross

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Write my name, write my name on yo' flesh
Sneaky freak is cool but I'm more impressed if you obssesed with sex
No exception is a rule, with more exceptions than the rest
Rest an expression resemble death
Rest an expression resemble death
By them dollar [?] I ain't finished yet
I heard Jesus wet from the deepest depths of the internet
Too bad I ran out of kleenex masturbating on the day that her pussy bled
Tried to run the red, she like "No!" [No]
Respect, I was just testing the boundaries anyway
Anyway, what was I saying Super Saiyan, super say anything
Never expressin' myself on a level that lesser than God
Blessed with a gift for stretching the box
High as a bitch, strong as an ox
Look at me, look at my eyes
Look like I'm tired, look like I'm wired
Look could you tell I could look through the skies-ez
You could touch, you could taste, you could smell where my pride is

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Frolick through your flower garden, what a lovely day
Lay between your legs, oh, baby, what a lovely space
Hope you cleared your schedule, tell your man
You can't make it to-night, night
I don't need no help on how to do that shit right
Hope you did your yoga, baby, keep that shit tight
She says that she loves me 'cause
He ain't never brought out this side, side

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Learn to plunge in good she paradox pussy by the bundgy boo
She say she in love, she love her man, she matching up keys, she love her plans
She feelin' the buzz, she feelin' for bus, she tellin' the dog he never show up
He nothin' like you, he never could bust, never think of us, probably with his boo
And I be so filled up, so filled up with lust
I just gotta send a nudie to you and the who and I mean look at this look, at this, uh
I just gotta be valuable to somebody, honestly, look at me, look at me, uh
And the ass grabs and the neck bites and the chokeholds and the safe words and the, "Wait no, no, no, wait"
Like I, she was adamant, so much rambling, had to plug her up till she play right
Fuck her face off, fuck the day, night, it was way off, it was way right
And I can feel a thing, you was dead as the rest of them, just as led as the rest of them
And I know that she know I can hear what she saying, she staring and layin' and layin' to wrestle me
Yo' girl probably got that right now, stressin', wonderin' what the hells left of him
Did the world or the worst so it lies in the skirt with a pretty ass Merc get the best off him
Good intentions, filthy index fingers
The price of supressin' what's in ya'
Spread yo' mind so God can slide in it
Spread yo' ass and nothing else gets between us

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Frolick through your flower garden, what a lovely day
Lay between your legs, oh, baby, what a lovely space
Hope you cleared your schedule, tell your man
You can't make it to-night, night
I don't need no help on how to do that shit right
Hope you did your yoga, baby, keep that shit tight
She says that she loves me 'cause
He ain't never brought out this side, side

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Pull all your tricks out, show me what you 'bout
Okay, okay, okay, okay
When I swing this homerun, oh baby look out
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Pray while I'm in this, God is my witness
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay
Now excuse me, I gotta say my grace
Okay, here's what I can do, this is all the truth
When I'm done with you, I finish all my soup
Mmm, mmm, so damn good
I think that I just found my brand new drug
Okay, she say "what's your purpose?" I say "you are"
She say "you're lying", I say "dang, baby, [?]"
Try not to let the condom slip 'cause thats too raw
And I'm not tryna move you 'cross the country with that U-Haul
With all that shit that you are
