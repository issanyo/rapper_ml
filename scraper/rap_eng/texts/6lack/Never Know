[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, haaa
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, haha

[Verse 1]
I know a lot of people but I don't fuck with a lot
Got me standing here when I just wanna leave the spot
Thinking bout a whip and man I might just cop the drop
Just so they could think I'm friendly when I'm not
Arm out the window like yessir
Right good, working on my left bruh
Man I got my shit together then I stepped up
I got tired of niggas telling me I'm next up
Old label wasn't talking bout nothing
Meanwhile, I'm getting ready for a run
I ain't sitting, I ain't talking, I ain't hustling with you niggas
Fuck around and y'all gon' make me push a button on you niggas, ay
I got a baby on the way
I think about it every day
They think that paper gon' change me
I do this shit for my baby
I do this shit for my niggas
And we go way back just like crack in the muhfuckin 80's
This flow is crazy, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, nigga this flow is crazy
I don't fear no man or no object
Bullfighter, I've been working on my sidestep
I know preparation gets you through the process
Look at all the progress

[Hook]
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know, ay

[Verse 2]
I would never know
Worked on this shit till I was a pro
Ran through these streets, ran through these beats
Ran through these thoughts, ran through these hearts
I was in the dark till I caught a spark
Feel like I'm on fire, get too close, make a nigga die
They cannot be I, it's too hard, they could probably try
They could try, I'm on I-20 tryna get to 85
My girl mad but she don't want another guy
I wonder why?
Wait, no I don't
Work real hard and I get what I want
This is for them days we ain't eat
This is for them nights we ain't sleep
Going through beat after beat now
I could probably make 100 songs in my sleep
Yeah-yeah

[Hook]
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know, ay

[Outro]
I would never, I would never, I would never, I would never know
Yeah-yeah, I would never know
Oh-oh-oh, haaa
Oh-oh-oh
