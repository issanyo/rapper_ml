[Intro]
Girl, I got a lot that's goin' on
If I'm trippin', tell me what I'm doin' wrong
Grab the wheel, take the wheel
Grab the wheel, take the wheel, yeah

[Verse 1]
First one just couldn't touch me for shit
Last one just wasn't a good fit
She know that I'm here to replace her nigga
Tearin' her up somethin'
Usually, she don't, tonight she fuck some

[Pre-Chorus]
She say, "You a really special kinda nigga"
But show it, don't tell it, yeah
Hit me on my cellular
We can just vibe, just tell me when you're ready, yeah
Ayy, I'm lookin' for you
Roll another tube, blow it to the roof
Fuckin' in the coupe
Vroom, vroom, vroom
I said vroom, vroom

[Chorus]
I need you to grab the wheel
Tryna chill, but, you make it hard for me for real (woo)
I need you to grab the wheel, hell yeah
Grab the wheel (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you to put it in reverse
Risk it all if that's what it's worth
Grab the wheel, take the wheel
Grab the wheel, take the wheel, yeah

[Verse 2]
First one wasn't aggressive enough
Second one said all the wrong stuff
Don't think that I'm here to rebuild you, no
I came to just slide
You think too much
Stop thinkin', just drive

[Pre-Chorus]
She say, "You a really special kinda nigga"
But show it, don't tell it, yeah
Hit me on my cellular
We can just vibe, just tell me when you're ready, yeah
Ayy, I'm lookin' for you
Roll another tube, blow it to the roof
Fuckin' in the coupe
Vroom, vroom, vroom
I said vroom, vroom

[Chorus]
I need you to grab the wheel
Tryna chill, but, you make it hard for me for real
I need you to grab the wheel, hell yeah
Grab the wheel (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

[Outro]
I need you to make a decision because I can't
Do what's best for you and stop thinkin' 'bout what I think
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel like a NASCAR
Grab the wheel, but don't swerve it 'cause it's a fast car
If you want it it then you take it, don't want it, then let me know
Feelin' real compressed, I got shit that I wanna show
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel
Grab the wheel, yeah
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab the wheel
Grab the wheel
Grab the wheel
Grab the wheel
