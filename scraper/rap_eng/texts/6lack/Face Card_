Snippet:

[Pre-Hook: 6LACK]
Money callin', we all in
I don't do fake shit, that's borin'
It's all been in God's plan
I don't do lame shit, that's borin'

[Chorus: 6LACK]
It was all love, wasn't always that way
Face card on "Welcome back"
Face card on "How you been?"
Face card on "Everybody gotta pay, except for you"
I need like 21 cards, she ask, okay it's the crew

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
I need security and shit
I make investments to live
I need that ice on my wrist
But I just might, lil' bitch
I need security and shit
I make investments to live
I need that ice on my wrist
But I just might, lil' bitch
Just might, lil' bitch
This life I live
Runnin' late to the lab
Be there 'bout 6
Still plans, move slow
Just like my flow
Got a verse from 2 Chainz but ain't bought one
But just might, lil' ho

[Chorus: 6LACK]
It was all love, wasn't always that way
Face card on "Welcome back"
Face card on "How you been?"
Face card on "Everybody gotta pay, except for you"
I push a button and move, she ask, I'm like it's a rule
