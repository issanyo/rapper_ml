[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
I know exactly what this is
You don't wanna change, but you wanna change the way that I live
Instead of givin' pointers, I need you to look in the mirror
Tell me what makes you think we okay
Tell me what makes you think you're so great
Tell me why, is it some shit you won't say?
Tell me what makes you think you cool
Walk around like you got nothin' to lose

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I just need some time
I'll clear you out if I can't clear my mind
I think I just need some time
I'll clear you out if I can't clear my mind, yeah

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
I know exactly what you want from me
But I cannot give what I'm not gettin', that's a no for me
You take and you take
Then you expect a payback of love from me
I'm better without you
I'm only around you to make you feel better about you
I'ma have to get from around you

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
I know exactly what this is
You don't wanna change, but you wanna change the way that I live
Instead of givin' pointers, I need you to look in the mirror
Tell me what makes you think we okay
Tell me what makes you think you're so great
Tell me why it's still some shit you won't say
Tell me what makes you think you cool
Walk around like you got nothin' to lose

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I just need some time
I'll clear you out if I can't clear my mind
I think I just need some time
I'll clear you out if I can't clear my mind, yeah
