[Verse 1]
I can never worry 'bout the next man
Been too busy focused on the next plan
Only thing I check is balances and texts, man
And really baby, you the goat if I'm your ex-man
Nigga told me I was one-track minded
You got some nerve tweetin' from your mama house, ayy
You got some nerve tweetin' on your mama couch, ayy
You got some nerve, boy you better watch your mouth, ayy

[Chorus]
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah

[Verse 2]
How far would I get
If I was sittin' here thinkin' about all the shit
That niggas fix their mouth to say?
My baby gotta eat either way
So I'm takin' all the shit that I hear, split it in two
Advice I don't need, well maybe I do
And if it ain't true, then I cut it loose, ain't got shit to prove
Well, maybe to me, but never to you
And don't you ever hit my phone talkin' 'bout no competition
And this ain't bein' cocky, I just never wanna listen
'Cause I'm too busy focused on my own shit
I'm on that "Who the fuck came for the throne?" shit
I'm on that zone, zone, zone, zone, zone shit

[Pre-Chorus]
You got some nerve tweetin' from your mama house, ayy
You got some nerve tweetin' on your mama couch, ayy
You got some nerve, boy you better watch your mouth, ayy

[Chorus]
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now if I had a dollar every time someone outside of my shoes
Told me how to step in mine, I'd be jumpin' in a pile
You should take some of that energy, apply it to yourself
Get some accolades under your belt, yeah
You got some nerve tweetin' from your mama house, ayy
She taught you better, you should really watch your mouth, ayy
You're watchin' me when you should really watch your spouse, ayy
Yeah she been lookin' for a new way out, ayy

[Chorus]
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You need to check yourself, yeah

[Outro]
Zone, zone shit
Tweetin' from your mama house, ayy, ayy
