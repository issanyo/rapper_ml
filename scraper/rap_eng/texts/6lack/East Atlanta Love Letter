[Intro: Future]
Freebandz
6LACK, yeah

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Curiosity been at an all-time high in the tree tops
I remix your life like cut cocaine and it's a re-rock
Ain't been wanting much lately, no, 'cause you're my detox
Repeat, run it back, one more time, 'til we hit the, sweet spot

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK & Future]
Bet if we make love like we always knew each other (yeah)
You'd be searching far and wide but you wouldn't want another
Does it make you happy? If so, that's what I'm on
I'll be at it till your troubles are gone

[Chorus: 6LACK & Future]
It's an East Atlanta Love Letter
Who gon' love better?
Nobody because I say so
And my words hit like a Draco (Draco)
Oh, oh
It's an East Atlanta Love Letter
Who gon' love better?
Nobody because I say so
And my words hit like a Draco

[Break: Future]
Curi-osi-ty

[Verse 2: Future]
Curiosity been at an all-time high in the tree tops (oh yeah, tree tops)
I remix your love like cut cocaine it's re-rock (mix your love, it's a reroute)
Ain't been wanting much lately, no, 'cause you my detox (no, 'cause you my detox, ayy)
If we, run it back, one more time, 'til we hit the, sweet spot

[Pre-Chorus: Future & 6LACK]
But if we make love like we always knew each other (but if we made love like we always knew each other)
You would be searching far and wide but you wouldn't want another (you wouldn't want another)
Does he make you happy? (Does he make you happy)

And my words hit like a Draco (brrrp)

[Verse 3: Future & 6LACK]
Coming from the bottom of the mud (concrete)
Concrete filled up with blood
Extended clip, no pea coat
Big pimp, damn, that hoe
Piss po' head to toe (yeah, yeah)
Forty-four, let it go (let it go)
Patek, Patek, icy cold (let it go)
Pink diamonds, what's up
This is a zone six stick up
Come through, everything get hit up

[Outro: Future & 6LACK]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who gon' love better?
Who gon' love better? Nobody
Because I say so, and my words hit
East side
