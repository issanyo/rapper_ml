[Verse 1]
I'ma write you my best song
It’s gon' take me all night long
I was up late by myself
I ain't never need no help
I will love you when you're old
And you lose the words you spoke
Time will never wait on us
But it never can age our love
Aw, yeah

[Chorus]
Say you'll always be my greatest fan
Sing your favorite words just like a band
Only if you'll love me like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man
Down to walk the walk until the end
The prize, you find a lover and a friend
Baby, I'ma love you like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man

[Post-Chorus]
All that I
All that I wanna do
Is put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on the line

[Verse 2]
Hoping we go out at the same time
'Cause life without my love is a slant rhyme
That mean it works out but it ain't quite
What it 'posed to be that ain't all right
I'm just thankful that I could find you
Seems like I was always behind you
I ain't worried 'bout no Alzheimer's
No, I don't need no fuckin' reminder
Aw, yeah

[Chorus]
Say you'll always be my greatest fan
Sing your favorite words just like a band
Only if you'll love me like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man
Down to walk the walk until the end
The prize, you find a lover and a friend
Baby, let me love you like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man

[Bridge]
All that I
All that I wanna do
Is put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on the line
(Put it on, aw, man)
All that I (all that I)
All that I wanna do is
Is put it on, put it on (put it on), put it on, (put it on) put it on the line
Put it on the line

[Outro]
People go through life not knowing
Not knowing what love is
People go through life not showing
Not showing what love is
I mean
It's like you think you know, but you don’t really know
Then you find out, woah
You gotta learn things slow
But one thing I know
One thing I know
You, you got
You got all my love
