[Intro: Loud4Life]
Hollywood on the track like
Fufu, yeah, nigga, fufu
I'm a genius

[Chorus: Loud4Life]
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
All the bitches goin' cuckoo
Roll up a blunt like two flutes
Got goons on go, they might shoot you
Ain't on my team boy, who you?
Tattoo, jewels, and horseshoes
Y'all thinkin' lame, we three cool
Everythin' legit, you fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
Everythin' legit, you fufu

[Verse 1: Loud4Life]
Pull to the club, now the hoes on the watch
House on my chain and your hoe on my cock
If you got a problem, nigga, tell it to the Glock
All you hear is shots, nigga, yah, yah, yah

[Bridge: Loud4Life]
Fufu, the fuck would you do?
I say my niggas too cool, too cool, igloo
Yeah, yeah, real nigga all day and tomorrow, hoe
I don't wanna for the keeps, I'm tryna ball, bro

[Chorus: Loud4Life]
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
All the bitches goin' cuckoo
Roll up a blunt like two flutes
Got goons on go, they might shoot you
Ain't on my team boy, who you?
Tattoo, jewels, and horseshoes
Y'all thinkin' lame, we three cool
Everythin' legit, you fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
Everythin' legit, you fufu

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Fly that booty in a big whip
You don't wanna play, I got a big clip
Any big makin', hit a big flip
Big cup of drank, take a big sip
Bands on 6, I'm a big dog
I'll have my young niggas sic y'all
I took a nigga bitch, now he pissed off
I got the block jumpin' like Kris Kross
I got some records, that way
I'm on custom, the bat way
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I got a plug named Woah
I got the stick, pogo
Your bitch, she tatted the logo
I run up a check, like Flo-Jo
I run through a bag of that dojo
Pocket rocket and it's ready
Diamonds on me and it's heavy
You fufu niggas cannot catch me
I push the Bentley like a Chevy
My hittas with me, shit be deadly
Remember baggin' up the celly
Yeah, my fast car excellent
Racks bustin' out my True Religions

[Chorus: Loud4Life]
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
All the bitches goin' cuckoo
Roll up a blunt like two flutes
Got goons on go, they might shoot you
Ain't on my team boy, who you?
Tattoo, jewels, and horseshoes
Y'all thinkin' lame, we three cool
Everythin' legit, you fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Fufu, fufu, fufu, fufu
Racks in my jeans on beaucoup
Everythin' legit, you fufu
