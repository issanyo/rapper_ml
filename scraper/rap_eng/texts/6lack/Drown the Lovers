[Verse 1: 6LACK]
So as I sit here painting pictures with my words
Your ex lover trying to talk but he's submerged
What's the purpose? Tell him it's absurd
You gonna feel that pressure till there's water in your vessels
Once that water pumps they won't be able to jump
Once your ex is dumped he won't be able to stunt
Love is like a pool, tell the others they can drown in it too
But I got better plans for us, I'm down for drowning in you
I got the whole world here in my hands
And you can have it all on demand
Tell me everything you're feeling, where are we
I feel like we're deep under the sea
Forget about it, stop your pouting
Watch you thrash while you float
Then you laugh from a boat
Drop a heart like an anchor on the coast

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
And we can drown all the lovers that have gone before
Let's light them by the wrist
Their fingerprints will burn
I should drown all the lovers that couldn't love you more
Won't surface to exist
Love like we never hurt

[Post-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
Let them drown (oh yeah)
Let them drown (deep under the sea)
Let them drown

[Verse 2: Gerard O'Connell & 6LACK]
Preservation
Set fire to the basement
That's where you keep the truth
Let's replace them
Forget what they have taken
Forget we ever lose (oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell]
And we'll lose their grip in waters dark
And all will sink
There'll be no start to finish this
There'll be no start to finish this

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
And we can drown all the lovers that have gone before
Let's light them by the wrist
Their fingerprints will burn
I should drown all the lovers that couldn't love you more
Won't surface to exist
Love like we never hurt

[Bridge: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
Make it so they never surface (oh yeah), they're gone
Love me like they never hurt us, no one
Make it so they never surface (oh yeah), they're gone
Love me like they never hurt us, no one

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
And we can drown all the lovers that have gone before
Let's light them by the wrist
Their fingerprints will burn
I should drown all the lovers that couldn't love you more
Won't surface to exist
Love like we never hurt

[Post-Chorus: Gerard O'Connell, Katie Taylor & 6LACK]
Let them drown (oh yeah)
Let them drown (deep under the sea)
Let them drown
