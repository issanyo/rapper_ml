[Verse 1]
Are you who I be in this weekend
If so, let's get lost in the deep end
Exhale my name, then you absorb my soul every time that you breathe in
Take off that dress, lay your heart on my chest
I think I wanna keep it
You fall asleep, no worries, I be right here when you finish dreaming
I see something in you, I know that it's crazy 'cause girl I just met you
But we joining forces 'cause that would be gorgeous
No girl, I won't let up
I just rolled the dice so no more thinkin' twice
Destiny she won't fail us
If you feel what I feel can you just keep it real
Baby, it ain't no pressure

[Hook]
No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart
I know you looking for real love
I got my hand on my Glock, posted on the block
I might just let off a shot, at anyone tryin' to kill love

[Verse 2]
If we do this right, we'll be Bonnie and Clyde for the rest of our lives
Hit up a bank, then hide out in the woods for the rest of the night
Make love on the cash that we took from the vault just a while ago
Said you can't describe this new feeling, you feeling, well I'll move slow
I saw something in you that you didn't see, I made you a believer
I taught you the rules, now you good at the game
Baby, I was your teacher
Yeah, you made me fall like the Autumn, but chin up 'cause I'll never leave ya
I no longer front, girl, you're more than a want
Now I know that I need ya

[Hook]
No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart
I know you looking for real love
I got my hand on my Glock, posted on the block
I might just let off a shot, at anyone tryin' to kill love

No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart
I know you looking for real love
I got my hand on my Glock, posted on the block
I might just let off a... kill love
Love...
