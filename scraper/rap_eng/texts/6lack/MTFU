[Intro]
Babe, babe, babe, babe

[Hook]
Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin
I know I more than fucked up
Now I feel stupid
Why would I do this

[Verse 1]
She ain't know no better but I did
Poor decision making for the kid
And all because you left us for a second
Now I’m tryna figure out the lesson
Of all the people I fucked up on you
What the fuck was I supposed to do
This shit is sticky
Its tricky
And kinda hard to explain
Wanna refrain but being human is strange
Apologizing in advance for the pain

[Hook]
Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin
I know I more than fucked up
Now I feel stupid
Why would I do this

[Verse 2]
Trying to tell you what it is
She came to the crib
Whispered in my ear some shit I wanna hear
Then told me y'all ain't cool
Were finished, y'all were through
So then I took her word, ain't run that shit by you
I made myself believe everything was okay
Meanwhile she at your house
She smiling in your face
She smiling in your face
But you don’t even know
So I can’t even say
