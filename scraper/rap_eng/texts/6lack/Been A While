[Verse 1]
Cannot do the surface level shit
You know I gets deeper
Deeper than your favorite, mmm
Yeah, don't be out here screaming, "Gang, gang, gang"
If you ain’t gang, gang
Lookin' silly out here baby
Why you twisting up your fingers, mmm
You wanna solidify your spot now
'Cause I’m hot now
You don't get the picture
Can't tell that it's cropped now
Got this shit on lockdown
I'm as sick as they come, wasn't the one
Now I'm in front, roll up the blunt
Listenin' to DRAM, ain’t no tellin’ what I'm finna be on (Be on)
Ain’t a kickstand, not the one to lean on

[Chorus]
It's been a while since I last seen you
Might want you, but I find peace knowin' I don't need ya
It’s been a while since I last seen you
Might want you, but I find peace knowin' I don't need ya

[Verse 2]
You know he don't write like this
Think nice like this, can't pipe like this
Girl, we know I gets deeper, mmm
You know I could see the shine in your eyes
I remember you was blind with your eyes
Funny how your vision finally got cleaned up, mmm
So you want to solidify a spot now, not now
Silly, silly, silly, you look at me as a prop now
Ever since "Never Know," she wanna know if I really got the drop now
Did you talk this much back in the day?
Well maybe you changed, maybe these games
Ain't really games, maybe you serious
Maybe I'm trippin', am I delirious?
'Cause it's been a while since I last seen you, you know
A lot is different, I'm finally living

[Chorus]
It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you, but I find peace knowin' I don't need ya
It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you, but I find peace knowin' I don't need ya
