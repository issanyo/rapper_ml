[Verse]
Watch your mouth when you lettin' shit slide
Don't you know I got way too much pride?
Sneak dissin' way on the other side
I turn your fucking wave to a tide
I'm so fucking tired, somehow I still find the time
To care a little more about my rhymes
To care a little more about my peers
To think a little less about my fears
To care a little more about your ears
I give a piece of me to everybody I meet
Not because they want it, it's because it's prolly a need
Claim they woke but they probably asleep, in a cage
Thinking if they make a mill they be free like Meek, nah
I turned a nightmare right into a dream, yeah
I keep my sanity, 'cause I ain't on the scene, yeah
I know I gotta be a rock like Dwayne
So, I'm tryna be a rock like Dwayne, Carter Rebirth
Put that line in reverse, add a little reverb, yeah
We work, so my niggas ain't gotta be on T-Shirts
Watch me get my hands dirty with the rework
Damn, do I even have the fans for this shit?
To be rapping like these people understanding this shit
It's demanding and shit, but I stand for these kids
Like they stan for the kid, understand, how we clear
Crack a beer when I'm feelin' pissed, hmm, yeah
But I ain’t got nobody hand up my back, you ventriloquist
Ever since my songs went platinum like Sisqó
Life done found a filter like VSCO, ay
But it's okay, 'cause
If you down and you need a lil' help, it's a way
If you hatin' and you feelin' insecure, Issa Rae
I'm somewhere between humble and hell nah
These niggas drop their second album then fell off
My nonchalant flow will never end right
It be at they necks if it's in sight
Squeezing until they crack a windpipe
Loosen the grip, have a lil' remorse
You dial 9-1-1 I pull up in a Porsche
Word is I'm carrying the torch and I ain't wanna share
So beware if you reach you get scorched
Ever since I jumped off the porch
I knew that I would grow to be the boy
The boy then grew to be the man
Learned how to kill a hook, Peter Pan
I'm tryna make the end stand out
But I'm so fucking outstanding
I'm so fucking outlandish and a opp can't win
Man's not hot
I been on ten, landslide wins, yeah
