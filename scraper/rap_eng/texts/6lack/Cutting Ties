[Intro]
Runnin' through my weed again, yeah
Runnin' through my weed again, yeah
Runnin' through my weed
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well

[Verse 1]
One, two, been thinking on it hard this morning
Three, four, it's hard to focus when a nigga zoning
I been tryna balance all this on my plate
I ain't tryna be lying to your face
You can do better than I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Something I need to share before you rest here
I know that you gave your best here
But I can't figure out what's next here

[Pre-Chorus]
I pray to God I don't have to pay for not knowing
This world is new to me, I do not know it
My pride never wanted you to know this
Sometimes I just wanna be alone and

[Chorus]
Either way I gotta go, woah, oh
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you know I'm moving through this thang at the speed of light
Rolling on the street like it’s gon' be what you want it to be like
Won’t lie, you been on my brain right, charge it to the game right
Girl, we know that nothing is the same, right

[Verse 2]
Five, six, times that I shoulda had that convo, yeah
Seven, eight, could you be gone by tomorrow?
Hydroplaning tryna pump my brakes
I don't wanna make it look like I ran away
You could do better than I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Something you need to know, you gotta let go
You throwing a fit and that's old
Don't be stepping on my Prestos

[Pre-Chorus]
I pray to God I don't have to pay for not knowing
This world is new to me, I do not know it
My pride never wanted you to know this
Sometimes I wanna be alone and

[Chorus]
Either way I gotta go, woah, oh, yeah
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh, no
Either way I gotta go, woah, oh
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh

[Outro]
One, two, been thinking on it hard this morning
Three, four, it's hard to focus when a nigga zoning
Five, six, times that I shoulda had that convo, yeah
Seven, eight, could you be gone by tomorrow?
