[Intro]
Umm-umm-ummm

[Verse 1]
You still got a lot to learn
I ain't saying I'm the best
I'm saying that I got a lot to work with ya
Fuck talking, we capped enough
I ain't trying to make it look like I just wanna fuck
I'm just trying to show this ain't no temporary love
I think you need to let me learn ya something
How you gonna get better with a nigga who don’t even measure up
Shame shame shame
You’ve been fucking regulars
I think ya need to let me learn ya something
No need to tell you not to sleep
I let my hands speak
Now learn a couple things about me

[Chorus]
Girl, when you go, don’t try to act like your last one hit it the same way
Girl, when you go, don’t try to act like your last one did ya the same way
Your last one did ya the same way
Your last one hit it the same way, girl

[Verse 2]
We still got a lot to do
If you need a quick fix for your day
I be on the way
Got a couple things that I gots to prove
You lack and it hurts to know
I tell you cause I'm really trying to help ya
But you take it personal
I think I really need to learn you something
Yeah, I met you in the past life
I know everything
Oh, you’re that type
Bad, bad girl
Won’t you act right?
I need to learn you something, yea
Don’t gotta ask
I can see
I let my hands speak
Just learn a couple things about me

[Chorus]
Girl, when you go, don’t try to act like your last one hit it the same way
Girl, when you go, don’t try to act like your last one did ya the same way
Your last one did ya the same way
Your last one hit it the same way
Girl
