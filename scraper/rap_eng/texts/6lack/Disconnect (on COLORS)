[Distorted intro]
You think I don't
You think I don't know when to call it quits
You think I don't know when to call it quits
You think I don't know when to call it quits
You think I don't
You think I don't

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
You think I don't know when to call it quits
How could I not know after all this here?
I spent so much time tryna find a signal, but
It's safe to say it's no good
A nigga need to roll

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
No, I don't wanna piss you off
No, I ain't tryna make you yell
Now why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
No, I don't wanna piss you off
I ain't tryna make you yell
Now why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I'm tryna work it out, yeah
But we got a disconnect
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect, yeah, eh

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Love is not looking over shoulders
Love is you should trust what I told you
Lately it's like you been speaking fantasy and I'm speaking reality
'Cause we got problems we ain't getting over
I think we breaking up
And not just on some boyfriend-girlfriend shit
I think we had enough
Like, I can't hear you
I'm falling out of love

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect, yeah, eh

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Love is not struggling to tell you "I love you"
Or you saying music's above you
I do this shit here 'cause I need
I need you, but you couldn't see, so
I'm out here, listening to Monster
Heartbreak sponsor, smoking on the ganja, yeah
No, I don't have no time left to care, spare, or share

[Bridge: 6LACK]
You done made Cupid aim away
A bow and arrow could take the pain away
You done made Cupid aim away
A bow and arrow could take the pain away

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
But I don't wanna piss you off
I ain't tryna make you yell
Girl, why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
No, I don't wanna piss you off
I ain't tryna make you yell
Why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?

[Outro: 6LACK]
I'm tryna work it out
