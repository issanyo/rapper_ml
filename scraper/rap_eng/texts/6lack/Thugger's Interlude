[Intro]
Going under

[Verse]
Going under
Tryna keep myself from going under
I've been listening to Young Thugger
When it's good, it's good
But the question is, are you down to fuck with the other side? (No cap, no rap cap)
Lately I been bumping trap music
Don't wanna listen if I canâ€™t dab to it
'Cause all that other shit makes me think about all the things I don't wanna think about
But I'm a hypocrite, 'cause here I am with another slow song
I'm a hypocrite, singing like a nigga doing no wrong
Ever since I got me a check, I got a check
Them digits really have them bitches coming for your neck (for your neck)
