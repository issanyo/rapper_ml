[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Born in the jungle, it's the lion's den
What the hell you gon' do when it's your time to spend
I'm thinkin' to myself "should I take that chance?"
Do I not? The streets callin' and it's in my hands
You either runnin' from the cops or you runnin' the block
Do the devil's work and hope you don't get shot
Yeah I'm still young but all work no play
Student of the game, one day sensei
Now I do anything for my fam
Even if that means I gotta push a couple grams
To get a couple grand
Momma told me it won't be easy
Runnin' through these streets in a flash, can't see me
I'd do anything for my fam
I might have to do some shit that you don't understand
To get a couple grand
Momma told me it won't be easy

[Hook]
So I bow my head and pray
So I bow my head and pray
Don't let 'em get in my way, ay
Don't let 'em get in my way

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Proceed with caution, the city don't sleep
Just know that when you fam everybody gon' eat
My homie from the corner just passed last week
Said he would live forever when I asked last week
It's crazy I wanna be patient but
Time is tickin' I cannot waste it love
Money, power, respect, until I am the best
King of all things, it is I in the flesh

[Hook]
So I bow my head and pray
So I bow my head and pray
Don't let 'em get in my way, ay
Don't let 'em get in my way

[Hook]
So I bow my head and pray
So I bow my head and pray
Don't let 'em get in my way, ay
Don't let 'em get in my way

[Bridge: 6LACK]
Get it how I live
Follow what I feel
And I know I can use some change
But sometimes to make it out you gotta do some things
Get it how I live
Follow what I feel
And I know I can use some change
But sometimes to make it out you gotta do some things

[Hook]
So I bow my head and pray
So I bow my head and pray
Don't let 'em get in my way, ay
Don't let 'em get in my way

[Hook]
So I bow my head and pray
So I bow my head and pray
Don't let 'em get in my way, ay
Don't let 'em get in my way
