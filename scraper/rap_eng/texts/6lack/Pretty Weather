[Pre-Hook: Twelve'Len]
You know, I know, it's more to us
I know, you know, it's more, it's more

[Hook: 6LACK]
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather

(5-4-3-2)

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
I'm feelin' lucky today
I hope you're here for the stay
Picnic, hella games
Nothing's better to me
Ya lookin' like a sunray
Wit' all that light in my face

[Pre-Hook: Twelve'Len]
You know, I know, it's more to us
I know, you know, it's more, it's more

[Hook: 6LACK]
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather

[Verse 2: Twelve'Len]
Lay my lips on you from head to toe
Baby bite those lips, roll those eyes
I'ma make ya blow
If you love me then let everybody know it
Baby go on out & show it
Make me wanna pack you into my knapsack
Start the car & floor it

[Pre-Hook: Twelve'Len]
You know, I know, it's more to us
I know, you know, it's more, it's more

[Hook: 6LACK]
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather
It don't get no better
Than you & pretty weather
