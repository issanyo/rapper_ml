[Intro]
Free, free, free

[Verse 1]
I ain't one for no games, fuck is you saying
Don't you start to act strange, stick to the plan
A lot of shit that you already know the answers to
I ain't really understanding you
It's a lot on my mind that I really wanna say to you
I don't wanna play with you
Ain't no scrub so don't try, yeah
Talk my shit then hit it right, yeah
You ain't going nowhere, yeah
Fronting like you don't care, yeah

[Hook]
You got that shit that make me come back
But this time I think I'm good where I'm at
You using sex to try to distract
Me from the fact you don't deserve to be where you at

[Verse 2]
It's sad to say I had to leave my girl back home
She tripping, I don't think that I could love her no more
She popping up at parties tryna look the other way
Girl you can't ignore me if your friends say "Hey"
You know we too old for the games
Fuck me good, keep a nigga sane
Treat me right, make me wanna stay
This could be us but it ain't
I know that you gon' hate when I'm free, yeah
Cause I got just what you need, yeah
This November 18th, yeah
Just in time for the weekend

[Bridge]
You know we too old for the games
Fuck me good and keep a nigga sane
Treat me right and make me wanna stay
Don't make me have to find my own way
You know we too old for the games
Fuck me good and keep a nigga sane
Treat me right and make me wanna stay
Don't make me have to find my own way

[Outro]
Listen ma, I give you all I've got give me
All of it, a newfound confidence in myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen ma, I give you all of me just give me
All of it, newfound confidence in myself
