[Verse 1: Shawn K]
To the south trying to pave me
Do I even really feel the need to keep going?
Why is that you can pick your own placement
Where the leaves maintained and the whole city glowing?
Mad because I'm trapped in the world I perceived as real
When actually we all just flowing
And you ain't trying to make a change
You stuck in lanes that cultivate
My niggas still ain't growing
So tell me why you here?
If you ain't trying to make the best of my time, please disappear
Cause I ain't got time for the bullshit, nigga
Bullpen, I've been searching for the atmosphere
But I'm locked in the pinnacle
When I don't see a drop, then a miracle
Put it in, it all works
But until then, I'mma pretend that I'm walking with the wind
And I do not see an end first

[Pre-hook: 6LACK & Shawn K]
I look around and I see the clones (I see the clones)
And they got me wondering when I go home (When I go home)
So I spread my wings and look to the sky (Look to the sky)
They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die

[Hook: Shawn K & 6LACK]
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't let it be your demise
I see that ready to die, I see that ready to die
(They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die)
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't let it be your demise
I see that ready to die, I see that ready to die
(They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Ayy, running, aim at the brain
Made that boy forget what he think
Pop pop, if I ever got shot, it's okay
Cause I got a couple lines on the bank
Do you really care about the shit they feeding you?
You looking for inspiration
You should probably believe enough
Cause everything they talking is all good
Until they kill your brother, then it's all hood
Will you take a phone? Nigga I would
And light the world up like firewood
As I look around, there's so many things I wanna take away
But that ain't my place, so I stay in mine
I'mma see y'all when it's crunch time

[Pre-hook: 6LACK & Shawn K]
I look around and I see the clones (I see the clones)
And they got me wondering when I go home (When I go home)
So I spread my wings and look to the sky (Look to the sky)
They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die

[Hook: Shawn K & 6LACK]
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't let it be your demise
I see that ready to die, I see that ready to die
(They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die)
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't let it be your demise
I see that ready to die, I see that ready to die
(They ain't ready to fight, they ready to die)
