Wrong Answer

[Chorus]
Tell me who you love, if the first answer ain't you
Then ooo, that's the wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, yea, yea, yea, yea
Tell me who you love, if the first answer ain't you
Then ooo, that's the wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer
I said tell me who you love, if the first answer ain't you
Then ooo, that's the wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer

[Verse 1]
I said tell me what your looking for
'Cause if it's love baby, then your doing it wrong, yea, yea
Say you ain't gotta search for love, no
Tryna help you out, that's why I wrote the song, yea, yea
Before you get the searching, do you love yourself, before you love somebody else
You gotta multiply your wealth
And I ain't talking money, I'm talking 'bout your soul
Make sure that's made of gold, and everything else can go-o
Get that [?] off ya, get them groupies off ya
All the distractions off ya, self-love now were talking
Cause if you don't love you, how you gon' love them
If you need some pill, this is where you begin

[Chorus]
I said tell me who you love, if the first answer ain't you
Then ooo, that's the wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer
I said tell me who you love, if the first answer ain't you
Then ooo, that's the wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer, wrong answer

[Verse 2]
I say you out here tryna love everybody but yourself
You looking for a reef when the best is on the shelf
I say you out here tryna love everybody but yourself
You looking for a reef when the best is on the shelf
Tell me one thing, and imma leave you alone
When you need some help, do you call yourself or call Tyrone
Then tell me one thing, and imma leave you to
When you need some help, do you call yourself or call your boo
Ain't nothing wit' that, but imma tell you what's wrong with you
You
Gotta prioritize, true
Ain't nothing wit' that, but imma tell you what's wrong with you
You gotta prioritize, true

Fade To Kuro


[Bridge]
Fade to Kuro, Fade to Kuro
Fade to Kuro, yea, Fade to Kuro
Fade to Kuro, Fade to Kuro
Through your trials and tribulations, Your trials and tribula-, baby
Through your trials and tribulations-ons

[Verse 3]
Everything happen for a reason
Some people come for a lifetime, and some for a season
Everything happen for a cause, ya, I know it gets hard
But we can beat the odds
I said, I know I just met, but I won't forget you
Never neglect you, always respect you
I know you just met me, don't you forget me, ever neglect me
Always respect me

[Outro]
Fade to Kuro, Fade to Kuro
Fade to Kuro, Fade to Kuro
Fade to Kuro, Fade to Kuro, yea
