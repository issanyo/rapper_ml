[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Hands 'round my neck
You know I got a lot left
Can't have nobody else getting away
You should get your confirmation today
Usually I don't do no flying out
But I been going through some things on the road yeah
Thinking 'bout that old thing
We still haven't even been to each other's house
But baby that could wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
Though I might fuck up your life

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Take one breath, take two (two)
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
I shoulda copped the one way
Girl, I know you wanna stay, stay, stay

[Bridge: 6LACK]
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Don't feel no way (no way, no way)
'Less it's from foreplay (foreplay)
You know you wetter than most
Brought you in on first class, that's better than most
Now usually, I don't do no flying out
But to keep it G, it's been a long week and I'm feeling lonely
We still haven't even fucked on each other's couch
Maybe that should wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
But I will fuck up your life

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Take one step, take two (two)
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
Shoulda copped the one way
And I know you wanna stay, stay, stay

[Bridge: 6LACK]
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Just getting off stage now (when will you be here?)
Cause FaceTime ain't enough face time
Tell your boss you ain't working tomorrow
And ask 'em why they got my girl working so hard
Now, you gon' make me use up all my miles
Famous niggas get so lonely
And I know you gon' come and put it on me
And I can't wait to put this in your mouth
I should probably go and take care of mine-uh
Text me when you land in South Carolina
Tell the Uber she can take one left, take two
Oh, I don't really know what I'ma do when I see you
I don't really have not much to say
That's why I got the one way
That shit is expensive babe
So I had to put you on the plane for this

[Outro: T-Pain]
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time (this time)
Something feel different this time (this time, this time)
