[Chorus]
I don't wanna know where you from
I just wanna know where you at
'Cause it ain't where you from
You think that then you  dumb, you dumb
It ain't where you from it's where you, at

[Verse 1]
One time for the people just like me
Two time for them rappers tryna bite me
Three times for the people who don't know 'bout 6LACK
Four times for them haters tryna hold me back
I put my heart all in this game
My book so deep off in this thing
You can see that music all in my veins
Same since day one, ain't a thing changed

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know where you from
I just wanna know where you at
'Cause it ain't where you from
You think that then you  dumb, you dumb
It ain't where you from it's where you, at

[Verse 2]
Open your mind, open your mind
Stop wasting your time, all of the time
Making excuses all of 'em lies
Now you wanna cry
All on the floor, and you don't know why
But I'll tell you why
Cause you rather die
When you survive, I say

[Bridge]
Can't hold me back
But I told them that
It ain't where you from
I said it's where you at
It ain't where you from
I said it's where you at
I said it's where you at
I said it's where you at

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know where you from
I just wanna know where you at
'Cause it ain't where you from
You think that then you  dumb, you dumb
It ain't where you from it's where you, at

[Outro]
I don't wanna know, I-I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know, know, know
I don;t wanna know where you, you, you, you, you
I don't wanna know where you from
