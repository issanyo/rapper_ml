Hook:
People gon’ love what they don’t need, used to ride through the city with the money green, people really don’t love the old me, stop walkin round cuttin down the big o’ trees
Verse 1:
- [ ] When I tell you this it’s what I really mean, when you see me coming through don’t drink no lean, better stop tripping cause I got the jeans, say you better stop tripping and stop drinking lean
- [ ] Listen to me now, I know you like my sound, when I come around please don’t try to pull a bounce, when my raps are slick you see it’s fast and round, just stop that cause you see the big o’ town
- [ ] When you see me coming, you wanna laugh, but that’s a really bad idea, cut that in half

Verse 2:
- [ ] Say, it’s night time so it’s time to shine, and when I hit the billboards I’ll make it mine, I try so hard to get my rhymes, but when it’s rapping I don’t wanna get to behind
- [ ] Please just listen and just get in line, Ive been through this maybe bout 3 times 5, late at night ima show you drive, and when I come around you gon see the real rhyme
- [ ] Be cautious were you play there’s darkness in the hay
