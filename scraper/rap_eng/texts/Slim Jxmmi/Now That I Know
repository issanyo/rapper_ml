[Intro]
Don't do
EarDrummers
Don't do
(Mike WILL Made It)

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit tellin' the world that I deal with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I don't know what it is about these bitches
Maybe it's me listenin' to the radio
Kickin' it with this good dope
That I chose to roll with these bad hoes
And I can't complain
I came up, came up on y'all hoes and I'm not ashamed

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit tellin' the world that I deal with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Two middle fingers
It ain't nothin' to forget you
I blocked your number, can't call my phone
And I'm with some other bitches
She a player like me
Try to leave a nigga on E
Had to keep trippin', OD
Bounce back to the old me
I shoulda listened to the homies
Hit it then quit it then went about my fuckin' business
But I was fuckin' with lil momma, that was my decision
And I don't really listen to nobody else opinion
You tell your girls you done with me
But I know you fuck with me
Cause these other niggas inconsistent
And these other niggas ain't Jxmmi

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit telling them hoes that I chill with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
(Haha, Swae Lee)
I can't love you
I can't love you
