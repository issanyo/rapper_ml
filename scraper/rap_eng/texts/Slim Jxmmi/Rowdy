[Verse 1: BoBo Swae]
Wetter than a fountain
She keep climbin' up my mountain
I keep countin' all these hunnids
She keep lookin', I won't pass 'em
All these bottles comin'
And they go off
I might fuck around
And take your hoe
I see shawty, I'm just tryna get rowdy
Come into your crib, this a fuckin' mansion party
Get up out them panties, why you playin' all them games?
I fucked your best friend but I ain't sayin' no names
Okay, the game's changed, girl, the shoes not the same
She say she wanna fuck me, I say, "First you give me brain"
Let's get rowdy in the bed
Let's get rowdy, give me head

[Chorus: BoBo Swae]
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (yeah)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Say he got some money but I highly fuckin' doubt it
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I damn near just started a riot (huh)
Had them bottles comin' to me all night
I scratchin' ma with bitches on sight
I'm mixin' Gucci with the Off White
Iced grill gave me frostbite
Feel like I hit the lottery twice
Every single day, I gotta be high
Geeked up in the function
Niggas think they gettin' money
'Til they see you pull up in a Lamborghini
It was nice to meet me
Million dollar nigga, every time you see me
I'm a player, ballin' every season
On a pill, talkin' like a deacon
On the drank, hangin' off the ceilin'
I'm the boss and these bitches agreein'
Grab a cup and get throwed in the party
Uncle Jxmmi be goin' retarded
Honestly, I was made for this shit
Do it so well she can pay for this shit
Look at my ears and my neck and my wrist
All this ice look ridiculous
Money talk so you know what it is
We gettin' rowdy in this bitch

[Chorus: BoBo Swae]
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (yeah)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Say he got some money but I highly fuckin' doubt it
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
All these people lookin' but they still ain't lookin' past me
I mean, yeah, I'm tryna party but I still ain't doin' acid
20 bitches smokin' on sativas
Me, my niggas mobbin' like some criminals
Shorty got freaky and she red, hey
I'm the shit, you heard what I said, yeah
I need fuckin' hundreds stacked on hundreds like my bed stacks
I be jumpin' in the crowd like I'm jumpin' off the ledge
We the rowdiest up in the buildin', give us credit
If they tryna mooch off me, you know that I won't let 'em
Let's get rowdy in the cut
Don't worry 'bout what's in my cup

[Chorus: BoBo Swae]
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (yeah)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Let's get rowdy if you 'bout it (hey)
Say he got some money but I highly fuckin' doubt it
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Le-le-let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
Let's get this shit rowdy (yeah)
Let's get this shit rowdy
