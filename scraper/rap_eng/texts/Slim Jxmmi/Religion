[Intro: Slim Jxmmi]
Trail Mix!

[Hook x2: Slim Jxmmi]
When I was broke I was on a mission
When I was broke I was on a mission
Young nigga broke and I gotta get it,,
I'm on a grind like it's my religion
I just want to see the big figures
Don't you see the  bigger picture?
I just want to see the big figures
I wanna get it with my niggas

[Verse 1: Riff 3X]
I want to get it with the niggas came up with me from the day one
I wanna make sure my Mama can always fall back on her son
I wanna make sure ma daddy ain’t gonna struggle no more I got you pops
I don’t want to hustle no more man
Ain’t no more standing on block’s
I told my nigga they will gone run up a chick
Ain’t no more stress
I got on my knees to thank the lord for sending my all of these blessings
Ain’t no more hangin' on corners
Ain’t no more hangin' on corners
Ain’t no more slangin' the rocks
Dodging the [?] on the corner
I came from walking on green
To flying in Beverly Hills
This shit was a dream to me
But I turned my dreams to real
They say a nigga went left
But I think I did some right
Cause I was jigging for a fight
Now Im watching million dollar fights

When I was broke I was on a mission
When I was broke I was on a mission
Young nigga broke and I gotta get it,,
I'm on a grind like it's my religion
I just want to see the big figures
Don't you see the  bigger picture?
I just want to see the big figures
I wanna get it with my niggas

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
If they sleeping on you wake em up
Gotta get it ain't no waiting up
Think about it when I'm waking up
You heard it from me, ain't nothing in life free
I'm riding around with the same niggas
And we all got the same vision
(What you want?)
The motherfucking millions
I can see myself at the top of the Forbes list
Cause I saw myself broke, hungry, and strugglin'
Get off your ass and get it, get your own ticket
I do this shit for myself, and my city
And all the niggas who stay with me
Whether it's ugly or pretty
Whether it's ugly or pretty
All the eyes they against me
But I'm still rocking Fendi
