Man took a whole lot of work
Can't stop now can't get tired (yeah)
Got 2 jobs one side
They make more than my 9 to 5
Tell shawty I had a dream
I will make my family proud
Haters running through my veins man
Now I can finally say now
[?] how can you look the same
Man these minutes looking crazy
Ain't no problem man I gotta get it
Ain't gift and for some maybes
I got to provide for my baby
Being for him on the daily
Ain't no time to bag no more meat
Time to bag a big crazy

Riding on man one no

[Yamine]

(Verse 2: Yamine)
Man this took a lotta work
No more pain man no more hurt
Bag a for by no more fed
I need that worth
Fuck a bitch and get worked
I was tippin hard that she twerked
Throwing 1's and tens then forties and 50s
She began to work
90 buy 9
That's whole lot of a cedar
40 buy 5
That's whole open seater
Driving my car like a new bag of weeder
Now I'm back with a whole new seeder
Fallin backwards and landin' on fours
Fighting through this pain
I won a whole lot of awards
Spitting these verses like I make the chorus
I made it to the top
And now these haters all fold
Haven't seen my niece
And haven't seen my preist
4 months don passed now
And I'm ending up with beef
Worst Uncle of the year
Now Rae Sremmurd on my beats
Mikewillmade-it and Lil Hype
Becomes the beast (yeah bro)

(Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & [Swae Lee])
Work, work [woah, woah]
Came to the, just came from the dirt, dirt, (skrrr, glah]
Ain't no time to play gotta work, work [uh, yeah]
Man this took a whole lotta hurt, hurt
[man this took a whole lotta hurt]
Man this took a whole lotta
Work, work [woah]
Came to the, just came from the dirty, dirty [dirt]
Man they took a whole lot of work, work
[man it's middle term]
Man it's middle term
