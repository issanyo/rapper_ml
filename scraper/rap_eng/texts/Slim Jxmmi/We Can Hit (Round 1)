[Chorus]
You say you stickin' to the script
Save that poppin’ at the lip and put your hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
Grab a shovel, can you dig?
In my zone, we splittin' wigs
Ain't no time for talkin’ shit
Put yo' hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)

[Verse 1]
Bitches talkin' reckless, they trippin', they whole necklace
I don't need nobody, I'm showin' up and I'm wreckin’ shit (I am)
Bitches throwin’ shade, more wave, but I ain't sweatin’ it (I ain't)
I can beat yo' ass without puttin' any effort in
Your nigga identical to what’s between yo' legs and shit (Pussy)
Penny-pinchin' ass bitch, you stay on some petty shit
Respect this shit or you gon' end up injured by your neck and shit
We niggas gon' grab one, my niggas catchin' checks and shit
My people ready bitch

[Chorus]
You say you stickin' to the script
Save that poppin' at the lip and put your hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
Grab a shovel, can you dig?
In my zone, we splittin' wigs
Ain't no time for talkin' shit
Put yo' hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still a ghetto, pistol holdin', but I got them hands
Knock the fuck up out a nigga, meet me where you fuckin' stand
Bitch please, I'm like Creed, don't I make a nigga bleed?
Any day, catch a fade, and have you leakin' in the street
Bitch, I be on that stupid shit, I be goin' crazy dude
I been throwed off, Draco before middle school
Standin' real tall, like he hard, but his ass soft
Got a glass jaw, I'm a mothafuckin' southpaw, yeah

[Chorus: Crime Mob & Slim Jxmmi]
You say you stickin' to the script
Save that poppin' at the lip and put your hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
Grab a shovel, can you dig?
In my zone, we splittin' wigs
Ain't no time for talkin' shit (Yeah)
Put yo' hands up, nigga
We can hit (Ayy, Jxm), we can hit (Ayy, Jxm)
We can hit (Ayy, Jxm), we can hit

Huh, call yo' team, boy
Huh, you a green, boy
Why you makin' a scene, boy?

TKO just because he wanna be tough (Tough)
Bet you fold (Fold) when somebody call your bluff (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You say you stickin' to the script
Save that poppin' at the lip and put your hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)

We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)

[Verse 4]
Crank it up in the parkin' lot, what these bitches talkin' 'bout?
Lately I been seein' a lot, lately I been hittin' the lot
Gold gloves, gold gloves, I don't remember where the apartment was
You remember me from m-o-b, throwin' bows, c-a-t-e
Nigga don't impress me, test me
Talkin' 'bout fuck shit, fuck around gon' be in the ICU
Nigga forever we come through and nigga, we gon' hit
If you talkin' 'bout stank ho, DJ Domo

[Chorus]
You say you stickin' to the script
Save that poppin' at the lip and put your hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
Grab a shovel, can you dig?
In my zone, we splittin' wigs
Ain't no time for talkin' shit
Put yo' hands up, nigga
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
We can hit (We can hit), we can hit (We can hit)
