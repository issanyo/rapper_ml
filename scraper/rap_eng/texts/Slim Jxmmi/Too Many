[Intro: Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I smoke too much dank, I smoke too much dank
I have too much drank, I have too much drank
I'm on too many things, on too many things (high)
On too many things, on too many things (you know it)
Niggas actin' lame, looking at me strange (fuck 'em)
I just fucked her once, I don't know her name
I'm on too many things, on too many things
I'm on too many things, on too many things

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Hey, yeah, yeah
I'm on too many things, your bitch gon' let me bang
These bitches off the chain, my nuts, I let 'em hang
I got my money on my mind, it ain't gon' never change
No matter how much dough you get, I know you still a lame
You still ain't in the gang, I'm still up in the game
Send them my condolences, I'm 'bout to kill a game
Got a bitch named Mary Jane and that bitch is flame
I feel like I'm at the crib when I'm in the bank
I'm on too many thing, she on too much 'cane
I pull up in Mulsanne, take up too many lanes
They drive that bitch insane, she wanna give me brain
And you know we can't smoke it if it ain't that dank

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I smoke too much dank, I smoke too much dank
I have too much drank, I have too much drank (you know it)
I'm on too many things, on too many things
On too many things, on too many things
Niggas actin' lame, looking at me strange
I just fucked her once, I don't know her name
I'm on too many things, on too many things
I'm on too many things, on too many things

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Too many people, that be too many voices
And there's 300 bitches and 'bout 400 horses
And 'bout 500 Porches, get 600 extorted
Niggas actin' like hoes
Then they ass get escorted up out the club hoe
With the snub nose
Who the hell you gonna try?
Eyes low
Hanging too high to a point where it feel like I already died
No lie, can't reply to the textes that I get
Smokin', sippin' liquor now, used to be on that other shit, but ayy
Too many names, too many dames, I can't complain
Too many ways, too many things I can't explain
Too many people, too many photos, so when they change
The day I do some dumbass shit, then lead the gang

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I smoke too much dank, I smoke too much dank
I have too much drank, I have too much drank (you know it)
I'm on too many things, on too many things
On too many things, on too many things
Niggas acting lame, looking at me strange
I just fucked her once, I don't know her name
I'm on too many things, on too many things
I'm on too many things, on too many things
