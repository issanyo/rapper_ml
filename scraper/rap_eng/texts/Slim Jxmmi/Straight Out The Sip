Sremmlife shit..., this is that sip shit
Mississippi get the fuck up right now, lets go!
Oh Ya!

[Hook: Bo Bo Swae]
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!
Straight out the sip, straight out the sip!

[Verse 1: Impxct]
Holy matrimony, this my testimony
Yellow macaroni, she just acting lonely
I got a tip like T.I. can flip
I take yo sack smoke it straight out the zip
Im about my [?] it dont care how you feel
Where am I from...STRAIGHT OUT THE SIP
Can from the ground and you niggas can't stand it
You falling out, need to get some new balance
If I take your sack you can call me bandit
Charge into the gate like a [?]
She wanna fight wanna marigold
I see right through her no telescope
[?] ain't no letting go
You can turn in to my episode
Tryna slide, i might provide
Roll my number, gave her no replies
Don't ask no questions we got supplies
