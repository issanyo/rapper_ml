I'm back to tossin' these bitches

[Verse 1: Riff 3x]
I'm back to tossin' these bitches
I hit for an hour and I had to leave that cunt on the floor
I tell a bitch that I gotta go piss
And i wipe off my dick, chuck the deuce, adi√≥s
I hit a bitch on the bed, on the floor
It don't matter when it come to tossin' these hoes (Smash)
I treat a bitch how she need to be treated, my nigga
Because that's just how the game goes (Woo)
I hit a bitch on her mama's couch (Woah)
Insertin' this lumber off in her mouth (Okay)
I had a bitch from Flordia
The first time I met her, she let me set her out (Woah)
If i can't split you with my friends (I can't)
Then we ain't got nothin' to talk about (Hell no)
I don't break bread with you bitches (For what?)
That's just some shit y'all don't know about (Okay)
We don't fall in love with bitches (Nah)
We just toss 'em and then we kick 'em out (Toss 'em)
Me and you niggas ain't friends (What?)
I'm just tryna put this dick off in your spouse (Ugh)
Say my name around these bitches (Riff, Riff)
And they gon' already know what you're talkin' bout (What you sayin'?)
I got understandin' with these bitches (Okay)
If I fuck her, she know that I'm sendin' her out (Toss)

[Chorus: Riff 3x & Slim Jxmmi]

Walked in the club, I'm ready for action (Let's go)
White girl with me and she lookin' like Pam (Woo)
I just want you niggas be turnin' around
I'm back to doggin' these bitches
My nigga gon' fuck her, we all 'bout to clown (Ugh)
Who the fuck you thought it was?
Boy, yeah I came from the ground (Sremm)
Shawty diggin' my style (Swag)
Yeah, I'm young and I'm wild (Slim)
Drive that car so fast, I don't give a fuck, man the engine growl
I'm back to doggin' these bitches, I'm flexin' on niggas
You was hatin' on me when I was broke, now I'm richer (Uh)
Check my position, check my position

Don't you be playin' around like you know the game
Nah, nigga you know my name

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Designer hoes are all on the bros
When I show up, you can tell that I'm stoked
I'll chop the top in the plaza in front of everybody
While I got my seat back and I'm gettin' the sloppiest of the sloppy (Damn!)
Riff3x, Swae Lee, Slim Jxm showed face at the fuckin' bar mitzvah
To give a bad bitch a tongue twister
And I came through like a A-lister
Put a chick in a flick and i told her that it what is and it was what it was (Go 'head)
Got a windbreaker full of good smokes and I'm crackin' down on these hoes (Sniff up)

[Chorus: Riff 3x]
I'm back to tossin' these bitches (Toss)
I'm back to doggin' these hoes (Bitch)

I'm back to tossin' these hoes (Flip, flip)
I'm back to tossin' these bitches (Bitch)
I'm back to doggin' you hoes (Damn)
We don't break bread with you bitches (No)
We don't fall in love with hoes (For what?)
