They plan to catch me fuck her know the popstar
Fuckin' up in a hotel why the hoes bell

[Verse: Slim Jxmmi]
Your bitch tryna to get a little fame
She must [?] by her nigga name
I love the way she want it [?]
She goin' to the crew she know the game
I came up from an other side town
This nigga squirrel then I come around
I pullin' up in her body for the thirty soul
I keep them freaky hoes in my house
I fuckin' all the bitches in your town
You know they know Slim Jxmmi come around
You know that shit about to get woaw

3 hoes with me that's any chill
I'm bout to brick that [?] pow pow

They plan to catch me fuck her know the popstar
Fuckin' up in a hotel why the hoes bell
