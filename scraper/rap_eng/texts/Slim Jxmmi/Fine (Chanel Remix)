I take her to Chanel cause she fly
I take her to Chanel cause she fire
I fuck around and call that bih’ a dime
Let her paint her fingernails, that’s my sign
Whatever she want, let her buy
The new makeup, she beat up, apply
With my tricks, yeah, I try to be sly
I take her to Chanel cause she fine
I take her to Chanel cause she fly
I take her to Chanel cause she fire
I fuck around and call that bih’ a dime
Let her paint her fingernails, that’s my sign
Whatever she want, let her buy
The new makeup, she beat up, apply
With my tricks, yeah, I try to be sly
I take her to Chanel cause she fine

[Verse 1: Henry Draw]
Just stepped out the Gucci store, fucked my loyalty
But I spent so much, still treated like royalty
Hop out the whip with like 20K, joyfully
So much in cash I just bought out the property (ey!)
Brush my teeth, take a piss, pick out the boogers
Used to do that all before you all knew me
Now I’m still doing that all again
But this time I need racks so I can throw all it back
She fine
So focused on shoppin’, hear wood chimes chime
CC made the bitch go nine to the dime
That bitch wanna get with me, so wait in line
Like Travis and Sean, make it go straight up now
Wind and hear turbines, she Delta airline
Body like angles, she 3D but sides
I cracked the hypo, next to me like cosign
Around me so much think she built a shrine
Voice like an angel, think I might just sign
Body like angles, like glass with the wine
Running out of ways to my girl divine

Whatever she want, let her buy (she's fine)

[Verse 2: Henry Draw]
Aye, we border each other, welcome’ home Meek
Just make sure you stay off purple drink
Or the turtles will find you, the red and the shriek
And yo’ bitchass slaughtered by the homie Shiek
That’s just my technique
I really have no faith in you, no trust
Hanson, but the cops can’t make a bust
Throw a wrench in your plan, and you starting’ to rust
And yo’ bitch is a wench, Lil Baby no dawg
And I’m Russian to get the fuck out the gulag
I can’t catch a case, I just digital dash
And I’m makin’ a splash, write it down in my log
I’m from another planet, yeah this just my plan
Like a hermit crab, I Dash right out the van
Sebastian, the death just like a clam
6 movies, I move it, while you just keep stan
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just so you know, I can flow, and since December I’ve moved up from the low
