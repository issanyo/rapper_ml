[Interlude: Slim Jimmy]
I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that

[Hook 2x: Slim Jimmy]
Swimming in this cash, I woke up like that
Grabbing on her ass, I woke up like that
Spending money fast, I woke up like that
Feel like Johnny Cash, I woke up like that

I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that, I woke up like that
I woke up like that

[ Verse 1: Iamdominiquelee]
I wake up and say to god I be like damn I'm from Kentucky
I don't be flexing I get up and do it your girlfriend be texting like shit I be coolin
My daughter's a blessing I gotta be reckless don't ever come to me unless you my shooter
Niggas be laughing I never do gas em I get up I pass em like who that be zooming
They say I be thuggin' who say I be thuggin' don't tell me to listen cause you not my brother
Don't come to my section not talking bout money let's teach you a lesson look we not discussing
My mama say fuck em really go fuck em I tell her these women I never can trust em
I tell you these women I never can trust em I ride by my self and I tell you I love it hold up
I don't be playing no games my niggas be riding you know that we special
I pull up in silence I dare you to try it women be looking like he not a buster wait
I just had dream about me scoring
I be grinding by myself and watch me wake up in a foreign go

[Hook 2x: Slim Jimmy]
Swimming in this cash, I woke up like that
Grabbing on her ass, I woke up like that
Spending money fast, I woke up like that
Feel like Johnny Cash, I woke up like that
