[Intro]
Run it, oh
Yo
Ear Drummers
I ain't even got a blunt right now?
This ain't me, who this is?

[Chorus]
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck?
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh?

[Verse 1]
Damn, I done came up, now a nigga stackin' green
I could go and buy Supreme but I'm in love with Gucci jeans
Shawty in love with my steez, bring these bitches to their knees
I got all this fuckin' swag and I can't even (sigh)
I can't even stop it
All these watches that I want, I stack it up, then cop it
Guess the lesson of the day is keep stackin' your dollar
And them bitches chasin' me so I ain't gotta holla

[Chorus]
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck?
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh?

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I feel like Jay-Z the way I'm pullin' strings
Feel like I wrote the book the way I'm runnin' game
They think I'm a crook the way I take her
I don't even wanna call the hoe 'cause she on go
Ayy, Uncle Jxmmi fresh, I'm talkin' head to toe
Ayy, I'm still puttin' on for Tupelo
Ayy, I treat a 20 like a groupie hoe
Head down, head up, get down on the floor

[Chorus]
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck?
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh?
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck?
Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya?
You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies
Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh?
