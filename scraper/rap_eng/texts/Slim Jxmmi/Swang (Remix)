[Intro: Travis Scott]
Young niggas, young niggas ready to go
I'm a young, young nigga got me fucked up
I'm a young, young nigga let's pour up (yeah)
Young niggas, young niggas ready to go
I'm a young, young nigga got me fucked up
I'm a young, young nigga let's pour up (yeah)
Young niggas, young niggas ready to go
I'm a young, young nigga got me fucked up
I'm a young, young nigga let's pour up (yeah)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Big body hoggin' up the lanes, whip so big it's like a plane (yah!)
Tattoos on my body and my face, you know a young nigga can't be tamed
You don't want no problems this-a-way (oh my god)
I got blue and red flags in my gang
They say "where you get them boogers in your fangs?" (lit)
You know I had to hit up Johnny Dang (bling, bling bow, bow)
Ya, ya, I need that ice ahí, I need that ice ahí
Give me just what I need (straight up), ya, all them gon' ride for me
Go and bend down for me, never gon' cop a plea

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Pass me one while I'm grippin' 'grain
Don't hit the window don't hit the brakes
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
We young niggas you can't hang (oh no)
You know my young niggas can't be tamed (alright!)

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Young niggas, young niggas ready to go
I'm a young, young nigga got me fucked up
I'm a young, young nigga let's pour up (yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
If I say I got it then you know I got it, yuh
Bands, bands, bands, can't fit in my pocket (alright)
Take off with me now, take off on my rocket (It's lit)
Smash everything in Aces now we off to Follies (ooh)
Now we on our own drivin' with suspension
Ones, ones, ones, that's that repetition (straight up)
Pimpin', Johnny Gill that's that new edition
La Flame Don Juan young nigga pimpin' (heee)
All you can handle, I rock that bitch off the handles (yah)
She bust it open like sandals, mess with the flannels
Diamonds go hard with the flannels (nahh)
Don't need to control her (It's lit)
I change my bitch like a channel (ahh)
Young niggas inside and I got young niggas
Young niggas with me (Straight up)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Tattoos on my body and my face
You know them young niggas can't be tamed
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't never stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
Sremmlife!

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
