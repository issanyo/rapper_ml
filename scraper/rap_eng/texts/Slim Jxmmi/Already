[Intro: Juicy J]
Security fucked up let me bring the zip in
Yo bitch missing we both missing we both disappear
If I pull up in that Phantom she gon' disappear
If I pull up in a Phantom we gon' disappear

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Let's talk money shit I'm rich already
Let's get freaky baby call me Robert Kelly
I'm at Penthouse watching bitches shake their jelly
Weed and Liquor make her look like Halle Berry
I'm lit don't wear no panties
Let them kids stay with their granny
This dick you about to swallow save that fuck shit for your marriage
Ho I'm Juicy J, to fuck me is a dream
Ziploc full of trees, hypnotize your mind then I leave
Money over hoes by any means, me
Eight hundred thousand in jewelry I got Egyptian needs
Grab my Phantom keys, pour me a little lean
You niggas out here saving thots I share 'em with the team
Fuck boy (But anyway...)

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Already told you niggas that I ain't gon' play
Already told my ho she better stop complaining
Damn that nigga already got that shiny bezel
Told that nigga I'm already on another level
Local thotties at this party already bopping
I just walked in thirty seconds getting topped off
God damn why I keep on shaking niggas hot sauce?
Pull up in that new Camaro I just left that sky loft
I promise I've already sipped, woah
I told your ho come take a trip
If she bite then I know Iâ€™m fucking
If she hop inside the passenger I know I'm busting

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up
