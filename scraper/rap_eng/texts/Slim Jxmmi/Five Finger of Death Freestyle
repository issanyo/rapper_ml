[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I don't freestyle, cuz my style ain't free
It been a while since I  rode around on E
Hol' up, I just caught the wrong beat
I got a long dick, shawty want fo' me to skeet
All I got is cash, I'm gon' buy a new lamb
Hit ya shawty from the side, woo!, wam, bam
I'm on Sway up In the Morning, I just counted one hunnid
All my bitches bad and they drive an H3 Hummer
I can check my wrist, hoo, watch my elbow pop
Niggas hattin' from the side, they know they need to stop
Cash out on a yacht, then I cash out on the crib
In your neighborhood, I make noise like where I live
Please do not disturb, shitting on a nigga, I'm a muthafuckin' turd
All these niggas wanna know what the word
I'm soo fly like a muthafuckin' bird!

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Don't freestyle, cuz my style ain't free
I'm tired niggas takin' my swag on the beats
I'm tired niggas walkin' 'round town like they me
I'm tired bitches actin' like they weave ain't cheap

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
SremmLife comin' soon, SremmLife comin' soon
I thumb through like a hundred K like every afternoon
I'm married to the money, I'm the muthafuckin' groom
I never jumped the broom, my crib got seven rooms
You know what's up with me, I'm geekin' off a pill
I told ya ho fo' real, Mike Will, ay, sign that deal
I got in Interscope, I stay fresh like some scope
They treat me like the pope, my flow soo fuckin' dope, ugh!

[Interlude: Swae Lee (Slim Jimmy)]
Do this ery day
Sway, Sway, we do this ery day
Sway, Sway, all my hoes gay
(One to the head, one to the head, one to the head and you dead
One to the head, and you dead)

[Verse 4: Swae Lee]
She like me, cuz I drink a lot of vodka
Shout out to my homie, Future, you monsta
Drinks on us, drinks on us
Shawty say I need to chill, I smoke too much
Every day I do, I cash out on such and such
I'm in that H3 and I'm bout to bust a nut
