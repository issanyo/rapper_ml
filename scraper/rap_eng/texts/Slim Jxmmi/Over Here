[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Why you over here? (Why are you over here?)
Sremm over here (Sremm life)
Broke niggas all in the club but they ain't over here
Nah they ain't with the set
I make it rain til she wet
I sign my name on her chest
She kiss the G's on my belt, she Gucci
If I'm in the club I own it
If it ain't gas, I don't want it
Your bad bitches look borin'
My bad bitches look foreign
Them green guys like a green light, them bad bitches be goin'
I fucked your girl last night
And my niggas fucked her this mornin'
Charlie Sheen is my clone, can they fuck with us? No
Red carpet my home, VIP is my throne
Take me out of my zone I'ma take your ho
All my niggas on go, everything on go

[Verse 2: BoBo Swae]
Chris Vernace red bottoms on the ball with the bottles no shots
We mergin' up the models, that's thots kissin' thots
I got a pocket full of condoms, I fucked your bitch yesterday
We do this shit every day, she got a tattoo of BoBo Swae
It's on her ass now
She like pink diamonds with the fiji water, make her pass out
It's big bank when I'm in the club, I'm a walking lick
That's why I'm talkin' shit
So don't disrespect
Cause I'm with the set bitch
It's Hollyhood in the 'Ville, we all got the check
We, Swae, Mike WiLL, Miley Cyrus, made it mafia in this bitch
We got special effects, check the stats
You know what it is, we in this bitch, we in this bitch

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hakuna matata, I came in with my partners
Hakuna matata, I'ma red carpet walker
50 bad bitches drinkin' vodka like it's water
But who you know over here?
Oh your ho over here?
Ain't no joke over here
On the loud blowin' stronger than anybody you know
On got your ho on my ho
Oh the devil comin', now she on my culo
I'm Superman feein' supernatural, fuck two hoes (Clark Kent)
And you know who got the Hublots, makin' Batman signals in the air (Bruce Wayne)
I make 'em send 100 bottles to the section that's comin' for the quick check
My world class bitch takin' shot after shot cause she fully automatic with the clip
She bust it like a nina for the set and I
I'm swimmin' in your bitch rockin' from side to side
