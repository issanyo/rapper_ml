[Verse 1: Khalid]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus: Khalid]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
We kept our last few hundreds (yeah)
Spread out just like a fan (hey)
She memorized my number (ooh)
Same one from 2010 (oh, yah)
And we're living it up, forget about sorrow (oh)
Party all night (night)
Same time tomorrow
Keeping my cool (cool)
Making my moves (ooh)
Young, dumb and broke, dreams coming true

[Chorus: Khalid]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 3: Khalid & Slim Jxmmi]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live (hey!)
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke (skrt, skrt!)
But we still got love to give (Uncle Jxm, aye)

[Verse 4: Slim Jxmmi]
Never thought it would be like this (SremmLife)
I never thought it could be like this (woo!)
Remember when I used to drive the hooptie, oh yeah (yeah)
I'm coming in that Lamb' I'm 'bout to scoop you, oh yeah
I know the last time that you see me I was broke (ah)
Pull up for my city, graduated blue and gold (ah)
Don't tell me how to do it, you ain't did this shit before (ah)
Y'all niggas winning if you watching peep the scope (ah)
We get it while we young dumb

[Chorus: Khalid and Lil Yachty]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada (Lil Boat)
Young dumb broke high school kids (Lil Boat, Lil Boat)

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Young, dumb and broke (yah)
Back in high school Boat was so emotional
Now I'm super rich and everything I do is so promotional (yah)
I didn't finish college, so my momma thought I wouldn't be shit
I had to prove her wrong (yah)
That's why I talk about her now in every single song
Had to struggle for a while (I did)
Just so I could live it up when it's time to live (ok)
I knew something had to give (yah)
Broke as hell using Lyft (why?)
I could never get a lift, now they all want one from me (damn)
Stay away from the fiends, message from the King of the Teens

[Chorus: Khalid and Lil Yachty]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke (Lil Boat)
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb (yeeeah)
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids (-high school kids)
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
It's the American Teen and the King of the Teens
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
