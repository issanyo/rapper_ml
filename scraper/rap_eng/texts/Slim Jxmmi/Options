[Intro: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Hey
Hey, yeah
Ayy

[Verse 1: Impxct]
How you hatin' on a young nigga like me when you know I'm the topic?
Twistin' all black like I'm Black Robby, like I'm gotchic
She say she wanna come ride, she wanna come and hop inside
How you a teacher, you sittin' in the bleachers
You actin' like you got bread and you don't (broke ass)
Comin' through with ice on my wrist
Finna go and ice out my bitch
Finna go and ice out my clique
Young nigga ballin', no assist
Yeah, I'm chillin' at the Ritz
With a bad yellow foreign bitch
And she flew out from Olso, Norway just to chill with me
Porsche truck go zoom (zoom)
Coupe ain't got no room (yeah yeah)
Malibu need a tune (tune)
Chevy need a tune (yeah)
Coupe ain't got no roof (uh uh)
Yeah that shit smooth (hold up)
I do this for the youth (yeah)
I do this for the youth (sauce, damn damn, huh)

[Chorus: Impxct]
Coupe ain't got no room
Malibu go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan
Coupe ain't got no room
Chevy it go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I'ma hit third base, super soon (hey)
Suicide on my doors, I'm going Doctor Doom (whoa)
Aye aye, all aboard (yeah)
Fifty stacks on my ironing board (hey)
Driver leaning forward, good afternoon (it's past noon)
I'm a bag fan of the coupe (drop), and the trunk with the torque (yeah)
Where's your passport? my ice on ski resort
Bad bitches cheerlead, don't be a bad sport

[Chorus: Impxct]
Coupe ain't got no room
Malibu go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan
Coupe ain't got no room
Chevy it go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
Engine in the trunk (hey), backpack in the hood (whoa)
California Rari (California Rari) but I ain't Hollywood (I ain't Hollywood)
Feeling good, I impress, thirty thousand dollars stuffed in my Amiri jeans (stuffed)
Lil mama off the X, offered me a pill, told her I prefer the weed
Zoom zoom zoom (zoom zoom zoom)
Dancing on the moon (dancing on the moon)
Wet like monsoon (wet like monsoon)
Coupe ain't got no room (coupe ain't got no room)
Too much money young nigga, nah never heard of that (huh?)
Taking pictures of the foreign 'cause it look better when the roof ain't attached, hey

[Chorus: Impxct]
Coupe ain't got no room
Malibu go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan
Coupe ain't got no room
Chevy it go zoom
Jeep ain't got no doors
I'm ballin' Michael Jordan

[Outro: Impxct]
Hell nah I can't take my chains off, the fuck?
