[Intro: Slim Jxmmi]
Ear Drummers
30, you a fool for this one
Jxm, yeah

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (grindin')
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (no money)
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up, shut up)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (shut it up)
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (woo)
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (they talkin')
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up, ayy)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (Jxm)

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Fuck the Instagram 'cause all these bitches be photoshoppin' (yeah)
Catch me in SoHo shoppin' (shop), maybe with your hoe thottin' (thot)
Broke nigga talkin' that nonsense (fuckboy), we ain't got nothin' in common (no)
Rich nigga still eat ramen (rich) and I'm so hot like Austin (hot)
And I'm so smart like Carlton (ugh), blowin' purp at the Ritz Carlton
Backwoods make me nauseous, new niggas make me cautious (Jxm)
I'm a young nigga, I'm saucy (me), you a broke nigga, you salty (you)
All of your diamonds look faulty (lookin'), all of my diamonds look glossy

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Trouble]
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (grindin')
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (no money)
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up, shut up)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (shut it up)
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (huh, wooh)
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (yeah, they talkin')
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (Jxm)

[Verse 2: Trouble]
I hear all the chitter-chatter, pay no mind I just fill my blunt up (yeah, yeah)
Wit the yac while your bitches gather, in my hood then we hit 'em after (yeah, smash)
So do me a favor, keep all the gossip on ten, you help me get poppin' I'm in (in)
Just like the perps, know you like 'em, get too close, diamonds might fuck round and bite 'em
Kept me in the bluff, I'm plottin', hard to fold up on a wrist rocket
Chain like a goddamn Nazi, all white diamond, good God shit
Eh, yeah, yeah, bitch I play above the rim (yeah, yeah)
This Big Trouble and Uncle Jxm, you be hatin' yeah we know 'cause your pockets slim

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (grindin')
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (no money)
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up, shut up)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (shut it up)
Niggas flexin', they ain't really grindin' though (wooh)
Niggas talkin', they ain't got no money though (they talkin')
Niggas talkin' loud when they ain't got no guap (shut up)
Bitches talkin' loud when they ain't really poppin' (Jxm)
