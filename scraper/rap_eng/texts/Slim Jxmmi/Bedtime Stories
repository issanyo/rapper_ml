Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Oh, girl, stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare
Oh, girl, you can stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Go ahead and say it
You feel every word that I'm sayin'
Hundred somethin' thousand on the table
I ain't mean to throw it in your face
I don't wanna play those games
I'm not tryna hide my pain
Nigga say he's ballin', I'm like same, same, same, same
She love a different nigga every day

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Slim Jxmmi]
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know (tell me you know)
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah (Jxm, ayy)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
You tell me lies, you tell me lies and I'ma listen (ayy, ayy)
You outta your mind, and I'm a witness (I'm nasty at all)
I'm diggin' your vibe, I'm diggin' your vision (diggin' your vision)
And in the night, we do no kissin', ayy (ain't doin' no kissin')
I can come but I can't stay (yeah)
Just put that love on layaway (lawaway)
It's always you I put in first place (it's always you)
It's always you I put in first place (ayy)

[Refrain: Slim Jxmmi]
But ayy, girl, you can stop right there (yeah, there)
Fallin' in love is my worst nightmare (can't do it)
I said, ayy, girl, you can stop that there (woah, stop it)
Fallin' in love is my worst nightmare (Jxm!)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Oh, girl, you can stop that right there
Fallin' in love, not your worst nightmare

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hittin' me with that cold stare
Sayin', "Can you help me take these down?"
Talkin' about your box braids
Five minutes later, I'm takin' you down
Now you're callin' my name
Thinkin' of me when you're out and about
Ooh, pray for your crew
Pray for your crew, make 'em salute
Watch how I move, cash comin' through
Watch what you do and what you choose

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm not tryna tell you bedtime stories
I'm not like those other niggas talkin' to you
I'm not lookin' at you, I'm lookin' right through you
Said I'm not like those other niggas that pursue you
You know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know
Tell me you know, tell me you know, yeah
