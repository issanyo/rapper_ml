[Intro: Jake Paul]
You know, kids
Back in my day
The only thing lit on Christmas were the lights
Now you kids are running around with your shenanigans
Holes in your pants
Social medias
It's like everything's lit
I heard someone say "Litmas"

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas

[Verse 1: Jake Paul]
I'm the young Santa Claus, put respect on my name
Put nitros in my sleigh, now my shit spit flames
Check the naughty list and you'll see our names
Red and white whip, looking like candy canes
It's a Litmas-sleigh switching them lanes
Side-chick, Mrs. Claus just be playing these games
Can't hang with the lames, red and green on the chains
Custom Christmas Gucci frames, it's a Litmas, bro

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I put a Lamborghini Murcielago on my Christmas list (Lambo)
I buy that shit myself if Santa don't deliver it (cash out)
I can fly like a reindeer in this damn designer fit (designer)
And I got this Christmas tree, I'm bout to wrap it like a gift (spark up)
Mrs Claus and all her friends inside my swimming pool (splash)
Litmas, this Christmas, we breaking all the rules
Coal in her stocking, I guess she been naughty too
My birthday next week so get ready for the Litmas 2

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas

[Verse 3: Jake Paul]
Christmas is lit, Christmas be the shit
Christmas make me wanna post family pics
My parents are divorced, I made two Christmas lists
It's just so they know not to get the same shit
Coal in my stocking so I bought myself a whip (skrt)
Like I said my Christmas is lit

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas
Christmas is lit
Christmas, Litmas
