[Intro]
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Jump in the Pegasus (on them horses)
All kinda reckless the necklace (yeah, we bad)
All kinda reckless I flexed it (yeah)
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly (hey)
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus (on them horses)
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist (woah, yeah)
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin' (on them horses, skrrt!)
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it (woo, yeah)

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Lil' Jxm', I got a problem (hey)
I'm in love with money, I'm in love with ballin' (yeah)
Gotta keep my phone on vibrate, how these bitches callin' (brrr, brrr)
Neiman Marcus' shawty and I ain't window shoppin' (yeah)
2K on my feet, yeah, 2K, I be kickin' game (game)
Bubble Gum OG, I'm smokin' on a different strain (woo)
Niggas stealin' sauce, they need to stay up in their lane (lane)
Baby, we on top and that ain't ever gonna change (Sremm)
Put you boys to shame (shame on you)
Pull them foreign's out
And put you boys to shame (shame on you)
Going hard on a bitch like Major Payne (yeah, yeah)
Say my name (Jxm)
They ain't know how to spell it, so I put it on my chain (skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Jump in the Pegasus (on them horses)
All kinda reckless the necklace (yeah, we bad)
All kinda reckless I flexed it (yeah)
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly (hey)
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus (on them horses)
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist (woah, yeah)
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin' (on them horses, skrrt)
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it (woo, yeah)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
All these, hundreds got me siftin' (yea, yeah)
G35, needs a liftkit (yeah)
Man dirty cup I'm grippin' I mean it's a pig pen
Leave your chick within five feet of me, wouldnâ€™t risk it (woo, risk)
Niggas cannot stop me, told 'em just to face it (brrrp)
Aston sittin' low (lower), damn I scraped it (hey)
She like, "Spread your wings, 'cause it's the Pegasus" (woo)
I'm like, "I might go and take the spot, because of negligence" (yeah)
Oh, barricades ain't holdin' me (ayy)
Money on me, but that ain't controllin' me
Last night had bitches bogin' me, like they go at me?
Took off on these niggas, caught a JetStream (yeah)

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Jump in the Pegasus (on them horses)
All kinda reckless the necklace (yeah, we bad)
All kinda reckless I flexed it (yeah)
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly (hey)
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus (on them horses)
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist (woah, yeah)
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin' (on them horses, skrrt) (yeah)
