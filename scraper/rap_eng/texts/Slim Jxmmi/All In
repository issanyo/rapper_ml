[Intro: Chris Brown]
All in, all in, all in

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I just hit the block rolling
I just got lit up, feeling little too loud, yeah
My pockets full of weed and Trojans, oh
Just might take over, get the mood right (mood right)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, woah
She's leaving with somebody she don't know (oh no)
Tryna get lit and let it go
Got so many bottles, she want some more
And you know what I'm on, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on
All this light, I know it's stinking, oh
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (going all in, ayy)
Dancing all night
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (going all in)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Yeah (jheeze!)
All in, all in (yeah)
My actions be talkin'
All I ever do is ball (ball)
I wanna do what LeBron did (oohl)
Oh, she like bottle poppers? (Huh)
Fuck it, I buy out the bar (yeah)
Said she never been to Cali (what?)
Fuck it, let's fly out tomorrow (ayy, let's go)
I'm feelin' right, D'usse on ice
Girl, what you doin' tonight? (Jheeze!)
The Bentley outside, ayy, I can see you on the passenger side (skrrt, skrrt)
Ayy, tell me what's in your cup, baby, tell me what's on your mind (Uncle Jim)
'Cause I ain't here to waste your time (SremmLife)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on, oh
All this light, I know it's stinking, oh (oh yeah)
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah (throw it up)
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (we be going all in)
Dancing all night
Going all in, all in, all in, all in  (we be going all in)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Sip some, sip some, twist some, twist some
Sip some, sip some, twist some, twist some
We got what they tryna be on
We got what they, oh yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinking on, oh
All this light, I know it's stinking, oh (oh yeah)
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah (throw it up)
Just throw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Going all in, all in, all in, all in (we be going all in)
Dancing all night
Going all in, all in, all in, all in  (we be going all in)
