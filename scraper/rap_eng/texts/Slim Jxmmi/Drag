[Hook: K Camp]
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, bag, bag
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, paid, paid cash
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, and I paid cash

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Drip, drag, mix, match
Gucci flops, Louis flag
Spent 30 on a bag
And I paid cash, paid-paid cash
Benz, Masi, no tags
Blowing Louis, gas mask
Smash, pass
Tag, fast
Make these niggas made
She gon' let me drag

[Hook: K Camp]
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, paid, paid cash
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, and I paid cash

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Double G's and double C's, I'm red carpet ready
These cameras love me like it's February
Gotta keep the money first, can't put it secondary
Yeah I paid cash for that '69 Chevy
Yeah I paid cash for that motherfucking Presi'
Every time I step out it looks like it's winter
Jewelry on Mr. Freeze, on Mr. Freeze
This money got me talking like I'm Mr. T

[Hook: K Camp]
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, paid, paid cash
Tag, tag, whip, fast, duffle bag, Louis flag
Louis rag, drip, drag
And I paid cash, and I paid cash
