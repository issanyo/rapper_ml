[Intro: Maluma]
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
Know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to

[Verse 1: Maluma]
Yeah you got a man, but I don't know that
It's hard to control when you work that back, yeah
Why don't we take one more sip just to hide the fact
That I'm 'bout to take one missed call 'fore it turns to trash
'Fore it turns to trash, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Maluma]
You throw your hips to the side, yeah
You got spice and your man don't know
You got your eyes on my eyes, yeah
We got plans that we're keepin' low
Don't change on your mind (don't change on your mind)
You got spice, but your girls don't know (they don't know)
We got plans, but we keep them low (keep it low)
We move fast, then we take it slow

[Chorus: Maluma]
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
Know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
Know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Yeah, I cannot read your mind
Don't think that I'm just talkin' trash
I know you want me, surely
Night's already passed, it's getting early
Roll some weed, call on some girls
Only if the vibes are right
I want you all to myself
I'm tryna blow your mind (hey)
Threesome, her friends overheard me
I left the girl, now she wanna hurt me (hurt me)
Spendin' my cash in a hurry
Killin' me softly, she had no mercy
Baby, you're drivin' me mental
Actually bad when I get near you
I was in my own space
You were so distant, that's what the tears do (yeah)
Don't go behind my back (my back)
If there's another, just fill me in (fill me in)
You're so, so deep in
Here you go pourin' your heart out again

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
You threw your hips to the side, yeah
You got spice and your man don't know
You got your eyes on my eyes, yeah
We got plans, but we'll keep them low
Don't change on your mind (don't change on your mind)
You got spice, but your girls don't know (they don't know)
We got plans, but we keep them low (keep it low)
We move fast, then we take it slow

[Chorus: Maluma, Swae Lee, Maluma & Swae Lee]
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
Know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
I know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
Jxm! Couldn't afford to waste any time (time)
I know she want me, she showin' signs (signs)
I'm livin' off a natural high
One time, baby, slow whine (slow wine, yeah)
Slow wine
Got me infatuated, you're so fine (hey)
Every time you step out, homicide
Make her mine, I gotta make her mine, yeah
Island girl like Rihanna (RiRi)
And she got potential, put that Birkin rag on her (Birkin)
Yeah, I let her lead and I follow (bad)
Yeah, and I'ma leave on a high note

[Bridge: Maluma & Slim Jxmmi]
Sigue movié-moviéndote pa' mí
Que mientras más te acercas, más me gusta tu body (hey)
Sigue moviéndote pa' mí
Que lo mejor ya viene luego en el after party
Te digo, girl

[Chorus: Maluma, Swae Lee, Maluma & Swae Lee]
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
Know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to
Baby, keep your hands on me
Know that I should leave, but I just can't leave you
I know you feel my energy
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to

[Outro: Maluma & Swae Lee]
If I took your heart, swear I didn't mean to
Can't leave you
If I took your heart, yeah, I didn't mean to
