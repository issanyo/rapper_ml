[Verse 2: Lil Lonnie]
They sayin' I'm oh so reckless, all these hoes getting hectic
Hoes calling my phone, but they get the voice message
Got all of them jealous, ain't shit, let 'em tell it
I know that these hoes hate it 'cause they see me doing better
Yeah my bitch so bad, you hoes so mad
Remember y'all flexed on me when I had no cash
Upped my standards on these bitches, I think these hoes so trash
Treat her like she's nothing then I drop her off so fast
My new bitch, yeah she is the shit, yeah she with the shit
Havin' racks, never gotta ask, she take me on trips
She loyal to me, you know I'm a player but she take this dick
She keep it real, I swear she a hundred, never counterfeit

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
I just got me a new bitch to make my old ho jealous
I swear she so bad, yeah she oh so precious
I don't give a fuck, they say I'm oh so selfish
I just got me a new bitch and now my old ho jealous
My old ho jealous, my old ho jealous
I swear she so bad, yeah she oh so precious
My old ho jealous, my old ho jealous
I just got me a new bitch and now my old ho jealous, yeah
