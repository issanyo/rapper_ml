[Intro: Slim Jxmmi]
Drinkin' on somethin'
Man I gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
Just chillin' with me with the haters doin' somethin'
Little Grey, gotta be drinkin' on somethin'
I'm smokin' on somethin', tryna go pop on somethin'
I ain't trippin', man I don't give a fuck if it's your girl
Man she drinkin' on somethin', have you smokin' on somethin'
Have you smokin' on somethin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Golly, golly, she love me, and
My woman, my ho, these women
Lit, lit, lit
Lit like Bic
SremmLife shit, bendin' by 6
2 by 2, 4 by 4
SremmLife shit, don't answer that door

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Neighbors keep knockin', bitches keep watchin'
Hoes keep jockin', but the money keep flockin'
They wishin' we was floppin', I can see it on their faces
I can point at different bitches
And I bet they all from different places
Look at all this money, lit, lit, lit
SremmLife shit, pop a chair sit
Poppa bear shit, I'm so grown
Brand new car, I'm so on
Yeah nigga what, all my niggas rich
All my bitches rich too so you need a key to come visit
News life shit, test this cup, test this cup, do it for us
Four eyed, damn, I'm twisted bad, I can feel it
Aquafina water, go ahead and pill it
Go ahead and pill it, do it if you dare
I just wanna lay it down and run my fingers right through her hair
Remove her underwear, lick, lick, lick
Lit sex yes, she show chest
Breathe in deep, geeked all week
Sunday night, Sunday fight
Argue, don't wanna argue
How could you think that I would ever leave you?
I see right through you
Get money with the same crew
I fuck the same hoes like you
Switch 'em out once a week, I'm cool
That's mid, I'm cool, damn
Midnight crew
Paint the Maserati midnight blue
Money pool, I'm 'bout to swim right through
Who are you?

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Who said they got that stanky loud? I wanna smell it
You say you run your fuckin' town, I let you tell it
Who really run the underground? I wanna meet you
Already tryna bite the style, you know we see you
Before I let my whole hood down I'll bring my team up
You say you run your fuckin' town, we need to link up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
I came from that dirty town, look how I clean up
Lick, lick like Jeeper's  Creepers
Wild boy in a wife beater
Hoppin' out of that two seater
Doot doot, that's a new Beamer
Bad bitches come see Jimmy
Just might leave a tip with you
Lit, lit, might spend a ticket
See if these red bottoms fit you
I'm doin' numbers, Sremm goin' bonkers
Bands bustin', better run for cover
Piped up, I might run for governor
I need bottles here on the double
I need bitches here on the double
I need condoms here on the double
Rae Sremmurd, that's double trouble

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Golly, golly, she love me, and
My woman, my ho, these women
Lit, lit, lit
Lit like Bic
SremmLife shit, bendin' by 6
2 by 2, 4 by 4
SremmLife shit, don't answer that door
