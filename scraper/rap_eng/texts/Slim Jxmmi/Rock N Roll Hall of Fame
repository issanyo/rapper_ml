[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Live so fast, I never take a pause (oh, woah)
No more talk, we're kickin' down the doors
I wouldn't trade this life for anything, it wouldn't be the same (same)
Everybody saw me takin' off (takin' off)
Fuckin' what they say, party hard (party hard)
Everyone around me is rock 'n roll hall of fame

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
We're the ones in charge now, who are y'all?
Looking at this chick like, 'Where we goin'?'
If you're not a ten, you can never get in my car
Jump out of the cab, tell 'em let my hand go (woo)
Diamonds everywhere and they dance like disco
Rubber bands pop, that's how I let my cash go
Need a wristband, bad bitch at my shows
Standin' on the stage like Axl Rose
If you can see my eyes, then you're way too close
Baby, I'm the one that had a scandal
I don't play the bass but I keep the band goin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Whip so fast, I never take a pause (oh, woah)
No more talk, we're kickin' down the doors
I wouldn't trade this life for anything, it wouldn't be the same (same, yeah)
Everybody saw me takin' off (takin' off)
Fuckin' what they say, party hard (party hard)
Everyone around me is rock 'n roll hall of fame (rock 'n roll hall of fame)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I don't need a Wraith to see the stars
I look into the mirror, there they are
No, I'm not Shawn Michaels but I'm breakin' hearts
And the way I'm living, it's so Rated R
Everyone 'round me fillin' up they cup
Smile for the camera, middle finger up
Look at my mouth and you gon' see a blunt
I might be leanin' like I need a crutch
If he a hater, I'ma let him hate
But if the energy negative, I stay away
25/8 I be up for the cake
25/8 I be up, boy
We takin' trips over the border
I got two girls in my bed and they bored
I'm feelin' pain, I don't know how to show it
Put on my chain and it feel like it's snowin'
Ear Drummer Records, we the bang
Keep a lil' hit on the charts and they know it

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Whip so fast, I never take a pause (oh, woah)
No more talk, we're kickin' down the doors
I wouldn't trade this life for anything, it wouldn't be the same (same)
Everybody saw me takin' off (takin' off)
Fuckin' what they say, party hard (party hard)
Everyone around me is rock 'n roll hall of fame

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Road rage in the Lamb' like a Dodge Durango
Three chains on, yeah, goin' Django
Ten days on the road, two days in the same clothes
Party so hard, I'm immune to hangovers
Hardy Boy, on God, jumpin' off the top rope
Me, I showboat, them, they do the utmost
Love her then I'm gone, I'm a rollin' stone
Flexin' what I have, young nigga macho

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Jump out of the cab, tell 'em let my hand go
Diamonds everywhere and they dance like disco
Rubber bands pop, that's how I let my cash go
Need a wristband, bad bitch at my shows

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Whip so fast, I never take a pause (oh, woah)
No more talk, we're kickin' down the doors
I wouldn't trade this life for anything, it wouldn't be the same (same)
Everybody saw me takin' off (takin' off)
Fuckin' what they say, party hard (party hard)
Everyone around me is rock 'n roll hall of fame
