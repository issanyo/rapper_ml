[Intro:]
Blow
Blow
Blow
Blow

[Hook:]
Hello ladies
How are we?
Hello ladies
How are we?
Don't throw shade
Throw parties
Don't throw fists
Throw parties
I'm gonna lean a little closer
Just so you're hearing every word that I say
It might take a little longer
For you to catch the new wave

[Verse 1:]
If you’ve got love for Dillon Francis, DJ Snake and Rae Srem
B, you gotta bust it open, let me see if it's real
When that whistle blow, I wanna see that ass touch the ceiling
You gotta do all of that shit that you would do with your friends
You gotta do all of that shit that you would do in the mirror
Go ahead and turn up with your bitches, let em know that you're here
Get low, get low, get low, get low
Get, get, get, get (get low when the whistle blow)

Low!

Low!

Low!

(Get, get, get low when the whistle blow)

[Bridge:]
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it
You should come and get it
You should come and get it, get it, get it
You should come and get it (get low when the whistle blow)

[Hook:]
Hello ladies
How are we?
Hello ladies
How are we?
Don't throw shade
Throw parties
Don't throw fists
[Throw parties]


[Verse 2:]

You gotta do all of that shit that you would do with your friends
You gotta do all of that shit that you would do in the mirror
Go ahead and turn up with your bitches, let em know that you're here
Get low, get low, get low, get low
Get, get, get, get (get low when the whistle blow)

Low!

Low!

Low!

Get, get, get, get (get low when the whistle blow)

[Bridge:]
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it while it's still hot
You should come and get it
You should come and get it
You should come and get it, get it, get it
You should come and get it (get low when the whistle blow)
