[Hook - King Dre]
My girl say "Why you do what you?"
And I reply... I'm just like you, I'm just like you
My girl say "Why you do what you?"
And I reply... I'm just like you, I'm just like you
And why you niggas hatin'? Smilin' in my face
When I'm, when I'm... Just like you, I'm just like you

[Verse 1 - Swae Lee]
Just like you, but I'm not you
I can feel the heat too, I look up to the sky too
Oh Lord, show me what to do
But they don't understand
I'm just like you, from a broken family that stood no chance
Uh, turn me up a little louder, say my name a little stronger
Why these niggas keep hatin'? Just like you, I don't want no problems
I don't wanna struggle no more, mamma don't wanna cry no more
Neighborhood, superstar, do you know what you lookin' up to me for?

And I reply... Because I'm just like you
I'm just like you, I'm just like you
And why these niggas hatin'? Smilin' in my face, when
When I'm, when I'm... Just like you
I'm just like you, I'm just not you

[Verse 2 - Slim Jxmmi]
I have some purple champagne to numb the pain
Reality is hard to explain
A part of me startin' to fade
Tell me you will always remember my name
Yeah, cause I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Neighborhood, superstar, I don't know what I'm searchin' for
And I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Cause I don't wanna struggle no more
And mamma don't wanna cry no more
Reality is hard to explain
A part of me startin' to fade
A part of me startin' to fade
Reality is hard to explain
