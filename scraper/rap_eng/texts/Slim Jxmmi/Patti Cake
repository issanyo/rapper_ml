[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Got the foreign whip sliding like it's on skates
On my way to see some ass shake (bitch)
Blow it in your face, that's patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Just throw them hundreds in your face (bitch)
Make that ass clap, patti cake

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Please play patty cake on my zipper
She a winner, I'm a big tipper
Ass cash like a slot and I wanna play
Put some change in her cellar straight
Back to the house, Gucci gas mask on
I be dropping bands like they atom bombs, damn!
Hoes running to me andale
Say they tryna stay in Mandalay, damn!
With them other hoes, ratchet hoes, freaky hoes
Stripper hoes, nasty hoes, can't forget them classy hoes
All this petty money on the floor (bitch)
Do the patti cake on your tippy toes

[Pre-Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
How fast can you shake that ass?
How fast can I throw the cash?
I hope you can throw that ass as fast as I throw the bands
Them hoes can't judge your ass
Damn sure can't control your ass
I don't really know your ass
But I'ma have to show your ass

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Got the foreign whip sliding like it's on skates
On my way to see some ass shake (bitch)
Blow it in your face, that's patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Just throw them hundreds in your face (bitch)
Make that ass clap, patti cake

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
So many hoes, so little time
Made a superstar status, now she skipping lines
Three point stance, go'n make that thing clap
Put your hands on your head, make that thing jump, bitch!
I got bands on standby
Soon as you set it off they gon' rain down
Let your friends pitch in, do the rain dance
I let my money talk for me, I don't got no pickup lines
I'm front row at your show tryna guess your size
My pockets fully loaded like I'm selling bean pies
I dropped a couple bands somewhere down the line
One question, why the hell you so damn fine?

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
How fast can I throw the cash?
How fast can you shake that ass?
I hope you can throw that ass as fast as I throw the bands
Them hoes can't judge your ass
They sure can't control your ass
I don't really know your ass
But I'm about to show your ass

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Got the foreign whip sliding like it's on skates
On my way to see some ass shake (bitch)
Blow it in your face, that's patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Make that ass clap, patti cake
Just throw them hundreds in your face (bitch)
Make that ass clap, patti cake
