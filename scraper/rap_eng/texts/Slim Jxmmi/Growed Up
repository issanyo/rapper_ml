[Verse 1]
(Uncle Jxmmi, yeah)
We ain't ridin' bikes no more, we ain't ridin' no scooters (ooh, ridin' no scooters)
Spent two thousand on these don't step on my shoes (ooh, wipe my shoes)
Word on the street, young Jxmmi got swag, got juice (ooh, Jxmmi got juice)
Just touched down in the city and I'm feeling brand new
Big diamonds on me, big ballin' is my lifestyle
My pockets so deep, I could prolly stuff a hunnid thou' (woo)
Baby, if you love me you gon' hold it down (woo, woo)
I'm on a money mission right now

[Chorus]
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up
Young, young nigga done growed up (ayy)

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, young, young nigga growed up (young nigga growed up)
I'm in the spot with the high-rollers (roll up)
New drop and it's souped up (souped up)
Makin' love to the money, Kamasutra (ayy)
Yeah, I had to have it, had it with me like I'm Brad Pitt
I'm tryna get it the fastest and make sure my family don't work for shit
Young nigga growed up, Grammy's when I roll up
Hunnids on hunnids, wallet can't even hold 'em
When you the underdog, you gotta show 'em
You know I'm ballin', baby, like DeRozan
20 missed calls, I'm busy at the moment
Niggas was hatin' on us, turnin' bogus
I never let her interrupt my focus
I had to get it nigga so unnoticed

[Chorus]
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
Young, young nigga done growed up (growed up)
