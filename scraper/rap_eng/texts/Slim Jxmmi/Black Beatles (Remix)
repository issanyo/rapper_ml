[Intro]
This gon' be your favorite song
It's Easy

[Hook]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release cash, watch it fall slowly, yeah
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1]
Gettin' so cold, I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' black Beatle
Cream seats in the regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses
Like the scene spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club
Let her party on the table
Screamin' everybody famous
Like clockwork I blow it up
And some more
Get you somebody that can do both, yeah
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me
I think she trollin'

[Hook]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release cash, watch it fall slowly, yeah
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Bridge]
This is gonna be your favorite song
I know, all over again
This is gonna be your favorite song
You know, all over again
This is gonna be your favorite song
I know, all over again

[Hook]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release cash, watch it fall slowly, yeah
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Outro]
This gon' be, baby, this gon' be, your favorite song
This gon' be, baby, this gon' be, all over again
This gon' be, baby, this gon' be
This gon' be, baby, this gon' be, this gon' be your fav

It's Easy
'Cause I'm your baby
You know I'm your man
Can't nobody do it better
Can't nobody do it better
Can't nobody get you wetter
Who else got that shit together
Like me, like me, like me?
Who got the boys in the squad like me?
Like me, yeah
Who else can live and they bad
Like me, like me?
Yeah, who work a pen and a pad
Like me, like me?
