She be tellin' me "baby boy don't steal"
I ain't listen to her cause I still steal
One snap in, I put some racks in my grill
No weapons allowed, I brought my strap in here still

I got dressed, left the crib, set the trend
If you ask me, it all spends
I'm from the mud and my cup needs a cleanse (let's cleanse)
I can't even cruise because I got a spoiler
Hit the store, buy the store, let's not loiter (loiter)
Hit the club, need a drink, need a skank (I got it)
The club promoter said "Swae Lee you off of the chain"
