[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Ooh, brrr

[Bridge]
Kept me 'round with the same team (same team)
And we all got the same dream (same dream)
Diamonds whipped like ice cream
Hit it hard, make a girl scream
Young nigga livin' a dream (dream)
Young nigga livin' a dream (dream)
Feel like Belly 'cause I'm gettin' cream (100 bands for a kilo, nigga)
Cash rules motherfuckin' everything (everything)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, me and you ain't the same, we in a different lane (we in a different lane)
Yuh, uh, uh, you a fool for even tryna compete with me
Uh, shit I'm doin' you would think it was make believe (for real)
Ayy, hit her once, late night, then I made her leave (I made her leave)
Ayy, don't forget your purse, girl, don't forget your keys
Uh, I'm so high right now, I look Japanese
Ayy, if you ain't speakin' facts, I don't wanna converse
'Cause, uh

[Chorus]
You know that God come first
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first (let's pray)
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first (yeah)
You know that God come first
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first (what you sayin')
You know my family come first
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first

[Bridge]
Kept me 'round with the same team (same team)
And we all got the same dream (same dream)
Diamonds whipped like ice cream
Hit it hard, make a girl scream (uh)
Young nigga livin' a dream (livin')
Young nigga livin' a dream
Feel like Belly 'cause I'm gettin' cream
Cash rules motherfuckin' everything

[Verse 2]
Yeah, told the jeweler
All my pieces gotta be flooded
Young nigga gotta come correct (woo)
Young, but I got my hoes in check
Yeah, homie I'm an A-lister
I don't really worry 'bout niggas (nope)
Fuck a trend, I'ma start a movement
On the rise, nigga, on the wave
Y'all better get used to it (better)
Park the Bentley, I'm showin' off (woo)
Drop the top just to show it off (yeah)
My people with me, we don't toast with y'all
Mob stuff, we in overhaul
Everything I'm doin' it's for the team
All I need a little Henny and weed (woo)
That's gon' put me where I need to be
And I need these hatin' ass niggas to keep
My name out they mouth (keep my name out they mouth)
I ain't got no time to argue with you, man, I got this money to count
We don't politic with these clowns, we straight out that Mississippi mud
These hoes tryna see me right now, I'm sorry, baby, that's a dub

[Chorus]
You know that God come first
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first (let's pray)
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first (yeah)
You know that God come first
You know my family come first (they do)
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first (what you sayin')
You know my family come first
You know my squad come first
You know the money come first
You know that God come first
(Woo, woo)
