[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Caught shawty in the rover, she said she a smoker
But the girl ain't a roller, shawty colder than a cola
She don't even want me, cause she want my nigga Bola
All she wanna do is fuck and smoke my doja
Ain't that some shit? I'm lovin' that chick
She a die hard fan of that dick, she want a pic
Stretched out in the front, stretched out in the back
Stretched out my pocket, stretched out my sack

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
When the beat drop 'pon the river
Uncle Jim, I'm a real lady killer
Throw it back, make me feel like a winner
Throw it back, make me feel like a winner
I been eyeing you for a minute (hey)
Girl you bad and you handle your business
Ass fat, tights barely can fit you
Went to college, coulda been a stripper
(But she ain't a stripper)
Thinking 'bout the money when she doin' yoga keep her motivated (keep her motivated)
She ain't outchea chasin' niggas, lookin' crazy, that shit overrated (that shit overrated)
Light the blunt, yeah, we getting faded
Ease your mind, let me relax you baby
Know the world can be intimidating
I know the world can be intimidating, hey

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Say come a little closer
Sure wouldn't mind getting to know ya
Ain't no push-over
Can I come put the mack on ya?
Fourteen hundred, I'll pull over
Fendi, pull over
Panties drop when I roll one
New chick, I'mma stunt on my old one
Two feet, seven hundred on both of 'em
Two girls, I'm cummin' on both of 'em
