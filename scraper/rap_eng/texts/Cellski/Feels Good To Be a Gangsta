[Verse 1]
[Mr. Cee]
Back on the track is a mack and not a mack murderer
You told me your name but I think I never heard of ya
‘Cause it’s so hard for me to understand
Why niggas try to do anything they can just to be the man
Trying to be known as the baller of the town
You better calm your down ‘fore you wind up getting found
In the alley ‘cause this dead body’s getting cold
With an Eddie Bauer shirt and designer bullet hole
And oh, niggas who be talkin’ about me
Staring up that jealousy, pumped off that Hennessy
Better realize when it rains, boy, it pours
I know I got my nine, but nigga, do you got yours?

[Black C]
It’s the wiggy-wiggy-one and to the two and, two into the one
It’s the nigga Black C, and I had to grab my gun
And it’s, all over a ho
Who been going back giving info to another ho
She said they comin’ kinda crazy
You can’t fade me, that’s why right now you packs a .380
Pop pop pop pop, watch another nigga drop
You fuck around with me and I gots to close down shop
It’s Black C, the disrespecter, ho wrecker
You don’t like it? Nigga, just check the
Game that I spit, it’s too sick, it’s some shit you can’t fuck with
You stuck with, so don’t cross Chris
‘Cause if you ever tried to cross me
I think I’d choke that ass and beat that ass like Rodney
King, as I bing, bing
You know a nigga done with crazy, and straight went Sing Sing

[Chorus]
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters

[Verse 2]
[Black C]
This is going out to the real G’s
On the crack block, niggas smokin’ dank weed
With a crack sack, nigga, in my nutsack
Fuck the po-po’s, nigga, ‘cause it’s like that
Should I just creep around the block and kill another muthafucka?
‘Cause another muthafucka wanna kill us muthafuckas
For what? Holdin’ our stripes down
And giving the beatdowns to them other crews because they ain’t from our town
I’m leaving an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
What would be the name of the nigga that broke up the gang truce?
I think that be the nigga named Black
With the black gat and the black hat in the backpack, yeah
And I’ll be comin’ around the other side of the mountain
And the Bay is where your body’s found in
For tryna fuck with a criminal, but you don’t hear me though
So check out the next flow

[Mr. Cee]
In 1994, I guess every nigga keeps a mirror in his pocket
‘Cause they always muggin’ and they need to stop it
But then again, what the fuck?
‘Cause I’ma smile in your face and still switch up in a rush
I better hush, ‘cause real gangstas never talk
And fake ones like blackboards is getting chalk
And this is out to you infiltrators
‘Cause when the shit gets hot, you get soft like some Now and Laters
Talkin’ about we in the same gang
But I can’t hang, with them niggas talkin’ ying-yang
And I’m not no joke or no prankster
So if you see me smilin’, punk, it’s because…

[Chorus]
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I can’t fuck wit’ you muthafuckin’ pranksters
(You niggas marks…)
