Verse 1:
We rollin' five cars deep, all on gold thangs:
A Cutty, a Caddy, two OJ's and a drop Mustang
My nigga's fucked in the Cutty gettin' donuts, fishtail
And smokin' up the block and "Two hun'ed block" is what he yellin'
Hyped as fuck, gone of the Hen and dank
Bitches all over the place, jockin' niggas off gold Daytons
6-7 'Lark is what I'm rollin' when it's sunny
Fo' figured, five block to keep my shit runnin'
Gold thangs, spin in pearl pains, shinin'
And everywhere I go, niggas ask if they can buy in
Bitches jock everywhere I go
That's why I roll solo at the sideshows
Creepin', peepin' out these hoes
Cuz the first one to look is the first to get chose
So come take a ride and let me show you how it's done
Up in the state of Cali-funk-ia
Nigga

(chorus x2)
Roll, roll, roll yo' voges up and down the street
All the niggas drop the tops and hit the spot, if you're ridin' on gold
D's

Verse 2:
Sippin' on some hindu, blowin' on some indo
Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
Chrome
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain't ne'er be mine
Hungarian P.R., now I'ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin'
Job
It's funk in the town of the fog
Too many deaths, ain't nobody down for the squad
Rollin' plushed out exact like your Cadillac
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin' tracks from Vice
Can't wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight
You know them San Franpsycho clubs
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a Glocks
And then a bunch of unknown damn thugs
Niggas poppin' the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus', Caddy paint wit drops what's out, pushin' a
Bump
Y'knaw't's how we do it in the town and I was cold
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut'n nice, it's like life, I'm livin' off in my village
Slangin' that 'caine, get regular cash back, a nigga's spillin'
Ready and willin' for some freaks to leap off in these streets
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin' around with one of these ammos
Under they belts
More niggas I'm killin' than killed, then I be up on tilt
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas
Mug, that's when I'm slug-killed, still makin' these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin' I'll think it him and dark kill
It was a thrill, comin' up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf
A young nigga that's showin' off, ready steady pushin' that work
Pushin' a Caddy on Originals and Voges
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud'fuck's

(chorus till fade)
