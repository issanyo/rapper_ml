[Chorus: Casual Sample]
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff

[Verse 1]
[Mr. Cee]
I’m still tryna survive in the ghetto
And keep myself from getting wrapped up in some yellow
Tape as I skiddy-skirt up and down my hood
Always staying strapped ‘cause niggas’ll jack you if they could
But my nigga keeps the Glock to put Jack in his box
To skin that nigga alive, it’s like he was a fuckin’ fox
I thought when I started rappin’, all that fake shit would cease
But instead of saying “peace,” shit, they always want a piece
Of my muthafuckin’ dividends, but Cee is never giving in
You try to play me, punk, Chevy truck is what you sittin’ in
So can you hear the sound? Fool, you better take a listen
‘Cause just like lost and found, you’s about to come up missin’

[Black C]
‘Cause it’s the kind of beat that the West Coast bump
That real ass shit that kick back and keep the blunt lit
It ain’t nothin’ but a thang to me
And all these player haters know it’s plain to see
That Black C ain't’ stoppin’ ‘til he’s fetti
And I’ll be ready when my bank account is steady
Checking a few ends, checking a few notes, you know
Checking a few dice, and learn a few rolls
It ain’t gon’ ever be enough knowing what you know
So pop the top of the Henn, and let the dank smoke
While you choke, don’t revoke, the sound, but now…

[Chorus: Casual Sample]
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff

[Verse 2]
[Black C]
This the sound of the shit that keeps me lit
Keeps me going, that smooth ass shit that keep a nigga mack and flowin’
So A, B, you see me
Loungin’ in the cuts with four niggas in a bucket, so fuck it
If the po-po’s wanna harass, jack a nigga, or gaff’ a nigga
Others we be smokin’ in the drug zone
So I’ll be packin’ my deuce-five chrome when I leave home
I’m not alone, I’m with three niggas from the ‘jects
And I’ll bet, the bass’ll hit you like a TEC
Nine, when on the grind
You always tryna get yours when I’ll be tryna get mine

[Mr. Cee]
Sit that butt down, just like a couch
And zip that weak ass shit up like a pouch
‘Cause just like a square, we blockin’ bammer niggas out
Oh, don’t you hear my lyrics comin’ out your fuckin’ mouth?
Just call me a tool ‘cause I saw in the crowd
Screaming “RBL” like a ho hella loud
I smoke hella dank and I might hit the bidi
Girls on my dick if I was a baby on my weenie
‘Cause we be kickin’ shit just like some Nikes
Fresh like some Jordans always comin’ hella tight
And you don’t never ever wanna turn our shit down
‘Cause hella muthafuckas have been waiting for the sound

[Chorus: Casual Sample]
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
Boom, that’s the sound from the stuff that we puff
