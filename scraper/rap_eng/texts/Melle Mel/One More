Hate makers
Crack music

Sending out an all points bulletin-
Biggest nigga I've ever seen headed to Las Vegas
He's armed and extremely dangerous
Last seen in a black Benz playing rap music

(Chorus)

Guess I got one more road to follow
Guess I got one more pill to swallow
Guess I got one more silver dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
Guess I got one more nigga to choke out
Guess I got one more hole to poke out
Guess I got one more stolen dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider

(Verse One)

The gun show shit on tracks like a hobo, nigga
Nice with the crew, even the dough low, nigga
Awe man, you just a homo, nigga
Bring a bitch back like I'm Bolo, nigga
Screwed your whole industry
Use my own imagery
Who? My own history
Ooh, she wanna get with me
Young broad, she hung George
She done sure
? The run talk got like cunt tore ?
Come one all I need is one more shot at a hendo
And I'm going in, yo
She came with ? titties and endo ?
Hitting shit
She dripping like a faucet
And she gonna thank the sperm bank for making a deposit
One more diamond is stable
One more baby daddy jaw wired up like cable
Maybe once I had one flaw
But never more
Hardcore, gun whore
Gun store, gun tour

(Chorus)
One more chick in the Phantom
And then I got one more stuck in the mansion
And then I got one more silver dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
I guess I got one more deal to close out
I guess I got one more model to hose out
And she got one more pill to swallow
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider

(Verse Two)

? ...50 and L, my nigga
Ain't nobody fucking with Melle Mel, my nigga
Made Eminem, G, and T.I., nigga
The Klu Klux Clan can't believe I'm a nigga
You'll never be where I've been, motherfucker
Never been to jail, just a gym, motherfucker
Ahead of my time for 20 and motherfucker
Who am I? Where have you been, motherfucker?
My own security personnel in hell
Rest a million skulls
With Melle Mell, stories to tell
I'm the illest nigga you ever saw
And when I send you to hell
Here's a message for the devil
Tell him I send him one more trophy to set
Put your eyes in your shoes
Cause you didn't choose to watch your step
And because you wrote fucked up rhymes
Put your head in your ass
Now you got some hot shit on your mind

The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show

Now when I say click, click
You say bang
Click, click
Bang
Click, click
Bang
When I say click, click
You say bang
Click, click
Bang
Click, click
Bang

(Verse Three)

Muscles got more broad tonight
Smacking rappers cause, God damn
I ran out of sluts to smack
Just one more drop in the bucket
Baby gave me some head
But it was dead
So I ain't all fucking
Got one more mountain to climb
Cause if the ground was mine
Only nigga that could rhyme would rhyme
This rap shit is easy as pie
You niggas high
Your gear is fly but I don't think they made it for guys
Talk about clothes
My dog got more clothes than you
Talk about flow
My broad got more flow than you
Talk about hoes
My hoes got more hoes than you
What about shows?
My cars get more showed than you
Limited edition nigga
While you kissing a nigga
I'm dissing a nigga
And you bitches are pissed at a nigga
All I need is one big score
And you cats can have rap
Gun flow
Back door
Gun show

(Chorus)
One more chick in the Phantom
And then I got one more stuck in the mansion
And then I got one more silver dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
I guess I got one more deal to close out
I guess I got one more model to hose out
And she got one more pill to swallow
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
