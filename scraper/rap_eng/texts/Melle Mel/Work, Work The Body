Yeah, hoo!

Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
(Sing it girls, a-let's sing it, girls)
Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music

Well, I like the way she walks, I like the way she talks
And I even like the way she looks
And when she turns around with those tight jeans on
Oh God, she’s got me hooked!
Check it out! But there's just one thing I want her to know
And that's just what I’m about
I like pretty girls with the tight jeans on
That make me scream and shout. Come on, girls!

Just take your time and work it all night long (huh!)
Just take your time and work it all night long

Well, come a lil' closer and I'm sure you'll find
That I'm a hell of a fella, and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stay for just about an hour
You sweet, fine thing, you'll be in my power
Don't stop the feeling there’s nothing you can do
Put out your bag, take off your suit [?]
Now, if you think that you can’t contain yourself
Put all the silly games right on the shelf!

Just take your time and work it all night long (huh, huh!)
Just take your time and work it all night long

Yo man, look at that girl over there, with them blue jeans on. She look good, right?
Word, man!
Let's get busy, man!

Well, I had a lot of girls in my days
And them girls, they drive me crazy
And all the ways she shakes that precious thing
Oh man, it’s just amazing!
But she's got something else, that I admire
And it's a good head on her shoulders
And Im'ma tell you: she’s fine, and she's all mine
And you can put that in your folder
Huh!

Come on everybody (come on!), work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
(Sing it girls, a-let's sing it, girls)
Come on everybody (come on!), work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
(Shake it up, sha-shake it up, shake it up)

[scratches]

Oh yeah, here we go!

Now, I'm 6'5", sho-nuff alive
Ain't nothin' fake, cause I'm bona-fide
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
So come, take a ride with Kory-O
Now, I ain't got no limousine, I ain't got no credit card
But I got cash-money, and it's yours, honey
If you only do your part, it's yours!

Just take your time and work it all night long
Just take your time and work it all night long

Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
(Huh!)
Come on everybody (come on!), work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music

Come on!
We got the funky music
(Shake it up girl, sha-shake it up girl)
Come on!
We got the funky music

Come on everybody (huh!), work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
([?] in da house)

Just take your time and work it all night long
Just take your time and work it all night long
Just take your time and work it all night long
Just take your time and work it all night long

Well, with the fancy clothes, and your photogenic pose
You can shop as a doll on a stem of a roll [?]
To compete with the beat and the sound so sweet
So lay back babe, cause you can't compete
The way you swerve your curve, it really wrecks my nerves
You're everything that a man deserves
So women of the world made men to be
Because women like you make men like me

Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music

Come on everybody, work work work
Just dance to, we got the funky music
