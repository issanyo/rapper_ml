Life is a Game of Business
And in the end we sight (swear to god)
The new and old are bought and sold
And everybody thinks they’re right

War is a game of business
A game we shouldn’t play (swear to god)
Cause men with guns killed all our sons
They blew us all away

They Called it
World (Paranoina!)
War (it’s Almost Over)
3 (Cause Nobody Hears what the People Say)

Realistcally the Bombs are ready
Technically, Nuclear by name
Capability of total Destruction
Radioactive death and flame
There is talk of a firey doom
Prophesied since the dawn of time
In a world of bloodshed, mass confusion
Killer diseases, Pollution and Crime
Man is in Conflict with nature
And that is why there’s so much sin
Mother nature’s delicate balance will fix it so nobody wins

In World (Catastrofic)
War (Reaganomic)
3 (and nobody hears what the people say)

World (it’s Atomic)
War (catastrofic)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

A thousand miles away from home
A mortally wounded soldier dies
And on the blood stained battlefield
His life flashes before his eyes
Before he dies the man saw jesus
And jesus christ took his hand
And on the soldier’s dying breath
The good lord took him to the promised land

Cause there’s.. No (people living)
More (People Dying)
Pain (Everybody Disappeared)

Breakdown, Pain

1984, See the world at war
Your darkest fears of reality are knockin’ down your door
Drones and mutations, Clones and deviations
And there’s no one that can escape the nuclear revelation

Because

[Hook:]

The silver moon, the midnight stars, jupiter collides with mars
And out of the darkness spirits roar
To cast revenge on the earth once more
The leaders of the world are hypnotized
By wizards, dark and in disguise
Brought to earth by an evil hand
To devour souls in a brand new land
They let the leader think that war brings peace
And out come the one with the mark of the beast
There’s evil behind closed doors
In the year of 1984

[Hook:]

Long ago and all too soon
2 different wars fought on the moon
One put (creators?) on it first
Then we blew futher in the universe
Both of these were nuclear wars
Breaking universal laws
Then falling stars and meteorites
Dropped to earth by day and night
Twisters, earthquakes, hurricanes
Volcanos, drops and torrential rain
Then one day, the UFO’s
Came to see the whole world explode
We will pay the ultimate price
And a lesson is to be learned
When we play with nuclear fire
Everybody’s gonna get burned

[Hook:]

Pain! Pain! (so let the music play on)

Between the boundaries of time and space
Was the planet earth and the human race
A world alive and centuries old
With veins of diamonds, silver and gold
Snow capped mountains over looked the land
And the deep blue sea made love with the sand
Full grown strands of evergreen hair
Kissed the sky with a breath of air
Where exotic fish once swam in the sea
And the eagles soared in the sky so free
But the foolish clan that walked the land
Was the creature, that they called man
They’re cannibalistic, paranoid fools
Tricking each other with games and rules
Training their men to kill and fight
Moving and stearing their mechanized might
Only thought that man had in mind
Was to conquer the world and the rest of mankind
And with the thought that they were right
They gave you permission to take a man’s life
The ones you killed fought just as hard
Then you even had the nerve to pray to god
But god don’t wanna hear all your mess
When you ain’t the one that he laid to rest
The devil’s children with no disgrace
Crushed and killed the human race
While they got rich off the games and war
What in the hell were you fighting for
A silly ass metal, a stupid parade
For all those innocent people you slaid
And after that, you couldn’t even get a job
Cause fighting that war made you a slob
A seargeant and major, a corporal, Lieutenant
Titles and positions were all invented
You, and me, and all this mess
Are just a bunch of pieces in a game of chess
It’s all the same, a third world war
A blood thirsty massacre just like before
It’s genocide, three billion tears
Feeding on a war every twenty years
Then one day we heard the sound
Of the whole damn world tumbling down
Just one big boom, and what do you know
The world is a ghetto, high and low
Crumbling buildings all around
Man’s creation burned to the ground
Chaos, panic, fear and pain
Days of radioactive rain
Grotesque figures burned alive
Miraculously seem to survive
Everything of reality is the science fiction on TV
Mutant dog and sabertoothed rats
Eat men with guns and baseball bats
The dead won’t die, the (rudie?) won’t cry
And everybody’s asking the question “why”
Until swarms of millions walk from the city
And thousands more went underground below
With their head held down in their own pity
Wondering where, they do not know
Cause in this game we had a chance
But we blew it for cheap thrills and romance
Maybe one day we’ll get another play
But until then remember what i say

[Hook:]
