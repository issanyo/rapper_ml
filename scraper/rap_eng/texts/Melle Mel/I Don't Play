(Intro)
Hit me!
Awh, man there he goes again
He's still kicking flavor
That's me, that's right, busy bee!
I wanna toss it off with a little something like this
Imma say it like this
I don't play
You know why?

(Verse 1)
Cause I'm the microphone rocker
Def rhyme sayer
My name is busy bee and I'm a player
I used to go outside with the guys commit the robberies
It was an exercise just like a jog to me
Scheming and leaning on a girl in the hallway
She screamed under the stairs cause we went all the way
If ya'll not dumb I had girls by the dozen but
When I first got some it was from my cousin
May believe she was mean
She was nineteen
She said she see me scheming in a playboy magazine
Her momma caught us slapped us down like dominos
She told her sister and now my cousin, momma knows
We did the hoochie coochie and now I'm dead
Because we was half naked kissing in my mommas bed
She called my pops on the phone
He was mad, I hid his gun away
Cause when pop got home he don't play!

(Interlude)
Word up ya'll!
When he got home I was really scared
He had them old big fat hands and he smacked me upside the head
I wasn't going for that, know what I'm saying?
Word up!
Pop never played and I ain't gonna play with him this time
Cause I'm outta here, word!
Do it pimpy do it!
Guess what ya'll!

(Verse 2)
I'm the player
You know this mic sound odd
I'm not built by mateo but I was made by god
Almighty, as he made it decrease
He said "Thou will have the power to devour on the M I C R O P H O N E"
Thanks to many, plenty
The rest will be your enemies
The rest can be your friends
You see the best is around
You must be serious biz meaning don't mess around
Don't half-step, don't grin, don't smile, don't laugh
Maintain your cool
Never give a fool your autograph, cheat or steal or lie
Don't take a shortcut and then you never use an alibi
Cause your rhymes will be divine
But your on mine, why?
Because your living on my time
So while you're writing your rhymes
Remember when the doctor spanked you on your behind
I looked at the doc and all I had to say is don't fuck with the buz doc
Because I don't play!
I don't play, hit it!

(Short Interlude)
Yeah, I don't play!
I'm gonna continue kicking flavor, alright?

(Verse 3)
I'm cannibal
And I'm not a vegetarian
I eat meat, ha barbarian to rhymes
I'm designed like a sword
And I can break in to take the things that I can't afford
A cash money, gold and even champagne
Five hundread miles per hour in the fast lane
You all know that I'm good to go
I'm like a grand piano, yo, yo you're just a casio
I'm like conan I fear no man
And if you wanna battle go find another man
You're like dead meat don't be facetious
You come in peace or leave in peices
I don't play!

(Short Interlude)
Wooord up!
Here we go ya'll
Guess what, ya'll?

(Verse 4)
I wrote my name on the white house wall
I got a standing ovation in carnegie hall
And when I'm rapping on the mic I give my all and all
Puff and bout to blow up, I'm gonna do it for ya'll
I said from london and france the world rocks with me
Through italy, rome and huh and even germany
And to hawaii they don't understand it
How could the bus rock the whole planet?
I went up to the (?), to the carolina
Shot a game of dice behind the great wall of china
Can do a hundread push-ups, climb and hurdle
But right now I got to do my work
I'm busy bee on the mic and all I have to say is don't mess with the bus
Bus a bus I said huh a don't mess with the bus
A ha a ha a don't mess with the bus
Why, I don't play!
I don't play
Use the echo
I don't play!
Sucka!

(Outro)
Awh man, ayo unique what it look like?
Pimpy over there cooling out
I heard you don't play neither
There go an OG tossing it up
Girls hanging around him and things
He's cooling out
Star child cooling out
Ayo worlds famous, lets go!
