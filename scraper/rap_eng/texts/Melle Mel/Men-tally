[Verse 1: Grandmaster Melle Mel]
When Eve told Adam to try what he'd been told not to try
Adam didn't ask the question why
When the nefruit high
And the sky sent man on a quest for getting high
He blamed the high for seeing what God was seeing
He looked up and recreated at the same time more
In the combine, but the view was mine, split the
Scene.Reality of the 'G' the man didn't have that
Much brains or luck
All he wound up doing was getting fucked up
High off whisky or wine, high off champagne
High off lying & cheating & ill gotten gains, high lust &
Pleasure & pain, smoked dope.then came Cocaine

[Verse 2: Umar Bin Hassan]
Esay little toe, easy little rush
Easy off the illusion to soften the fuzz
Then the soul becomes the outer glee
The moment becomes exciting while begging to be free
Don't worry about it, I've got control
Don't worry about the madness lurking in my soul
So subtle, precise, so focused in goal
Truth becomes pretense, the lie becomes bold
The morning becomes glee, the night satisfaction
The night becomes open to fatal attraction
Pretty little girls and pretty little sides
Pretty little deceptions becomes pretty little highs
The movie, the song,the opening
Scene,the moment sparkled & then they become so
Mean.Slow-dance,fast-dance, fads moving into reverse
The imagination becomes doubtful and then a curse
So casual, so social, so pervasively used
What's good for the gander becomes deadly to the goose.Roses in corners & women in
Bars,so beauty becomes ugly & lost to the stars.Soft
Glances,become hard-core vision, half stopping becomes
Total decision,the beginning,the middle,the end becomes question
Morals are closed but are open to suggestion
Shady position without shaking the trees
Major destruction, in minor degrees
The demons begin to make their call
The power to be strong begins to fall
Slowly the days become indecision
Slowly the days loose inhibition
The seconds becomes minutes
The hours become dreams,& the dreams become insults and then wilting flowers

[Verse 3: Grandmaster Melle Mel]
It starts out as a fad, it makes you glad
The picture is bad because it's something you've never had
It's like a movie
That you only half want.Got you on the come-come for years
& months.From the bath, to the kitchen, ti the bathroom got
You living in the classroom.Stressing yourself,your loosing your mind
Your on the floor looking for something you'll never find,because
You bought your Soul on that very first hit
Now you've got to cook up to get your wit
But you can't find peace no matter how much you get
So all you can get is another hit
You're a monster but wou walk like the dead
Coke is a voice living inside your head
I hope you can dig what I just told ya
Now, the only 'C' I take is Coca Cola, peace

[Verse 4: Umar Bin Hassan]
The rumours keep living your last sense of pride,partially
No-hope,then partally denied,lonely women & fire places
Burning memory into their faces.Empty bottles against the walls
A knock on the door, a sound in the hall, kiss me Lord,kiss me
Now.Tell me me you love me but don't tell me how, you cross
My line but I don't know why,sometimes you're spillin' Happy days
Have come & gone,trapped in the rafter that lingers on
Public insanity in mirrors & smoke, sincerly yours in the
Name of Coke.To shake that shadow,to take that stroll,let
The mind take it's toll.Blind or deaf which way to go?
The conscious degenerate begins to flow,can't see the forest
Can't see the trees,can't feel the change in the coming breeze
An act of reason becomes desperation,an act of rage becomes
Hesitation,God becomes distant & you're so close,the
Sensation becomes easy &then easy goes.Taking advantage
While taking the breaks,almost forgetting what it takes
Caught imbetween the coming back,caught in the moment
Of the coming back.We deal in the self & what to find,the
Positive flame & the stae of mind.Waking up in the morning
To the begining of you,waking up to be sure you can see it through
Why the puzzle,why the quiz,enjoy the moment thats all there is
Heres to the thought,heres to the mind,here's to the moment we
All must find
