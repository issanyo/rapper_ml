When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you're not
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you can give it away
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you're not
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you can give it away

There was a time when i had everything
Fancy cars, mink clothes and diamond rings
I had everything a man could want
Money, friends and women to flaunt
But now that all my money is spent
I can't [?] all my friends and women away

When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you're not
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you can give it away

When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you're not
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you can give it away

When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you're not
When you're hot you're hot, when you're not, you can give it away
