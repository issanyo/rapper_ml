[Verse] (Melle Mel)
Crack, makes you insane
And crack is real wack cause it kills your brain
Creates total destruction to all that's good, your friends, your family and your neighbor hood

(Van Silk)
To cause a young girl to abuse her body

(Melle Mel)
Make a man lose his job cause he loves to party

(Van Silk)
The lady can't sleep cracking all night long

(Melle Mel)
The little baby is going hungry cause the money is gone

(Melle Mel)
So for me and Van Silk

(Van Silk)
And Melle Mel and me

(Melle Mel)
Were gonna help fight crack with W-NBC

(Melle Mel & Van Silk)
So don't do it!..
Don't do it!..
