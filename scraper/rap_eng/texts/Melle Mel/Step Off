Chrous:
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

[Verse 1: Melle Mel]
I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear
See, before my reign, it was the same old same
"To the bop with the bop", that street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is dowwwwwwwwwwn!
(Oohweeoohweeoohweeooooooooooooooooooooooohh
Step, step, step, step, step off.)

[Cowboy]
Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water, my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
Cause anything you wanna do, I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I buy a mansion for my mother
The 24/7, the Kool-Aid smile
Say, "Headcrack eleven and look at my pile."

(Repeat chorus)

[Verse 2: Scorpio]
Come on
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good
Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand
One girl at a time gettin' MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away
You're right
There is no diff' between me and you
Except I look good and you look through
Take that

(Repeat last two lines of chorus)

[Verse 3: Melle Mel]
Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds
But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity, the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the words of the master teacher
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why we're gonna get everything we want
Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense
See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio
Kami Kaze, Clayton Savage and Eazy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop
ROCK!
And not only that

(Repeat first four lines of chorus)

[Verse 4: Melle Mel]
And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the country that was overseas
Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, y'all, all night long
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said
"Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan.", I said
"Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan.", I said
"Let me me rock you cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you, Chaka baby, cause my name is Melle Mel."

(Instrumental break)

[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
Say what, y'all
Say what

To the DJ scratch, you met your match
Cause we're comin' out fresh with a brand new batch
So takin' you off into the galaxy
Is Vicious, Vicious, VICIOUS LEE!

(Cutting and scratching 'till end)
