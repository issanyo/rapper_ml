[Intro]
The ball without the game
The link without the chain
A face without a name
No need to be ashamed

[Verse 1]
So here we are, baby
We both know it's feelin' crazy
I dare you to stop at nothing tonight
Ooh, you're walkin' a tight rope
Why don't you wanna let go
And fall into the sublime?
You got this fear of flyin'
My body's on fire
I think it's about that time, yeah
Let it go into overdrive (come on, baby)
Ooh, don't you wanna taste it
Touch it and stimulate it
'Til I can feel it deep inside?
Don't be so uptight (you know it feels right)

[Chorus]
If your energy explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy, feel me, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on (touch me)

[Interlude]
The ball without the game
The link without the chain
A face without a name
No need to be ashamed

[Verse 2]
It's cool to be shy
But don't let it pass you by
Just give up and let your senses go (go)
Ooh, you know I wanna feel ya
Come here a little nearer
And let the fantasy unfold (you know)

[Chorus]
If your energy explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy, feel me, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on

[Bridge]
It's cool to be shy, baby
Just stimulate me
Don't you wanna touch it?
You know you wanna taste it
Let your senses go
Let the fantasy unfold
Put your hands on, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
If your energy explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy, feel me, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on (put your hands on)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on (put your hands on)
