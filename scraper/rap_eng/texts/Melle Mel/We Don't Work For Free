In the darkness of night, huh!
All the stage lights are shinin' bright, hey!
And we work very hard, to make you stay, rah!
But it ain't no thing y'all
'Cause I know that you can hang
We're not too expensive but you got, to, pay, rah!

Some say the money it's root, of all evil
It's not the love, but lust of it, that makes men greedy, oh
You said, "You wanna go for a ride? You gotta pay the fare"
So stop!  You ain't got no money, you ain't got no beat
Whoooooh, say you
"Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me?"
And I say to you
"Can't you see baby, we don't work for free"

You know you gotta live, but shit, they give you stuff for free
Man, these times are hard, hey!                                                            And don't nothin' come easy-hee-ee, yeah
I just got good news, you wanna come with me?
Hey let's go uptown, I got somethin' you should see
And my friends all say to you, they say
"Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me?"
And I say to you
"Can't you see baby, we don't work for free"

Finance, city life
You gotta work to afford paradise, huh!
But if you livin' in a glass house
Don't throw no stones, rah!
Slave, trade, don't get laid
You gotta get paid, if you wanna go places
Where you've never been before
Ok baby, rah!

Where you been before, don't matter with me
Better save your pennies, nickels, and dimes
'Cause we don't work for free, yeah
I just got good news (from the IRS), you wanna come with me?
C'mon let's go uptown baby, because feel good for free
Hee hee hee, hee, haoowww, we don't work for free
