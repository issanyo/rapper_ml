[Intro]
We have the MAC 10/11
I’ll shoot the MAC 10
We have the AK 47/S
I’ll shoot the MAC 10
We have a twelve gauge skeet shotgun
I’ll shoot the MAC 10
You make it look easy
You will engage ten targets alternately
Please deploy in ninety seconds
You have thirty seconds to load and make ready
Stand by

[Hook]
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
(I’ll show what it does)
(Let’s see that again)

[Pre-Verse 1]
(I’m not ready for that!)
(Ready for this?)

[Verse 1: Grandmaster Melle Mel]
With the MAC 10/11, nobody gets away today
From the spray of the burst of a thirty round
Box magazine is a clean little unit
Only weighs eight pounds and a big ten inches
It’s highly efficient with a rapid rate of fire
Eleven hundred rounds per minute, don’t move
Don’t laugh, it’ll cut you in half
It’s a killer machine, a nine millimeter feed
Nice balance, compact, real easy to conceal
And it sells real well all the way to Argentina
Israel, Yugoslavia, Murder Inc
From New York to Detroit, all the way to the hood
(I’ll shoot the MAC 10)

[Hook]
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10

Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10
(I’ll show what it does)
(Let’s see that again)

[Pre-verse 2]
(That feels better)
(Now feel better?)
(I enjoy it)

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Melle Mel]
On the ass, look at the king, packin a MAC
Hitin’ a fool, but I’m doin’ deadpool, black on black
Can’t shoot, can’t aim with the pain
Novaphene lost your head, now a little kid shot dead
A toy soldier in the army of juvenile drug lords
Sweating young kids like a pedophile
Twelve years old sneaking a MAC in school
Talking about your need for protection, cool baby, real cool
Stickin’ a MAC in the back of an old man takin’
All what they can where they could’ve took my hand
Shot, pop, kids drop heat, need to be seen this
[?] The MAC has turns to his penis
Take it to bed, give a nice gentle caress and back on
Says yes and puts an S upon his chest
Load a clip, now you’re hip, now you’re a man
Don’t flip, stop trippin’ ‘cause your heart is in your hand
(I’ll show what it does)
(Let’s see that again)

[Refrain]
Fuck him down
Fuck him fuck him down
Fuck him down
Fuck him fuck him down
Fuck him down
Fuck him fuck him down
(I’ll shoot the MAC 10)

[Verse 3]
Betcha mind need to use it right here right now
In your old fat tar, better shoot to kill
‘Cause they just passed a treaty, they’ll ban us in the government
They just don’t get there’s a war on here and
Everyone’s for here, let’s go out and get some beers
Shoot some deer or a queer or a [?] or a doe
You know something to do reduce the population
And purify the nation that’s a form of recreation
That’s good clean fun for the whole damn family
(It’s fun)
(I enjoy it)

[Hook]
Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10

Fuck a mother down with my MAC 10
Fuck him up and down with the MAC 10

(Let’s see that again)
