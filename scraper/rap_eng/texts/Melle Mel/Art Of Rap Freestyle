I'm the reason why your man could cuss
And your man could bust, no mistake
That's why you got the game from us
Tell Ja Rule stop popping the clutch
True Fast & Furious
Grandmaster Flash and us
Architects of Hip-Hop domain
And I'm not your man
Spit so much poison that I got ptomaine
So much game, my game came with propane
Mentioning my name is like sniffing the gang of the cocaine
The dopest cat to walk on twos, I never lose
Flows of your amigos, egos battered and bruised
You a lowlife, get off of my penis
Swingin' on balls like you tryin' to call out Serena and Venus
