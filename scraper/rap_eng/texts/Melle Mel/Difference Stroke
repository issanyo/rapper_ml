Aww yeah, you're now listening to the sound of the man that they call Grandmaster Flash, Easy Mike, the Disco B
And I am the man that they call Melle Mel, rock well
Grandmaster Flash behind the wheels of steel, got to be the real deal
More jams than the sea got clams
More [?] than Coney Island got rides
More class than Central Park got grass
Flash, got razzmatazz
Too fly
You don't stop, you don't stop, stop that body rock
'Cause it's on, like popcorn
And the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Like Little Boy Blue blowing his horn
Saturday night, dance marathon
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn
You know it's got to be on
Grandmaster Flash and the Disco B, Easy Mike and I'm the MC
You walk in the place, you listen to the bass
See Melle Mel with a smile on his face
The king on the throne of the microphone
You should know by now, you'll never be alone
When I rap so def, so nice and fresh
You should know by now, I don't settle for less
'Cause I'm on that, coolin' out
You say Melle Mel's bad, without a doubt
I'm down for Flash to make a lot of cash
And say "Come on Flash", 'cause you cut so fast"

You don't stop
Ya, you don't stop
That body rock
Because the beat is gonna be the sure shot
Now you see everybody's hear today at the Celebrity Club
And if you want to get down
If you , if you want to get down to the funky sound
Somebody say ho (ho)
Let's get it on, let's get it on
Come on, get on the floor, freak it some more
Get what you paid that money for
Do what you do best, get it off your chest
You're rockin' with the best and not the rest
Melle Mel, ha, and I rock so well
From the top of the world to the depths of hell
Aw girl, I wanna rock your world
Aw girl, I wanna rock your world
Get funky, get funky
Get funk-funky-funky
I'm not here  to pay nobody's way
I'm hear for you to check out what I say
So before I go, ha, before I quit
You're gonna know I don't pop no Sugarhill shit
I'm Melle Mel, you know I rock well
From the top of the world to the depths of hell
Rockin' with the best with the most finesse
Takin' the top and leavin' what's left
With a face of gold, a heart of stone
I need my crew, but I'm stone to the bone
'Cause I played the games and I paid the price
To be smooth as ice, like paradise
[?]
Figure a chance, I'ma rock you to your knees
I'm coming off all the time
'Cause I'm the undisputed king of the disco rhymes
So help me out, just help me out
Just help me, help me turn it out
Everybody in the place, the bass is in your face
Come in first place in the DJ race
The time that you're hear, it sounds so dear
DJ Flash is so nice and clear
So to let me know that you like the show
Everybody say ho (ho)
You don't, you don't, you don't stop, that body rock
Because the beat is gon', I say the beat is gon'
I say the beat is gonna be the sure shot
Grandmaster Flash, everybody, everybody
Grandmaster Flash, behind the wheels of steel
Say what
You got it Flash
Aw girl

You don't stop, you don't stop, stop that body rock
Now just throw your hands in the air (say what)
And wave 'em like you just don't care (say what)
