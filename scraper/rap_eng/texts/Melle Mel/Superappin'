It was a party night, everybody was breaking
The highs were screaming and the bass was shaking
And it won't be long till everybody knowin' that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going
And, and, and, and
Sha-na-na
Italian, Caucasian, Japanese
Spanish, Indian, Negro, Vi-et-namese
M.C's, disc jockeys
To all the fly kids and the young ladies
Introducing the crew ya got to see to believe
We're one, two, three, four, five M.C's
I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams
And I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I'm Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole playing the role
Dig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Giving you a blast and Sho'nuff class
So to prove to ya all, we're second to none
We're gonna make five M.C's sound like one
Ya gotta dip dip dive, so so socialize
Clean out your ears and then open your eyes
And then pay at the door as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He's a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But he'll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
And from a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure is 3 times 2 is 6
You'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix
We're five M.C's and we're on our own
And we're the most well known, on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that's a fact
And the satisfaction guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an e-m-c-e-e
Is not a threat to society
Say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
If my Mercedes breakdown and dog my grill
I will ahh, drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it on back
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, i'm just too much
I will ahh, shock your mind in a new Star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train

Can't, won't, don't stop, rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down

[Verse 2: Kid Creole]
Ladies who don't know my name
And you fellas who don't know my game
Yes I'm called the prince of soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The M.C delight, young ladies bite
When I'm on the mike, I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
A cool calm customer, the master plan
It takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do and what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say 'all right'
Creole to the broad daylight
Mr. Ness, my mellow, what he look like
With ya on the mike

[Verse 3: Mr. Ness]
Let's a rock y'all, a let's a rock the house
Because the Furious Five are gonna turn it out
So young ladies, if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes, it's true that we got the fuss
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming through rough
We number one ain't nothin' you can do
And if you wanna get down we'll rock you too
So free-formin y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on and let me see 'a rock rock
Cowboy, they say you're from the bronx
So why don't you rock the beat and add a little spunk

[Verse 4: Cowboy]
Yes yes, y'all, ya don't stop
Come on fly girls, I wanna hit the top
I am the c-o-w-b-o-y
Why the man so bad that ya deny
You better watch your woman cause I'll tell you why
Cause I'm Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies' relief
Know as the man of romance and make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance?
I'm Cowboy and I'm shockin the house
Ya say, ya say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
Ah, Melle Mel come on, whatcha got for me?

[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
To the hip hop, a hip hop, a don't stop, don't stop that body rock
Ah, Just get up out your seat and get ready to clap
Because ah, Melle Mel is starting to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold cold cash
With a jockey spinnin for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the the young and old
Wearing big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It's ain't like that yet, but -huh- you'll see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I got a step above the rest
Cause I'm using that ladder they call success
You say 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
A 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 come on Rahiem come and get some

[Verse 6: Rahiem]
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
I'm a one of a kind, the man supreme
I know I'm in all, all the ladies' dreams
I'm the r-a-h and the i-e-m
I put a wiggle in your butt if a tell me when
I'm the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Now gather, mess around i'll take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost/boots
I'm the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don't know my game
Come up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams

[Verse 7: Melle Mel]
And makin' more currency than any M.C
And if the dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel'll be makin' money
Mr. Ness, make makin' money
Rahiem, makin' money
Cowboy , make makin' money
Creole, makin' money
DJ Flash, make makin' money
Hit it

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 8: All]
Take your time and you will agree
That Black Door got good security
So when you walk through the door, just do me a favor
Be sure to be on your best behavior
Young man, what do you wanna do
When the party is through
And a young lady wanna go home with you
You search your pocket, ya soon aware
That you don't have enough for cab fare
Then you say to yourself what a mistake ya' made
Your heart start pumpin' that ol' Kool-Aid
When she walks to you and she starts to say
'Call one-double-o' it's down with o.j
And you pave the way....

[Kid Creole]
Young ladies a like, young ladies galore, young ladies
We do adore
From the way they move and the way they smile
It make's me admire their grace and style
There is not room for disbelief
That's the only way that The Kid Creole can relieve
Or rock the house

[Mr. Ness]
I'm the scorpio and I will not flow
I need 10 fly girls before I go
Now when the night is done
You come and get some
Then you meet Mr. Ness
And you have some fun
Till you walk up real soon
And you head for my place
And when you get in my room
You touch my face and then you start to chase
And then you grab em' by the waist
And then I lay you right back I'm on a steady pace

[Cowboy]
I'm the [?] of the rodeo
Ya' say I ride in the rain till it's time to go
I'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo
All the young ladies roll when he pass through

I got 2 jazzy ladies in deep deep check
Both ladies in the discotheque
I got 1 in the front and 1 behind
I'm in the middle cause they're both mine

[Melle Mel]
Yes yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah that body rock
From the shores of California to the streets of New York
Ain't nothing sweeter than ya walk
Cause thats the way you front
You got hair everywhere, skin so fair
A dynamic personality, a lot of flair
With your flashy clothes and your photogenic pose
You're as sharp as a thorn on the stem of a rose
So petite and elite you're huh, too sweet
So great I'm amazed at your [?]
The way you swerve your curves
It really wrecks my nerves
You're everything that a man deserves
So women of the world {?}
Because women of the world make men like me

Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top

Young ladies out there I won't be surprised
If I catch you watchin' or starin' in my eyes
Come a little closer and you're sure to find that
I'm a helluva fella and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stare for just about a hour
You sweet young thing you'll be in my power
Don't fight the feelin', it's nothin' you could do
Except watch your back HUH 'cause I'm gonna pursue
If you think that you can't contain yourself
Well put all the silly games right up on the shelf
Come here ya sexy figure, tell ya what I'm gonna do
I got a hell of a proposition just for you
Gonna stick the lovin' to ya, baby [?] for a kiss
If you pass the chance up, you know you just missed
Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or anything you can believe
If you so deep in the forest that you can't see the trees
Creole, my mellow
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Kid Creole]
You say I rock the house because the MC's run
Place a bet with this devil, cheated for a hun'
[?] any calm man, with bat or bowl
I go by the name of the Kid Creole
I'm the king of finesse, I'm here to rock the rest
All the young ladies I wanna impress
When I rap on the mic, I guarantee
A certain amount of consistency
Like Flash we'll cut the record to the bone
Creole will rock on the microphone
Mr. Ness, my mellow
Come and get some 'cause we're number one

[Mr. Ness]
Don't stop y'all, let me see ya rock
We gonna rock to the sounds around the clock
We gonna move to the beat but don't you dare stop
Come on everybody, stop playin' around
Because you got to get up so we can get down
Unless you too hot to trot and not ready to rock
Come on and dance give me what you got
'Cause you know by now you got to give me something
'Cause after all you sweeter than honey
Get down on your behalf
Because you gotta do it do for your calfs, Cowboy
They say you from the Bronx
So won'tchu rock and add a little spunk

[Cowboy]
Yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
A come on girl, let's hit the top
Like a .357 pointed towards your head
Cowboy just about ready for the bed
So pull back the covers and take down your pants
'Cause Cowboy will make you Patty Duke dance
A side to side and you pat ya foot
Get up out ya seat then you shake your butt
You say 1, 2, one more is 3
Melle Mel come on, whatchu got for me

[Melle Mel]
You don't stop
That body rock
They say a child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
Your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps, and pushers, they're the big money makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket, peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, "I'm cool," huh, "I'm no fool"
But you'll wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non void
Walkin' around like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, and look what you done did
Got sent up for an eight year bid
Now your manhood is took, you're a big tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Bein' used and abused, served like Hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was large
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad, song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
Say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Rap like Hell will make you sound like Heaven
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Now come on Raheim
A come and get some

[Raheim]
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
And let me see you rock
I'm only five-foot nine, you think I care?
I can pull a girl from anywhere
'Cause I'm bubblin' 'round, just the talk of the town
When they talk about me, they don't dare frown
I'm too hot to trot, to cold to [?]
To all the fly girls, I'm aimin' to talk
To all the fly girls, you got to beware
'Cause Raheim, huh, will be in yo hair
Just come over to the roast, listen to me
Because everybody knows Raheim is what it be
