[Melle Mel]
All the other MCs, step to the rear
’Cause the sounds that you hear, step to your ear
We want it made loud and clear
That the five MCs are definitely here
We got Melle Mel, ’cause I rock so well

[Scorpio]
We got Mr. Ness because I rocks the best

[Rahiem]
And Rahiem, all the ladies' dream

[Cowboy]
Cowboy, I make you jump for joy

[Kid Creole]
And Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole that's playing the role
I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do do a do do a do it
Without that disco fluid
Young lady, rock on
Young lady who don't know my name
You fellas who don't know game
Yes I'm called the Prince of Soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The MC delight, young ladies bite
And when I'm on the mic, I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince of the solid gold
I'm rocking to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
I'm a cool calm customer, the master plan
If you took my hand, you couldn't understand
The things I do, and what I say
Effect a lot of people in the strangest way
Make them clap they hand and say, "Alright!"
It's Creole, to the broad daylight
He's a part of the crew to make you Boogaloo
Mr. Ness, what ya gonna do?

[Scorpio]
It's out, it's on, it's in the street
That Mr. Ness rocks the funky beat
Mr. Ness rocks the funky beat
So everybody, a-what you got for me?
Uh-young ladies, and if you thinking you heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes it's true, we got to give a fuck
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us, and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we come to do rough
We're number one, ain't nothing you can do
And if you wanna get down, we'll rock ya too
So preach for me y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, and let me see ya rock
Cowboy, they say ya from the Bronx
So why don't ya rock the beat and add a lil spunk

[Cowboy]
’Cause I'm the omigo of the rodeo
Ya sit and ride in the rain ’til it's time to go
I'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo
All the buffaloes roam when I pass through
They call me T-O-W-B-O-Y
The man is bad and that you can't deny
You say you better watch your woman
’Cause he'll take your wife
’Cause I'm Cowboy, and I'll give her a drop
You say 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven

[Melle Mel]
To the beat beat beat it sounds so sweet
Just get out your seat and stomp both your feet
Hip-hop have a ball, rock rock ’em all
’Cause the beat beat beat's unique y'all
I said get up out your chair, get ready to clap
’Cause Melle Mel is starting to rap
And ever since I rocked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself, at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold cold cash
With a jock spinning for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the young and old
Wearing bigtime silver and solid gold
My name's on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on a TV screen
It ain't like that yet, but you can see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I gotta step above the rest
’Cause I'm using that ladder they call success
You say one, two, one more and three
Rahiem rocks so viciously

[Rahiem]
I'm the beast from the east, the best from the west
The fourth from the north, the mouth from the south
I'm the man you fret, the women's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
On, bad, like my dad
Said anything I wanted, or could have had
You say the name Rahiem, what does that mean
I'm talking ’bout the one that all the ladies dream
My name brings peace and tranquility
So all the fly ladies' hearts can run free
I'm a grown man, baby, not a boy
You're looking at the man that got the real McCoy
My head's above the water like it's supposed to be
’Cause I sure got a lot of stuff with me
Not Romeo or like Don Juan
Not the man from Flint or, huh, James Bond
Classified as a lover with a certain pizzazz
And you might even call it razzamatazz
Got it like that, and that you can bet
I'm on my way to stardom, but I'm not there yet
I am so fly for the ladies to see
And to the fellas I'm a threat to society
There's nothing y'all can say, nothing y'all can do
And you won't come off until the Five is through

[Melle Mel]
Now if you like the way that we get down

[Furious 5]
Check out how we pass it around

[Melle Mel]
Just dip-dip-dive

[Scorpio]
So-socialize

[Rahiem]
Clean out your ears

[Cowboy]
And then you open your eyes

[Kid Creole]
And then you pay the door as a donation

[Furious 5]
To hear the best sounds in creation

[Melle Mel]
He's a disco dream

[Scorpio]
Of the mean machine

[Rahiem]
And when he cuts the sides

[Cowboy]
You'll see what we mean

[Kid Creole]
His name is not found in the hall of fame

[Furious 5]
But he'll shock and amaze and make you feel shame

[Melle Mel]
Makes a lime from a lemon

[Ness]
From a lemon to a lime

[Cowboy]
He cuts the beat in half the time

[Kid Creole]
And as sure as three, times two is six

[Furious 5]
You say Flash is the king of the - quick mix!

[Melle Mel]
We're five MCs

[Scorpio]
And we wanna be known

[Rahiem]
As the mystified magicians

[Cowboy]
Of the microphone

[Kid Creole]
We throw down hard and we aim to please

[Furious 5]
With finesse to impress all the young ladies

[Melle Mel]
We got rhymes galore

[Scorpio]
And that's a fact

[Rahiem]
And the satisfaction's guaranteed

[Cowboy]
To cause a heart attack

[Kid Creole]
We are the best as you can see

[Furious 5]
So eliminate the possibility

[Melle Mel]
That to be an E-M-C-E-E

[Furious 5]
Is not a threat to society

[Kid Creole]
The boss talker, the [??] walker
The woman teaser, the crowd pleaser
The innovator, not the duplicator
But the rhyme creator, no one is greater
I'm the mic man with the platinum voice
I rock any mic if you give me a choice
I got flair, no question I'm confident
I got rhymes for sale, [??]
If you're on the floor, or in a seat
Rock to the beat I will repeat
Now when you listen to this beat, you must be told
I'm the dedicated prince called the Kid Creole
Creole, playing the role
The Kid Creole, is solid gold
Mr. Ness, come and get some!
My mellow, because we're number one!

[Scorpio]
Beat beat y'all, you don't stop
Come on come on, and let me see you rock
Scorpios'll rock the house
Those scorpios'll rock shock the house, you see
’Cause I'm a scorpio, and I will not blow
’Cause I need [??] before I go
When the night is done, you come and get some
And then you meet Mr. Ness and you have some fun
You walk up real soon and then you head for my place
When you get in my room, you touch my face
And then you start to taste and then I grab you by the waist
And then I lay a rap back I'm on steady pace
Cowboy, my mellow
They say you're from the Bronx, so you rock the spot

[Cowboy]
Like a .357 pointed towards your head
’Cause Keith Cowboy just about ready for the bed
So pull back your covers and take off your pants
’Cause Cowboy'll make you [??]
Side to side, then you pat your foot
You get up out your seat, then you shake your butt
Say 1, 2, 3, and 4
Melle Mel, come on, a-what you waiting for?

[Melle Mel]
From the shores of Japan to the promised land
They call me Melle Mel, ’cause I'm
The [??] walker, the native New Yorker
With big time clientele, you see
I'm the cool-out prince, been rocking ever since
I got down with DJ Flash
More flair, debonair, than savoir-faire
Yeah, I got a lot of class, ’cause I'm
The most talked-about freelance MC
To ever walk in the Bronx
When I get to the top, I'm gonna rock the spot
And make all them look like chumps
I'll be hip-hop chief rocker, making more cold cash
Than an MC could ever make
I'm gonna burn so bad, they think they had
Burned with shake and bake, so let me tell you
Say 1, 2, one more, and three
Rahiem, my man, rock viciously

[Rahiem]
Said my name is Rahiem
As you all well know
The hypnotizing voice that dance to disco
I'ma captivate this, saturate it
The non-sophisticated
The bell ringing, the morning singing
Earth-quaking, the disco shaking
Heart-breaking, money-making
The humdinger, the baby bringer
The man with the terrible middle finger
Never to miss the sounds

[Furious 5]
That goes like this!

[Rahiem]
Creole, bang, rock the house
Pow, come on
Help me turn it out

[Kid Creole]
Mr. Ness, bang, rock the house
Pow, come on
Help me turn it out

[Scorpio]
Cowboy, bang, rock the house
Pow, come on
And help me turn it out

[Cowboy]
Melle Mel, bang, rock the house
Pow, come on
And help me turn it out

[Melle Mel]
Rahiem, bang, rock the house
Pow, come on
Help me turn it out

[Rahiem]
Say step by step, stride by stride
And all the fly young ladies would like to ride
In my Mercedes

[Furious 5]
Young ladies!

[Rahiem]
In my Mercedes

[Furious 5]
Young ladies!

[Rahiem]
If my Mercedes break down and dull my grill

[Furious 5]
Well I drive up in my new Seville

[Rahiem]
If my Seville break down, I take it all back
Well I...

[Furious 5]
Dull my grill in a new Cadillac

[Rahiem]
My Cadillac break down, just too much
Well I

[Furious 5]
Shock your mind in a new Stutz Stutz

[Rahiem]
If my Stutz break down, I make another choice
Well I

[Furious 5]
I dull my grill in my new Rolls Royce

[Rahiem]
If my Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
Then forget it

[Furious 5]
Forget it
Forget it
Forget it
Forget it
Uh!
Then take the train

[Kid Creole]
Too hot to handle, I'll play the role
I go by the name of the Kid Creole

[Scorpio]
I'm Mr. Ness, and I rock the best
Because I rock it to the beat with the most finesse

[Melle Mel]
I'm Melle Mel, and I rock so well
From the top of the world to the depths of hell

[Cowboy]
I'm the C-O-W-B-O-Y
You seen a man so bad that you can't deny

[Rahiem]
When you wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know you been possessed by the voice of...Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Come on, come on, come on
I wanna see you rock
To the beat and [??]
To the beat and [??], I said
To the beat and [??]
Young ladies...
