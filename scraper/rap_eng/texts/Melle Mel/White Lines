[Intro]
White! Ooh-white! White! Ooh-white![2x]
(White Lines)
Vision dreams of passion
(Going through my mind)
And all the while I think of you
(Pipeline)
A very strange reaction
(Yours to unwind)
The more I see, the more I do

[Verse 1]
Something of a phenomenon
Telling your body to come along
Cause White Lines blow away
Blow! Rock! Blow!
Ticket to ride a white-line highway
Tell all your friends they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound it costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

[Chorus]
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Aaaaah...
Higher baby, get higher baby, get higher baby
And don't ever come down... Free base!

[Verse 2]
Pipeline (pure as the driven snow)
Connected to my mind
(and now I'm having fun, baby!)
Highrise (it's getting kind of low)
Cause it makes you feel so nice
(I need some one on one, baby!)
Tell me it'll blow your mind away (baby)
Going to your little hideaway
Cause white lines (what do white lines do?)
Blow away
Blow! - Rock! - Blow!
A million magic crystals painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked baby
It's nobody else's fault - so don't do it!

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
(Don't you get too high)
Don't you get too high, baby
(It turns you on)
You really turn me on and on
(Can't you ever come down)
My temperature is rising
('Til the thrill is gone)
No, I don't want you to go
A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now
Just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with twenty four kilos
He's out on bail, and out of jail
And that's the way it goes!

[Bridge]
Cane! Sugar! Cane! Sugar! Cane!

[Verse 4]
Athletes reject it - governors correct it
Gangsters, punks, and smugglers are
Thoroughly respected
The money gets divided - the women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke
It's hard as hell to fight it - don't buy it!

[Chorus]
