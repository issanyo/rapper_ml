Are you ready?
Oooh, c'mon!

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh?
Out of sight, out of mind (yeah right)
Once again back its the incredible
Sublimial the infredible D
Once down in the dirt
Now I ain't even gotta shave when I'm goin to work uh
A'ight, looks like im drinkin tonight
Tomorrow i'll be sippin' on some pedialite (c'mon)

Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)
Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh?
Chit chatter, that shit don't matter
Check the flow, I organically grow
Like the weed I for sheezy, be letting ya know
Ooh... yeah, kinda feelin' horny
Who that is? What it say? What it look like?
"20 eyes in my head" misfit
And i ain't never gonna change. (c'mon)

Chorus:
Don't think you know what the hell i'm all about
(phenomenon, something like a phenomenon)
Don't think you got my shit all figured out
(phenomenon, something like a phenomenon)

I'm a make ya bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like this
Bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like, somethin' like this

OK chaps... let's take it from the top, go

All you hollywood rockstars
Hollywood ass, wishin' you had big cash
Rollin' like your pimpin' but ain't really got shit goin'
'cuz you ain't limpin' like the bizkit
You're just sittin' on the sidelines
You just fake kid, if there's a title then i'll take it
Whoo-yah hit ya with the boo-yah...
And I ain't fuckin' playin' around

Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)
Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)

Chorus

I'm a make ya bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like this
Bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like this...

What would you do, if this was the end of the world?
(Tell me, what would you do?)
What would you do, if this was the end of the world?
(Tell me, what would you do?)
What would you do, if this was the end (the end) of the world?
(Tell me, what would you do?)
What would you do, if this was the end (the end) of it all?

Want me tell you what i'd do? C'mon!

I'd turn it on up (oh yeah?)
And i'd shut it on up (oh yeah?)
And i'd bring that beat back (oh yeah?)
A'ight then bring it on back, go!
Yeah! Bring that beat back!
Say what?

I'm a make ya bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like this
Bounce-ba-bounce, ma-ma-ma-move-ma-move
Ba-ba-ba-break you off a little somethin' like this

Uhh, uhh, it's Limp Bizkit, baby!
