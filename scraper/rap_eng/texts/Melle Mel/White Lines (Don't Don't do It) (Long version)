Freeze! Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock!
(High... High... High... High...) Rrrrrrrrruh!
Bass!
(Oooh White...White) [x3]

[Verse One:]
(Ooooh...White Lines) Vision dreams of passion
(Blowin through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(Pipe cries) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see the more I do
(Something like a phenomenon) Baby
(Tellin your body to come along, but white lines...blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

Ticket to ride white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound costs more than gold
The longer you stay the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothin to gain except killin your brain

(Freeze! Rock!) [x4]
(Blow!)

(High...) Higher, baby
(High...) Get higher, baby!
(High...) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

[Verse Two:]
Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Orang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

(Pipe line...) Pure as the driven snow
(Connected to my mind) And now I'm havin fun, baby!
(Pipe cries) It's gettin kinda low
(Cause it makes you feel so nice) I need some one-on-one, baby
(Don't let it blow your mind away) Baby
(And go into your little hideaway cause white lines...blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

A million magic crystals, painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost over night
Twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked, baby, it's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

(Freeze! Rock!) [x4]
Rrrrah! (Blow!)

(High...) Higher, baby
(High...) Get higher, baby!
(High...) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

[Verse Three:]
(Don't get too high) Don't you get too high, baby
(Turns you on) You really turn me on and on!
(Cause you gotta come down) My temperature is risin
(When the thrill is gone) No, I don't want you to go!

A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
He's out on bail, and out of jail and that's the way it goes, rrrruh!

(Cane!)
(Sugar! Cane!) [x2]

Athletes reject it, governors correct it
Gangsters thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided, the women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke it's hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it!

(Freeze!) Huh-huh huh huh! (Rock!)
(Freeze! Rock!) [x3]
Rrrah! (Blow!)

(High...) Get higher, baby
(High...) Get higher, girl!
(High...) Get higher, baby!
(High...) C'mon! Rrrrrah!!

[Verse Four:]
(White Lines) Vision dreams of passion
(Blowin through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(Pipe cries) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see the more I do

(Something like a phenomenon) Baby
(Tellin your body to come along, but white lines...blow away...)

Little Jack Horner sittin on the corner with no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny but he took his money and sniffed it up his nose!
