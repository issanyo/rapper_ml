[Intro: Melle Mel speaking]
The gun show is officially in the building
Muscles, Scorp, Rock , Mecca, Brother Lance
And for all the lil’ niggas that thought about it

[Hook]
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t)

[Verse 1: Melle Mel]
Broken dreams, over the triple beam
Go for the cream, niggas sellin’ dope to the fiends
Young juvenile killers, jeans and white tees
Saying “freeze,” nobody can hear you scream

Little girl with a boy in the carriage left in the projects
Was meant to marinate in the madness
Trapped in a tragic apparatus, uneducated and black
With a lack of any marital status

Shorties listening to 50 Cent CD
Know it deeper than they ABC’s, believing they can be OG’s
Most of them were conceived in the back of a Jag’ or a SUV

Unless you be a athlete or a rap star
You’ll master the art of realizing how black you are
Coulda swore that my broad was a normal chick
Rented a video – the hoe was in a porno flick

[Hook]
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t)

Can’t nobody can take my shine, can’t nobody break my stride
(Don’t) Can’t nobody slow me down, you didn’t know me then
How the hell you know me now?

[Verse 2]
I want to smack you ‘cause you talk too much
Little shorty killed his moms for her last two bucks
If you keep bangin’ on the glass I’ma blast you punk
Your point is hollow, dog, you might be hard to swallow
But you suck

What? Life’s a bitch? Talk about her, admit that
If you can’t fuck with her, you can’t fuck without her
But I don’t like the neighbors, and I wish I could find out
Who’s always pissing in the elevator

Caught in the crosshairs of the cops and crooks
The jooks kids fall between the cracks and nooks
I go to jail and it’s not a good look
Martha Stewart went to jail, she got a show
She’s writing a book

[Spoken interlude: Melle Mel & (secondary voice)]
Writing the hook, I’m thinking a song called “Everybody, Let’s Party”
(Nah dog, that ain’t strong)
How about “Unity?”
(That ain’t hip)
How about “Bitches ain’t Shit?”
(Now that there is a motherfucking hit, dog)

[Hook: Melle Mel]
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t)

Can’t nobody can take my shine, can’t nobody break my stride
(Don’t) Can’t nobody slow me down, you didn’t know me then
How the hell you know me now?

[Verse 3]
Don’t act like you know so much
You ain’t cute enough to prostitute
Don’t try to ho so much
Don’t ride around like the rest of your boys
‘Cause them niggas is on stage making a bunch of goddamn noise
Don’t be so wild and loose, Don’t fall for the half-truths
‘Cause it might be child abuse

Pro-black ball player: Yo man, don’t marry a white woman
Go on and give your sister a chance
Don’t be afraid of the word “nigga”
Be a strong, rich, proud, well-educated nigga
Don’t ever turn your back on your people
Don’t ever get so rich that they think you equal

You think selling dope is the shit?
Don’t buy a 5X white tee without buying one that fits
Don’t think that every platinum cut is a hit
And if he tell you he love you, that don’t mean to sit on his dick

Don’t think that you gotta belong
Don’t think that it’s right if you know that the shit is wrong
Don’t let them niggas string you along
Don’t think he a gangsta, he just rhyming on a goddamn song
Don’t look for a place in Hell, trying to make that sale
You might as well break in jail
Don’t take your shirt off around Melle Mel
Don’t look, don’t blink, don’t mess around

[Outro]
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t) la la, la la la
(Don’t)
