[Chorus]
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control

[Verse 1]
AMG is the owner of the big D
Down with the 304 Posse
I put it in the girl and the head ‘til it’s straight
‘Cause I go way past eight
Just like Bob, girl, I wanna rock witcha
Then my dick’s gonna getcha
I don’t joke when I talk about pokin’
I’m Too Tall ‘cause I ain’t from Oakland
And I like ‘em in all kinda tones
From Chocolate Thai to redbone
And like I said, I house ‘em from the attic to the basement
For my dick, no replacement
‘Cause pussy is my best friend
In and out and out and in
The soul in hole is a game that you play with the soul pole
But you need dick control

[Chorus]
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control

[Verse 2]
Short dick brothas, don’t get too mad
I’ll call you son, you call me dad
‘Cause hoes these days don’t play that shit
They want good dick and you lick
But I’m one nigga that’ll do both
You gotta be a clean hoe, use soap
And if you feel like I feel, be for real
And if I don’t make you cum, who will?
Bitch, I like hoes with no clothes
Big fat butts and a face full of nut
And a tight pussy with a kung-fu grip
Bitch, I’m a journey not a trip
And if you think that you can hang
Suck this dick then pass me a hot wing
‘Cause it gets better as the pussy gets wetter
But when you get tossed, use sauce

[Chorus]
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control

[Interlude]
Yo Trace, break it down…
Short dicks, long dicks
Weak dicks, strong dicks
Keep it in control, my brothers
(G, break it down for me)

[Verse 3]
Call me a motherfucker with game
I rock hoes outta clothes and run trains
I got long dick for the hoes, so keep smilin’
From Long Beach to Long Island
Peace

[Chorus]
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control
Dick control, dick control, you gotta have dick control

[Outro over Chorus]
Trace has dick control, Kev has dick control
G has dick control, Moe Doe has dick control
Court has dick control, Greedy Greg has dick control
Quik has dick control, Hi-C has dick control
KK has dick control, D has dick control
If you ain’t got it…peace
