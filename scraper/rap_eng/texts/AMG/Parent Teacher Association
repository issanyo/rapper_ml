[Verse 1: Speech]
Long way come, one day we living in bondage
Burn Js on sunday need munchies we hungray
Bombay on the table, use the kane if able
Telling them a fable, labeling a cradle
Of a Rebel with a metal medal
In the meadow where the level creek
Creek!
Stepping on the medication
The weed is moving around, rotation
The hidden location, I need a floatation device
Respiration for the reputation
Resonated resolution revolution
Limitations at the risk of sounding like an imitation of a speech
Ill intentions of a thief, fell in a ditch
Shawty got me nutting for my birthday so I told the shawty i appreciate
Money got me stunting, wasn't ready for the money but the more we vitiate
The more we need to pop a couple bottles in the club, thats how we recreate
Never had to pay rent, teach her ass a lesson, associating with P.T.A

[Verse 2: Speech]
When recession reach them, we just dey get richer
Pulling something out of nothing, magician
You should know the wait is over, I've never been sober, my pocket is over, weight
Cooking on the stove, I hope I don't go back to overdosing to a coma (hey)
Stories bout the seed they planted
First it gets grounded in the fucking planet
For the stamina to stand against any animal or weather that it could be handed (hey)
Then a nigga start to germi-nate
No one showed me how to navi-gate
Other niggas saping off me so I need to cut 'em off, not only lace-rate
We no be mate, that na why we no relate
I eat the pussy like it's sushi or fish fillet
They show me love, never thought I'd miss the hate
Then I reasoned thats the reason I invisionate

We don owe dem, they owi, oya meet your maker

[Verse 3: Speech]
Riddle me this
Riddle me this, how could a riddle belittle a nickle is Nicholas cage
Ma necklaces stuck on me neck and ma chest is where all my pendulum sit
Literally they hated on me cause my head was so big and I was the..... littlest kid
Need to resist, the drugs is appealing I need to desist
Pay in advance, all that you owe me for gettin the cash
What ama do in a bank, making a transfer no ama stay in a trance
Know that I gave a em a chance, the weight of my bands, is weighing my pants down
I am the best hands down
I am the best hands down
