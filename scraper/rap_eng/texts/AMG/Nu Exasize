[Intro]
“What color panties she got on?”
“Gotdamn!”
“What you mean?”
“She ain’t got on none”

[Verse 1: AMG]
1, 2, 3, 4, and touch the toes
And after that, yo, anything goes
AMG and I wanna make a statement
I housed the freak from the attic to the basement
Hoes, without no clothes
Butt booty naked and I’m good to go
In a bed, in a car, in a [?] and Jacuzzi
Sippin’ on a wine cooler, freakin’ at the Snooty
Girls got a wait problem—they can’t wait to bone
A nigga on the microphone
So a brother like G’s gonna get you in shape
You got the oven, and I’ve got the steak
You don’t need pills or a Slim Fast milkshake
I’ll make you sweat like you’re running a race
So open up your legs and close your eyes
‘Cause I got a new exercise, bitch

[Chorus]
Some people call me at night
I’m only out for the ride
So if a hoe like you get with a nigga like me
Pretty soon, girl, you’re gonna get fine
Just bend your ass on over
And lay my muthafuckin’ dick on ya
And I do it doggystyle and all the while you’re gonna know
I got a nu exasize

[Verse 2]
Yo, I teach class seven days a week
AM to PM, a natural freak
You see, I stay so slim ‘cause I don’t be jokin’
Show me the booty and I’ll be strokin’
You might wanna warm up first
Yo, like pulling those dollars bills out your purse
And I’ll rock the booty like a smoked out crack fiend
Lose that tummy, you know what I mean?
I got a two-for-one special, lower pack level
Aerobics ain’t shit to a dick like mine
And wait until the jumping jacks jump off
You didn’t know Jack can do that
Back, back, back, and up and up
Pass me the Gatorade, I’m tired as fuck
I’ll take it round for round, and pound for pound
AMG, I push up for the kick down

[Chorus]
Some people call me at night
I’m only out for the ride
So if a hoe like you get with a nigga like me
Pretty soon, girl, you’re gonna get fine
Just bend your ass on over
And lay my muthafuckin’ dick on ya
And I do it doggystyle and all the while you’re gonna know
I got a nu exasize

[Verse 3]
Me and Mrs. Jones had a little thing going on
She was older, though, but she wanted to bone
She didn’t look bad to be such an old chick
She grabbed my dick, ooh, that was it
I had to work that big ol’ grandma ass
Gray hair on her coochie, titties that sag
I mean, really, she tried to fuck me to death
Ben-Gay on her body, Tums on her breath
I said, “Oh no, yo,” she wouldn’t let go
Big ass strong hoe—what you doin’? Yo
I grabbed a barbell and a jump rope
Knocked out the senior citizen with one stroke
It musta got too damn good
Old ass hoe with a young ass niggaro
G workin’ over these hoes like a burger and fries
Doin’ that exercise

[Chorus]
Some people call me at night
I’m only out for the ride
So if a hoe like you get with a nigga like me
Pretty soon, girl, you’re gonna get fine
Just bend your ass on over
And lay my muthafuckin’ dick on ya
And I do it doggystyle and all the while you’re gonna know
I got a nu exasize

[Outro]
Peace, I’m outta here
Yo, peace to D…ah, I got a nu exasize, hey
Peace to Dick Gregory, peace to Jenny Craig, peace to Jack LaLanne…
