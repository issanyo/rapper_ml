[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Yes I'm too smart to get dicked, or so the case may be
That's how the ho felt when she found out that she couldn't play me
I know the game and I know it rather swell, too
Rubbin' up on my dick and givin' me hints that you interested
Thinkin' first you'll kiss my lips, you'll rub my hips and you'll take a sip
Of Hennessy, hit the hooter, pass out and I'll take the strip
Hell nah, monkey mouth trick, ya stupid hoe
You must be a fool if you thinkin' that I don't know
But nah, you broke ass hoes be wantin' to come up, shakin' that money maker
But I'll break her, cuz the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just don't know the formula, of how to get rich quick
Without makin' happy dick
That's all the bitch know, is how to be a mega-hoe
I guess it just goes to show that she's to ignorant to know
That I won't be played, or ganked or gaffled, but I ain't perfect
I whip the dick out now and then and let 'em slurp it
But I'm careful, bein' aware of the bitches
That's torchin' niggas on purpose 'cause they think they deserve it
Yeah that's some cold shit, my experince oughta learn ya
That if a nigga ain't tryna smoke ya a bitch tryna burn ya, so

[Chorus: DJ Quik, scratched samples]
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Lemme hear it

[Verse 2: Playa Hamm]
I refuse to lose so I choose few and trust none
See my ladies I love, but to these bitches I ain't the one
When I tell you to trust no bitch, it might not occur to you
Females ain't the only bitches that I'm referring to
See you can't help a bitch, let alone treat swell a bitch
'Cause a bitch sold out, gon' sell out, or the bitch gon' snitch
Bitches wanna be and gon' always go be around
Watching what you do and tryna use you and keep you down
Playa Hamm ain't gon' bore you with a story, you got your own
I'm a strengthen your conviction to give that dog a bone
And move on, 'fore the motherfucker fake you, fuck you
And make you take they punk bitch-ass to the bank, fool
See bitches gets paid, these bitches got charm
I see em all at the mall, on TV, and on my homies arms
Yeah, some of my homies got bitches, but we breakin' bitches, homie
So I come like this bitch, act like you know me

[Chorus: DJ Quik, scratched samples]
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Eazy-E, the mothafuckin' manipulator
When it comes to pussy holes, just watch how my dick grows
But since all hoes fall in the bitch category
Trustin' no hooker-ass bitch is mandatory
How much do you you want bitch? How much can you take?
'Cause a nigga like the E you can't break
Put that skinny little ass in my face and I'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before I tap it
My left hand's on your ass, my right hand's on your head
'Cause bitches get the nut and niggas get the lead
Suckin' my dick, lickin' my balls, make me come faster
Suckin' my toes, lickin' my ass, you know you are the master
Now you just won't stop
Suckin' everybody's dick 'cause it's good till the last drop
But that shit won't phase me
I trust no car wreckin' bitches, this one's for you, Tracy
Yeah, you biiitch!

[Chorus: DJ Quik, scratched samples]
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes

[Verse 4: AMG]
Pussy ain't nothin' but a hole in the nine-deuce
I'd rather make a mil' while I'm sippin' a cold brew
Bitches ain't shit, word to the diggy-diggy-dick
Eazy-E, P-P-C, AMG & Quik
Bitch I ain't Babyface so save your whip appeal
I never go on dates with broke bitches, that's free meals
I'm supposed to pay the way to lucrative panty deals?
Bitch please, you better hit the knees
Or you can even touch your toes
'Cause I'm still playin' ya'll punk hoes like dominoes
And if you suck the dick right and the pussy's tight
I might not beat you down until the second night
Once a dog, always a dog, bitch
You little trick-tramp slut with the big butt
'Cause you ain't shit, bitch
I'd rather fuck you than love you
Bitch I never trust ya

[Chorus: DJ Quik, scratched samples]
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes
Trust no bitch
Punk bitches
Trust no hoe
Funky cock hoes

[Outro: DJ Quik, (Eazy-E,) scratched samples]
Hell mothafuckin' yeah
This is one for all them triflin'-ass, no-good, riff-raff
Crab-scratchin', once-a-month-bleedin'
No-douchin', disguistin' bitches
You know you you're gettin this one from DJ Quik
My nigga Eazy-mothafuckin'-E (Let's double up on them hoes)
AMG is definitely in the house
And the P-P-C is sendin' this to you

[Hook: DJ Quik, Scratched samples]
That bitch Cindy is a mothafuckin' funky cock hoe
And Misha is a no good funky cock hoe
That bitch Fada is a no good funky cock hoe
And Robin is a triflin'-ass hoe
Dana is a funky funky cock hoe
You know Vida is a triflin'-ass funky cock hoe
And Marcy's a disgusting funky cock hoe
And Karen is a funky ass funky cock hoe
Eazy said Tracy is a no good funky cock hoe
He said April is a triflin'-ass funky cock hoe

[Outro: Eazy-E]
And like I said before
All bitches ain't shit
