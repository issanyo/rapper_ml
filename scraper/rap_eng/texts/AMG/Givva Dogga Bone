[Intro]
All the hoes in the say “me” if you’re down with AMG
All the niggas in the house say “ho” ‘cause, yo, here we go

[Verse 1]
Shazam, the G is who I am
I like girls with long hair and big derrieres
Some people try to label me a nut, but hey
You are what you bust
‘Cause every time I see a freak I think I wanna freak her
Like every time I see a mic, I’m looking for the speaker
But that’s another story to tell
And right about now I got records to sell
And bitches wanna give me the pussy like it ain’t nothin’
And I’ll be huffin’ and puffin’ while I’m steady stuffin’
Dick into their mouth, into their coochie or their anus
Niggas are dogs—hey, can you play with us?
And after I fuck, yo, I don’t know ya
Respect you not as soon as the panties drop
‘Cause you ain’t really nothin’ to me
A bitch, but you gave me pussy for free
So give a dog a bone

[Chorus]
Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

[Verse 2]
Part two, back in the day I got dumber
Fuckin’ number leavin’ with a fake phone number
‘Cause that’s how a nigga was livin’ like
Treat ‘em like they wanna be treated? Yeah, right
‘Cause a bitch’ll run you over in a minute
Get your ass sprung on a pussy and now you did it
Now you’re doing everything for the hoe
While she out fuckin’ another niggaro
But G ain’t even for that bullshit
You better hit of the shit you was fuckin’ with
‘Cause you ain’t even coming for roni
Niggas are niggas and hoes are hoeing
Like I said on my last song, my dick is long
And I can slang my muthafuckin’ thang like cocaine
And if you ever ever ask on my name
Save up your money ‘cause you got strung
So givva dogga bone

[Chorus]
Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

[Interlude over Chorus]
We got Boss in the house, we got DJ Quik in the house
We got Second II None in the house, we got…

[Verse 3]
Bitches and hoes are like new clothes
Yo, once your sport ‘em, you wish you ever bought ‘em
But I play hoes like a banjo, I fuck ‘em and I fuck ‘em
You say a little something while I’m nuttin’ on they belly button
Just to think, if a bitch had a dick
She would probably try to fuck a nigga and jet quick
Just like a nigga would do
Hoes ain’t true, and niggas, that’s you, too
But the bitches are talkin’ the most
Niggas ain’t shit—well, you’re kinda close
Just remember, the next time you’re getting fucked
You think the nigga’s in love? Well, don’t press your luck
Because pussy ain’t nothin’ but a hole
And most bitches ain’t nothin’ but hoes
Don’t forget that fact when you’re laying on your back
Bitch, and remember to moan when you give a dog a bone

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

[Outro over Chorus]
Bitch, for the ’91 and ’92, AMG is in the muthafuckin’ house
Giving dick to the hoes as prince grows
Peace
