[Refrain:]
I go hard like Vladimir Putin
Go hard like Vladimir Putin
I go hard like Vladimir Putin
Go hard like Vladimir Putin
I go hard like Vladimir Putin
Go hard like Vladimir Putin
I go hard like Vladimir Putin
Go hard like Vladimir Putin
Vladimir Putin – 4 times

[1 verse:]
Niggas don’t know what I put in
Instead they be out here hating
That dem bwoy dem now dem a run ting
Coz I go hard like Vladimir Putin

I’m talking that talk and I’m walking that walk
Nigga got green like incredible hulk
You talking that talk but not walking the walk
Like a Muslim outchea eating that pork

Looking at ma Audemars
Now it’s time to turn up here
Put in work like Vladimir
Yeah I’m the hardset here

[Refrain.]

[2 verse:]
Ok then, let the maniac spit then!
These motherf***ers puppets like sesame
I see them, I seize them

I don’t want to take em to Guantanamo bay
Torcher bitch Nigga should have stayed in your f***in lane

Get money I’m bossed up
Hit the club I turn up
Nigga talk shit get f***ed up
Goons in your face you messed up, Ahhh!

[Refrain.]
