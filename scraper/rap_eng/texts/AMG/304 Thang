[Chorus:]
It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

[AMG:]
Pagenet Nationwide on my side
Never miss a beep from a freak with a big behind
Who wanna bump and grind with the bigga nigga?
I need a hooker who's quick to lick a dicka
Take a sip of liquor, Hennessy and Dom PÃ©rignon
Gettin' high with the bone
Lookin' for the late night hype
Player haters huggin' on they hoes so tight
Trick of the Month, trickin' on a stunt
Thinkin' you's the mack 'cause your pockets on fat
I'm the reel-to-reel, got the steel to deal
And, put my fist to your grill and will (damn!)
Take your hoe to the honeycomb hideout
Give her this mighty love, then I slide out
I'm the wham-bam thank ya m'am king of the underground swing
Baby it's a 304 thing

[Chorus:]
It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

[AMG:]
I'm just a nigga from the motherfuckin' what?
Used to make ends with the birds and the bud
Before I made a demo, before I rode a limo
They used to call me Spend, paper to the pen
Beats to the tape, sittin' in the studio
Niggas try to act it, but they never knew me though
Just me and mo' doe, never in a four-do'
He me low keyin', Cherokee'n
Now it's '94 and, A-M' is the name
Fuckin' up the game, steppin' on the lames
Niggas wanna gangbang but I wanna make ends
Fuck a '6-4 put me in a Benz
With a redbone bad mamma jamma
With the thumps and the bump like my nigga Hammer
And it's real good, comin' with the California feel good slang
Cause nigga it's a 304 thing

[Chorus:]
It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

[AMG:]
Nigga who is you? Guess ya don't know about my crew
Will put you in a twist and they don't miss
Too many to name, but they don't want fame
Just a piece of the game
And some wanna get high but I gets fly
From the Coast with the most to the best thigh
And I can't forget Chicago and Frisco
Houston where the Geto Boys is thick yo
Atlanta, GA where the players play now
One more gen for my niggas that locked down
And all the rap superstars and they crews
You better get yours, before they get you
And to the ladies, I don't hate ya but I love ya
But a few of y'all, oh yes I'm through with y'all
So if ya like what ya hear let me here ya say HO!
Cause baby it's a 304 thing

[Chorus:]
It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing
