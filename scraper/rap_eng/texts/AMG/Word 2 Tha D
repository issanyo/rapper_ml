[AMG]
(D)
Ahhh yeah
Once a-motherfucking-gain y'all
AMG in control
(Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money)

[Verse 1]
AMG, on the go, in motherfucking stereo
I dont smoke cocaine, I smoke Buddha
Do anything for a motherfucking soda
Ignite it, not get excited, let me hit it, and I'm wit' it
Pass me the motherfucking microphone
Before I mack to the bitch with the tight ass Guess on
Bitch, I'm down with the DEA, a nigga with an attitude, an a AK
So you wanna dance to this gangsta swing
Cause it ain't no thing for me to con ya ass
Cause ya fucking with a teenage pimp, ho, I put you on the strip
Working your motherfucking fingers down to the bone
Bitch, daddy's home

[Chorus]
Word to the D y'all, word to the motherfucking D y'all
Word to the D y'all, word to the motherfucking D
Word to the D y'all, word to the motherfucking D y'all
Word to the D (Life ain't nothing but bitches and money)

[Verse 2]
I got a shotgun, for a nigga like you
A punk motherfucker with a punk motherfucking crew
Saying my jams ain't hittin'
You must be bullshittin, look at the pull im gettin
Well I'm making my money legally and illegally
Sucker motherfuckers can't get with me
But wait until the tape drops
And watch all the stupid ass hoes jock
They wanna ride this dick like a motherfucking cowboy (Yee-haw)
But I ain't down boy
Cause a bitch ain't nothin but a bitch to me
Word to the motherfucking D

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I shoot motherfuckers to get my kicks
Super Socco and gin, to get me bent
And a thick ass bitch to get me laid
And a smoked out fiend to get me paid
AMG, coming like a motherfucking nut
Hoes with the big butts, I bust big guts
Pussy, sit it on my dick and I'll be fucking it
Always there's a smile on my face cuz I be loving it
I do damage to a redbone, a light skin freak will get my bed on
And I play thess hoes like a trumpet, bend 'em over, bump it
And see I'm leaving ya, cause thats how the game goes
Up comes your clothes, I'll pull pull out the rubber hose
And stick it your mouth its kinda funny
(Life ain't nothin but bitches and money)

Word to the D y'all, word to the motherfucking D y'all
Word to the D y'all (We hear ya motherfucker) word to the motherfucking D
(AMG, DJ Quik)
Word to the D y'all (2nd II None) word to the motherfucking D y'all (Hi-C)
Word to the D
(Life ain't nothing but bitches and money)

[AMG]
It ain't nothin but a butt
It ain't nothin but a big nut
It ain't nothin but some dollars
It ain't nothin but a forty

Uhh, yeah, ahh shit, hey, well
Word to the D, word to the D, word to the D, word to the D
Word to the motherfucking D, y'all
Now word to the D, word
Word to me bitch
