[Intro]
Uh…where’s my keys? Ayo, where’s my keys?
Ayo, I.C., yo, you ready to roll?

[Verse 1]
Rollin’ in my Cutlass on Vogues
I watch a sexy girl as she strolls, and yo
I don’t know her, and she don’t know me
But in a few minutes, I’ma get the booty
‘Cause in my car I got the helluva sounds
And when they hear it, I know their panties are coming down
Down down down to their pretty little toes
Come a little closer, I wanna get to know you better
Like last Sunday I rode the ‘shaw
With my nigga Hi-C, or better yet Crawf’
Hoes was all over the place and
Niggas racin’, and big beats bassin’
And being the nigga I am, you know I had to scam
To get a little wham-bam-thank you ma’am
Ayo, fuck them all, I had to show the hoe what I mean
Then she turned into a backseat queen

[Chorus]
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Backseat Queens…

[Verse 2]
Slide that seat all the way back
Stick out your booty and open up your crack
‘Cause I don’t choke when it comes to pokin’
Yo, I’ll leave all the damn doors open
‘Cause if things tend to get outta hand
I’ll put you on the hood and be damn good
AMG, GMA, gangsta mack, ain’t it
I whipped out my dick and all the girls fainted
One by one, two by two
And those who didn’t fall—come on, y’all
Would you like something to eat?
Come on down, let me feel the beat
‘Cause that’s how I’m livin’ like
Those who don’t wanna bone, you want me take ya home?
Yeah, bitch (Yeah, hoe, sike)
‘Cause you’ll be one walkin’ muthafucka
On a late night stroll like a Compton clucker
And I ain’t even goin’ out like that
You better quit frontin’ and jump in the back, ‘cause…

[Chorus]
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(G rocks the backseat queen)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Backseat Queens…

[Verse 3]
And while I’m getting the best of the opposite sex
Hey, I like the play all the dope tapes
Eeny-meeny-miney-mo, let me pick a good one
Break out the stick and dip it in the pudding
Honey colored girls with big butts
Ooh, you make my tongue go nuts
And if you’re good to go, to me, that’s a plus
Yo, dick to coochie, and nuts to bust
‘Cause I’m a young nigga (I got a lotta energy)
Pull down your panties (so I can be your friend indeed)
And like Quik said (Girl, I got that feeling)
Don’t be shy (put your feets on the ceiling)
And get into the good old missionary
I bump the coochies, bald or hairy
And eat ‘em on up like a hoe cake
I can’t wait until I get that first taste
But back back back to the gold seat
To make a hoe come within an oldie
And if I do, I can be the newfound king
Getting busy with a gangsta lean on a backseat queen

[Chorus]
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(G rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Get in your cars and vroom…)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(I rock the backseat queens, yo, 304 rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Yo, DJ Quik rocks the backseat queens, yo, Second II None rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(Hi-C rocks the backseat queens, Moe Doe rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Trace and Court rocks the backseat queens, and Greedy Greg rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz

[Outro]
Yo, so jump in your rides, uh, roll down the ‘shaw
And get a freak with a big ass, yo…
