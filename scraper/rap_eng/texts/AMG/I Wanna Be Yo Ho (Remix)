[Chorus]
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho

[Verse 1]
Make room for the bedroom king, the lick ‘em low lover
Undercover, I’ll lick toes to the nose
I’m looking for a stone cold freak with a physique
AMG from way back, the daddy mack
A bang bang boogie to the holster hoes
I hump and I jump from coast to coast
I got a new exercise
So open up your mouth and close your eyes
(My, my, my) You alright, B?
(My, my, my) Just don’t bite me
I’m looking for a new Janine, to be the fiend
About 19 with a whole lotta green and
(Baby, I’m a dog from around the way
So listen up close ‘cause I got to say that…)
That I’m just a freak for you
So tell your man I got a treat for you
‘Cause he’s a goner, ‘cause girl I wanna…

[Chorus]
Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho

[Verse 2]
I’ma lick it where you want me stick it, so baby kick it
Keith couldn’t Sweat this hard ‘cause I’m a wicked
Brotha in the bed, so baby, throw your legs up
High in the sky and pray I’m gonna let up
Big butt freaks, in hotel suites
I bust ‘em out and I throw ‘em away, yay yay
But not you, dear, you got the best booty of the year
Have no fear, I’m diving in with the gear
And they don’t call me A-M for nothing, to the break of dawn
Baby, I’ll be huffin’ and puffin’, steady stuffin’
You full of me and me full of you and
Turn around, I know what I’m doing while I’m pursuing
That big fat tail, did it so hard I shoulda went to jail
Daddy did a good job, girl, kinda swell
So let me in the skins, what the hell
(Hey) And baby, don’t yell, I wanna…

[Chorus]
Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho

[Bridge]
Moe Doe…
And it goes a little something like…
And it goes a little something like…
And it goes a little something like…
And it goes a little something like…
And a little like this…and a little like that…
Here we go, here we, here we, here we go

[Verse 3]
Since you the trick and I’m the vic (hey)
I play the hoe ‘til you get sore, and yo
(Put in your booty and your mouth)
And baby, your big fat booty just drives me crazy
So have a trick and a smile, Compton style, freak
I'll see you in the swap meet
And when you see your name on my tape, don’t claim it was rape
‘Cause you know the booty was great, I wanna

[Chorus]
Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
(I wanna be yo) Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
Be yo ho, be yo ho
