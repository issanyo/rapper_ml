[DJ Quik: Verse 1]

Aw yeah, check this out
The Quikster's here, yo Spin let me state this
With the hype and the style that I make this
Groove so hot that you would think that I baked this
This is a steak, I'm a tiger; try and take this
I come off strong with the strength of a dozer
You have no game with your girl 'cause I chose her
I grabbed her hand; I took her backstage with me
We tore it off my friend, now she's yours again
I'm like the Big Bad Wolf on the microphone
So if your girl's Little Red you better take her home
And hide her, before I try to ease on up
To push up on the butt
'Cause a brother like the Quik is chilling with a feeling
For a fly female because I'm able and willing
To tell her the things that make her hot like a cup of tea
After the show she'll be looking for me to tear it off

[Hook]

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (C'mon! Cmon!)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Word)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo, yo Spin)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo drop it)

[AMG: Verse 2]
Getting busy on dope, could swear up and down then I sold it
Girls on the tip so I hold it
A masterpiece, and a piece I'mma get
From the get-go, I'm gonna go 'til the mic sweat
And heaven knows, anything goes
With those that dispose no Gucci at our hoes
For the AMG, and while you're playing me
I'mma flex the hip hop sex and then I'll be
Nice and smooth and mellow, a hell of a fellow
[???] example
You can't get with this, I'mma hit with this
Do that dance in my ring while you swing to this
And you thought I was only a pimp, how you figure though
I'll make it good to your girl 'cause a niggaro
Is givin you something with heart and not soft
Yeah, tear it off

[Hook]

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Aw Yeah)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Yo baby)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (DJ Quik and Spin)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (And we in here you know it)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (We got Trace on the board)
(Yo Trace, drop that shit)

[DJ Quik: Verse 3]

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
Money, Quik cuts, The Source with a house to 'ford
And I'll bet the set will be in E-F-F-E-C-T
I'll be arranged to change so I can clock Gs
On stage the world the girls the date, but I ain't fazed
I play the role and I get praise
Freak and the funk and yo, watch a brother hustle right
On the road with rhythm and chorus, mic
'Cause what I'm sayin, "There ain't no brother like me"
To step into the AM 'cause the AM be the G
And girlies on the tip, but they really on the D
And Quik is on the mix, but if he ain't he on a freak
Take it off baby, 'cause today you're gettin done
You never let me see you swim, but let me see you come
So I can make it good to you
You know I wanna do you (word!)
Tear it off

[Hook]
