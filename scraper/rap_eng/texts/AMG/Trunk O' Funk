[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Can you feel it, baby?
Smoothed out

[Chorus]
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)

[Verse 1]
Call me the new hoe on the block
Some do like me, some do not
I get paid to lay all kinds of ways
Smoothed out fade with knack for hoe rap
And some said flowin’ to me, was not you
Nigga hoes just went deep for ‘92
AMG almost gold for ‘91
And when I kidnap rap shows, I pack gun
Yes, me, sea to sea, coast to coast
William Mo’ takes care of my dough
I roll Benzos, truck for the snow
Sippin’ something cool like a Bacardi Breezer
And then jim gets greeted by a skeezer…
But anyway, when I grab M-I-C
C-O-O-L A-S I-C-E
Oh, I guess not, no, in or out
Fast, not slow, and smooth not rugged, so
I’m kinda like sex
MC’s receive broke necks when I mic check
And peace to the DJ’s
I ran rhyme marathons for three days
Kinda like tongue relays for the Lick ‘Em Low Lovers
Word to the D, brothers

[Chorus]
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Now, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Now tell me can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)

[Verse 2]
Since our last meeting, I’ve been eating
Bombudd cookies, made by Cookie
You see, my mind got escalated by something I love or hate it
But then…I just did it again
304 supplies the tool
Moe Doe will check in hand, he’s the band
Beats by the ounce, dozen, and pound, rhyme for rhyme
Verb for verb, noun for noun
I’m like down for a big fat butt
Pretty lips and hips, and a fat sack of
What is that, Dr. Lovejoint smokes herb? (Mary Jane)
Uh, have you kicked to the curb
So lay back and hit it ‘til ya cain’t
And if you got a bitch wit’ ya, fuck her ‘til she faint
‘Cause your dick ain’t got a brain, punk
So when you’re finished fuckin’, throw her in the trunk
I’m outta here

[Chorus]
(Trunk o’ funk)
Now tell me, now can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Yo, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Yo, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Tell me, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Come on, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)

[Outro]
Shouts out going to the nigga hoes, Moe Doe, Chubb Rock

Ha ha, I’m outta here
