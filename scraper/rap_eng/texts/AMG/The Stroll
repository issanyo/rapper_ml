[Verse 1: AMG]
She want a million dollars
Bet she can get it with a million swallows
Dig deep until it's hollow
Sheâ€™s a knees and neck hoe
Cheese and check hoe
Skeet on the twice
She want to be the wife
She want to live the life
She want to know my real name
Know the real A
She don't want to play
She want the rings, she want the dress
Nothing less for her
She want the best
And she deserve it, yeah
I like the lines and teardrops
Fights and name calling
Checking my e-mails
Hoping I stop balling
Bitches they keep coming
And so I keep coming
She hating everything about me
But love something
I love the girl really
But love is so silly
One day is safe forever
The next she want to kill me
I just keep my composure
Never thinking it's over
If not, I just jump in the Rover and roll

[Hook: sample]

[Verse 2: MED]
Yo, she the baddest
Flash match kicks with fabrics (on caffeine)
Pat-patty cake, the fatty (got it badly)
Addict of backs, back traffic pass half speed
Stripping for magic, moved out of Cali, uh
First dib, now the city's his
Mack skins, never tally, tryin' to counter in
Miss Valley fit thick like home mix, perform tricks
Dove tips swarm like Sandy when the storm hit
All hunnit's, nothing she need from 'em, but punishment
Lovin while leaving the Benz running
Crush us, lips, she been stuntin'
Snitch says something to sniff, but knows nothing
In her walls like soles in flow runners, summer nights
Swinging the wood like Jim Duggan
She still thuggin' in
We lovin' it
Miss Butter never knew her by her government (?)

[Hook: sample]

[Verse 3: Blu]
Yeah, uh
Yeah, word up, you getting green
Spread it for that ass and spazz
Cause it's ya birthday
Throw it back to dad and crash
You got paper
Spend it like a bottom and swallow
Cause all day
All day you finna be sleepy hollow
Headless, yup
Make she can't call you back
(Why is that?) Why is that?
Cause she lives in my lap (like that?)
Make it slap and clap
Like a track with a hoe on it
Make dough on it, and throw it back
Hold it back, shit gets far from over
We've been drinking all day
And I'm far from sober
I thought I told ya
The mac need a poster
The lac with that ass to match
Call me owner
Like I own her, like you sold up
Like a soldier though
I bust for what
So keep your toe up
Tales and no females
And if you tell the story
Please, leave out the details
