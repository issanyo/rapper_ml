[Intro]
Compton in the house
2-2-0

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
(Up in da club)
Where you chillin' for the summer, homie?
(Up in da club)
Jumpin' out the stretch Hummer runnin'
(Up in da club)
Fly ladies from wall to wall
(Up in da club)
With my beats I'm fadin' all-a y'all
(Up in da club)
Can a playa spend his double life
(Up in da club)
Before she shank me with a butter knife
(Up in da club)
Upper level or a lower life
(Up in da club)
Still the same be where we go inside

[Verse 1: Gangsta D]
If You lookin' for a man with a bulge in his pants
And really ain't trippin' about a one night stand
I'll be that dude that'll leave you wishin
That's floatin' in ya love pond, strictly fishin'
See baby lookin' cute with her bathing suit
Pinstripe, all in her ass without the zoot
I'm Gangsta, baby, don't you know we keep the heaters hot
Summertime, when we grind bumpin' on your block
In the club smokin' trees, drinkin' Hennessy
Crack a straggla to the fullest is my strategy
Ain't no need for actin' uptight with Gangsta D
Now put your drinks in the air and make a toast to me
'Cause I'm off the red eye flight
Flyin overseas for the ladies with the tight
Tell me what you like
Fast or slow? In my car on dubs?
A straight fuckin' while we buckin', baby

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
(Up in da club)
Where you chillin' for the summer, homie?
(Up in da club)
Jumpin' out the stretch Hummer runnin'
(Up in da club)
Fly ladies from wall to wall
(Up in da club)
With my beats I'm fadin' all-a y'all
(Up in da club)
Can a playa spend his double life
(Up in da club)
Before she shank me with a butter knife
(Up in da club)
Upper level or a lower life
(Up in da club)
Still the same be where we go inside

[Verse 2: K.K.]
Now K.K. got a space at the back of the club, low key
I did my thang in the car, that's why I skip past the bar
Got my eyes on tight, I'm headed straight for a corner
Got my eyes on this freak with 10 suckas all up on her
The type that claim their fly and fresh
Yappin like hoes bout who got the best Rolex, sweat
Drenchin' all on my head and my shirt
It's time to shake my buzz, grab a skirt and go to work
Crack the dance floor wit' me but don't hurt yourself
Nights in the summertime at the club (oh yeah)
The tricks come to spend a lot
On these tricks off the knot
That's why they get with pockets ripped to they socks
Damn! These pretty hoes comin' in flocks
Talkin' 'bout how many freaks I got
That's why I go sometimes for a minute then I shake the spot
It's either too damn crowded or hella hot

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
(Up in da club)
Where you chillin' for the summer, homie?
(Up in da club)
Jumpin' out the stretch Hummer runnin'
(Up in da club)
Fly ladies from wall to wall
(Up in da club)
With my beats I'm fadin' all-a y'all
(Up in da club)
Can a playa spend his double life
(Up in da club)
Before she shank me with a butter knife
(Up in da club)
Upper level or a lower life
(Up in da club)
Still the same be where we go inside

[Verse 3: AMG]
Yeah, hoe it's Dolce & Gabanna, ya mama
In the six, treble, big face
She wanna know how my hit tastes
Yeah, I remember these freaks by face
Or their dimples or they cheeks to the belly chains on they waist
Most of y'all knees and knuckles with Cartier belt buckles
Lookin' for a nigga that hustle
Shit, I'm the next multi-million dollar black man
For all y'all inquisitive niggas, check the Soundscan
Quik got a beat that'll cost a hundred grand
Party from LA, to Rio to Japan
If you in the sand, throw up both your hands
If you in the hood with the leather and wood
Let these hoes know 2-2-0 got the do-do
Find me on the net, dot com the text
VISA, Mastercard, American Express
Spending, BITCH!

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
