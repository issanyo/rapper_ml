Is hip-hop ready for an entire album talking about "bitches" and "hoes"? Well, AMG has done it. More foulmouthed than a late 70's Richard Pryor concert film, AMG is primed to upset all women who despise the "bitch" tag. While offensive to some, AMG's "Bitch Betta Have My Money" single made much noize and so should this album.

     A product of the Total Trak Production crew that includes DJ Quik, 2nd II None, Hi-C, Sylk Smoov and Boss (a female), AMG is probably the best rhymer of the bunch and he backs himself with some fat tracks (with stoopid bass) to prove it. His song topics are simple -- he talks about bitches; how he likes 'em and what he does with 'em. Bitches, bitches, bitches.

     The tracks range in production style to fit different tastes. "I Wanna Be Yo Ho," "Givva Dogga Bone," and "Tha Botty Up" have a up-tempo funk/club feel for the South. "Once A Dawg," "Jiggable Pie," "Mai Sista Iz A Bitch" (with a fat cameo by Boss), "Nu Exasize" and "Trunk Of Funk" provide the hardcore sounds with familiar samples basslines and breakbeats. "Word 2 Tha D" "Backseat Queens" provide the West Coast-style funk while "D Control" is straight-up hip-house.

     The subject matter gets tiring but some of AMG's production (especially on the hardcore tracks) is undeniably funky and will have heads nodding.
