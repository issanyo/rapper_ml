Yeah.. whassup y'all?
It's a 304 thing baby
Snatchin the hoes and the loot..

Smack it up, flip it, fly honey dip it
I never bone alone, I got a nine in chrome
I used to be out of luck, now when I get a boner
It often means vagina miner get to the moaner
I mean really cause it's silly ? bumps that I broken
I guess you're gettin dumber ? in the summer
I didn't know a rap song could make your jock that long
Where's your mattress, is it strapped off?
I got a girl, now my dick it need a little rest
Can't be a freak, AIDS killin niggas every week
So when I see the booty on a cutie
Got to turn the other cheek
Word to the diggidy diggidy D
So now I got damn groupie on my snoopy
A year ago, now you're up in the butt
Though I didn't know, that I would know, so many is good hoes
By the look that you chose, you're undercover pros
Praise the Lord, bless your soul
In your Gap and your tight clothes and your fake gold
I forgot the hair, gettin paid for your derriere
Shakin it and bakin it, while a nigga steady takin it
For a ride in a Benz or a Beamer
304 have you seen her? Have you seen her?
AM, pump with the trunk of funk
Won't luck fuck for a trunk of stuff
Wouldn't give me the play when I was Jay, now I'm G
She got the okay, she seen my CD (bitch)
And oh how she jocks
Callin in my shit on the Video Jukebox
Baby, I won't say maybe, I just say noooooooo
Don't be a 304

Don't be a 304 (4X)
Don't be a 304
Don't be a 304 (3X)
C'mon baby
What you want my loot and my ducts, and the dingaling?
Don't be a ho

[AMG]
Now for the deuce, fans wanna know who is who
Tres with the bass, mo' go 304 is a groupie
Stompin, AMG ain't from Compton
Better yet Bed-Stuy, N.Y
Some of ladies wanna know why I say bitch
To get rich or to make a point about a trick
A bitch is a woman who sucks and fucks
A dumb nigga for his duc's and bucks
A ho is a girl that'll do the same
With no shame, and less game
And baby, I don't want neither
Bitches or hoes, I keep my shit in my Girbauds
Or wrap it up tight in a jimmy hat
For a red bombudd and a hootie mack
L.A., home of the one night stand
Like playin craps with your dick in your hand, you understand?
So this is for the college and the high school crew
Cause y'all be out fuckin like a zoo
You better quit, before your dick goes
Fuckin with the trick hoes, don't be a 304

Don't be a 304 (4X)
Hell yeah, ya know ya know ya know
Don't be a 304
Don't be a 304 (3X)
Yeah my man, aww yeah
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Don't be a ho
