This is dedicated to the pretty black young women, from AMG...

Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'll spread the jam for the ho-hums
Gimme some baby or maybe
Would you let me smack it up and flip it and run it down, to the bone
Call me when youre momma ain't home
Amg, a 69 king, I lick 'em low
And take my pick like if I had a 'fro
I get a lot of play because I get a lot
And I can get a girly kinda hot when I hit the spot
Supernatural, very irresistible
And if you take a bite, its very nutritional
Its called jiggable pie for the dumb dumbs
You can nibble on it if you want some, my my my

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(My my my)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Ahh baby)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(For you, for you)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie

[AMG]
Crack kills, but not this kind
I try to get ahead when I get behind
I wish I was a pair of panties full grown
So when you put them on, I could be home sweet home
And if you got a weave it dont matter, dump the chitter-chatter
I wanna get it on, you know like give a dog a bone and I'm the K-9
A big black rin-tin-tin with a grin
So let me get a sip of this night train
So we can do the right thing
It be just like redhead, pump it honey
Well let me feel your body, for the jiggable pie

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Go back to the bedroom)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Squeeze the juice)
My my my, my jiggable pie(I got jiggable pies)
My my my, my jiggable pie(All over the nation)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Station to station)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie

[AMG]
Back to the backs, lets get cheek to cheek
I tend to be a big butt freak
But on this level, I'm a chocalate rebel
Hersheys I might squirt when I insert
Skin to skin, boody I'm all in
And you're all that with your feminine fat
Redbones don't fret I ain't done with you yet
I'm tryin to get all that I can get

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
My my my, my jiggable pie(So remember)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(It ain't about the color)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(It's about the lover, peace)
My my my, my jiggable pie(East Bay)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Shouts shouts shouts)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Going out to)

[AMG]
