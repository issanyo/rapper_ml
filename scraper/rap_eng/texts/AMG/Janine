[Intro]
("Dick") Suck it
("Dick") Lick it
("Dick") Put it in your mouth because...and then she...
("She swallowed every inch of it down") of my ("dick")
("She swallowed every inch of it down") hey, and then she ("dick")
("She swallowed every inch of it down") of my ("dick")
("She swallowed every inch of it down") and then she
("She swallowed every inch of it down") of my ("dick")
("She swallowed every inch of it down")

[Verse 1]
Yo, licking my dick is a specialty
To a girl named Janine—oh, what a dick fiend
She likes to suck and suck but no stickin’
Break out my dick, and it’s like finger-lickin’
Of my bone right down to the base of it
She just blows it when I ask her to Stuffit
Down in her throat, and if she choke
That’s her business—nut in her mouth until I’m finished
Yo, ‘cause I came to cum, brush your teeth
Here’s a stick of gum—do you want some?
Hurry up and lick your lips, clean your throat
Pull down the zipper, here we go
Not too hard, not too soft
Brace yourself, yo, ‘cause you might cough
‘Cause my dick ain’t nothin’ nice
And when I’m done, put your lips on ice, ‘cause…

[Chorus]
Janine…("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine…("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")

[Verse 2]
You can ask my main man T-Money
She do the shit free, no money
‘Cause when I got first done by the bitch
I pulled out my dick and her lips started to twitch
Then I thought to myself, ‘I got a live one’
No jive, I had to go and slide some
Some of this big ol’ black beef
In between the teeth of a dirty old cum thief
But she ain’t old, she kinda young
Kinda sprung, on a dick that’s kinda hung
That’s me, the dick holder, the money folder
Last year, I woulda sold you a boulder
But this year it’s all about 12 inches
For the radio and the bitches
And no matter how many records I sell
I still go to the hoe that’ll serve me well, ‘cause…

[Chorus]
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
Janine’s a dick fiend ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
(What is she?)
Janine… ("She swallowed every inch of it down")
(a dick, a dick, a dick fiend)

[Outro]
Ah, and I’m outta here
But before I go I gotta thank
My nigga Greedy Greg, Trace and Court on the boards
My nigga DJ Quik, my homies 2nd II None
My nigga K. Born, my nigga Kev Money, my nigga T-Money
All of the vertical joyriders, know what I’m sayin’
Yeah, yeah, uh…
All the hoes in the house…all the niggas in the house…peace
