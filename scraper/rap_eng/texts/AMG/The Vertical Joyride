[Intro]
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it

[Verse 1]
Uh, oh yes, call it cess, L.A.’s best
Am I next to put smoke in my chest?
But this is the new, improved shit
A big fat Phillie for the ’92 zip
And when I’m rollin’ in my ride kinda high
Females be on my tail because I’m so fly
Eyes are open, checking the scenery
When on Cloud 9, no one can get with me
I can go 10 different places at one time
I can jump in my ear and walk through my mind
Psychedelic P-Funk for the buddha heads
Light it up, little nigga, go ahead
And if you see a big gat, pick it up
Tits draggin’ ass O.G., stick ‘em up
And if you have a vertical joyride within reach
Do the right thing, eat the peach
So hit the thai, stick and listen to this
It’ll have you buggin’ like you wish you wasn’t
I’m AMG, the host of the most if you’re high
I’ll be your tour guide on this vertical joyride

[Interlude]
(DJ Quik “Tha Bombudd” playing in background)
Yeah, got a big ass sack, sounds bumpin’, coolin’ out
Check this

[Verse 2]
Now hoes, I love you without your clothes
When you’re puttin’ ‘em on, I wanna see you gone
Because my dick don’t eyes, I know you’re mesmerized by the size
So eat ‘em up like a burger and fries
‘Cause you’re a hoe, a tramp, a slut, and you suck dick
Giving up the lips in between your hips
You want me? A nigga with dick for days
Cash that pays, and hoes with big ass that sways
And I’m looking for a new Janine
To be my one and only dick fiend
PHAT—Pussy, Hips, Ass, and Titties
And I’ve got much big dick for the nitty gritty
I may swing and sing, jam like Teddy does
Some say you was a sucka nigga—no, never was
AMG, inhale deep so you can get a little high
On the Vertical Joyride

[Interlude]
(DJ Quik “Tha Bombudd” playing in background)
Yeah, shit is fuckin’ me up

[Outro]
(I’m outta here, peace)
Hit it, don’t babysit it
(Outta here)
Hit it, don’t babysit it
(Gone)
Hit it, don’t babysit it
(Yep yep)
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it, don’t babysit it
Hit it…
