[Lil 1/2 Dead talking]
Yeah, nigga

[All (3x)]
I still got the late night hype, I still got the late night hype
I still got the late night hype

[Verse 1 - Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Well if it's on like this then it's on like that
Me and my nigga Chill kickin' funky raps, huh
We got something that's tight
(what we gonne do right here is go back)
To what? the late night hype
So get around and lend an ear
And roll up a fat joint and crack a cold beer
I'm on my way to Compton, ain't no stoppin'
Me and my nigga Chill going straight ho'-hoppin'
We got us some figment and hit her to the telly
The hooker that I had had some hear on her belly
I took of her clothes and her pussy wasn't smelly
So I banked them walls all around the fucking telly
I hit it from the side, I hit it from the back
And all I could here was the hitboy smack
And my nigga named Chill screamin' the pussy's tight
Me and my nigga creepin' on that late night hype
Yeah nigga

[Hook (2x) - Lil' 1/2 Dead]
I still got the late night hype
I got a 40 but the cap's too tight
I still got the late night hype
I got a drink to get my head so right

[Verse 2: Tha Chill]
I still got the late night hype
Motherfuckers, uhh, do what you like
Yeah, my nigga Half said it just don't stop (stop)
Packin' big brogues hanging at the spot (spot)
Slanging lil' rocks till 10 o'clock hit
One of the homies put a lil' something on the lick
Look, oh shit, what the fuck, god damn
Let me use a nigga phone and call that nigga (ooh damn)
Caught up my luck, here he come swervin'
9 deep dippin' in the all blue Suburban
Me and Half Dead jumped in a lux
Caravan, to kidnap this black man
No pain, but the shit ain't funny
Nigga ain't thinking about shit but money
So pass me the bud and a motherfucking light
A twist up the eastside, westside, late night hype

[Hook (2x) - Chill]
I still got the late night hype
Smoking weed in [?]
I still got the late night hype
Smoking weed and my sex is tight

[Verse 3: AMG]
Oh lord have mercy, I might nogg that indo again
Hennesey or the juice and gin
Making money's not a job, it's adventure
See a big booty, I'ma pinch her
Mack with the bonk for your trunk
Bitch I got a dump for your romp
I make that booty go "bum-bump"
I'm with it
Big balling with my niggas Chill and Half
Making with the late night staff
Because abra cadabra, hoes wanna grab the
Dick like a microphone, daddy's home
Is it a misses, what is it a
I got ya name in my wishlist
Is a thong up-raiser
Talking like the prayer
Trick like a clamb
And the style is rap
And I'm fucking cause the feeling is right
Westside's in the house for the late night hype

[Hook (2x) - AMG]

I still got the late night hype
I need a big booty bitch tonight
I still got the late night hype
Gin and juice rest the party tonight

[AMG talking]
