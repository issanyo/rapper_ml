Check it out…

[Verse 1]
If you’ve got big ol’ booty
This new dance’ll be real groovy
(Shake it baby, don’t you break it
It took your mama 9 months to make it)
Bring me that big derriere
The one who’s got all that fake hair
And then we’ll see who can do this right
Y’all step back ‘cause I can do this all night

[Chorus]
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up

[Verse 2]
Way way way past O-eight-double-O
I’ll do the booty up 'til 10 o'clock tomorrow
But I need a booty that’s big and round
Just like the bass comin’ out my sounds, yo
Skip all the rigmorale
When I’m at a show, no bougie or hoes
Big butt girls are gonna clap for me
(When I stick out my booty, and mack to the freaks)
It’s better than a brand new exercise
Don’t close your eyes ‘cause you’ll get a surprise
Somebody mighta ate too much of a burrito
And then broke wind, again and again
Because a brotha like G don’t pass no gas
When you do the booty up you gotta watch your ass
Because united we stand, divided we dance
And if you got a lotta booty in your pants, then you gotta do…

[Chorus]
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up

[Interlude]
Ha, my fellow booty up brothas and sistas, ha
I want y’all to get out on the floor
And we gon’ commence to do the booty up
We’re gonna do it on the count of one
No, we’re gonna do it when we wanna do it, ha
Come on y’all and let’s do the booty up

[Verse 3]
You can do the booty up doggystyle
And remember never trust a big butt and a smile
Take it from a man who studied Bootyology
I can Monopoly and still do it properly
Everywhere I go, and everywhere I turn
I say the booty up, and people wanna learn
But I just laugh and say I gotta go
(‘Cause I gotta rest my booty ‘cause it’s kinda sore)

[Chorus]
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
