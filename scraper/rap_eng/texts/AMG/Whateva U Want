So you want love?, I'mma take you to the club
And let you shake your groove thang, baby that's the cut
Body like an hourglass, steppin' out the S-Class
Smoke filled with the tinted and the music on blast
Get down... yo before it's too late
And all the real party people let me hear you say, "turn it up"
Let it bang, cause when we party yo it ain't no thang
Even haters ain't hatin' on this here, them niggas gettin' beers
All the homies straight wet, hangin' off the chandelier
Three o'clock in the mornin', we ain't tired yet
That's how you do it when you fuckin' with them Compton vets
Full blown, and if her cock is gettin' hot then take her home
And when I hit it and I finish send her on
She ain't lovin' them niggas that play Capone
Baby shake it, get your groove on

[Hook: James DeBarge]
Keep the party poppin' everytime we bounce through it
Whatever you want... we can do it
I know you from the streets, but you ain't got to try to prove it
If that's what you want... we can do it

See most niggas don't know, I keep 'em broker
If I catch her slippin' up, nigga I'mma choke her
I got a lil' Ike in me, the reallionaire
Can make your ho stop and stare, do ya dare?
Niggas think they cops, cause they handcuffin' hoes
The ones with the pretty toes
And if she wit it - don't stop, get it get it
Give me twenty minutes to split it - forget about it
Rats to the chickens, niggas still trickin'
That's why she cheatin', and your dick you're beatin'
She love it when I rub it, in a Continental
And never knew I had the Presidential
Took her to the room, run to the boom-boom
With ocean view, showed 'em what I do
Baby it's a 304, 220 - freak party show... get your money ho

I need a shot of that brown liqour
I'm at the party man, the females hoo-bangin' harder than niggas
Now get the picture (Polaroid), '99 (on the grind)
Take it to the limit - make it, shake it
But don't spend it all in one spot girl
What's up on the thigh, can I get it hot?, with moist in your twat
Let me put it down, and move it around
Locally and the world, to all the women and girls
Shake that good thang God gave ya
I love ya too baby, but I ain't the one tryin' to save ya
Like the suckers that come to the party to straight trip
Spend they grip, talk shit, and get whipped
On the real like that, where the party still cracks
'til the one show out and turn the motherfucker out
Then it's on to the next house (what?)
Well if not - then it's on to the mo' so I can bust that thang out
