(Chorus)
My momma told me imma nuisance
I gotta talent that I do know what to do with
I gotta flow and I don’t know how to use it
And then I realized I could put it in the music
This is who I am
I’m a young man tryna make it out I’m in a drought
They been lurking tryna get to know me for the clout
I’m just waiting on the day that my parents tell me They proud
Soon as I can hit a stage then I know that it’s boutta go down
Everything thats truth to me I put in music yeah I swear
They be swearing I can’t do it but I really do not care
Promising that I won’t make it I think I’m already there
I been pushing for the goal I gotta to get it fair and square

(Verse 1)
This is a mission to get it I’ll never be finished until I’m in first place
Whole lotta demons been trynig to stop me the Alc and the weed was the first case
When I used to walk in the door and my momma was crying then that was the worst phase
Cuz she didn’t want me to leave but I left and I shoulda just stayed in the first place
Now I’m been gone I been doing my thing I won’t see em again til my birthday
It wasn’t the plan don’t know who I am so I gotta visit my birthplace
But all I been doing Is starting a movement and shaking them up like a earthquake
They see my potential and see my credentials and I’m changing up in the worst way
I been in a storm like a hurricane
I hate when you say that you heard thangs
Cuz they wanna talk ab me and my fam without even knowing my first name
All they say is that’s timeless
Have you heard ab him
He steady tryna make a basket
But it be rolling off the rim
He think his life is a game
He tryna take it for a spin
But they all sound the same
And I ain’t listening to them
Cuz I’m just waiting on the outcome
Got ppl waiting on an album
I’m reminiscing bout the fam now
I lost a brother so I’m down one

(Chorus)
My momma told me imma nuisance
I gotta talent that I do know what to do with
I gotta flow and I don’t know how to use it
And then I realized I could put it in the music
This is who I am
I’m a young man tryna make it out I’m in a drought
They been lurking tryna get to know me for the clout
I’m just waiting on the day that my parents tell me They proud
Soon as I can hit a stage then I know that it’s boutta go down
Everything thats truth to me I put in music yeah I swear
They be swearing I can’t do it but I really do not care
Promising that I won’t make it I think I’m already there
I been pushing for the goal I gotta to get it fair and square

(Verse 2)
All of my life I been different I never could fit in so that’s why I stayed down
So both of my parents thought it was a problem when they saw me switch when I came down
And now they been hating when I’m pulling up and everybody calling my name now
Cuz they never wanted me all in the world and they hate I’m embracing the the fame now
I tell em I still try to listen to God but I know that it’s never the same now
They talk ab him and I still try to listen but it’s ab running the game now
I used to tell all of my friends ab Jesus but now we all going the same route
And I’m feeling guilty cuz I’m at the top and I feel like it’s too late for change now
But this is the life that I chose
Diamonds are froze
Where I’m going who knows
I just really wanna be the man
I live a dream like petter pan
They be telling me to wake up imma wake up when I see the bands
Need to see the plans
Fore we advance
I been tryna make a new wave
I ain’t caring what ya crew say
They be claiming we the same thing but I change things never tushè
What I do say
Is imma really have to listen to spirit that been callin me
Cuz every move Im boutta make are decisions for new beginnings that’ll follow me

(Chorus)
My momma told me imma nuisance
I gotta talent that I do know what to do with
I gotta flow and I don’t know how to use it
And then I realized I could put it in the music
This is who I am
I’m a young man tryna make it out I’m in a drought
They been lurking tryna get to know me for the clout
I’m just waiting on the day that my parents tell me They proud
Soon as I can hit a stage then I know that it’s boutta go down
Everything thats truth to me I put in music yeah I swear
They be swearing I can’t do it but I really do not care
Promising that I won’t make it I think I’m already there
I been pushing for the goal I gotta to get it fair and square
