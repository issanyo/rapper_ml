Mausberg in the house, Sheppard Lane for life
And, uh, John Doe, AMG, Hi-C, mista Quik
Suga Free, G-One, let me break they back dog

[Mausberg]
Open up the door for mister Mausberg the Superb
Sheppard Lane, John Doe, fool you ain heard?
Something for the dance floor, put the dip in your hip
Get your vibe right baby, cus this track is a hit
We got Suga Free and Mr. Quik in the house
And I got sumthin for your mouth, "No Doubt"
I'm G'd up, my funk is P'd up
Females on my team, haters take the penis
My eyes be hella tight, chockin all out
I'm on my way to the bar, very important
I'm goin  drink all night
I see the this bad ass feline, baby what's up?
Can uh, you and Mausberg the Superb hook up?
Let's get it crackin, the funk is on this big black stallion
Crushed linen suits, gator boots,  straight stylin
Uh, and I ain't trippin on no straps tonight
Cus the essence of a true is to keep the vibe plus
So get up!

Chorus:
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(I can feel that), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that

[Amg]

If I lick you low, You'll be singing my song
Girl I'm Amg who you thought I was?
Sippin Henassy baby just because
If you wonderin why I'm on the go
You should understand, that I'm a jiggalo
Poor to rich to poor and to rich again
When I make you sin, I'ma get you in

[Crawf Dog]
Well I'm uh, sippin  a miller
Straight countin my scrilla
She said, "Watch you been doin? Cus yo thang is bigga"
They call me docta swipe
If your beat is tight
Dirk Digg-a-la
Gettin busier tonight
I know you're looking for a rap singa
Sittin at home watchin Jerry Springa
Straight got my phone jumpin off the ringa
After I was lookin for some ding-a-linga
But you can use your finga

Chorus:
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that

[Mausberg]
Now the party don't stop till I shake the spot
Mausberg the Superb, a sucka trick not
My game is wicked, baby did you feel this?
Comin at me foul, you can miss me with the bullshit
Take a sip of 'gnac, and kick back to this funky ass track
Amg, Hi-C, and T-tone  got my back
I can feel that, yup in a real way
Time to see these G's ha ha that's how we parlay
I don't give a damn baby if you got a man
We can take it to the beach, bump and grind in the sand
International gangsta, known for poppin crystal
Puffin on some bomb bomb rap in the black ??
That's how we do it in the west baby, take it or leave it
Two steps ahead of your game trick, believe it
Let me bless yo ass, as I hit it from back
When I'm finished pack yo shit, and get up, cus I can feel that

Chorus:(3x)
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(I can feel that), I can feel that

*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right), I can feel that
*scratching*(It's all right),I can feel that
*scratching*(I can feel that), Can y'all feel that?
Sheppard Lane tell me, Can you feel that?
Hi-C  tell me, Can you feel that?
