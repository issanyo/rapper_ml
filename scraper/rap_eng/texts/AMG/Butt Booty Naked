[Hook: Pee Wee Flex] {x2}
I wanna get ya butt booty naked can I wreck it baby?
(HEY!)
I wanna see your big booty naked can I wreck it baby?
(HEY!)

[Verse One: Pee Wee]
Well I'm a big booty sticker
Honey dip licker

I'ma do her from the backside and drive ya nuts
Spank you on the fanny while I'm digging out ya guts

[AMG]

I'm an expert
I'll make your body jerk
And if ya wanna flirt
I'll put that ass to work

[Pee Wee]
I'ma lay you on a mattress like a bedspread
And if it's that time of the month, baby use your head
A touchdown, a home run, another point scored
You might need some Tylenol from your head hitting the headboard

[AMG]
I'ma hit the hootie mack and hit the bootie crack
And if you want the big bootie smack, grab my nut sack

[Pee Wee]
Yelling out "Flexzure", now you got the feeling
Yo G this is Soul Train, I'm Don you Cornelius

[Hook]

[Verse Two: AMG]
I'm the big ding dong
King Kong
If you wanna bring your friend along, baby it's on
We can have a three company and while you're humping me
I'm a lone licker like porno flick

[Pee Wee]
Well I'm Flexzure I wanna sex y'all
Bump, hit the skins step back and let the coochie jump
Like a gang of brew when I'm like banging you
Have you screaming silly sounds and saying "oooooh"

[AMG]
If it's tight I'm right, if it ain't I can't
I'ma go up in ya till faint
Or until my nuts ache
Your legs in the air, booty everywhere
Call me Mr. Dairy Air cause right now I'm in there

[Pee Wee]
I be the pop wow, yippy I aye
With the rudest set, honey dip crack your legs
And be ready for the big backstroke
When the big jim pokes, wicked on the bed Pee ain't no joke

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Pee Wee]
I'm the freaky
Deaky

Be ready to drop your drawers baby when you meet me
Wreck the panty poom poom
We gonna use the whole room
Pee Wee Flex [?] makes the booty poom

[AMG]
And all I wanna do is zomma zoom zoom zoom
And get ya butt naked in a hotel room
I like ya style
I'm making money by the pile
I make ya smile
I can stay a little while

[Pee Wee]
Baby you and I can catch a thrill
From the man with the big diznill
"Poon" is my nickname, game for a dame
I'm a freak in the sheets, Flexzure has no shame

[AMG]
Now in the bubble bath I make ya laugh
Baby with the champagne I got booty on the brain
So catch me like a lover not another
I lick ya from ya toes to ya dome
Daddy's home

[Hook]
