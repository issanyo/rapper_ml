[Verse 1]
Memories are just where you leave them
Drag the waters, til the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was it something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

[Chorus]
Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

[Verse 2]
"Oh, hold me now, I feel contagious"
"Am I the only place that you've left to go?"
She cries her life is like
Some movie, black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

[Chorus]
Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

[Bridge]
And I wanted you to turn away
You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

[Chorus 2]
Don't fall away, and leave me to myself
Don't fall away, and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again

Woah Oooh Oh
