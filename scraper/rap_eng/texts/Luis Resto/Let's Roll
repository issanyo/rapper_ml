[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 1]
Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised
808 drums quaking, they shake that box, '88
And the dope boys hotter than hells gate
But I, still in the shade
With a fold out chair, with a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A, B-A-M-A
I’m off I might be in the lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case
Yeah I’m bringing the case
I’m getting throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 2]
And I’m all the way throwed off
Z71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat
Yeah buddy, might go off
Split you like a bowling ball
Spit chew in my overalls
Yeah home of the gumbo
Got a couple folks that’d do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That dixie cup's gonna fall off the console
You don’t wanna have a convo with not understand that Bama slanguage
Like hollering ain't it
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 3]
I’m just a Kid that Rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll
