[Verse 1]
I catch myself
Dreaming of a time I wasn't scared
A time when you were there
We would dare
Share our secrets
No regrets, I swear
This dream is all I care about
Looking at old snapshots
Hugging you with all I've got
Staring at old snapshots
Scratching my head a lot
And wondering

[Chorus]
Maybe, maybe, maybe
It could happen again
I'd love to be that
Maybe, maybe, maybe
It could happen again
I'd love to be that

[Verse 2]
Friend you once knew
You would be the same to me
We grew
Far apart, it's true
Nowhere to start
Seems we're dead
But still a heart's a heart
A heart's a heart

[Bridge]
Beating with all it's might
Howl like wolf at night
Looking for one small light
Just hoping for one small light

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Friend
I'd love to be that
I'd love to be that friend
I'd love to be that friend
I'd love to be that
