[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips, to ever kiss ass squished
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, 'cause we can
And they can't spit, and they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport, anymore when you gotta go and
Resort back into that shit maybe I'm old-fashioned
But my passion, is to smash anyone rapping
Without having to slap him, believe me
I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic 'cause I'm telling you right now
You're not gonna like it, 'cause if I
Get pushed over the edge, then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a Pit Bull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you, like crazy glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone like Keith Murray, when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally, I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof - are you with me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

[Verse 2: Swifty]
They consider me the, epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust
To whoever ain't cautious, In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading, when you meet me
Better speak like it's Seasons Greetings, either that
Or we'll be beefing frequent, niggas need an E just to speak shit
[?] there's a petite bitch, keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it, and won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it, from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway, you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us but so what
This beef is like what the fuck, did he say in his rap?
Em, I can see that he just a punk, I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me
Pleased when seeing guts, I donâ€™t need no enemies
Just my family, a couple trucks, and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
WHAT! I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach, and when they want it I'll bring
A hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning
