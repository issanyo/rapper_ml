[Intro]
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And suckas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in you for running with me
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1]
Now first off Hip-Hop's a competitive game
And everybody's either after money or fame
I'm after the latter, so throw dirt on my name
Then I'll reciprocate, multiply, and double your pain
I don't play and eye for an eye, no tooth for a tooth
More like you call out my mic, and I'm destroying your booth
I don't think you're prepared to do what you gotta do
You lay a hand on me, I'll lay a hollow on you
I'm a little to grown to be fighting and scrapping
So if you walk up on me I'll put a round in your skullcap
Threaten me in voice mails where it's easy to act
Enact any violence, I'll put it all in the past
I don't go anywhere without a weapon concealed
Don't test me 'less you wanna know how metal feels
I've come closer to killing myself than any of you will
So don't come to see me unless you're ready to kill

[Hook]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

[Verse 2]
Make a lot of enemies when you're the only one that's real
Oh no, can't say that you're the only one that's real
Oh no, that don't fly, it's the competitive nature
But unlike you I'll go to any lengths for
My respect, now it's a war that you've started
A forest fire, and you just plain retarded
Not flame retardant, homie you not hard at all
If there's a heart in your chest I hope you guard it
Finger on the trigger if you're the one that I come for
Then I leave you stretched out I ain't playing this summer
Threaten the only one that's done work for
His city, the mile high lyrical head hunter
Where you been...not shooting
I host the D like DJ Whoo Kid
Hardest thing you say: "Don't make me catch a body like that"
But Hiatus ain't scared of nobody like that

[Hook]
