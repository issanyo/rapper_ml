[Verse 1]
Suited and booted, I've been hit by Cupid
I'm being recruited
I'm ready for more, I'm ready for war
Hold your position, load up ammunition
I won't fail this mission
Cause baby I'm yours

[Hook]
Cause where I'm from
We live by the love, die by the love
We live for the love, die for the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, love

[Verse 2]
Now many men
Many, many, many men, wish death upon me
Have mercy on me
Cause I'm just a prisoner of your army of one
But I'll fight to the death or until your heart has won

[Hook]
Cause where I'm from
We live for the love, die for the love
We live by the love, die by the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, love

[Verse 3]
Which side? This side, you should switch sides
On that acting like a bitch side by the way
You need to switch sides right away
(We can live forever, maybe die today)
Love side, hate side, never in between
That's what we stand for, y'all fall for anything
Westside, Westside, by the way
Live forever for love or you can die today

[Hook]
Cause where I'm from
We live by the love, die by the love
We live for the love, die for the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, love
