[Chorus]
Hey, now man's own kin
We commend into the wind
Grateful arms limbs
Grateful soul he's gone again

[Verse 1]
I have a winter's tale
How vagrant hearts relent prevail
Sow their seed into the wind
Seize the sky and they're gone again
Fame is fleeting, God is nigh
We raise our arms to him on high
We shoot our flint into the sun
We bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone

[Chorus]
Hey, now man's own kin
We commend into the wind
Grateful arms limbs
Grateful soul he's gone again

[Interlude]
Here a man, man's own kin
Turned his back and his own people shot him
And he fell on his knees
Before the burning plain
And he beheld fields of gold his land, his son
And he arose his blood aflame
Clouds pressed with hand prints stained

[Verse 2]
One last breath, the sky is high
The hungry earth, the empty vein
The ashes's rain, death's own bed
Man's own kin into the wind
One last breath, hole in life
Love knot tied, braid undone
A child born, the hollow horn
A warrior cried, a warrior died
One last breath, lick of flame
Spirit moaned, spirit shed
The heavens fed man's own kin
Grips the sky and he's gone again

[Chorus]
Hey, now man's own kin
We lay down into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful heart is gone again
Hey, now man's own kin
We lay down into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful heart is gone again
