[Intro: Eminem & Bizarre]
We got something for the bitches
These bitches always be all, giggling and shit
But they get mad when their favorite song don't come on in the club
Catch an attitude and shit
So we got one for them, it goes like this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear it, here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking too fast it just means you're listening too slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, bitch
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah, you just made me mess up, bitch
Blibiri babiler blabber, it don't matter, I'm just blabbering
Like you understand what I'm saying anyway
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fucking drunk all you hear is the beat b-b-beat
I could be saying anything, just get your ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Verse 2: Swifty]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging and fuck calling home
Until you look at me, before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak, but I'm taking the key with me
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes bitch I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home full, eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless you're hoeing
When I'm done, I'll throw you out and ask you where you going

[Verse 3: Bizarre & Eminem]
Ho ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp
Oh, how you doing, Sheryl
Ever since I was eight I been starting to hate
I said fuck the hoes and started eating cheesecake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberries and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait... Bizzy!
Okay back to the bitches, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches, a fucking half Indian chick, sucked my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
And they ain't now and laters, bitch

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Verse 4 / Skit: Kon Artis, Kuniva & Dina Rae]

[Verse 5: Proof]
Oh you a bitch but don't choke
I say the same to my Momma

Shit, we banging Madonna
Watch her strip you on that ten bitch ain't got change for a dollar
Blow your tongue and give this one the mouth you came with a condom
Quick cum is the motto, so just swallow and breathe
Swallow and breathe, now swallow these seeds
I know you mocha lotti Mommies won't get down on your knees
You want some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a model you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp bitch don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt cause men just
Party and bullshit till she gargle and swallow the dick
I'm taking the train to spain, don't bother calling me, bitch

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch

Wiggle that ass, bitch

What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch

Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Outro: Kon Artis & Eminem]
