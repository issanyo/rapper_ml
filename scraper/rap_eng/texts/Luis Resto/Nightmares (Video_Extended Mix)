[Verse 2]
Armed and dangerous, AKs turn your brains to mosh
Mix my weed with angel dust, feds label us notorious
Van Dyke nigga that love to bust. You laid to us
That nigga thats baggin and tacklin
Coming with strings and violins
That violent shit
On them beds we lyin in
We like to sin
High off speed and nitrogen
So much dope, it's toxic shit
You try to go to sleep - oh not again
I wouldn't snooze if I was you
You know what Gordy gon do to you
King of these dreams since '92
Look at all the hell I've took him through
Can't lay down cuz you know who
Comes right in and haunting you
Really wanna know what death like? Well, I'm the nigga to fuck wit
You niggas can't bust clips (cuz) me and Fat Killahz love the dumb
Shit
Fuck this shit, grab the AK
All the intentions to hit your face
Hit your waist, grab your shit
Peel this gat, spatter quick
I don't think you wanna fight, son
Blood will spill all of the night, punk
All these hoes, I have to hit once
Crack or blow, you got to try one
Got ten blunts, I got to light one
So what you gonna do, get high or what?

[Hook]
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me

GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!

[Verse 3]
(I'M A LIVE WIRE) Burn up the stage with high adrenaline
(FLYIN HEIGHTS) That purple haze, go cop some switches then
(LIGHT TIGHT) Son his ass, punch him by his ear lobes
(KNIFES SLICE) Cut his ass, gut him right in here yo
(MAD BITES) Don't let your parents know you blow crack again
(NIGHT LIFE) Got you sellin your soap mouth and ass again

[Hook]
Don't let me fall asleep

He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!

[Verse 4]
You can't stay awake. You hate the way you think
You blaze and blaze for days
You contemplating ways to put 38s to brains
Look who I made insane. Move and I break you frame
I'm gruesome with hand grenades
You choose to shoot thangs and thangs
We lootin you, take your chain
We touch you with crazy gangs
We'll do you like candid AIDs
We'll screw you till man it's made
Do you till man has sprayed
We stupid with foolish face
Illusions hallucinate
Coming with nuisance fades. (How you doin?)
I can't complain, just the usual paper chase
Spit fluid, amazing statements
With music that bangs the pavement
How can take the pain like sewage for stinkin basements
Your food is tastin tainted
Your crew, they be the greatest?
Is it true, they can't be faded?
If it's true, I came to spray them, slangin tomatoes
We knew that you lay awake
You can not be saved
From a voodoo playing with Satan
The usual crazy patient

[Hook]
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!

[Verse 5]
Yo, I don't think they heard me the first time dog... HIT 'EM AGAIN!
