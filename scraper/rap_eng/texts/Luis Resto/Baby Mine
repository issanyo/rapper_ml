[Bonnie Raitt]
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

And if they knew sweet little you
They know that love in you too
And all those same people who scold you
What they'd give for just the right to hold you

From your head to your toes
You're not much, Goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Cute as can be, baby of mine

Oh, you know that you're so precious to me
Baby of mine
(Baby of mine)
(Baby of mine)
Ooh
