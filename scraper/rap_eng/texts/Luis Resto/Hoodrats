[Verse 1]
My hoodrat's fatal, they not stable
I could be at a dinner table
With 'Union, Gabrielle', fine as hell, pierce in the naval
Look at my rat like she act brand new
"Hey boo, how are you?"
Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room
You see me with Pocahontas
I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered
You got a brain, define honors in college
You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic
I'm tryin step my game up a notch, bitch
Your aim to cock block on my plot, bitch
She hot and you're not, so stop bitch
Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit

[Hook]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
You're playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho

[Verse 2]
They chase me (Obie, Obie), when they see me in the club
With a lot alike Stacey Dash, they gettin mad
Then, they wanna brag and say "already had 'em"
He ain't shit cause he rap for Mr. Mathers (girl)
Plus 50 Cent's like ten times badder (girl)
D12 shouldn't of had him on they album" (girl)
That's what I get just for stabbin them hoes
They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes
Ya'll knew 'O' before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho
Just act like you never knew 'O', boo
We still crew, we just the same (uh huh)
Just not tonight, you don't know my name (you don't know me)

[Hook]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
You're playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho

[Verse 3]
Hey yo fellas, never get timid when the chicken is interferin
When your chillin with a chick, who a ten (damn)
Let her know the situation at hand (uh huh)
And tell the bitch go play with her friends (BITCH)
This is for the model that your chillin with, hoodrats is often awful
My advice keep your mouth on muffle
Feistiness give 'em the right to snuff you, and you too pretty to scuffle
This is for the rats, go on with that (go on)
Quit actin like you smokin that crack
Cause he pokin that chick, you ain't ownin on shit
Ain't no rings on that finger
And every nigga in the hood ain't triple teamed her

[Hook]

[Obie Trice - talking]
That's right, ha, you see me at the club
With a, with a look-alike Halle motherfucker
Look alike, look a, look alike Alicia Keys
Haha, you don't know me
Don't say shit, you know who I'm talking to
All my hoodrat bitches
Neneh, Aqua and Trip Entanetta
Haha, all ya'll
I'm straight, Obie Trice
