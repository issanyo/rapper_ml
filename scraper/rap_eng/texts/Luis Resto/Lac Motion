Screech out, yeah
That's what I'm talkin 'bout {*bzzt*}
Ca$his, Shady {*bzzt*}
Good lookin Em

We in the Cadillac Cartel and Snoop DeVilles
Ridin on Treys like Barksdale, I'm movin steel
Step out and see the new Car-mellos you would steal
But you ain't runnin around here cause dude is real
You dub for fifteen minutes sayin they shoot and steal
I would tell you more, but I think, you would squeal
I'm ridin at the wheel, lean back, poppin pills
I make a lil' side money plus I got a deal
I'm nine kids deep; see, why I gotta deal?
And serve so the government, can't touch my skrill
Before I'm sittin in my big, house, on the hill
Dark, not in H.B., Hall go, have a meal
I am the bogus boy, that was in my uncle's will
You figured that out, and see that I'm a G for real
And fear man is one thing that he don't feel
Knock a nigga out, while his gun on him still

[Hook: Ca$his]
'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back on the 'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back screech out

New Makaveli jeans, five Vicks, Blue Leaf
Tall tee, hang to my motherfuckin knees nigga
I got a gang of my partners from O.C., figure
If it's some drama they all, ridin with me if ya
Recognize a situation that you can't win
You may feel like a marked mellow but you can live
Still you tryin to be hard, yellin out stupid shit
I just look at you laughin, say that you a bitch
I got somethin from class despite my truant seers
But I can whoop on yo' ass homie if you in Sears
It's better not to be brash and come with foolishness
Talkin 'bout my county 'til you see how true it is
Come to the 7-1-fo', Glizzy could get you rich
Some of the homies got dough, the rest is militant
We got goons that's loon tootin them wicked sticks
My whole set to end, Shady that's what the bid'ness is

We switchin lanes and candy paints on 22's
And '83s and '88s, in grammar schools
Different names of the 'Llac, I hear the hundred crews
Miss the exit, that's all from gettin blunted fool
Flick the tussin, a couple buzzards is comin through
Soon as they see me say "Ca$h, I wanna fuck wit'chu"
So many niggas is lamed out, and gullible
We make 'em lookouts in fog eyes for copper moves
I was livin the life, of sellin rocks to dudes
When I got to a block, I was unstoppable
I had to serve out the 'Llac, cause they was watchin moves
But bein poor was just, somethin I couldn't do
I wanna roll in a six-hundred and stunt on you
Next time I see you and yours, I'll pull a gun on you
Through every stage of my life, I been that fuckin dude
You should be glad I took, time to fuck wit'chu
