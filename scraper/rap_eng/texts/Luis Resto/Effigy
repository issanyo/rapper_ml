[Verse 1]
Scissors slice the scene in two
Leaving me with one hand by my side
A pile so high I guess we're through
Can't imagine why you would break your stride
At torching everything that vaguely might remind
Of the crown of thorns you wore with me
You've long since left behind

[Chorus]
Don't burn my effigy
The doll that's hanging with a face
Made up like mine
Don't burn my effigy
The one marked 'enemy'
Two black holes for eyes that are blind
Don't burn my effigy
Remember Dorothy
And the tinman with his heart of gold
Don't burn my effigy
Please find a heart for me
Let me bring back to you, the love I stole

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd call to hear, what's new
You only said "goodbye", but you sounded swell
Just dropped by to see
How you've been getting along without my hell
Must be going fine
You're looking so serene
Hits me like a brick, got a nervous tick
Here's one last primal scream

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a long shot
I know you think that it's impossible
And you'd be better off alone
That's why I've joined one hundred congregations
Of all denominations bound to be one
That's right for me
Will change me, rearrange my head
To be just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen

[Chorus]
