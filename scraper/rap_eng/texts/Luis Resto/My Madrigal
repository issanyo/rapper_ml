We waltzed beneath motionless skies
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes
We expressed such sweet vows

Oh, 'til death do us part
Oh, 'til death do us part

We waltzed beneath God's point of view
Knowing no ending to our rendezvous
We expressed such sweet vows

Oh, 'til death do us part
Oh, 'til death do us part

We waltzed beneath motionless skies
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes
You pledged me your heart
'Til death do us part
You pledged me your heart

Oh, 'til death do us part
Oh, 'til death do us part
