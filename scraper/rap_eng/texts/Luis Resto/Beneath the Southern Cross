Oh, to be
Not anyone, gone
This maze of being, skin
Oh, to cry not any cry
So mournful that
The dove just laughs
And the steadfast gasps

Oh, to owe not anyone nothing
To be not here but here
Forsaking equatorial bliss
Who walked through
The callow mist
Dressed in scraps
Who walked

The curve of the world
Whose bone scraped
Whose flesh unfurled
Who grieves
Not anyone, gone
To greet lame
The inspired sky
Amazed to stumble
Where gods get lost
Beneath the southern cross
