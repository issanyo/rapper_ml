[Ca$his]
Yeah
It's Ca$his, I'm comin, uhh
Shady Records niggas, GO!

[Verse 1]
Walkin, with a semi cocked, flip down any block
Get cash, plenty guap, talk hard gettin shot
Went to war with the cops, you reach for what I got
Treat you like Singapore, swing a sword, you are chopped
Picture me pistol-free, "Look at me, look at me"
And realizing none of y'all is hood as me
That's on e'rythang, take six to your frame
Your son caught in strays, he gon' die any day
Try and act brave, tell the law my name
I bet your family won't live to see another day
There is no other way, you hearin what I say
I got paper now, I can fight the case

[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule
Walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule

[Verse 2]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime
Stick, niggas for they shine, yeah, you been on the grind
Yeah, take your jewelry off and pass it to me, it's mine
Cohort, me and my cohorts on codeine
Conspire and rioting, robbin niggas for more cream
Step on work, eighth by eighth
Six points off a quarter nigga, stretch that cake
I ain't chillin on the corner, you fall in your order
For eightballs and nope, I ain't holdin nothin short, yeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
We live by gun rule!
Shady Records nigga
I'm ridin through to Annis{?}
With my forks up folk, G's up!
