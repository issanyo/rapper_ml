[Chorus]
In the kitchen (putting work)
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen (let's go)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Said I'm here for money making, I've done lost 'bout all my patience
Beat almost all my cases, thought I'd covered up all my bases
Bitches try to play you till somehow, some way you figure it out
You fuck with Jay Z's bitch from back in the day you might end up with reasonable doubt
You fuck with grimy bitches standing over you taking pictures
While you sleeping, 'cause you passed out drunk after having a threesome
That will give you a reason, to trust no bitch, quit rappin'
And just go get it crackin' (in the kitchen) 'Bout to push that
White instead of that music, seems like simpler profit, 'cause nigga's gossipin'
Like they WorldStar, M.T.O, Bossip, until I find you and empty your pockets
If 5'9" stop rhyming, I'm driving on I-95
Or I am (in the kitchen) I will cop a key and put it

[Chorus]
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Can't tell y'all
If I did drugs or if they did me, nah, we was just doin' each other
We were side by side like e'ryday, didn't care if we ruined each other
Back then it was so real, fully automatic, it was overkill
I was on weed, I was on dust, might'a tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears, my mind gone, wasn't on bills
Whole fam'ly disappointed in me, can't imagine how that made my mom feel
Her one's missin', guns hidden, sorry Momma, your son's trippin'
Got baggies scattered (in the kitchen)
Plus, plus you and Dad was' on the same road, y'all just left, made it right
If I ain't learn I'd do the same, pour some liquor, say goodnight
Now I'm on this music shit, tryna get this paper right
If not I'll be back (in the kitchen)

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Let me get it now
On Twitter, they murder my mentions, 'cause they heard
I was served by a circle of henchmen, layin' in a dirty ditch, that bullshit is further than fiction
They personal mission's worse than snitchin', to any person that listen
Now I wanna kill a hater, a middle finger by the 'fridgerator, flip a bird in the kitchen
'Cause DJ Vlad, he was glad bullets went into me
Just to get traffic for his site, should'a did him like MMG (faggot)
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back (in the kitchen), but should I be?
'Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse is about to cop that Shady deal
I'm out here chasin' that paper still, push kush, coke and crazy pills
Me being shot online didn't stop my grind, nigga, I don't mind
And if I don't rhyme (I'm in the kitchen), I will cop a key and put it

[Chorus]
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Just when a nigga thought it couldn't get worse
The hearse reversed; scooped my cuz up after grandma left Earth
That recent shit, I was a young and bummy piece of shit, cursed
No decent kicks cause mom kept enough of that snow to ski in her purse
No father, Jux passed me my first gun, revolver
With the serial carved up, Real showed me my first jump, I'm a barber
Shaving the crack, after weighing the crack
An then placing the crack in 12 12's
I ain't play with the crack, I was making up stacks
All day I just sat (in the kitchen), bringing it back
Now I'm tryna do my thing with this rap
Hope this works, trying to flip words so my homies
Ain't gotta flip birds On the curb
Then black on a yellow belly coward homie feel like Pittsburgh
Lord I thank you, for making me able to find my way through
If not I be back at my momma's table (in the kitchen)

[Chorus]
In the kitchen (putting work)
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen
