[Verse 1]
Well, I guess I'm freaking forty
I can't say that I am thrilled
I never dated or known a writer
I'll probably never will
Well I guess I'm freaking forty
Oh, but I'm better of them some
Well I might be freaking forty
But you're freaking forty-one

[Verse 2]
Well I guess I'm freaking forty
Now all the kids call me old man
I.. and a freaky...exam
I guess I'm freaking forty
But I'm better off than you!
Well I might be freaking forty
But you're freaking forty-two
Oh right!

[Verse 3]
Well, I guess I'm freaking forty
Well I'm a Peter at Peter Pan
And sometimes I feel foolish
I make my living singing in this band
I guess I'm freaky forty
Well that's what my momma said
But Bruce Springsteen is freaky sixty-two
And the Stones are almost dead

[Verse 4]
Well, I guess I'm freaking forty
I can't say that I am thrilled
I still have a â€¦ cowboy
I don't need the little blue bills
I guess I'm freaking forty
Forty isn't nothing to me
Well I might be freaky forty
Hell I'm lying, I'm forty-three!
