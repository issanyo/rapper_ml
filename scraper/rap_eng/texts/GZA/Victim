[Hook: Joan Davis]
Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

[Verse 1: GZA]
Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence working for small pay
World so little he could never leave his block
His home bullet-riddled so he always need his Glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smoking
Young wasted minds fiending on dimes, coking
Forgot kids quick to break rules and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets we more safe than school
There's no diploma that can break you from the coma
Of a bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner hyenas amongst me
Yapping 'bout the stories they be hearing, always swearing
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearing
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreaming
Screaming how we never hold positions, that's the meaning
Mothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came 'til I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name... the GZA

[Hook: Joan Davis]
Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

[Verse 2: Njeri Earth]
My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set up their shops
And cops watch innocent niggas roaming in flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner plot
To get money knots some funny niggas act like
They could pop Glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters giving up ass a lot, brothers giving up cash a lot
Babies struggling to become someone because their parent's not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devils uncivil society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks and wrists
The God is now a dog, the Earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness to push a Lexus
Ice on everything from rings and bracelets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest-infested buildings
Seeds uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilings
Is peeling off, but all I see is lost black babies calling
"Please somebody save me, please somebody save me"

[Hook: Joan Davis] (x2)
Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

[Outro: Joan Davis]
Just another... just another... victim of the ghetto
