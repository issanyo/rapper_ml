[Verse 1]
From the mind, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
There was enormous energy - it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space
Special place with information encased
One of infinite beginnings this cosmic clock was ticking
And allowed space to float while it was spinning
All that you see around us
Sun, the Moon and stars - millions of worlds that astound us
The universe in size is hard to fathom
When composed in a region small as a single atom
One billionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic, on a macro level within
And unfurled the swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy, with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanded beyond comprehension
Then a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size but very unstable
In time it would come with the periodic table
Space was expanding faster than light speed
Moving at the speed only thought can exceed
A picosecond after The Big Bang, music of the spheres
Before the ears, the universes now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of the second later - 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since its time of birth

[Chorus]
Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams
Images beyond your wildest dreams

[Verse 2]
Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was spinning within the batter
But mass and energy are interchangeable
Convert those particles, not to name a few
Matter and antimatter, the arch-rival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there's life and breath there's one remaining left
But an imbalance caused particles to vibrate
Away from the galactic center at high rates
So fast becoming a liquid
And it would be 300,000 years before it dripped it
Despite being perfect, it was in turmoil
Then it would fall back under pressure, recoil
Subatomic particles smashed into each other
Continuous energy years before discovered
Then it slowed down and began to bond
Creating atoms - building blocks of matter and beyond
It was now eight times the size of the solar system
Distance, thorough measurements, I enlist them
Sixty billion miles in diameter
Temperature of seventeen trillion Fahrenheit to damage ya
And it was only a millionth of a second old
And it would be another million years before turning cold

[Chorus]
Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams
Images beyond your wildest dreams
