You no longer have to stand in front of me to feel my presence, to reach out and touch me
To offer not only words of support but a comforting hand
Live my experiences from one thousand miles away
Feel sand pour out of your hands on the beach in Hawai'i from a subway station in New York
Share my pain, my joy, my triumphs, and failures
You don't have to be there to be here
The Seven Senses advanced cellular phone network will connect you in every way: verbally, mentally, spiritually and physically
