Yeah, yeah, yeah - one two, one two
Aiyyo, Wu-Tang's invincible
But understand the principle
My man Muggs, droppin phat tracks like drugs
Breaker-breaker one two, breaker-breaker one two
You're breakin' up - peace

"We're at the crossroads, our immediate future
Is the worst war man will ever know."

[Verse One: Genius/GZA]
Via satellite from the Wu-mansion
Still branchin' off the tree that sparked any MC
And the fruit that fell far was the ripest
It was Cypress, let the media hype this
Promotion niggas snipe this
Push it like tray bags of 72
Kept niggas in suede rags
Microphone psycho, who flips the mic so well
Hell without bail, in jams packed like jail-cells
Theres no escaping, once my blade starts scrapin'
Niggas flakin', wannabe MCs is shakin'
My sword indeed make more niggas bleed
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed
I lost ya, wit that offer; nigga that'll cost ya
Feel the strings of torture
Must've been the half-gal
That's the shit he drinkin', that got him thinkin'
That he could trash the ship and get me sinkin'
I told him, "Come back when you're sober"
Drunk-ass punk, on the motherfuckin' Hunt for Red October
Don't even catch me when I'm blunted
Rhymes start runnin' like loops on a SP-1200
Instruments the terror on warship, its corporate
Visual niggas paint portraits

[Verse Two: RZA]
Yo, Check the mic line for wire-taps
We're under attack, man your stations, take aim, proceed
Fire back, all hands on deck: cadet, vets, insert cassettes
Tracks snap heads like berets; catch web-sites like internet
Chief, I detected vehicles approaching from the East
Pass the infrared binoculars, captain, so I can see
Sound the alarm; call for the suicidal-kamikaze ninjas with the bombs
Flashes of neon, all we saw was flying arms
Anytime I come by, alumni cut short their air supply
Send 'em back like George McFly
I, be holdin' this; travel ground like a motorist
Poisonous gas released from my track, its odorless and tasteless
Like Ghost is face-less
Which allowed the God to break backs, and beat a hundred cases
MCs heads weave like trees, in a breeze to rhymes like these
Underwater flow strike like torpedoes
You get plugged more than Del Rio; played short like De Vito
Split the fuck up like Mike-Jack and Tito
Sword cuts sharper than Concorde needles
Call my second private, tell 'em write this important message to Cypress
I heard Yacub's assistant on the island was Dr. Titus
And they just released a new deadly virus
To infiltrate the Western States
It's time to pump out more rap tapes
And use the Wu-Tang symbol to communicate
RZA, over and out...
