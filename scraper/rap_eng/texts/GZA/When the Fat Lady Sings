[GZA]
Whether describing facts or interrupted by quotes
Cease the bullshit, rely on volts
Just like watts push the juice through amps
Rap generals running troops in camps
Armed with heavy slugs, under rugs, thoughts bugged
No holds barred, live and unplugged
Trapped on the other side, of electrified, steel doors
Once in, greeted with thunderstorm applause
The message breaks the concrete barrier
Launch the vessel, known as the A-1 carrier
Sound going through a cable, who the fuck able
Mix this shit, but your turntable unstable
So if the beat smash your eardrum, you heard well
Then the tube tech equalize occurs well
Beats straight off the box, rhyme unorthodox
From the Isle', where the drinks splash straight off the rocks
