[Verse 1: Dante]
Ecology is life
Life that surrounds us
Everyday living with the things that we bundle up
A single cell organism is the things that we coming from
Coming from the brain cus im insane in the membrane
Shout out to the lyrical miracle together
We are two lyrical individuals
All miracles start from something
The center of it is the nucleus
Cells divide and soon life is surrounding us

[Verse 2: Athen]
A girl wants to have a baby
Call that ovulation
Gotta concentrate on the first verse like the first step
Like fertilization
This sort of flow
Is a boat that'll never sees too float
Bringing old school rap with science
Like parental chromosomes
Watch every eye on me together like a morula
About 64 if you want a number now thats a show
Even though im blastocyst
Just a little hollow my fans follow
My fans follow Athen the great voice of tomorrow
Check my check my check my check my
Check my check my flow 1234
Like the cells in the embryos
Kicking down your door
I connect with my fans
Like a placenta
I nourishing with the knowledge
And excreting all the extra
And so I spit the extra
About ecology and biology
Shout out to Miss B
Cause she helped me see life logically
So you know I got to finish
You the turtle in this rabbit race I'm winning
And I will forever be spitting
And rocking the shows for centuries and more
In this rap game, I'm trying to hit the high score
But for now I'm delivering just like an umbilical cord

[Verse 3: Delgado]
Oh god, where do i start, with human body parts
The first to do it Adam and Eve, or what you believe
The topic of discussion, talking 'bout these bodily functions
They got me rapping about sexual reproduction
Bars like a Twix split in 2 like a daughter cell
Kit-Kat got 4 the second telophase okay let's even the score
But back it up to the beginning of time
Well lets just say we beat our homies to the finish line
And if we didn't, best believe me then we would dead
It's like a million man march for a boiled egg
But the product is a living organism, with a heart and brain
Genetics from my pops, that's how this young spitter got his name
This girl said we gon' lose, but I don't believe in abortion
But I heard she got flow so I gotta take precaution
I got various flows like a chromosome
Macaulay Culkin in this game I guess I'm home alone
