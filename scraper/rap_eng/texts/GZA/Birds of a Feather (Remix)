[Verse 1: Mocky]
The rain came to my treetop
And it washed away oh so many things
Things I couldn't learn till I went through
Things I didn't know until I met you

[Chorus: Mocky]
Now I'm learning the hard way
Learning the hard way
Learning the hard way to be true
Now I'm learning the hard way
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2: GZA]
They say the early bird gets the worm
Cause he never has to fight for the crumbs and then take flight and turn
Especially the thousand up in the tree all whistling
A natural alarm clock for those who's listening
The melody is music to the ear
The vibrational effect has already set, I use it like it's gear
Some like to spread their wings and go skydiving
Razor sharp talents, they snatch things and seek hiding
King's sight even at great heights
Moving with the wind of the day and up in the nest at late night
A few presidents use feathers for ink pens
They sign on the dotted line and that's where the link ends

[Chorus: Mocky]
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh
