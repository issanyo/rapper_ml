[Hook: TiJay]
Digestive, endocrine, immune, lymphatic
End your body system, your crew don't want no static
Muscular, urinary, skeletal
We win the battle, capture your mental
Respiratory, nervous, you're nervous
Nervous, you're nervous
Nervous, you're nervous

[Verse 1: The Bishop]
The science knowledge is flowing out of me like a drug
And I'm never running out of energy mitocondria
And my flow is pretty nasty, it's catchy, it's flashy
And none of you wack rappers can't match me
My team is here to break down the human body systems
And diseases too because most of y'all have some symptoms
But I digress, the problem is most of you cats can't even digest
Digest, I eat my competition up
And all I know is I got them shaking like asma pump

[Verse 2: AJay]
Chewing your food while eating dinner
Down to the throat to the stomach and liver
It produces the bile, it's cleaning the system
The food goes down symptom by symptom
The food melts down on the gastric acid
Classic, it's on the stomach acid massive
Tactic, my bars are everlasting
Double two to the four, call me fantastic
Yeah, this is serious, I'm feeling delirious
Survival of the fittest, evolution
George, I'm curious
