[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Ain't nothing changed, RZARectah
Yo Gleamz, throw it up
Yo, 12, you see him over there? (bododododo)
Shitty, Merdoc, you take the front
Zoo Keeper, you come wit me, let's go

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Knock knock, guess who came knockin' at your door
It's them Brooklyn Zu dudes and we back for more
Knock knock, we from the slum where poppers are from
Get your facts right, game tight, ain't playing tonight
Knock knock, this ain't right, cuz change light that bring light
Same night, watch the story tonight
Knock knock, if you didn't wanna play wit these cats
You should of shut ya ass up, now it's lay where you at
So knock knock

[Buddha Monk]
Dartsman, marksman, captain of the starship, you can mark this
The night that you reached your darkening
Zu blade master from the Dirt Dog Chapter
Get snapshot, exit wound back and G cut after
Lay my life on the line for any Cuffie Crime nigga
Stand trial, lay 'em down, blame cats uptown now
My dig, came to Dirt, nigga, so this off hurt critters
Got ghost getter, under Roc-A-Fella in winter
Peep me in the Maybach, 12 boomin' on haze back
Gleamz, you got made gat, take aim, refrain at
It's the payback, Shitty hit 'em wit the mack
Merdoc gon' wild, Zoo Keeper got watch
Damn right we do it, how we gotta
After that, post up and bury chicks
Sippin' on a new trick, the casualty's reality
The gun game, the slug name, end game
Ya life nothing but memories and shames

[Chorus]

[GZA]
For those who thought it would of been a drought forever
Flood the city wit plenty rain and call wicked weather
The scale of the event was unprecedent
MC's reactions, delayed and hesitant
Swords are bent, the gravity gon' mad
Heavy rhymes they move through the galaxy on pads
While traveling, they test air and change seasons
Collide with exploding stars and rap breathings
The dominant factor within the universe
Highest form of light that live off the grains of Earth
Never go against it, because it's not the objective
Plus there's no room for error on the different descriptive
Yo, I still write the raw uncut material
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
Words are like bullets, verses are like clips
Rhymes are just guns, cannons that sink ships

[Chorus]

[12 O'Clock]
Dope man, dope man, I got the snub in my right hand
Traffic coke in the Mazda van
My whole team Supreme Clientele like Ironman
28, turn a range in his tan, man
When I drive with my seeds, there's no contraband
Like shooting revolvers, it's auto jam
Got the baseball bat, head's a ball, man
MOney tall, and nigga, this is midget man
Cut up coke, I'm Edward the Scissorhands
Niggas is pussy, all I see is panties, man
Carry tools on my belt, like a handy man
Smoke O.G. kush with Method Man

[Chorus]
