When a man and woman make love in a bed or sofa
And then the sperm have a journey just to try to reach the ova
Then when it enters the cervix, the sperm start running
That's when the function starts as sexual reproduction

Now the function the male produces is testosterone
Which is a hormone like females produce estrogene and progesterone
And when the sperm finally reaches the ova and the journey's over
It becomes a zygote and waits 'till it's nine months older
As it waits in the placenta it begins to grow a nose,toes
Be careful though cause toxins can ruin the growth

DNA, deciding to never agitate or detonate
Holding all of your fates but wait
It's the double helix, lifes remix

Deoxyribonucleic acid

Watson and Crick mastered
You're flabberghasted

DNA, the instructions for making a protein
Several amino acids one of them is named proline
46 chromosomes, pairs 23
DNA has a codon, sequence of it is 3

Some mistake chromosomes or common mistake
DNA copies itself we call it replicate

Each chromosomes has 100's or thousands of genes
Each gene codes for a particular protein

Each of the genes has a different fusion, some is fused to music others computers
