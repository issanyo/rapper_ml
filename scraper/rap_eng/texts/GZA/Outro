[Intro: La the Darkman]

Kill you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic - money, bitches, land and lessons

Running through Medina wit the Glock plastic
Rotten fruit, Black Je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose

Define rhymers, the question and the answer
The DJ and the dancers, check
