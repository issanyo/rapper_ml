[Hook: GZA]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 1: GZA]
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the Frisbee, Digi they Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger {*echoes*}

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2: GZA]
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: GZA]
Breaker breaker one nine
Breaker breaker one nine
