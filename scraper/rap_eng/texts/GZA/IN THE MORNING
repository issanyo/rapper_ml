[Spoken Word: GZA]
I wake to the sound of the alarm clock ringing
Squirrels leave the burrows, early birds are singing
Just coming out of a dream state, awake
Visions fade, I think new thoughts and meditate
I open the curtains and pull back the drapes
A beautiful blue sky reflecting off a lake
Eyes fixated on the amazing view
The windows to my soul I am gazing through
The sun has risen in the east
