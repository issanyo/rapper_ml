I've seen a kid
One night out at the spot
He had a Wu-Tang logo on his face
And just... a tattoo THIS big
And a whole bunch of other shit carved on it
You don't see that often, I mean
I mean I've never seen a, G-Unit logo
On someone's face, or arm, or...
Y'know; not sayin that there isn't
But umm...
I would say it's sort of like a cult following
Y'know but we're just regular people
I mean, I look
I look at myself as a regular person
