[Verse 1]
We invaded Mars in parachutes
Size of Colosseums
Scale had to find the attributes
Whispers of space left over
From the moment of creation, down to the deaths of supernovas
A million light years away
The thermometer
Much differently like our neighbor
The Andromeda
Hydrogen gas cooled down and started forming
Clusters of stars that we begin swarming
Start a chemical chain and read it like a clock
And, if you can tell time, it's a beautiful thing to watch
By measuring the brightness of a star
According to the hydrogen burning in the core, you see the lightness
I am made up of layers, extreme pressure
Tectonic activity from such conveyors
A big ball of melted metal
99% percent of the planet explored on such a level

Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts

[Verse 2]
The dark like a rocket, many miles per hour
Global warming threatening MCs for power
Strictly hell fire, the ice caps melt
Oxygen, water, and food for thought is dealt
Space is so vast like a puck on ice
I glide across the track and never think twice
A little energy goes a long way
Electrically-charged, I move so fast, a year is one day
Deep-space quest to leave Earth
Away from the force that has shaped up all our lives since birth
Without Hip-Hop I'm like a fish out of water
Flappin' instead of rappin' and my days are shorter
The absence of sound weakens my muscles
The beauty of the divine art makes me hustle
Delivering hell storms of rap articles
Well-planned, detailed, intricate, methodical

[Hook]
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts

[Outro]
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero
All engines running
Permit liftoff
We have liftoff at 11:22AM Eastern Standard Time
