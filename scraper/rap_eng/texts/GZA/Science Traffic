[Hook]
If we talkin' rocks then let's talk metallic
Metamorphic, cementation, and compaction
If we talkin rocks then lets talk organic
Sandstone, coal, and that inorganic
Bioclast, foliation, and that granite
I can tell you something bout an aphinatic
It's very rare plus i heard it's so volcanic
To tell the truth i've never been a rock fanatic

[Verse]
I'm talkin' bout them rocks you can't imagine
That metamorphic rock with the streak sctratchin'
The way it be erodin' you would think its magic
And this a easy A cause they got me rappin
And shout out to miss ware cause she made it happen
And when I'm done with this it be a science anthem
That luster on the rock a have your eyes glancin'
When it turn to cleavage it be so fancy
That layered up appearance yea that foliation
But when they glued together then that's cementation
Composition, solidification
There's a whole rock variation

[Hook]
