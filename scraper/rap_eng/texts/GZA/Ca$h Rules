[Curren$y]
No shit, of course Mr. Where the Cash At was going to rap on this
Young Money, Cash Money, Fly Society
Curren$y the hot spitter

Started out on the good side and shook to the hood side
That's where all the crooks reside
And whereever there's crooks, there's crime
Wherever there's crime there's cash
And wherever there's cash, there's I
Anywhere there's I there's my guys of society of people that's all Fly
Both niggas and bitches on the dash for the riches
Any place that I walk in, I make a grand entrance
Classic image, you've got to admit it
It's no wonder that I get all of the attention from all of the women
But these hoes slow though so I make them stay their distance
They try to figure out what keeps my clock ticking
Walk into an office meeting with my watch hidden
Not because I'm scared of getting robbed, but I don't want to be offensive to the executives in here
I got more money than them and they're supposed to be the ones with good jobs
Hot spitter, that nigga, I'm a hood star
'83 Cut, dog, that's my favorite hood car
Corner Pocket, uptown, that was my favorite hood bar
Pass me that chopper, I'll show you what it's good for

[Remy Ma]
Cash rules everything around me
I heard motherfuckers telling niggas that they found me
But how is that possible when you ain't know where Ra be?
Plus y'all niggas hot I tell you stay the fuck around me
I be puffing purple but sometimes I blow that brown weed
Straight from Jamacia, rolled in papers, smuggled in bounty
Getting money, bitch, dollar dollar bill, yeah I got a live crew that's dying to kill you
Niggas feel my New York slang like they feel Ma, you know what I mean?
Fuck outta here, son, I spit [?]
Pull back a hollow in this point, you gotta chill, god
Enough of that [?], this week I'll put this burner in your grill, pa
Remy Ma, the queen of NY, she's so nice
AKA, the Bronx savior, Jesus Christ
[?] so she don't like, whatever they wish on me come back to them thrice
Fuck your dead mother, bitch, and your kid is a bastard
I'm just here for Curren$y, so tell me where the cash at
Money controls all that's in my circumference
Cash rules everything around me, in other words
