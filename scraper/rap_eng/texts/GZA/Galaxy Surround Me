[Hook]
Planets spinnin all around me
Galaxy Surround me
It's astronomy

[Verse 1]
Jupiter's a gassy planet, along with Saturn
Ask me how I know? I follow the stars pattern
Turned around Saturn and ended up on Mars
And the surface of the planet was cold like these bars
Standing on Mars, my hands started to freeze
Cause the surface temperature was minus 63 degrees
Left the cold in my soul on a quest to get heated
Swerved around the zodiac and ended up Venus

[Verse 2]
Bright as the phoenix, the temperatures so hot
I'm wildin out a lot
Volcanoes is all it's got
Strapped on my oxygen, to avoid the carbon
Dioxide Im getting dehy-
Drated, so I waited, a minute I contemplated
My patience was getting faded, from this journey I created

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
Hesitate on a planet that don’t count – PLUTO
Other schools like that planet -- don’t count cause YOU KNOW I'm
Shining like a diamond flying to the planet next to me
Closest to the sun so it means that I'm on Mercury
Certainly, I'm bout fly to Neptune
Mad moons, then it hit me with the dark blue…
Color
I don’t shudder
When I see the stormy weather. But its whatever..
When I'm chillin on uranus - PAUSE
Tilted downward dog
Been to all the planets so here our last search
Blue seas and pollution we're talkn about EARTH!
