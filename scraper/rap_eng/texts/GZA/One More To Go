"5...4...3...2...1...0"
*explosion*

[Inspectah Deck]
Yea, this is the poisonous, venomous
Killa bee, queen bee connection
Live and direct
Shaolin, BK, QB, Boogie Down, wherever you found

Yo, yo, Deadly Venom is how we end em
Mask avenge em, no friend of him
Bend em in half for entering
My camaraderie move like tight security
Known to tear the club up plus the after party
On the battlefield catch a body
With no fair warning, my queen bee connect swarm on em
Primate, hold your mic straight before you challenge me
You lightweight and only force me to cause casualty
Battery packs catch match mines with the solar powered
They get over powered
Shower with rhymes just like white lines of powder
Feel the realness from being solo with this crowner

[Finesse of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, This time we takin no shorts for sure
Comin through, smashing motherfuckers to floor
Whoever wanted war, yo, bring it
If you got the sword, I'ma swing it
Slither back to the pit when my phone started ringin
Yo, Come here, what's up, niggas 'bout to get stuck
Niggas runnin through the chamber they ain't givin a fuck
Cuz I'm deadly, I'ma set the pace like a medley
Relay, who could match the venom on the replay

[J-Boo of Deadly Venoms]
Aiyyo, the bitch nice and catch crack like dice
Give em a double order of manslaughter on the tape recorder
Fuck the law and order, tape muffled and distorted
All you heard was murderous shots, the rest was pre-recorded
The jury voted, I'm a free venom, hitting niggas with the momentum
Even villains wanna get up in em
The feeling's devious from the breathious
The way we leavin this is sure to make snakes hiss

[Method Man]
It be I, the most high, fly robin fly
Keep a close eye on Johnny 5, I'll be comin live
From New York, it's Saturday Night
So it's only right, I step to the phony types
See em at the party actin hard, but they hardly a threat to the vet
Once you start me, no stoppin, no pardon me
No coppin a plea, I beat you in the head, third degree
What's the science, the 411, can't do me none
Still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my brother's ghetto
Never say die and never settle
For anything less than what the devil possess
I'm like MOP to the death
Now who is Johnny Blaze, Mr. Meth
Motherfuckers

[Chorus: Finesse of Deadly Venoms, (Cappadonna)]
Hittin fever, come with the raw
Deadly Venom with the Wu, no more to come, now what is left to do
(Ghetto collaborations, such a deadly combination
Face to face, Shaking your earth, rocking your nation)

[Champ MC of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, Sons of bitches rollin with the devious Clan
I got a master plan that'll blast your man
Getting lyrical, pumping the venom deep in your mental
Like a pencil all in your vein, killin your spiritual
The original, fishing yall, rolling with a bunch of criminals
Street gunner, Venom strike like thunder
This some shit that'll stop your hunger
Ready for war, like me let you get a taste of the raw
Comin through with the Clan so you won't get far
Battles and scars, all respect due to the gods
And my queen killa bees just collecting that cheese
Overseas, gettin ready for the year 2G, DVs

(Poison Clan rocks the world)

[Cappadonna]
(The Pillage!!)
Yo, I'm a great commodity, foresee me
The unchained magnetic
T release mine, fuck y'all, piece mine together
To the third power, hit y'all like the Mayflower Scandal
Slash three felonies to be the one six vandal
From Park Hill, Shaolin put the work in
From dusk do us dawn, Lebanon Don
Don't sleep on the adversary
Mental niggas stalk y'all out on the ferry
You got trapped in between pillage
And the venoms, cherry heads are minimum

[N-Tyce of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, projects of elimination
We jack some like Rhythm Nations
Got your hard speed like we drag racing
We lab replacing, but tried to avoid a confrontation
You kind of mixed up like Tiger Woods with that combination
I ain't called no names, here's a hint
Niggas with no names, antique things, gold chains
Do admire the visual, 'bout the coolest Carolina
Individual, Everything digital, like Bobby
I'm loving all them kung-fu flicks, poison the ivy
My crew be known to run through cliques, but fast in a hurry
We I smash, leave your vision blurry
Tryin to make the bill like Murray

[Chorus]

[J-Boo of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, on the french kiss, sour than blood, hotter than piss
You ventriliquist talkin out your ass like this
Cuz I insist that you don't wanna show the tape of the hit
I told yall, I crush yall on the tape like Kane
You tweaky trick, wanna violate, great, Wu and Venom annihilate
Don't hesitate to push the rhymes like weight
To shank Jakes

[Street Life]
Yo, PLO, when the guns blow, you'se a no show, homo
Holding like a scarecrow with no dough
Street pro's move through the metro
Rapidly my faculty quick to blow the boost out your battery
My african queen bees is backing me, shutting down your salary
J-Boo twist another Daquiri, fifty steamboat float
Flow on this scenario, hydro thoughts lick off like a callico

[Finesse of Deadly Venoms]
Let's get it on, mic's get blown when you step into my zone
Heads get flown for trying to clone
Now take that, now you wanna go on
So go on, baby pa, hold on, while I flow on
Keep it tight, rip all sides to a square
You ain't seen no thugs like these nowhere
I swear, you wanna test me, how can it be
Rollin with the Fam, Wu-Tang, DVs

[GZA]
Yo, I dead MC's with this poisonous venom
Return and send em, wack niggas is in em
The secretly analyzed, this shit is live
I see the allies trying to stalk the bee hive
Forgot the deadly stinging was major bell ringing
Too strong for niggas with eyes closed and swinging
Make your point, spot your target and zoom in
Before its too late, saw the snake through his hand shake
Aiming your darts at a clique you can't handle
Attack with the paint stones and travel on camel
A warm sigh as you cross the barrier
But my storm side, will destroy your area

[Chorus x2]

(Poison Clan rocks the world
Poison Clan rocks the world)
