[Intro - J-Hi (Mad Science Guy)]
Dropping mad science on ya, nature caught breathless
Sounds so wavy, we eat quantum mechanics for breakfast

Y'all think you're sublime, all hot like a hero
We'll deposit your rhymes, down to absolute zero.

Let's ignite this battle, like that burner named Bunsen,
So hot to make fragile a molten metal even tungsten.

You've got no resistance, like a superconductor,
Like we're ballin' you out, in that famed park, Rucker.

[Fly Boy Kaira]
Y'all ain't about this life, that pseudoscience you rhyming
These bars are so sharp, they'll cut through a diamond

I'll put some pep in your step, like taurine and caffeine,
Our rhymes are so sharp, they could slice sheets of graphene

[Gambian Soul] [Translated from Wolof]
Music, Music is for some people
Science, but science is for everyone
My science and your science .... my science and your science
I don't see what I would exchange science with
You're the one who lets me know what I am and who I became
Thanks to the ones who "discovered" science

[Fly Boy Kaira]
If you want a solid, you gotta freeze it
If you want a liquid, you gotta melt it
If you want a gas, you gotta boil it
Yeah, that's called evaporation

Melting, heat in, that's endothermic,
Freezing, heat out, that's exothermic
Imaginable, but opposite in sign
Gas to liquid, that's condensation
Liquid to gas, that's evaporation
Yeah, it all depends on the solution,
For example, when I entered this nation,
Sweat on my forehead, looks like condensation,
The cold chill on my feet, like summertime ices
Trust me when I told you it wasn't too sweet
If you can't take the Heat, get out the kitchen, 'cuz it burns
ELLIS Prep, we the champs, (but you could call us) spurs

If you want a solid, you gotta freeze it
If you want a liquid, you gotta melt it
If you want a gas, you gotta boil it
Yeah, that's called evaporation

[Outro - J-Hi (Mad Science Guy)]
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now tissues and organs here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organ system's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organism's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now 7 billion humans here

I done keep track of organelles
Nucleus -- cell's brain, DNA, lots of control
Now it wants to make proteins on its own
Engineering all day, that's the ribosome
Now getting tired, where's the energy at?
See mitochondria, get some ATPs out
More organelles here, now I gotta go
Out the cell membrane, small molecules can flow
'Cuz we...

Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now tissues and organs here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organ system's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organism's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now 7 billion humans here
