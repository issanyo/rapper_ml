[Verse 1 - Ryan Rivera]

When a man and woman make love in a bed or sofa
And then the sperm have a journey just to try to reach the ova
Then when it enters the cervix, the sperm start running
That's when the function starts: that's sexual reproduction

Now the function the male produces is testosterone
Which is a hormone like females produce estrogene and progesterone
And when the sperm finally reaches the ova and the journey's over
It becomes a zygote and waits 'till it's nine months older
