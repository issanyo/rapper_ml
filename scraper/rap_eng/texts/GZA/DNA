What can I say, we wouldn’t be here today, if the old school didn’t pave the way

You can’t hang....
We the new wu-tang
Check out our lyrical slang as we begin

Todays Topic.... DNA
Genetic makeup of every living thing

Its a code .... broken up in sections
Plus carrying ..... all lifes instructions
Implicit construction..... the master key
The thing that makes me a dope MC

DNA ---
The physical
The mental
Other traits
Eventually mutate
To create to create to createeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

We’re Changing through time
Life track Remix
Wind and unwind
DNA double helix

Remix these strands
To rebuild our hands
Each time a new brand
Earth’ll never get bland

My rhymes make or break you.. hope you feel this
Competition was all dudes so we came to steal this

Abnormal Cell division is what causes cancer
Burning up the competition I’m not even a Cancer
Cells dividing
Like dreams divided
Tryna reach our goals
So we keep on striving

Adenine
Thymine
Cytosine
Guanine
Base pairs
They pair
Like we are
Rhymin’

Like beats come together to create a rhythm
Parts of DNA form a living organism

We used deoxyribonucleic acid
As we mastered the ways to create this classic
Your losing to 3 girls i guess its kinda tragic

I’m different like 2 chainz
Because i mutated
DNA has 2 chains
You see how that’s related

If you didn’t get it
You may be dumb
Don't mess with me
I'm not the one
Once i start
No one can stop me
Like DNA unwinds so it can be copied

During DNA replication
DNA unwinds so it can be replicated
Changing rearranging , cell mutation
They also unwind
To instruct the making
Of essential components
Of a cell
This crew is gonna win
Can't you tell

Hold Up Dj Kill That Beat

I got something I wanna spit accepella
Im raps cinderella
Im raps recreation
Told my team put that beat on probation
I must be some type of mutation
Because I developed a trait that made me the best in the nation
These fake rappers claiming they gon kill but I'm immune by adaptation
Natural selection survival of the fittest
Just remember mother nature screaming anybody can get it
Im the reproduction of a trait chosen to persist
You can't resist
A flow that you craving like this
I'm not even a rapper but im killing these un-camo-flauged writers
I'm the greatest
That's a topic that been debated and contemplated
If you ain't got a trait we need you're joining the extincted
Only the best of the best are the ones who stay alive
You ain't meant to survive
If you can't "set fire to the rain"
You won't see another day
If you got short legs how you gonna run when you the prey (talking)
I'mma beast emerging from her cage
Stepping outta her shell
Shyness ain't a trait that mutates in this world
Absorb the flow
Change it up
Martin Tommy Gina y'all know wassup
Mutation the act of being altered or rearranged
Nature's a fighter standing up for some change
Only the strong survive
Only God knows why
A sudden change in inheritable characteristics
I'm the purple apple who decided to be different
Darwin came to the realization
Each beak had its own modification
He called this evaluation
Something every generation is doing
It's amusing like the dream that I'm persuing
Combining science with music
It's my passion with my have to
Science rap battles
With my knowledge I'm building castles
Like I was meant to

Hold Up wait a minute, Ya thought we was finished?

A mistake in Dna causes things to transfigure
Your team will do it big
But i grantee will do it bigger
That something to consider
Maybe the damages from environmental assets
Gave me the power to mutate this classic
It something tragic
Ultraviolet Light
Nuclear Radiation
Cause change in DNA bases
Call this a mutation
Somethings always changing
Mutates my vocal cords
Now im spiting bars
I know we not talking extraterrestrial
But im a shooting star
When a base pairs with the wrong base
It cause things to mutate
And allows the difference we hide with in
To escape
Even though society don't want us to be different
Nature had a different vision

Mutation, celebration
Changing our relations
Genes are inherited
Momma can tell that we related

These children act like age is anything but just a number
They looking like a camry and I’m rollin in a hummer
