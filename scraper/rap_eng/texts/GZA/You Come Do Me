(Verse 1: Tiger)
Listen to our music altogether
You don't need keep it on so check it yourself to your musician shake it up
Shake it down when you're grounded for the month
Trying to get you too
Stay awake till you do want it, you know me?
Stay out of control, not of your own business
Listen up to your mouth
Keep listen up to your mouth leaving through the door slam thor
Not shall be do it for me and you are a pretty romantic shown
Perfectly our mentality problems
Better off quickly you'll come do me
I'll get ya back later when you're so screaming as tooth runtime
Punchline, bloodline, listen up your music
Kitty kitty cat was pretty pretty awesome
Self-destruct the mat when you'll call you up either right now looks like a girls right
Draw me out like cow blood and chocolate
Take our planets of the moon, hee-ya!
See you in later, what do you think
Liar? Don't call me a liar
I'm sorry for asking you in later
Rushed me blood rushed out of our streets
Look likes [?] 2Pac starring of the film Juice
Look, the robots gone, huh?
No ones caught out, huh?
Look out of my sisters of all out of you
Tell me the truth no ones looking about the streets of masters
Come do me, just me and you, baby
Listen to your own music to call you out of your schools
That's nice and pretty, not of your own business see you too
Get out of here right now
But you can't stay with me?
Prepare, stressed, crying, screaming, and rude to me
And you're so disgusting, horrid, stupid, and nightmare

[Bridge]
Listen, madam, you come do me
Listen, baby, you come do me

(Verse 2: Tiger)
Oh yeah? You come do me, too
Or I come do you, too
My friend Sam Fuel, it is
Long time ago, all of us, all of you to do with it

[Bridge]
