[Verse 1: GZA]
Before space and time, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
It was massive energy and it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space of every special place with information encased
Literally, a beginning
This cosmic clock was ticking and allowed space to flow while it was spinning
Everything we see around us
The sun, the moon, the stars, millions of worlds that astound us
The universe inside is hard to fathom
It was composed in a region small as a single atom
Less than one trillionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic but on a macro level within
Unfurling this swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanding beyond comprehension
Within a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size very unstable
In time it would come with a periodic table

[Verse 2: GZA]
You see, space was expanding faster than light speed
It moving at the rate only thought can exceed
A picosecond after the Big Bang
Music of the spheres before the ears, the Universe is now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of a second later 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since the time of birth
Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was mixing within the batter
But mass and energy interchangeable
Convert those particles rearrange-able
Matter and anti-matter, the archrival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there is life and breath there's one remaining left
