The force of gravity is the force that the earth, moon, or any other large object attracts another object towards itself

I defy gravity
I am stronger than any force
I am Brooklyn

Gravity, Why you wanna be mad at me?
Like 9.803 pulling down at me
Meters per second squared
Acceleration
I’m pushing back up (you know thats called) determination

Gravity wanted to battle said he had forces
Of course I took the battle had to show him who the boss is
Now I’ll start to show you what the three newtons laws is
Move in line, stay in a line till a force is on it

Newton found gravity when an apple fell from a tree
The battle is over, in physics class i learned your history
Give me a minute let me describe Acceleration
Its the rate that an object suddenly-- changes motion
Gotta give it time-- seconds, minutes, hours
Let me break it down, I’m stronger than Austin Powers

Gravity ain't got nothin on me or my force
You know we from Brooklyn so we holdin it down of course
I got a Hypothesis-- an educational guess
Who winning this rap battle, y’all know who is the best
At the end of the day we putting gravity to a test
Hope my hypothesis is nothing but correct

Gravity-- are you still mad at me
You know Newton’s law told you that
You can’t handle me
Your actions of holding me down are battling with the constant force of energy
