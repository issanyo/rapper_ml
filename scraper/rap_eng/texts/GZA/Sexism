RodiMiS
Biting facts of being
Woman mans favorite being
Hate it or Love it
Her voice on percussion
No other, Doo Wop, Stop understand my women
Showing realism
Miseducation
Young'n can't process the sayin'
So I'mma delay it
Moved on to another basic, reality
Oh Zion, Yea I protect that like The Matrix
I say this
Move on forward as I take it
Take maybe um, oh Doo Wop
Hell yea, You got that right there
Have to understand I'm prepared
Aye yo, Dawg, this is a looped intro
So, I hope you know, that I gotta go but um
Oh there it goes

[LOOP]

GeniuZ
Femme Fatale, high pitch voice possible
Green light a way to run away from tracks unstoppable
Lock and load when I drop a flow
Black Holes for these void rappers like space or dominoes
When Miseducation still made my honor roll
Model pot of gold
Model everything is everything so
Eyes of windows to the soul
And the hills have eyes
She got open windows
(Ugh) Life lessons to a surrogate Zion
Picture life as a Nikon
Turned to an icon
I tell her right on
Her music says right on?
If I could do it, You could be the one I shine on
So, ready or not, here I come fame I'll find you
Switching animated channels
Tryna find the right tunes
Way too, Good to be true
Since I can't take my eyes off of you
(it's like ugh)
