[Verse 1: Work]

This concept is applied to all lives
We stride times distance
Ill let you be a witness to the prize
Be a man, understand
You comprehending this is vital, work = FD
The equation for survival;
Your only rival is friction don’t get caught up in the drag
So you better prepare cuz obstacles fight back
When you get knocked down though don’t please don’t cry
Just get up and apply more force next time
One day I was dreaming with a really strong hope
That I’ll make it but to make it takes more than just believing
These resistance slash demons were kinda holding me back
And I let’em but the simple way to get me on track was
Force times displace, Is work no debate
I’ll take that concept apply it to my mistakes
And now I’m progressing a natural Rap Genius
And I’ma get an A if I see this on the regent

[Hook]

Here’s the lesson, I know it kinda hurts but if you truly want to work than there must be progression cause
FD=W the rule and the unit measurement for the product is called joules, Cool
I did the work I’ma try to let it flow the more people I know kinetic energy grows so
I’ma go to work convert all of my potential, and as my speed increases then I’ma grow exponential

[Verse 2: Kinetic Energy]

The work has been applied if my equations are correct
The energy that is left creates a domino effect
My mass is what I’m bringing to the table underestimate
You’ll wish that you had brought a bigger dinner plate
Separate me from the fakes let me educate
Velocity’s my following and that’s I’ma generate
Through these shows and gigs and just overcoming all the friction
To the point where friction doesn’t even make a difference
I feed my interest with the laws of physics
When m and v multiply the picture is painted vivid
The work was just something that got me inside the door
Now we, squaring the v and it’s exponentially more
I got a lot in store the v’s
Cuz I’m progressin’ my m
And when you multiply them
There’s no end to the kinetic energy
You better be prepared
Cause I’m fillin’ you up with envy with my ½ m v2

Here’s the lesson, I know it kinda hurts but if you truly want to work than there must be progression cause
FD=W the tool and the unit measurement for the product is called joules, Cool
I did the work I’ma try to let it flow the more people I know kinetic energy grows so
I’ma go to work convert all of my potential, and as my speed increases then I’ma grow exponential
