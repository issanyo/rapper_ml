[Verse 1]
Can you feel the breeze?
Because you’re talking loud, I’m talking low for me
Can you touch my face?
And we gon leave the memories outside in place
I woke up one day
Thinkin bout this earth was just a book and gameplay
I guess I took my chance
I guess I took my chance
(It’s all about her)

[Chrous]
I saw the ocean when I saw you
In my sky, that’s where I climb so high to see you
(It’s all about her)
Can you see the words rolling off my tongue?
You’ve got the touch baby cause you’re the one
I can taste the smoke rollin off your lips
I inhale, see the stars and then I smell your kiss
Show me, show me your galaxy
(It’s all about her)

[Verse 2]
You dreamt me up, you put me here
Behind your eyes, inside your mind
I hear your thoughts, you took me there
I tend to stare in your eyes
They’re black as night, when they roll on by
Our bodies shine while our souls ignite
Follow me and my broken lead and we’ll paint the sky

[Chorus]
I saw the ocean when I saw you
In my sky, that’s where I climb so high to see you
(It’s all about her)
Can you see the words rolling off my tongue?
You’ve got the touch baby cause you’re the one
I can taste the smoke rollin off your lips
I inhale, see the stars and then I smell your kiss
Show me, show me your galaxy
(It’s all about her)

[Verse 3 (Jaden Smith)]
I hate the fact you smoke cigarettes
But girl let’s just stick to kissing
And work out our differences
‘Cause girl I’ve been listening to your problems
And lately I do not got none
And girl I’ll stop when the cops come if they ever do
Let’s get back to the residue
Let’s get back to the cuddling
Let’s get back to the huddle
And let’s get back to that puddle
When Jaden was rappin subtle
We went to blast in a shuttle
Off out into space and then bury lies with a shovel
Like am I really that lost? That off in my head
I used to kickflip in my Kostons now rap awesome instead
Throw a ketchup bottle at you
That’s some freaking flying sauces
And go to Mars and show you flying saucers
Man we gotta off of this
We don’t have no parents, all the MSFTS are foster kids
And we don’t have no friends
Cause all you fakies and narcissists
A group of individuals, we kinda like sausages
Homie I’m off of this, what I will do is offer this
Intellect, my extension to enter that
Buy a Ralph Lauren vintage deck without a sending check
In a sec I’m bout to intersect in what you sayin
So I could show the whole world what my penmanship
I ain’t finished yet
Windows tinted, yeah I like to look at all the women
Get hot, when the sun is on I’m summer sun in summer
Autumn, winter, spring
Summer, autumn, winter, spring
Some would like to hear me sing
I’ll buy you diamond rings and store them in my dreams
And we were all a part of one, forgot our teams
And had a phone that never rings
Love that freakin phone
