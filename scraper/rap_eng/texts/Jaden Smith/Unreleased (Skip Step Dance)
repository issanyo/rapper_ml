[Intro]
Skip Step Dance
Skip Step Dance

[Hook]
Tequila and Kombucha in my left hand
I can do it better than the next man
Not even a question
I just guess they can't get the message

[Verse 1]
She said we [?] you should pull up
She said we at one up you should pull up
She said we should pull up we at Up N' Down
I told her when I pull up Imma skip step dance
Got the diamonds dancing on me
Pants hanging low
Grab it when I work
Damn you ain't give em boys a chance
Walk up in the spot
In the restaurant, counting rubber-bands
Fuck a reservation they know who I am
In my city I’m the man
Imma tat Calabasas on my hand just so they can understand
Man I really hate everyone in Hollywood
But I give a fuck about revenge when I skip step dance

[Hook]
Tequila and Kombucha in my left hand
That was not a fact I was flexing
Girl who the fuck you texting
Better be your mother or your best friend

[Verse 2]
Baby you a star textin'
I wasn’t sleeping in the club I was resting
This is not the Western
But it isn’t worth addressing
She said we at one up you should pull up
I say I’m at the Met you should pull up
Ever seen a joker flexing with his hood up?
You gone see it when I [?] and I skip step dance
Counting cash man, that’s good enough
Got the guap, better pull it up
Boutta hit em with the [?]
When I [?] imma skip step dance
