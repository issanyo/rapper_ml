[Verse 1]
Girl this stuff is ugly
Come right here and love me
Put your cell phone down and don’t put nothing above me
Accept your sexy body, cause I know you wanna touch me
Asking all these questions, he don’t have his license, does he?
Age is just a number, and summer's just a season
See your knees so weak and you don’t even have a reason
Well girl we’ll stop that shaking
Wait until the evening and I'll really give you something to believe in
Girl why are you grieving
Give you a new meaning
Get right in between those precious things that’s in your jeans
Girl how would you know? We’re only teens
Love is something that we only knowing in our dreams
All I really know that baby girl is that it seems
Like we’re having lots of fun and that we make a perfect team
Touching on your body, girl you acting like a fiend
I'mma be your bestest friend that satisfies all of your needs
So just love me like you do

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Love me like you do, love me like you do, like you do
Hold me tight and don’t let go
What am I to do?
When you love me like you do, like you do
Hold me tight and don’t let go

[Verse 2]
I'm here to give you what you need
I can I can give you give you give you what you need
We can walk the park or we can climb up in some trees
Sit you in the shade while we listen to the breeze
Or I'll take you to the movies where they got reclining seats
Or we can take the car to your apartment up the street
If you want to get it started cause my heart is what you need
And it's really up to you there baby girl and that’s for me
Put my hand up on your waist and let you take the lead
As long as I ain't free, as long as I can breathe
As long as you are you, and I can just be me
And when we come together it's like we drowning in some seas
Girl we 'bout to make it happen like you just wouldn't believe
All the stuff that you could lose and you can gain
Girl you got me crazy when you whispering my name
So come right over here and let make you go insane
And I hope you fall in love with all this stuff that I be saying
Girl just love me like you do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I would ask...
Is you complete your only task
Try to make this last
Girl you know this love could be so vast
As I run my fingers on your back
I know I'm moving fast
Don’t worry bout them kids that’s talking trash
Girl just take my hand
And we’ll forget about the past
Kissing on your neck
Girl I love it when you laugh
And I got you on a roll like we done learn this stuff in class
So just love me like you do

[Hook 2X]
