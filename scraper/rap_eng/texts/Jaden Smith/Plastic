Man, we just got banned from the club

Chew the guap, yeah (Yuh)
Don't even talk to me (No, no)
They need to water me (Water)
I need it all for free (All)
Landlines (Landlines), standby (Standby)
Rubber bands, make 'em fly

[Chorus]
Bust down, ran outta plastic (Woo)
Triple backflip, gymnastics (Woo)
Every time I spit, it go Platinum (Woo)
Open up my mouth, all platinum (Woo)
Whip with the wings like Batman (Woo)
Roll around Lower Manhattan (Let's go)
Black teeth (Black teeth)

[Verse]
Woke up one day, I was trappin' (Woah)
I give a fuck 'bout the fashion (Woah)
Look at they stupid reaction (Woah)
Cameras roll and it's action (Woah)
I do not fuck with the wack shit (No)

I'm a genius, need a patent (Yeah)
I'ma need a sexy mamacita sippin' margaritas in the mansion (Woo)
I need everyone's attention (Woo)
I keep the- with extensions (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

Hit me up, then it gettin' popped off (Let's go)
We got a whole different exit (Go)
And we got a different entrance (Go)
Case you run into them haterade sippin' niggas with them bad intentions (Go)
Burning white picket fences (Go)
They know the vision is heaven-sent
I got their secrets with factual evidence, yeah (Let's go)
She want the ring and the bling and the valuable things
In the vault with dead presidents, oh (Let's go)
I left it all in the sentiment (Go)
Who knew that gossip was venomous?
They got lost inside of fetishes (Fetish)
Go and crush it with the records
The flow a fossil, I'm ahead of 'em (Go)
It's so impossible, I'm never runnin'
Jumpin' obstacles and making letters up (Letters up)
The doctor said my head is messing up (Messing up)
He gave me pills to pop, I never get enough (Get enough)
Man, he know too much, its time to set him up (Go)
We got them tapped calls on the regular

Roll around Lower Manhattan (Let's go)
Black teeth (Black teeth)
