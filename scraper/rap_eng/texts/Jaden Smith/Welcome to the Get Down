[Intro]
"This ain't Disney Land, this is the Bronx!
Either you be strong or you be gone!"

[Verse]
Wanna see some rubbish?
I'm undercover at train yards and lovin' it
I'm tryna think what lady paint the covenant
To find a wall to bomb, the whole Bronx is crumblin'
We should do it on Charlotte just for the fun of it
And the name is Rumi if you was wonderin'
Alien in a top hat, I'm hoverin'
And I'm chillin' with Mylene
We guzzlin' holy water, it's hotter than hell
Don't let the summer in
Man you lookin' at me like you impressed now
B-boy steez with the fresh style
Shaolin Fantastic's on the disc, and you like
"What's this kid?" Welcome to the Get Down
Hope you're ready to get down
Shaolin Fantastic's on the disc, and you like
"What's this kid?" Welcome to the Get Down
(Welcome to the Get Down...)
