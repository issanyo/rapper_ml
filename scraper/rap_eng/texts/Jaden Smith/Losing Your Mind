Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you

[Verse 1: Raury]
You know I'm always kicking fly shit and the streets recognize
We can vibe-vibe on the cloud so high
To the constellations but I ain't a sci-fi kid
I used to be a quiet kid, the whole world in front of me
Kaleidoscope eyes in fact, a telescope's eyesight
Can't reveal the things I wanna see
I'm a vision-vision-vision-visionary
Colors-colors-colors-colors vary
Swear I was abducted by them aliens
I can see the 2086, lady miss, please
Baby girl ease down
Tryna find the one, thinkin' it's me
Swag that I breathe
It's halitosis, I cannot control it
I'm just goin' through the motion
Hoppin' in my UFO like

[Hook]
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Hmm where's all the rap visionaries
Man this day and age numb and it's gettin' scary
On a train from London, I'm going straight to Paris, aye [Perrier]
And I'm running from these cats like we Tom and Jerry
Hope-hope-hope for intelligence
I'm wishin' hard for these far away visions
Elevate the mind state, that's my only mission
In the game that's been the same ever since the beginnin'
Look yo that's just how I was taught
Wonder if it would be different if I came from the Bronx
Growin' up with the Furious Five and Crash Daze and Dizzy and them
'77 it's back in the day
Just know you need the passion to play
And have the mic in your hand when you're with Flash and he say

[Hook]
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you

[Bridge: Raury + Jaden Smith]
Used to spray paint as I skated alone
(Use the spray paint when I'm skatin' alone)
Cops in my yard, ain't nobody home
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ain't no one home
(Hey you)
Used to spray paint as I skated alone
(Use the spray paint when I'm skatin' alone)
Cops in my yard, ain't nobody home
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ain't no one home

[Hook]
Hey you (let's go)
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing
You're losing your mind
Hey you

[Verse 3: Raury]
Get it in different, girls in my Hoover
Inside peanut butter, ain't nothin' smoother
I can make you move to a beat you ain't used to
Ever seen a woke nigga run around with the shooters?
I made dividents, spinning this world in a hula
Here it is, pyramid, sacred math Buddha
Bitch I ain't a lick because I move slick
Got the metal in my pocket, watch the trigger go click
Dip and dash quick, cops on the road
Throw the book at me but I die centerfold
World needs color, world should have known
Look around, all I see is all these black and white souls
All these black and white souls
In my UFO
