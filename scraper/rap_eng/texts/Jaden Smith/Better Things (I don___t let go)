[Intro: Jaden Smith & XXXTentacion]
Yuh, Yeah
We back on the mob shit, you already know what that is
Yuh, true macabre shit, yuh

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
She ahead of me (What?)
Gave her everything (Yuh)
She got better things (Damn)
She got better things (Huh?)
She a Beatles fan (What?)
I'ma let it be (Let it be)
Reject my wedding ring (Woo)
Accept my Hennessy ('Sy)
She got better things (Yuh)

She got better things (Better)
She got better things (Better things)

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl, my head is clean (Yuh)
Got that energy ('Gy)
You remember me? You remember me?
No, she too special (She too special), woo
She on a whole 'nother level
Turn on the TV, man, she on the channel
And she can play the piano, damn, uh (Fuck)
She the freshest, give her the bust down necklace (Necklace)
She gave back the necklace, she told me I'm livin' too reckless, fuck
Fuck, why you ignoring my message? (Uh)
She said "'Cause I'm working and I don't got time to go check it"

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
She ahead of me ('Head of me)
She ahead of me (Hey)
Gave her everything (Woo)
Gave her everything (Yuh)

She got better things (What?)
She got better things (What?)
You was seventeen (Yuh)

We were heavenly (Yuh)
Now she say "You dead to me"

[Verse 2]
Sauce as fuck, I'm verified
And I'm on your thottie mind
But I don't want her, 'cause I got a wife
Playin' with the kitty through the day and night
Playin' with the mind on the beat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Shawty wanna swallow up the meat, oh, I
Hey, yeah

[Hook: XXXTentacion]
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad 'cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside
Sometimes I don't let go (Ayy)
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad 'cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside

[Verse 3: XXXTentacion]
Huh, she gettin' smoked like a bong, hm
Smoked like that song, hm
That's fire, that's my lung, hm
I got the dope in my sock, aw-yuh
She want the crack, not the rock, mhm
I pull up like a-mhm, huh
She pull up, I'm like, "Mhm," huah

[Hook: XXXTentacion]
Sometimes I don't let go
I shine, I shine, now the hate froze
Niggas mad 'cause they all hoes
Watching from the outside

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
She got better things, yuh (Hey)
She got better things (Huh?)
She got better things (What?)
She got better things (What?)

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
Top down leather seats (Oh)
Too many fantasies (Yeah)

Harness my energy (Uh)

And she just let it be (Yeah)
