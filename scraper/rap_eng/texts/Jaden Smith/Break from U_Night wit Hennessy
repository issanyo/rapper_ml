[Break From U]

[Chorus]
I drive through my city
And parts of me that need a break from you
I know that you fallen for me like the devil corrupted you
Look at the nights wit' the Henny you drinking and that’s not you
Now I’m just smoking and driving
The choice is just up to you
We smokin', we driving
We smokin', we driving
We smoke and we drinkin'
We smoke and we drinkin'
We smoke and we drinkin....
The choice is just up to you

[Verse]
The choice is just up to you
You Calling my phone like you always do
Tryna find out what’s wrong with me
You be sensing something
What you do to me?
You wanna know
I know what you doing
I know who been calling
The 4am trolling
The late nights "Im going"
His name was misleading (like woah)
You said that you love him
You said that you need him
I know the whole story
Should I believe it?
The choice is just up to you

[Chorus]
I drive through my city
And parts of me that need a break from you
I know that you fallen for me like the devil corrupted you
Look at the nights wit' the Henny you drinking and that’s not you
Now I’m just smoking and driving
The choice is just up to you
We smokin', we driving
We smokin', we driving
I know im misleading
I know im misleading....
I know im misleading
The choice is just up to you

[Night wit Hennessy: VERSE]
Night wit Hennessy, me and you, it got me thinking
Repetition of thoughts always keep me dreaming
Hearing stories about you
I couldn’t believe it
How did you turn into this person that I end up hating?
It’s cool though...
A part of me needs to be free from your clutch
Another side probably loved you way too much
I ain’t taking bout the rumors
Only facts that I trust
Nah I ain’t waiting for it...
I hear your voicemails and I’m laughing cuz you always wildin
Changing emotions like the devil changing potions
I ain’t gonna stop till you end up cutting all these motions'
Lemme tell you something...
I ain’t gonna call you names like I’m 4 or something
No fighting, no wildin , no stress or nothing
Just gonna move on , drinking suttin...
