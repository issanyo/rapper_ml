[Intro: Together]
[?] says Palace brothers and sisters live forever, bless them

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
We should go to Disney
And we should go to Disney
Ride rides until we're dizzy
Eat way too many churros
There's way too many zeros

[Verse 1: Willow Smith]
And you got me looking, got me looking
I remember first day we were talking
I told you I had a secret, that I would not tell it
You still don't know
But I can walk down the street like my mind don't know
And I can talk to these people like they might not know
But I'm always floating in the clouds
I'm always speaking with the angels, speaking with the E.T's
Extraterrestrials, extra more vegetables, eat, eat your vegetables

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days (only three days)
Oh we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
Baby we should go to Disney
Ride rides until we're dizzy
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
I could tell you three ways, I could tell you three ways

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
There's a couple of our show books on the floor
Pillars of consciousness is opened to page six
And Channel Orange is playing just [?] for us to make conversation
There are crystals in the triangle in front of me
I'm sitting on the floor with my legs crossed and you're sitting on the bed
You're reading Being in Love, love, love
It's like 92 degrees outside
There are white Christmas lights wrapped around two shelves next to the TV in the living room
The Christmas lights are on and the AC is off
Hot box
Ummm...divide that by nine please
