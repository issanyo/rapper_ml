[Verse 1]
I roll with my dawgs
We slip and we fall
We don't listen to y'all
I hit a swisher, we ball, wait look
You just a fraud, wait
You just a mirage, wait
I'm in the garage
I need a massage
I'm cookin' the sauce and I'm 'bout to floss
And I'm 'bout to (flex)
I hear the applause, I'm gettin' them cheques
I heard you just hit the road, Pete Wentz
I guess all this rock and roll shit ainâ€™t a stretch
I'm bout to put Hello Kitty on my neck
Just to show whack rappers how to get it
I slaughtered the beat and I never regret it
I'm signing to Hov just to help with my credit
You get me look, look

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like a trapper
Sometimes I feel like a rapper
I'm in the 6 with my Raptors
But my boy Roy Backwoods
Pull up on me, a disaster
You get them cheques in you head
Independent to the brain
I think I do insane, yeah
Sometimes I feel like a trapper
Sometimes I feel like a rapper
I'm in the 6 with my Raptors
But my boy Roy Backwoods
Pull up on me, a disaster
You get them cheques in you head
Independent to the brain
I think I do insane, yeah

[Verse 2]
You still caught up in the game
I don't need a private plane
I just wanna heal the poverty
When it comes to rap, I'm the anomaly
Put a pretty pendant to a prophecy
Sit at Jon and Vinny's poppin' bottles
We just need to get a Tesla with the throttle
Autopilot 'til tomorrow
Girl you still fed up, don't lie to me
Your body I hit the lottery
I'ma go build me a colony
Speak up I only talk guaponese (ya, ay)
Why can't you wait on the beat, ya
That's just my name in the streets, ya
They call me Jaden the beast, ya

[Bridge]
Hundred grand no misogyny
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me, look
Hundred grand for monogamy
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me
Hundred grand no misogyny
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me
Hundred grand for monogamy
On the gram, you should follow me

[Outro]
Hundred grand, need a hunnid
You was walkin', I was runnin'
Come and get it if you want it
Bought Kombucha in abundance
My baby mama like stunnin'
That was none I was stunnin'
Niggas still runnin' from us
I got 'em going bananas
