[Intro]
Say one, two, three!
(Say three, two, one!)
Cause The Get Down Brothers
Are down to have fun!

[Hook: All]
Shaolin's the DJ that we call conductor
Cause Shaolin Fantastic's a bad mother--
(One, two, three, break!)

[Intro (Continued)]
Yes, y'all! You're now listening to the sound of four greatest orators, and our DJ Shaolin Fantastic cutting the heads off the competition laughing (ha, ha, ha, ha!)

[Verse 1: Justice Smith]
Put your hands up if you wanna get down with The Get Down
Put your hands up, if you wanna get down, say "Get Down Brothers!" (Get Down Brothers!)
Yo, yo, MC Books in the buildin', slipped in cleverly
So dead-i-ly, plus the flow's heavenly
They wanna be the Get Down Brothers but they can never be
Mic controller, got chicks jockin' me steadily

[Verse 2: TJ Brown]
I'm MC Boo, the youngest of the crew
And when I rhyme, I rhyme for real
Said I walked through hell with my gasoline drawers on
(Bronx!) MC's, I'm lethal like poison

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
I'm fly Dizzy-D all the ladies love me
The brothers know I'm down by law
So it started with a crayon, Flash said "play on!"
Next up, Ra, bless the floor

[Verse 4: Skylan Books]
I said they call me King Ra
Hear the fanfare when I enter the cipher
Fly girls follow me like I'm the Pied Piper
Proper preparation prevents piss-poor performances
It's that Get Down Brothers presentation for your enjoyment

[Hook: All]
Shaolin's the DJ that we call conductor
Cause Shaolin Fantastic's a bad mother--

[Bridge]
When the get down brothers (are in the place)
We rock to the beat (with style and grace)
We got the moves (and the verbal gymnastics!)
Cause our DJ's name is Shaolin Fantastic

Get down, (get down!)
Get down, (get down!)
Get down, (get down!)
Get down, (get down!)
"D" is for doin'
"O" is for our crew
"W" is for winning
"N" it's naturally what we do
"D" is for doin'
"O" is for our crew
"W" is for winning
"N" it's naturally what we do

[Turntablism]

[Segue: Herizen Guardiola's "Set Me Free"]
(Come set me--come set me--come set me free)
Make money, money, take money, money!
(Make money, money, take money, money!)
Say "Get down!" (get down!)
Say "Get down!" (get down!)
Say "Get down!" (get down!)
Say "Get down!" (get down!)

[Verse 5: All]
We're the get down brothers
And we're new on the scene
But we're gonna pass the mic
Like a well oiled machine
All pistons are firing
We rappin' and rockin' a rhyme
I pass it to my brother
Cause I know he's on time
(ooh, ooh)
Spin the wheels on the Caddy
Cause we're turnin' all the moves
Pivotal, lyrical, criminal
Books, Ra-Ra, Dizzie, Boo
We rock you to the beat
Like true Bronx kings
We stand united cause we're our DJ's wings

[Ad lib]
We say unity, unity (unity, unity!)
Say unity, unity (unity, unity!)
Get down (get down!)
Get down (get down!)
Get down (get down!)
Get down (get down!)

[Bridge: All]
"D" is for doin'
"O" is for our crew
"W" is for winning
"N" it's naturally what we do
"D" is for doin'
"O" is for our group
"W" is for winning
"N" it's naturally what we do
Get down
