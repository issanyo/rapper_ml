[Intro: Odessa Adlon]
Um I was just watching The Office
That's it

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
You know what to do
Change my taste in music

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Summer's coming to the end
We should know, we should know
Summer's coming to the end
We should know, we should know
Summer's coming to the—
We should know, we should know
Summer's coming to the—
We should—

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Take me to the moon
Take me home with you
You know what to do
I'll find my way to you

[Post-Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Faded in the sky on a limousine ride
I'ma leave home, I'ma be alright
I'ma leave home, I'ma be alright
I'ma leave home, I'ma be alright
Faded in the sky on a limousine ride
I'ma leave home, I'ma be alright
I'ma leave home, I'ma be alright
I left home but I'm not alright no

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Where did we go wrong
I need you in my arms
You were right above the stars
You're all just broken hearts
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I'll see you soon
'Cause I've been on the moon
Girl I float alone in the sky
But that's alright

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Sometimes I don't wanna love you
Can't believe they tried to say it now I rock 'n roll
Got a new whip we gotta go Geronimo
Do it all and you call me Kim Possible
Your boy Jaden's not human, he is an animal
I could go forever, they ain't got the stamina
Fuck security you bring 'em all I can handle 'em
I lost some teeth but baby girl I got some bandages
Think you stressed but damn, think about my management
How about over at the party I prolly fuck the cameras up
Going to jail, nigga forgot you was in Paris
I'm so fucked up, I'm sorry for my parents
They all asked me why you so careless

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
It's cause of the static lights
Paradise, gotta fantasize
I can't survive, Whiskey on the rocks
On the bus, I just wanna hit 'em with all of us
Whiskey on the rocks
Fantasize, a simple paradise, girl fantasize
I can't survive, oh Whiskey on the rocks
On the rise
They don't want me there with all of us (My heart is broken)
They told me I won't go too far in life
