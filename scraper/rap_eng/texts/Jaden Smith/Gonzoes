I am the last one intelligence
The swag comes with elegance
That was blessed upon you
But that's what just you learn from these debts and fondu
I'll handle the bill, but the rest is on you
Jaden is the true, yes I'm on to the next ish
MSFTS, we're so reckless
I'm on a stage, care less what the set list is
Is because you didn't put me on it
And I'mma diss you when you try to put me on it
Said I used to be so sweet, put a cookie on it Jaden
Stop playing games, I'm just playing hockey honest
But I just wanna be snug tight with the girl of my dreams
And continue this love life cause
It took a lot of pain to get here
When this gonna be gone by this time next year
But know the game is a good school
Man, I ain't got no problem, but I'mma be on tour with my..
Sad cause I used to be the bad
And you used to be myâ€¦girl version
And my world is turning upside down
Everybody shut up right now
Somebody pull me up right now
Cause I'm swimming in my sorrows and I just might drown, girl
And my past is graphic, you make my heart sore like some lactic acid
All my friends tell me I'm the best
I don't believe them, but I'm going to the top
And you know that I will never leave them that's the crew there
And I'mma talk about root beer in my songs if I want to
Cos we're at the top Marley, are you here?
No Cause we don't want you here
Chilling with your friends
I haven't seen you in two years
Have fun with Kennedy when you kick it
Before she goes away and doesn't ask me to visit
Have a problem visit
Girl, I'm not gonna see you
But it's really not gonna be different from the past year
Everyone says I'm changing
Gone to my head, I haven't even been famous
Karate Kid is behind this
Diamonds on my neck is a simple reminder of
All the shots and all the set offs and all the tears I cried so I can get my leg up
And I came back and the joker got his bread up
And walked around town young man with his head up!
Had to make it rain in the storm, didn't let up
Until my movies went out of the theaters
And all you can just forget us
Now Willow is a star man how weak is that?
Pink hair, long socks can't compete with us!

I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I do what I wanna do, where I wanna do it
Hand me the scissors I cut threw it
I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I do what I wanna do, where I wanna do it
You stop me now, I run through it

Uh, pulling off full throttle
All my other haters I'll stuff you down in the bottle
I made that, all you jokers rocking..
Your girl is fine, my girl look like she a modell
Uh, more artistic than Picasso
Unless the joke is up, I'm looking likeâ€¦
My flow is tight, your flow is just not so
Sorry if I'm coming up from being hostile Gonzoes
