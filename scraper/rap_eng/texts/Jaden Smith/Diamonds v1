[Hook: Jaden Smith & ¿Téo?]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
When I open my eyes I can never find them
Skating, sunset and hiding
Got the metal in my mouth, what you think I'm biting
Ladies love it when I sing
Tryna find out what I'm in

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna get you on the floor
You love me girl, I love you more
Last night I just wasn't sure
I'm tryna get you to the court

[Pre-hook: Jaden Smith, ¿Téo?]
I've been there...
I've been there before
Take your legs
And put them around my...

[Hook 2]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
But when I open my eyes I can never find them
Got me running from the sirens
I just woke up on Sunset, and Highland

[Verse 2]
MSFTS are styling (style!, style!)
We know you gotta stylist, joker why you lying
I ain't really with violence
Probably see me at Tyga's house playing violins
Cause money really ain't a thing
All these diamonds and these rings
I should really make a sword
Tryna tell you I'm the guy
Bought a whip, it's in Dubai
Didn't worry from a soul
Rapping like a turtle
I got all these federal reserves notes
Oh, jumping over hurdles
Dont forget a rap a verse
Around you like a circle

[Bridge]
But thats on the day to day
Baby I had a good day today
Send a fuck nigga away, away
Hit a sexy momma with a ¿cómo está?
She come straight from Bogotá
She got the Kamehameha

[Hook]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
When I open my eyes I can never find them
Skating, Sunset and Highland
Got the metal in my mouth, what you think I'm biting

[Outro: ¿Téo?]
Yeah!
