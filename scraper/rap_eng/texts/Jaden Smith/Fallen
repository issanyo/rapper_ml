[Hook]
Yeah
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
Change my taste in music (I'm fallen)
Make me rise with you (She likes you)
I'm surprised you do

[Verse 1]
Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

[Hook]
I'm surprised you do (baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon, and I just needed you

[Verse 2]
Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, O.M.G, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a hundred thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

[Hook]
Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you
You can't see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

[Verse 3]
She said, "Love is a strong word", said love is a strong word?
Well I'mma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stopped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

[Hook]
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
I will see you soon
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
Your homework is due

[Outro]
Syre, do you remember?
What's the difference from the future and the past?
Just seen Batman, Lex Luthor
Drag racing in the Jag-uar
Started floating through the valley
Of the city of the angel scraping cash
Now I'm bleeding on the people
I forget that I still got an open gash
I'm the realest kid you never had, baby
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
