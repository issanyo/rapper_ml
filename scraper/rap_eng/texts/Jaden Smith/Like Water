[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Pythagorean Theorem, yo Cleopatra be the queen of my harem
Huh, Plato and Socrates talk to me luckily no one can hear em
Yeah, you just repeat on the beat like a parrot, I be so embarrassed
Huh, top of Mount Olympus no one is near him but we really need you to move, damn
What the fuck you finna' do man
Triple three, is that the crew? yeah
All my niggas lookin' smooth, ay
See me swimmin' in a suit, ye
Cut that nigga head, yeah he toupee
Now I'm bout to make a movie
With a grown one, cutie
We should roll one loosely
Need some water like Bruce Lee
She my Sugarfish sushi
I should prolly get some new sheets
Need a Tesla with the new seats
Then I'm gone like poofy
Prolly wearin' fake jewelry
All you niggas so boring
Don't call me I'm touring
Ex girl so corny
Call Â¿Teo? we need more fees
Got me strung up off the Morphine
New nigga I'm morphing
More glasses need more *click*
Lose the jokers with the tour tees
You know who your fashion source sees
Bad one, speakin' Portuguese
Wait til she divorces me
Screw your Staples Center floor seats
We just need a billion paying jobs and some more peace
I'm duckin' these people, I'm flippin' up like I'm Evel Knievel
I look at my watch, ain't no time for no freeloaders
My clip was empty, I'm back and I'm reloaded
Yeah, 60 from 0, couple seconds I'm a neighborhood hero
Yeah, I want that dinero, I hop in that taxi like Robert De Niro
Yeah, they wanted the movement, I made it a movement, I made the apparel
Yeah, these children are empty they fallin' in sorrow
Your lyrics are sterile, I told you
"Yo where'd you get that?"
I'm not gonna hold you, got it at Whole Foods
"Ay why you leavin'?", "Where did you go?", "I just gotta know you"
