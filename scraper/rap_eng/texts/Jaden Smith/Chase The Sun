[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl, you can be my Superboo
And you looking stupid cool
In that dress that you wore with the Hightops
I'm clean pressed cause I rolled in the Maybach
But, maybe we should skate sometime
Or go up on a date sometime
Cause whatever you want, we can shop for
Now at the bottom, we can go up to the top floor
New York City, we just chillin' on the top floor
Gold iPhone and I'm hoping that you got yours
Cause baby you're my precious
Led you on a surf, we can go and get some lessons
Take you to Hawaii
Call villain get some sessions in
That's the clique no question
Don't do well with first impressions
I'm the freshest
I open up like all your presents
Girl, this is the life
So just come enjoy this essence
Equals dresses in your bag

[Hook: Josiah Bell]

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky
We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]

As I'm lookin' through a peephole
Girl I'm like a movie and I'm waitin' for my sequel
And it's you
And please don't listen to these other people
Cause all they do is hate
But they say that love is evil (and it's true)
And you not one of them girls that I see up at the school
You the girl at the party wearin' see-through in the pool
And I like you livin' life up on the edge
Feet hangin'
And I'd like to see some life up in this bed
If you aimin' all those shorts that you be wearin'
They be scarin' me
It's feelin' like you 'em and you tear 'em
But apparently these jokers just don't care
And ev'rybody there was starin', G
You just kept on laughin'
Livin' life like it's a parody
But I'm 'bout to kill 'em
Give it to 'em all
Rockin' shorts in the summer, rockin' denim in the fall
And I'mma roll up with my friends in the Benz when you call
Cause we chillin' in the Beamer, but the fans wanna ball

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]

This love is like a fairytale;
It's very well written
Soft lips
Scary thrill if I'll ever be forgiven this
Fresh love...
This fresh love is the best love
The type of love
Where you can't even imagine your next love if there is one
Wisdom is something we lack at this age
It's all fun and games till the kids come, haha
But baby, what's your wish?
Ever since our first kiss, my mom's been dreamin' of fish
We're together now
And I don't care who you been with
This love isn't a myth
So come and chase the sun and in my heart you'll always live
And just know I'll always tell you what it is

[Hook]

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky
We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes...
