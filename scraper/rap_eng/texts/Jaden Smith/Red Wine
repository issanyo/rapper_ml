[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Girl how you feelin'?
Girl how you feelin'?
You know

[Chorus: Téo]
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Yeah, I put my head on a pillow
I sleep
Through peace
And a piece of me leaves
Trick or treat, Halloween
Sip a little bit of that red, red wine
The wine pours
The wine pours, define
Show our [?] stories, we can make it more
Let's make some more
But baby...

[Chorus: Téo]
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit
And I'm so lit

[Verse 2: dylAn]
Always mess up my name, I told 'em "A" is capital
I'm after President Snow, the whole fuckin' capital
Once a young teen, my district 13
Or 12-34, 47 it's a dream
Zoomin' in the Porsche, told Moi to slow down
Got Wells Fargo debt with a Venmo now
The young thug fucked around and got a girlfriend now
Rachel never hit me back so I'm pinned up now
Out in the 'Basas wit my windows down
MSFTS Republic, we the kings of this town
So, you ain't gotta ask who holds that crown
The neanderthals, we keep it raw, we hold that down
Didn't have to check it
On the record, man I'm murkin'
Pause, activating merkaba
Just... just give me one second
Let me pause for a second while I activate my merkaba

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
We don't need to fight
We don't need to write
All of our feelings gon' come on the ceiling
Girl how you feeling?
I'm not a villain, I'm rather super
I'm lookin' dapper, I'm comin' right at yah
I'm comin' right at yah, I'm comin' right at yah
Don't wanna go
