I be sittin' back in my palace
Watchin Alice, eatin salads
With sexy ladies in Balance (Ballads?)
Sippin orange juice out my chalice
Satisfying, my pally
My rhymes tough as a callous, cause
My writtens bout as dark as my tennies
I'm winnin until the finish
They say I'm sick as a clinic
Get your head out my business
I keep it clean as a dentist
And have your fun at the beach
Cause we taking this up to Venice
MSFTS, and we in this
Keep it and then critique it
You leak it, then Imma freak it
You say I'm the ish, I'm reeking
Follow you every weekend
Still seeking for someone decent
Like, we were supposed to be meetin'
But then I found out you vegan
Like, woah! Baby girl
You gotta be movin' fast
You can't be my first
Baby girl but you can be my last
And it kinda hurts
When I see you, Imma need some glasses
And I love you cause you does you
But that love the class (?) girl
I'm on the dash
We sittin here in the fest
Says I kiss you on the neck
Like what are we doing next?
And my dawgs on they decks
Gettin checks
Man we feeling blessed
High up in them jets
That's a yes
And we rep the west
Msfts on our chest
Dressed too good to impress
Yes we do it best
And we never give them nothing less

Cause you do it, what we does
And we do it on the home, and we going off the dome
Cause I'm wreckless, I'll wreck this
I'm on that set list
Don't guess I'm the best cause you should just expect it
At a festival, cause I'm festive
Girls say I'm restless
My clique, you don't mess with
I spit bars, so check this
I'm walkin' in, bingo
My team go, in that gringo
Mingle, cause I'm single
Come catch on to our lingo
Like, "Joka, what's goooooood!"
MSFTS in my hood
Beat my clique, I wish you all could
Cause I got a fine girl named Dominique
Cool take for that nominee
In the club, it's no crime for me
So when the cops come, It's no time to see
I'm so sick
People tell me I'm slick
So I just beat you all in my rhymes
Then Imma give a break to my fists
Man, that's my clique!
