[Pre-Chorus]
Come get a little bit closer
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
She said "Will you be my soldier?"
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
She want to wine and dine, my sofa
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back it up on me like I told you
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight
Tonight, tonight, you're my everything
And I will put that on everything
Your eyes, your hips, your everything
Could probably get me to do anything

[Verse]
She like the rough, wild city (Yikes)
She roll a *****, get busy (Go crazy)
Girl, that was one too many
If I take one shot, I get dizzy (Go, damn)
We need to take some precautions
'Fore we wake up in the garden
Realize we're stupid exhausted
Uber home, I was car sick
Fuck them fuck boys, they gon' talk shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We was in the sky last night, had shit poppin', girl
Going super slow is where you need to take it (Oh)
You know you're gonna wake up faded, girl
All these thoughts 'bout you being naked, girl
This is no relationship, we're just relating, girl

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, you're my everything
And I will put that on everything
Your eyes, your hips, your everything
Could probably get me to do anything

[Bridge]
She want to reach for the bands (Yeah, pick it up)
They do not know how to dance (Yeah, pick it up)
Told my lawyer I'm in France (Yeah, don't pick it up)
I never give her a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Come get a little bit closer
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
She said “Will you be my soldier?”
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
She want to wine and dine, my sofa
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back it up on me like I told you
Oh mami, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight
Tonight, tonight, you're my everything
And I would put that on everything
Your eyes, your hips, your everything
Could probably get me to do anything
