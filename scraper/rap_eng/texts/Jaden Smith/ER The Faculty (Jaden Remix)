[Verse: Jaden Smith]
Money doesn't grow on trees
So why do they keep picking all the leaves?
Never mind, I just found out it's Christmas Eve
Homeless people need to eat
There's a heathen in my sheets
Man she's not planning to leave
Jokers see but don't believe
Man, I'm probably on some things you can't conceive
Assassinate me like a Creed
Hol' up
Got us running from the po' po'
John Lennon and Yoko (Ayy)
Tell me something that I don't know (Ayy)
Take me somewhere where we won't go (Ayy)
Your relationship and status
Got me redder than a radish, baby
We the baddest, baby
You should come get at us, maybe
