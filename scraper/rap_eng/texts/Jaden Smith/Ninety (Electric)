[Intro]
You didn't have to come here

[Chorus]
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money babe
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny
It's something funny, babe
When I open my eyes
Oh, when I open my eyes
I'm never surprised
When I open my eyes
Oh, girl, you’re not here beside me
When I open my eyes
Girl, you’re not by my side
Baby girl, when I open my eyes
Oh I'm never surprised

[Verse]
Girl, I'm traumatized
Singing lullabies in the mountains
When you told us, we were all surprised
Don't worry baby girl I'm on your side
Oh, when I open my eyes
(I wish to see you)
I remember biking through the city
You and *** weren't fucking with me
I was fighting demons, peace officer
They tryna get me, can’t catch you out at a buck fifty
New Balance got me fucking drippy
Young rich ***** never wanna fucking listen
I just thought I'd catch you on a vibe
Oh never mind, girl, never mind
I just thought I'd catch you on a vibe
Horses running through my mind- life
Baby, I was hypnotized
Tie with me
I see you, see you
See you

[Chorus]
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny
It's something funny, bae
When I open my eyes
Oh, girl, you’re not inside
I open my eyes
Oh, when I open my eyes
I'm never surprised

[Outro]
Girl, never mind, we're out of time my only one
So just hold on tight, to those summer nights my love
'Cause this life will pass you by
Girl, never mind, still out of time my only one
So just hold on tight, to those summer nights
'Cause this life will pass you by
Girl, never mind, we're out of time my only one
So just hold on tight, those summer nights...
