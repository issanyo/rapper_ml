[Intro]
Somewhere in the stars now, somewhere
A wise woman told me, where you're going, the Sun never sets
Let go of your stress
A wise woman told me, where you're going is all on the edge
Catch all your breath
Somewhere in the stars now
You were there from the start, how
Could you tear apart my heart now
Your love is all I got now
Oh never mind, girl oh

[Chorus]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
(I was a lost soul, lost soul, lost soul in my room)
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
(I'm in the darkness, shadows got me outta control)
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
(All that I got, all I ever want to do)
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
(All that I ask of you is if you love me too?)

[Verse]
Oh, we're lost now
Voices in your head going off
I heard you and so and so had a falling out, what was that about?
Something happened and she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Girl, a wise woman told me you're the best, baby
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking 'round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble, baby, sit me down
See you soon, whoa

[Breakdown]
I know I'm on a roll when I rock and roll, speeding in my soul
Running through these streets with no control
I'm a renegade, jet planes on the runway
Runaway, runaway, runaway
Now I'm on a roll, when I rock and roll, speeding in my soul
Running through these streets with no control
Just a renegade, on a jet plane on the runway
Runaway, runaway, baby, run away

[Chorus]
I was a lost soul, lost soul, lost soul in my room
(Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room)
I'm in the darkness, shadows got me outta control
(I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room)
All that I got to, all that I ever want to do
(I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room)
All that I ask of you is if you love me too

[Bridge]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

[Outro]
SYRE died in the sunset, don't be like him
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy
I'm just a lost boy
