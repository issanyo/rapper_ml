I went from boy to a man, wow (Man)
Opposition had to stand down
Man, I had to make a perfect plan, now I'm on a wave
(Wave, wave, wave)
I had to fight for the city (For the city)

You gotta do what all leaders do (Go)
Everyone here, we believe in you (Yah)
Know you can be a hero 'cause we seen you do it (Whoo)
And this is the time that we needin' you (You)
Everyone is here to see you move (Move)

[Verse 2]
We had to fight for the town (Town)
Now there's no villains allowed ('Lowed)
Everyone cheer in the crowd, but I'm still way up, I'm over the clouds (Clouds)
We had to fight for the city (City)
Competition was lethal (Lethal)
Honestly it's no biggie (Biggie)
I had to do what all leaders do

Uh, oh, they don't want it, man
Uh, oh, they don't want it, I promise
