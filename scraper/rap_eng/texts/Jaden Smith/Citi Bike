[Verse 1: Jaden Smith + Halsey]
Whatever
I tore my heart out of my chest
And on to a platter
Just so we could be together
She blew me off like a feather
Aight fuck it then
I might fuck her
I might fuck her friend
Who the fuck cares anymore?
Who the fuck compares to this
Voluptuous succubus bitch?
Where the fuck are my keys?
Two three dimes on me
No change, nah mean?
I do lie, yeah I do lie
She probably got a new guy with her tonight
But fuck it
I need a drink and a bucket
And tell your girlfriends talking shit that they can suck it
I fucking loved her
She told me I'm an asshole
Cold ass (ayy!) but the ass though
Tell the jeweler never mind the wedding ring
Fuck her (fuck love), fuck love (fuck this)
Fuck everything

[Hook: Lido + Jaden Smith]
Fuck what you feel like
She got two friends in them skin tight
I'm heart broken but I still might
Three fine hoes on a motherfuckin' Citi bike, yeah

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Towkio]
Look this Hennessy get to talking to me
Tell me I got some bad bitches with better pussy
Ex hoes all friends now they plottin' on me
We should all have an orgy
Yea it's hard to get lonely when that money on me
And that drink on me
Off the Xans, countin' on my bands
It's hard to think 'bout you
Three freak hoes here'll do anything for me
Bitch I'm back in the field, had to get my fit dirty
I don't need you
Got my name tatted too early, haha
Cover that up, you ain't deserve me
I said bitch know you're dead to me
Fuck who you fucking on
Better not be fucking raw
Or I'ma have to cut you off
Bitch I gave you everything
Everything!

[Hook: Lido + Jaden Smith]
Fuck what you feel like
She got two friends in them skin tight
I'm heart broken but I still might
Three fine hoes on a motherfuckin' Citi bike, yeah

[Outro: Halsey]
Everything
