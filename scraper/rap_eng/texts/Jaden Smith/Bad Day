[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you'd just be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Girl I know you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
I wish that you could just be happy
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You're staying [?]
I'll be your man, you stay tonight
But girl you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You say you wish you could be happy
But that ain't cool, sad loves you too

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
And I stare at the moon and I'm barely cool
And I just had a dream that I'd go to Paris with you
And yeah my therapy's through
A picture of me conflicting with freaky sheriffs in school
Embarrassing freaking kids but I cherish you
Apparently I couldn't fall in love with a parachute
I wish I was there for you, really girl I feel terrible
And I wrote a parable for you to burn up and tear, you know
We're living through it, all the pain is unbearable

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you could be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be okay
Girl I know you had a bad day
I can see it in your face
I know you wishing that you were still happy
I can see it in your texts girl
I can read it in your tweets girl
I can feel it in the streets girl
I'm just tryna bridge the peace

[Verse 2: dylAn]
Oh you had a bad day
Cause I had it my way
Should I reply babe
Not my babe but I know you behind me
Going into this blindly
Cause I can't see
Talking philanthropy
Up on the canapy
You cannot stand me
You not understanding me
Understand, I'm your man
If I put my compass inside your hand
Would you [?] it out
Would you drill it out
I don't know what the nails about
But I got the hand when you got the blame
You are not correcting my perfect grammar
Got my brother next to me
He playing the guitars like he's Dan Kanter

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you'd just be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Girl I know you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
I wish that you could just be happy
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
