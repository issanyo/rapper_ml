[Intro]
Yeah!
Oh shit (woo!)
Look, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like a Polaroid picture
Trapped inside space and time, take a sip of my elixir, ay
Play "Electric Love" while we riding in the Fisker, ay
She fell in love with me, my G, I swear I never kissed her, ay
Lead me to be free, I don't have time to be a mister, ay
Baby, I'll be blunt with you, I won't be smoking swishers
I just do a couple dishes then I wish you Merry Christmas
Adios, made that body roll, you scream "Geronimo"
Blow some kisses to some mistresses, they fall like dominos
Dominos, dominos, baby girl, I gotta go
I just talked to Billboard Records, they said I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, that's it, that's all I got right now

[Hook]
Yeah, my name is George Jefferson, the male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with, I ran for president
Cause our country is in a deficit, my only testament
Is that we keep it so surreal, I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo
(I'll kill myself to resurrect)

[Verse 2]
You know she know I'm the man
I got her number on the Gram, I would never understand
Kick it with Rich the Kid, I just woke up with the bands
30 South and we in France
I just woke up, I'm in Cannes, never let 'em have a chance
Huh, cheetah print is on the pants
Expelliarmus, me and Harry Potter in the Benz
Nobody look at my dab, run around skrtin', they mad
Louis just gave me a bag, how did he end up with that?
And nobody look at my dab, now I'm runnin' with the RAF
Living in and out of cabs (skrtt, got 'em)
"Uh, baby boy what's your name?" I thought you'd never ask

[Hook]
Yeah, my name is George Jefferson, the male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with, I ran for president
Cause our country is in a deficit, my only testament
Is that we keep it so surreal, I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo

[Bridge: Jaden Smith & Willow Smith]
Kill myself to resurrect, ay
Kill myself to resurrect, ay
(Jaden, Mom is on the phone for you)
I was, I was just on the phone with her
(Jaden, Dad is on the phone for you)
Let's go

[Outro]
Huh, super-psychedelic sleeping isn't new to me
I tried to sleep it off to deal with everybody's scrutinies
Baby call me Willy Wonka, on my Oompa Loompa steez
Man I'll only whipped the Tesla but I'll cop the coupe and screech (skrt)
