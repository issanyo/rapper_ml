Chorus]
This is how a icon spit it
Python venom tripod sittin
Off white denim dreadlocks swimming
Hands high got the game in a headlock

I’m coming thru you need a fire warning
Wanna smoke you got 5 on it
Take the beat and breathe fire on it
Leave it on repeat to keep the vibe goin
We was broke as fuck ate lies only
I’m a smooth cat with 8 lives on him
Wear a suit and tie when I die only that’s it
Shooting on your block got your wife on it
Dig in her box like there’s a prize for me
Big face hunnids blue lines on it
Bought 2 didn’t ask the price on it

[Verse]
One track away from a mask and a long gat
Beyond that come up short and they can mourn that
Leave words in the air you catching contact
I keep it sub zero for mortal kombat

Bandana tied like a samurai
Got them out the window saying damn he fly
Love Kills is the mission keep the family tied
Neighbors watch your family cry while your hands is tied

Rarebreed tatted on my forearm
Worldstar Hang with porn stars check the score card
Before the bars big fish in a small pond
Now I’m Big Dipping the world bruh
Scars or Minaj baby gave me a choice dog
It’s on till it’s on in my DMx voice tho
If it’s wrong then it’s wrong I’m just making a choice bro
If it’s wrong then it’s wrong I’m just making a choice

Kamikaze flow you a common cold kinda comical
Get the dough close the door like I gotta go
Gotta hottie in her zone feed me beef patties cold
Stop it ho break off some toe
Yo This weed it needs to rolled so
Its 420 now do you smoke
To be honest I just came for the throat
No more condoms I’m a head to the store

I bust it then i hush it
My shorties is clutchin something
What the fuss is your bitch is rushin butta to crush it
No question my brothers will run up on your youngin
All that huffing have you pumping a lung no discussion/

Bust it then I hush it I ain’t got no chill button
What the fuss is your bitch want me kill cousin
No question my brothers will run up on your youngin
All that huffing nothing have you pumping a lung with no discussion boi

[Chorus]
This is how a icon spit it
Python venom tripod sittin
Off white denim  dreadlocks swimming
Hands high got the game in a headlock

I’m coming thru you need a fire warning/
Wanna smoke you need 5 on it/
Take the beat and breathe fire on it/
Leave it on repeat to keep the vibe colder/
We was broke as fuck ate lies only/
I’m a smooth cat with 8 lives on him
Scammers on your block got your wife on it
Wear a suit and tie when I die only
Dig in her box like there’s a prize for me
Big face hunnids blue lines on it
Bought 2 didn’t ask the price for it
This is how a icon spit it
