[Jaden Smith - Verse 1]
Your motion
Got me rollercoastin
I want all in your ocean
Man look it when I goes in
I have no friends
But if you had seen where we came
You would know that we’re just makin a name
Just off Deck and we straight to a plane
Man, I’m insane
This ain’t a game
Half of you jokers don’t hear what I’m sayin
But this is real, I’m feelin pain
All of the things, I don’t say them in vain
Great as a dane, you in my domain
I can be Batman and you could be Bane
Fast as a train, sharp as a brain
I am a poet, I do not explain
These are my feelings, I don’t entertain
Keepin it plain, my take, it look like I’m me
You don’t know what I attain
When I drop flame
I knew I conquered the game
All of these jokers are lame
So tell them to stay in they lane
I spit the fire, you out of the frame
I’m killing em dang man, you thought I would lose?
Who’s this kid with the Louie V shoes?
That would be me and I’m here with my crew
And you not so I think I’mma need a masseuse
Boom, man this what I do
No paper, no pad
Here with my girl and these jokers are mad
You got GPS? Cuz It could’t been bad
I would’ve been lost

[Willow Smith - Hook]
Lost...
In space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bars, Lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

(Verse)
I gave you kisses on yo neck
And chilled after my curfew
I treat you with respect
And girl I never would hurt you
But now, I’m with my G’s
Skatin these streets, baby I’m killin this beat
Fly like the birds and the bees
Please, go get some Z’s
Roll up my sleeves, go to the cosmos
Come back and got a new God flow
Gotta find one in Kabo
Until these jokers know I ain’t macho
No, I’m straight from the basas, I’m skippin my classes
These jokers slow as molasses
My song is massive
Wanna know where all the trash is? Visit them ratchets
Fly as Aladdin, I am so cool you could call me Alaskan
I am the freshest, there’s no point in askin
Live on the edge and you’ll live in your casket
I am the baddest yea
And I’m gon find me a actress
With long hair, nice skin, does backflips
And red lips and she don’t need chapstick
But I’mma be here with my clan
Soon as you land, you got flowers in your hand
Come to the beach, get a tan
Lay in the sand, baby you hot as a pan
Come with the tightest bikini, you eat the Panini cuz baby you can
I’ll be your genie cuz I am your man
Say that I’m dreamin, you hear me like damn
You got me lost

(Bridge)
Lost in space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bar, lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

Lost
Lost
