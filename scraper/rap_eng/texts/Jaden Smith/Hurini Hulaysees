[Verse:]
I don't usually get turnt but I'm feeling like a door knob
When that bus rollin' Lil' joker I'm a tour guide
Chillin in Dubai, and I'm feeling like I'm poor boy
Whether you know or not, Lil' joker can't afford that, woah

Bout to drop an album, that's a short shot
See that body roll, Lil' Mami I want more of that
Hit me on the phone with your problems, I been knowing that
You spraying chem trails in the sky that I be soaring at
I told you's

I'm hot as water when it boils
I rub yo body with the oils (yeah)
I wrap the crystals with the coils, man we got the pure silver
I ain't messing with the foils, I don't know you's
And that's the issue, tell security to look at your credentials
Before you blow up like a missile. Let's keep it simple
Saying, "Jaden, man, I want to know the info"
But you don't know what you're in fo', I'm being mintal
All white, you can call it clean dental and I got a nice girl with a movie and a dimple, and my doctor tried to tell that it's mental
I love you's
