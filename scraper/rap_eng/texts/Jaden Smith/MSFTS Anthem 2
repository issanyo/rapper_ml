[Verse 1]
Listen, my clique is vicious
Don't get it twisted, we wicked
We dripping in something vintage
Maybach is what we whipped in
Huh
Like what's going on in them windows?
Really only my friends know
Cause it's 'bout as dark as that tint goes
It go blah!
Man, I don't break tradish'
Got Cartier on my fingertips
And a fine one on my lips
Need a nice pool to take dips
Studio to make hits
Private plane to take trips
Ima' need a custom dress for your hips

Why you looking so formal?
White house, drop crotch, that's normal
I'm in France, bonjour yo
Man, you don't know

And I'm so done
New year, that's king time

Bling bling time
Don't got time to you, bring time
Just whhat up, ching ching time

[Verse 2:]
Man, I'm walking in like bingo
My team go and that green go
I mingle cause I'm single
Come catch onto our lingo
Like boom
Go lay down on that sofa
Talk mess, don't move like sculptures

Won't wait till I grow up

So sick that you throw up
