To be honest, my conscience giving me caution
I'm dealing with all this nonsense
To be honest, I'm talking to all my aunts
And they giving me bad responses
Girl, I'm a be honest
They got trickery in their pockets
They're hearts are blacker than onyx
And girl, let's just be honest
I feel like I'm on narcotics with you
I feel so erotic
You know I'm a workaholic
If your fingernails are still polished
You're planning to go to college
Then we shouldn't have to worry
That you live your life in a hurry
You drivin out so it's blurry
We fallin down in a flurry
You serious... you go through these periods
When you hang with these eerie kids
It's hilarious
And you call me while you're delirious and tell me
How it's going and then I start to get furious
You go up in your room, play Sia, light a candle
I play Bella's Lullaby while I cry on the piano
People questioned that I love her
Just know it cuts deeper than what all
Them bracelets cover and that's very true
And this ain't another cover
This is to uncover all the magic
That is happening this summer
And girl, you'll always be my lover
But then a time will come where you'll
Go and find another
But you'll always be my star
(Girl, you'll always be my star)

Man, I remember
(No matter where you are)
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)
Back in...I don't even remember...how old I was
(You'll always be my star)
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)

But.. I might have been like 8 when I had my first girlfriend
I guess we've been messing up ever since
I don't do it on purpose so...
I guess... I don't know if it's me.. or, what

I want somebody
That can touch my body
Who's loving everybody
But is loving nobody but me
And nobody can see
What me and her are doing on our spare time
Cause that's our time
It isn't their time

And I'm just sad because it's over
And I'm not the one to look over my shoulder
Keep on moving forward
If I'm looking back I'm gonna try
And she told me that I'm really just a selfish kind of guy
Well I guess she knows me best
But it didn't feel like it when her hands was on my chest
I guess that Costa Rica and Philly was very selfish of me
Well I'm sorry girl, I'm just silly and I feel hopeless if that's true
Because you know that I'm feeling so very lonely when you're gone and we were chilling until we... broke up

Know what?
You was there when I woke up
Got emotions that we can soak up
Girl, I can be your soldier
Girl I promise that
And I'll never take that promise back
If it wasnâ€™t for you I would just kinda rap
Prince Charming may come one day
And girl I'm fine with that'
But you'll always be my star
(You'll always be my star)
(You'll always be my star)
Girl, no matter where you are
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)
Girl you'll always be my star
You know that
You'll always be my...
Girl you'll always be my star

Cause this room is really starry
This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Yea it's really starry
This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Sof, girl I'm sorry
Cause This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Kennedy, I'm sorry
This is me telling all them other girls that I'm just sorry cause
Man, this room is really starry
And I'm sorry
Girl, you know I'm sorry
This room is really starry
Rachel, girl I'm sorry
Man, this room is just so starry
And it's time I should say sorry
But it's bright outside
Girl, in here it's really starry
Olivia I'm sorry but this room is so... starry
Girl, I'm sorry
But this room is really starry

Stella...
Girl, I'm sorry
