[Chorus: Ian Frequency]:
They say Ian why you doin' shit
I'm too legit to quit
And I neva' miss
Watch me hit a swish
They hate cause you grew up pissed
Why you doin' this
Man they ain't doin' shit
Man why you doin' this

[Verse 1: Ian Frequency]
Uh, lights camera action
Man I'm in it for the passion
Heart just keeps on beating faster
Yeah, uh, call me Astro
Now I'm the cool kid in the fast lane
I ain't livin' by my last name
In my head doin' fractions
Do it while I'm runnin' backwards
I just had an epiphany
Vibrations within me in symphony
That liderin shit got me feeling sick
I burn like inferno my arsenal
I'm jumpin' like verticals I'm hurdlin'
Workin for minimum, gotta quit
These jokers just testin' my diligence
Magnificent when we deliver it
Yeah we rollin' like a rollercoaster
Hop up on the wave, yeah we surfin'
Man I'm always certain
Hide behind the curtains cause I'm always nervous (Im runnin' just try and catch up to me)
60 low east side
Hop out the whip feel the vibe
19 so alive, shouts out Clementine

[Bridge: Ian Frequency]
Yeah I got no ceilin'
I'm doin' what I can you can hear the feelin'
Can you feel it?
I'm a cardinal flyin' high
You can feel the vibe

[Verse 2: Ian Frequency]
Word to mom, tell her I'll be okay
Like Derrick Rose got the passion to play
Doubt me and imma' duck in ya face
All these people hatin' imma fade away
Tryna' bite the sound but this shit is not venomous
Parents think I need a therapist
When I was little I was arrogant
But now I climbing down the stairs again
Really life is like a movie
Energy flowin' right through me
I've got the light imma' use it
Yeah I'm feelin' like a Buddhist
Tired of these people tellin' me what I can't do
Heart of a lion, I can't lose
You know Ian he's an animal
Under moonlight a werewolf


[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Yeah, childhood memories fade away

They say Jaden why you do that shit
Too legit to quit
And I neva' miss
Watch me hit a swish
They hate cause you grew up rich
And you doin' shit
They ain't doin' shit
What you do

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
They say Jaden why you doin' shit
Too legit to quit
And I neva' miss
Watch me hit a swish
They hate cause you grew up rich
And you doin' shit
Just Water that blew up quick
They wish that they knew us then
Get Down with a fro and a band
A year later and the show never ends
It's me, Moi, her and all of her friends
My heart is broken but I'm caught up again
Does Whitney still chill with Oliver, damn
My wrist is like a frozen aquifer, black
Shade Room causin' *** man, that's why I'm duckin' your photographers man
490 on me like them officers damn
Them politicians takin' shots at the fam, I never thought that it would end up this way
Childhood memories fade away
Put my grills and will in the safe just so I can know my niggas okay
I'm feelin' lit I'll take a piss in a lake
Eve please don't get bit by my snake
I try to do it better everyday
It's hard when your neighbors Kanye and Drake
My stomach full, I got a lot on my plate
My exes look at me and laugh at my face
But they'll never take my passion away
Apocryphal said he's born in a cave
Im never cryin' if I'm pourin' Ros√©
A workaholic homie what should I say


[Outro: Ian Frequency & Jaden Smith]
They say Jaden why you doin' shit
I'm too legit to quit
And I neva miss
Watch me hit a swish
They hate cause you grew up rich

They say Ian why you doin' shit
I'm too legit to quit
And I neva' miss
Watch me hit a swish
They hate cause you grew up pissed

Yeah I feel you, it'd be somethin' like
Oh how I love you, girl
