[Verse]
Uh, man I need to finish, I should finish
Man, I need to finish my album
Go on tour, find Sarah
Then I sip vodka kinda like a fountain
Young Calabasas kingpin
Life is just a journey up a mountain
Get a up and down, scouting
Bouncer saying, "Why you bouncing?"
Just wear my hair up
Blow my cover when I walk in and DJ announce it
You always with the model chicks
They ain't thick, they just weigh a few ounces
I'm a black panther, watch me pounce quick
Get the fire hose, finna Dhalsim
I don't mess with the rap game
Me and Raury chillin in the Falcon
Ain't gone fill me up, with your doubt pen talk
With your girl saying, "How can this lil' joker fit a thousand words in a sentence like a Malcolm X Y, Z"â€”don't try me
MSFTS around the globe regard me highly
And I'm running from the cops, Cyrus
Man these jokers probably think I'm Miley
Confused teen and I might be
In-between an innovator and a Hypebeast
And I know you don't like me
And its just cause you just like me
I just chose not to wear the wife beater
With the Nikes and the white tees
And now everybody wearing tight jeans
Once upon a time you thought you'd fight me
Well I guess now, we should square up
Like my sap niggas up in Paris
Take a pair of parables and tear em up
'Fore your damn poetry embarrass us
I'm under ground like I'm Harriet Tubman
Clique is training, we preparing to run shit
Feeling lit, I'll take my parents to London
Trust you don't want this
The clique is ready for the functions
You ain't ready for this subject
I treat my body like it's Jean Michel
Pay a pretty penny if you touch it
Call me Keanu, I'm Neo
I should hit that with the free throw, swish
Fake ice on my wrist man, I'm frio
I should hit them with the Rio
Your banana flows they don't appeal
I told you I'm the man of steel
I believe in Santa still
Cause I got more ice than the snow
I cannot buy no more clothes
I got to the store, it was closed
Imma play this at the shows
I woke up my wrist it was froze
Since when is Jaden golden?
I was learning, you ain't notice?
Now I came back and I'm on my grown shit
Look here baby, you should focus
The ignorance is numbing you
And now I'm spitting this and novacaine is over
Running round the city like a casanova
Peter Piper picked a golden pencil from a shoulder
Turned a lyricist into a soldier
How many times have I told ya?
And how many times am I telling them
Just because you see the melanin
Doesn't mean that I'm a felon
I'm here to show you the intelligence
What is the bullshit you're selling them?
They just want us all in jail and then
They can take away our right to vote and use the free labor
Aye, I know you're not a slave bruh
And I didn't even need to say much
Man you knew since you was born there
You were sent down here to save us
But life just keeps throwing shit at you
And you was looking for a break huh?
Well, here it is...
