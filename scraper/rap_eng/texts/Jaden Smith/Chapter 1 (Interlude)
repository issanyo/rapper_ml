[Spoken Word: Jaden Smith]
And that's just the way it goes
As we journey through the land of the legend of the yellow rose
Of course, we find
Unprecedented capability to make this young love grow
We might just find ourselves washed on the shores of a new beginning
A new love, new eventual heart break
Some things heal, some things bleed forever
This is yesterday's tomorrow night
