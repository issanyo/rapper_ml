Swag, Swag, Swag, Swag

Uh, roll up, cash get grown
MCM backpack pass says rat pack on it
And I'm bout to go ham
I don't even got a swag hat, uhh

Ohh JB, where my calls at
Oh, you all lil jokes better fall back
Couple millions on the movies what you call that
I don't give a ****
Someone tell me where the stalls at
Swaggy

Young Smitho
Say I got swag, probably won't say dildo
Cuz I am the only one
They call me the holy one
I ain't tryin force you but you callin me the only one

So get up on this
I'm lookin for a hot one
Talkin bout a boyfriend, hope that you ain't got one
Cuz even if you do, we can make it work though
Girl I'm not a jerk, I just want to see you twerk
Ohh, jeez

So back it up till you fill my hands touchin you
Girl I'm tryina kick it, no I'm not in love with you
Here for one night, so lets get in some more trouble
So I'll go handle the bill
So you can be Mrs Huxtable

Ooh, your body lookin like a soda bottle
Said you want to go to Germany, lets go tommorow
Cuz you certainly lookin like the hottest model
When you in that dress, oh yes you know that the motto

Ooh and you just scared of something long term
Mess it up as soon as I say the wrong words
What doesn't kill me is probably gonna make me stronger
I'm a workaholic, girl that's why you call me anders

Bring the guitar in and they bringin us all in
Were waitin at valet, there bringin my car in
And were makin a Maybach movie
And its starring me and my clique
Were kicking it like a sidekick

So get up on this
I'm lookin for a hot one
Talkin bout a boyfriend, hope that you ain't got one
Cuz even if you do, we can make it work though
Girl I'm not a jerk, I just want to see you twerk
Ohh, jeez

So back it up till you fill my hands touchin you
Girl I'm tryina kick it but now I think I'm in love with you
Here for one night, so lets get in some more trouble
And I'll go handle the bill
So you can be Mrs Huxtable, ohh

Please don't cry to me baby
Please don't lie to me baby
Come over here, close your eyes with me baby
Yeah this world is so harsh
Come survive with me baby, ohh

Bad times, yeah we had those
Back when I was rocking bad flows
Back when I wasn't doing battles
Back when a joka was rocking afros

So get up on this
I'm lookin for a hot one
Talkin bout a boyfriend, hope that you ain't got one
Cuz even if you do, we can make it work though
Girl I'm not a jerk, I just want to see you twerk
Ohh, jeez

So back it up till you fill my hands touchin you
Girl I'm tryina kick it but now I think I'm in love with you
Here for one night, so lets get in some more trouble
