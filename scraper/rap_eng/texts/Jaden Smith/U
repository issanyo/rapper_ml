[Intro: Lido & TÃ©o]
I was tryin' to love you but we
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Said shawty I was fucking tryna love you but we, ohh
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you but we, hey
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you but we, falling
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you but we, ohh
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Said shawty I was fucking tryna love you but we, ohh
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you, falling
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Did everything, I did everything
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Heart is broken, heart is broken
Gettin' green, gettin' green
Man I'm artichokin', man I'm artichokin'
I can't breathe, that's the art of chokin'
That's the, that's the art of chokin' (woo!)
Send a text, I never opened it
You thought I read this shit? Well I was jokin'
Falling down like I'm in Autumn
All you jokers spitting nada, nada, nada
Six minutes and I still gotta mind my muh'fuckin' problem
Calm down, calm down

[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
Hm, hm, hm, hm, now we're still here
Thank you

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Try me, come try me
I wish you could see what I see
I'm late, you find me so timely
I'm lost, baby, come and find me
Girl, I'm fallin' to the ground and you'll never get me up
I'm just a baby with a stack of needles and a sippy cup
And this shit sucks, need some love, my Aphrodite I can touch
Elvis Presley's coming out of me, my head has got a rush
Didn't pick a fight, the FBI just picked a fight with me
Man I cry at night, like every night, just come right here and see
Screw your V.I.P, we are like Adam and Eve, we are like Adam and Eve
We are like Adam and Eve, oh no, what happened to me? No
Jimi Hendrix with the flex
On the Ford motor, rollin', gettin' checks
At your crib for the chill
Who is at the door? Are you finna check, check, check?
Man, you better show respect
Man, I let her go, we both know I had her
Man, I'm madder than a hatter
Played my heart and now I'm swagger than Mick Jagger

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, I told 'em
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the check, check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check (you were my love)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you were mine)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you watch me breathe)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

You were my love, You were my love
Don't let you in my life
Don't be rude to us
Sorry don't be rude to us

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
You're no good for me girl, you're cruel and infectious
You are my wish, this is me with a death wish
I'm smart, I should get this but, your eyes, your hips, your lips
To me they're so precious, I guard them like treasures
I'd run, I'd drive, I'd fly distant measures just to witness your gestures
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
(I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I'm crying to sleep, girl, I'm crying to sleep)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(I'll die by the sea, girl, I'll die by the sea)
Will you die with me, girl? Will you die with me?
The future I see, girl, will you try to see?
