[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down

[Bridge 1]
And don't take it personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook]
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you
Tell me whatcha say now

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Listen close to what I say to you
Back in the day I hated you
Don't worry we made it through
That was back in the days
No one cared about Jaden dude
He hangs with his MSFTS and the kids that think Satanâ€™s cool
But lately you been bringing out in me a young poet
Your monogamy, it bothers me you know it
There's no need to show it
On my poetry you saw me throw it
Your man just came through in a Range
Hope they tow it girl just for the moment
Cause your body's a temple, it's simple no need for an intro
See what's sinful and they want it, they keep it resentful
Girl don't listen to these pimps, they got no one to vent to
Said you want some In-N-Out we should probably hit Ventu
And I went through probably all of the texts that i sent you
And I meant to tell you that I stencil my love with a pencil
I can't express it through all my stressing and adolescents
Same with Willow
I need a doctor to come assess us
I'm sick of guessin'
I'm sick of dresses, I'm sick of dressin'
Let's get undressed and let's make a mess
'Til we feel the presence, like girl I can feel the presence
Girl it's like you're my therapist and I love our sessions
And baby girl it's unbearable when we in the kitchen
Cause we gotta be quiet cause your parents listen
Like screw this I'm sick of kissing
Like baby I'm on a mission
Everytime we away we casually reminiscing
Our practice is repetition..

[Hook]
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like em
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
And do different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Bridge 2]
In the way (like a bitch)
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

[Outro]
I don't need you (x4)
I still want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I, but I love you
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you
