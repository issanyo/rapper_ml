[Verse 1]
Done with reminiscin'
Spittin' fire hotter than the pot up in the kitchen, yuh
And lately I've been itchin' to take a rapper on
'Cause I'm really done with all the sneak disses, yuh
My whip is fully electric
You need a lesson just to whip it, ay, ay
I'm on the other side havin' way too good a time
Baby, why you still trippin', yuh?
Probably 'cause I'm sippin' penicillin
'Cause I'm so sick, Joker, I'm just chillin' like a villain, yuh
Couldn't think of any better feelin', no
I hope you trip when I whip out the flow, yuh
She got the ice, I can tell, watch when I slip on the snow, oh
Gas, goin' fast to my destination, I ain't worried 'bout traffic (No)

[Bridge]
Look, are we in Colorado (Wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay, wishin' for all and all
Get the motorcycle, hit the throttle, watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto

[Hook]
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

[Verse 2]
Skinny Young Jiggy in your city, yuh (Yo)
Huh, I say I wanna battle and you say you too dizzy, no
You just don't want to mess with the finessin'
I get it, they said you stressin', keep you living
I hope you know that I been spitting since I turned seven
If you're a ship, I'm 'bout to wreck it, I told you
Look, skinny Young Jiggy in your city, yuh
I don't talk to you, I'ma talk to my bruhs, uh
Go to Philly, say hello to my cousin, uh
You talking all that mess, I know you don't want it, yuh
Hey, skinny Young Jiggy in the city, yuh
Hey, ay, be my baby girl, you hella pretty, yuh, yuh, yuh
Motocross down the street to this beat
I'm popping a wheelie (Skrt!)
Hey, keep my family closer than these jokers
Don't make me go to Philly
I told you, I'm bodying all you
I'm not gonna hold you, shout-out to Whole Foods
Them jokers are old news
You know it's lit when they don't notice you
I'm 'bout to matte the Tesla
And I shed a bullet for my MSFTS soldiers who I owe it to
The FDA is all on me, you know it's true
The clique is rolling and I'm on the move

[Hook]
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

[Bridge]
Look, are we in Colorado (Wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay, wishin' for all and all
Get the motorcycle, hit the throttle, watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto
Yeah, look

[Outro]
(Syre, don't do this)
I don't wanna cry, I just want to get you out of my mind
(Don't open up to him)
Open your eyes, I been by your side through all of this time
(Don't tell him anything)
Excuse the disguise for all the magic that is hitting my mind
We're living a lie
Open your eyes, I been by your side through all of this time
Through all of them guys, through all of them lies
(I love you more) Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die
Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die
