[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out of my conscious, out of my conscious in my room

[Bridge]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room

[Verse 1]
It's all lost
Cigarette smoke spark in the dark, ash
Baby girl I worry about you, you never talk
And, I guess that's the way I am
I guess that's the way I am

[Bridge]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle

[Verse 2]
Oh boy you're lost now
Voices in your head gone now
I heard you and so-and-so had a falling out
What was that about?
Something happened then she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Boy you not a hero, you a problem child
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble baby, sit me down
So lost (so lost)
Sit alone in my room waiting for the dark (for the dark)
Cigarette smoke lights, see the sparks (see the sparks)
I seek your soul
I'm trapped in my room (trapped in my room)

[Bridge]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

[Verse 3]
I'm all alone
Why can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)
I'm here girl, just come on home
My secrets, you will never know (You will never know)
Why are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)
Why can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)
Did I skip you cause I'm telling untold?
And I'll go

[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy
I don't look outside, no I don't at all
Loving is after us, I hear there's a love for us
I know there's a love for us, I know you're on to shit
I know you're by yourself
I know there's a love for us, for all our accomplishments
This is beyond our sin, I do not want this shit
I was a lost boy, I do not got a choice
I couldn't live alone, all I got is my voice
We couldn't conversate, you didn't wanna talk
I don't wanna fight with you, just wanna spend the night with you

[Verse 4]
Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him
Man that's where the story ends, but it also begins
He's building pyramids, he's getting serious
Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this
This ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists
Even though I may appear as this, see Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night
There’s a python in the pyramids
Look, this is for the kids feeling lost
Sleep on the street, eating the moss
I don’t got no more teeth in my jaws
Cause I ripped them out, I’m sick of killing innocents at large
This is for the kids feeling lost
MSFTS got you at all costs
Yelling "fuck 'em all", we hold each other, we never fall
It’s us versus the all, from my cats to my dogs forever
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
