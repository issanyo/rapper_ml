[Intro]
Dilla came back to this planet through Daniel (x3)
Laid this beat down, then went back to the astral
Then played this on piano add a little more keys
As the frequencies grow, instruments get more compatible

[Verse]
Catapult
Inside the ground little caterpillars, has to grow
Turn to in a butterfly, flying like a radical
Playing in the sky, higher than a damn magical
One dragon he was laughing at me
But then I had to go
(Yo, Ah)
You a pretty thing
Maybe wait a couple years, you want a pretty ring
Isn’t that right?
Can I make you more conscious?
Can I get up in your conscience?
You tell your friends I’m obnoxious
Aw, look all those pretty boys talk slick
Girls say those pretty boys talk slick
[1, 2, 3, and 4]
I got you there baby girl this love is toxic
I’m on the top floor and not a single plan is stopping
Nah baby girl we get it popping (us)
Time to land we in the cockpit
Ay we in the LA, we in Chicago
Ay we in the town, we in Miami now
Ay me and Danny probably headed for the Grammy now
We stunting boy you with some hand-me downs
Ya
And my freak loads girls give me the besitos
Make it to London, Heathrow
Missing all of my free throws
She did cheat codes[?]
Making movies with zero sequels
Hanging out with the weirdest people
Me and you look like we belong, bæ were amigos
A seguir me poquito[?]
You couldn’t faze me see the future and day dream
Several doses of raging[?]
See me on the screen, they scream you can’t replace me
Eating lobster is tasty, man you can’t even taste me
Jokers think that they are fresh, your verses are toothpastey
I’m too hasty
Edger Casey
Still under 18
Hella spacey
Obviously you be seeing different stuff than they see
Your teacher hates me
Man your parents want to make me
Damn what goodness sakes B we’re the A-team
Hate the way we say things
But we make dreams, come true
And escape clean and they’re hating
(Yeah, ah)
But so would I, if I was them
Because when you leader of tower, every coward is you friend
(Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Do things
Computers can't say things
