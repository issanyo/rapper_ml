[Verse]
I don't wanna cry
I just want to get you out of my mind
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
Excuse the disguise
For all the magic that is hitting my mind
We're living a lie
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
Through all of them guys
Through all of them lies

[Outro]
Ooh, help us
Something is new
Tell us
Talking to you
Selfish
I do not want to die
