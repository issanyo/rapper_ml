Get down brothers, we came to rock
And you know we had to fight to reach the top
Five young kids who came to rock
And you know we had to take it to the top
Blood, sweat, tears we had to spill
Pure, real MCs with two wheels of steel
This is our time to start the clock
You know we had to fight to reach the top

Want the get down, get down brothers
Want the get down, get down brothers?

[Jaden Smith]

We had to break the locks
We fought our way up to the top

[Skylan Brooks]

[Justice Smith]

[Jaden Smith]
I'm Dizzee, the man, the high exalted
With my spray paint I bomb my iron horses
They told me I was young and lawless
Now everybody gonna see how fly my art is
I'm like Van Gogh, I rock the Kangol
With the S.O.U.T.H, Bronx flow
Get down brothers man, you know we fresh
Ra-Ra grab the mic, 'cause I'm outta breath

[Skylan Brooks]
You rock the Kangol, I rock the Jordache
Show me wheres the money, Imma get that fast
I'm in a limousine, you got a bus pass
You keep the WIC check, I'm 'bout the cold cash
Like a lawyer or doctor
'Cuz I'm always a watcher
On the stage I'm a shocker
And on the mic i'm a rocker
See,i'm not an imposter
They call me Ra-Ra,i'm hotter than a sun ray
Mc Boo andale

[Tremaine Brown Jr.]
Streetwise,some say I'm before my time
War chief of my clan new york is mine
I might not be the tallest guy
But when females look inside my eyes
They stop, they stare, they hypnotized
Caught the Boo-Boo flu they fevers high
Like the Jackson Five, I'm like Michael in the front
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba!

[Justice Smith]
Yeah, I can hear God answering me
It's been so hard looking at my family tree
It could've been so beautiful fucking the talknologist
Knew we didn't need no colleges
Who are against half-black and puerto ricans
I started thinking I need to be
Where the party people be freaking
My brother Shaolin
Know we bonded for life
Five of us brothers
Till they turn out the lights

[All]
'Til they turn out the lights, yeah
'Til they turn out the lights

[Justice Smith]
'Cause we did it from the Bronx and the projects
We are like real life survivors
Everybody out there say yeah
Everybody put your hands in the air

[All]
Get down brothers forever we swear
'Cause we are as, as one
We had to break the locks
We fought our way up to the top
We had to break the locks
We fought our way up to the top
We had to break the locks
We fought our way up to the top
You can't, can't, can't stop us
You can't, can't, can't stop us
You can't, can't, can't stop us
