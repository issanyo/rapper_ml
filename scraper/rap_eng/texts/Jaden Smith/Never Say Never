[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Never say never
Yeah, never ever ever ever ever
(pick it up pick it up...)
Yeah, yeah never ever ever ever ever

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say it, never never say it

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause there's just no turning back (oh no)
When your heart's under attack (oh no)
Gonna give everything I have
Cause this is my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & Justin Bieber]
Here we go, Guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Say never
I will never say never (never say it, never never say it)
Say never
I will fight to forever to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
Never say never, never say never, never say it
Never say never and never say never, never say it
Never say never, never say never, never say it
And never say never
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never
And never say never
