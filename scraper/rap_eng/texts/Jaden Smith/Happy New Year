[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl it's almost a new year, and it's too clear, me you and a root bear float
In my house 'bout to count down cause we got a whole crew here
Yo they 'bout to party hardy, looking for a hottie with a nice body
Ooh y'all have fun with that and we don't need the mistletoe we was under that like 20 minutes ago
And if you can give me all your love you better give me some more
Cause the new years coming, you ain't tripping no more, so I don't need music, rather listen to your heartbeat
Try to stop me if you want to but you know you don't want to
So don't do it, don't ruin the moment I put me and you in

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's the start of the new year, baby, baby yeah
And I know what to do with it, baby baby yeah
I'mma make your cheeks red when I kiss your neck
Girl I'm never leaving cause you are the best baby
Yeah yeah, I wanna give you everything
Never fear cause girl you're coming home with me, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
5,4,3,2,1, kiss me, kiss me
5,4,3,2,1, kiss me, kiss me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's the new year me and you girl yeah I know this love is true
I remember when you moved here everything was oh so new here
Yeah I promise to be true dear, and I'll give all my love to you dear
Jaden Smith is to my right that's the crew there and he's got a root beer, swag

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Got friends I called 'em all cause 2012 is the year of the love
And we gon' start it off, we can get a plane today and get a car tomorrow
We don't do it small at all, no girl tell me what I gotta to do
I can be the beat that you rocking to, I can do anything nothing is impossible especially with you girl
And I never need a new girl, this love is true girl
Aye welcome to the crew girl, 2012 I'm so excited, mayans was lying nobody's dying
Yeah girl but you knew that, knocking at your door like "Who's That?"
Yes I love you, you say true that, guys they want you I say too bad

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's the year, I wanna give you everything
Never fear cause girl you're coming home with me, yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
If you got a girl put your hands up
Ladies if you got a man put your hands up
If you got a girl put your hands up
Ladies if you got a man put your hands up
2012 is the year to be, better, stronger
And closer to the people around you
So grab someone special
And just, you know

[Chorus x2]
