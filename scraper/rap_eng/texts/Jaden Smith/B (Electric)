[Intro]
We could have been never endless
Just let the past be the past

[Chorus]
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

[Verse 1]
So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that they would choose
If happy, I would die here in your arms (in your arms)
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
Girl, I don't know why
I float alone in the sky at night (all alone in the sky at night)
So, baby, hold me tight
We need to be in each other's lives

[Chorus]
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, I don't know why
Float alone in the sky at night
So, baby, hold me tight
Need to be in each other's lives
She said "I don't love you"
Not good enough, wasn't good enough
She said "I don't love you"
Not good enough, wasn't good enough
She said "I don't love you, stay out"
(I was tryna love you but we falling down)
I love you now
Good enough, good enough
(Leave me alone)
I need to feel your bones
I need you in my home now
Girl I’m in my room
(Wake up)
She said “I don’t love you, no”
I’m falling down, good enough
She said “I don’t love you”
Falling down
She said “I don’t love you”
I love you
