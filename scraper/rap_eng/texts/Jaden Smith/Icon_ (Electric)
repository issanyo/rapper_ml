[Part 1]

[Intro]
You're on my mind (hahaha)
You're on my mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, huh-huh-huh-huh
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, huh-huh-huh
Groove, rock, groove
It's real smoky in this room right now

[Verse 1]
What you call an icon living?
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it, woah
Nylon strings on a Fender, woah
We make it hot in December
'Bout to make a movie independent
Need new trucks, Independent
I need you to listen to the vision
All your verses sound like dirty dishes, that's gross
I'm about to clean 'em in the kitchen (What?)
And we making money by the minute, finna blow
I'm about to do it way different, that's godly
I am just a—
You are just an icon living, living
Icon, icon, living (woah)
You are just an icon living, living
You are just an icon, icon living
I am not a Mayan, I'm a menace (I'm a menace)
It's wild, you can lie like a professor
I don't got the time to spit a whole lecture (stretcher)
I am here and I'm still flexing
You are just a—living
Start a new wave, MSFTS just did it
Be specific, pourin' champagne in the distance
Sunset and they still reminiscin'

[Verse 2]
Last verse was before the award show
Me and Moi dipping in the Porsche, so what?
I ain't even take it on tour, so what?
D—damn, last girl signed the divorce, so what?
Now I'm focused and we 'bout to all blow-up
We just tryna make the whole crowd go nuts
Look, we don't know no one like you
Gold grills and you dance like Michael (like Michael)
No I's, MSFTS; no typos (woah)
Look, wait, we ju' wanna make you go psycho
Put a hundred thousand dollars in a Bible
I took the game with my eyes closed
Last verse was before the award show (what?)
Icon tatted on my torso (what?)
Me and Moi dipping in a Porsche, so what?
I ain't even take it on tour, so what?
Your shit is fire, I'm more so
Young Jaden dyin' on the floor, so
She broke my heart to the core
I guess we all gotta, grow up
I am just an icon living
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it
Interview cover five minutes (five minutes)
We are too hot in the business
I'm going straight to the top with the crew
We should just chill and maybe take it slow
'Fore we get up there with nowhere to go
And we can chill and just look at the view
Load a yellow rose into a rifle (rifle)
Me and Harry 'bout to go psycho (go psycho)
Put a hundred thousand in a bible
I got gold teeth, dance like Michael
Man, this nigga on like a lightbulb
Owe it all to Cudi and to Tycho, woah
'Bout to make a movie independent
Need new trucks, independent
I need you to listen to the vision
All your verses sound like dirty dishes, that's gross
I'm about to clean them in the kitchen
And we making money by the minute
I'm about to do it way different
You are just an icon living, better know it

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
This a story for the youth
I am not an icon, you are
I can see the youth marching in the street getting stronger
Every movement like a python
You don't know what I saw
I am not an icon
Happens when we run out of oil and the soil goes dry and we can't turn the lights on?
Huh?
Then who gon' be our icon?
Not me, it gotta be you
'Cause if we don't work together for the better then we all just through
I just saw lil' Jonny tying a noose, we could bring our gangs together and buy us a truce
It don't matter who is who, if you know them from that crew 'cause we all lose
If we don't choose or do someway new, and the fact is: it all comes back to you
I am not an icon living, man, I'm just a young kid tryna speak to the children, damn
Illuminati capital for villains, when I walk around town, man, I see all they victims, damn
Send my love to Nujabes and Dilla
I'ma keep speakin' truth 'til these jokers try to kill us, it's the plan
I'm the realest if you feel us get up on your feet make a difference you can talk but they don't wanna listen
God damn
I am not an icon living, man
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it, so you can
Twenty-five lives, every five minutes
And higher-ups know but they never will admit it
God damn
I know too much I seen it in my visions, homie
Nibiru is coming you just wait on the collision
Till then I'ma handle business, I'm a Calabasas menace but I need you all to step up 'cause one day we gon' be finished, god damn
I am not an icon, you are
This a story for the youth

[Outro]
(A far as MSFTS, This is bigger than us, this is bigger than me and you)
(This about the next generation, this is about the worldwide vision, this about the world coming together, this about the future of humanity)
(And as far as him, I can't speak on him... That's not me, this is the real me)
(Always remember the real me, this is the real me)
(I can't control him, he's coming, he's coming)
(ERYS is coming, ERYS is coming)
