[Intro]
Let your heart just rest on mine, girl
I'm all alone, all my life
Let your heart just rest on mine, girl
I'm all alone, all my life
Let your heart just rest on mine, girl
Look at yours, it's alright
I just wanna hold you tight, girl
I'm all alone, all my life
Let your heart just rest on mine, girl
I'm all alone, all my life
Let your heart just rest on mine

[Verse 1]
Remember the time when our hips were tight
You were my reminder, I need to find you
Girl, we came so close
I still got your clothes sitting in my room, while I play this music
You're not my girl no more, let the rain just pour
On me while I lay here and listen to music

[Chorus]
Starin' at the city lights on the bright side
You'll find another guy, I'm sure it'll be alright
Sure hope you're alright, prolly wear a suit and tie
Don't you worry 'bout how I feel tonight
Girl, tomorrow I catch another flight
I'll be sitting by you, so we didn't try
I don't wanna cry, don't want butterflies
Girl, you gotta fly, said I love you, and I didn't lie

[Verse 2]
You're all I know (Know)
I still got your poems hangin' in my room
While I play this music
I can't find you at home, 'less I know you're gone
Summer's chasing away, and now you're losing

[Chorus]
Staring at the city lights on the bright side
(I don't wanna see you on the edge, fallen)
You'll find another guy, I'm sure it'll be alright
Sure hope you're alright, prolly wear a suit and tie
(I just wanna see you in my bed, I'm stalling)
Don't you worry 'bout how I feel tonight
(Baby girl, this love is not a game
Can't you see I'm still all in?)
Girl tomorrow I'll catch another flight
I'll be sitting by you, so we didn't try
(Life and death are really not the same)
Tryna make it right, tryna make a life
You tryna go and fly, so you gonna fly
You know

[Verse 3]
Harsh reality, soul fatality
Heart capacity, couldn't handle your audacity
Often they laugh at me, sweet tooth flow causin' a cavity
So I floss on these jokers, gotta carve out the casualties
And my wrist on water like the faucet attached to me
We a monster, a masterpiece
Just because this is our current situation
Doesn't mean that this is how it has to be
Things changes drastically, you was acting dramatic
I was just sitting here passively, contemplating my actions
I'm in the state where I really feel like we never happened
All I have is my raps and these crumpled poems in trash cans
In the back of your mom's house
Or the stairways in them New York apartments
When I was there, that was the hardest, girl
Those times were the darkest
You gave me the magic, a goddess
With all that Harry Potter shit
I hope one day you just stop and acknowledge this
I put my jacket down for you in the rain, that's only common sense
I try to fix all your problems even when I ain't cause 'em
And we working with our egos and we know that's colossal
And then we'll brush our love out the dust of the hills, like a fossil
I promise, Mazel Tov for the commas
At least my apologies aren't as poor as my partners'
When we just tryna get it popping
Never did get that semester in college
But I told professor this my synopsis

[Bridge]
I don't wanna see you on the edge, fallen
I just wanna see you in my bed, I'm stalling
Baby girl this love is not a game, can't you see I'm still all in?
I don't know why you still playin', can't you see I've been calling?
I don't wanna see you on the edge, fallen
I just wanna see you in my bed, I'm stalling
Baby girl this love is not a game, can't you see I'm still all in?
I know you still play with me

[Outro]
Girl, I'm rolling in The Hills, too focused on the mills
Wrote a poem 'bout a chandelier, sunset gleaming on the rings girl We can go do a lot of things
I know, me and you, we got a lot of dreams
Bottles in the East, and my legs feel weak
We can make it really brief, just so we can get a-
Baby girl, we need some sleep
You're the one I need to see
