We should hit the beach
With this dang effect on my voice
Man you probably think a joker can't speak
Into your blouse Imma reach
'Til we hit our peak
Talk about the album so much that it's kinda like it leaked
Damn that Jaden's a beast, like Grand Theft Auto with cheats
Then again you thought I was weak
Wear my heart on my sleeve so I get your daughters in sheets
Not the hardest MC but the only artist you see
Let's go to the beach, man let's roll in the streets
It's the coldest in the winter, only soldiers you see
A bunch of circles over here so you know that it's me
You wanna cry? Girl my shoulder is free

Let's get older and see
(Let me help you with your problems)
Let's get older and see
(I could probably show a thing or two)

Yeah let's get older and see the stars and the skies
The sun on horizon
Then look in my eyes
Don't worry 'bout what they're advertisin'
I keep you surprised cause you know I live all these lives
In different bodies, don't worry 'bout what joker's got ties in
You know the story of Poseidon?
Who do you think'll bring the tide in?
Who do you think'll make the waves wash up on the ground
While the joker's steady ridin' on my poetry
I tried to fight it but I'm glad I tried it
Keep that, no need to hide it, man I'm too excited
4th dimension, 3rd dimension, man I'm undecided
I ate all my enemies so now I got the itis
[?] when my path comes, I hope you light it
