[Hook]
Huh, Hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 1]
Like hello, my name is Jaden and I am a young fellow
I like to keep it mellow, I like to make friends and make trends
Attend young school dances, young romances
Girl this is your chance, it’s a long shot
Cupid tried to hit your bow but it’s a long shot
Because I’m tryin to rock the mic and no I won't stop
I’mma keep rappin’ ’bout this love until the song stops
Cause we’re just young and dumb and numb
And lung capacity flung from me in the last city
Um, hon? You one of the last pretty girls that ain’t cash greedy
Models thats mad skinny
You was that bad picky, girl that's a vegetarian
Who hated the movies and loved to go to aquariums
And she would just stare at it barely feeling embarrassed
She put the matic in charis who'd randomly fly to Paris like—

[Hook]
Huh, Hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 2]
Greetings this evening—hi, my name is Jaden
These girls are just so deceiving
They see me, they don’t believe I'm a minor
Well I don’t have any gold and all the records I've sold
They thinkin’ I’m really old but
No, I’m a teen, I’m still keeping it clean
I’m having meetings with deans
You see me up on the screen like
Hello, I’m doing this scene, a mean fighting machine
And still keeping it lean like woah
What does this mean? I’m seen in all of these places
My sister just got her braces
My MSFTS is breaking bases, it’s crazy
My clique's the top of the notches
Fans always tryna wave, so Moises is getting noxious
We at the shows, tryna make a mosh pit
Living life so exotic, I’m not tryna be obnoxious
And we trying to paint so now we go into Josh’s
Now we trying skate, we strappin’ on all the costumes like

[Hook]
Huh, hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 3]
They say Jaden your vocals, is so cool
Shuttin jokers down as soon as your clique rolls through
Man, we bringing back the old school
If I could, I’d do this without pro tools
Huh, but this is just a intro
Listen up homie if you want some info, I got some details
Sellin jokers out like they was some retails
Couple taxes and emails, talkin’ a lot about females
Hope that doesn’t concern you
Wanna' come up and battle
Well homie, I’mma just burn you
But you gon learn to respect it
You want a real emcee, then check this
Done, MSFTS
