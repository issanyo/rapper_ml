[Refrain]
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?

[Verse 1]
This is my anthem, this is my anthem
My baby, please don't throw a tantrum
I'd love if you'd answer
I'd love if you'd answer, my baby
You know I'm a Cancer, emotional
If I don't know, OSHO should know
Where im supposed to go
Out in the open, exposed
Take off my clothes, take off my clothes

[Interlude]
Whoa...
You don't wanna read a poem when you in the club
With your girls tryna get turnt
In the club with the girls, you in love with the girls
I noticed how you put the work in, girl
You the type of girl to say come through, and you never come
Guess a young thug gotta know what that means

[Bridge]
You just wanna have fun, girl
You don't wanna be the one, girl
You just wanna be a kid, girl
Show me how to live, girl
Girl, I just wanna be a kid, too
You ain't got a lot of issues
Show me how to act, girl
You don't never get mad, girl
But you ain't ever get happy, either
You ain't like that, girl
So in tune like binaural
You ain't care I got a side girl
You ain't like my girl

[Verse 2]
But I like you on the sly, girl
And let's keep it on the sly, girl
Cause on the weekend, I be sleeping with you, baby
We be peeking on a bike, girl
Get a bike, girl and a white girl
Nah, she come from Niburu (Ay)
You know I got you if you need a room (Hey)
Yeah, Jaden be a decent dude (Hey)
Pop out, peek-a-boo, in a cheetah suit
Like dang, girl, we be looking slayin' girl
Wanna watch a movie? Hit Fandango
Watch Django, there he go again, on the train slow
Eating mangoes, so sick broke your ankle
So playful, love learning, but I hate school
And the case is closed
I wander around with no place to go
With no place to go

[Refrain]
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?

[Verse 3]
You just wanna have fun, girl
You know what it is, girl
Show me what it is, girl
Show me, show biz, George Lopez
Four mopeds and my dream girl
Kinda lookin' like my dream, girl
Show you stuff you never seen, girl
Flow sick, nasty, show me how to keep it clean, girl
Sass just like a mean girl
Love you to the moon and nothing in-between, girl
Me and you are so introvert in this dark room
Got a couple poems for you in my arsenal
My cursive verses bend the frequencies
At least we'll see when you start to float
My heart is sold
I got a heart of gold, that turns to charcoal when I'm apart from yours
I'm 'bout to start the tour and my life is yours
You're up in France wearing bright couture

[Bridge] + [Refrain] (overlapping)
(Who am I?)
You just wanna have fun, girl
You don't wanna be the one, girl
You just wanna be a kid, girl
Show me how to live, girl
Girl, I just wanna be a kid, too
(Who am I?)
You ain't got a lot of issues
Show me how to act, girl
You don't never get mad, girl
But you ain't ever get happy, either
(Who am I?)
You ain't like that, girl
So in tune like binaural
You ain't care I got a side girl
You ain't like my girl
(Who am I?)

[Outro]
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl
