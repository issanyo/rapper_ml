[Intro]
Alfred
Could you please bring the car around...
Yeah
Yeah

[First Verse]
Batman, Batman, Batman
Im sorry im not that hero
Im not even a vigilante
Im more like sub zero
Batman, Batman, Batman
That's not even my name
Im never gonna be Bruce
Im never gonna be a Wayne
Batman, Batman, Batman
Don't look for the bat
Only look for the clowns
They got a girl with a bat
Batman, Batman, Batman
I don't need no signal
Put all calls to voicemail
Never walk on seashells
Batman, Batman, Batman
That's all I hear
Always looking out for Batman
While the joker always lives
Batman, Batman, Batman
You can never even be me
Now you wanna replace me
Got a Son who hates me

[Chorus]
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him

[Second Verse]
Honestly
I don't care about the profecy
Demons head ain't no legacy
Drinks Cold , no Hennessy
No lab, no enterprise, No honeys
No bad life, no interest , no Dead ties
No paparazzi
Just the cave and I
I know what you need
I know who you want
I'm sorry i ain't no kojo
But at least I always got the funds
People say that it's fun
Walking round as the chosen one
But I don't see the need
Especially acting like the other one
Batman, Batman, Batman
That's all I see
Going through all the articles
Is that all they believe
Batman, Batman, Batman
That was not part of the deal
You was protecting the bank
So how did you walk with a mill?

[Interlude]
Is that a question?
Your asking me if i walked off with mill
Alfred
Could you please bring the car around?

[Chorus]
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him

[Interlude]
Alfred, Back to the manor
Actually Alfred, One more thing..

[Chorus]
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him
Batman, Batman, Batman
I'm surrounded by jealousy
Haters working with my enemies
Mad cuz of my royalty
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
Pray to the lord That I get him (yah)
I swear down I wanna just get him
Pray to the lord That I get him

[Outro]
Thats it Alfred, Back to the manor
