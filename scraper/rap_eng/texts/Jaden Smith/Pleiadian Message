[Hook 4x]
Don't talk about it
Live about it
Be about it

[Verse 1:Teo]
Pause for a second
Let me dose for this method
That I've chose to present you
With the flow for this record
I'm about to channel a message that wasn't planned
So I hope that it's understandable If I turn to an animal
Pleiadian emissary of light
Welcome me to your planet I'm coming in from a flight
I'm looking right at a miracle being,Something imperial
Speaking right through this spiritual being
Whose individual
I've been moving through the ethers
Free of all of my features
Communicating silenced but really hoping to meet ya
And we're oh so ?
And your brothers from the beginning you've grown so fast
We've been waiting a minute for you to wake ?
That you live inside of a prison so you awaken your wisdom
And activate the sectors in your body
So you can feel that your godly
And turn this entire world into a body
Listen


[Hook 7x]

[Verse 2:Teo]
No worries we mean nothing disastrous
We can only enter the planet after you ask for us
We cannot interfere with the human evolution
So we have to witness everything you do with no intrusion
You sent
We're Beings of light ,beings of love
We lived through all of the hatred
Orbiting didn't make sense
Now we've embodied patience
And we live as these ancient beings
Sending you mesages from the future to take in
So take a little breather
Cause i don't want to make you a believer
I just want to guide you to the ether
Let your experience be a teacher
I'm just here to show you your something more than a creature
And you're one with reality
The only separation that you see is your anatomy
But I know that as soon as you rebel to the faculty
You gon that they're actually
Just afraid of your mastery
You've always been aware
I said you've always been aware

[Verse 3:Jaden]
Check it
Heartbroke Joe wrote a letter to parole
Officers in colarado
Said he dropped a damn bottle
In the Tahoe on the way to lake Tahoe
With some fine models
Keep in mind we sleep separate
Cross around my neck
Man the freaking priest left it
At the precinct after he told me he beat Tetris
You're freaking joking
I told that joker keep stepping
And he did but left behind his Louis V pendant
The youth is stressing
And we need some independence
From the deep end of the pool
Then pressed clean sentence for real
Ain't no actors here we only activists
Grab some MSFTS and give them care packages
Screw a platinum disc
This is music and it's coming from the soul
Screw the super bowl
Numbers in the goal
With Rolls Royce ghost
Cause before you know we all gon be some ghosts
But right now you got your voice so
Listen to the young boys,spit poise
No intermission
Taking nothing turn it to something
Magician in the room
I see you fishing for something giving you some worth
Take your ideas and put it on a shirt
And you'll fall real hard and trust it'll hurt
But you'll learn how to surf the rhythm of the earth
You've been here for a minute
I'm just skipping you your birth
So you know what your purpose is


You've always been aware
I said i-i-i I said you've always been aware
