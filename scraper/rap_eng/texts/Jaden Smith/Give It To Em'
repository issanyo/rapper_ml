[Intro]
Aah, I said aah
Said aah
I like this, aah

Hot spitter of the century
Said you wanted hot bars
So elected me
Young black with accessories
And I'm doing well
Never seen a penitentiary
Cause they can't sentence
The greatest MC they ever seen
No I'm not, but if you gon' battle me
Then you better be
Still got a couple million
Still in elementary
Talk about to blow
Eh, let them be

Just 13, tryin' to live my life
Got in trouble for it once
But I just did it twice
Man there goes Will's kid
Walking in the Hilton
And my name's Jaden
Get it right
But homie I'm just trying to spread some light
Ah so I can go to sleep at night
Cause right now I'm really restless
Flirting with my extras
Worryin' bout who was on the guest list
Who's rockin' wit nextest
Who's verse is the bestest
Is it competition?
Cause I'm surely gon' wreck this

Ah, ain't no doubt about it
Saw I was at the top
So all them jokers reroute it
All these people are crazy
These rumors is gettin' so crowded
That's just because we are famous
And you don't know nothing bout it

Ah, nothing has a price tag
In the back of my car
Soon as I say like that
You can take the fame
Homie just give the mic back
After you spit your optional verse
Cause they might clap
Yeah girl I know you like that
Jaden I'm a young boy
Killing on the right track
Yeah got some tricks up my sleeve
They were nice raps
I just wanna be there
When you takin' off that night cap

Yeah so call me when you tryna kick it
I'll be with Mateo
Livin' how all the bosses live it
Probably at Rodeo buying same
But the cost is diferrent
Louis is the tailor
But I gotta rock the Carsons with it

[Outro]
Skater at the heart
Artist at the soul
Lusting for these women
That's the hardest to control
And if you met me once
I'm no modest, I'm just cold
I'm so hot the sun is old
I ain't honest, I'm just bold
Give it to 'em
MSFTS, tell them I'm outta here
MSFTS
