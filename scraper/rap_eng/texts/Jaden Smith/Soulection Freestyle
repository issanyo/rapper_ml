[Pre-Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection, and what's your direction, shout out to Joekay
And tell me what's your soulection, and tell me what's your soul...

[Verse]
Check it
Heart broke Joe wrote a letter to parole officers in Colorado
Said he dropped the damn bottle
In the Tahoe, on the way to Lake Tahoe
With some fine models keep in mind we sleep sepearate
Cross around my neck
Man the freaking priest left it at the precinct, after he told me he beat tetris
You're freaking joking
I told that joker keep stepping and he did but he left behind his Louis V pendant
The youth is stressing
And we need some independence
From the deep end of the pool and press clean sentence, for real
Ain't no actors here we only activist
Grab some MSFT and give em care packages screw a platinum disk
This is music and it's coming from the soul
Screw the super bowl numbers in the gold with the Rolls Royce Ghost
Cause before you know we all gone be some ghost
But right now you got your voice
So listen to the young boy spit pois, no intermission
Taking nothing, turn it to something magician in the room
I see you fishing for something given use some worth
Take your ideas and put it on a shirt
And you'll fall real hard and trust me it'll hurt
But you'll learn how to surf the rhythm of the earth
And you've been here for a minute
I'm giving you your birth so you know what your purpose is...

[Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your direction
And tell me what's your aye
Tell me... And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your direction
Aye, aye shout out to Joekay
