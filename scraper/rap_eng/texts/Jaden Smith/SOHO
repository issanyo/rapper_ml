[Intro]
SoHo, I'm
I-I
SoHo, I'm
I-I

[Chorus]
Said she wanna go to SoHo (SoHo, SoHo)
I just took one sip, all them cars move in slow-mo (Slow-mo, slow-mo)
New supermodel bae, tryna keep it on the low-low (Super hush-hush)
Broke up with me one day, girl your heart's just so cold (Like so fucking cold)
Said that I'd give you the world and you turned it to a snow globe

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, baby now they takin' photos
Me and my red cup in the cut, girl, I'm solo, dolo
Head in the club, girl I won't go
I got niggas looking for me, comin' for my whole soul (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Tryna get me, they think they slicky, I'm on road though
I got all those sexy pictures of you wearin' no clothes (No clothes)
I don't post those, you know the flow so cold
This mic froze over 'cause he know I'm Frozone
Everything I wear on the air is the wardrobe (Woah)
Fuck the po-po, bounce this like pogo
See what you do to me bae, I'm loco
Hit me on the phone (Yuh, ayy)

[Chorus]
Said she wanna go to SoHo (Oh)
She said I'm sick of chillin', sittin' in The Hills readin' Osho (SoHo)
She said I wanna go to Paris and I want a real kimono (Oh)
Or get it poppin' with my partners (Yuh), swear we gotta feel the mojo (SoHo)
Don't got that counterfeited swag (Yeah), fuck a wish, that's a no-no (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
We got orange jam in a new whip, finna orange it
Man, think I'm 'bout to go to Florence then (Damn)
On my foreign shit (Yeah), you endorsin' it (Yeah)
It was porcelain, I had a competition and a tournament
I was chillin', hangin' like an ornament
The poets asked me, am I bored of this?
Bored of this, borderline torturous
The way your voice comes through your lips, I-

[Bridge]
I'm close and I'm so far tonight
(You always have been)
'Til morning time, your soul is yours and mine
(My biggest, my inspiration)
No courtside, ooh, oh

[Chorus]
Said she wanna go to SoHo (Yeah, ayy)
I just took one sip, all them cars move in slow-mo (Slow-mo, slow-mo)
New supermodel bae, try to keep it on the low-low (Super hush hush)
Broke up with me one day, girl your heart's just so cold (Like so fucking cold)
Said that I'd give you the world and you turned it to a snow globe

[Outro]
I don't fall in love with most people, but I just love you
Love your eyes, I just had to say that
Told her her eyes are good
Of course, this could be bad for us
