[Intro]
(Yeah, just go through the back)
Ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh (No, we got the mimosas)
Girl standby, it's time, 'bout to blow up like a landmine
Girl standby (Standby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl standby (Standby), it's time, 'bout to blow up like a landmine
That you can't find (Can't find)
You and I
Girl standby, on the beach, got my hands tied (Hands tied)
Going off like a landmine (Landmine)
Thoughts that I can't find (Can't find)
Girl standby (Standby), standby (Standby)

[Verse]
I got the moon dust, see your body movin', oh
Got my hands tied, oh, landline (Landline)
Got some problems that I can't find (Can't find)
On the beach, hands tied (Hands tied, get it, get it, get it, let's go)
Girl, we could cause a headline, take you to the sunlight
All my nights
You take all my soul right now, don't know why (Don't know why)
We the ones on the row boats in the water, we want no problem
Drink it all on the boats in the water, we want no problems
Standby, standby (Get it, get it)
(I'm not comin' down until I know you're not)
Going up, landmine, got your hand now, standby (Standby)
Channel swish, they don't miss (Swish God on the list)
That's a gift, this is it (It, yeah)
We don't trip, triple flip (Flip it, oh my, triple flip)
Misfits, that's the clique (Oh, standby)
Like a landline (Go, go, go, get it, get it, get it)
Talkin' bout no problems that I can't find (Can't find it)
Water on the beach, landmine (Water)
Don't gotta drip like this
Ooh, standby
It's a lullaby, ooh, ooh it's a lullaby
We wanna fly, look on the fly, jump in the sky
Found this how
We found this, the sky, we fly
Fly boundless, boundless, boundless
Fountains (Fountains), the mountains (Mountains)
Mountains (Mountains), stuck in the mountains
Stuck in my own ways, stuck in the hallways always (Always)
All days blend, make one then
Mountains, fountains, around them (All around them)
I got the water, why am I drowning?
Mountains, mountains, fountains, allow this
How'd we allow this? It's crowded (Crowded)
(Dyin') Thousands (Cryin') about them
Rerouting (Tryin'), there's thousands (Fountains)
Frozen, oh (Hopeless)
How could I say?
Fish are falling from the sky, my eyes see four ways (Ways)
Blood flowing in the rivers, now my mouth your name (Your name)
Carve those letters in my leg, tryna feel your pain, girl (Pain)
I look the same, I'm not the same (Erys, I'm not the same)
Tell me, has the valley changed, girl?
Have I been walkin' through your brain, girl?
I think I'm goin' through a change (Change)
Sunset's still feeling afraid
Tryna tell me she don't feel anything
Wait 'til the sky turns pink (Pink)
Soon you'll see why I'm boundless
Flying, boundless (Let's ust lay down up here)
Flying (It's just up that road), mountains
I know my stomach hurts (My stomach hurts too)
Mountains
Mountains
