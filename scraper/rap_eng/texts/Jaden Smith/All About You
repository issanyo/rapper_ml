Damn Brandon...

[Verse 1: Brandon Thomas]
I need to be loud like the loudest loud you've ever smoked
Like 8th grade heat
I'm gon' live it up, I'm gon' live it up, we gon' live it up
But can I
I'm gon' live it up
Need more than enough, cause enough ain't enough
I know what you need
Solo pull up in the rush
Music give me that rush
Tryna position myself like clutch
Through listening to these fucking hypocrites though I appreciate the criticism
Soak it in like dye on denim
I don't know just why we winning
I guess it's like the cauldron of the confidence mixed with superstitions
I know you're tripping like how we stitched it it properly fitting, fitted like my tailored bridges
The major mission
Tryna change the game, we make the lane open for niggas who  wanted to try and get it
Cause they desire to be different
Inspired by the lifestyles of dreamers out here gettin' it

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Girl I hate when you go away
Probably someone down on Ninth Ave and she said she want  a photo
Pulling off in the white cab I don't know that they had those
Probably balling up in michi if not then we finna hit mad strokes, that shit, that's all, that shit, that's all...
You standing close to me I might not be where I supposed to be, yikes
Hate doing interviews with all these niggas that's suppose to be nice, yeah
I'm gone for the night?
That was the question we need re-election here
I'm gone for the night?
That was the question we need re-election here

[Outro x2: Jaden Smith]
It's all about you, hey
Lately it's all about you, hey
