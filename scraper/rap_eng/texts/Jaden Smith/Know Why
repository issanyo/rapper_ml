[Intro]
What you doing here?
Girl, who let you here?
Can I whisper in your ear?
Cause I really kinda need you near
And my mom said you couldn’t come over
Didn't really care when you pulled up in the rover
Said that I should wait, wait till I got older
But love is a war and maybe I’m your soldier (swag)

[Verse 1]
At the crib like you’re here to see Willow
Everybody know that you’re here to see Smith-o
Willow's been in Philly for the last couple weeks
She’s just chilling there with Gammy
Cause she really loves the east
But I’m in Cali where the sun come
The city of angels and trust me baby, you’re one of them
Upcoming artist? I’m sorry, I don’t know none of em
Msfts tee, I’m sorry hun if you wanted one
I’m just playin, you can have it
Most exclusive jacket that we've got
Don’t worry girl, you can swag it
I be looking dumb? Sorry girl, that’s a habit
Your body was just around, you make me wanna come grab it
People say my lyrics are explicit
But really they're just vivid
Cause when I hang with you I’m always thinkin bout kissing
And my house is like a heaven, I’d love for you to come visit
And listen.. to the smooth track
Aye girl, get your dude back
Man, why’d you go and do that?
Get up in my face and you ruined the mood up
Jeez, told the girl “don’t worry”
I can get him gone, I just got to tell Siri
Security came running through the hall in a hurry
And took em so fast, it was almost kinda blurry, see?

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why


[Verse 2]
I got what you need, come take it if you want
Girl, come make it if you want
I don’t care what you wear, come if you want
Even though I couldn’t say it it’s basically what I want
So.. I’m just bugging girl
But the funny part is you know that I wasn’t, girl
I’m just really lonely, I need someone’s loving girl
And you make me so hot
And that’s why it feels like an oven girl
And I think I know why

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why

[Interlude]
Aye girl, if you up your room right now
Listen to this song—I’m right there with you
Just let me hold you, take my hand
Just rock with me, girl, just rock with—

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why

[Verse 3]
Put your head up on my shoulder
"Girl I’m bout to kiss you"—yeah, that’s what I told her
So we getting close, only getting closer
And I’m waiting for the kiss till I said “hold up”
I’m O.K. that you are older
I just need you on my side when I roll up in that Bentley
And these jokers just resent me
When you met me I was empty
And I’m bout to win a Grammy and these jockers wanna friend me but I’m gone now
