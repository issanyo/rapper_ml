[Hook]
Is it butterflies for the first time?
First time, first time
I feel like I can fly for the first time
First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for?

[Verse 1]
Girl this love hurts
And you were my first
And deep down inside I hope you're my last one
I just hope that we're ok when all of this cash comes
Cause we know it's coming
My money's runnin (runnin)
My money's runnin (runnin)
Girl our future is as sunny
Girl I really like it, you ain't askin nothing from me
And it's funny
Baby won't you just come here and be my honey (be my honey baby)
Baby you drivin me crazy
Making me so hot when you roll up in that 'Cedes
Girl you are so fine, blow me back into the 80's
And I like your dirty dancing, let me be your Patrick Swayze (Patrick Swayze)
Girl you're pretty as a daisy
You be my Beyonce and I be your Jay-z
I can be your wolf girl, you can be my Haley
And I asked you why you runnin'
You said just so you can chase me
And let's have a good time

First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for? Is it?

[Verse 2]
Is it?
It doesn't make a difference to me girl so just listen
Cause this is something that you get in your dreams girl
You're so pretty
I'm hanging with you but I'm so busy
And it's so trippy
That were moving so fast in such a slow city
But you said baby lay me down
I don't even know when this is crazy wild
This love was hot and now you about to take me down
You got some secrets well baby girl you should say them now
Cause the sun is setting on the beach
And it's probly gon' get chilly
Well, good thing I brought some sheets
Baby girl you are so pretty, I don't think we'll ever leave
I don't know what's gonna happen
Guess we'll have to wait and see
Cause I got them butterflies

[Verse 3]
What is pure?
People walk around so insecure
Fraid that you said the word it, it hurts
As soon as you had your first it's like you bearing a curse
But girl I'll protect you
I'm always next to you girl
I respect you
I'll never let you loose No
Girl I'll never let you
If you run away best believe I'mma come get you
Girl I bring you love ever since I met you
I remember you were sneezing
You said achu I said bless you
I'll just get you, uhh
Girl, and I know you get me
Ever since you met me
All those texts you sent me
Wasn't lookin for love, just lookin for someone friendly
And I got it, I was younger
I was asking for a Bentley and I got it
Now we're vibin super sexy
And she's textin while we drivin
Want some Ti$a, want some Gucci
Want some Fendi then we got it
