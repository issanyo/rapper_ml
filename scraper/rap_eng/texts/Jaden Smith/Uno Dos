(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

[Chorus: ¿Téo?]
Your scars show you signs
Your love's only blind when you
Lose track of time

[Verse 1: ¿Téo?]
Delay, delay the story, delay (Delay)
Away, we going away
In time I said I
Can't hold you down again, my baby
Hold you down again, I won't
'Round again we rollin' and around again we go
I know you've grown wings from your pain
Ay-ya-yai

[Bridge: ¿Téo?]
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
My love, my love, mi amor

[Chorus: ¿Téo?]
Your scars show you sun
Your love's only blind when you
Lose track of time
Ay-ya-yai

[Verse 2: ¿Téo?]
Ay, qué rabia, oh
I need time alone (Por favor)
I'll be fine, I'm sure
She loped me up and on
She got me down and sedated
Hopped on my—and fellated
I know it's a bit overrated
Your better off if we waited
We're better off when we faded
She like to say we're related
Her body's a temple, it's gated
I'm 'bout to run up on the crib and grenade it (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
In Medellín, I need a finca
And a sexy mamacita
You look good in those adidas
Tell the paparazzi "please stop"
And we ain't even packin heaters
Applebum like Bonita
Marinilla, if you need us
She whisper "papi" like a secret  (Oh)
These white jokers always lyin' well
Got that boss for them that's my clientele
Man, I got a secret I will never tell
Last one I did, saw him die in jail
But, I'm by the pool living hella well
Got SYRE coming and they well aware
Then I'm on the way straight to Delaware
Man, you always winning you should try and fail
MSFTS music, they losin'

[Outro: ¿Téo?]
Soarin', my love
My love, mi amor
