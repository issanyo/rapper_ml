[Chorus]
You were all there was when I caught up, so you drive away
She caught my love, I can smell you from a mile away
I feel your touch when I wake and when I go to sleep
I lost your trust, is there really much that I can say?
Yellin' at the world, tellin’ it to slow down
I'm parked outside your house
Just thinkin' ’bout the thousand times
We met up on the mountainside
Don't give up on me now
Talk or walk or we rollin' around

[Verse 1]
You know I'm new in town, girl
Don't know where I'm at, bae, I need you around
She move to the sound, so we hit up and down (Fun)
They laugh, I'm not no clown, girl
'Less I go to Harlem, I don’t go uptown
You’re a diamond in the rough, people look what I found
Ooh, I love those moves
Tequila with the juice, mix it all with the music
They off high, up in the sky
I'm up every night, we need compromise (Compromise, alright)
You had other guys, but they weren’t wise to leave you tonight (Tonight)
When I lie in my bed, you'll be by my side, tonight
When I'm fly in my head, I get butterflies
She said "Real eyes, realize all your little lies"
Well, let me say just how I feel inside

[Chorus]
You were all there was when I caught up, so you drive away
She caught my love, I can smell you from a mile away
I feel your touch when I wake and when I go to sleep
I lost your trust, is there really much that I can say?
Yellin' at the world, tellin’ it to slow down (Slow down)
I'm parked outside your house (Ohh-ah)
Just thinkin' 'bout the thousand times
We met up on the mountainside
Don't give up on me now (Now, uh)
Talk or walk or we rollin' around (Ohh)
