[Intro]
Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown

[Verse 1]
Come groove with the coolest kids in school
Make them other dudes look foolish
Watch me while I do this
I don’t care what the mood is
Baby girl we should rock and roll
Send some kids to the hospital
I mean we gots to go
When I lead it’s impossible
Want some games? Yea I got some more
A little dance won’t hurt you
Play tracks til the curfew
Girl touch upon my curls and they tuck em on my virtue
Me and you should be the first to
Let’s take it with me
Girl I really wanna kiss you
Caus I’m really gonna miss you
Said this dude
In a way don’t worry cuz my eyes are getting blurry
Baby girl so..

[Hook]
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, golden
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, kings and queens

[Verse 2]
Let’s screw to the evening
Baby sooner to believe in Bob and Evan
Do the crowd cause they all screaming loud
But girl and I leaving
I don’t even got a reason
To step away from your beauty cause you’re looking like a movie
Take my hand if you’re really feeling groovy
You could leave now if you knew me but you don’t so
Let’s take you vanish
Wash away my hands and don’t roll the cameras
I like my campus, watch where my fans is
Let’s play the jams and we start the dancing
Chill backstreet relaxing
And off the dorm right now, that’s my passion
On the moon, moonwalking like Jackson
And I see you, just you doing my glasses

[Hook]
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, golden
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, kings and queens

[Verse 3]
Girl I really wanna groove
Baby lookin' when we groove
You be kissin' when we groove
I be touchin' when we groove
And I’m lookin' so smooth
And we got nothing to lose
Come kick it with the crew
I don’t know what you wanna do with me girl but I think you’re tryna (groove)

[Hook]
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, golden
All I see is you, stars, open arms, pharaohs, God, kings and queens
