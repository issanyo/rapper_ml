It’s a ..
It’s been a.. it’s been a second since I seen you
And uh.. when I get my own place I guess we’re
Gonna kick it again but..
I don’t really know
What’s right for us cuz..
Mateo is tryna..
I mean we’re all kinda...
Miss what all of us had before and I’m not
Saying that..
I’m begging for your back that is

(First Verse)
I dropped a song our anniversary
Half of your friends ain’t even heard of me
They know me as a kid.. that’s more closed than the curtains be
You want me back, well that’s working out perfectly
Your lips are just so perfect and it hurts to be the kid that broke your heart
It’s not on purpose man
I done it since the nursery
Do you like me? Well certainly
And then she falls in love
And it’s kinda like a curse for me
I don’t say this stuff with certainty
I just wanna have fun
There’s no need for all the urgency
Cuz these ladies always burning me
I’m learning every time that I’m concerned it’s an emergency
But girl I’d rather go emergencies
And feel your body cuz I know you’re been in search of me
Girl it’s been a while so now I know that you’re sure with me
So come and take my hand
Cuz I wanna be the first to be with you

(Chorus)
Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it’s getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

She’s not around
She’s not around babe
She’s not around
She’s not around baby
She’s not around
She’s not around baby
She’s not around
She’s not around right now
She’s not around

(Second Verse)
I think I’m liking someone else
But I don’t wanna hurt you so I’m right here by myself
And I think that I’mma search you on the social media
Giddy up, straight meeting up
Chilling with your sister
Bout to text, you say I miss you but..
A joker’s talking with his fist up
Cuz now I got you mad bout them numbers that I picked up
But I ain’t even messing with nobody
Chest is heavy, I ain’t been confessing to nobody
Man you know they know we broke up
They ain't let me see they body
This girl told me, she said texting me’s a hobby
And of course Kennedy mad
Man she mad all the time
Like all my enemies mad
She’s so mad, she probly pretend to be mad
But it’s really sad for your oldest friend to be sad
But at least I said all my goodbyes
So she has a bit of closure in the pillow when she cries
But I’m sorry

(Chores)
(Chorus)
Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it’s getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much
You can take it off if it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
We don’t gotta do much
Tell me if it’s..

If it’s too much
Then I’ll just hold you and unfold you til I can find the old you
When we were so connected
Our privacy so protected, my thoughts are getting so hectic
Words carefully selected
Teens love each other so reckless
I couldn’t say where my head is
Is it too much?
Cuz if it is we can take our broken hearts right up the stairs
Ignorin all our peers
We hide the fact that we some secret lovers
But we show it all, we’ll be under the covers
Baby girl cuz..

If it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much
You can take it off if it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much, if it’s too much

If it’s too much I’ll put my hand right down your face and make it to your waist
Baby girl cuz if it’s too much
You won't have nothing to chase
Won't even have no space
Baby girl cuz this is too much
So my lips is what you’ll taste
And if it’s too much
We gon do it how we did it
Up on zoomer baby girl
But is it..?

Too much
Is too much
Baby is it too much?
Is it too much? Tell me if it’s too much
Baby is it too much? Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Don’t be worried when it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Tell me if it’s..
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Cuz I got it if it’s too much
We can take it if it’s..
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
Let’s spend a couple weeks
So we got it if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Too much
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
It’s too much....
