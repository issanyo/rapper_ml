[Verse 1: Goody Grace]
Well, I remember, drivin' around
Tryna think of each and every way that I could maybe get my ass up out this town
And I remember, it wasn't long ago
I used to tell my momma "stop with the yelling, a normal job isn't why I'm in this world"

[Pre-Chorus: Goody Grace]
And I remember coming home at night hoping I don't smell like smoke
Telling my momma "don't worry, one day we ain't gonna be broke"
I'ma pay the bills with these six strings, just watch me
And now I'm on a roll and nobody can stop me

[Chorus: Goody Grace & Jesse Rutherford]
Well, I was so low
But now I'm high in California
Well, I was so low
But now I'm gettin' high in California
Well, I was so low, low, low, low, low (I was so low)
But now I (yeah)
Well, now I'm gettin' high in California (oh)

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford & Jaden Smith]
I used to pray that one day maybe you might save me and we'd get out of here, oh
Now I'm racing, almost famous, I feel like I've made it there
So close but I'm still not in the right spot (yeah)
I was born in California where the women and the weather too hot (oh)
Yeah, I've got a little but I'm really itchin' for a whole lot (yeah)
But when you start tearing it up they start rippin' you off
I hear what they say (I hear it) and I know what they do (I do)
Yeah, they call up on you (brrt) and they say that you're cool (ay)
So you give 'em your best, yeah, and they go and they flex, yeah
But I just smoke it off when I get back to the west side

[Chorus: Goody Grace & Jesse Rutherford]
Well I was so low
But now I'm gettin' high in California
Well I was so low
(Too many paths, got too many paths)
But now I'm gettin' high in California
Well I was so low, low, low, low, low
(Too many paths, hope they remember me)
But now
Well now I'm gettin' high in California
