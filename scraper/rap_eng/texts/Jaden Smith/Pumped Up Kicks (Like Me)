{Verse 1}
Uh, Yo, Aye
Spit fire can't jock my heat
Hear my spit fire knock the streets, yo
Tic toc can't stop my feet
Hear a real G rock the beat, uh
Had a fun time last night
Got girls here that's right
Could've chilled if you act right
Fell asleep on my half-pipe, yeah
Got school but we coolin', Aye
Let the cool kids do this, uh
And flows be too sick, eh
So cool you droolin', yup
Yup, yup I does it
This my city right here

Pass me a deck quick, quick pop shovit
Girls be sayin' I was with 'em but I wasn't
Cause...

{Hook}
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Why, Everybody tryna get like me

{Verse 2}
Wanna know where to find me
Find a place where the most skateboards, scrape concrete
With my G's behind me, yeah
We ain't afraid of non the zombies
More peace than Gandhi
Up all night, never sleep
You can call me a zombie, Ah
Bringin' it way back
Before I got to cruise
With my dad playin' tracks in the Maybach
Now I'm king of the MSFTS
So are my G's
Moi's king of the kick-flips (Dope)
And must be the raps I spit
To get invited to these parties
With all these hot actresses, yo
I ain't even mad at this
But, I'll probably get some crap for this
From parents and my sis
And the people I be actin' with
But it's cool Ima act a trip
Cause...

{Verse 3}
People say "be safe" and I hate that
So I go to skatelab with no pads
Ha, ha rebel
Ever skate hard betta get up on our level
If you can't then it's no problem
If you want decks then we got 'em
Lookin' up like there's no bottom
Spittin' flows hotter than lava
New York meetings with Hova
Then go to Nobu with Shaka
These girls are thinkin' I'm older
Then break it to 'em shock 'em
Told you I was the realest
Swag bustin' through ceilings
And O told me to kill it
So what did I do I killed it
Cause...
