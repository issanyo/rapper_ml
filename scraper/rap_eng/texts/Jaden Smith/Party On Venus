[Verse 1]
Here we go again in the stars with
The flying cars and, the Martians
Someone get my ray gun cuz it’s time to start this
Our beat’s the hardest
Give me a star kiss
And it feels like a light year but baby girl I’m right here
I could die here
Let’s start this party
Nobody started
And I’m rockin my cardigan
We could stop, we could start again
And in my heart’s a friend and you knew it
(What are you tryin’ to tell us?)
We had love and we threw it, off the ledge
I’m off my head, my heart’s obsessed
It’s all my good

[Bridge]
Then come dance at midnight, you’ll have a good time if you know how to live right
I’m coming to get you
Oh you have to get ready cuz it’s time for lift off
Then come dance at midnight, you’ll have a good time if you know how to live right
I’m coming to get you
Oh you have to get ready cuz it’s time for lift off

So dark with my shades
And I’m so under-aged
But I’m just tryin’ to rage cuz I

We should get busy tonight
Kickin electricity night
We bout to dance in the stars of the city tonight cuz
