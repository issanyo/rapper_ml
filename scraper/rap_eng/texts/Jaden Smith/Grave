[Verse 1: Ian Frequency]
MSFTS okay (okay)
You can come hop on the wave (wave)
Last year was diggin' the grave (grave)
Gotta set the bar up high (high)
Pavin' the way for my guys (my guys)
Maybe we go, we on the rise (rise)
See us flyin' through the sky (sky)
We boutta tear up the floors (floors)
KD with no award (awar)
Zora with no sword
You eavesdrop when I hit up TÃ©o
When I touch down callin' me Odell
I ain't been to jail but I been to hell
Over see a farewell (farewell)
Somethin' like a wishin' well (well)
Heartbreak hotel

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Man I swear my boy Ian on a new level
Let's get it...
Lost boys, thought I told you niggas
Man I swear to God they don't ever listen
Man I got the keys they in the ignition, but I only whip it when I'm in the kitchen
Just saw Jaden in the ghost "Man didn't know you was superstitious"
Been on the moon for a minute
I just hope God will forgive us, lets go

[Verse 3: Ian Frequency & Jaden Smith]
You can come hop on the wave (wave)
Imma' get you out the way (way)
High-five or a wave (wave)
Uh, 8, 9, 10 (10)
Say my name and come again (again)
Say they wanna be my friend (friend)
One of the MSFTS fake (fake), have Jaden hit em' with the cape
Eat all the food on the plate (the plate)
Yeah, 9 minus 8 (8)
One man is unique (unique)
Fell in love in a day (a day)
Heartbreak in a month (a month)
Phone calls in a week (a week)
Overseas in a year (a year)
Now the future so unclear

[Outro: Ian Frequency}
Yuh
Imma put you on the wave
