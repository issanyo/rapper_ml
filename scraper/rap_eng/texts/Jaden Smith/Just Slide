[Verse 1: Harry Hudson]
Tell me if you love me, tell me if you understand
(Tell me if you understand)
I just need somebody, even if I ain't your man
(Even if I ain't your man)
You gave me your body, I gave you the upper hand
(You gave me your body, I gave you the upper hand)
So tell me if you love me, tell me if you understand

[Chorus: Harry Hudson & Jaden Smith & Both]
If you feel something
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
I hope you feel something

[Verse 2: Harry Hudson]
Telling everybody, even if they ain't your friends
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Even if they ain't your-)
Mad 'cause I want it bad and you never gave me a chance
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(You never gave me a-)
It gets messy in the dark, still I can't erase your name
(Still I can't erase your-)
So tell me if you love me, I don't think you understand

[Chorus: Harry Hudson]
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
I hope you feel something (feel something)

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
If you feel something, then just slide, I'll be outside
If you feel something, hit my line, girl it's our time

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
If you ever need a friend, we can make it intimate
Girl I know you got a man, but we only talkin'
Love when you vent to me, I'll be honest
Hate saying bye to you it's the hardest
Oh she's a goddess, one day they'll tell our
Story, I promise
Aye, on the beach I found a message in a bottle and I
Wrote it to you, I was crying in Toronto one night
Lying in bed, hiding all of my sorrows, your eyes
Keep me going, girl without you I could never survive
You ain't hit me back tonight but tomorrow if you

[Chorus: Harry Hudson]
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something (feel something)
Then just slide, then just slide
If you feel something
I hope you feel something
