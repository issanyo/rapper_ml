{Intro}
(Piano Playing)

{Verse 1}
To be honest
My conscience is givin' me caution
I'm dealin' with all this nonsense
To be honest...
I'm talkin' to all my aunts and they givin' me bad responses
Girl, Imma be honest....
They got trickery in their pockets
Their hearts are blacker than onyx
And girl, let's just be honest...
I feel like I'm on narcotics
With you I feel so erotic
You know I'm a workaholic...
If your finger nails are still polish
You're plannin' to go to college
Then we shouldn't have to worry...
But you live your life in a hurry
You droppin' out so it's blurry
We fallin' down in a flurry
You serious
You go through these periods
Where you hang with these eerie kids
It's hilarious...
And you call me while you delirous
And tell me how's it goin'
And then I start to get furious
You go up in your room play Sia
Light a candle
I play Bella's Lullaby, while I cry on the piano
People question did I love her
Just know it cuts deeper
Then what all them bracelets cover
And that's very true
And this ain't another cover
This to uncover
All the magic that has happened in the summer
And girl you'll always be my lover
But then the time will come
When you go and find another
But You'll always be my Star

{Hook - Talking}
(Yeah, girl you'll always be my Star)
Man, I remember
(Trust me, you'll always be my Star)
Back in, I don't even remember how old I was
(Girl, you'll always be my Star)
But...
(You'll always be my Star)
(Girl no matter where you are)
(Trust me, you'll always be my Star)
I might of been like 8 when I had my first girlfriend...
Yeah, I guess I've been messin' up ever since...
I don't do it on purpose so...
I guess, I don't know if it's me

{Verse 2}
I want somebody
That can touch my body
Who's lovin' everybody
But's lovin' nobody but me
And nobody can see
What me and her are doin'
On our spare time
That was our time
It isn't their time
And I'm just happy cause it's over
And I'm not the one to looking over my shoulder
Keep it movin' forward
If I'm lookin back I'm gonna cry
And she told that I'm really just selfish kind of guy, uh
Well I guess she know me best
But it didn't feel like it
When her hands were on my chest
I guess, that Costa Rica and Philly was very selfish of me
Well I'm sorry
Girl I'm just silly
And I feel helpless if that's true
Because you know that I'm really so very lonely
When your gone, and we were chillin' until we
Broke Up...
Know what, you was there when I woke up
Got emotions that we can soak up
Girl I can be your soldier
Girl I promise that
And I'll never take that promise back
It wasn't for you I would just kinda rap
Prince Charmin' may come one day
And girl I'm fine with that
But you'll always be my star

{Hook - Outro}
You'll always be my Star
You'll always be my Star
Girl, no matter where you are
Trust me, you'll always be my Star
Girl, you'll always be my Star
You know that
You'll always be my...
Girl you'll always be my star
(Piano Playing)
Cause this room is really starry
This is me tellin' every girl I dated that I'm sorry
Yeah, It's really starry
This is me tellin' every girl I dated that I'm sorry
Soph, girl I'm sorry
This is me tellin' every girl I dated that I'm sorry
Kennedy, girl I'm sorry
This is me tellin' all them other girls that I'm just sorry
Cause, man this room is really starry...
Man I'm sorry
Girl you know I'm sorry
Man, this room is really starry
Rachel, girl I'm sorry
Man this room just so starry
This time is just so starry
Man, it's bright outside
But girl in here is really starry

But this room is so...
