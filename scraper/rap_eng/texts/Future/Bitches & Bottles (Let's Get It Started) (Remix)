[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Ok, now lil' nigga
My clique realer
Thick as fuck. I'm a big tipper
In the club 'bout 20 bottles
I make a movie like Ben Stiller
Chase money, don't chase hoes
That peach Ciroc, I'm on straight liquor
Neck froze like cold winter
Stand by me in need a chinchilla
Presidential got plenty rocks
Roc boy like I know Jigga
Riding off in that new shit
I told the dealer you can keep the ceiling
Plenty bitches wanna get the business
I told them it's my dick decision
Goons with me, need supervision
Murk ya dog if it's slight tension
I hit once and my mind gone
Tipper's short but my dreads long
See a star come make a wish
Come take a flick with ya camera phone
I'm in the club and I'm turnt to the max
Better be pretty, I'm turning 'em back
Clique full of riders you know where they at
R.I.P. Chris, I'ma end it with that

[Hook - Future]
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Girl there's other precautions, get the car it's inside it
