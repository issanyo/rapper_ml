Just last week, just last week

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T. & Future]
Just last week I had to ball on em
Just last week I had to ball on em

Sit tall on em, Crawl on em
Today I’m on, today I’m on
Today I’m on
Just last week I had to ball on em
Today I’m on, today I’m on
Today I’m on
Just last week I had to ball on em

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Just last week I had to run up on a nigga like, where that money you owe me?
Say you got it, well show me
Look up ho, you know me
Pull up, hop out, clean
Everybody wanna be a pimp nowaday
But don’t nobody wanna break a ho
Kick a do’ when the plane don’t fly
Get your blimp nowadays
So, waddup dawg?
Ain’t nothing changed since the pimp went broke
Even I still ride old school, paint ready like Archie Eversole
Slab it out, work it on
Banging that Screw for them niggas that don't know 'bout it
I was whippin through the game like nigga how could you doubt me?
Hold up

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm talkin' bout hay in the middle of the barn
Sippin' on all that oil, blowin' on that napalm
That fire, ho, motherfuck all my rivals
Same niggas talkin' shit 'bout me won't ride fo', but I'll slide fo'
What I believe, don't trip, let the trunk bang
I'm still a country motherfucker, shawty, I'm gettin' head while I'm grippin' grain
I spend a grip on a pinky ring, I blew a tire, threw the car away
I did it big in the club last night, but a nigga goin' hard today
