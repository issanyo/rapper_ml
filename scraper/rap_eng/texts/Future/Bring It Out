[Chorus: Future]
I got a thing in the car, I'm boutta bring it out
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout nigga, we gotta bang it out
I keep my bitch in the house, I'm boutta bring her out
I got whips on whips this year, I'm bout to bring 'em out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bang it out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bring it out
I put the mat on the rarri, I'm boutta bring it out
We don't talk back to no cops, we just air you out

[Post-Chorus: Future]
If you ain't spraying for the gang then we puttin' you out
I got my chains inside my shirt, don't make me bring one out
I got that thing, exotic car, don't make me bring it out
I put 'em burkins in the closet, told her bring one out, hah

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Whip that soda, ice like polar
Double on motor on the motorola
Got your main thing, take her to boa
Took her to the crib, made her do yoga
I got bitches I know that you ain't even seen yet
Got the 488 you ain't see yet
These rappers gonna make me pull out my tennis chain
I'm back and forth with my hoes like a tennis game (Serena)
I'm killin' niggas GYG, I put 'em in the hearse
My bitch killin' you hoes, you know she had it first (she got it)
I got 'em guns I do the most, yeah I love to roast
I could've got the Wraith, but it can't fit my hoes
I came up way up out the mud and turned up like a key
I hit the club and valet tell me I can keep my key (you got it)
I'll shoot it out with all these niggas I don't give a fuck
I got a hundred niggas with me, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Future]
I got a thing in the car, I'm boutta bring it out
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout nigga, we gotta bang it out
I keep my bitch in the house, I'm boutta bring her out
I got whips on whips this year, I'm bout to bring 'em out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bang it out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bring it out
I put the mat on the rarri, I'm boutta bring it out
We don't talk back to no cops, we just air you out

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Big face rollie, still rock [?]
Air 15, leave a nigga hold up
Got a lotta cash, still move fast
Dope in the pot, spoon in the trash
I'm addicted to the pace, I'm a trap nigga
Why you talk behind my back, you should act nigga
Make the money come back like a lap nigga
Treat you like you did good cause I clap niggas
I got shooters on deck and its real fun
Put your fingers in the air, get a real gun
Heard you got a bitch nigga, get a trill one
Couple days in a month I hit a million
I done had too much to drink, I done fell on her
Had a threesome with my bitch, put Chanel on her
I'm still married to the game, got my ring, yeah
Long clip beat hit his bitch, we can bang out

[Chorus: Future]
I got a thing in the car, I'm boutta bring it out
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout nigga, we gotta bang it out
I keep my bitch in the house, I'm boutta bring her out
I got whips on whips this year, I'm bout to bring 'em out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bang it out
I'm boutta bang it out, I'm boutta bring it out
I put the mat on the rarri, I'm boutta bring it out
We don't talk back to no cops, we just air 'em out

[Post-Chorus: Future]
If you ain't spraying for the gang then we puttin' you out
I got my jammers inside my shirt, don't make me bring one out
I got that thing, exotic car, don't make me bring it out
I put 'em burkins in the closet, told her bring one out, hah
