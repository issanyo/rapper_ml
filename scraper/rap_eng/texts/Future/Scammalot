[Intro]
Drip sale
We got more drip
More, more, more, more, more

[Pre-Chorus]
Lil shorty broke my heart (skrrt, skrrt)
These niggas, they some marks (skrrt, skrrt)
Nigga, fuck the plug (skrrt, skrrt)
I made myself a plug (skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus]
Fuck it up in the trap, yeah, yeah
I just DOA'd a thot, yeah, yeah
Couple Dracos in the spot, yeah, yeah
All my niggas scammalot, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Push, start, roll up, man I'm on my own
Come through with my doors up, man I'm in my zone
Little brothers froze up, and I'm comin' strong
All my baby mammas keep at least a Rollie on
When I'm on a pill, that mean that I'm a rollin' stone, yeah
When I had the crack, that mean that I was rollin' stones, yeah
When I got that gat, that mean I get my roll on, yeah
When I give her a stack I'm already knowin' she comin' home
You need to get your buzz up, yeah, yeah
I fuck like three strippers at one time, yeah, yeah
I'm rollin' three dices at one time, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna wife you for one time
You ain't got no license, duckin' one time
I know you been triflin' for one time
Shit, if I had all the love in the world for you
Yeah, I damn near gave my girl to you, yeah, yeah
Before you take it, give some drugs to you, yeah, yeah
Hit the yatch and roll loud with you, yeah, yeah
Know, I made my nigga proud, yeah, yeah
I can't hang around no coward niggas, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Lil shorty broke my heart (skrrt, skrrt)
These niggas, they some marks (skrrt, skrrt)
Nigga, fuck the plug (skrrt, skrrt)
I made myself a plug (skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus]
Fuck it up in the trap, yeah, yeah
I just DOA'd a thot, yeah, yeah
Couple Dracos in the spot, yeah, yeah
All my niggas scammalot, yeah, yeah
