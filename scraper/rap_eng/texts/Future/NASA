[Intro: Future & Ginuwine]
Esco
Someone who knows how to ride
Super
Lurk all over and through you baby
Yeah
Let's do it, let's do it

[Verse 1: Future & French Montana]
Medusa mink rugs on the plugs with the juice baby
Heating up the pool and it's wintertime, blood, baby
Really big wrist, 20 karat no Fugazi
Sitting courtside bet 100 on LeBron, baby (100 on LeBron baby)
Someone who knows how to ride
I been doin' numbers in the jungle wit' the savages
Imma put in work until that time and leave my legacy
I been makin' moves you can't infiltrate my embassy
Someone who knows how to ride...
Never go against 'em never go against the fam'
It ain't incidental why you do it for the 'gram
You can't see the work I'm puttin' in while I'm prayin'
If you can see the vision you won't never understand
Someone who knows how to ride...
I'm tryna count this money
...Without even falling off
Put you outta commision ain't no time for no credits (ay, ay)
(Ain't no time for no credits)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Hope, when it hit the fan you gon' lie for me
Hope, every time you see me win you gon' smile for me
I buy the whole dealer if you run a mile for me
Crocodile bags never turn your tears crocodile for me (roll-up)
Fuck her when my nerves turn super poles
Now I couldn't dodge the box every time I saw her
She mad I had to leave her for the paper and I know it
Took her to the hill with german shepherd with the foreign car
Shorty gotta man but fuck me like a pornstar (ouu)
Get me in the mood everything to gain nothin' to lose (ay, ay, aye)
Ouu, baby

[Outro: Ginuwine]
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Lurk all over and through you baby
Let's do it, let's do it
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Lurk all over and through you baby
Let's do it, let's do it
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Lurk all over and through you baby
Let's do it, let's do it
