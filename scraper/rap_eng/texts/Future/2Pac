[Hook: Future]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My little brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a tear drop
A bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppas
And when you matchin' head to toe, they say you too fly
Got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2pac

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a bandana 'round my head screaming thug life
I get faded off them Xans and a muddy drink
Got a bandana round my head, like I’m Soulja
Keep that choppa on a nigga, like Magnolia
Put some blonde in my dread, I went to pop
For my brother 16th birthday, bought him a new Glock
These niggas taking off your head for a new watch
My young nigga, he ain’t scared, he want a new body
I done fucked around and cashed out on some new exotics
Bitch ain’t never speak, now englo, I went too tropic
Tie bandana ‘round my head, like I’m Birdie
I left my dope with my grandma, had her servin'

[Hook]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My little brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went to pop
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a tear drop
A bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppas
And when you matchin' head to toe, they say you too fly
Got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2pac

[Verse 2: Future]
These hood bitches loving a nigga, like I'm Alpo
My lil' cousin got that yoppa on him and he broke
Got designer on my collar, like I'm Bon Jovi
I got all these problems, I just bought a bunch of doddi
These niggas killing everybody's bitches, fuck that dirty pussy
These niggas ain't used to no pimping, they gon' pay for pussy
Got that bandana 'round my head like a rebel boy
All this molly in my system, I can see the devil
And I’m playin' round wit' these presidents
Still tote a one-hundred round wit' a felony
Keep a few kilos on me nephew, these links on me, they cuban
Got banana clips on banana clips, on banana clips

[Hook]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My little brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went to pop
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a tear drop
A bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppas
And when you matchin' head to toe, they say you too fly
Got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2pac
