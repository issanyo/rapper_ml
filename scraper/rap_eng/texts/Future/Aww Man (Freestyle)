[Hook: Future]
I done ran sack up, aww man
I just poured the drank up, aww man
I done turnt hoes up, aww man
That ho sittin', screamin' "aww man"
We done seen a lot of shit never had it
Till you get money boy, you know you got it
I ain't show you how to do it, aww man
Got my whole city screamin' "aww man"

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Aww man aww man, I got the world in the palm of my hand
Bomb in my pants, bomb in my bitch, aww man aww man
We go straight to the mall and I make sure that she never argue again
Niggas successes in all of my plans, break down a swisher with all of my grams. They all my of gram, know that i France they all in my fans
Still in the style
Need more security cams
I know who i am, I know were am going, and won't talk to siri again
I came with a plan, I play like a champ and all of my numbers say winning
Nigga no rest
24
Like 7/11 I'm up, pill, kicking back in my sevens is up, money talking i dont think were ? enough
I'm on my seconds lil bro beast
