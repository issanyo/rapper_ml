[Hook]
Me and my niggas came from nothing
And we ran it up together
We drink that lean and Sprite forever
And we gon stay rich together
Cause me and my nigga, we came from nothing
And we gon get this cake forever
Yea we done drank that lean forever
And now we came up together
Yea, yea, yea

[Verse 1]
Patron and lean, Patron and lean
Pay 1.5 mill for the crib with a lake on it
Rock star Astronaut Status niggas still hatin on it
Got bad bad bitches at the house still waitin on me, waitin on me
I toastin up, I hit the international lottery
Makin millions all for reals, my niggas awful proud of me
I be blowin doja, i dont know what it like to be sober
Million dollar niggas, I got million dollar soldiers
And ain’t it everything we can make it this far?
Hood to the core but my swagger’s out the park
My swagger’s out the roof, my swagger’s out to mars
My swag is in another planet

[Hook]
Me and my niggas came from nothing
And we ran it up together
We drink that lean and Sprite forever
And we gon stay rich together
Come here my nigga, we came from nothing
And we gon get this cake forever
Yea we done drank that lean forever
And now we came up together
Yea, yea, yea

[Verse 2]
I got my long Johns on with my timberlands on
Put my sharks on, we finessing a nigga
And he better not come short home
You know how many licks me and scooter done hit home?
You know how many licks me and Sammy done went on?
Made em write the songs for Rihanna
Love songs, they calling me up for Madonna
I’m a Rolling Stone
And who would think it all started from Rolling Stones ay

[Interlude]
I was standin on the corner , with a fix slab
Tryna make a hundred dollas, tryna make a hundred dollas stretch
Nigga run it up, run it up
I was runnin the corner
Late night on the late
But my nigga on the lick
Only thing that matter
Tryna run it up, run it up

[Hook]
Me and my niggas came from nothing
And we ran it up together
We drink that lean and Sprite forever
And we gon stay rich together
Cause me and my nigga, we came from nothing
And we gon get this cake forever
Yea we done drank that lean forever
And now we came up together
Yea, yea, yea

[Outro]
Rich Gang!
