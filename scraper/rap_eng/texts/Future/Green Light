[Intro: Trouble]
Disrespect on the streets
This is what the streets were waiting on
We ain't know baby
I love when they say that they can't hand out the cake
But they ain't really fool me, this nigga already out the gate
We can't handle this disrespect
Wait 'till you see what we're doing with this green light
I'm done trailin' off
Don Cannon
Unstoppable trouble, Trouble
Awwwww man

[Chorus: Future]
I know some niggas who've been snitchin' on the low
I know they didn't seem right
I done splat a couple niggas on the low
For the grind to be a green light
I had to turn my back on a couple hoes
I know they didn't mean right
I'd do anything to get it though
You should know that it's a green light
A green light, a green light

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Is it green light, never mind what it seem like
Not for you though, trouble for anybody against it
You get, I take it that you with me
So for anybody against it, we are what they won't mention
No negativity
If it is, I'll tell you what I'll do specifically
End up in a penitentiary
But I gotta stay free, keep getting the FreeBanz
They wanna be GPTW, keep our feet in the sand
Need you to take the chance, fuck what you heard about it
Here's your green light, what you gonna do about it
Is you gonna go with her, or refuse and turn your back around
Either way Trouble and duck tape on steady ground

[Chorus: Future]
I know some niggas who've been snitchin' on the low
I know they didn't seem right
I done splat a couple niggas on the low
For the grind to be a green light
I had to turn my back on a couple hoes
I know they didn't mean right
I'd do anything to get it though
You should know that it's a green light
A green light, a green light

[Verse 2: Future]
Yeah, I take the six and six and play my position
The sort of position that floods me with Benz's
I go to the level my Guinness cause my fingers are itchy
You haters ain't number the target
You ain't nothin' but a bargain
My niggas out here, who'll be starvin'
They knock you out with their carbon
I'll stay the side to margin
I took my bitches far, give me my style and I'm the hardest
I took my girl to Pluto, I spare you nigga what you don't know
The AP love the who though
I look at time like peso
Walla walla walla, don't want me to pull a shotta
Your mommies call me papa
All my bitches call me dada
Two cups of the lean in the moon and
My trap and lean is boomin'
An often parable for success is nigga keep on movin'

[Chorus: Future]
I know some niggas who've been snitchin' on the low
I know they didn't seem right
I done splat a couple niggas on the low
For the grind to be a green light
I had to turn my back on a couple hoes
I know they didn't mean right
I'd do anything to get it though
You should know that it's a green light
A green light, a green light

[Outro: Trouble]
Niggas all about passin'
I don't know what the fuck a pass is
Either you in or you out
Green light
