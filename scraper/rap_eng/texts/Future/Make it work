Lemme get this one thing straight
I'll be on it haters gonna hate
Fact Is I'm coming up on my game
People don't matter it's what I say

Hell yeah!
And  then I raise my stakes
To bring the better guy down
I get to reign
I Make him pay
I rest my case
Never satisfied
With my ways

Let's get a start to it
Smooth flow
Sitting back eyes closed
I push my life to is where my mind goes
My friends know

I never settle for a thing no less
Everyday i grow impress
I'm Back to my terrace
Writing songs
Watching stars
Sometimes I come out when the night dawns

Something comes up with a push down
On my mind
Just win my nigga just win and I'm on my loosing time
Someday I'll get it right
Make few niggas make few niggas good by the time
They're my bros lows and highs
I wish I had gotten them before time

Egos runnings in the minds
Complacence is a drag
Still got reasons to brag
Hell I need a season to brag and a life to show
It's not about who's says  you're born to be. Or what you're meant to see
Or give a greater thought to a dynasty your  parents see
In  you


When and ever I win with my homies, squads rolling all on the Whole
All these people know
Have to thank for all I got
For all I got was a start to grow
I wipe up the sweat from my head
We all want to rise to rule

Oh lord something even bigger
Or might just give the world no more ladders
Always Pushed down , does it matter
I'm a stone cold stubborn guy hahahah I won't waver
Got some floating around In the  air
Like they've been accomplishing
Every thing
They've got themselves high enough
We gotta stay on the ground
Make it work




I got my weed alive
Its simple time with the people right
I don't know what u want but right now I gotta make this freaking time mine
Got A1 folk's rollin right sight front of mine
People bragging about accomplishments on fire
And I wanna know how's it gonna make it winning cry
Coz I wonder one win wonh't make a life
Know I gotta have my brains working all the time
Persistence and consistency are always worth a dime

Just a simple boy dreaming big
And working hard
But it feels like something's missed and

I got to pick The lessons in my life and make some milLs
I had me dreaming about a girl she gave me chills

I could've lied  I may be fake with my life
Maybe I've been making life
Too bigg a deal to decide
Where I wanna go how I wanna live life
We grind grind
Do anything
We can to make it bright
Handful of bounty on me
Handful of daring energy
I just need to put it somewhere , maybe even bleed

Mission is to make a milli get u mortified
To mix my release with all my mind
Never normal never setlling never giving
Up
I scribble for them folks
Get them rising to the goal
