Cartier diamonds, my mascot
Tell your main nigga he your ex now
Finna push up, bring your ass out
Where you come from? Where you from now?

Dreads on me like Beijing, yeah, yeah
After this, right back to him, like an accident
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Came in a car, you gon' leave in a jet, I can promise you that (Yeah, yeah)
Came by myself, I'ma leave with your friends, I can promise you that (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
Permanent issues got me thinkin' outside the box
They was sayin' I was cocky, I don't feel like I'm cocky enough
Yeah, he fuck you and I fuck you, I don't wanna get caught carin' too much
I can't expect you to change when you did it for fame, yeah
I'm thinkin' tropical, beaches and leeches, I'm thinkin' private, oh
From the car to the jet, from the jet to the beach, got a million-some dollars on me
Got a milli' on me with a Richard Mille on me, I'm the bigger homie
I don't get no sleep, I made love on these corners

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Cartier diamonds, my mascot
Tell your main nigga he your ex now
Finna push up, bring your ass out
Where you come from? Where you from now?
I keep a bad thing on me, yeah, yeah
Dreads on me like Beijing, yeah, yeah
After this, right back to him, like an accident
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Came in a car, you gon' leave in a jet, I can promise you that (Yeah, yeah)
Came by myself, I'ma leave with your friends, I can promise you that (Yeah, yeah)
Came in a car, and you gon' leave in a jet, I can promise you that (Yeah, yeah)
Never met no nigga richer than me, I can promise you that (Hell yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Never met no nigga flyer than me, I can promise you that (Promise you that)
Promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
Never met no nigga talkin' to you when he fuck you like that

[Outro: Future]

I hope we on the same accord (Woo)
Let me fix all my rings
Let's converse off codeine (Yeah)
