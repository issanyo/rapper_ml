[Intro: Joe Moses & Future]
Shoot up your set, the K's out, niggas they shoot, but never kill
Moses, he known for the drug deal, heavy be pushin', that's so fo' real
My niggas raw and they so fo' real, you niggas soft and you hoe fo' real
All of my dawgs, they 'bout it, 'bout it (I'm goin' too brazy)

[Chorus: Future]
Back goin’ brazy (Yey), I whip the Mercedes (Yey yey)
I’m back goin’ brazy (Yey yey), I whip the Mercedes (Skrr Skrr)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy), I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back, I'm back), I’m back goin’ brazy
I’m back on the bullshit, I’m back on that Pucci
I’m back on the Gucci, I’m back and she wet like jacuzzi
I’m back with a three piece, I’m back with the Uzi

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
I’m back with the shooters, we [?] like Cuban
Stop actin' stupid, my niggas they foolish (what?!)
Them niggas know, we shoot and you don't (what?!)
Margiela and Louis, ya hoe is a groupie (what?!)
I put the that B on everything, married to us is a gang gang
Too much diamonds it's chain gang, all of my bitches' throwback
Blacking the track with a codine, all of my bitches' is slouchy

More like a [?] man, Twist, my nigga forever
Smilely and P.T forever, B, he gonna get the cheddar
[?] my nigga he killin', free all my niggas they illin'
NWB in the building, fuck it I'll sign for a million
Fuck it I'll sign for a bird (Prrr), throw it on caption and post it
Ain’t no more fuckin' with Jody, L.A. they know that they know it
L.A. they know that they know it, L.A. they know that they know it

[Chorus: Future]
Back goin’ brazy (Yey), I whip the Mercedes (Yey yey)
I’m back goin’ brazy (Yey yey), I whip the Mercedes (Skrr Skrr)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy), I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back, I'm back), I’m back goin’ brazy
I’m back on the bullshit, I’m back on that Pucci
I’m back on the Gucci, I’m back and she wet like jacuzzi
I’m back with a three piece, I’m back with the Uzi

[Verse 3: Future]
My man kickin' shit like he Bruce Lee
She bad, she on duty, I'm back makin' movies
Kick back and boolin', what's brackin'? 400 clips in the wagon
These racks on me, I got the bracks on me, I got the racks on me, I got the bracks
I got the bracks on bracks, the bales, the bales, they come to get taxed
I got the braps, the braps, the braps, 100 a nigga get wacked
Shout out to OG Wacko, holdin' it down on the West Boast
Smokin' on gas by the pound from the West Boast
I pulled a bitch from the West Boast, I came back with the nitro
She want pink roses, I put diamonds on her toes
I put the B diamonds all on my neck and my wrist and then all on my ring, ring
[?] where them youngings at who gon' make the bottle go ring, ring
Bzzz all on your head like a bee be

[Chorus: Future]
Back goin’ brazy (Yey), I whip the Mercedes (Yey yey)
I’m back goin’ brazy (Yey yey), I whip the Mercedes (Skrr Skrr)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy), I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back goin' brazy)
I’m back goin’ brazy (I'm back, I'm back), I’m back goin’ brazy
I’m back on the bullshit, I’m back on that Pucci
I’m back on the Gucci, I’m back and she wet like jacuzzi
I’m back with a three piece, (back with a three piece, back with a three piece)
