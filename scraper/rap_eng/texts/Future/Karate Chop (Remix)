[Intro]
Taylor Gang
Taylor

[Hook: Future]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in that new Rari
Livin like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Wiz Khalifa]
Bandana on the K, that’s a karate chop
Hit him one time, he’ll lose a body part
Takin shots of gin, smoking till my lungs are dark
I’m a Taylor Gang nigga, I ain’t got a heart
Bought a new car, dawg, I just got a plot
I’m a fuckin rap star, I ain’t got a boss
911 skirtin, see me ridin in the shirtless
It’s curtains, you worthless
You hurtin, for certain
Rollin up a pound of kush, karate choppin trees
Bruce Lee Jet Li, I got the best weed
I was only 14 when I started rappin
Futures down in Mozaic when they started clappin
I’m from… where they…

Yeah
My nigga Future
This beat is so so rich
