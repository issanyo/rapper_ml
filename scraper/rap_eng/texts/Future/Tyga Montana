Tyga Montana
Got a white bitch named Hannah
She gigging off on my grammar
Pop that titty call that shit Janet
I’m on straight Goose and Tropicana
Hoes like I’m Santa
She Jimmy Choos no sandals
Flipping bitches like they all channels
One hand in my handle
Hammertime then I’m dancin
Got real Hawks in Atlanta
Scar your face for that mansion
Tell her bounce, she prancing
What thats polka dots on your panties?
Who's the boss? Tony Danza
Know you lazy niggas can't stand me
We got four doors and more whores
Two doors that’s short dwarf
Ferrari red horse
It act an ass and go Eeyore
"Hee-Haw!" my engine roar
Half a mil when I finish tour
Last Kings I’mma order more
My watch brand you can’t afford
All good do it Biggie gravy play me baby born
I look so asian all my bitches early 80′s
80 swag speed racing through my shades
I see your fakeness
Hoes gone be hoes can’t save a fucking bitch
It’s simultaneous, Albanian, Israeli, Panamanian
Ukrainian giving dome top cranium
Ass shot jeans like she painted them
T-Raw niggas try to favor him
