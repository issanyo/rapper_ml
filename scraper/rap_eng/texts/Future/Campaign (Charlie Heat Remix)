Campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign
Check out my campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went back to the vault
Did some numbers then I went back in and fought
Did some numbers then I went back like the goat
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went and copped a 911
Did some numbers then I went and copped my bitch a necklace
Then some corner shawty told me "Boy stop drivin' reckless"
Got my side bitch
She keep textin', I ain't get the message
I stopped fuckin' ratchet hoes, they be too messy
Kickin' bitches out like Barcelona, shoutout Messi
Better Black or Mexi, Texi, bitch she too sexy
Double latex when we sexin', shit be too risky
I got a lot, I don't act, I musta flied with the pack
Fuck on my bitch from the back, yeah she like that
I'ma let you, tell her we never gon' lose
Momma, I'll never going broke
My white girl in love with the coke

[Chorus: Future]
I brought them bottles on bottles
I fuck with models on models
I'll take that molly with molly
I got the racks on racks
Campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign
Check out my campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went back to the vault
Did some numbers then I went back in and fought
Did some numbers then I went back like the goat
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche

[Verse 2: Future]
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche
Did some numbers and I had to keep the torch
Did some numbers, always gotta do the tour
I just seen you flexin', turned up on a check
You gon' make a nigga fuck up some more racks
I got a light on the DA, I was just fuckin' the secretary

Nigga, you know that shit necessary
Nigga, you know that shit necessary

[Chorus: Future]
I brought them bottles on bottles
I fuck with models on models
I'll take that molly with molly

Campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign
Check out my campaign, campaign, campaign, campaign

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went back to the vault
Did some numbers then I went back in and fought
Did some numbers then I went back like the goat
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche
