[Intro: Future]
Zoey Dollaz
Freebandz Gang
Forever Or Never
Forever Or Never
Forever Or Never, nigga

[Hook: Future]
Gang, gang, gang
Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat
If you ever turn on me, gotta shoot you in your back, back, back
I'm a chef, I don't cook food, I can cook crack, crack, crack
Fuck the ref, ain't no rules, we gon' get a tech 'bout that
I ain't never running out of juice, gotta keep the Act, Act, Act
Got the bezels on, keep the metal on, gotta lay a nigga flat
Got the ice on, on both arms, got a whole army
Got my water on, and the navy seal, gotta hold down the set

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Cross me, that'll be the last time you ever cross
I'm a Freebandz soldier, never go against the family, we never lost
You better off trying out for suicide, blowing your own melon off
Keepin' all this ice on just to make all my haters hot
They told me I would never make it, now when they book me I feel inspired
These niggas be hatin', they ain't listen to me when I told 'em watch
I just go up on the gram on 'em, every post have niggas shocked
Last year man I hustled off, this year I'm showin' out
Went and copped me a few hammers
Hit the lot, pulled the foreign out
Don't make me pull up on your bitch nigga
She been wanna fuck a rich nigga
And I'm always out with my gang gang
Nigga pull up with the wrong shit then it's click clack bang bang bang

[Hook: Future]
Gang, gang, gang
Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat
If you ever turn on me, gotta shoot you in your back, back, back
I'm a chef, I don't cook food, I can cook crack, crack, crack
Fuck the ref, ain't no rules, we gon' get a tech 'bout that
I ain't never running out of juice, gotta keep the Act, Act, Act
Got the bezel on, keep the metal on, gotta lay a nigga flat
Got the ice on, on both arms, got a whole army
Got my water on, and the navy seal, gotta hold down the set

[Verse 2: Future]
Gotta pipe down, when the war down, G5's I'm lit
Got the cellphones in the jail cell, young nigga sendin' hits
Gotta watch on, put a price on, that's a whole lot of bricks
Bring the whole Zone 6 with nigga, that's a whole lot of sticks
If they look at you like a lick guarantee you can get bit
With the cars downs that the clique pay every day you don't switch
Forever Or Never nigga, Forever Or Never about the shit
(What you represent?) FBG
