[Intro: Future]
Future Hendrix
Yeah
It ain't a secret
Straight up

[Verse 1: Future]
I'm the one who got the presi' flooded
You wear more Chanel than anybody?
You the type to get ya man indicted
I'm the type to pull up in a Spider
I'm the type to drive a Hummer
Put a hunna round clip inside a dirty rifle
It's dirty when it got a homi on it
Fuck that nigga put a bounty on em
I'm the one that put that dirty in the cup
Had you sippin', noddin' off nigga
You was gettin' fronted, runnin' off nigga
I made myself to a boss nigga
Put a hundred carats in a cross nigga
Put a 200 thousand on a cross nigga
Could never sleep cause it'll cost niggas
They can never see my palms sweaty
You never seen the hunger in me
I'm so sick and tired of being humbled nigga
This money put a lot of demons in me
Went and tatted all these angels on me
Fuck that nigga put a tracker on em
Then we throw a pep rally on em
These commas coming in
These haters coming in
The karma coming back from when I was gettin' it in
My baby mama tryna sue again
Bought my little twins Christian Louboutins
Get my nigga commissary in the pen
Got the Federales on a nigga chin
Fuck the Benz, I'ma whip the Spur
But fuck my Spur, I bought my bitch a Ghost
I'm full of syrup and I'm seeing ghosts
I'm pushing heroin right through N.O

[Break]
You know we got that boy-boy like New Orleans, ya hear me? Runnin that pack through Chi Town, Memphis, All up through B More & DC

[Bridge]
Lil' Mexico turf a gang land
I'm ABK like I'm Zonaman
That's Any Body Killa nigga
Do you have the heart to kill a nigga?
100 thousand for a lawyer, gotta be a Johnnie Cochran
Take the dope off the border, from the water, put it in the water

[Verse 2]
Know some Mexicanos down in Georgia (my migos)
We on every channel when we pop it
Hit em in the head and start braggin' bout it
They on 7th street, they gotta bunch of bodies
Gotta bunch of chains, my neck is very crowded
When I flood the street,  they have a powder shower
Know the recipe, you need to learn about it
Finessin' niggas, gotta learn about it
I could cook it in the microwave
I got ya baby momma with the shits
I got your son sitting on a brick
My teacher said I wouldn't be shit
She even know what I represent
Free Band Gang President
Money over everything, nigga
Everything else irrelevant

[Bridge]
Lil' Mexico turf a gang land
I'm ABK like I'm Zonaman
That's Any Body Killa nigga
Do you have the heart to kill a nigga?
100 thousand for a lawyer, gotta be a Johnnie Cochran
Take the dope off the border, from the water, put it in the water
