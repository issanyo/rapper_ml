Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it (Freeband)
From city to city
To city to city, to city
They wet it, they wet it, they wet it
They let me bust on their titties

I try to forget it
I'm callin' the shots, nigga

You better not giver her no money cause all she do is bringin' it to dad (Jeffery)
