My nigga, Zoey my brother
We on Pluto we gon' always stay up here nigga

I bought a stupid AP
The car cost 200 to lease
The car go 200 at least
I'm ready go dumb in the wraith
I'm ready go dumb with the K
These little niggas in the bando
Servin' fish scale at the bando
Came through the block with the roof open
Split a nigga block with the roof open
Slidin' on ya block with the roof open
