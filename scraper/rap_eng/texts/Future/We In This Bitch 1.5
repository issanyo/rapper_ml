Astronaut talk

[Verse 1: Drake]
Okay, you know you been on my mind, A-Town, I miss you
When ol' girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that, the next day, you know that
Daydream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub 'til it's daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Awww, yeah, shout out to the women playing y'all position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you don't judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine, I didn't condone it
But I'm back in this bitch, re-living the moment
I'm about to have it poppin off again
Drama bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got....

[Hook: Future]
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limpin around this bitch, what the fuck you trippin on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch, yeah
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it

[Verse 2: Future]
Water water all around me, damn my diamonds are shinin
Money rainin on you bitches, Future changin the climate
All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cons
Turn up, turn up, turn up it's like a burnt a bunch of Suns
Hah, from Milwaukee to Atlanta
They put my lifestyle on camera, they tripping, no cockin hammers
Addicted to making movies, I like em when they bougie
Anytime I step out, when I come through, it's a zoovie
Ain't rapping to ya, I'm really trapping with words
And I ain't braggin' to ya when I say I'm fly as a bird
That girl don't speak no Englo but she know all my lingo
She know a Rarri when she see one and she know a c-note
I got a Haitian girl speak Creole and a spanish girl from Rio
We could put them in a room together make a perfect combo
They bout that life, I'm bout that life, yes we is, yes we is
The money, bitches and cars come with the life that I live
It should've been a designer party, all these designer round me
Pick a name, anything, money can buy what? Diamond chain
Diamond ring, Murcielagos, Balenciagas
We toasted up to the life, niggas it's ours

[Hook: Future]
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch, yeah
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it
