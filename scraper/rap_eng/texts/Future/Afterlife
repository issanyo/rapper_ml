[Intro]
I'm poppin' my shit every morning (Poppin' my shit)
Then I go to paradise
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
Cough syrup got me dozin' off, I can see you in my afterlife
He snapped the clip in then drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' in the couch, I'm mummified
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I think out loud, I'ma get my money and I don't get tired

[Verse 1]
Sit in the back of the Phantom and have a good night
And have to take nothing off, lit up like a light
I can't see nothin' in the way, was going outta sight
I get her lace on daily basis, she my type
I pop my shit and live lavish, never switch sides
You can go to college, get a crib off the clothes I buy
We in the top of the fuckin' Hills off a Sunset Drive
I'm a product of the field, I'm just in my disguise
Hit the trippin' off a pill but don't give me some cake
I've been jumpin' on these Lears, that's the way I'ma chase 'em
Franklins comin' by the layers, that's the way we gon' make 'em
She don't know when I'ma pop 'em so she gotta sleep naked
I can tell the way they treat me, they gon' say I'm the greatest
Ain't no tellin' if I leave you, I'ma ever come back (Pluto)
Ain't gon' never let a disloyal bitch hold me back (No)
I done Goyard my bags so we could hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq (Yeah)
You can't help who you love nigga (Can't help who you love)
That's why God made thug niggas (Yeah, straight up)

[Chorus]
Cough syrup got me dozin' off, I can see you in my afterlife
He snapped the clip in then drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' in the couch, I'm mummified
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I think out loud, I'ma get my money and I don't get tired

[Verse 2]
I think out loud, I'ma get my checks, fuck you niggas
I need to get it off my chest, fuck you niggas
I got my hittas in the cut, I'm still that nigga
I got her flattin' out her tummy, I'm that nigga (Super)
Takin' my time, my new bank account gettin' taller
I flood out Richard, that gon' cost me at least a quarter (Least a quarter)
I done been in my bag lately and I been poppin my collar (My bag)
I got a good taste in bitches 'cause they swallow (Yeah)
I done birthed a lotta lil' niggas, I'm their father (Future)
Can't be responsible, how you move? 'Cause I taught ya (I can)
Keep it a thousand, ok bool
That's how I was brought up (One thousand)
Lil' nigga had to pay his dues, man, slaughter (free Lu)
9 bracelets on me, baby, hold on, wait (Hold on)
9 rings on me, baby, hold on, wait (I'm the champ)
Got that Glizzy on me, baby, hold on wait (That's a Glock)
Don't be shy with that pussy, hold on, wait (Yeah, mine)
90 vibes at the crib, pick a race (Yes)
I would've said at least one hundred to play it safe (Robbin' the safe)
When it comes to loud, I'ma roll with Grade A (Grade A)
I don't go outta town unless I'm fillin' up the safe
I done crocodile my Pradas, just to hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq
You can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas

[Outro]
You can't help who you love, nigga
I'm poppin' my shit every mornin'
Then I go to paradise
Can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas
