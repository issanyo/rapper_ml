Rack rack city bitch....
Get get smacked silly bitch
I'mma give ya'll 50 bars on this one.....Ready?

So what they tryna hate for
They know I'm gettin' paid more
And when I'm in the club, everything I drink is paid for?
You left the picture and missed everything u stayed for
The game gettin' tough but this the shit that I was made for
So act up, best believe you gettin' smacked up
Pedal to metal I ain't lettin' niggas catch up
And we could match up homie we gonn smoke too
Cause it's our time and we gonn shine like we supposed to
I told you, I'm the illest with this mic shit
Spit it off the top, I'ont even gotta write shit
My tight shit sounds the best when I be dumb high
Cause I get Harvard brain and I'm far from an alumni
You dumb guys, I do rap and soccer shit
You don't see me glow? I'm bout to blow like a rocket ship
U talkin' shit I think its best that u dip and hide
Cause when I start to flow it be wet like a slip n slide
I'm gettin high u can tell my eyes is bloodshot
Take a lotta pictures but I stay away from mugshots
I do my thing boy I always do my shit well
Rest in peace to em but I'm bout to smoke a Big L
Brain twisted, soul being lifted
You should hand over the mic like Taylor Swift did
See what the piff did, feel like I'mma die slow
Hit it and a nigga spit fire like I'm Spy-ro
My eyes low, compliments cause I rhyme well
I'm runnin' in your crib like I'm Kramer off of Seinfeld
You sleepin' boo? I slide thru, like PeekaBoo
You frozen in shock now ya nickname is Pikachu
Jeez - I swear I'll try and take it easy
A nigga need a wife but need some bitches who are sleazy
For when I'm feelin' low, they know exactly how to please me
To all my niggas listenin' I know ya fuckin' sees me
Yeaa
Cause I got bitches on the side
That'll hop on the dick, if I feel like gettin' sidetracked
They ride that til I nut and then I pass out
Then I give em food and and cab and kick they ass out...
That's how a player do
And I'mma player who
Loves gettin' brain so shout outs to all my players too
And they say hate the game not the player boo
But bitches doin' circles like muhfuckin dreidel do
And I'll shake up the whole damn place
My punchlines'll punch lines in ya whole damn face
I smoke weed and sip goose til I start to get loose
Fake niggas gimme dap, I leave em hanging no noose, damn
You can't battle? well I'll kill him myself
A registered sex offender how I'm feelin' myself
You feelin' the wealth, well I got paper in sight
A lotta niggas can't stand how I'm rapin the mic
But all this herb got me lookin' like a china man
Everybody know I rap so I rhyme when I can
Try and name somebody with as many lines as ya man
Time is money guess I gotta lot of time on my hands
And I got paper in my pockets I'm just achin' to burn
N you could shine when its ya time but keep waitin' ya turn
Cause its mine n I'mma grind til this paper I earn
And ion preach but ill teach til they blatantly learn
Understand I'mma boss, I could never take an off day
Cause I'mma be a star who got bucks, no latte s
Papi what the ladies love to call me
Cause they love when I get it up like wall street
I'm good lookin', rhyme tight, and I flow nuts
Krispy Kreme workers even sayin' that my dough nuts
I go nuts boy....
