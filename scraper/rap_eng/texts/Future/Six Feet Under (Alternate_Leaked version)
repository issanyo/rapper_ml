[Verse 1]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Hook]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

[Hook]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now

[Verse 2]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Hook]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

[Hook]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now

[Bridge]
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
Till she..

[Outro]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
