[Intro: Future]
Zaytoven
Lil Mexico all the way
Yeah, hahaha, woah, yeah

[Chorus: Future & Maceo]
You can't be sabotaging my persona
We way richer than Al Capone is
You can check every stone that's on me
You can push your coke through the city
Every day, hey, hey, hey, hey if you want it
I know they hatin' hey, hey, hey, hey send our condolence
I run the game so my hood is noticed
I put my gang on the map (Ya did), we drove it
I'm just tryna keep the circle more closer
I'm just tryna keep the Actavis, woah, woah
I just wanna see your passion, come for it
Lil Mexico shit
I'm livin' out what I dreamed as a boy
Unlimited kush, come and dream witcha boy
Freebandz gang, Taliban gang, all that yeah
I'm tryna make sure my niggas employed
Ya did

[Verse 1: Maceo]
These niggas they really wanted just to get it
Grinded hard and came out of them trenches
Back in '94 when Juicy was with me
Free Mario, but you know we don't get it (Free Mario)
Worry 'bout finessin', you know we gon' get it (worry 'bout finessin')
When Future dropped they thought it was a gimmick (hey, hey)
Now look at Freebandz we runnin' the industry (we run it)
Middle finger, yeah, to all of my enemies (Fuck you)
Baptized in the codeine, but we spend the night with the dope fiends (hey, hey, hey)
Havin' flashbacks to me on the block, remember runnin' from the police (get outta there)
Never turn my back on the gang (never), niggas'll die by the chain
We want the fortune fuck fame (yeah), new school [?] two lanes (skrt)
Still movin' packs of the 'caine, no Kool-aid in my vein (uh-uh)
They ain't sabotagin' my name (no you can't), [?] your bales on rain
Why I put on for Lil Mexico (woah), boy I swear I am the next to blow (I am)
Remember trappin' at the Stop-n-Go, now I'm with Drake and Future on the road

[Chorus: Future & Maceo]
You can't be sabotaging my persona
We way richer than Al Capone is
You can check every stone that's on me
You can push your coke through the city
Every day, hey, hey, hey, hey if you want it
I know they hatin' hey, hey, hey, hey send our condolence
I run the game so my hood is noticed
I put my gang on the map, (Ya did) we drove it
I'm just tryna keep the circle more closer
I'm just tryna keep the Actavis, woah
I just wanna see your passion, come for it
I'm livin' out what I dreamed as a boy
Unlimited kush, come and dream witcha boy
I'm tryna make sure my niggas employed

[Verse 2: Future]
Tryna make sure they don't feel avoided
I can't get caught up I'm checkin' this poison
I gotta make sure my bitches stay gorgeous
I gotta be vicious and come to my vision
Be more specific you makin' decisions
I got all these riches and I re-conditioned
You know the dawgs been convicted
You know we still dodgin' prison
You see the way we was livin'
You see how good we livin'
[?] too far at the same time, hold on, hold on
Money pickin' up on both phones, hold on, hold on
I'm 'bout to get back to what I was doin', hold on
You look suspicious, fugazi, hold on, hold on
Poppin' tags on the regular, hold on, hold on
[?] real my uncle [?], hold on, hold on
Messiah is nothin' to [?] me, hold on, hold on
I can just end your career today, so long, so long

[Chorus: Future & Maceo]
You can't be sabotaging my persona
We way richer than Al Capone is
You can check every stone that's on me
You can push your coke through the city
Every day, hey, hey, hey, hey if you want it
I know they hatin' hey, hey, hey, hey send our condolence
I run the game so my hood is noticed
I put my gang on the map, (Ya did) we drove it
I'm just tryna keep the circle more closer
I'm just tryna keep the Actavis, woah
I just wanna see your passion, come for it
I'm livin' out what I dreamed as a boy
Unlimited kush, come and dream witcha boy
I'm tryna make sure my niggas employed

[Outro: Future]
You can't be sabotaging my persona
We way richer than Al Capone is
You can check every stone that's on me
You can push your coke through the city
Every day, hey, hey, hey, hey if you want it
I know they hatin' hey, hey, hey, hey send our condolence
