[Intro: Future]
Nard N B
Two different things
We in love with two different things
It's true, got a lot of differences
(Damn DJ Plug you just killed it)

[Chorus: Future]
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that truck
I'm in love with my gram, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I ain't the one to be crabby
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm in love with her butt, she fell in love with that truck
I'm in love with her frame, she fell in love with the guts
Red seats on the inside, dark tints where my dimes slide
Sometimes we just switch rides
She my chick forever, no switch sides

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
You get my chick nigga, no not at all
Situations get messy, she not involved
Hit the mall, she got cash, fucking cards
My chick, she gon' swipe it off
My chick, she gon' swipe it off

[Bridge: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm in love with her butt, she fell in love with that truck
I'm in love with her frame, she fell in love with the guts
She fell in love with the guts
Red seats on the inside, dark tints where my dimes slide
Sometimes we just switch rides
She my chick forever, no switch sides

[Chorus: Future]
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that truck
I'm in love with my gram, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I ain't the one to be crabby
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
She wanted that Benz, I copped it
She wanted that bag, I copped it
Ain't the one to be petty
You want it? I'ma gon' let you have it
It ain't tricking, I got it
My dime flier than pilots
See her up in that wagon
Loud pipe sound like a dragon
She walk in the place, they gon' pay her attention
Ain't worried about no one that be sneak dissing
My chick can get it all if she want it
I give it without a cause
We be balling like it's love from (?)
She like (?) and I'm like (?)

[Bridge: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm in love with her butt, she fell in love with that truck
I'm in love with her frame, she fell in love with the guts
She fell in love with the guts
Red seats on the inside, dark tints where my dimes slide
Sometimes we just switch rides
She my chick forever, no switch sides

[Chorus: Future]
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that truck
I'm in love with my gram, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I'ma gonna let you have it
I ain't tryna be petty, I ain't the one to be crabby
I'm in love with this cup, she in love with that wagon
I'm in love with this cash, she in love with that mansion
