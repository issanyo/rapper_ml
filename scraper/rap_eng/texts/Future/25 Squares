[Intro: Future]
Don't let this lean hold you back from your full potential
She said your'e the smartest person I've ever bumped into
Super

[Hook: Future]
I got these checks on my mind, it's on my mental
I got two Bentley different kinds, they look identical
I put in a certain amount of time, now I'm a general
I can vividly see the day I was going in 'em
I'm talking 25 squares and a rental
You got a million on you, I might kill ya
I can't go back to finessin', it's detrimental
They showed me the billion dollar recipe and I remember

[Verse 1: Big Bank Black]
Came up, fucked up, living like a savage
Watch my pops give up turn to a addict
OG's in front the store frontin' niggas package
White powder turn to blow, I thought I seen magic
Bought a 50 dollar slap, now it's Big Bank Escobar
These hoes really up for grab when you having some
They thought I wouldn't succeed but I veni, vidi, vici
Only time a nigga love you, when he begging or he need you
Made myself a boss, a billion dollar mind
Zone 6, living lavish big bank a rare kind
Duct Tape, that's the mob that's my whole spine
My nigga Pluto, Freebandz but we the same kind

[Hook: Future]
I got these checks on my mind, it's on my mental
I got two Bentley different kinds, they look identical
I put in a certain amount of time, now I'm a general
I can vividly see the day I was going in 'em
I'm talking 25 squares and a rental
You got a million on you, I might kill ya
I can't go back to finessin', its detrimental
They showed me the billion dollar recipe and I remember

[Verse 2: Future]
I poured a little baking soda and more xan's
You bett' not let them hollowtips touch your hands
You see I came up and I blew out like a fan
I watch my man's turn his back when I expanded
Flipping that raw raw it came in a casket
We on the Southside lil woadie 'bout to blast it
And I knew, I knew when I was on that corner I wasn't average
Sometime I like to post up
Take the styrofoam and toast up
You know damn well these niggas below us
I made the right moves just listening to my instincts
I got my Pirus, my Grave street niggas with me

[Hook: Future]
I got these checks on my mind, it's on my mental

You got a million on you, I might kill ya
I can't go back to finessin' it's detrimental
