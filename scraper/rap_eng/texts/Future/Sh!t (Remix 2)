[Intro: Diddy]
(Ayo, classic shit)
Ain't nothin' worse in life than a fuck nigga
(Ayo, close the door, turn out the lights, man)
Even worse is a fuck bitch
We should banish all them niggas, for real
Ayo, I wanna dedicate this to ya momma, nigga
Ayo, check this out, take that

[Bridge: Diddy & (Future) - Repeated throughout song]
Da-dee-da-da-da, da-dee-da-da-da, da-dee-da-da-da
Ya ya ya ya ya (ya ya ya ya ya)

[Hook: Future]
Talkin' bout ya poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' bout 100 bottles, nigga, you ain't pop shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spendin' money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Shit, shit

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I ain't tryna hear a whole bunch of that (shit)
About how many bodies you caught (shit)
My niggas is real thug niggas, them real niggas don't talk
Worldstar niggas get caught, wavin' all them guns at the cameras
Grown ass nigga, you ain't bout to shoot (shit), you don't do (shit)
You just think it's cool (shit) to move bricks
Real niggas do it cause they got to
I know them real niggas and it's not you
And if they see yo' ass round here frontin'
Real shooter be somewhere and shot you
Man, get the fuck out the booth poppin' that (shit)
Corny ass nigga just talkin' that (shit)
Heard about it, read about it, never been around it
But you think ya soft ass give somebody that (shit)
How you movin' round with ya ho?
You ain't even stickin' to the code
You don't even represent the life right
Pussy nigga sleepin' with a night light
Comin' for ya head like Fight Night
I can get anything done for the right price, boy!
(Bad Boy) Take that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Frontin' like you really on that bullshit
Gun him down, make a motherfucker do a full flip, chip chip
Nigga really really on that Crip shit
Bisquick whip, whip, whip, nigga, move it!
Got the toolie, yeah, the piece, I'mma use it
Nigga ruthless, leave a chump nigga toothless
Tell him "smooches", got that white girl
Get a tan when I ice her, Arm and Hammer
Mixin' venom like a viper, you the buyer
I'm the nigga with the fire, you's a minor
Now I'm major with the paper, coppin' acres
Overseas like a sailor, you a hater
And ya daddy in the same boat, you a busta when ya chain go
Pourin' syrup on my Eggo, four liters for the eight though
To the face, now the day slow, you's a fruity lil' rainbow
Real nigga, call me Django, 50 seconds till the say low
Wild bucks shootin' halos, every pocket got a bank roll
I don't think you really understand me (stand me)
Groovy Q ain't keep the nose candy (candy)

[Interlude: Diddy]
Yeah, man
Y'all niggas thought I was dead?
Boo, nigga, boo! Boo!
I'm here, motherfucker
Yeah, take that, tell ya bitch to duck, pow!

[Verse 3: Future]
Buy the ho 100 pair of red bottoms
That's a quarter milli on a hand job, my nigga
Brrrrr! Stick'em
Fuck you and every nigga came with ya
Go and put a nigga on a picture
Go and put a nigga on a T-shirt
Back in the day when a nigga sell dope
I'mma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, whooo! Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, gettin' higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
Know you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Bundles fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit him in the head, can you keep a solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut, don't blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at, nigga, throw it up

[Hook]
