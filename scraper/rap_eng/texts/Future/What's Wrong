[INTRO]
I Can't answer questions for these fake ass niggas
I'm not about to tweet all you fake motherfuckers
Comment on instagram you bitches

[Hook]
What the fuck wrong with these niggas
You love these hoes more than you love money
These niggas mad dat I'm stuntin'
What the fuck wrong with these niggas
I went to space and they felt left
I Guess you broke and you need help
What the fuck wrong with these niggas
We turning up and they turning down
We smoking kush and by the pound
What the fuck wrong with these niggas
Yeen smashing models like us
Ain't popping bottles like us
Ain't getting money like us
What the fuck wrong with these niggas

[VERSE 1]
I'm outta I Told you in was in pluto
My wallet chain by prada and my pockets on a sumo
Let me find out you cuffin hoes, we trippin off one blunt
My dawg I bought a bunch of smoke
The ferarri suicidal I done blowed out the brain
She exotic she got a body put her on a plane
You can have her man I dont want her she just came from spain
I just made a movie and took a green card back again
I Just went back to the dealership bought another benz
I had to order that 65 beore it come in
I'm new millenium, maserati trucks of course
We came from nothing, we grinded up and jumped off the porch

[Hook]
What the fuck wrong with these niggas
You love these hoes more than you love money
These niggas mad dat I'm stuntin'

I went to space and they felt left
I Guess you broke and you need help
What the fuck wrong with these niggas

We smoking kush and by the pound

[VERSE 2]
My Shoes (What Dem Is) They Made By YSL
My Lil Boo (Aye What She In) She Stay In That Chanel
Whats wrong with you, I'm getting money can't you tell
They so confused, Cuz I Ain't need no auto-tune
My team in here turnt up to the maximum we're cooling
If you wanna get dem mushing my shit good then we can do it
Five thousand on a outfit let me show you how I do it
I got bandz coming in dawg, faster than suzuki
Rockstar status dis da way I chunk my dueces
I couldn't stop her if I wanted to, dat girl she bad and choosing
They get mad when you take it and they hate you when you make it
Patiently waiting, dat money coming like it ain't got no patience
