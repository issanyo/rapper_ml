[Hook: Future]
Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
Made a film with them bitches, ain’t no one-on-one
Got this watch, and this watch like a one of one
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a few houses and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one

[Verse 1: Future]
Rich nigga since birth, Louis V chinchilla
Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a 4 wheeler
Solid gold: AP, flooded out with them crystals
Shinning just like molly, I woke up in a new bugatti
Free lil Kirk Wood, Young Gotti, free my nigga White Boy too
I whipped up a two and a baby and I spent that on Jimmy Choo
You got goons around you nigga, I keep shooters around me fool
Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can’t lose

All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one

Bought a few houses and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one

[Verse 2: Future]
Paid dues with that work
Selling dope for some Air Max
Send a bag through the mail
When it come through we call that air tax
Molly world got her overdosin'
La familia they know I'm chosen
Turnt up and yeen know it
Ain't never had shit, what yeen know it?
You got body bags on body bags round here
I got foreign cars on foreign cars and I 'on't ride on rims
Made ten Top 10 records in ten months, I ain't even finished
I know you'd rather see me losin' dog
And you hate to see me winnin'
I'm a millionaire, you can't doubt it
Rich Gang, I'm 'bout it
Bossed up my status
I know you want my spot
"If it sound just like Future, then maybe I can get hot"
I'm the flyest nigga on earth, and my money always come first
(Aye)
