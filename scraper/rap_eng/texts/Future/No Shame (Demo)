[Intro: Future]
Ain't no shame in my game
I found a new high, yeah

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame in my pain)
I found new propane (I found a new propane)
I found new cocaine

[Verse 1: Future]
I found Xanax and it's makin' me fall in love (love)
I found codeine and it's flowin' through my blood
Ain't no shame, there ain't no shame (ain't no shame)
Ain't no shame, there ain't no shame (ain't no)
In codeine, pour, baby, baby, ba, ba
10 bracelets on me lookin' like sunblock
White diamonds drippin' on me, neck Lady Gaga
Cut off any typical broads gave me side eye
Perky runnin' out of time (runnin' out of time)
That Perky fill it up one time
Surfing, wavin' 'round the bags
Dirty cup romance

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame)
There's no shame in my pain (in my pain)
I found new propane (I found)
I found new cocaine (I found it)
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame in my pain)
I found new propane (I found a new propane)
I found new cocaine

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Tomorrow's a new life
Tomorrow's a new life

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
Spent my T's in a [?] (spent my T's)
[?] but I can't, can't promise how I leave (how I leave)
Ah, guess we will see (guess we will see)
The American dream (the American dream)
How it works for me (how it works for me)
I'ma lick my finger and then put it in the candy (candy, yeah)
Now I'm in the desert and I'm dancing (dancing, oh, yeah)
How your dogs stop caring 'bout people (dogs stop caring)
I got dogs start smoking my reef (dogs start smokin', oh)
[?] deep
[?], yeah

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
There's no shame in my game (in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame)
I found new propane (I found)
I found new cocaine (I found it)
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame in my pain)
I found new propane (I found a new propane)
I found new cocaine

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Future]
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Tomorrow's a new life
Tomorrow's a new life

[Outro: Future]
Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no
