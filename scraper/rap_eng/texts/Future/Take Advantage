[Hook: Future]
This is the feeling of a lifetime
That I won't never get back
Aye this the feeling of a lifetime
You can't ever get back
So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over me

[Verse 1: Future]
Since we huggin' we might as well gon' kiss
Since we talkin' we might as well reminisce
Since we kissin' we might as well gon' fuck
Since I'm fuckin' you, might as well gon' and eat it
Since I bought a Rollie I might as well flood it
Since we spendin' some times you might as well suck it
I can't hold your hand now, I'm countin' money
I get money just to stand around, it's hard, trust me
Different bitches in different cities, but it's cool
I'ma keep it pimpin' with you and blow some doja
We gon' eat prime on 12 down on Ocean
Ocean Drive in Miami, that's the way we flexin'
Come with me and stay the night and you won't regret it
Dinner dates, what I do for you is all brand new to me
I'm goin' to court, my baby mama tryin' suin' me
And I'm tryna take it off my mind, with you

[Hook: Future]
This is the feeling of a lifetime
That I won't never get back
Aye this the feeling of a lifetime
You can't ever get back
So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Every time we step out, she keeps me on baller alert
Gotta have tickets just to see these young ballers at work
All I got is my word and rosaries under my shirt
Give you my last, it's not a question, I know what you're worth
Blew me kisses through the window in fed, county jail
Three kidnapping charges, DA denied me my bail
Two million in cash, the property totaled for six
No bonds were needed, I got papis, they're holdin' my chips
These labels be fake, Atlantic a lake
Want you well and run dry, but these levees'll break
But I'm goin' for broke, so far from me sellin' my soul
Decoratin' my home with statues of gold

[Hook: Future]
This is the feeling of a lifetime
That I won't never get back
Aye this the feeling of a lifetime
You can't ever get back
So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over me
