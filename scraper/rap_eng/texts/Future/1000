[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Ah, ah
(Hey, hey, hey!) Assembling a riot
(Hey, hey, hey!) Chanting and circling the fires
(Hey, hey, hey!) Heard behavior, can’t keep it quiet
(Hey, hey, hey!) Kinetic energy a thousand times higher

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Holy shit, it’s working, we all got in
Holy shit, it’s working, now look at my friends
Holy shit, it’s working, it’s bitter to the taste
Holy shit, it’s working, we dancin' in place
What goes up must come down
What goes in must come out
You surrounded, dawg, come on, look around
Hey, hey, I was in, but no, not now
Holy shit, it’s working, no more trail of tears
Holy shit, it’s working, the prophecy is here
Holy shit, it’s working, we’re wreckin' this bih
Holy shit, it’s working, one thousand percent

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
In the mirror, there’s a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Hey, hey, hey! One thousand
Git one thousand
Hunnid, one thousand
Uh, one thousand

[Verse 2: Future]
My girl don’t wear shoes unless they cost over a thousand
Brand new coupe cost couple hundred thousand
Got some models in the bed and they comin' by the thousand
Them young goons never sleep, they somewhere prowlin'
Everywhere we go they tote a chopper by the thousand
Rick Owens boots, I’m walkin' on a few thousand (ay)
Champagne in the club costs thousands
We got gold by the bar, that’s thousands
Ferragamo belt will hit me for a even thousand
We can gamble right now, bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Count the money up in all hundreds, all thousands
I’m too rich to talk if ye ain't talking thousands

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
In the mirror, there’s a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Interlude: Pharrell Williams]
Ah, ah
(Hey, hey, hey!) Assembling a riot
(Hey, hey, hey!) Chanting and circling the fires
(Hey, hey, hey!) Heard behavior, can’t keep it quiet
(Hey, hey, hey!) Kinetic energy a thousand times higher

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Holy shit, it’s working (I’m feeling like a saint)
Holy shit, it’s working (my feel sorry, can’t)
Holy shit, it’s working (we painted our face)
Holy shit, it’s working, the rainbow angst

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
In the mirror, there’s a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Bridge: Shay Haley]
Act like you don’t really hear a lot
You can pretend when you are
Karma makes sure tears will drop
You’ll be wishing that your year will stop
It'll be a thousandfold, one, zero, zero, zero, dot
Act like you don’t really hear a lot
You can pretend when you are
Karma makes sure tears will drop
You’ll be wishing that your year will stop
It will be a thousandfold, one, zero, zero, zero, dot

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
In the mirror, there’s a hero
One, zero, zero, zero

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Hey, hey, hey! One thousand
Git one thousand
Hunnid, one thousand
Uh, one thousand
