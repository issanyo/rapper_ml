[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Ready in the mornin', I seen what you doin'
Need to toot that thing up and say, you know what we doin'
Girl, you too much, sexy as a mother
Love it when you put that knife to my neck and dare me to fuck another
You know you my angel, spread your wings and open up
Never will I disrespect or let a bitch fly above
Now there might be a few on the side, but you know you the one
I'm gon' have you blowin' in the house like a bomb
Give me what I want, I'll get you what you like
I got that what you, what's that gon' feel like?
Have you ever been on Pluto? Well I'm 'bout to make you fly
Once you move them Vicky's to the left, I'm 'bout to get up inside
Like get it baby, bikinis around, well bring them in
We can shoot a feature with you, directin' your friends
Careful with that, gotta take your time
Look at me while you do that, so I can blow your mind

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Girl, you know it ain't no layin' down
Get on all four's, lay on my floor
Gotta do that mouth to mouth
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone

[Verse 2: Future]
Check this, it started off a one night with the freakin' on the weekend
Ever since we hooked up, we been makin' movies from the bigley
Got my mojo and my ego on a Peruvian kilo
With a face like that, I can't even see myself tellin' you NO
You can have my full attention, I'ma fuck with you to the fullest
You got my heart racin' faster than a speedin' bullet
I can't even explain what I'm wanna say to you, you got me fumblin'
That ATL I got it on my back, you know I run it
Ay, come here, you know I'ma let you run it with me
I'ma get the cash and you can spend it with me
I'm livin' in the spotlight, I see stars all in my eyesight
And my life is out of camera, but you got me in the twilight

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Girl, you know it ain't no layin' down
Get on all four's, lay on my floor
Gotta do that mouth to mouth
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
That pussy all mine, least that's what I like to think
Kiss it all the time, know just what I like to drank
Juices from your body, oozin' from your body
When she give me brain, she go stupid, she so sloppy
Man my main so bad, make another bitch bitch mad
My dick got a bag and another dick tag
Livin' it with tats, I'ma bust
I don't give no fucks, nigga that's my ass
She lookin' like some money, yeah you know I'm 'bout to cash out
Put my name on it, like a flier then we pass out
Playin' with the drop, right after I crash out
Wake up and I make her show me what I'm 'bout to fuck out
Nasty motherfucker, I'm a nasty motherfucker, yeah
She my baby, I'm her daddy motherfucker

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Girl, you know it ain't no layin' down
Get on all four's, lay on my floor
Gotta do that mouth to mouth
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
You so sexy, that freaky shit you on
Girl, the way you drop that, we in the twilight zone
