[Intro]
Talk to me
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
You see how we living
I'm tryna keep it as simple as possible
You know what I do

[Verse 1]
Get you Gucci on sight, Rollies on ice
Get first class flights
Ride it like a bike
Get a brand new wag
Be quiet, don't brag
Never pump gas
Nigga keep it on task
Peelin' off, flex
Keep it on track
Fussin' and fightin', fuckin' all night
Gotta make it count
Love it when it bounce
Girl that's tight
Yeah you do whatever you like

[Bridge]
Gucci on sight, Rollie on ice
Take my advice, live a better life

[Chorus]
You got maids right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
Like 4 right now, it’s like 4 right now
Like 4 right now, it's like 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas gon' know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoyed our time, we been on the low for a while
I been solo now, I've been going solo now

[Verse 2]
20 ounce steaks, hey can't fit it on the plate
Jumbo shrimp, hey, straight out of the lake, hey
Sleeping on the boat
Wake up, take dope
You don't want no smoke
Nigga don't want no starch hey
We gon' put it on the hood, ayy
Before we put it on God, hey

[Chorus]
You got maids right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
Like 4 right now, it’s like 4 right now
Like 4 right now, it's like 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas gon' know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoyed our time, we been on the low for a while
I been solo now, I've been going solo now

[Bridge]
Solo now, everybody know right now
I've been going solo now

[Refrain]
Bands on your tags, ain't got bags
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down
Bands on your tags, ain't got bags
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down

[Outro]
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down (no way)
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
Niggas gon' know right now
Everybody know right now
We been on the low for a while
I been going solo now
