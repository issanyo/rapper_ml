[Intro: Future, Jim Jones]
The movie, damn sure is a movie…nigga
Don’t you judge me, look in the mirror nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Judge that bitch

[Hook: Future]
Yeah, yeah, yeah fucking these half price hoes with this bad ass attitude
Watch me take the game to another altitude
Get fly everyday on my agenda, fuck a bruise…
…all I remember
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t judge me nigga, it gets spooky
We from the streets, we from the streets, we from the streets
But don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t you judge me

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
You can’t judge me without a lawyer with me
And don’t judge me because my toys is pretty
My guns is loaded, my bitch is bad
And when the summer roll make sure that all my whips is fast
When winter come, the trucks is big
Mike Tyson attitude nigga fuck your kids
You little niggas, we does it big
And for my fly bitches they love the kid, hey baby
She on dolphins I don’t mean Miami
I had the gun bolging, you can see the swammy
Pissy footsteps while a bitch hug me
I was sipping bubbly why you niggas wanna judge me

[Hook: Future]
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We from the streets, we from the streets, we from the streets
But don’t you judge me, no no no, yeah yeah yeah
Don’t you judge me
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
You can’t judge a book by its covers
Where I’m from, you can’t judge a crook by his color
We was hungry, we started cooking butter
So I asked the lord, why you throw us in this gutter
I’m tryna play, but that don’t play the bills
And going bankrupt will give me crazy chills
Staring at the judge when I was facing trial
I recall I gave my lawyer like 80 thous
For every crime I was acquitted
And I should be facing time for all the crimes committed
Roll murda,… he tell me come and visit
Hop board, on my time is like a fucking..

[Hook: Future]
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We from the streets, we from the streets, we from the streets
But don’t you judge me, no no no, yeah yeah yeah
Don’t you judge me
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Future]
The movie, lets toast to the life
More … Louis Vuitton…the average nigga
Cash on deliver, work flowing like a nigga
…this is big bizness
Cold silence, just to stand beside me
These bitches cause a riot
There’s red bottoms everywhere I go
We gettin money in the hood nigga that’s for su’
Go to Vegas with the elephant nights
Smashing on this bitch with them jellos shots…

[Hook: Future]
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We from the streets, we from the streets, we from the streets
But don’t you judge me, no no no, yeah yeah yeah
Don’t you judge me
Don’t you judge me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
