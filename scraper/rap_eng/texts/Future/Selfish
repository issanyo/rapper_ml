[Intro: Rihanna]
Oooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly

[Bridge: Rihanna & Future]
Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns
Saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Rihanna]
Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh, let's not be alone

Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

[Chorus: Future & Rihanna]
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight
Tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Future]
I just hit the lick, south of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies
Ain't no love without us
It will die
Roses turn into dust
Every night
We gettin' more popular
Wrong is right
When it comes to us

[Chorus: Future & Rihanna]
Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Tonight, let's be selfish
Selfish, tonight, tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Rihanna & Future]
I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah
Ooooh, oooo-oooo-oooh
I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Let's be
Let's be selfish
Yeah, yeah
