[Intro]
Done ran along to the club
Trying to leave a nigga for nothing
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I’m out here thugging
I’m missing all your touching
I ain’t fell in love with no pussy
I ain’t fell in love with no pussy
Done ran all through the club
Trying to leave a nigga for nothing
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I’m out here thugging
I’m missing all your touching
Ain't never fell in love with pussy
Ain't fell in love with no pussy

[Verse 1]
You want all my money
You want all my fame
You want to run to the club
Trying to fuck up my name
I ain’t never been dishonorable
I took a chance on you
I even took you 'round my homies
Something I never do

I’m drinking and flashing a Rollie
Either you stay or you’re going
I am never going to talk shit but from the beginning I knew I could afford it
Here, carry my 40
And you thought I would.. oh, baby

[Hook]
I ain’t fell in love with no pussy
Ain’t fell in love with no pussy
Done ran off to the club
Trying to leave a nigga for nothing
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I’m out here thugging
I’m missing all your touching
Ain’t never fell in love with pussy
Ain’t fell in love with no pussy

[Verse 2]
Fuck you on your back
Fuck you layin over
Fuck you just like that
Fuck you in the car
Fuck you in the club
Fuck you in the studio
Never made love
Fuck you on your knees
Fuck you in the butt
Fuck you when you’re drunk
Fuck you, beat it up
Just fuck you everywhere
Fuck you everywhere
Fuck you from the back
Fuck you, pull your hair
Fuck you and choke you
Fuck you like a teen
Fuck you like a king
Fuck you like a queen
Fuck you like a star
Fuck you like celebrity
Fuck you like I'm rich
Fuck you like I’m broke

[Hook]
