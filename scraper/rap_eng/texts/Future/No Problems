[Intro]
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Overdose)
(Young Francis on the Drogas)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Five niggas, counted five niggas, all inside of that roller coaster
Loop-de-loop, over and over
Dope Francis, pullin' Drogas
Shaka Zulu in the tub, holdin' toasters, nigga what?
In the club, on the sofa, on the wall he got two chains
On her titties boy, that's a motorboat or
You can go with Noah or go overboard or
Life of Pi, so crazy, Silver Surfer, so wavy
Beat Army, go Navy, so cool, go baby
Gold and blue, so navy, old school, I'm so 80's
Drop verses, top earnin', convert a bird and I'm so Shady
Keith Richards, I'm no Grady
I'm all tsunami, can't point break me
I'm so

[Hook: Future]
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Lupeland, carnival, Barnum & Bailey pardon you
Replace car with barre, barnival
Lose control, bumper car or two, lose control
Like funnel cake from that fun house, you lose an arm or two
Doin' battle with the bottles like a baller too
Like a carnivore at a bar-b-que
Art of war, arsenal
I'm level four and your armor two
Nigga that don't match, armadillo
That don't rap, what's wrong with you, that's detrimental
Homeboy, residential mind state
Existential Rolex, Presidential, time waits
For no man that I've ever met
Tell him no standard that I've ever set
Live right now like it's better yet
Treat a trash can like a treasure chest
Don't jump ship for a better deck
Or dump chips on a better bet
Don't change gangs for a less set
Full of fake niggas to get better checks
When it's real niggas that ain't never never left
Their good ghetto for a better mess
And my father told me just die well
So I'ma do my best to have a better death
And give a lot cause your deeds speak when you resurrect
Bout revolution ain't ready yet
But you don't never know so don't ever guess on letter X
Lupeland, freak show, eyes all in that peep hole
You believe that you know that girl but I don't really think so

[Hook: Future + Lupe Fiasco]
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'

[Outro]
Paris skirt in her Paris heels
Where we at? Where is real?
Lupeland, cotton candy, carousals, ferris wheels
I don't want no problems
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just playin', I'm gon' kill em'
Where your niggas?
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
