[Chorus: Future]
I don't even think you know how much I fuck with you
It's too much money involved can't make me lose
You playing police games wassup with you?
You made me feel like I never should've had love for you

[Verse 1: Future]
It's getting to me, been on my mind feel it in my gut too
You gon make me drop a tear trynna fuck with you
I won't hesitate to kill anyone trynna fuck with you
Ima split this pill up with my brother Woo
Bitch can't love me like my niggas then fuck you
Ima smash, pass you off, make me slut you
Your new attitude too sassy and it's cutting through
Before the TASK Force come get me Ima touch you

[Chorus: Future]
It's dead weight on my shoulders
Trynna hold back all my emotions
All this drama bringing devotion
Trynna slow me down gotta keep on going, yeah yeah
I don't even think you know how much I fuck with you
It's too much money involved can't make me lose
You playing police games wassup with you?
You made me feel like I never should've had love for you

[Verse 2: FBG Wookie]
Who would ever though that it would be the last time made love to you?
Never would've thought that I would regret the fact I trusted you
Trusted you, how the hell I trusted you?
Gave you more went and took less
Went and took less I gave you extra
His and her, forget about it
Counting these checks, forget about it
Private jets, forget about it
Fuck my ex forget about her
Smashed your friend on a young nigga shit, I hope you didn't forget about it
Plane Jane, AP, Audemar fit I went and got another, forget about it
Told you keep that shit one thousand
Instead you tried to be slick about it
Your right hand leaning to the left to the left
This my house get your shit up out here
Ima keep getting this cash homie
I ain't even feeling the red Act on me
Went and murdered that stack, homie
Keep securing this bag, homie

[Chorus: Future]
I don't even think you know how much I fuck with you
It's too much money involved can't make me lose
You playing police games wassup with you?
You made me feel like I never should've had love for you
It's dead weight on my shoulders
Trynna hold back all my emotions
All this drama bringing devotion
Tryna slow me down gotta keep on going, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
