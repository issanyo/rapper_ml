[Intro]
Freak hoes, Freak hoes
Freak hoes, Freak hoes

[Hook]
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door

[Verse 1]
Titanic on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Did a donut in the 6, I just drove by Magic City
Put the heron in the bricks, put the heron in the bricks
Put the heron in the bricks, ain't nothing change, I got it
On a worldwide treasure hunt, blowin' good Guinea
Pretty girls reppin' "Pretty Gang" fuckin' wit the kiddo
Type to fuck a hood nigga good, then tell em "ditto"
Went from 5 on the indo, 30 rounds in the extendo
Fuck a friend though, ain't pretend though
Nigga comin' through sprayin' at the window
Get the memo, got a line, on Chyna White
But I ain't giving out no info
Get to bendin' corners like a nigga ridin' in a limo
I been in the pussy all day, at the cribbo
I fuck a bitch, she tell her friend, I love some free promo
I love a freak ho tho...

[Hook]
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door

[Verse 2]
Whole lot of dirty soda and some bad bitches
Put some rose on some gold tryna overdose
Made a ho eat a ho cuz she a broke ho
Got that check on me, nigga that's a fo' fo'
My Cuban Linx bigger than the Wu Tang
Lil nigga take your head off for a new chain
I send my side bitch out to St. Barts
I ride around town with a AR

[Hook]
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
