[French Intro]
Il me plait d'être avec tu
Je ne sais pas où
Il me plait d'être avec tu
Je ne sais pas où

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
I was thinking to myself
While I was staring at your body over me
That I don't need nobody else
I love your kisses when they're long
And they're deep, run your fingers through my hair
The way you touch me, yeah I know it's meant to be
We can do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
I make your wishes baby one, two, three

[Hook: Tinashe]
How many times can we make love in one night?
(One night, yeah)
How many times can we make love in one night?
How many times can we make love in one night?
(Turn up, turn up, turn up yeah)

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
As I look in to your eyes
It's like I'm staring in another galaxy
I don't know what's on your mind
But it's like you done became a part of me
We're having breakfast in the bed
Know I love the way you scramble in the sheets
I'm 'bout to take it your head
I'm making wishes baby one, two, three

[Hook: Tinashe]
How many times can we make love in one night?
(One night yeah)
How many times can we make love in one night?
How many times can we make love in one night?
(Turn up, turn up, turn up, pitch it, pitch it, whoa, whoa, pitch it, whoa, pitch it, hey)

[Verse 3: Future]
Hit ya from the backseat
Smokin' hot pot beat
I'mma hit ya hard
I'mma put your face in the pillow
Split you like a cigarillo
Kiss you till you catch a feeling 'round your nipple
Turn up on a nigga
(Straight Up)
Turn up, turn up, in your mouth
(Straight Up)
Bend you over on the couch
Baby, get in the mix
Young fit mixed chick
Fuck you like real dick
Shit, bitch, lick, lick, lick

[Hook: Tinashe]
How many times can we make love in one night?
(One night, one night, one night whoa baby)
How many times can we make love in one night? (make love c'mon)
How many times can we make love in one night?
(Yeah, that's right, turn it up)
