[Intro: Future]
Crazy funk, baby, this a crazy funk

Aspiration, baby, I need extra motivation
You some inspiration, now we 'bout to hit the latest
Recognize me, you gon' recognize me

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign + 24hrs]
She say that she wanna stay over
But I like to stay all alone
I fucked that bitch to my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I put that bitch in my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I put that bitch in my song

[Bridge: 24hrs]
She wanna stay in my home
I like to sleep all alone
She kept on blowing my phone
I fucked that bitch to my song
Yeah, I fucked that bitch to my song
I put that bitch in my song
20, this my favorite song
So I fucked that bitch to my song

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign + 24hrs]
She throw that ass in a circle
Smoking on that new purple
Geeked up off that Urkel
Throwing that ass in a circle
Fucking on molly and Xans
Gripping that ass in my hands
She say Dolla, you the man
She say Dolla be my man
She like the way I get money
I told her leave 'em and he bore me
She doing tricks with her tongue for me
She bring her friend and another for me

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign + 24hrs]
She say that she wanna stay over
But I like to stay all alone
I fucked that bitch to my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I put that bitch in my song
I fucked that bitch to my song
I put that bitch in my song

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign + 24hrs]
20 my new favorite artist
Dolla, we just getting started
She out off the Henny and molly
Light skinned from the Valley
I fucked that bitch to my song
I got somewhere with my drawers off
Dolla, I know that bitch stoned
She say Dolla, that's my favorite song

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She say that she wanna stay over
But I like to stay all alone
I fucked that bitch to my song
I fucked that bitch to my song

[Outro]
Oohh-ohhhh-ohhhh
