[Intro: Jo Rodeo]
I know what she see in me
A bossed up smooth criminal
Baby girl stay true to me
Imma always stay real with you

[Hook: Future]
You see how things coulda been for us
I bought a brand new Benz for us
I was gonna give  the tussin up
Before I ever give the hustling up
Me fall in love it's dangerous
Damn I feel like I've done suffered enough
She can never see the good, the good
She doing for me
Usually I take me a bad one
Bad one, bad one, bad one
And cuff her, you did me good
You did me good
Just by not loving me baby
I'm from the hood, I'm from the hood
Except that life come wit me baby
Except that life come wit me baby
Except all my savages come wit me baby

[Verse 1: Jo Rodeo]
I see the good in her
I'm feeling good with her
Roll me some backwoods
Ride through the hood with her
Baby my backbone
Call her my right hand
Treat you like a queen
She found the right man
Got some red bottoms
Shawty stay down keep your head right
Imma be there if the head right
Laying next to you yeah every night
Bend it over, slide into it
It ain't nothing but to do it
Bubble gum that's how I'm chewing
Body sweat, dripping fluids

[Bridge: Jo Rodeo]
I know what she see in me
A bossed up smooth criminal
Baby girl stay true to me
Imma always stay real with you

[Hook: Future]
You see how things coulda been for us

I was gonna give  the tussin up
Before I ever give the hustling up
Me fall in love it's dangerous
Damn I feel like I've done suffered enough
She can never see the good, the good
She doing for me
Usually I take me a bad one
Bad one, bad one, bad one
And cuff her, you did me good
You did me good
Just by not loving me baby
I'm from the hood, I'm from the hood
Except that life come wit me baby
Except that life come wit me baby
Except all my savages just come wit me baby

[Verse 2: Future]
I been laying low when the bay was some badass shit yeah
I wasn't in my right state of mind last year
I ignored every sign that was sent to me
I didn't want to ruin my legacy
Shawdy at home with the baby body gone what she don't no
Bitch ain't never did love, who knew
I can feel that shit tryna kill a nigga ego
I get fly like a eagle tryna do it
Numbers just like the Beatles
Tryna do numbers like the Beatles, that's a mufuckin popstar
Bitch I'm a rockstar, gotta pop a few pills just to stay up
On a whole lot of lean gotta stay up
I know emotions, you don't believe in these moves that I'm putting in motion
My vision is deeper than any ocean
I know that love will turn on you

[Hook: Future]
You see how things coulda been for us
I bought a brand new Benz for us
I was gonna give  the tussin up
Before I ever give the hustling up
Me fall in love it's dangerous
Damn I feel like I've done suffered enough
She can never see the good, the good

Bad one, bad one, bad one
And cuff her, you did me good
You did me good
Just by not loving me baby
I'm from the hood, I'm from the hood
Except that life come wit me baby
Except that life come wit me baby
Except all my savages come wit me baby
