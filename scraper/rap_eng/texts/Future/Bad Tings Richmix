Swap out your Gucci for coochie

Harder you go, the more money you get
The more money you get, the more shit you could go buy
You grind up and fuck to the top

I filled out your watch with some rocks (wise)
Got rich, and bought the whole block that I grew up on
That's how you do it

Right talkin' money, talkin' she speakin' fluent
I'm working that wood, she know how to do it
