I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you drinkin'
I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what you niggas drinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'

[Verse 1]
John F Kennedy nigga
My style straight up killing you niggas
Red bottom, Balenciaga, Balmain
Like I got a bald head, nigga Michael jordan
Come and fly with me I'm on a private jet
Come and smoke with me I smoke a pound of ses
Rich Gang nigga I can get you out a lot of debt
Big faced chicks, like I hit the Georgia Lottery
Like I hit the jackpot too
Any bitches coming by the three
I'm at the royal pawn with all the ice
Build a hundred thousand on some dice

[Hook]
I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you drinkin'
I got an appetite for frame type

I don't know what you niggas drinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'

[Verse 2]
I done washed my hands, with a lot of mula
Choppers in the night nigga, Freddie Krueger
Niggas scared, a million dollars
Run for president and they dead
Muhammed Ali nigga Cassius Clay
Hit the vault with the dope like anime
Beat the dope till the dope won't whip
Four Fifths hanging off a nigga hips
Spent eighty thousand bands Sak's Fifth
Twenty bucks from a hundred on the shoes
Spin your top nigga, put you on the news
Spent two-hundred-thirty-thousand on a coupe

[Hook]
I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'

I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'

[Verse 3]
Driving under the influence of Benjamins
Ski mask over my face I'mma business man
Sixteen ounces of raw codeine
Swapped out five Ms with whoadie
These bitches that don't understand what go on behind the scene
I'm rocking my gold Audemar and that bitch will bling
You watching my watches
Not even knowing what my shit costs
Most of these niggas faking fugazi and they flossin'
Leasing your car, renting your jewelry, saying you bosses
Title the cars, title the houses, and my office
On the dime, my brother, my la familia, I'mma off him
Rich nigga shit I'm turning down million dollar offers

[Hook]
I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you drinkin'
I got an appetite for frame type
My lil' young nigga leave you niggas stanky
I don't know what you niggas drinkin'
I don't know what the fuck you thinkin'
