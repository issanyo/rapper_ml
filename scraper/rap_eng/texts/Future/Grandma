[Intro]
I ain't scared, fuck that

[Hook]
Caught a 7 brick nap when I put that on my grandma
Serve a bag of keisha, but I'm always smokin' granddad, yeah
And I put that on my grandma, how I go and get that llama
And I put that on my grandma, yeah
You want that work, I'm pullin' up, I'll send it through the air
I put that on my first cousin, I got brick fair
You want that work, I'm pullin' up, I'll send it through the air
I put that on my first cousin, I got brick fair

[Verse]
9 millimeter I'm my brothers keeper
(I'm my brothers keeper)
Brand new pair of boots, servin' out the wraith
Trappin' out the Regal, bought a key again
Popped a gram of molly, workin' on some thotties
Sacrificed the plug and went and bought another plug
We out here straight finessin', aye, fuck the great depression
I hope ya learned ya lesson, cook it for ya buy it
Pull up in a [?], stash it in the tiger
Hotter than a jolly, whip the pot right by the fire
Turnin' on the fire, lean it to the side
(?) ya heart, ya almost lost it
36 grams of coke and you didn't even know what it cost ya
Got the migos callin'
