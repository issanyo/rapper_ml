[Intro: Future]
Freebandz
Forever
Forever Freebandz
Yeah
I got love for my niggas

[Hook: Future]
Cause I've been hangin' with them jackals, my lil dog caught a M
Doe Boy got out on a robbery, he came home to a M
Play your role then get exposed then
Shit, I might kidnap all my old friends
It's a lot of animosity I can't hold in
I get Pooh Gutta to kick your door in

[Verse 1: Doe Boy]
I ain't gotta rob no more bitch, I came home to a M
Got this big ass .40 on me, gotta walk with a limp
Nigga went against the gang so we had to send a hit
Police caught me, chased me down, bitch I was tryna' hit the fence
Ridin' 'round with the Ruger, I'm a real pistol user
We ain't fuckin' with no rapper, I might rob ya' with Young Scooter
I'm a savage, nigga, I'm your favorite rapper's favorite shooter
He ain't gon' have no fuckin' future, let a nigga play with Future
Once my nigga down for murder, free my dogs out the pen
If I feel my nigga fakin', fuck around and rob my friend
Shooters come shoot up your block, then they slidin' through again
I can't go out like no ho I took my time on the chin


[Hook: Future]
Cause I've been hangin' with them jackals, my lil dog caught a M
Doe Boy got out on a robbery, he came home to a M
Play your role then get exposed then
Shit, I might kidnap all my old friends
It's a lot of animosity I can't hold in
I get Pooh Gutta to kick your door in

[Verse 2: Future]
Big body surfin' in a benzo
All these diamonds on me lookin' like a disco
New channely and I ran it up on ten toe
Thirty two ? cashed out for my kinfolk
That's a third breed stallion, ?
Crocodile alligator, I'ma coat one
It seem like everyday my nigga catchin' bodies
If Doe Boy said fuck it then it's homicidal

[Hook: Future]
Cause I've been hangin' with them jackals, my lil dog caught a M
Doe Boy got out on a robbery, he came home to a M
Play your role then get exposed then
Shit, I might kidnap all my old friends
It's a lot of animosity I can't hold in
I get Pooh Gutta to kick your door in

[Outro: Future]
Shit, we ain't never gon' get back to how it was
See we be posted on the backstreet with the drugs
We put ? on your car, just give it up
I trapped it out and stacked it up then bought the clubs
You gang gang, you made men, you can't be touched
This money will make you feel untouchable
And when it rain I feel untouchable
If you claim what I claim then you untouchable
