[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating, UFO, UFO

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
She say she want somebody she can talk to
I always say I will but I never do
She says she need somebody she can count on
And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl, now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl, I can't be that somebody every day
She say she';; find somebody if it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back) That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head, she said I never did
(Boy give me a call back) She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart, she 'bout to break my heart

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low

Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating, UFO, UFO

[Verse 2: Tink]
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat then I have no standards
Fuck that, tonight I'mma live
Find me someone in these streets
Freak on him slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me, no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believe him, you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game (game)
Treat all these hoes the same (same)
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like Bey
You ain't gotta hide your face
'Cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

[Verse 3: Future]
Where your heart went? You must lost it in a coffin, hey-ey-ey
I'm smoking, taking me loses, I can't cry about you, no way-ay-ay
I'm a playa but it caught me off guard, I'mma say-ay-ay
Bitches don’t cheat on niggas this rich, bitch, you must be a misfit
I'm drinking, fucking my kidney, you got my going ballistic
Don't tell me you kissing niggas with my favorite lipstick
Not my bitch
Mamacita, no love lost, used to moving them drugs off
When a nigga he-a serve you
They come back and run up in your drug house
You lying bitch, who you lying to, tell me who you lying to
You rather taint my impression, how I look at you, how I honor you
We spent days up, I'm just thinking, did you get laid up?
Talking and conversating, hoping you tell me the truth
I thought I was bulletproof, until I found out a clue
You might be fucking him and him
And every brother around this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
He can't fuck you like me anyway, you must be getting back at me
Maybe my mind's playing tricks on me
I'm feeling guilty cause these hoes on me
