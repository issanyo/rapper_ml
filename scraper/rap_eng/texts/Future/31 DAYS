[Intro]
Zaytoven
Every now and then, you know what I'm sayin'
Most of the majority of the time
You dig
We in that mode

[Verse 1]
This is a moment of clarity
Everything VV's, I'm gone to the maximum
Young nigga flood out a 'axima
Flawless the face, then run through a pack of them
Everything classical, everything magical
When they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah
Depending on the caliber, put on the passenger
Whatever time, wherever I was at
Look on the calendar, yeah we compatible
I have her flying wherever I'm at
You astronomical, way too phenomenal
I have her naked where I land
I got a second option, and fourth
And fifth one wherever a nigga staying
I had it falling right out of my pocket
When I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin'
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France
She caramel, without getting a tan
I need to pay her when I get the chance
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash
Talkin' that shit, he get smoked like a blunt
Took a few Pakistanians to lunch
Got some little slim shit in Milan
These niggas be hatin', putting on a front

[Chorus]
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil slob on my tee
I done took a little E, I fucked her and made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page

[Verse 2]
Doing it on a chinchilla, oh yeah
You fucking a couple of strippers together
Shawty my rider, she down for whatever
Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the Cs
I'm on a whole 'other level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they could all come and sleep with us
We don't do nothing that's normal, everything we do is super gigantic
We don't put on fugazi, everything we wear super Titanic
I just caught me a wave, feel like a nigga done jumped in Atlantic
One hell of a car collection, pulling it up, it's panoramic
Picked her up in a Cayenne, soon as she got in she got nothing on

[Chorus]
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil slob on my tee
I done took a little E, I fucked her, made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
