All this money on me, do you wanna see?
All this money on me, do you wanna see?
All this money on me, do you wanna see?
All this money on me, do you wanna see?
Fuck 50s, all hundreds, big tree, I'm blunted
Bad bitch, dime a dozen, real niggas keep shit jumpin' cause
All this money on me, do you wanna see?
All this money on me, do you wanna see?

[Verse 1: Future]
Let's fuck up some cash, all of my cars are 200 apiece
I'ma just light up some grass, and I'ma smoke it, I'm smokin' OG
I'ma just count up this money and fuck on a freak
Richest young nigga just pullin' in rolls, fuckin' on hoes
They come by the load, I'm 'bout to expload
Gonna be drinkin' a bottle, don't I drink it straight out the bottle
Then I show you how to whip it with no problem
Then I give game to you, then I give game to you
Don't all the money and cars come with the game that I roll with
100 racks on me, now I'ma splurge it
You can't walk up on my niggas, you gon' get murdered
All this drank and on mollys, it got me nervous
And I keep diamonds around me, these bitches thirsty

[Verse 2: Pooca Leroy]
You wanna see? (See what?)
Independent young nigga, no deal but I still got Louis on me
100K slight work, we gettin' to the money
Do you want a piece? (Hell yeah)
A little thick ass ho want tickets to the show
Just you and your niece?
Let me go check with Future and see
Who rockin' with TECs?
You gonna be all day tryna count all these diamonds I got in my necklace
Quick pause at the light 'fore I swing to the right
Drop the top and finesse
Baby 9 on my side when I'm ridin'
I ain't lyin' but the chopper the best
It stop all the press
I promise my niggas I got 'em
I gotta go get 'em and put 'em in Bentleys and diamonds
Put 'em in different positions to show 'em somethin' different
From trappin' and nickel and dimin'
They saw me come up from a buck with no gas
In the truck, we was stuck, time after time
To fuckin' with Future, Versace, Medusa
We mobbin' and shinin', you know I ain't lyin'
