[ verse 1: Big Sean ]

Uh huh
Bitch watch  how you speak to me
I been working all week and I know I need cccc’s
Tryn get paid repeatedly
Jamaica and cank now that’s where I need to be
Credit card use to be E-B-T it ain’t either that’s D-E-B-T
I been thinking about becoming a cop so I can murder niggas and run of legally
I talk that real shit but that’s why they lovin it
Watch out for this itty tree
And it’s like it’d the mothership
Was talking to my dad tho on some other shit
He’s like man slow down with the girls your fuckin wit
If they ain’t a quarterback it’s no point of rushin it
Don’t make the same  mistakes I made with your mother but that’s on some other shit look
I’m in the risk In takin it I’m in the making it
Thinking I can make it like I ain’t make it yet
There’s a rehab for a workohaulic I been thinking about shaking it
I have had a Rolex longer then I had relationships
I’m embarrassed to say that shit
But I’ve been working on my self and that’s the most important work even if you don’t get paid for it
Call me the greatest
Don’t call up no favors
Call up my Savior
Like thank you god look at all we created
I started rapping biggie smalls in the basement
And now we...

[hook:Future]

I’m sippin my codeine
From the beginning
She trucked my whole team
She saw us winning
We like nigga on the set life
Come see us living
This one for my dogs in the one way and penitentiaries
And you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up
I need some more attention
She ain’t wanna play fight
I put her on suspension
I put a key on greyhound now I’m in a new dimension
I offered a 25
He tried to take some of my percentage
I was terrified

[verse 2: 21 savage]

Grab me a bowl
And grab me a fork
And I get in that shit and go crazy
Them diamonds on me they blangin and blangin so icy you can go skating
Blow!
Bitch I’m young savage I fuck up a check
Then fuck me a nigga old lady 21
Bitch I’m cold I need a blanket brr
Yeah I’m bout my check yeah
Rollie’s on me flooded out with baguettes
Raw niggas and I cheat on my ex
Prettt titties
I might skeet on her breast
Skeet on her breast
Eighthy  thousand put that shit on my neck
Eighty thousand
Spent that shit on a vet
When I’m saying this
I just forget
Yeah hold up
Cerrack and patron got me faded
Hold up wait these bitches gon fuck if I blink
I run through the money you can’t
Get faded and fuck up the bank 21
Bitch I’m all drunk I can’t think
You can’t hang around if you ain’t
