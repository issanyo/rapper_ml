[Hook: Future & MvdS] X2
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won
A trophy

[Verse 1: MvdS]
You are the goal to my plan, you are the queen on my board
Want to buy you the biggest diamonds that this boy can afford
But even if I was broke, you'd give me all that's in store
You are all the nominations to the Miss Perfect Award
The way you toy with my brain, it has me going insane
Say you ain't playing no games, well, you tell that to my brain
Cause you been running it, babe, and you finished in first
I'll put these diamonds on your body, like I'm Damien Hirst
I should call ya Mrs. Goddess, resident of my conscience
You simply take my breath away, leaving me feeling nauseous
Now proceed cautious, people like to show their jealousy
But I'll protect you, girl, they can spit their Hell on me
I'll take you out the eat and lay you down on the beach
And get us a something to drink, I'm talking two bottles each
We'll pour that Ace of Spades, and you'll put on your shades
And then I give your ass a dick that you would never trade

[Verse 2: MvdS]
You're my, you're my, you're my only one
That's why I wanna gift your ass my only son
And I will show you some
Things, you have never seen before
I wanna hear your Red Bottoms click on the marble floor
You wake me up giving head, I give you breakfast in bed
You wanna fuck me all night, yeah, we can sleep when we dead
Baby, finish your bread, so we can do it again
I feel her bite on my neck, she's feeding off of my skin
And I won't stop her, no, I wanna see her go
She throw that pussy in my lap, so we won't take it slow
I want to make it last, can't live without that ass
We wine and dine, I eat the pussy after we've drank a glass
We don't want this end, we'll stay in bed for a week
She good to me and my fam, but in the sheets, she's a freak
She's tearing open my shirt, I'm putting holes in her panty
Soon as she hit the high notes, I know this girl is a Grammy
It's M
