[Intro]
We workin'
It's the Holiday season

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
Flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexing on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like, my God
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
Dun Deal on the track
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
Flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexing on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em

[Verse 1: Future]
I blast off in a space coup
I'm way fresher than a tie and suit
That girl head was so good
I had to nickname her Snaggletooth
I'm awesome, I'm gnarly
I'm a rockstar, I'm way flyer than you
I'm Keller, I'm Bunguy, your girlfriend on my bullseye
I got to salute my plug, my plug he made me rich
I got to salute my homies, they turned up in this bitch
A bunch of bad girls in the club tonight
They want to take a nigga home
They want to go on that flight
I'm an astronaut and I'm an alien
And in this car with me is an immigrant
Them two doors they lift up and that turbo that's a robot
I'm leanin', I'm leanin', that drink taste like soda pop
Holiday, you got a classic, no Reebok

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
Flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexing on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like, my God
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like

[Verse 2]
Montana, hah, my God
OG tin, my eye
That purple drink, my high
Spent that half a mil' on my car
I be flexin' on 'em
That whole hood be battin' on 'em
Fuckboys, we steppin' on 'em
Your main bitch be checkin' on 'em
Mansion on my arm, got a Brinx truck in my wallet
Dealer suicide my doors, got thirty chains on my collar
Got your whole deal in my pocket
Big bands and we coppin'
Trayvon that hoodie
You fuckboys be luggin', hah
Flexin' on 'em, Ric Flair
Off the books, Shakespeare
Fireworks, wrist wear
New kicks drop next year
Me and Holiday hunnid to a ten
Breakin' hoes like a comma, talkin' couple Ms
Montana

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
Flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexing on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like, my God
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em
I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em, I'm flexin' on 'em like
