[Intro: Future]
I'ma tell y'all how serious it's gettin'
Super mothafuckin' Future
DJ Escomoecity, the coolest DJ on the mothafuckin' planet

[Chorus: Future]
Audemars the whip when I ride through
And I had snatched two Rollies
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high and I'm rollin'
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high, no focus
I got a check on me right now
And all my cards loaded
I got a check on me right now
See my watch is loaded
I got a check on me right now
All these hoes bogus
I got a check on me right now
I got a check on me, nigga
I got a check on me right now
I got a check

[Verse 1: Future]
They tryna tell me to turn down, I refuse to do it
They tryna tell me I'ma lose, I'm the undisputed
I just did a walkthrough and I bought a Cuban
Bunch of fake lawsuits, my attorney Jewish
I just bought a Benz with a walkthrough
And I had snatched two Presis
I'ma floss so you can see it, make your ass regret it
I'ma hit the pussy on the first night
Then I'm gonna snatch that Rollie
I got the streets on dynamite
I'm 'bout to cause an explosion
I'm 'bout to flex on 'em soon as I see 'em
They better know that I'm chosen
You see my watch and my chain and rings
Everything frozen
You see my face on the magazine
I'm gettin' global exposure
I count it up like a money machine
Then I get ready to blow it

[Chorus: Future]
I done bought a whip with a walk through, hold up
And I had snatched two Rollies
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high and I'm rollin'
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high, no focus
I got a check on me right now
And all my cars loaded
I got a check on me right now
See my watch is loaded
I got a check on me right now
All these hoes bogus
I got a check on me right now
I got a check on me, nigga
I got a check on me right now
I got a check

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I had to whip in a rice pot
I had the check in a Nike box
I got a way on the jump out
Station that checked my Nike socks
Still playing with the white rocks
Nigga this time no Vice Watch
Heart colder than a ice box
Hit your daughter while your wife watch
Call me Mr. Nice Watch
Ice the wrist like it's swollen nigga
Boy that's a Fisher Price watch
All you my first Rollie niggas
Better go get your check up, yeah
I ain't talkin' no doctor though
Use the paper as my excuse
Treat the money like a doctor note
Neck heavy, got welts on it
Got a gold like Phelps on it
Heard that girl go to work with it
Treat the dick like "help wanted"
Tell them haters they can Yelp on it
Bitch we eatin' good
Might cop me a Bentley truck
I like to be in the hood

[Chorus: Future]
I done bought a whip with a walk through, hold up
And I had snatched two Rollies
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high and I'm rollin'
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high, no focus
I got a check on me right now
And all my cars loaded
I got a check on me right now
See my watch is loaded
I got a check on me right now
All these hoes bogus
I got a check on me right now
I got a check on me, nigga
I got a check on me right now
I got a check
