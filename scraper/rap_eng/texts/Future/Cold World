[Intro: Future & Zona Man]
Oh yeah
Pluto
Zona, mm-hmm, yeah yeah
Cold world, can't even trust my partner
All my life been duckin' narcotics
Rapper trapper, tell him need to choose
These niggas hatin', I know they waitin' on me to lose

[Verse 1: Zona Man]
So I shine on 'em, these V's blind on 'em
As soon Brooks pull up with beat, don't waste no time on 'em
A life of crime homie, I keep a nine on me
And for them days that it was dark, keep some shine on me
I got paid, stayed the same, and ain't change up
And all them niggas that was hatin' ain't came up
You out here focused on a nigga, we focused dollars
I sleep with robbers, 'cause them my partners
I feed the killers, 'cause them my niggas
And if I have to send a message, they gon' get you
Drake and Future, diamonds dancing on these bitches
I ain't tryna tell you twice lil nigga, get the picture, yeah

[Chorus: Zona Man]
I ain't never wanna be a baller
I was with the trappers and the robbers
Fuck school 'cause I ain't even go
Teacher lookin' for me, I ain't even show
Cold world, can't even trust my partner
All my life been duckin' narcotics
Rapper trapper, tell him need to choose
These niggas hatin', I know they waitin' on me to lose

[Verse 2: Future]
Yeah, ayy tsunami watch, tsunami blocks
Big rocks, lead cocked, yeah
Hold up, this young sensei
Racks taller than Dikembe
Racks fill me up, then I can't come back to my senses
Part K, that good yay
I ball hard like Doc J, Cartier on my shades
Left school in the midday, had to run it up with no delay
Skrrt skrrt, hit the pot, skrrt skrrt, hit the pot
Never wanted be a baller, I just want my money taller
I been with the robbers, I been with the scammers
Bought an extra extendo 'cause this life ain't nothin' but a gamble
Paid a thousand dollars for a t-shirt by Chanel
Every time the homies touch down we buyin' bales, Pluto

[Chorus: Zona Man]
I ain't never wanna be a baller
I was with the trappers and the robbers
Fuck school 'cause I ain't even go
Teacher lookin' for me, I ain't even show
Cold world, can't even trust my partner
All my life been duckin' narcotics
Rapper trapper, tell him need to choose
These niggas hatin', I know they waitin' on me to lose

[Verse 3: Bump J]
I ain't step foot up in the class
I was in that hoodie and that mask
I would chop it up and put it in the bag
Block like DP, nigga pull up for the cash
Treat this nigga like my blood
On my blood he put them people on me, keep it on me
Drum in that heater look like a speaker on it
You ain't even know about them thirties back when we was on 'em
My lil niggas creatures, hit your block and go to tweakin' on it
I need you to lower them prices, I hope the folks ain't listenin'
Wild nigga fresh out the system, I got them vultures with me
We ain't checkin' in with no niggas, we ball on any court
Bentley sport, treat Barneys and Saks like it's a City Sports, G

[Chorus: Zona Man]
I ain't never wanna be a baller
I was with the trappers and the robbers
Fuck school 'cause I ain't even go
Teacher lookin' for me, I ain't even show
Cold world, can't even trust my partner
All my life been duckin' narcotics
Rapper trapper, tell him need to choose
These niggas hatin', I know they waitin' on me to lose
