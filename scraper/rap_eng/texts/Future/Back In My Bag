[Hook]
I’m back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back

[Verse 1]

Back in my bag like a ransom
Back in my bag like I’m snacking
I go through a lot so my heart is heavy
I’m moving weight like a fat kid

I feel like an improper fraction
There’s no in between I’m either black or white




I guess I feel like Michael Jackson
I’m the man like Pac
I’m well trained on the track
They make you pick the cotton then sell shirt
But leave that trash on the rack
I don’t rap I attack
I’m on point like a tack
I see some people getting mad
Cause I was gone but now I’m back

[Hook]
I’m back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back





[Verse 2]
I’m back in
They lookin like who let them cats in
But I'm not a cat, I'm not a dog
If I'm not the goat, I'm a dragon
They ducking the fade they quackin
I know some grown men who wanna act 10
Cause they know they’ll never
Be the man again
I just act like I’m a mannequin
Because they don’t deserve no reaction
They funny actin, it got my laughin
I’m back in my bag
Like I’m packing
I travel cuz I'm in the NBA and y'all Pac-10
I don't have it all, but I'm not lacking
I’m not harassing
I’m just asking
If I can take her out like an extraction
I got so much drive but I’m back in
Reverse
Play this song at the church
God is great, God is good
My girl is bad, and I’m worse
I stomp on the beat like I'm Kirk




I wear it out like some merch
God said the last gon' be first
So I got it poppin like a perk
You can’t play this game from the bleachers
So I practice everything I’m preaching
Don’t call me fam cause we ain’t related
If you got my blood it’s cause you leaching
I be on stages but I don’t act
I’mma last forever but don’t got no tats
I feel like Jesus gone play this song
When the sky crack like
I was gone but now I’m back

[Hook]
I’m back
Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)




God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back

[Outro]
And I shoulda never left
It's Aha, man
Oh, they gon' ride
They gon' ride
(It's Aha)
