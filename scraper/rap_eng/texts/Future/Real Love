[Intro: Future]
I bet she love
I bet she love, love
I bet she

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
It's true I said I love you but I didn't promise it
We came from grippin' AK's, our fingers got bunions
Keypad, no key to my door
And we made love

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another Xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the States from another planet
I'm fly as a bitch, when I make mistakes, another plannin', yeah

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
Yeah, I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me)
I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me, I bet she loves me)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Showed major love to my friends, bitch
I dropped the top off the Benz
Been rockin' since creme de la creme, yeah
I know we never go in
I tat the footprint of my kids, yeah, like forensics
Throw it to the ceiling, can't forget
My big brother coming home from a bid, yeah
Turbo 9-11 coupe for the rich
Turbo 9-11 coupe for the rich, yeah
I fucked her friend, I'd never tell her
I feed the swoop peanut butter and jelly
Up a hundred mil, let my nigga tell it
Up a hundred mil
I done cracked a seal, let these haters tell it
But I cracked a seal
I can get 'em killed, yeah Kill Bill
And I got diamonds from my toes up to my ears
Yeah I got an implant 'cause I took off the veneers
Yeah I got a red diamond on the eye ring, not tears
Got the shirt off in the Rolls Royce, yeah
Put a hole on the Kel-Tec, 'cause I ain't tryna get killed yet, hmm

[Interlude: Future]
Love
I bet she love
I bet she love, love
I bet she love

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another Xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the States from another planet
I'm fly as a bitch, when I make mistakes, another plannin', yeah

[Verse 2: Future]
I don't give a fuck about big homie, I'm big homie 'round here
I'm rockin' blue diamonds, ain't nothin' to get you killed
You gonna get scarred, you don't get eternal life, nigga, yeah
Ballin' off of X before I rolled dice, nigga, yeah
The agent just called and said the Hawk was available, I'm ready
You all about the Hawk, nigga, that G5 is quality
It's pink, way more than I ever would've imagined
I didn't measure it so I'm higher than Aladdin
No swaps out, I'm undecided whenever I pop out
I had to swerve for four years, I'm still under forty thousand miles
Bought the Bentley coupe and a Bentley Spur on the same day
She drove the GT and fell in love with it the same day
She told me that was her favorite car, she dreamed about it
I couldn't walk away, my ego all in the way
I dropped cash on it, she told me she loved me even more (Freebandz)
These four doors and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, no, nothing seems to amaze me
I left on a commercial flight and downgraded
If I could change anything, I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
Had to be the formula, I'm not normal, I told you (I told you)
If you would've took the flesh out me (Took the flesh out me)
You would've ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma
(I bet she love me)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another Xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the States from another planet
I'm fly as a bitch, when I make mistakes, another plannin', yeah

[Outro: Future]
I bet she love, love
I bet she love, love
I bet she love, love
I bet she
I bet she love
