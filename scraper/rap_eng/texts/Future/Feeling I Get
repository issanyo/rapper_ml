(Intro)
This for my fans
From Atlanta to Japan
Ayy... The feeling I get,The feeling I get

[Hook]
You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true
That's why I do the things that I do
The feeling I get from you
The feeling i get from you
The feeling i get from you

(Verse 1)
Charisma,demeanor my lean go my to my vocab
Scribbing till you f*ck with me like moses
Vvs unloaded
These diamonds don't mean a thing to me
In my song I don't repeat
I been f*cked up inside the steets
I gotta think outside the street
I go hard for my n*ggas
Pray to God for my n*ggas
You part of me n*gga
When I'm standin front the center
Screaming every verse
If you leaning of the syrup
Or are you drinkin cold water
You drink the cold water
I f*ck wit you regardless
We know I feel (?)
We gotta feel important
I go the hardest
Pull lines off my song when I swear this sh*t will make you go the hardest

[Hook]
You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true

The feeling I get from you
The feeling i get from you

(Verse 2)
Ayyy when I'm standing on stage
And my song gettin played
Every mention that I get I truly appreciate that chance
I will take your words for granted cherish every single moment
You down on my song and play it every single morning
Hey girl I wish I could hug you for the rest of my life
I'm gonna remember your face for the rest of my life
Now I know bosses that solute me when the see me
The recognize the real man that's foe my cousin Keke
The feeling that I get when you f*ck with me I'm G-Key
I go to L.A. Come back write a hundred songs
I freestyle off the top my head like I ain't got no arms
I'm a writer,know the song like I ain't wrote no songs

[Hook]
You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems

Sacrificing quality time take em out to every single.moment every second of the day I see your face and paper chase it
Every second any day i f*ck with you the strong way
