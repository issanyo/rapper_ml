(Intro)
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win

(Hook)
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on the other side, getting it in
You niggas trying to put a cut, it’s not your business
I heard you say going down it’s going in
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win

(Verse)
Dressed in all black, body on the grass
Nigga sees his momma cry, damn it’s bad
Shouldn’t throw stones if your house is all glass
Me and my young niggas ride, we gonna blast
Choppers out the window, boy, move fast
I don’t give a fuck, boy, you won’t last
Hard to see my nigga Oz in the grass
So I don’t give a fuck, boy, that’s yo ass
One they just have a murda, he rode
One eighty seven, but you hoe
I don’t give a fuck, boy, and you know
Cause out there in the streets, boy, anything go

(Hook)
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on the other side, getting it in
You niggas trying to put a cut, it’s not your business
I heard you say going down it’s going in
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win

(Verse)
Ain’t no love for these pussy niggas
Homicide, DOA, know we’re coming to get you
They gonna do what I say, when I point they gonna spray
I got shooter fifteen, it’s FT and I ain’t met yo face
Home invading the double, murdering high as Kali
I’m screaming war crap, war paint and the boys are cheap
Done take with Master P, a whole mill to sign a lease
It’s a homicide, my run is killing on front street
And talk on the Oatie, MP and Fat Trel
Had to deal on a scale, get adapt or re-sale
Me and Eastwood, two twin choppers we sleepl good
Cut on me and throwing homicide, be to it

(Hook)
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on the other side, getting it in
You niggas trying to put a cut, it’s not your business
I heard you say going down it’s going in
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win

(Verse)
It’s a homicide, let them lamas ride
Aim for his eyes till his thighs till his momma cry
Ain’t nobody outside, I got him traumatized
Headin for ash wall, is on sick side
I do this every time, kill him on every line
Call me on my land line, you fucking with fair time
And I don’t know them niggas, I wasn’t fucking with them
I heard you was busting with them, I don’t even trust a nigga
Let’s call my mother nigga, I gets it in
I’m fucking niggas btches plus I fuck them bitches friends
All black Benz in my pocket like ten
And my rocket thirty shot, so you know my Glock wins

(Hook)
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on the other side, getting it in
You niggas trying to put a cut, it’s not your business
I heard you say going down it’s going in
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
We done seen so many murders and lost friends
Man I’m getting up in the cut just to win
