[Intro: Future]
Oh yeah, already ready
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
I don't think you like ... yeah yeah (gang)

[Chorus: Future]
Rockin' new Chanel and the icy
If you ain't got more than three hoes, then you ain't nothin' like me
I got a whole lotta cash on me, that's my ID
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like Xans
Hit a few llicks, it's excitin'
I fucked a bitch it's excitin'
Fucked her on the face, yeah
Ridin' in a Wraith, yeah
Molly and the drank, yeah
Fuckin' up cake, yeah

[Verse 1: Casino]
Flew three years straight, no ID, jumpin' on a private
Ghost waitin' on the runway, when I landed
Several models around, they go both ways
No luggage, get bags of cash, that's my wallet
Keep pistols and choppas around me, don't try me
You ain't gettin' no money, don't come around
You dead weight
I get a stripper and I dog her, I nut on her face
Lit up in diamonds and gold, I'm a idol
Whippin' a split to a whole, I know magic
Draped in all Chanel on the 4 wheeler
She hit me in my DM, I'ma go get her
Turn up when I want on you fuck niggas

[Chorus: Future]
Rockin' new Chanel and the icy
If you ain't got more than three hoes, then you ain't nothin' like me
I got a whole lotta cash on me, that's my ID
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like Xans
Hit a few llicks, it's excitin'
I fucked a bitch it's excitin'
Fucked her on the face, yeah
Ridin' in a Wraith, yeah
Molly and the drank, yeah
Fuckin' up cake, yeah

[Verse 2: Mexico Rann]
Expressway, I rape her face
Deep thoughts, deep vision
Dived in the pussy, that shit was deep
Deep sea fishin' on a big yacht
Pop the pistol, make 'em do the hopscotch
Make you dance like Sisqo
Old money like Nabisco
Plays all out in Frisco
Circle tight like a pyramid
Boss player speak, nigga, take notes
Kim K in every state I land
Call your boy Mexico Hefner
Go to sleep with the Glock on me
Gloves on, I ain't playin'
Three piece suit with the tie
.45 got a laser dot

[Chorus: Future]
Rockin' new Chanel and the icy
If you ain't got more than three hoes, then you ain't nothin' like me
I got a whole lotta cash on me, that's my ID
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like molly
I'm poppin' bands like Xans
Hit a few llicks, it's excitin'
I fucked a bitch it's excitin'
Fucked her on the face, yeah
Ridin' in a Wraith, yeah
Molly and the drank, yeah
Fuckin' up cake, yeah

[Verse 3: Gwop]
Pour that mothafuckin' pint
Fuckin' that bitch, she no saint
They say I'm up next, nigga, what did you think?
This bird on my chest, bet your lil' ho gon' blink
Hollup, my way Chanel, yeah
Juugin' the wells, yeah
You go by playin' for keeps
Fuck on that bitch, then delete
Fuck up the club with no ID
Young nigga playin' with keys
Gwop get the bands, try to learn me
Get the lean for free, fuck the pharmacy
Fat nigga, expensive garments
Gas bags of green like Kermit
Rollie on my wrist and I earned it
Young niggas with me, they workin'

[Chorus: Future]
Rockin' new Chanel and the icy
If you ain't got more than three hoes, then you ain't nothin' like me
I got a whole lotta cash on me, that's my ID
I'm poppin' bands like molly
