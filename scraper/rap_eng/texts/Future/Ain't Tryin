[Intro]
I'm way up here, for real I'm over here too you dig?
Running circles around these niggas
Running circles around these niggas, you know, crack

[Hook]
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas (I'm on gas)
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash (counting cash)
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk (going beserk)
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work (got this work)
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash (yea, yea)

[Verse 1]
I can't see no pussy nigga like I'm blind (like I'm blind )
Keep my finger on the trigger at all times (yea, yea)
For this cash I don't mind doing the crime (FBG)
Roll this flag in my pockets like I'm slime
Four door Phantom in your hood and I'm sliming (skrr, skrr)
I stay alert, I got millions on my mind (yea, yea)
Let's ante up, make me have to push your line
Bentley Spur with them goonies right behind me

[Verse 2]
Rolex shades, they don't make these in the States (that's a rollie)
Green faced Roll, I spent a 100k
40 milli Glock, .40 on my waist
A bunch of killers, dope dealers on the chase (gang, gang)
Fuck the snitches cause I'm still pushing weight
I'm getting it in and I came from off the crates
Let's eat again, we done already ate
Fuck the snakes, brought 'em over in a Wraith
