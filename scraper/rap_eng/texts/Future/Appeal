[Hook]x2
I got niggas down the road, waiting on an appeal
Living life through a pen, I hope they get their appeal
I hope they get their appeal

[Verse]
I just opened up the mailbox, four letters from my niggas
Who fucked up in the system, who got their head up with no a max date
Judge done married them niggas to the state, don’t give a fuck who life they take away
You get your time and they just walk away
Now you riding down that dirt lane
Shackled in chains, bout some petty change
That what folks say
Cuz you thinking bout your kids and they ain’t got a thing

[Hook]x2

[Verse]
John Gotti did that time a street nigga told on him
That’s why he doing that time a street nigga told on him
Guy Fisher doing his time a street nigga told on him
Big Meechie doing that time a street nigga told on him
In the street s you don’t wanna get caught up with dope boy product
You gon need an appeal, only snitches get deals
