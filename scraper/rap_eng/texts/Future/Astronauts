[Intro: Future]
Just like a astronaut
We don't detox
Yeah
Playin' in the mud, all these drugs
Like a weirdo (Yeah)
One of a kind, VVS diamond on my earlobe

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Hop in that 'Rari, I drive fast, I'm a a-hole (Skrrt)
I got cashflow, bitch droppin' the ass low
Ride dick like a lasso
40 on me, it's fuego hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and Pluto astronauts

[Verse 1: Future]
Alien, I'm not a regular guy
Emilio Pucci, not regular fly
It's been a year since I went in the mall
I'm not a regular guy
We put them beams on a semi, you better be ready to die
I got on wings like a Bentley, I feel way too high
Left the sticker on the window still got the paper tag
Louis Vuitton bandana, too many shopping bags
Richard Mille or the Rollie, it don't tick tock
Hermes bandana just like 2Pac
My little brother, he a scammer, ride with 2 choppas
We want ecstasy and codeine, we don't detox

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Balenciagas on my feet, these ain't no Reeboks
I grew up a bad kid, coulda been on The Boondocks
I keep my hand on my tool, ahh
Clip look like a ruler
I roll with them shooters, shooters
Ain't with the talking, we just do it
Stripper bitch, big ol' booty
Your ho dirty, she got cooties
Big ol' 30, and it'll do you
Uh, I shoot that shit like a movie
White bitch nerdy, her name Susie, uh
The bitch head game go stupid, uh
Birkin bag on my back hold the Uzi, uh
Two Percs to the face, I'm booted

[Verse 3: Future]
Blood on my hands, blood in my eyes
Codeine in my cup, money on my mind
Gonna take this Percocet and try and see stars
Presently, they askin' young niggas I got bars
Hope you never get to murder solvin' like nothin' wrong
Hope, the day you run into your ops, you get 'em goin'
I be with my Chi town brothers, Al Capone
Me and Juice killin these niggas like they got they hands down
Blood in my eyes, blood on my hands
Blood in my cup, blood on my bands
Made a million dollars in abandoned buildings
Drinkin' out the bottle, you abandon my feelings
I took three 10s and went hasta luego
Juice WRLD prolly in that 'Rari actin' a a-hole
I'm with some bartenders, they bad like J-Lo
Keep the cannon like a tummy tuck, pushin' yayo
Blow my head off, she deserve Chanel coco
I got dirty bands, I'm gettin' my El Chapo

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Future]
I drive fast, I'm a a-hole
I got cashflow, bitch droppin' that ass low
Ride dick like a lasso
40 on me, it's fuego hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and Pluto astronauts
I got bands, hasta luego
I got cashflow, bitch droppin' the ass low
Ride that shit like my last ho
Chopper on me, I'm B.G. hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and Juice astronauts
