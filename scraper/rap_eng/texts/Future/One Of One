[Intro: Future]
Got a few different designers on
Casey wassup?
Drinking codeine like PÃ©rignon
Oh, woah, woah

[Chorus: Future]
Gotta take off right now (right now)
You fallin' in love right now (right now)
I just caught my buzz right now (right now)
Don't give up right now, now, now, now, now
Purple drink, so sophisticated
One of one, can't be duplicated
Haters mad, when a nigga made it
Keep it exclusive for me babe (me babe)
As long as they print it, my niggas, they gon' get it, get it, get it
Poppin' the style on bitches, got it forever lady
Keepin' the foreplay anonymous
All of my foreigns, Geronimo
All of my jewels, Geronimo (yeah)
Kinda lit, I've been pourin' it

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
If I had a dollar
For every time, a nigga said he made me
I'd probably be rich (yeah)
Fuck them niggas, man I elevated (fuck them)
Confidential, with them conversations (conversations)
I don't talk, I don't tell no statements (shh)
I fell in love with the money baby (money baby)
Relationship status complicated (complicated)
I know them niggas mad, that we made it (mad)
More money, more problems (more problems)
Percocets got a nigga faded (pull up)
Gave my Momma, a hunnid thousand cash (a hunnid thou')
I ain't even lookin' at my bank statements (nah)
You should have seen, where I come from (come from)
You'll be happy that a nigga made it (made it)
I was low, lower than the pavements (low)
My life, similar to basement (basement)
Now the whips really foreign (foreign)
Now the bitches, can't ignore 'em (ignore 'em)
Now the chain on VVS, diamonds lookin' like its snowin' (snowin')
Flooded Cuban on my wrist (wrist)
Pinky ring, really glowin' (glowin')
Knew them niggas really doubted me (doubted me)
I'm just happy that I showed 'em

[Chorus: Future]
Gotta take off right now (right now)
You fallin' in love right now (right now)
I just caught my buzz right now (right now)
Don't give up right now, now, now, now, now
Purple drink, so sophisticated
One of one, can't be duplicated
Haters mad, when a nigga made it
Keep it exclusive for me babe (me babe)
As long as they printin' my name, they gon' get it, get it, get it
Poppin' the style on bitches, got it forever lady
Keepin' the foreplay anonymous
All of my foreigns, Geronimo
All of my jewellers, Geronimo (yeah)
Kinda lit, I've been pourin' it

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
They say, the money goin' to my head (to my head)
Old friends, tell me that I'm changin' (that I'm changin')
Baby girl, just do me a favor (do me a favor)
Girl, do not treat me like I'm famous (yeah)
I ain't changin', I'm just busy (busy)
Goin' out, city, city (city)
Nigga, seeing different faces (all faces)
That shit fuckin' wit' me (yeah)
If you met the women that I met (that I met)
Maybe, you'll cheat too (I bet)
I just hope, whoever got you next (got you next)
Knows how to treat you (yeah)
I used the money, just to hide my pain (hide my pain)
I ain't ever goin' broke again (nah)
Fallen victim to them Percocets (ooh)
Body numb, I don't feel no pain (body numb, I don't feel no pain)
Momma, told me slow down on chicks (oh yeah)
Baby momma, always catching fits (fits)
Talkin' 'bout, how she need some shit (need some shit)
Too much money, lookin' counterfeit
I miss my son, I can't handle this
Nigga been goin' through some shit

[Chorus: Future]
Gotta take off right now (right now)
You fallin' in love right now (right now)
I just caught my buzz right now (right now)
Don't give up right now, now, now, now, now
Purple drink, so sophisticated
One of one, can't be duplicated
Haters mad, when a nigga made it
Keep it exclusive for me babe (me babe)
As long as they printin' my name, they gon' get it, get it, get it
Poppin' the style on bitches, got it forever lady
Keepin' the foreplay anonymous
All of my foreigns, Geronimo
All of my jewellers, Geronimo (yeah)
Kinda lit, I've been pourin' it

[Outro: Zoey Dollaz & Future]
They say, the money goin' to my head
Old friends, tell me that I'm changin'
Baby girl, just do me a favor
Girl, do not treat me like I'm famous
I ain't changin', I'm just busy
Goin' out, city, city
Nigga, seeing different faces
Kinda lit, I've been pourin' it
Kinda lit, I've been pourin' it
