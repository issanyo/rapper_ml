[Hook: Future]
Bad bitches, yeah, they love a thug
They want a rich nigga selling drugs
Heard a nigga working with a plug
Now she tied to me like a bug
Tell your ho I blow them stacks, nigga
Tell your bitch I blow them stacks, nigga
Tell your ho I blow them stacks, nigga
Yeah, yeah – she know I blow them stacks, nigga

[Verse 1: Casino]
Tell your bitch I’ve got a truckload
Tell your ho I’ve got the streets in a chokehold
Tell your bitch I’ve got all the cash
My ho in the mall grabbing all types of bags
If you tell her something, make sure you tell her this:
Casino stay down and he driving foreign whips
I’ve got a hustle the same size as … mall
My brother criss so big make it look like Atlantic mall
Tell your ho that, if you tell her something
Tell her money piling, if you tell her something
All the bitches love me ’cause I’m selling something
And I’m a motherfucking boss and I ain’t telling nothing

[Verse 2: Future]
A nigga all straight – I’ve got plugs on plugs
Got a lot of cake – all my niggas selling drugs
Say you wanna bail? We gong kill you if you tell
Selling fish scale, gotta shoot it out with twelve
Niggas on the line – got these bitches selling pussy
They finessing for it, and they and they bring ‘em back to cook
This ain’t Warsaw – bought a thousand and one grams
If you whip it right, you can pull up in a Lam’
On that lean, nigga – know we serve ‘em by the paint
You wanna live, nigga? Well, you’d better bring your bank
I was grinding way before they sent you, your baby daddy know this
Every time I fucked her with another bitch, she noticed

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 3: Bloody Jay]
All these bad hoes want a Blood
Oops, I mean “bloody” – for them stacks we leave you bloody
We get down and dirty, I mean muddy
Woke up to the A, the home of that red clay
And ain’t shit sweet, so why they call us the Peach Gang?
See, money at a young age, it fucked up my mindstate
Or did it?
It was always trap or die
And I ain’t die, so I guess I did it
We was serving magic rounds
Yeah, anybody can can get it
And it’s all about us, so let’s get it
And it get cold in them streets, so bring your mittens
Casino the ex drug dealer is on in six minutes
Dirty like business…
