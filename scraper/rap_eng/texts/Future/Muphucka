[Hook: Mexico Rann]
They check my résumé – that thing say it's solid
Check my fabric, Chanel and Fendi, all over my body
Ferrari seats ostrich, Forges got that thing squattin’
Gotta keep that thing – I know these niggas watchin
Got that extendo, on that tec, muphucka
Bought a car, got some rims for that muphucka
Copped the spot, put that glass in that muphucka
Just got a house, I paid cash for that muphucka

[Verse 1: Mexico Rann]
We crucial, got that cannon in this muphucka
You tripped up my cameraman in this muphucka
50-round banana clip on that AK
Nigga play, I’m goin’ bananas in this muphucka
Ain’t nothin’ but bad bitches in my VIP, muphucka
That nigga tried that nigga’s mind in that muphucka
That boy a mark, that boy Casino in this muphucka
FreeBandz, yeah, my whole gang in this muphucka
We just threw 20 racks on them hatin’ suckers
I see you talkin’ strong, but we got the muscles
Shooters on file, so I ain’t gotta tustle
And I ain’t gotta say shit, they just know to bust you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
We in the station straight flexin’ in this muphucka
Scooter, how you get that pound in this muphucka?
You know we got them pistols in this muphucka
I shoulda bought the kitchen in this muphucka
Cook so much dope my mama start bitchin’
Turned her Sunday kitchen to a fuckin’ dope business
Black amigo niggas known for water whippin’
We bust them bails down and remixin' pigeons
Check my résumé , I never told nothin’
Whoever your favorite rapper is, he ain’t sold nothin’
Don’t ride Bundts, throw some Forgis on that muphucka
You wanna stretch it? Throw some water on that muphucka
