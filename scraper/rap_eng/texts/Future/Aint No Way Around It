(With The Empire)
[Hook]
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it

[Chorus:]
A bitch gone be a bitch
A hoe gone be a hoe
A killer gone be a killer
That's sumthin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gone be a dealer
A plug gone be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
[Verse 1]
A young, hot thang fucked my bro & gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya
I'm a keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth ain't tryna fuck no hoe tryna know me
Know the fuck my wodie
Already smashed the homie
Half of these b*thches phony
Say they need a lil sum like (???)
Ms.Braxton you action, stop actin'
Just a 'nother sad love song waitin' to happen

[Chorus:]
A bitch gone be a bitch
A hoe gone be a hoe
A killer gone be a killer
That's sumthin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gone be a dealer
A plug gone be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Hook]
A bitch gone be a bitch
A hoe gone be a hoe
A killer gone be a killer
That's sumthin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gone be a dealer
A plug gone be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nun about no fame, he addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang, do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco, get them numbers for the low-low
Bigger the risk, the bigger the check, we watch for po-po
Make sure you keep your eyes on, when you're drivin down 1-0
That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin with Coco
When you got hands like these you can count money with your eyes closed
(???)
Half of these niggas front fo'
Bitches for extra convo
Really plugged in with Migo
Go blind and still can see, no
