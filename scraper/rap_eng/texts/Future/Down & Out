When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, haann
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies, Ahhhh

[FUTURE]

More money more problems, man this shits hilarious
I got baby mama drama, this shit embarrassing
Once you get the fame, it’s consequences that come with it
Sometimes you wanna wake up and just say I’m done with it
You know all these dudes I paid
Now you do the most complaining
Now I made it and I’m famous
Emotionally you drain me
I smoke a pound of that kush
And blow out the stress I’m thinking
I put versace on leather cover me like a blanket
I sip on codeine, I’m sippin it till my body numb
And I get loaded like baby gangster vl shawty
Remember shoppin at linnicks, I let you hold the 40
I’m a superstar and now you wish you can take it from me

When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh

[French Montana]

Getting high, drinking, smoking, rolling up the purple
And I swear to god it'll hurt me more to hurt you
Grinding, hustling we ain't never take no nights off
Money came flipping, switching, tryna cut my lights off
Fight and make up, shoes, 1000 on the make-up
Pouring drank, to hold me down like an ankle
Tunnel vision on that money, fuck that talk
In the club, twisting fingers, getting twisted
Off that dark, water
We was down and out, we had to plan it out
Me and shawty getting ghost, spoil the phantom out
Quarter million on the car, silk medusa sheets
Before I made a dollar, I was lying to the streets

[Hook]
When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh
