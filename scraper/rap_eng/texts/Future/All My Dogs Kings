[Intro: Future]
King Pluto

[Chorus: Future]
All of my dogs kings, all of my dogs kings
All of my dogs kings, all of my dogs kings
Keep four bitches at the telly
A pair of Cartiers, don't forget it
I'm on promethazine, I know it's bad
Hit the Gucci store and spaz, I was on my last last
I was running from the drug task, count it up on my iPad
They was already hating on us anyway
We need to straighten that, I'm talking ASAP

[Verse 1: Future]
Told you I'd never fall asleep on you cause I know we some vultures
Told you I'd never turn my back on you, we gettin' loaded
Big old Glock with the beam, big old truck with the wing
Big old set for the team, big old percs with the lean
Hundred, shooters, no, poppin'
Foreign, coupe, pink, molly
Percocets, narcotics
Murder, sex, money, violence

[Chorus: Future]
Hit the Gucci store and spaz, I was on my last last
I was running from the drug task
A pair of Cartiers, don't forget it
I'm on promethazine, I know it's bad
Hit the Gucci store and spaz, I was on my last last
I was running from the drug task, count it up on my iPad
They was already hating on us anyway
We need to straighten that, I'm talking ASAP

[Verse 2: FBG Wookie]
We goin' small, hey, feelin' like Yao Ming
Drippin' by all means, pour up an eight, I'm on tall, lean
You fill my cup, I can't sip it
Wookie geeked up, he keep sippin'
Wookie geeked up, he keep trippin'
All of these drugs they keep missin'
Hundred, thousand, all, cash
Young nigga, life real fast
Me and my niggas so close, you can't tell us apart

[Chorus: Future]
All of my dogs kings, all of my dogs kings
All of my dogs kings, all of my dogs kings
Keep four bitches at the telly
I'm on promethazine, I know it's bad
