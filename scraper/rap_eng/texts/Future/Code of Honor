[Skit: DJ ESCO]
Another day in my life, huh
I'm proud of myself, this the longest I've ever kept a job
I don't care if it is workin' at the gas station
'Cause in two months, I get my first raise
This owner, Ali, always tryin' me though
Oh my God!
When he told me I gotta work overtime today, knowin' I'm goin' to my boy's barbeque
I knew this was gonna be my last day
At this point, I ain't even got nothin' to say
Bruh... shit... man, look here, I got places to go and people to see
Keep that 30 cent raise! I'm gone
Man I swear I need my own show
My life is like a movie

[Intro: Future & DJ ESCO]
Super, this for the gang, oh
Is that your Rollie, man, is that your Rollie? DJ EscoMoeCity

[Chorus: Future]
Spark up the dodie, then you check your Rollie (check me out)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
I wanna sack the baddest
I wanna know you the baddest (baddest)
I wanna know if you're tatted (tatted)
I wanna know if you're ridin' (ridin')
Creep on the low like assassins ('sassins)
Take trips you'd never'd imagined ('magined)
In a whip you'd never'd imagined (check me out)
Who said we'd never be gunnas?
Live by the code of honor (code of honor)
Who said they're ready to purchase?
Who ready to snatch up a Phantom? (Snatch up a Phantom)

[Verse 1: Future]
Who really ready to do it?
Who ready to set some standards? (Set some standards)
You lil' niggas nothin' but some cowards
Lil' niggas nothin' but some feathers (nope, nothin' but some feathers)
I see stars in ceilings, I see scars on villains (scars on villains)
I ain't got no feelings, I ain't got no feelings (got no feelings, swear)
Tell me you been in that bag, tell me you been in that Jag (been in that Jag)
Tell me you been on the pineapple Fanta, stackin' your cash (stackin' your cash)
Golden plate medallions, golden plate medallions (plate medallions)
I relocate where the stash at, hope you can imagine (check me out)
I can walk on water, fly away ('way, woo)
I can go to places it ain't safe (safe, let's go)
I see stars in ceilings, I see scars on villains (scars on villains)
I see youngin' loaded, dodgin' penitentiary (penitentiary, woo)
I stay representin', highly recommended (recommended)
When I hit you with the truth, don't you get offended (get offended)
Don't you slow me down, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll)
Don't you fuck around and sell your soul (Super, Super)

[Chorus: Future]
Spark up the dodie, then you check your Rollie (check me out)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
I wanna sack the baddest
I wanna know you the baddest (baddest)
I wanna know if you're tatted (tatted)
I wanna know if you're ridin' (ridin')
Creep on the low like assassins ('sassins)
Take trips you'd never'd imagined ('magined)
In a whip you'd never'd imagined (check me out)
Who said we'd never be gunnas?
Live by the code of honor (code of honor)
Who said they're ready to purchase?
Who ready to snatch up a Phantom?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, yo
Tell me who do it like Groovy, nigga, my life is a movie (movie, yeah)
Wifin' that bitch, you a foolie, nigga, that ho got the cooties (cooties, yeah)
Make a deposit (make a deposit), jump in the rocket (jump in the rocket)
Too many options (too many options), so many options (so many options)
Nigga we poppin' (poppin', uh), coppin' and swervin' (swerve, swervin')
Nigga, we servin' (servin', yeah), send you a car (send you a car)
Rip it in half, jump in the ho, go (ho, go)

Nigga, my bread Jumanji, more than your average, oh (average, oh)
Check out the Rollie, wrist, swish, classic, oh (classic, oh)
I jump in the Porsche, put ped' on the ground
I show out a bag, she move it around
Rockin' the best, go on the mound
Scatter of a K, go in the house
Get in the way, doin' you first
The bigger the ass, the bigger the purse
Show me the mask, show me the work
Doin' the most, too many O's
Money won't fold, a million in rolls
Too many hoes, too many flows
Rockin' the face, I'm really the GOAT
They jump on the wave, I jump in the Ghost

[Chorus: Future]
Spark up the dodie, then you check your Rollie (check me out)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
I wanna sack the baddest
I wanna know you the baddest (baddest)
I wanna know if you're tatted (tatted)
I wanna know if you're ridin' (ridin')
Creep on the low like assassins ('sassins)
Take trips you'd never'd imagined ('magined)
In a whip you'd never'd imagined (check me out)
Who said we'd never be gunnas?
Live by the code of honor (code of honor)
Who said they're ready to purchase?
Who ready to snatch up a Phantom? (Snatch up a Phantom)
