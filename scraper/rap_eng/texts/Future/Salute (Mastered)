[Intro]
Yeah, ey
For real, for real
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

[Hook]
I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

[Bridge]
I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grind been payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil shawty be popping them Xans off
Lil mama, she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now

[Verse 1]
My lil ride it bloody to [?], I told a young nigga to stand down
Pineapple phantom, Promethazine on me, get loaded
I told you I'm ready to get it, my nigga, I'm focused
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
Bitches can't hold me, I'm juiced up with shorty
I'm whipping the 'Rari, or the new Maserati
Bust a jug in the West End at the parking lot
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot
Styrofoam cups, all I know is I get crazy mail
My partners on dust, they gon' shoot up a whole stadium
I don't trust your baby mama but we made a crazy film
And I smashed her last night on a lot of pills

[Hook]
I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

[Verse 2]
No mercy, no manners, no glory, no story, I'm very important
Protect the sources, I was dippin' the fork, I could jump in the Porsche
When I jumped off the porch, I was selling that crack like that shit was a sport
I was running through bushes, jumping over fences, I gotta get 'way from them narcs
Hey, man I can never get 'way from this art
They treat you like Lord, they treat you like God when you beat the odds
None of my dreams was reality just a few years ago, homie was starvin'
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie
I feel the weight on your shoulders, I need to blaze up the doja
You need to blaze up the doja, I gotta keep my composure
I gotta keep on goin', come and lay with you early in the mornin'
And when the sun rise, I know it's killing you
I ain't down with you no more
You done caught feelings, you can't take it no more
Me coming through, smashing, leaving right back out the door
I could tell it's somebody else you spending your time with
I'm just tryna find me somebody else I can grind with
You want me acting like a nigga on some nine to five shit
Ain't tryna treat you like no side bitch, but you my bitch
Diamonds on your ankle, baby, whoa
I been in the kitchen cooking all night

[Bridge]
I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grind been payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil shawty be popping them Xans off
Lil mama, she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now
