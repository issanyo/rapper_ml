[Intro: Future]
We ain’t trippin’ on none of you clowns (not at all)
Freeband Gang, we good
Yeah… turn up!
Never turn down, aye…

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 1: Future]
Sippin’ on my sizzurp, shinin’ in my blizing
What up to my lil’ mama, and I salute my main thing
I get paper fast, quick, fast lane, no roof
I’m higher than a space cadet, airplane, no Coupe
And I’m drinkin’ raw, raw lean – good juice
And I rep Lil’ Mexico for real – we gon’ shoot
And I got a stable full of bitches, feed ‘em horse food
And her booty real, real fat – she Toulouse
We inside the VIP on drugs, and good drank
And I’ve got them racks on me now, I’m the bank
She want the red bottoms on her feet, she choosin’
We wanna fuck a Freeband nigga, we ain’t losin’

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
LA Reid signed Future – he good
Future signed me – I’m good
Now they know my name around the world
In every hood – for rappin’ ‘bout jewels
Got a stomach full of Freebandz – I’m full
I’m good, I’m off the moves I pull
Plus I’m a street pharmacist, supply all the drugs
Meetin’ at the round table, money with plugs
Got a million-dollar company, Freeband major
When you got this much money, man, it come with haters
Every night, me and my bitch, we count up the paper
I’m good, I done beat all my cases

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 3: Future]
I don’t know where I’m at, I’m in Saint-Tropez
Money take you places, I’m talkin’ far away
I make another movie, I’mma win an Oscar
The way my niggas movin’, won’t need no imposters
We too deep in the game to ever fuck with lames
I’m an astronaut for real, and we are not the same
We ran through plenty bitches, experienced hard times
We grind so fuckin’ hard, and put it all behind
I went to NASA, I’m Super Future now
They shoot a chopper, ‘bout the Future, talkin’ hundred rounds
I’m on my Black Amigo shit, I need a thousand pounds
You wanna triple up your money, send it out of town

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…
