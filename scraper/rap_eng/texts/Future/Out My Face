[Pre-Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Paparazzi tryna take pics, tell the 4 get the fuck out my face
I don't fuck with 12 cause I heard they were listenin' to a nigga's conversations
I fucked that nigga's bitch, mane trippin', better tell him get the fuck out my face
I got it tucked in my jeans, and I got my nigga Thug with me
And he gon' tell you get the fuck out my face

[Hook: Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan]
Boy get the fuck out my face
Y'all get the fuck out my face
Please get the fuck out my face
Someone get him out my face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
Bitch get the fuck out my face

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hundreds stashed in Robin's, I won't tell nobody
I won't touch your body, ass soft as jelly
I'm the real Tony Montana
I got 50 naked bitches on the banana boat
Luxury, sunny, Young Thugger need loc's
My water heavy, I need me a float
He got them birds in a fender bender
Thugger let your bitch suck him up in rentals
Call me with the deal like a fuckin' pickle
I just went platinum like a fuckin' nickel
How you think I wasn't gon' go?
How the fuck you feel I ain't gon?
Everything I say, I stand up to it
Nigga count ill like he fuckin' Jewish
I can't read substituted rights
Get the fuck out my face or else we fight
I hate that we the next superstars boy
If you don't know why, tell 'em Quan

[Verse 2: Future]
What it do, fool?
Freeband gang, you know what we do
Future Billie Jean reincarted
These bitches fascinated, with my conversation, my lingo
Get a load of me, have you hallucinatin'
I'm hypnotizin' ladies
I got 'em in the Matrix
Fresh out the yam spot, gon' pull the Lam' out
Gon' pull your cam out, never blend in
Cause I always stand out, when I came out
Brought a swag out, and some bands out
Them two cups are dirty, my necklace on a birdy
And I ball before the Hall of Fame, James Worthy
And I'm drinkin' on Magic, yellow purple
You can have a sip, if you get dirty
