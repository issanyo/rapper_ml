[Chorus]
Who said you can't be yourself?
Why you afraid of yourself?
Who said you can't be yourself?
Why you afraid of yourself?
FreeBandz!

[Verse 1: Future]
Too much makeup in the mirror, girl
You been at it all day
We done toured with em, we done talked to em, and they all gang
Trap King, I been nominated to the Hall of Fame
Expensive cannon in my Spanish pool, we got the same name
Gotta top me off in the Valet, suck it sideways
Her momma left her in the bando at a young age
She have thoughts of [?] group homes, she like to runaway
I know you hate to be told what to do cause you self-made

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Future]
Who said you can't be yourself?
Why you afraid of yourself?
Who said you can't be yourself?
Why you afraid of yourself? (FreeBandz!)
Who said you can't be yourself? (Ooh)
Why you afraid of yourself? (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Future]
Penetration, can you take it? (FreeBandz)
Too much money in the closet, girl I gotta switch safes
Take some tails on me to the flight, girl I gotta switch planes
I seen a triple homi', they was in the wrong place
I ain't giving up on you, but we gotta take a break
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot, I'm on acid
I was raised up in the [?], you ain't no catfish
I need a prenup if you the wifey
I know your true love is making money

Why you afraid of yourself? (FreeBandz!)
Who said you can't be yourself? (Ooh)
Why you afraid of yourself? (Ooh)
