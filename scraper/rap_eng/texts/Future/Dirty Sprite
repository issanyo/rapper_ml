[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time "that drink will kill you"

[Verse 1]
One, Two cups keep my ice cool
Three or four zips have me leaning like a fool
Purple Sprite on top of ice
I'm rocking ice on dirty sprite
I feel real nice to be precise my jewelry on, high as a kite
I'm space cadet
I drink a check
I spit a Check
Got much respect for Pimp C bitch
Hold my bitch, my bitch say 'why I'm on purple shit'
My purple stuff stay in my cup
Got drank on me I pour me up
Texas oil got me spoiled
Red and Yellow I'm leaning hard

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"

[Verse 2]
I wake up leaning from last night
I drink my lean for breakfast
I'm on that Waffle House cup
RIP to Chad Butler
I got my favorite drink with me it taste just like some kool-aid
Pour me up a 3 or 4 gone have me leaning side ways
Well listen cold with screw up kit we be leaning always
Drinking all day, drinking tall cups I don't give a fuck
Im trued up With two cups
They shook up with dirty sprite
Promethazine can't get enough
Till I O.D you know whats up

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"

[Verse 3]
I'm moving slow the lights ain't bright as they supposed to be
My eyes heavy see what happens when you fuck with me
I think I lost my heartbeat for a second and a half
I'm on that Easter pink-flavored Sprite dirty flag
My ice in my cup filled up to the brim
Drink university even the teacher was a pimp
Church tabernacle drinking coffee like a pastor
Two cups filled with lean, we some dirty sprite bastards

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"
