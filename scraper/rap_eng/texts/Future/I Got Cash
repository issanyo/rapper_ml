(Bridge: Yamine)
Dollar after dollar
Ain’t no way I’m going broke
Hunnid after hunnid
Ain’t no way I’m a joke
Keep fucking with my money
You gone get me provoked
Yeah bro

(Hook)
I got that cash (repeat8xs)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
People say I’m hustlin
And I’m bustin
I won’t stop because I’m struggling
Fuck you mean? she gonna bust it
And shove it
She got shows after shows
Poles after poles
Every single day there’s money drippin on the floor
She used to be broke
Now she’s a millionaire
Brooklyn make me Billionaire
All this cash I’ll throw in the air
Fuck the shadey
Them haters don’t care
I’ll live in the hood but not on well fare
I fund the government because that’s how rich I am

(Bridge: Yamine)
Dollar after dollar
Ain’t no way I’m going broke
Hunnid after hunnid
Ain’t no way I’m a joke
Keep fucking with my money
You gone get me provoked
Yeah bro

(Hook: Yamine)
I got that cash (repeat8xs)

(Verse 2: Future)
I fuck up em commas
Thousands for llamas
They looking for Houston
I go in and call em
You know I be stalling
Designer be stalking
Ooooh
Saving the cash for my goon
I keep shooters with me till the full moon
I keep my dreadlocked cuz they knw a nigga will shoo-oot
You know that I’m ballin and I’m the truth
I know that I’m going to call on you you you
You better go dunkin, and hiding
Fucking with me and I’m gonna get violent
Mess with my money, then your shirt will be violet
