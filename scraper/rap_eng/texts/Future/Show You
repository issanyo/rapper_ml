[Chorus: Future & Tyga]
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out)
Got some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uhh, that pussy mine, that's anytime
And I get it in when I call she said "couldn't pick a better time"
I know is early, just get back in town
I'mma be there in a minute down, drop that towel and its going down
Pull up on your block, all the neighbors watch
Little things, tell you you're pretty, know you get that a lot
Eyes from a distance, his and hers, gold watch
Everybody seen you, with them now them heels, sold out
I invest that time, I respect your grind
Don't keep each other in the dark,cause the sun won't shine
Don't wanna rush it right, but that ass fine
But for now let's just vibe, cause

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out)
Got some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I see you working on your body, getting ready for summer
I just gotta new phone, and I lost your number
But I'mma get it, cause it's that important
Had to hit up your so called 'friends', man, them bitches annoying
I'm on the road, tell me what you're doing
I got that O-love for you, don't let it ruin
How about you come see LA, like a Bruin
Focus on on what we got going, not what everybody else doing
Friday, friday, party like its your birthday
They on the same thing and we changed up, they thirsty
Drop the top, California never rains
I feel your love and pain is crazy babe, cause

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out)
Got some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)

[Bridge: Future]
It's like you up and walked into my life, out of no where (where you come from?)
And if I lie to you today girl, that wouldn't be fair
I wanna take you around the globe and show you off everywhere (Freebandz)
And eventually I want us to take you down
Yea, yea

[Chorus: Future & Tyga]
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out)
Got some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)
I'm just now getting to know you (yeah, yeah)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out)
Got some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
There are some things I wanna show you (show you off, show you off)
Got a lot I want to tell you (no doubt, no doubt)
Me so scared of failure (don't wanna let it all out, yeah)
