[Intro: Future]
Too much poppin' in my life baby, I just really need some time baby
Come and check up on my line baby, out of time baby, ah noo
Fell in love with the lifestyle, black shades, night clout
She want to fuck but she don't love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle
Strapped up but I'm iced down, all white crib with the black towel
She don't want to love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle

[Hook: Future & (YG)]
Oo oo oo oo ooh
You never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Ahhh, ahhh, never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Oo oo oo oo ooh
Never really loved me
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle

[Verse 1: Future]
Lil mama fell in love with the lifestyle
Four bad bitches on a white couch
Last night, tried to pipe down
Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet
Serve it on a platter in a red dress
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa
All she want to do is fuckin' hit the beach
Sand from her toes out the Lambo
Hit Turk Caicos for your sandals
30 round clip for the wrong day
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way

[Pre-Hook: Future]
Extra luv, extra luv, extra luv
Extra luv
Lifestyle, lifestyle

[Hook: Future & (YG)]
Oo oo oo oo ooh
You never really loved me
Ahhh, ahhh, never really loved me
Oo oo oo oo ooh
Never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle (Hol' up, hol' up)

[Verse 2: YG]
It's back-back when I come through (back up)
Come through the back when I come through (back up)
Got the bag, that's a fact when I come through
It go brrrrrrrrat when I come through
Mansion in the Hills and my neighbors is so nosy
Only Maybach in Bompton so I'm sliding with the 40
Gotta keep it on me cause I iced out the Rollie
My diamonds on disco and they dancin', hokie pokie
Put my left wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put my right wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put 'em both together, that's 200 on me, ouch
(That's what my lifestyle about)
No, you ain't never loved me, now you want to fuck me
Gotta deal with all this fake shit
Damn I'm so lucky, come here and fuck me girl
I need

[Pre-Hook: Future & (YG)]
