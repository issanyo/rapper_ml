[Intro: Gucci Mane]
If I told you my cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
This the kind a dope that make your uncle sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas barely 30 talkin' 'bout they retirin'
This the type of dope that make a junkie sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas in they 30's talkin' 'bout they retirin'

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It was once said by a J that couldn't quit
Gucci Mane please can I have another hit?
The dope man said cluck I don't give a shit
As long as your girl kneel down and suck my dick
I'm sellin' coke so clean it make a snorter keep a nose bleed
If you don't know the old me, you don't really know me
I'm from Bouldercrest road b, but you can call it blow street
Where junkies buy a 8 ball 'fore they buy some groceries
When you was playin' basketball man, I was playing Pimp C
Pocket full of Stones man, standin' on the front street
It's something on your back, baby it look like a monkey
She can't shake it off man, she keep spendin' money

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
This the kind a dope that make your uncle sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas barely 30 talkin' 'bout they retirin'
This the type of dope that make a junkie sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas in they 30's talkin' 'bout they retirin'

[Verse 2: Future]
Young ass nigga ridin' in a Flying Spur
Young ass niggas out here drinkin' on the syrup
Young ass nigga and he cookin' up the work
Young ass nigga servin' white, T-shirts
Nelson Mandela, Hood Rockefeller
Denzel bezels, take that shit to trial
Zone 6 nigga, rob you for your bricks nigga
Hit a lick nigga, fuck your main bitch nigga
My bitch is Caucasian... I live in Las Vegas
That's just on a weekend...that's just when I'm faded
This one is a Maybach... it's made by Mercedes
I got baby mommas... they drivin' me crazy

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
