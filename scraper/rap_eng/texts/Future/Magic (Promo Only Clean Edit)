Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot
Leavin' Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of magic
The way I make that work -disappear call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot
Leavin' Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of magic
The way I make that work- disappear call magic
Sipping on the purple and yellow drinking magic

While I magic, while I magic, while I magic, while I magic
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot
Leavin' Magic
Sipping on the purple and yellow drinking magic

On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gone make it to magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport (For What?)
The way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport (Smoke up)
$50, 000 on a superstar's attire (Design!)
KE and Young Future bringin' them the fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick you wanna put me on a flyer
'Cuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em forgave me

Two bad bitches wanna fuck me the greatest
Aye Young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'm a do a 180
For the haters I'm a gone 'head & do a 360
Drinkin' on Sprite got lean all day
I'm a Astronaut Nigga better chruch my pimpin'

Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid no such thing as limitation
Flyin' down 20 in the mothafuckin' spaceship
Just left Magic in the mothafuckin' (dayship?)
Two bitches trailin' in a platinum Infiniti
Gotta thing for me, don't wanna sing for me, they like my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Cris Angel
Ion trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from yo past life
You a real (?) no outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walkin' when you walkin'
I used to be fly but now I'm hawkin'
I was an Earthlin' now I'm SiFi
While I, I stay High)
My bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And pull out in that new Porshe
