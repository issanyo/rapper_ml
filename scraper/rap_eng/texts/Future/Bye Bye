Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
I might fuck her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye

[Verse 1]
I was cookin' up an ounce until it dry-dry
I be stackin' up this paper til it dry right
I can tell she had a toe, she gave me side eye
Told that bitch to wait no time to give me five-five
When they give it up this quick, nigga why try?
Got a girl and made her switch, call 'em bi-bi
We just turned and made a flick, you need a sho-ot
Poppin' tags and smokin' kush, that's that la-la
80 on a watch, boy I don't know why-why
I made it out the block where niggas die-die
2000 for some trousers, when I fly, I'm fly
I pour it out the bottle and get sky high

[Hook]
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
I might fuck her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye

[Verse 2]
I'mma let you borrow sauce cause I'm a fly guy
I just fled from the scene in a wide body
Took a pledge, took my team, I'mma die about it
Balmains, depends which ones, they cost a whole thousand
Really think that she the one? Don't bring that ho around me
When you see her out in public, she so shy-shy
When you get her in the bed, she bring that freak out
Custom made every piece, she call me papa
She gave me real nasty mouth, Lady Gaga
She got a real nasty mouth, I won't apologize
She like hoes and I like hoes, I hit the bull's eye
I got a rockin' presidential, that ain't no lie

[Hook]
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
I might fuck her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
