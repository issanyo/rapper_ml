[Hook: Maceo]
Back in this bitch, back in this bitch
Brought my sac in this bitch, sac in this bitch
You know we got the gas bags of the shit
Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit

[Verse: Maceo]
Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit
I grind it up from deuce fare to 36
Feds know me, got the block hot, they watch me
Like Madlock gotta change car but call it flip flop them fake rims
They flip flop, gotta watch em boy, the block hot but but I serve em boy
Fuck niggas making no noise, them broke boys
Back in this bitch nigga straight cooling
Bands on the bitch, we could make a movie
Turn up, that’s all a young nigga know
We do this shit on the regular won’t show out for these hoes
We play smart, we grind hard, we rubber band them bands
If that the back up in the streets let my young nigga run up in them bands
Trap booming

[Hook: Maceo]
Back in this bitch, back in this bitch
Brought my sac in this bitch, sac in this bitch
You know we got the gas bags of the shit
Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit

[Verse 2: Future]
I pull up in a whip, that's a foreign whip
Young nigga getting money never switch
Take a nigga ho make them bitches switch
Audemar Piquet or the president
Presidential Rolly with a lot of diamonds
365 do a lot of grinding
Sell a lot of kush that’s that O-geezy
Drinking on that syrup gotta nigga leaning
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Whipping up that brown call it coca cola
Balmain designer in my new Givenchy
I'm Joaillerie down in Chanel vintage

[Hook: Maceo]
Back in this bitch, back in this bitch
Brought my sac in this bitch, sac in this bitch
You know we got the gas bags of the shit
Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit
