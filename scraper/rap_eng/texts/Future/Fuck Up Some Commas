[Verse 1: Young Queef]
Hit Tyson's every weekend
And I fuck up some commas
20 thousand dollar bank account, just a couple of dollars
I got so much money, my bank accounts got bank accounts
Bank account got so much commas, it don't even say the full amount
I got carpal tunnel from counting money
I'm humping all these girls call me Humpty Dumpty
She ain't your bitch, cause she only fuck me
She eat my dick all day, I swear she always hungry

[Hook 2: Young Queef]
Let's fuck up some commas yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, to be honest with y'all, I have no fucking clue what the fuck Future says in this part of the song
So I'm not gonna try to make some shit up
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just gonna [?]
I don't wanna kill the song
I probably already have killed it cause I'm some shit at rapping
Whatever, fuck it
I'm not gonna try to make some shit up

[Verse 2: Young Queef]
My pockets always fat, I gotta go on a diet
Money always in my pockets cause I'm always buying
Money always in my hands I got a green thumb
Money always in my hands I never clean them
Smoking weed always in a 100 dollar bill
Burning two types of green, damn, that's my favorite smell
I got so much money, credit card ain't got no limit
Cash flowing like the Nile cause I'm always spending

[Hook 3: Young Queef]
Like I said earlier, I can't really understand Future
So yeah, I'm just gonna wait until I start rapping again
Which is now

[Verse 3:]
I got so much cash, I got endless bankroll
You ain't got no cash, you got endless bankrupt
I got money just for weed, that's a dank account
You ain't got no cash, that's a blank account

[Outro]
Yeah there we go
Young Queef and Future
See I'm on the come-up
Queef nation nigga
