{Hook: De' Fresh}



From the bottom

I rise to the top yea

I'm gone make it

Gotta make it, i'm gone make it

To the top yea, I'm gonna make it



{Verse: De' Fresh}



I recall them old days, when I used to have nothing always broke as a joke

At the age of thirteen getting pulled by the yoke

The yoke of the devil, was pulling me in, tryna make me believe

So I took off on a mission to the holy place and have them pray for me

Pray for me, and tell the lord to have a little mercy upon me

Cause I didn't mean to do them

All the things in the past, I didn't mean to do them

I just wanted something better for myself and my family

On a mission everyday tryna find the best of me

While I break up with the past and break up with the friendemies

Cause they've never done a thing for me

When I was down and out, they've never trusted me

They've always had a doubt, so I've realized

I got to make it, got to make it at the age of 17

With something on my table I could call mine when I'm 18

From the bottom

I rise to the top yea

I'm gone make it

Gotta make it, i'm gone make it

To the top yea, I'm gonna make it



{Verse: The Future}



I'm looking for answers, I don't even know the questions

Homie stressing, from all the weight this world is pressing on me

You can't relate, we all feel depression

Don't we blood sweat and tears

Is just a small part of my testimony (chea)

God just want to test me don't it

If you fake it till you make it, then your success is phony

I know he loves me, even though he never told me (I missed you dad)

Instead he showed me that this world was a steady pressure on me

Back to the wall got my head to the sky

Got my feet on the ground and this red in my eyes

My eyes seen, too much to clear with visine

I'm just tryna leave a life, that I've seen my dreams

I fiend for this microphone, like I gotta hold it close

Spit dope till you overdose, leave folks comatose

No there goes, off the head when i'm on my own, I hold my own

My mama usually tells me, boy you know that you're a rolling stone




{Hook: De' Fresh}


From the bottom

I rise to the top yea

I'm gone make it

Gotta make it, i'm gone make it

To the top yea, I'm gonna make it
