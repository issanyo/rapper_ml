[Intro: Future]
Me and lil' mama, we exchange the fuck faces
Pour the brown liquor up, made me go brazy
Coolin' you down, you makin' me win

[Bridge: Future]
Me and lil' mama, we exchange the fuck faces
Pour the brown liquor up, made me go brazy
Jump in the Benz, turnin' all 10
Coolin' you down, you makin' me win
Took her to Chanel, she lost her mind, went crazy
Introduced her to the real diamonds, no fugazy

[Verse 1: Future]
Chrome heart, clip, frame, that's when you know you made it
Only way you drive it, if it's turbo, baby
I get NBA money, KD
I can go 100 rounds, nigga, don't play me
Designer all the way down, bitch, slay me
Automatic drip, AK me
Baddie, baddie
Badder than Janet Jackson
Feed ya racks, what ya expect?
Got Stella McCartney, down your back
Grey Poupon, thanks to the connect
Canary stones all on your neck
Tough man 'til morning, give me respect
Bendin' it over, girl, I'm obsessed
Keepin' me focused, I'm impressed

[Chorus: Future]
Wipin' off your Louie V, bitch
Hermès on your feet, bitch
Dior on your sleeve, bitch
Red wine when you sleep, bitch
Wipin' off your Louie V, bitch
Hermès on your feet, bitch
Dior on your sleeve, bitch
Red wine when you sleep

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm a motherfuckin' king, what you expect?
Yeah, my Prada fanny pack is a pet
Get the bust down Patek like you Barti
I'ma spoil you like a brat, you a Barbie
Hermès on my elbows down to my knees, bitch
Look down at your stilettos, double C's, bitch
Drivin' a big B with the wings on your seat, bitch
Wanna be down on my team, can't be a weak bitch
Gotta tell me all your secrets, can't be sneaky, bitch
If you shy, drink tequila and get freaky, bitch
We woke up in the sky, G60
'Fore you tell me a lie, we could fix this
Found too many diamonds to get seasick
Presidentials for my daughters and my nieces
Treated you just like family, that's how I keep it
I'm a man of my word, meet me at the Four Seasons
Stamp your passport up, I pledge allegiance
Get your Visa paid for if it's needed
I can't see your ex-nigga, ain't no reason
We all learn and we live and it's needed

[Chorus]
Wipin' off your Louie V, bitch
Hermès on your feet, bitch
Dior on your sleeve, bitch
Red wine when you sleep, bitch

[Outro]
Me and lil' mama, we exchange the fuck faces
Pour the brown liquor up, made me go brazy
