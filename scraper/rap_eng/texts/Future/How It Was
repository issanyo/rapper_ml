[Spoken intro]
This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothing this great
We went through, the motherfuckin' unbelievable

[Hook: Future]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 1: Future]
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission
It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

[Hook: Future]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

[Hook: Future]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 3: Future]
Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

[Hook]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was

And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was

How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was
