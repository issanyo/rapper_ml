[Verse 1: Rihanna (Future)]
Shoppin' in Paris
We gon’ go shoppin' in Paris, nigga (in Paris, nigga)
They can't even compare us
They can’t even compare us, we're rarer than niggas
Rarer than niggas
I never'd 'magine that shit comin'
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds (drownin’ in hundreds)
Ayy, I keep a duffle bag on me like Tity Boi and Dolla (duffle bag, duffle bag)
Bruh, we ain’t takin' that weed, oh no
And if they don’t love me, fuck whatcha talkin' 'bout (fuck whatcha talkin' ’bout)
I'm in love with the cash, I put that on my mama and father

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 2: Future]
Go to Australia
Leave for Dubai, we go to Australia
They gotta pay us
Just to come visit, they gotta pay us nigga
Wakin' up everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Makin' a film
These niggas be raggin' my shit, that they doin
Honestly I never see 'em
I keep cash money on me like Birdman still
You might catch me in the whip and it cost me a mil'
With the chop on see like a nigga in the field
While ya'll countin these hundreds, I'm hollin' at tills (??)

[Chorus 2: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it
Ain't none of this promised, ain't none of this promised (nope, no no)
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed, put that on my mama (I put that on my mama)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this certain, not even one of us perfect (yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (woo)
Ain't none of this promised (turn up)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this shit, none of this shit, none of this
Ain't none of it promised

[Bridge: Rihanna]
I love you, money, I love you, money
I'ma never put a nigga above this money
I'ma wake up and just hug this money
Yeah, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]
