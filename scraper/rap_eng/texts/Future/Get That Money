[Hook: Future]
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah

Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, yeah, shit got hot

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I get that money
I sell everything that money can buy
I get it poppin' like 4th of July
We bring the noise, these niggas get quiet
I wipe the tears from my momma eye
We ain't never go sleep back outside
Remember we used to go ask for a ride
Now we decide on which one to drive
I get that bread by the loaf
Play with the bread and get toast
I get them bricks out the boat
Them bitches cleaner than soap
I told my niggas to 'don't never lose hope
We ain't never falling out like no hoe
Remember we used to go sleep on the floor
Now we go places that they can not go
I'm in the Bluff,  telling them people don't come in to bluff
None of them falsehoods not wanted with us
They had to call up the army for us
I just gave all of my bitches some money
They gon' fuck me whenever I'm horny
I bought my niggas everything they wanted
They done gave the real young nigga money
Ralo!

[Hook: Future]
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, nigga, shit got hot
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, yeah, shit got hot

[Verse 2: Future]
I got that dog food on me
I got a few of them chains on me
My lil nigga sittin' in the passenger seat with the chopper
Just laying on you
Used to sleep on the floor I'm the man now
On some molly, some drank and some xans now
Ain't no talking, no talking, they spraying now
I was fucking that hoe but one laying now
Come through, smash on the later, I went staying there
Used to sleep by the door with the fan down
I drank me a four out of a can now
I'm so high of this dope and I'm staying now
Hit the blow, in my coat I was staying there
Got that drank on me, nigga and its staying here
Got the national guard and the blunt for my lil brother Ralo, that nigga the man now
I just bought me a new 'Rari, that money machine, it sound just like a fan now
I told my niggas, we hustle, we stay down for all of the this, don't want hand outs
Niggas be walking around with them tools, strapped up [?] them bands now
Bitches and niggas be barking up, sapping up
Bitches ain't nothing but some fans now

[Hook: Future]
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, nigga, shit got hot
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, yeah, shit got hot
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
I get it popping
I get that money, that money, that money, oh yeah
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, nigga, shit got hot
Had to change up spot, had to change up spot, yeah, shit got hot

[Outro: Future]
