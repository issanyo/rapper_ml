[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Anytime I'm alone, I can't help thinking about you
All I want, all I need, all I see is just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Katy Perry]
Oh, he give it to me
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
Oh, he give it to me
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Katy Perry]
Anytime, anywhere, baby boy, I can misbehave
Make it like your birthday every day
Breathe me in, breathe me out, feel me, I'm
Running through your veins
Give you something good to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Future]
Oh, he give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
He give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
Oh, he give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
He give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Future]
He make me go....
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Everyday, every
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Everyday, every

[Verse 3: Future]
I put that work on you everyday
When the night fall 'til the sun come up
You done fell in love with a bad guy
I don't compromise my passion
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be trippin' or makin' mistakes
I made too many in my past (that's right)
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage lovin' on you
Baby, like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby, rotate it

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Future]
Oh, he give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
He give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
Oh, he give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every
He give it to me
Everyday, everyday, everyday, every

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Future]
He make me go....
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Everyday, every
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Everyday, every

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Future]
Give it to me, to me
(She got me on it...)
Oh, he give it to me every day
(She got me on it...)
