[Intro: Future]
You know I just bought another shovel
This year we buried a lot of bags, you dig?
Wheezy Beats

[Chorus: Future]
All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
Yeah (What you doin'?), I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (Facts)
I take your ho then pimp her (Pimp her)
I make it look that simple (Simple)
Swervin' this Bent' like a rental (Whoa)

[Verse 1: Future]
I keep a horse on the emblem (Yeah)
I got them racks in my denim (Yeah)
I let my dog out the kennel (Swear)
Patek, a Philippe on my drip (Drank)
Yeah, yeah, and she don't want me to sip (Pour up, pour up)
It's too much jealousy, niggas can't never be real (Can't)
I caught a felony, nigga, wasn't none of you here (Hold on)
I work every day at this sh-, like it can all disappear (Swear)
I pray every day 'bout this sh-, when I go jump on a Leer (Super)
God protect me from all of the bogus and niggas who roguish
Yeah, water me down like Pacific, my watch and my chain, my rings
Yeah, all this drip on me, I had to go change my name (Yeah)
I came from Lil Mexico, this shit ain't gon' never be the same (Freebandz)
I fuck her on the every day, but she ain't gon' never get claimed

[Chorus: Future]
All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
Yeah (What you doin'?), I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (Facts)
I take your ho then pimp her (Pimp her)
I make it look that simple (Simple)
Swervin' this Bent' like a rental

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm whippin' the Rover out (Skrrt)
I got a plastic FN, a lil' under four pounds (whoa, whoa)
I send a jet to Miami to pick up the Zoe pounds (Zoes, get it)
My bro got the Shawty Lo on repeat while he rollin' 'round (Got on repeat, RIP Lo)
I'm doin' the same thing (You dig)
Lickin' molly like remains (RIP)
Getting head ona private plane
It cost me 23 thou' like LeBron James (LeBron James)
Might put me some gators on
Then get in the 'Lac and just blow the brains (blow the brains)
I fuck on her face
I came fast like when Sonic came (Oh, oh)
Get on my level, dawg
I just want some racks, I'm just tryna ball (Just tryna ball)
I spent a couple milli' (Yeah), on my nigga behind the wall (The chain gang)
I teach him, the feds come (The bang gang)
Don't say nothin' at all (Don't say nothin' at all)
I got some chips on me (You dig?)
It's on my hip, homie

[Chorus: Future]
All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
Yeah (What you doin'?), I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (Facts)
I take your ho then pimp her (Pimp her)
I make it look that simple (Simple)
Swervin' this Bent' like a rental
