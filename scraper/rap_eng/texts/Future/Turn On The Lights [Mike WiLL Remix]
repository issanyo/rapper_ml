[Future]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves saint Laurent
Used to drive the Nissan, now she in a Beamer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loner
Her old man, the owner
And I don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want bruh
I'm champagne forever
I'm dirty Sprite forever
You can come sit with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, wherever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to this cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights

Turn on the lights

Who know how to maintain
If you wanna win my heart
Don't be in it for the fame

I'm down for whatever
Yeah, you know that I'm a rider
And if he got my back
He know that I'm right there beside him
And if I ever need it, you the one that I be dialing
Ohhhhh
Where you at?

You know
I'mma stay down
Always 'round through the highs, through the lows
Down to ride anyway it goes
You know

Even when I'm far, I'm always near
All you gotta do is

[Pre Hook - Ciara]
Turn on the lights

Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like vroom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi, tell 'em I'm straight

[Future]
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been misled
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams

I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

[Pre-Hook - Future]
