False friendships disgusting
Y'all niggas fake and I'm hustlin'

I'm gettin' money and I love it
You a hatin' nigga, you a cartoon
To a real nigga you is not a goon
Two cups of that good drank
That's codeine, I'm on the moon
I'm sippin' on some sizzurp
My wrist is on a blizzard
My niggas out of blizzard

[Verse 2: J-Ott$]
Can't believe how far that I came
I'm about to make this run in the game
'Bout to be on top of the world
So you can say that you see me now
Treat me with respect and also bow
All these fans look up to me like wow
How'd you get to where you are?
How'd you become such a star?
Ballin' all up in your fancy car
Plus a song with Wiz now you're in the biz yeah yeah
[?]
Stayed in my lane
Worked real hard even through the pain
Plus sweat and tears, through the rain
Only 23, in the game
Kids used to push me down but I always bounced back
Back on track
Came out thinking like a Cadillac
Now you can hate on that, yeah

[Hook: J-Ott$]
Keep them haters under control
'Cause they gone hate when we ball
So I'm gonna give it my all
To keep them under control
'Cause they gone hate when we ball
So I'm gonna give it my all
To keep them under control
To keep them under control

[Verse 3: J-Ott$]
Be real and don't be fake
Some show love and some show hate
But regardless I don't care though
'Cause I smile [?] just to fail though
On the 'Gram 'cause I am the man
And I live my days like life is great
Stay far away from the fake, yeah
Lotta people used to tell me that I should quit
I should sit, I shouldn't be in this game
But once they saw my fame
That's when they called my name
Through the hard times, I made it through the pain
Got- gotta grind harder and get smarter
Work hard and never give up
This life here I gotta live up
'Cause quittin' really is not an option
So if you got somethin' to say move out to Compton, yeah yeah
