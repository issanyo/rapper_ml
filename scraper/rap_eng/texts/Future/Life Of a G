[Intro: Future]
You see, I’m not the average nigga, Scream
I’m an extravagant nigga
These my words

Hood rich, bitch
DJ Scream heavy in the streets, nigga
Scream, Scream, Scream

[Hook 1]
Caught up in these streets, I can’t be safe
I’m paid, put my soul in every line or in the gave grenade
I feel rage, my lil cuz in the cage
The DA say they got a body on him and a witness
I go blank-eyed in the studio and try to fuck up my kidneys, I get ignant
That kush and that drank I had for bean get my spirit uplifted
I take off like a rocket for my niggas who back home sitting in
645 BMWs [?]

DJ Scream, heavy in the streets

[Hook 1]

Hood Rich

[Verse 1: Future]
[?] this good living
I’m paranoid in the streets, because I live it
I’m hungry, and I know it
Cause I done been where you was, that’s why I keep that tool lit
Because if you budge, it’s BOW

[Hook 2 (2x)]
Ordinary life of a G
Is ordinary life for me
Middle finger to my enemies
Gotta shake them haters offa your sleeve
By any means you gotta succeed

DJ Scream

[Verse 2: Future]
[?] army camouflage, but don’t [?]
I fuck your broad, take your heart, nigga play your cards
I take the odds and I go hard when niggas them trip the charge
I’m on the phone with Wu, while he in the yard
Every time he hit the line, I pick up every time
I might just sit sack, spin a dime, ease my mind
I’m doing fine, I hit the grind and feel it like I’m blind
‘Cause all I’m seeing niggas all the biggies in your city
A product of my city, the binges, the Bentley
The GT, the Contour, no convo, it's pronto
Your head honcho, Congo gorilla niggas
I’m dressed in all black, I had to kill them niggas

[Hook 2]

Hood Rich

[Hook 2]

It’s DJ Scream

[Outro: DJ Scream]
Oh yeah that’s right
Little Rich and the A1 movement is at it again to bring you another street classic
