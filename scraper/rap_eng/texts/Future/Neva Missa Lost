[Guitar] Xeryus
[Intro]
Who are you again? Why are you in my bed?
You left your self esteem at the door this time
You just had too much of my lean this time
I can tell that you been stallin' me (stallin' me)
I never hold you back

[Chorus]
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
And you know it, and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
Please tell me what it cost
Make me pull this money out the drawer
I whip one to two, I sold one to three
That's why I never took a loss
See, I got many types of flaws
That's why I never miss a loss

[Verse 1]
Is that you, Ms. Sagittarius? Tell me what a Sagittarius do
You only eat vegetarian food, in the backseat of the Maybach
You don't speak English: immigration, promise I won't leave you waiting
Catch a Uber to the dealership, girl you gon' pick up your new registration

[Chorus]
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
And you know it, and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
You know, you know
Yeah, I can never miss a loss
That, that, I can never miss a loss
Whatever you need

[Verse 2]
Made love first before we knew each other
I got you sticky like wet leather
Your pretty body soft as bird feathers
If you bring a friend, I'ma switch hit her
Keep on my lenses, I don't see these niggas
They too busy tryna be niggas
I'm out of reach, over peak, nigga!
Made my first million out the creek, nigga
Purple Addys, no sleep nigga
Take the jet so we can meet quicker
Her ass thick, but my syrup thicker
I'm on it right away

[Chorus]
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
And you know it, and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss (whatever you need)
I can never miss a loss (you know, you know)
You know, you know, you know
I can never miss a loss (whatever you need)

[Bridge]
Uh oh, uh uh uh, whatever you need
Whatever you need, I can never miss a loss
Whatever you need, ohhhhh, I can never miss a loss
Yeah yeah, whatever you need, neeeed
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Outro]
You left your self esteem at the door this time
You just had too much of my lean this time
I can tell you been stallin' me (stallin')
I never hold you...
