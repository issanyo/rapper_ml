[Verse 1: Future]
Sittin' in the back of the Phantom, we rollin' the holy dope
That mulah, that mulah, like me and young Flocka, we fuckin' it up on a Rollie though
Fuckin' it up with my comrades, dirty money for them coppers
I'm fuckin' R&B pussy now, it got a young nigga goin' pop
I'm straight out the gutter like '88, I know the streets like a navigation
My trap doing numbers, they fascinated
Catch me pourin' up my medication
I'm trippin' and fallin', the penthouse
Lost in the ghetto, tryna find a way out (Freebandz)
Lost in the ghetto, tryna find a way out

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
They looking at me for the way out
Drum on that bitch with the K out
Bandanna wrapped 'round my head (You know)
Bandanna wrapped 'round her head (You know)
Shoot at your head, not your legs
Future, let's chop up this bread (Hey)
They fuckin' with you, make they bed (Brick Squad)
He scrambling dope like it's eggs
I'm runnin' a play (You know)
The ball in rotation (Let's go)
You know that I'm shooting
Like I'm on location
I be on that paper like I'm on probation
You lovin' these hoes, the squad in rotation
The squad so amazing, so haters like fuck 'em
You hold 'em and trust 'em, we fuck 'em like fuck 'em
I duck 'em, I duck 'em, 'cause bitches be hunting
I'm blunted, I'm stunted, 'cause I came from nothin'
I done it, I did it, my shooters is with it
I handle my business, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
I made it, I got it, you know that I get it

[Chorus: Future]
Let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's turn up, let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's turn up, let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's smoke some', let's pop some' with all these bitches
Let's pour up on all these bitches
Let's drank some', let's drank some' with all these bitches
Let's turn up on all these bitches (All these bitches)
Let's turn up on all these bitches (All these bitches)
Let's do it, let's do it with all these bitches
Let's turn up on all these bitches
Let's smoke, let's drank with all these bitches
