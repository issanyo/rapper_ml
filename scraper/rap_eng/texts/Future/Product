Like, like, like, like, like a narcotic
And I’m a product of my new community
And I’m a product
Finally made it, these niggas they hatin'
Like a narcotic
And I’m a product of my new community

[Verse 1: Rich the Kid]
Kitchen whippin', cookin' baby
Fuckin' sisters and they twins
Trappy mamma want a Benz
Bought a ‘Rari, scraped the rims

I'm in Guatemala with the plug
Passed out on the drank
Runnin’ up, paid the bank
Callin' my phone for the product
Motorola bands beatin'
Pop a perc, now I’m leanin'
I pull out the Wraith for no reason
I can’t even trust a soul
Whip it, get it out the bowl
Hundred thousand on a [?]
Slang a chopper cause I need it

[Verse 2: Rejjie Snow]
Like a narcotic, I’m servin' your mamma
The homies are handin', I’m reachin' in pockets
I’m baggin' the product and mixin' the logic
You rappers are, ugh, kind of retarded
No time sick, I was cured of infection
Two times spent six years for the sentence
Six years old, three wakes I attended
Footsteps, bloodstained sheets, but the [?]
Keep my thoughts frantic, enough with your antics
Love me a bad bitch
Products I’m handin', back-to-back classic singles
My fabric mixin'
That trap infused with that jazzy chemical feel
Yeah, I’m black as can be
And I’m livin' to die, yeah, the shackles of me
And a million a show, yeah, the blackest'll feast

Like, like, like, like, like a narcotic

[Bridge: Rejjie Snow]
Snow [?] season
She lookin', believe me
She hittin' that pipe and her daughter is cold
And it’s served in the evening
So the babies are screamin', the choirs are here
So I’m here for a reason
(So I’m here for a reason)
