We The Best Music

[Pre-Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
I took the top off the Maybach, I took the top off
Another one
I took the top off the Maybach, I took the top off
I, I took the top off my Maybach, nigga
I took the top off my Maybach
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Future]
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach, oh
I took the top off the Maybach, ah
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah

[Refrain: Future & JAY-Z]
I hear the po-po behind me, woo, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt)
I see the po-po behind me, I ain't gon' stop (skrrt, skrrt)
I see the po-po behind me, rrt, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt)
I dropped the top off the Maybach, fuck these cops (rrt, rrt)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
V12, see ya, 12 (bye)
I do the whole dash with no seatbelt
Screamin', "Free my nigga, Meek Mill"
Niggas can't wheelie in this free world
Meanwhile Georgie Porgie sinnin' and sendin' me threats
Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
Try that shit with a grown man
I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
And hop back in the coupe (woo, woo)
Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit
Save all that woopty woop
Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot
No jewels in this Patek Philippe
It's complicated, three million apiece
Sheesh, that's how we do time
Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
$91,000 for a wine bill
Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill
My whole team ball
Everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
Me and Blue havin' a sing off
That's a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
That's a vintage piece
Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new
I had the 'Bach-bach-bach you know how I do
Two-tone with the powder blue (woo)
Realest shit to come out the stu'
Khaled is valid, every word is true
What these niggas gon' do without us, dude?

[Chorus: Future]
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach, rrt
I, I took the top off my Maybach, nigga
I took the top off my Maybach

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I chopped the top off in Otis
Ridin' 'round town with the FLOTUS
1.5 for the Landaulet
Bey, put these fuckboys on notice (fuckboys on notice)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and JAY
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo! I'm like "hol' up"
Woo! I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Future]
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach (ain't gon' stop)
I took the top off the Maybach (rah)
I took the top off the Maybach (woo, woo)
Ayy, I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch
I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach

[Bridge: Future]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, it's glittery, glittery
Ooh-ooh, it's pricy, pricy
Ooh-ooh, 1.5
Ooh-ooh, I'm hyphy, I'm hyphy

[Refrain: Future]
I hear the po-po behind me, woo, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt)
I see the po-po behind me, rrt, ain't gon' stop (skrrt, skrrt)
I see the po-po behind me, rrt, ain't gon' stop (rrt, skrrt)
I dropped the top off the Maybach, rrt, fuck these cops (rrt, rrt, rrt, rrt)

[Outro: DJ Khaled & Future]
We The Best Music
I took the top off, I took the top off
I took the top off, I took the top off
Roc Nation
I took the top off, I took the top off
I took the top off, I took the top off, ooh-ooh
