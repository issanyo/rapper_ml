[Chorus: Future]
I chopped the top off a hard top
I trick the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Chea, nightrider in the black Rolls, tell 'em I'm trippin'
On top of glass, covered in black, tell 'em I'm tippin'
Losing control, I'm lane to lane, you would swear I was slippin'
Prolly cause I told Edgar to spray 'em til he drippin'
Now paint wet, your bitch wetter
Got diamonds flooding my necklace
Gettin' head shots, I called that murder
Cause they ridin' slow like it's Texas
Got a attitude that don't give a fuck
Above 50 plus when I jet this
Lil test drive, I let her go out
Know I bet you hate that she meet this
I flex and pull these lights out
This mouthpiece I got iced out
I'm tricky bitch I'm racked up
Be damned if I get priced out
This haters ain't gon' say shit
They do, they gon' get wiped out
Do my donuts in broad day
Full speedin' with all my pipes out

[Chorus: Future & Boosie Badazz]
I chopped the top off a hard top
I trick the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get (Uh oh)
I'm tricken every single car I get (Boosie Badazz)
I'm tricken every single car I get

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Gotta have a drop top, Lousiana a hot spot
If it ain't a drop, I send it to Cali and get it chopped
50 heads stay cocked so you can see the razorline
Former d-boy, I remember I used to break them down
Paint wet, ooh kill 'em like that
Boosie ridin' foreign and I paid 400 flat
Four 12's in the back, gotta have a little noise
Four deep on the mollies, we some real Ghetto Boys
In my yard, several cars, send 'em to my es√©
Spray that thang candy but might wreck the whip the next day
Peanut butter inside, covered up in plastic
Stash spots everywhere, ride fly everywhere
Boosie!

[Chorus: Future]
I chopped the top off a hard top
I trick the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Chea, I'm in the hood, bitches yellin' they love me
Get in this coupe, you gon' be naked with body like Buffy
Why everytime I hit the block niggas faces get ugly?
Tell them haters I'm on my game and it ain't nothing above me
I live my money, get reckless
You seen that bitch that I just got
I'm Lil Wayne with no ceilings
Can't cool me down, bitch, I'm too hot
Can't change up I got change up
I got shit locked and they chained up
Bout 20 goons and they aimed up
Bitch, play with me, you get banged up
I'm in this Lambo
Artillery like Rambo
Don't fuck with me, I'm prime time
Don't get your whole show cancelled
Everythang gotta do get tuned in
Tell 'em hoes I'm on now
This whip might do bout 200
Tell 'em hoes I'm gone now

[Chorus: Future]
I chopped the top off a hard top
I trick the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I C
