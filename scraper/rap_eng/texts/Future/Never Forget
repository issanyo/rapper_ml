[Intro]
The streets'll speak for it
Where you standin'? Freeband Gang

[Hook]
I dedicated every damn thing to this
I had to take a loss so I could cherish this shit
Two hundred pounds of kush, I'm tryna sell that shit
My migo said fuck it, he gon' mail the brick
Soon as I get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell them shits
Young Scooter makin' juggs on them bales and shit
And we ain't gotta talk about it, you can tell we rich
Everything we went through? man I can never forget

[Verse 1]
By the time I was seven, my Uncle Wayne was in prison
We used to take a trip once a month and go visit
My Grandma and my Granddad, yeah, they all suspicious
Just say no to drugs, hell nah I ain't listen
And loyalty is everything, don't ever forget it
I keep my gun everywhere I go, I never forget it
"And why your Sprite so pink?" I got Promethazine in it
"Why you drive your car nervous?" I got dope all in it
I custom made a cross from the money I made
I ran through nickel bags of crack I shouldâ€™ve been in 12th grade
I ain't make my auntie's funeral, I ain't never forget it
I know she know I love her and I hope she forgive me

[Hook]
I dedicated every damn thing to this
I had to take a loss so I could cherish this shit
Two hundred pounds of kush, I'm tryna sell that shit
My migo said fuck it, he gon' mail the brick
Soon as I get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell them shits
Young Scooter makin' juggs on them bales and shit
And we ain't gotta talk about it, you can tell we rich
Everything we went through man I can never forget

[Verse 2]
I'm the nigga got your sister on the mollies and shit
You can tell I ain't the same cause I acknowledged the bitch
I'm drankin' on my lean, I swear to God I would quit
My auntie was a fiend, I used to serve her a hit
I'm thankin' God today that she don't smoke it no more
I made so much fuckin' money I put a safe in the floor
We got traps in every hood, I used to serve out the stove
I still own the chopper and the old .44
Stick 'em up, hit 'em up, get it and go
We got bags full of cash that we ready to blow
Hittin' licks every day, nigga go sell dope
Them Jewish lawyers and accountants, that's the life that I know

[Hook]
I dedicated every damn thing to this
I had to take a loss so I could cherish this shit
Two hundred pounds of kush, I'm tryna sell that shit
My migo said fuck it, he gon' mail the brick
Soon as I get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell them shits
Young Scooter makin' juggs on them bales and shit
And we ain't gotta talk about it, you can tell we rich
Everything we went through man I can never forget
