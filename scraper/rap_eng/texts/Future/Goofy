[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Coupe from Italy though
I got two of them Rollies
That mean I'm goin' to Boosie
All that dick ridin', no lyin'
Don't know if they're gangstas or groupies
I can't give a fuck 'bout these niggas
Def ain't textin' these hoes
Sleep with a million in cash
Them my relationship goals
I'm on the phone with a sheik
I'm tryna cop me some gems
I'm in the coupe with a mink
I'm ridin' facto the rims
D.A. know who I am
Galore is I don't give a damn
Open my top like a clam
Bentley as white as them grams

[Chorus: Future]

Only the family involved

Young nigga thought I was trippin'

Young nigga thought I was trippin'
Had to cut it off 'cause you wasn't catching no hundreds
Shit, I bought the goon from Russia
Shit, I bought the goon from Russia
