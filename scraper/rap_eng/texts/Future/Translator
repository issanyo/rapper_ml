[Intro]
Freeband gang
Ayy, 1FB global
Let's get it!

[Chorus]
Five Spanish bitches, they've been callin' all day
I couldn't even pick up, I ain't talked to my translator today
I got tags still on clothes, I've been shoppin' all day (designer)
A thousand came in, we've been workin' all day
Money in the bag, got me countin' all day (racks)
Had a check so big, been at the bank all day (millions)
Bought a pint of lean and I've been drinkin' all day (syrup)
This for my real street niggas gettin' money all day

[Verse]
My bitch, she spoke in a foreign language, I don't even speak
I hired a translator for her, ain't talked to her in a week
I got them earrings on blast, you know that watch is a beast
I go to Fifth's and I spaz, man I'm on lean and E
And I got tags on clothes I bought last year in LV
And I'm designer forever, that's just the dopeboy in me
A thousand P's came in, we 'bout to have us a feast
I'm cashin' out on everything, I want that, what are these?
I'm at the bank with the lawyer, I'm a Freeband warrior (Freeband)
Poppin' seals in Detroit, I pour a four when I pour it (two-toned)
Two twenty racks in my jeans (Pluto), and I can't wait to blow it (I can't wait to blow it)
Been flyin' private on jets (ayy), feelin' very important (let's get it)

[Chorus]
Five Spanish bitches (turn up), they've been callin' all day
I couldn't even pick up, I ain't talked to my translator today
I got tags still on clothes, I've been shoppin' all day (designer)
A thousand came in, we've been workin' all day
Money in the bag, got me countin' all day (racks)
Had a check so big, been at the bank all day (millions)
Bought a pint of lean and I've been drinkin' all day (syrup)
This for my real street niggas gettin' money all day (yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Five Spanish bitches, they've been callin' all day
