[Intro]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day off
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy

[Verse 1]
Fuck poppin' trunk lay the chopper, right on your lap
Fuck all these comments, I was just sellin' crack
I blame the streets for the way I was raised
I cannot sleep with these demons behind me
'Xans, they takin' over all your thoughts
If you get in the way of my plans, I'ma knock you out
I laced my Sunkist with Molly
I fucked that bitch, she in college
I gave her game and bags
Put that world on her tongue, she a swallower

[Bridge]
I got the power of my dollar
You know the power of a dollar
Do you know the power of a dollar?
I know the power of a dollar
(I know the power of a dollar)

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day out
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy

[Verse 2]
I'm absolutely goin' brazy
They try to stop me, I ain't hesitatin' (don't stop)
Unwrap the bag and take this medication
I crumple herb on the application
I put a circuit in Kate like a waitress
She gave me somethin', that's one hell of a facial
I wasn't nervous, I hold it an' sprayed it
I know you bogus, I seen this for days (I know you bogus, fuck)
I'm absolutely gettin' revenge, I absolutely gotta win (yeah)
I'm comin' through in the clutch (yeah)
Burn the money up like a Dutch (Dutch)
VVSs, no cut (woo)
These Gucci flops like chucks (Gucci)
Got that throat from a slut (who?)
Best feelin' in the world (best feelin')
When you come through the hood
Ridin' in a foreign and you got your new girl (whoa)
While you pourin' on syrup

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day out
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy
