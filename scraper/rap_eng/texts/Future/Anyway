You ain’t even believe in me from the beginning
I was tryin to tell you everything that was in front of me
Why you rock your ass at me, why you look away
Tryin to share my dreams with you

Move that booty for me
You didn’t believe in me
And it was hurting me

I put it in I wanted to give you everything that you want
And you stay fussing here you dig every chick that you didn’t want
I even got rid of all of my hoes to be your man
Even bought you Gucci, Louie and Prada, that Chanel purse it don’t matter
You knew what it was every time you threw some one on my name
You knew what I was when I met you girl, it was part of the game
Now you all in a media client
You’re lying hat bullshit I ain’t buying
So girl what you actually implying
Cause let me know that you’re lying
That’s what I get I keep fucking withcha
You, me and you both know the real truth
Freebandz make you do what it do
The crazy shit is that I helped you and believed in you

You ain’t even believe in me from the beginning anyway, anyway
I was tryin to tell you everything that was in front of me
Why you rock your ass at me, why you look away
When I was tryin to share my dreams with you and believe in me
You didn’t believe in me
You didn’t believe in me
You didn’t believe in me, believe in me
And it was hurting me
Why you not believe in me?

I don’t know what to say baby, baby
And you wasn’t there on the everyday grind daily, daily
And you don’t know what stress is baby
You drive me crazy
You know me and you ain’t been on the same page baby
Claiming that you got my back baby
But you’re allowed to asking for money claiming that you were boarding my baby
But my baby here and that shit is crazy
Bitch you’re a liar and you’re shaded
You was never with me she went in the gym
And I would knew right back that she was fucking with him
You was never down, Rick Ride for me
That you was in it for money that’s the only ride

You ain’t even believe in me from the beginning anyway, anyway
I was tryin to tell you everything that was in front of me
Why you rock your ass at me, why you look away
When I was tryin to share my dreams with you and believe in me
You didn’t believe in me
You didn’t believe in me
You didn’t believe in me, believe in me
And it was hurting me
Why you not believe in me?
