[Intro]
They can't do nothin' about it
Yea
They can't do nothin' about it

[Hook: Future]
I write my check up, they can't do nothin' about it
We in them foreign coupe, they can't do nothin' about it
We got them bad bitches, they can't do nothin' about it
They can't do nothin' about it (x5)
I got my plug yes yes, they can't do nothin' about it
A hustler in the flesh, they can't do nothin' about it

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I gave a hunnit last night and I forgot all about it
Woke up the next morning like I threw all the profit
Finesse Dre out five bricks and he ain't do nothin' about it
I like to dress my dope up, to these bricks I'm a star
I keep my diamonds on shine cus these fuck niggas watchin'
Tap down in the town, Bentley coupe I'm drivin'
Dope price is up and down and you can't do nothin'' about it
Car shots like John Gotti, I get shit poppin'
Every move a nigga make I know my young niggas watchin'
20 cars hit yo block and you can't do nothing about it
I'm a international dope boy pluggin' with the folks boy
Always flexin' and you can't do nothin'' about it, fuck boy

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Future]
They straight up cut those surviving
They straight finessin' connivin'
That Lamborghini your ridin'
I catch yo bitch and I'm divin'
She in a bush and she hidin'
I fucked that bitch in the closet
And we ain't tellin' nobody
We put that shit on a spiral
Can't wave the magic on my list so we can fuck off some bands
She fell in love with that molly, whippin' up in a Cayenne
Most of my whips are exotic, I'm a free man travel band
You heard that bitch, I heard that bitch
Niggas on cus all my shine
Yea, I'm a international superstar and I get low like a movie star
Then I know plugs like Escobar
Poppin' through all that work
Hope that you won't get merked
Been a astronaut since my birth
My chain hang on my shirt
My money always on first

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I shed the streets down, and you can't do nothing about it
Tryna fuck the brick around and still make me some profit
I'm the last plug left, I'm the only option
Too much jail money, lot of dirty dollars
Young Scooter, I write my check up
Bad bitch with me, all she do is roll up
It's that drug music, make you do the count up
Let me go, they can't say shit bout us

[Hook: Future]
