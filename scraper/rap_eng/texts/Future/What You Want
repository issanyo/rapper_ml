[Intro: Future & Stefflon Don]
I fell in love, my money gettin' head
Free Bandz
I got you chillin' on my bed spread
Steff, what up?
My niggas in the feds, my niggas on deck
Rymez

[Pre-Chorus: Stefflon Don & Future]
They don't know my struggles (Struggles)
They don't know my pain (They don't know my pain)
They don't know how many times I almost went insane (Almost went insane)
They don't know the hustle (Hustle)
They can't feel my pain (They can't feel my pain)
That's why I'm cashin' out and I spend racks on racks on racks

[Chorus: Stefflon Don & Future]
On Gucci, Gucci (Gucci)
