[Hook: Future]
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
Fish parkay, numb ya face when ya taste
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way

[Verse 1: Future]
The money, the power, the cars, the love, the respect
Got a '69 Camaro 'round my muhfuckin' neck
But before you hit a plug, you used to call up your connect
You could tell I fuckin' fish I mean I'm playin' with a check
Got that money on my mind and it's easy to finesse
You got them racks on top on racks, that fish parkayin' is the best
Rockin' Cartier, oh yes, straight like chandelier oh yes
Aquafina clear, oh yes, Future outta here, oh yes
I brought the base with me, you could bet a cake on it
Got some old habits, ain't nothin' changed, I'm still on it
Spent so much on platinum, the kid shoulda been on it
Put the money to ya nose, you could smell the dust on it

[Hook: Future]
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
Fish parkay, numb ya face when ya taste
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way

[Verse 2: Future]
Got bands, got racks, got cash, got stacks
Got cheese, got cheddar, got mula, got fetti
Got pounds, got euros, got bacon, got scratch
Move packs, flip packs, get cash get get it
Get Grants, get jets, get green, get lean
Get Franks, got Macs, wanna play? We ready
Two stacks, three stacks, four stacks
Twenty mil', twenty mil', forty mil', we ready.
One comma, two, comma three, come and get llama get
Llama gotta get a dog, gotta add up digits
Few fishtail I'm too exquisite
Parkay fish, you could try lil' fishes
All these hits until we spend a sack
And since you know we did it
Yeah we did it, too consistent
I stay with it
We don't do it for the fame all we want is guap
We don't do it for the bitches cause we been had blocks
Get that cash, get that cash, want it off top
Put that money to ya nose get some dust in it

[Hook: Future]
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
Fish parkay, numb ya face when ya taste
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way

[Verse 3: Twista]
In the club tippin' the bartender with the old money
Cause I gotta keep the new money up in the safe
So I'm up in the VIP givin' out old hundreds
You could see them muthafuckas been around the way
Out on the block, in K-Town with the hustlas
Made it out South, goin' pier up after tier
Made it to the bitches to the strip club
Inside the thong goin' hip up after hip
Dirty money movin' around in the vicinity
If everybody gotta get it they be up in it when they on the grind
This here my play money
Some money I made before '09
If I see a nigga talkin' about I'm broke, I'ma tell a nigga man please
I'm still spendin' bucks from Adrenline Rush and my Slow Jam cheese
Bank accounts don't freeze, cause the flow is too cold
My stacks don't fit in my pocket cause the dough is too old, niggas be tellin' everybody they be ballin' but they don't run it
New paper put up, because I got them old hundreds

[Hook: Future]
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
I got them old hundreds, I got them old hundreds
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
Fish parkay, numb ya face when ya taste
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
