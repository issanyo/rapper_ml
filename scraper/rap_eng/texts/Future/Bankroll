24, 24/7
I done ran sack up, aww man (aww man)
I just poured the drank up, aww man (poured the drank up)
I done turnt them hoes up, aww man (aww man)
Had the whole city screaming "Aww man" (aww man)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
This right here Christian Dior
You never seen it before
Ever since a nigga tried me in Cali
I took a chopper on tour
You can ask TMZ, MTV, BET
I got more dimes than CP3
Came from the EBT, now these foe envy me
That's off the top just like Kennedy
See this is that pay style
I turn your girl to a Paypal
I'm turning dinner to takeout
I gave her D just like 8 Mile
Whew, Skittles and M&Ms
Murder and killer the synonyms
Even massages ain't feeling them
It's more than a threat than a synonym, ooh
I never fold under pressure
I keep that thing by the dresser
I keep it right by the Bible
I hope it don't mess up my blessings, Lord
You can ask Short I'm finessing
Yeah you can ask God I was reckless
Yeah you can ask Joe bout my neckless
Yeah he put all the ice in that motherfucker
I brought all the dice in that motherfucker
Straight hole like Yanks in this motherfucker
Shit you just cannot ignore
Pinky ring bigger than yours
And my lean pinker than yours
My girl pussy pinker than hers
I bought a Porsche just to trap in
I came on that cat when I'm bored

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Poppin' them Percs got me faded
I grab me a bowl and I grab me a fork
And I get in that shit and go crazy
Them diamonds, they on me, they blangin', they blangin'
So I see the truth and go skatin'
Bitch on that savage, I fuck a big check
And I fucked me a nigga old lady
Bitch I'm cold, I need a blanket
Yeah, I'm 'bout my 10
Roll it 'fore it flood, come where I begin
Broad niggas and I cheat on my ex
Pretty titties, I might skeet on her breasts
Skeet on her breasts
80 thousand, put that shit on my neck
80 thousand, spent that shit on a vet
One night stands, just I fuck and forget
Hold up, faded
Ciroc and Patron got me faded
Hold up, wait
These bitches gon' fuck if I blink
I run through that money, you can't
You faded and fuck up the bank
Bitch I'm on drugs, I can't think
You can't hang around if you ain't
