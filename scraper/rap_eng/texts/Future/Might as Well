[Hook]
So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (fact)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem (fact)
Either way it goes, we buyin’ out the stores (for real)
We ain’t never runnin’ out of lean, (never)
Might as well gon' pour it (pour)
Racks bustin’ out of niggas’ jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it (let's go)
We conversate and I absorb it (I got it)
Theodore, no informant (I got it)
Percocets got me goin' (goin')
OG, coughing up a lung (bet)

[Verse 1]
They got a street story to tell ya (Future)
It’s already been done (I got it)
Ammunition overflowin' (I got it)
Tears fillin' up a pond (woo)
AC blowin’ like it's snowin' (let’s get it)
I know I’m blessed to speak in tongues (Freebandz)
My words touch a nigga soul
To get you through it, overcome
I ride the boats in the ocean, I whipped the car, it was stolen
I got the stars on the ceiling, I got my charge acquitted
I was the one got evicted, yeah
Living with the pink slip now I'm ridin' with the pink slip
I done swam with the sharks, nigga came from the deep end
You will never know what I was in
Times were getting rough, we still get in
I was selling crack when Snoop dropped "Juice and Gin" (yah yah)
Run a one room shack with a million in the den (facts)

[Verse 2]
Workaholic, a few supermodels calling
Ain’t gonna expose ya, can’t say I ain't think about it (facts)
(Can’t say I ain't think about it)
Pink diamonds, no blinking, niggas got no dripping
Started off on a mission, I got real niggas still Crippin’
Child support gettin' heavy, it’s hard not to get offended
Oh, you maxin' out your credit card? Like it wasn’t hard for me
I just bought a new Bugatti for you

[Bridge]
Lived in it all, gotta take a trip and go ball (I gotta take a trip)
Packin’ no luggage, when I get there, I'm buyin' the mall
Get down, buy the mall
Ain't packin' no luggage, when I get down, buy the mall
