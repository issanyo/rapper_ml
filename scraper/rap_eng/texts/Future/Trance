"Trance"

You put me in a trance girl you put me in a
You put me in a trance girl you put me in a trance
Girl you put me in a trance
And I don't understand what happened to me girl
I just wanna be one of your friends
And I don't have to hug you
Long as I get to hold your hand
And don't try to figure out what it is
Baby it's the way you stand

You got me in a trance girl you got me in a trance
Yeah you got me in a trance
I don't know what got into me
Ever since I seen you think you put me out my misery
I'm not concerned with your companion or your history
Cause everytime we're together, I feel the chemistry
I touch your hand, I touch your heart and I might touch your mind
You can't deny the feeling that you're feeling when it's right
I tried to fight it, tried to hide it, swear I tried denying it
Don't have to be with you girl I just wanna stand beside you
You compliment my style, you compliment my whole...
You motivate me in so many ways, I keep on grinding
You shining like a star, you looking like some real diamonds
The way you make me feel I wanna buy you real diamonds

Hey, you put me in a trance, you put me in a
You put me in a trance
You put me in a trance, boy you put me in a trance
You put me in a trance
And I don't understand what it happened to me
I just wanna be one of your friends
And when I put it on you, bet I make you come again

She got too much love potential
She could be the valuest thing ever touched this earth
If she keep me on her temper, she pray for me every single day
During she not at church
I need a friend like you, I would do anything for you
You have this... about yourself that seem to jump on peop
And if you have a man, he would be a fool to leave you
I'm like your biggest fan when I met you how can I... you
I know I rap up for you, I be in our...
I know I trap, I take that dirty money and I clean them
And it ain't this about me girl you know we...
You not a cheater, but sometimes the way I need ya
I haven't seen in you in 2 weeks
It's been so hard in through these days
And if you ever feeling weak, let's go somewhere, run away
And if you ever feeling weak, I make you stronger everyday
And I just wanna see you smiling, and I'm willing do whatever it gonn take

Hey, you put me in a trance, you put me in a
You put me in a trance
You put me in a trance, boy you put me in a trance
You put me in a trance
And I don't understand what it happened to me
I just wanna be one of your friends
And when I put it on you, bet I make you come again
