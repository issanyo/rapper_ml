[Hook]
Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lumber
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

[Verse 1]
Cop a H3 with the big tires
I got money that will never expire
Took a chance and I became a idol
Who can do what I do, no rival
It’s just me and all my benjamins
Y’all start right, you need to experience this
4 bitches at once, try that now that’s an experiment
Then I don’t wanna be nowhere but inside this music bizz
I work the work and flip the work and bought me a big crib
I could make the first down to first song the bottom of my list
Talking piss poor, broke when you start thinking you ain’t shit
And then you make some millions off a planet that don’t exist

[Hook]
Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

[Verse 2]
Don’t mention even be explained
Bitch I rep that rich game
Close your mouth bitch you can go far
You know what it’s like to roll with a star
I know open doors I can get you chauffeur
We can drive around I don’t touch the wheel
I put swag on you and you taking off, outta here
I got diamonds chains and they put up like souvenirs
I don’t know what to do with money but to stack it up
Came a long way from watching out for them ups drugs
I just seen on drawn the package it’s on the porch
I’m just doing my exercise, finessing the sport

[Hook]
Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
