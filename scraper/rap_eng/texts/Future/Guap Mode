[Chorus: Future]
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
Guap got Os, club packed out
Gucci socks when I walk, shout out to my Op
Hit m with a beam, right outside his top


[Verse 1: Future]
Hangin with the gang, and it's good
Hangin with the gang in the cut
Whole lotta gang shit, AP on my main bitch
She know I'm reppin the set, I don't ever have that strange shit
Back of my Benz, who is this bitch
Never see no Roles Roice, always fall back
Swervin sideways,pretty money, everyday
I'm a stone cold 8 nigga
But I ain't stopped rockin Bape, nigga
Put you in the yello tape, nigga
Gold yard, sutecase, nigga
King Pluto, first place, nigga
I done ran up my cake, nigga
Fuck your wifey in her face, nigga

[Chorus: Future]
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
Guap got Os, club packed out
Gucci socks when I walk, shout out to my Op
Hit m with a beam, right outside his top

[Verse 2: Guap Tarantino]
Tarantino!
Run up my wrist, it tech
Diamonds on my neck, they cold
I just fucked that basic bitch, so now she top my bros
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
When I'm off the Xan, I shoot
I just fold the duse by 2
Bitch, I'm a real loose scrue
I like my hoes off Xannies, you broke, that's sad, boy
25 racks a package
25, let Jose count
I got good cush, now I'm fuckin on thots
In love with racks, Guap fell in love with the drank
We doing shit that a young nigga can't
I'm a young OG, bitch I done have bands
Got that bag, got that cash

[Chorus: Future]
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
I'm in guap mode, I'm in guap mode
Guap got Os, club packed out
Gucci socks when I walk, shout out to my Op
Hit m with a beam, right outside his top
