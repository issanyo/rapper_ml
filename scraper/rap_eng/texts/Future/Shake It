[Trey Songz]
Ass so fat with an ass like that, think a nigga like me
Gonna let a bitch like you walk past like that - I'm a big dog, I'm gonna kill that cat
Send that pussy to heaven, I click-clack that shit
She said she love my present like I gift wrap that dick
What you doing girl with all that?
Everybody getting money huh? Who's frontin'?
All around the world, these bitches love me
You trying to find your girl, she tryin' to fuck me
Shake that ass, stop and go, shake that ass, yeah pop it ho
+Girl On Fire+, Alicia Keys, girl on fire, drop and roll
Gushy gush, I pussy push, blow it down like kushy kush
Pussy chant that's pound for pound, told y'all like Reggie Bush
Dolphin, I swim in it (swim in it), +Dive In+, no fins in it (fins in it)
You talk shit while I'm diggin' in it, and if I kiss then my chin in it (nasty)
Say she wanna bring her friend in it, my mind lost but my dick winnin'
And you found love, but your bitch missin', I found her and she clique kissin' (shady)

[Future]
I'm a +Rolling Stone+, Mick Jagger swagger
Then I play with drums like I'm Tommy Leezy
+Bang Bang+, like Chief Keezy
She turnin up for me for no reason
From New York City to the Bay
That's how these bitches they like to play
Some big booty freaks
Pop it on a handstand, that how she eat
Word to my mother yo, word to my mother
If she fuck me like she dancin', I'mma love her undercover
I met a diamond in Miami like a month ago
It ain't an A-town bitch that won't do what I tell her to
