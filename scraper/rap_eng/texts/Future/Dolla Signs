Future Hendrix
Brianna baby, yeah i see you
You sweet but you feisty
I like it though

[Hook:Future]
Dolla signs all I see is dolla signs
From your head to to the floor million dolla signs
And you look like the racks on racks to me
Dolla signs thats all that i could see
Dolla signs, all I see is dolla signs
Soon as I wake up all I see is dolla signs
DDDolla signs DDDolla signs
Is you on my mind? yep you a dolla signs

[Verse 1:Brianna Perry]
DDDolla signs, All I see is dolla signs
Capital S with the two lines
Birkin bag with the boot shine
That Jag and the coupe mine
Designer leggings on my behind
How you gone hand me one dolla bitch
Im in the club with ten dimes
Rollie watch.......
