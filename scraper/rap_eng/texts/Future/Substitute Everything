I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
Smoke a lot of kush, I smoke a lot of kush (for what?)
Thinkin' I can blow away some pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
(How you manage this lifestyle?)
I'm tryin to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything

[Verse 1]
Today I took a Xanny, I started missin family
I don't see them as much, I know they feel abandoned
I'm workin 'til I pass out and now I understand it
From where I come from, every moment we tryna' take advantage
I got my prescription, prescribing, then hit the pharmacy
I got some hoes that been diving on my mind, mentally
Roll up the kush, and let’s get high, and take you to a galaxy
See I just wanna be in my zone, where nothin' bothers me

[Hook]
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
Smoke a lot of kush, I smoke a lot of kush (for what?)
Thinkin' I can blow away some thangs
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
(How you manage this lifestyle?)
I'm tryin to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything

[Verse 2]
I believe hard times made me like this
I don’t leave the studio, I like making hits
There’s broken relationships that I can’t fix
I got bad habits I picked up, I can't kick
I need my herb, I need my syrup
Now I'm free like a bird
I make a lot of mill's, I had to pop a pill
Just to get a thrill
You don't know how I feel

[Hook]
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
Smoke a lot of kush, I smoke a lot of kush (for what?)
Thinkin' I can blow away some pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
(How you manage this lifestyle?)
I'm tryin to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything

[Verse 3]
This bitch filed for child-support like I don’t take care of my child
She want them stacks I got on me, she wanna see me down
I had to take a molly, it lift me off the ground
I watch my dreams come true, I wish my granddad see me now (rest in peace)
I'm tryin to keep everybody happy, bring in the scripts
Everything calm and collective when I'm smoking on sess
Maybe this is the sound of faith, maybe this a test
I spend a lot of money so I don’t be depressed

[Hook]
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
Smoke a lot of kush, I smoke a lot of kush (for what?)
Thinkin' I can blow away some pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
(How you manage this lifestyle?)
I'm tryin to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything

[Outro]
The drug dealers need to know
That we want them out of our schools, neighborhoods and our lives
And the only way to do that is to take the customers away from the product
Say no to drugs
And say yes to life
‘Course your local drug pusher – they tell you a little something different about these drugs
And who you believe is up to you
Goddamn it. if you do it as enclined at least it won’t be out of ignorance, just stupidity
