I can damn near touch the sky when I walk outside on my balcony
I'm falcon flyer pelican as high as you will ever be
And I can see the stars from one of me
You stuck that kush inside them sickles lot we got dat cattle roll yeah
Blast off [3x]
We blowin up to da moon
Shout out to da goons
Salute me wen u see me
Filled wit money in da room
Blast off

[Verse 1]
Full of nitro thats that hydro
Get drunk everyday cinco de mayo
Money power drinkin on mud
Take it how u want it
You can dip it in da bud
We quickin it unda wood
Prolly take you 1 sludge
We smashin these bitches
Only takin 1 hug
Flyer than a sky above
One side of da car washing drugs
Pelican wit presidents
That garbage nigga that's ever been
Take a look at me now, evidence
Go harder than u eva went
I'm mixin of my medicine which sprite & ice on top of ice
Ima lifetime sacrafice damn right
Ima stuff this cash fo da perfect night
Persistent and me be precise
Pimpin by da place space, hustle [3x]

Blast off to da moon
Anytime you see da kid
Movies is all I do
