[Chorus: Future]
Lamborghini got a S
Parking lot look like a movie
My sex drive leave her woozy
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat
I ain't, I ain't even got no time to talk
It's all up to you, baby (i ain’t even got no time)
Diamonds dancing on my rubies
Savage mode is on ruthless
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you

[Verse 1: Future]
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row
I sit back on that Act' and sit low in that Ghost
Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes, yeah
The gold from my neck, it done got in my flesh, yeah
Parking lot look like a film, yeah
My duffel stuffed with a M, yeah
My shooters at basketball gyms, yeah
I got some permanent scars
I will not wait for tomorrow

[Chorus: Future]
Lamborghini got a S
Parking lot look like a movie
My sex drive leave her woozy
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat
I ain't, I ain't even got no time to talk, it's all up to you, baby ( I ain’t even got no time)
Diamonds dancing on my rubies
Savage mode is on ruthless
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
Queen back in the US, low iron, but you pressed
Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts
Stay in your bum-ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex
Queen never shuffle, you deal
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch
99 problems but ain't one a damn bitch
G4-fly even when I land, bitch
Lookin' like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch
I-I-I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic bitch
Shoe game on psychotic, bitch
Yes, I am iconic, bitch
P-Pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis
Every ball player tryna find this bitch
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch
I graduated with honors, bitch
I'm the truth like a motherfuckin' honest bitch
Full throttle switch
Pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch
Big MAC billboard out in Times Square
And I ain't talkin 'bout McDonald's bitch

[Chorus: Future]
Lamborghini got a S
Parking lot look like a movie
My sex drive leave her woozy
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat
I ain't, I ain't even got no time to talk
It's all up to you, baby
Diamonds dancing on my rubies
Savage mode is on ruthless
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
