[Verse 1: Future]
Break a brick down to deuces
Break a deuce down to dime
Let them bird take a bath
Yeah you get you some shine
I just got me a turbo Porsche
And brought me some diamonds
I can talk that narcotic talk cause I live it ain't lying
Had to step up my hustle, stack that paper for months
I came back from the coop, I'm in the trap in the booth
I hit the button on da roof, it transform right in the trunk
I'm a superstar and a hustler, I do what I want
Catch me working off my cell phone, and I got that iPad
And I'm doing crazy number you can call me Comcast
Drinkin on that dirty mud and I'm on that good gas
You can't come to Carolina, you ain't got ya hood pass

Break a brick down to deuces
Break a deuce down to dime
Let them bird take a bath
Yeah you get you some shine
Break a brick down to zips
I might whip me some sevens
I be trappin that work
I'm talking moving it heavy

[Verse 2: KMG Steezy]
I could straight my microwave and get a 1-25
I be droppin them bricks, I be droppin them pies
Bitch [?] so I whip em two at a time
I'm from home of the [?] so you know birds gonna fly
They come in clean, but they going out dirty
I'm talking selling a zip, that's a whole quarter birdie
We jack and we servin', acting nervous we take it
I talk it I live it, a lot a nigga be faking
I'm off no competition like I play for the Pacers
If you come to my trap, you'll say that be shakin'
Broke niggas hard me because I be fuckin they ladies
KMG gettin money and we blowin on Lakers
