[Hook: Trouble]
Ay I be geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked outta my mind
Still on point

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Ay I be geeked outta my mind
Rolling through the day time
Heard through the grapevine
My name all through the datelines
I’m just a thug who popped out the department of corrections
Lot of niggas only fuck with Duct Tape ‘cause they need protection
You gotta pay for this wall [?], while you still in your Caddy
I’m riding in exotic whips, women all on my tip
Dropped the D just like [?], yay, somebody call Ye
Tell him I’m in Chi-Town, institutionalized on Bombay
Spitting through the wire, I need fire for the bomb I got
Bought to light this kush and let it take over your whole spot
You say that you don’t smoke, now you provoked to go and hit the shit
Got you on the ropes, losing focus, need to go’n and sit
Down like Humpty Dumpty, I’m pumping, niggas ain’t jumping me
Should just change my name to 15, niggas stay bumping me
I’m Duct Tape crazy, what else, don’t know what you thought
Bloods on my right, and KK [?] bitch [?]
Got out in the winter but I’m waiting for the summer time
This summertime one of the realest, now that’s a humble line
I’m one of them humble guys that’s known to pull off all fire
Knock your face off, imagine your upside
Flip that, we get packs, shook that, we get bags
Purple kush, don’t mix that
OG make you sit back
Enough, the way you ain’t got it, experimental shit
Pink pouring and two [?], experimental dick

Ay I be geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out

Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked outta my mind

[Hook: Trouble]
Ay I be geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked outta my mind

[Verse 2: Future]
I’m geeked up to the moon
Young Future, just call me NASA
Never come to Earth no more
My nigga went past y’all
Alligator Gucci’s, I’m in a whole ‘nother element
True’s on the elephant, that’s a pocket full of presidents
You want that funk, you want that funk, I got Rick James bitch
I’m on that lean, I got that drink, you know it’s Actavis
The kick got me up like fuck ‘round this bitch
I wake up in the stars, every day a motion picture
Calculate the guap, neck full of rocks
Have you ever inhaled the fumes from ten blocks?
The money got me geeked just like it
When I’m standing on front of the stage and everyone recite it
It feel like a package when it got overnighted
Hard rest [?], but we still in it
We winning, nigga this only the beginning
And we gon’ be here ‘til the finish

[Hook: Trouble]
Ay I be geeked outta my mind
Geeked out, geeked out

Geeked out, geeked out
Geeked outta my mind
Geeked outta my mind
