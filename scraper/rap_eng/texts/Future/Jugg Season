[Hook: Young Scooter & Future]
I change like the streets, ‘cause it got seasons
Keep it low key, you got that cocaina
These street niggas snitching out for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season

I blend in good with the rich and famous
But that a never change the game that I'm claiming
You gotta change whips like you change clothes
They think I'm in the Illuminati, now I'm rocking gold

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I don’t even think before I make a move
And I never leave the house without the tool
In the streets, nigga, you can win or lose
I got bricks, I got bills, but I don’t fuck with you
Word on the street, a lot of niggas talking
I'mma work that jugg house, and I'm a keep on balling
My trap phone, I got every label calling
Jugg on the other line want a Miami Dolphin
Put the label on hold, now money talking
I talk big money ‘cause I’m boss status
Street first, rap second, that’s just how I call it
And you know I drink that lean like an alcoholic

[Hook]
I change like the streets, ‘cause it got seasons
Keep it low key, you got that cocaina
These street niggas snitching out for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season
I blend in good with the rich and famous
But that a never change the game that im claiming
You gotta change whips like you change clothes
They think I'm in the Illuminati, now I'm rocking gold

[Verse 2: Future]
Them niggas out here sneaky, but we still eating
Them niggas out here greezy, but we still working
I grind every day like I'm still hurting
I’m in the booth recording a song while my nigga serving
I took a couple niggas off, it was all worth it
I'm rocking gold like I'm King Tut, nigga fuck it
I keep some purple in my cup, I call it purple rain
You gotta watch out for these bitches trying to fuck for fame
I’m driving five different whips, five different days
And everything fully loaded from my cars and chains
You really think I'm talking to the devil for the fame
I’m burning money up and thats on everything I claim

[Hook]
I change like the streets, ‘cause it got seasons
Keep it low key, you got that cocaina
These street niggas snitching now for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season
I blend in good with the rich and famous
But that a never change the game that I'm claiming
You gotta change whips like you change clothes
They think I'm in the Illuminati, now I'm rocking gold
