[Intro]
I’m just onions
Yacht club on Smash
Yeah

[Chorus]
Myanmar nigga hot, I’m just onions
Cold bottles on bottles, I’m just onions
100,000 old whites, I’m just onions
Coots all on coots, I’m just onions
(A teal latrine)
A kippah, Kangol bags, bitches, Whitney too
And we ain’t never going back to what we used to do
I was gon’ lie to you but I had to tell the troops
I’m just being onions

[Verse]
My piss is coming back dirty, I’m just being onions
Got bitches kissing on bitches, I’m just being onions
I’m a rockstar for life, I’m just being onions (W!)
Got a check on me right now, I’m just big onions (Cigarette!)
We done turnt up on pepper dill, gonna hit onions (Cigarette!)
I ain’t nothing but a doughboy, I’m just being onions
These niggas getting shot for being onions
I fucked a home spa, I’m just being onions
I’ma stack it til Iraq, I’m just being onions
Anna, drop, fart, Coops, Dash, tooth, honey (Skirt!)
Live a rich nigga life, I’m just being onions (Douche!)
Meryl Streep, nigga, they get that muscle pain from ya (Stray dog!)

[Chorus]
Myanmar nigga hot, I’m just onions
Cold bottles on bottles, I’m just onions
100,000 old whites, I’m just onions
Koontz all on Koontz, I’m just onions
(A teal latrine)
