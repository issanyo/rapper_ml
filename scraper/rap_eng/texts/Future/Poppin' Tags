[Intro]
Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Hermès, oh, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

[Verse 1]
What the fuck is you talkin' bout, I can get ya ass hit
Hop out a Corvette nigga, then gon' smash ya bitch
I got American muscle nigga, I'm gonna hit me a lick
Sippin' on 'Tussin, fuckin' and hustlin'
I bet I'm gon' floss, hate it or love it
A full grown boss, hate it or love it
Dope boys shoppin' at Walters, I bought the whole store
Fuck boy doin' that talkin', that's my old hoe
Stars inside the ceiling, I'm on go go
You don't want no war, nigga, oh no
Codeine floodin' Atlanta, bitch ass niggas with hammers
Bitch ass niggas in Pampers, fuck around murk his mamma
My young niggas so playa, fuck around kill you in sandals
I was on some cool shit now they want the nana

[Pre-Hook]
King Jaffe Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

[Hook]
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

[Verse 2]
I came here to purchase, I ain't worried 'bout a ticket
Bitch you want that G-Wagon?, go muthafuckin' get it
I had on my ski mask in the muthafuckin' trenches
Homie Blood talkin', is you muthafuckin' Crippin'?
I get the plug talkin' 'bout these muthafuckin' chickens
Put up some lean, my Frank-a-lins
I run ‘em right through a machine
I'm 'bout to lose the roof, they tryna steal the juice
Cuban hangin' on my neck, whip on cruise
I just copped the Coupe, 63's with the Forgi's
Bought a couple 'Raris and I bought a couple Porsches
Zone Six fuck shit, finessin' and extortin'
Twenty diamond chains and got seven different choices

[Pre-Hook]
King Joffy Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

[Hook]
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

[Verse 3]
Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Hermès on, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Catch me goin' goon, smashin' on a womb
Fuck your baby daddy, smash you on the Xanny
Iced out Kodaks, got you in your feelin's
Just to get the feelin', spend a couple million
I go Godzilla in the Roley store, vroom
We just got the pack in from Mexico, vroom
Soon as it touch down I'm goin' ape
Put it on the hood like you claim Grape
Pull up in the hood in a new Wraith

[Pre-Hook]
King Joffy Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

[Hook]
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

[Outro]
Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Oh, pick out what you want
Oh, pick out what you want
Catch me goin' goon, smashin' on a womb
