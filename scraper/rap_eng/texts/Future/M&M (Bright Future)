[Intro: Future]
I done been to broke, talking 'bout the brokest
Sick broke! Like you ain't never been so broke you can barely breathe
The air don't even smell the same nigga, your food don't taste the same nigga
You can't even eat right, your appetite ain't right
You God damned, asking on your homeboy who probably got money in his pocket
& it's just, you a man nigga you're over 21 & you're looking at all the mistakes you made
Getting myself to this point where I'm just in life nigga, feel like you ain't nothing
You know what I'm saying so I done been to that point where it's like any chance I get
Man I can't never see that person because I know I ain't built for that I'm built for greatness
I got to my lowest point where I know how to live without everything, including people
You feel me?
When you get to that low point, you don't have nobody because everybody look at you different
Because they don't look at you as an asset they look at you as a liability
& when you become that it's just like, man you're worthless to anybody around you
That's how they're looking at you in actual reality
Because they don't feel like you're gonna be able to generate revenue to help them out
Because they're looking at your situation for the now, you know what I'm saying?
But as I learned, I leaned how to make chess moves & it ain't about where I'm at now
I know right now I'm doing this but I know where I'm gonna be five years from now
Because I'm going through it & I know the moves & the sacrifices & the work I'm putting in
I know because I done been broke
I don't wanna go back!

[Refrain]
Money & me, stack my dollars
Money & me, stack my dollars

[Hook]
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Front row seat keep your head up
Move like yeast keep the bread up
Blow bands on a better set up
Money talks mine won't shut up

[Verse]
"Don't watch another mans paper chase" the words of my father
A man who wasn't present on my day to days, go figure
I haven't see that nigga in years, like ego & fear he only exists in my ears
He's stuck in another country fucked up when he was young or something
But shit we all fucked up
My first job was summer camp yeah, innocence is bliss I know truth is in the kids
First check I think I'm eating, blow it on lunch
Swag-less blowing money on clothes though
First set I think I'm dreaming, it's all from a hunch
Jobless steady working pro bono
The hours are very extensive, penny pinching put me in pensive
The best things in life are free & the second best are very expensive

[Hook]
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Front row seat keep your head up
Move like yeast keep the bread up
Blow bands on a better set up
Money talks mine won't shut up

[Verse]
Dollar signs on my mind eyes won't shut, I need money now hit my boss like "what up?!"
You cut the check then our ties get cut, fuck 9 to 5 can't rely on others
Geez getting Paid In Full is what I need like Mitch
Living good eating healthy that's rich
Wanna be free? Find your peace, find your niche
I wish people didn't switch
It's me & my music, me money making, more money problems
Momma need dollars it's getting Rocky like Benihana
Gotta fiend for the green like 20 dollars, just never lose your peace partner
Top of the morning on a hill top in full lotus
Itchy palms I sense dollars on the horizon
Cause when it was time to get my money up
I put all that extra shit away, no tummy tuck

[Hook]
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Money & me, stack my dollars, Money & me, stack my dollars
Front row seat keep your head up
Move like yeast keep the bread up
Blow bands on a better set up
Money talks mine won't shut up

[Outro:Future]
I'll spend everything in my pocket
But if it get deposited I don't ever withdrawal no money
I ain't.. No
I call the bank
"What's my balance"
They like "You just called!"
I'm just tryna make sure it's still there
