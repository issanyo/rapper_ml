[Hook: Future]
This lifestyle is way way too much for me
These diamonds 'bout to leave a bunch of cuts on me
I'm tryna get my bread they wanna frustrate me
I smoke one to the head and take a shopping spree
Don't tell me you was thinking I was comfortable
These Benjamins and Franklins way too tangible
Times was very hard now we wake up take vacation
I was servin' hard spent a brick on my lady

[Verse 1: Don Juan]
Money taker brand new vision been holdin' it down
Most niggas fake, these niggas snakes I can tell when they 'round
Got tunnel vision for the paper, no slowin' me down
When I was broke without a clue there was no way around
Grinded till my status changed now I'm lookin' for millions
See this lifestyle that I'm livin' this right here might kill 'em
Avoidin' all them pussy niggas, salutin' the real ones
All I do is point a finger my niggas gon kill somethin'
Watch the shit that I created turn into some millions
Hey, my lifestyle is way, way
This lifestyle is way, way

[Verse 2: Future]
Who said we can come from out the hood and spoil ourself
Coppin' all them foreigns they want me to starve myself
[?] pull up in a dodge, nigga that's my first [?]
I already paid a jeweler I can go ice myself
I'm lookin' like money you sad
The Cuban link came with the Herm
This money is straighter than perm
I got bad bitches takin' turns
Came from rags to riches this was earned
I'm a real nigga with this currency
They said hood niggas wouldn't make it far man I couldn't wait for my turn

[Interlude: Future]
I'm rollin' three dices
Issa job where we come from
You broke with the piper, you lookin' like a intern
Froze up with ice, I already told you I was on Trap-a-thon
I precisely get it done, uh
