[Intro]
True Story
FreeBand gang nigga
Young Will in this bitch

[Hook: Future]
Money coming in from every angle
Paper chasing running to it tryna break my ankle
Evertime I spread tragedy I’m speaking ether
I oan' wanna go to sleep the money got me geeked up
On my way to Puerto Rico with this Mamacita
Bout to blow the whole feature on some Indonesia
Anytime these bitches see they gone take the E
You a Freehand nigga they can’t wait to greet ya

[Verse 1: Future]
My words coming out dope this should be illegal
I’m flyer than a eagle
We can never be the same I’m baby Jesus
All my niggas on a plane, you can never reach us
Then get it in it for the fame, I’m the fuckin’ picture
You my fuckin student and you should be thankful
Im picasso, see the picture I paint ya
I’m great for niggas, imma have to teach ya
Moment of silence reast in peace ya

[Future]
You want a ring don’t you
I’m so swift the way I’m moving
My whole team ballin’

[Hook: Future]
Money coming in from every angle
Paper chasing running to it tryna break my ankle
Evertime I spread tragedy I’m speaking ether
I oan wanna go to sleep the money got me geeked up
On my way to Puerto Rico with this Mamacita
Bout to blow the whole feature on some Indonesia
Anytime these bitches see they gone take the E
You a Freehand nigga they can’t wait to greet ya

[Verse 2: Future]
Never take a [?] like tiger my team in order, [?]
I’m screaming to the water
The niggas wanna hate on me that bout to me my employees
I should make you sure but I got a job for ya
Fish scale profit I’mma tell my niggas with it
I tell you when I short it ill be worth a couple tickets
Hundred million now I break my ankle tryna get it
My watch cost a car my car cost a phone digit
I’m too exquisite, Gucci fitted, feel sedition
Mud sippin, water dripping, on a mission, make a real decision
Real persistent, ton of vision, off the game like in the world
Can't compare to this dirty business
All the money in the world

[Hook: Future]
Money coming in from every angle
Paper chasing running to it tryna break my ankle
Evertime I spread tragedy I’m speaking ether
I oan wanna go to sleep the money got me geeked up
On my way to Puerto Rico with this Mamacita
Bout to blow the whole feature on some Indonesia
Anytime these bitches see they gone take the E
You a Freehand nigga they can’t wait to greet ya

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Freehand Scooter, they greet me when they see me
Bossman status, seen some shit you see on TV
Plus I’m bout to cop the Bugatti like Birdman
I’m a young nigga with more like Weezy and Mack Maine
Done made a 2.5 on cocaine, in 12 months I have a whole year run
Freehand meetings in Puerto Rico with Hector, me and Isabella
Scooter always flexing

[Future]
You want a ring don’t you
I’m so swift the way I’m moving
My whole team ballin’

[Hook: Future]
Money coming in from every angle
Paper chasing running to it tryna break my ankle
Evertime I spread tragedy I’m speaking ether
I oan wanna go to sleep the money got me geeked up
On my way to Puerto Rico with this Mamacita
Bout to blow the whole feature on some Indonesia
Anytime these bitches see they gone take the E
You a Freehand nigga they can’t wait to greet ya
