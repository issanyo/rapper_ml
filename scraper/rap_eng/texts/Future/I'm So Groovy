[Intro]
I am Pluto
Never forget, never forget
Okay

[Chorus]
I'm so groovy, I got power
I'm so groovy, I got power
That’s your bitch? I just bought her
Oh that’s your bitch? I just bought her
Percs and molly (mhm), Plain Jane (mhm)
I just fucked her face (mhm), I don’t know her name (mhm)

Goin' brazy at the jeweler (mhm)
I just suicide my doors (mhm)
Candy yams in the ‘partment (mhm)
Living like Nino (mhm)
I just come here, let me breathe (mhm)
VVS’s on my sleeves (mhm)

Blind your eye with my ring (mhm)

[Verse 2]
I'm the last don, I'm the last con
Done turned it up to an icon
Pimpin’ hoes nigga ugh
Thots expose niggas huh
Paper tags on the yacht
I just smashed in the clouds
Thousand bags in the clouds
Louis rag, wipe me down
Cash king on a clown
So prestigious, so profound
Cash cloud, let me live
50 cars at the crib
Private dinners on the leer
VVS’s when I steer
Instant glam on my ear
Outer space when I appear
Promethazine in my seal
A yellow bone in the rear
Dap a God, I’m in here
Fuck your squad, they some queers
My conversation bringing mills to ya
I get my brother to bring the bales to ya
Killas on the right and the left to ya
Gang gang, whatever’s left of ya

[Chorus]
I'm so groovy, I got power
I'm so groovy, I got power
That’s your bitch? I just bought her
Oh that’s your bitch? I just bought her
Percs and molly (mhm), Plain Jane (mhm)
I just fucked her face (mhm), I don’t know her name (mhm)

[Bridge]
I don’t know her name (mhm)
I don’t know her name (mhm)

Sitting in the 'vert (mhm)
Got a lotta dirt (mhm)
Courtroom flow (mhm)
Now I’m sitting courtside with your ho (mhm)
Addy’s work miracles (mhm)
Benji’s subliminal (mhm)

All about the Benji’s (mhm)
Pour a little Henny (mhm)
Totin' the semi (mhm)
Making love with my diamonds on (mhm)
Diamonds on honeycomb (mhm)
Hit 'em with the stick, ooh ooh
I just copped the deu-u-uce (mhm)
Syrup like Denny’s (mhm)
Bitch brown like a penny (mhm)
Tote it up in one minute (mhm)
Out of the country I hit it (mhm)
Playing with the trenches in a suit
Armani got me with the juice
Made a bad bitch my masseuse
Take a little stress off the crew

[Chorus]
I'm so groovy, I got power
I'm so groovy, I got power
That’s your bitch? I just bought her
Oh that’s your bitch? I just bought her
Percs and molly (mhm), Plain Jane (mhm)
I just fucked her face (mhm), I don’t know her name (mhm)

[Post-Chorus]
I don’t know her name (mhm)
I don’t know her name (mhm)
