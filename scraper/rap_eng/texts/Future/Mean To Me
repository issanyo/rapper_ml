Don't be coming around here false claiming
Don't you come around here false claiming
Better not come around here false claiming, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
I can show you what that money 'bout
Pull up right now with a 100 shots
I can should show you what that dummy is 'bout
Soon as the dry hit, we dummy out
Shawty she still on the percocets
Fucking around with them mollies too
Heard you was serving that white girl
We got a line of that dog too
Fuck that lil ho, I'm a dog too
Fuck on that ho, I'm a dog too
Fuck that lil ho, she a dog too
Fuck that lil ho, she a dog you
Fuck that lil ho, I'm a dog too
I got that ho on a walkthrough
Came over late night and smashed too
Came up with this cash so fast too
Real niggas always in tune with me
Step in the club with them goons with me
I brought some molly and shrooms with me
I got the molly and shrooms with me
You better squeeze it until it's empty
You better squeeze it until it's empty
You better squeeze it until it's empty
You better squeeze it until it's empty
Count that money then I pass out
I just came from a cash route
Going brazy with the cash flow
Gave that molly to my last ho
Came through with my mask on
Hydroponic and some styrofoams
Real niggas know the code baby
Still open doors for the old ladies
Wacked off a nigga old lady
Cause she knew too much 'bout this old paper
Foreign coupes, my transportation
I'ma shoot like Radric Davis

[Hook: Future]
I'm going hard for this lifestyle I live
That's how much it means to me
I kept my word with you niggas
Showing you how much you mean to me
I came all way with you niggas
Showing you how much you mean to me
I kept my word with you niggas
Showing you how much you mean to me

[Verse 2: Zona Man]
FBG, fuck all them extra niggas
Been true to this shit since they blessed a nigga
Got Migos for bricks, they investing niggas
Stacks up them blocks like it's tetris nigga
Standing on couches with bloods nigga
Run up on me, I'ma show a nigga
Zona finnesser, I eat all these niggas
These niggas is turkey, no beef with these niggas
She love me, she love me, she love me
She love me, she hate me
Got niggas that's waiting on this work
And I hate that they waiting
One life to live, and I'm living it nigga
All this for my kids and my niggas that with me
Pull up in the hood with them Benzies and Bentlies
Pull up in the hood with them killers they with me

[Hook: Future] (x2)
I'm going hard for this lifestyle I live
That's how much it means to me
I kept my word with you niggas
Showing you how much you mean to me

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Put ten on my head go get a refund
We don't like thirties, we turn up with drums
Pour me up an eight just to get numb
Trap house is booming, for 9 to make bond
Fuck a fake nigga, we call a knockoff
Savage with activas, pull up and go dumb
I'm the only Durk close to a don
But city ain't capitol-murder for none (Chiraq)
Police ass niggas be working for none
Police ass niggas be telling for less
OTF 300, my nigga we blessed
Chop a brick down on a boat, then we mail it
My background nigga, jugg jugg
My cases I caught, was aggravated weapon
Blessing, blessing to be a real nigga
And to be here to tell it yea, yea
Shit ain't been the same, since I lost Nuski
Since I dropped my album it's been a movie
I got the city hating and they wanna do me
I do this shit for Chino and Nuski yea yea yea
