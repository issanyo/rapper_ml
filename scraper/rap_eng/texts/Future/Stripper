[Intro: DJ Stevie J & Future]
Pluto
She movin' her body, she movin' it slow
But she said she not a stripper
You with her best friend so let her know
Let her know that she can get it
See I know you like the finer things baby
Well that money ain't an issue (Freebandz)
Bitch you make me want to tip you (woo), yeah

She dancin' like a stripper (whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
