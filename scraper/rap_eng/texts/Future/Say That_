[Verse 1: Future]
We poppin' that Ace of Spades
Servin' that Ronald Reagan
You makin' them Dead Presidents
I'm on medicine, and I'm elegant and I'm relevant
In a wide body, [?]
And there's nothing they can do about it
Knock on the door like Jehova
I put the dope with the soda, turned coke to a boulder
Dropped the rents on the Rover
Got it stashed by the motor
Gotta whip me some dodi
Fell in love with all this [?]
Got your wifey wifey on that dirty dirty now
Spend a hundred thousand that's a hundred thousand
Fuck a hundred thousand, fuck a hundred thousand

[?]

[Verse: Casino]
