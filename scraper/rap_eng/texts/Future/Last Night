[Intro: Future]
Yeah, yeah
Tru told me like, "Pluto, nigga, you abnormal, nigga"
I sound abnormal
They don't have no clue what mothafuckin' happened
Burn this bitch down
Land a jet like anywhere, know what I'm sayin'?
Streets love us (Myles William)
Yeah!

[Chorus: Future]
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (woo)
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (ah!)
Last night they caught a body (ah!)
Last night he caught a body (woo)
Last night he caught a body (ah!)
Last night he caught a body

[Verse 1: Tru Life]
I don't need no extendo, 1 shot to the mind (blat)
I get even with odd numbers, 357's and 9's
Mogul Tree, Freebandz chain, I'm down to die for that shine
40 Madison, gang gang outside of Crown Fried (bang)
Tru-Tru in the blue coupe runnin' choo choo on your new new
Dog her out like Blue's Clues, doggystyle like woof woof
Ros√© in my Fruit Loops, hard time, I done did that
Came home, niggas still pussy, came to take my shit back
Trap, trap, trap, I peel his wing off at the red light
I ain't fuck her but I know just what her head like
Uh, I'm actin' crazy in the club again
Blew a bag on Aces like I ran off on the plug again
Chain shoppin' in the club, lames better tuck 'em in
100 hoes at the door, tell a homie, "buzz 'em in" (buzz 'em in!)
If you a real hustler, I'll recruit ya
But if Future don't trust ya, I'ma shoot ya
Blat, blat, blat!

[Chorus: Future]
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (woo)
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (ah!)
Last night they caught a body (ah!)
Last night he caught a body (woo)
Last night he caught a body (ah!)
Last night he caught a body

[Verse 2: Future]
Boom boom to the moon moon
Got goon-goons on shrooms
In the night, nigga, in the noon
Nigga, pop pop like balloon
And I'm stuffed up, nigga, I'm drugged up
Shoot it up and then zoom
Ain't no cuffin' hoes, ain't no cuffin', ho
We so quick to let 'em loose
100 shots, let 'em loose
100 goons, let 'em loose
Get the tool, let it loose
Let it loose, let 'em loose
You know the work don't lose
You know my niggas don't lose
You know a nigga got juice, I already had juice
Know a nigga got proof, y'know a nigga gotta prove
I already had juice, I already had juice, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (woo)
Last week they robbed the plug (woo)
Last night he caught a body (ah!)
Last night they caught a body (ah!)
Last night he caught a body

[Outro: DJ Clue]
They said it's gon' be a storm
It's that desert talk
Mogul Tree Mafiosi, Freebandz be the gang
Brrrrrrrat!
