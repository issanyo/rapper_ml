Come back again!
You're here, babe

We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna neva

Chorus:
We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

Future:
I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I’ll go to war over you, I don’t give a fuck about showing you
You know what it is, shorty, forever my little shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in benjamins, you shop with no limited
You’ll see reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breathe without me, you gon’ need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us!

Hook:
We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions, you got all the answers
I done took your heart, boy, held it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

Kelly Rowland:
Oh, neva say neva
From the day we got together
I thought it'd be forever but, baby, oh
You showed your true colors
I can’t believe you played me
I let you meet my mother!
Oh, you hung out with my brother
My significant other
You know I still love you, baby
Oh, boy, you make me so mad
But I just come right back
It’s like I can’t get over you
I can’t get over you
And the things that you do
Swear I don’t want nobody but you, baby!

Future:
Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you'd rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me
Actually that’s a guarantee
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another league
I ain’t tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

Hook:
We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions, you got all the answers
I done took your heart, boy, held it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
