[Hook: Future]
I got my eyes on you
Can't take them off of you
I'm already hooked on you
I can't take my eyes off of you
Can't take them off of you

[Verse 1: Future]
I got this bitch on my team
Standing right by the stage
And I can tell the way she looking
This girl ain't afraid
She got a nice physique
I hope she go both ways
Cause' I got girls with me
Trynna have a parade
You got my full attention
I wanna take you to another dimension
You all inside my vision
You fuck with Future, Girl you know you winning
I'm already addicted

[Bridge 1: Stuey Rock]
I like the smile on you
Got money but I rather spend this time on you
You got me mesmerized by the things you do
Gon make me take a knee and put this ring on you
Put this ring on you

[Hook: Future]
I got my eyes on you
Can't take them off of you
I'm already hooked on you
I can't take my eyes off of you
Can't take them off of you

[Verse 2: Stuey Rock]
See I got bitches dime a dozen
I fuck sister's friend's cousins
And they get the pussy popping
I put something in their stomach
I go hard
On my momma this go off
And the way your body move
You got me throwed off
My mind is so gone
Gotta get you alone
Girl come back to my crib and we can smoke 'til it's all gone
And you can bring your friends
And I'mma call my friends
And we gon' take this ride and you gon' hope it never end

[Bridge 2: Future]
I like the smile on you
Got money but I rather spend this time with you
Got me mesmerized off the little things you do
You gon' make me hit the mall and buy the mall for you
I'mma buy the mall for you
