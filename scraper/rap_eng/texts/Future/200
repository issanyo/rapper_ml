[Intro: Young Thug]
Everything right
Everything right
Everything right
Now everything right
Fuck all these niggas
Everything right, we rockin' Givenchy
I only drink Actavis, I'm on a diet
I'ma chase it like Usain
All this money bring a nigga new pain
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got at least 200 hoes
Fresh to death, and I leave my car and then I doze
Up and down the E-way, risk it all 'bout this dough
And these hundreds ain't goin' nowhere like a mole

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I bought my moms a car, it felt amazin'
My niggas bangin' burgundy like the Redskins
I got all type of tattoos on my fuckin' shin
I was in a white and red Maybach like peppermints
I been blowed a mil' on jewelry, but it's past tense
Supercharge it, make it sound like it's raggly
I'm ridin' with the cutter, I'm Blood like my brothers and MAC-10
Diamonds on me talkin', they harassin'
No shoulda, could, and would, I got these racks in
Came a long way from a shed
Now we spend millions on cribs
You get somethin' too, don't trip
My eyes 'bout low as a brim
I smoke the tree limb, tree limb
No gang, big deal

[Verse 2: Future & Young Thug]
I'm tryna pop a wheelie in a Lamborghini, standin' on two wheels
I got the racks on me now, could buy me a cruise ship
I just got an iPhone 8 and I already stored it with 200 hoes
You smell the money on me, come from off my clothes
Majority of the 'fits I wear, you'll never find in stores
You might as well go'n, on, on home
Money long, long, long, long
All the way up to Mercury
Any time I come out, gotta at least step out with a three piece
I've been in my bag lately
Take three drugs at once, lately
Got every shade of Tom Ford, I can spot fugazi
I came out the slums, I
Got Hermes in a headlock
If she ain't up to par, she 'bout to get dead docked
Between my diamonds and my fame, became so anxious
I sit at the top of the throne, yeah, 'cause I'm righteous
Got a few Vice Lords for some friends, some of 'em Disciples
And can't nothin' come in between niggas like us (Yeah yeah), hey

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got at least 200 hoes
Fresh to death, and I leave my car and then I doze
Up and down the E-way, risk it all 'bout this dough
And these hundreds ain't goin' nowhere like a mole
