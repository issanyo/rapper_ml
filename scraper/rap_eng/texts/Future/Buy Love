[Hook]
Lot of love
A lot of love for you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all night
I'm buyin' love from you
I'm buyin' love from you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all night

[Verse 1]
Tender when you taste, girl you spiteful, oh
Pissin' out this Ace like Franklins
Had a dream I woke up to a diva
Tastin' pink molly like it's Easter
Let me go, I'm goin' to the Oscar's
We made a film last year, got me popular
I keep my ego cockin', I keep that Glock cockin'
I got these ice drops, can't let the ice stop

[Pre-Hook]
Peelin' up these hundreds like oooh
I don't know where our love begun
Got you runnin', runnin' with my tongue
Open you up, let it cum

[Hook]
Lot of love for you
A lot of love for you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all night
I'm buyin' love from you
I'm buyin' love from you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all

[Verse 2]
Showed you the keys, all these foreigns I own
Left my OG, I've been out on my own
She speak four languages, she calls me my home
Sit in a sanctuary, I'm all alone
I wanna love you, more of you without me
Exclusivity, let me be your remedy
Sexual chemistry, we don't show no sympathy
I want you spiritually, but I need you more mentally

[Pre-Hook]
Peelin' up these hundreds like oooh
I don't know where our love begun
Got you runnin', runnin' with my tongue
Open you up, let it cum

[Hook]
Lot of love for you
A lot of love for you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all night
I'm buyin' love from you
I'm buyin' love from you
They ain't got enough for you
I'm buyin' love from you

[Pre-Hook]
Peelin' up these hundreds like oooh
I don't know where our love begun
Got you runnin', runnin' with my tongue
Open you up, let it cum

[Hook]
Lot of love
A lot of love for you
They ain't got enough for you
I can have you workin' all night

[Outro]
Before you give up on me, cry a river twice
I seen your heart skipped a beat last night
That's gon' happen if you give up on my promise
We have sex, talk back like it's drama
Let me inside, ohhh
Want this, pour liquor, me all night
Just keep me inside
Girl, whatever you want ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl, whatever you want ooh-ooh-ooh
Just keep me inside
Girl, whatever you want ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl, whatever you want ooh-ooh-ooh
