[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Risk my life for my partna, care if it's right or wrong
So much pain in my body, I've been like this too long
So much tryna stop me but I keep movin' on
I never give up, I gotta keep it strong
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin' on site, my heart cold at night
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin on site, my heart cold at night

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was standin' outside of the door when Terell had stuck up the store
Look at my eyes tell me what you see, whole lotta pain, you can't say that you don't
Give up on you, I won't say that I won't, a lotta people I had that to leave alone
Momma told me that I'm goin' to jail, I ain't respond I just hung up the phone
Them niggas round you they gone change on you, how can you say that?
The whole time I was locked in a cell, they was holdin' my back (no lie)
On everything, that's a fact, I ain't never lookin' back
I ain't never goin' back, forever gon' run up that sack
Spit nothing but the truth when I spit on the track
Show my scars, I do not wear a hat
Baby Joe put that Draco to his back
Baby Joe put that Draco to his cap
That shit that you talkin', I tell you it's cap
Don't talk on that phone I know that it's tapped
Fuck jail I don't wanna go back
Fuck hell yeah I'm living thru that
Need money take me to where is at
NBA, I put that on the map
Everyday they be up in the trap
Death on me so I stay with a strap
It's gon happen ain't no runnin' from that
Hope my sons could grow up with a dad
I be scared real quick I get mad
I've been scared I do this for my friends

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Risk my life for my partna, care if it's right or wrong
So much pain in my body, I've been like this too long
So much tryna stop me but I keep movin' on
I never give up, I gotta keep it strong
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin' on site, my heart cold at night
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin' on site, my heart cold at night

[Verse 2: Future]
I've been doing everything wrong, draped up in VVS stones
When I want Chanel I put it on, caught the Balenciaga put it on
Hop the Lamborghini and I'm gone, I don' hit a lick, fuckin' wrong
I was sellin' nicks in the zone, I don' ran it up, money long
I just speed race to the dollars, got cuban link on my collar
Keep a plain AP on my wrist, I done already got rich
Got 20 chains in the vault, put a dog food to my dawg
I'm on Prometh' every single day, I donâ€™t never have withdrawals
The streets, they callin' my name, start gainin' a little fame
Drive the bitches insane, most niggas gonna change
My niggas stay the same, switchin' in and outta lanes
I just cop the new Range, only drove it one time
Still thuggin one time, turn a seven to a dime
Whoop the four into a nine, flawless diamonds gonna shine
Make a nigga go blind, I've been walkin' like a head light
Get a different head everynight, gotta understand I love this life
Treat the 5 star hotel like some motherfuckin' projects, I recognize that I'm blessed
I'm very different from the rest, put my niggas on jets
Just to motivate the thugs, just to show a nigga love

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Risk my life on my partna, care if it's right or wrong
So much pain in my body, I've been like this too long
So much tryna stop me but I keep movin' on
I never give up, I gotta keep it strong
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin' on site, my heart cold at night
Things ain't been goin' right, take a risk and you gamblin' your life
Forever thuggin' on site, my heart cold at night
