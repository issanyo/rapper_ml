[Hook]
I'm a stone cold guerrilla, it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - It’s in my DNA
I'm stackin' paper every day, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - it’s in my DNA
I just pour me up a Ace, it’s in my DNA

[Verse 1]
I feel like Tarzan and King Kong, LV on my three phones
Them iphones, that 5G, that 4G, I'm too G, I'm too street
I'm 3D, I'm HD, these movies that I make
Can’t see me, you capische
I’m a titan, I fly in, like a pelican
You irrelevant, to a president, on medicine
It’s that kilo, you fuck dingy hoes, el chapo
Young future fuckin’ on pocket holes
We re-up then reload, I blow up, then explode
I'm organized like a crime boss, I'm up there like a mafia
That's a fresh new Balenciaga, all dreaded up like a Rasta
Got a million soldiers on my roster
No chains on and I’m aqua, fina, water
I slaughter your daughters, I’m known in Bal Harbour

[Hook]
I'm a stone cold guerrilla, it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - It’s in my DNA
I'm stackin' paper every day, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - it’s in my DNA
I just pour me up a Ace, it’s in my DNA

[Verse 2]
I’m sucker-free dog, pass me my sprite
I’m an ATLien and they say I’m way way out of sight
Aye that baby bottle syrup, man that shit keep me on point
I was servin’ furl, tryna make my rent first of the month
And I got your girl, and I filled her mouth with a lot of cum
I’m rollin’ big blunts, gotta keep some ganja down my lungs
Hard times, turned me to a maniac
My blood line - motion pictures cinematic
Mix it up - mix it up, mix it up
Pour it up - pour it up, pour it up
Styrofoam, cellphone, bakin’ soda
I'm screwed up: Lil' Flip, game over

[Hook]
I'm a stone cold guerrilla, it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - It’s in my DNA
I'm stackin' paper every day, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - it’s in my DNA
I just pour me up a Ace, it’s in my DNA
