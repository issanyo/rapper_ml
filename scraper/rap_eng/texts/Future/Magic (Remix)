[Intro: Future]
Pluto, Future
(K.E. on the Track) Hey!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Tell you off the top, I'm bossed up
You ain't talking money, don't talk to us
I'm steady stacking that guap up
Ball harder than you when I'm locked up
You the type of nigga that pop up
When niggas rolling that kush, huh?
Got mine growing like grapevines
In the backyard, come look, bruh
I pull up, hop out
Bad hoes just pop out
Hating niggas better watch out
Still riding with that Glock out
My style so mean til it's hostile
And aggressive dawg, come check your dawg
Spend a couple of mill, no stress at all
Big bankroll, no checks at all
FYI, I'm flexing y'all
Game A1 professional
You small ball like golf balls
I'm basketball, go ask your broad
Tell her legs open sesame
Abracadabra, she wet for me
Like ta-da, voila
Gucci, Louie, Stravers, Prada, ah!

[Hook: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic
Yoila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic

[Verse 2: Future]
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts, man I burned 'em up like Newports
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick, you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds, ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me, the greatest
AMG in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot, I'ma do a 180
For the haters, I'ma go ahead do a 360
Drinking on the Sprite, got lean all in it
I'm a astronaut nigga better church my pimping

[Hook: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic
Yoila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic

[Verse 3: Future]
Billionaire boy, that's true inspiration
I'm the astronaut kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherfucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Beemer out of Germany
Got a thing for me, don't want a thing from me
They like my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You'll reappear, no outta sight
I'm Pluto talking
Jimmy walking, when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I rose on Earth and now I'm sci-fi, voila
I stay high, my bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And crawl out in that new Porsche (skert!)

[Hook: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic
Yoila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
