[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
I might pull up to your job [?]
[?]
Uhh, your girl think I'm cool
I just got a mansion so they all got rooms
Do it for the tea-

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
[?]
I'm not fucking for feelings i'm fucking for yourself
[?]
I know [?]
I know [?]
You know I wanna [?] so keep your bonnet on
You know I wanna pull [?] so keep your bonnet on
I know [?] bonnet on
[?] please don't take long
