[Hook: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won
A trophy
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy

Everyday I be stalking your instagram
Hitting likes on the picture,baby this ain't no spam
You're my bestest friend
I just won me a trophy
Ever since you came into my life
I never get lonely
I just wanna go out with you
Dress you in Versache so you could get cozy
These people are jealous
I just wanna take you out to Venice
Get Careless
Baby drive you in a Bentley
Treat you gently cuz you're my lady
Cuz you're my lady
I just won me a trophy
God blessed me
Yeah,God blessed me
To all the haters,Rest in peace
I'll buy you all that niche

I just want me a trophy,Guess what?
I just won me a trophy
I've never seen anybody
These other girls standing next to you look like a potty
Damn,you're a hottie
Seeing you happy is my hobby
I love it when you get naughty
I just wanna say sorry
Come with me baby cuz everyday we are gonna party
Oh,we're gonna party
Let's get on this deck
And float to Abu Dhabi
I just wanna love you softly
Oh
So i could kill em' softly
Never seen nobody
