Astronomical you know, put in they face so they can see it

[Chorus: Future]
I can't wait till they see my neck showing off
I can't wait till they see my bitch showing off

[Verse 2: Future]
Yeah, ice real, yeah
Grills bigger than Holyfield
You can see the diamonds shining across the room, [?] clear
A xan and a half, I'm walking up on a Leer
The jewelry is mean, the watches is mean and niggas on lean
I'm whipping a B, yeah the one with the wing
Yeah, Tony Montana, I'm cranking the hammer like yeah yeah
You ain't gotta front me nothing, nigga I'm buying mine
I keep an exotic bitch sittin' on the sideline
Trap out the Wraith in the winter, I got a whole new dilemma
I fucked a hoe on a perc, now I can't even remember
I got a hoe and the swag, I got a hoe and the swag
I'm bought to bring out the bag, I'm bought to bring out the bag

[Chorus: Future]
I can't wait till they see my neck showing off
I can't wait till they see my bitch showing off
Woaahh (such a show off)
Ohhh (such a show off, show off)
I can't wait till they see my cop car
I can't wait till they see my squads shit
Ohhh (show off, show off, show off, showing off)
Woaahh (gang gang, throw it up, throw it up)
