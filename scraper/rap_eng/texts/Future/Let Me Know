[Chorus: Future]
Do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
When I'm lovin' your body, when I'm lovin' your body
Do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
When I'm lovin' your body, when I'm lovin' your body

[Verse 1: Tamar Braxton]
Do you feel it in your heart?
Do you feel it in your soul?
When you know when it's right
You don't let go, you don't let go

[Refrain: Tamar Braxton]
We've been through so many things
Ups and downs and in betweens
If you need more love from me
I'll give you more, just let me know

[Pre-Chorus: Tamar Braxton]
It's that good lovin', make you run and go tell somebody
Same love that put you through Hell sometimes (oh-whoah)
You don't give it up to nobody
When you love somebody, when you love somebody

[Chorus: Future]
Do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
When I'm lovin' your body, when I'm lovin' your body

[Verse 2: Tamar Braxton]
Now when he breaks your heart
Lie to your face when you know
When you cry and you cry and try
You try some more, you try some more

[Refrain: Tamar Braxton]
We've been through so many things
Ups and downs and in betweens
If you need more love from me
I'll give you more, just let me know

[Pre-Chorus: Tamar Braxton]
It's that good lovin', make you run and go tell somebody
Same love that put you through Hell sometimes (oh-whoah)
You don't give it up to nobody
When you love somebody, when you love somebody

[Chorus: Future]
Do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
Hey do you love the way I do when I'm lovin' your body
When I'm lovin' your body, when I'm lovin' your body

[Bridge: Tamar Braxton]

And so your kisses makin' sure of
And give it to you, get it good love
Turn the lights down, it's goin' down
And if you don't really like it fast
We can go deeper baby don't be scared
Love again and again and again

[Pre-Chorus: Tamar Braxton]
It's that good lovin', make you run and go tell somebody
Same love that put you through Hell sometimes (oh-whoah)
You don't give it up to nobody
When you love somebody, when you love somebody
It's that good lovin', make you run and go tell somebody
Same love that put you through Hell sometimes (oh-whoah)
You don't give it up to nobody
When you love somebody, when you love somebody

[Chorus: Future]
