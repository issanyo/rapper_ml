[Chorus]x2
Now I been smoking Arizona
Bad yellow bicth, I mean her skin tone is corona
I smoke, I drank, Im such a Stoner
I be so far gone just call me goner

[Flock Rock verse1]
They be like ahh man hold up
What you know about it bruh
Candy paint on 26's with the lean im pouring up
Got bout 10 redbones with fat asses and they down to fuck
Yeah, from the country where the B's andthe C's andthe G's
You know they throw it up
O.G.F.E in it, F.E.S.G run it
You know how flock rock
Top chop you know im gunning
Bitches fuckin with me, liqour steady pouring
Blunts getting rolled, puff pass,you know im blowing out
Yeah!! let me roll up, you know its about that time
Cuz them camaros about to show up
We walk in, straight thru the door
Nigga tell me whats the hold up
And im on some lean and weed
So when you approach me SLOW UP
My dreads swanging my chain hanging
So whats your issue
Findin a bad bicth to suck up and blow me like a whistle
Swagga so offical, chucks wit my levis
Polo on my chest like a vest
You should see I!!

[Chorus]x2

[J.Reed verse2]
MANNNN, i swear its been a long time
Where that cush pack, I swear it bong time
No more panties bitch, girls its thong time
She just call my dick, Mr. never wrong time
My flow is off the richter
And when i be scream cheese I ain't talking bout no picture
I eat her, I eat her, yeah I eat like hannibal lecter
Class in session get your lecture
I feel like Washington, im bout a dollar
Your bicth around my neck, so i call that bicth my collar
And if you smoke that LOUD, boy I smok that holla
And my shit hitting hard, Troy polamalu
.....she cacth my balls like patrick crayton
The way i raise hell, you should call me satan
I got the game sowed up, perfectly knitted
Three girls give me head, i call it snapback, skully, fitted
Get it??

[Chorus]x2

[Future verse3]
Im blowed, Im blowed, Im blowed
Im high Im smokin on dro
Im space cadet, Im george jetson
Im gone, Im on that double cup
Got two cups full of that Easter,and got more swagg than a preacher
And all my verses lethal
And im playin with that mona lisa
Im farragamo and fendi
Im supa future and Im winning
Im biting down and im gettin it
My cup keep lean in it
My niggas keep guns on them
And my bicthes keep bicthes with them
They geeked up of that marley
Keep beggin for me to get in them
I smoke more than a chimney, that loud,that loud,that loud
Im back stage getting groupie love, you can smell it all the way in the crowd
Promethazine my favorite, I mix it up with that sprite
I took me a pill and a half, Now I feel like Im outta sight
Im throwed, Im throwed, Im throwed
Im on syrup but i ain't movin to slow
I done took me a miley cyrus, now Im off in beast mode
Now i can't even talk, can damn near move my jaw
Im screwed up like, in Houston
And im flyer than a hawk

[Chorus]x2
