[Intro: Future]
It's that Project Baby
And we about fifteen up, you know what I mean?
They 'gon try take advantage of this money
Shit coming in fast
They know we ain't got a blueprint of this shit
We just came into this shit with it already

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
All I know, identity theft, I buried all the credit cards
G1 had me in the kitchen, sellin' hard and doin' fraud
Took me out the 'jects, now I'm flyin' private jets, nigga
'Member snatchin' chains, I got my own around my neck, nigga
I caught five kidnappin', but I ain't no babysitter
I caught five kidnappin', how you let me take your nigga?
Posted on the ugly, I jump out, go to bustin'
My baby mama dusty, got my little one out here musky
Skrrt, skrrt, pull up in a vert, call it a pullback, ayy
Pull up in a Wraith, they be like "Who is that"?
Pulling up in luxury, thank God, ain't no more strugglin'
I'm rollin' 'round, I be duffelin'
She under arrest, I'm cuffin' it

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I just beat the case, I'm ridin' in a double R
Spread the cheese with your people, gotta feed the squad
I bought my mama and my brothers, them another car
At first I was playin' with this shit, but now I'm goin' hard
It's like my baby mama feel like she the superstar
I threw away the Fossil watch and bought an Audemars
Was in the 'Yota, now I'm ridin' in the luxury car
I was off the chain, now a youngin' on the charts
I was ridin' Suzuki, ayy, now I'm actin' boujee, ayy
Now I'm coolin', foolin', I'm just 'bout my music
No more shootin' cee-lo, poppin' wheelies on the Banshee
Can't be thuggin' no more, homie, I stay in a mansion
I'm on mollys and the Xannies, feel extravagant
Took me off the ugly corner, I'm ridin' panoramic
You hate the way I'm transitionin', I'm corporate thugging
You miss when I was headfirst, when I wasn't gettin' no money

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case, yeah
