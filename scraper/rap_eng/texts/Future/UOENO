[Intro: Future]
UOENO it
Po high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit on me
You know what I’m saying?

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and UOENO it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and UOENO it
This a half a million dollar car, UOENO it
I came up from bottom, UOENO it
My niggas all ride with me on, UOENO it
Got killers with me right now, UOENO it
This a million dollar watch nigga, UOENO it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, UOENO it

[Verse One: Jernigan]
Shout out Future

I wrote this in jail and UOENO
The P still stands for Pale and UOENO it
OTS Tied For First and UOENO it
Bout to do a whole verse and not curse and UOENO it
Let's get it
Got a lot to say but I don't know how to say it
Take a shot at me and wanna win, you better pray it
All praise goes to the most high
Aerows, rep that crew til I die
In the O-Town I am the most lyrical
But if I had a hit record, that'd be a miracle
Y'all know how the mainstream work
Put ratchet hoes that got a mean twerk
Above actual poets
That's factual, we both know it
His mixtape seeing more delays than Detox
But if you take hits at Clip, see red dots
Not chicken pox
Y'all rappers acting stupid on the mic
I'm out the battle game but if you faggots want, then we can fight

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Jernigan]
I'm not a thug, I'm a nerd
My Little Pony bruh, Lupin III
But if it gotta happen, it gotta happen
I will get to scrapping, soon as a nigga get to yapping
Only with my fists cause I don't do no capping
Stunna home, our nigga out of jail
I promised y'all I'd be back and I didn't fail
Spydar gone, that ain't my problem
He fucked up his life, now he might as well sign with Rostrum
Me and Daz cool now
We beefed and squashed so many times, we acting like fools now
But that's life, bruh
Paper Stunnas Music, and I put that on my wife, bruh

[Hook]

[Jernigan}
UOENO it!
UOENO it!
UOENO it!
UOENO it!
UOENO it!
Y'all might know it
I don't know if y'all know it
I hope you ain't know it

[Bridge: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin', you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it

[Jernigan]
UOENO it, nigga!
P-Stunna
Paper Stunnas fucking Music, mayne
I noticed I'm starting to have emotion on the mic
Like I'm starting to get excited and shit
I like it
