[Intro]
I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
We do five star suites for no reason
Money, cars, clothes, these hoes for no reason
Yea let the endo burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Chorus]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?

[Verse 1]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Chorus]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know you broken hearted, [?] nothing hurt me
But I love right now it might hurt me
My VIP for these bad bitches and they on everything
They suckin' me and eatin' each other they with everything
My type of conversation money over everything
Get up on, get up on they lookin' out for you
Get up on, get up on they lookin' out for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Chorus]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?

[Outro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?
