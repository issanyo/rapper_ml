[Hook 1]
I got my jewelry on me right now
50 round carbine on me right now
Got 100 round drum on the seat right now
I got your bitch and she with me now
I had a sip on that codeine now
I like to pull up in Bentleys now
My goons get it done with a mac 11
My niggas gon' ride for the shit that we reppin'
Be cool on that fuck shit
And y'all on that fuck shit
We work that dope out the mud pit
We on that dope and that mud shit
We tryna show niggas some love shit

[Verse]
Niggas try to flex they muscles on us
We cut 'em off and bought some better choppas
We'll fuck you bitches, let my brother hit 'em
Fuck you niggas, let my robbers get 'em
They just wanna see me out my mental
Wanna fuck some commas up at my dealer
Fuckin' lumber up doin' numbers
Pop a molly up, I remember
Better put your Mrs. up Imma get her
Fuck her in the mouth, didn't kiss her
Gut the crib out with all pistols
I got my grill in, 20 thousand
For the few chains, that a new rari
I got this cute dame, give a fuck about her
She want all this fame and a million dollars
I done took this pain and I'm noddin' off
Keep a few rings, give a fuck about 'em
I'm in that new Range, give a fuck about it
Grippin' grain on the Mulsanne
Sippin' drank at the Blue Flame
Hit the booth, let the booth flame
We ain't never cool, we just say that shit
For this bitch, you gotta play my shit
Run it back and then say my shit

[Bridge]
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing it
I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over now
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
