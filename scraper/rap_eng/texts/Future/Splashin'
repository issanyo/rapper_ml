All about my check I need my cash, first
Boy stay out my lane before I smash, swerve
All this kush cologne on me I splash, squirt
800 a zone, I'm talkin' gas, work
All about my check I need my cash, first
Boy stay out my lane before I smash, swerve

[Verse 1-Mook]
I be takin' care of business, need my cash first
The weight man is my partna so we pass purp
We be chiefin' Sour Diesel, I rock GAP shirts
You mad as hell at me, you came in last first
I'm bout to trade the Vic and get a Jag, vert
Or money, diamonds on me, had to splash, squirt
Shawty you's a teardrop, seen that ass first
There's plenty women on me, I don't chase [?]
You niggas in my lane, I just mash, swerve
If they say they ain't been biting they got some nerve
But I don't worry bout em, I just bend, curve
And if you bout your money than just say 'word'

[Verse 2-Future]
Out in California, you can smell it on my shirt
800 dollars, on drink and on purp (loud)
I splash, I squirt, I splash, I squirt, I splash, I squirt (hold on)
Yeah, I make the bitches go berserk (turn up)
Yeah, all a nigga do is get money, drank syrup
All a nigga do is drop the bands and get it first
Astronaut persona man I'm never on Earth
All this pimpin' in my blood, I make the bitches say "church"
Church, and the smoke 800
He ain't bet a 100 with a pocket full of commas
You a slow learner, that's a pocket full of hundreds
[?] baby, hundreds smell like ganja

You collar bitin' niggas, man I should have bought a necklace (that right)

The pack come in, its gone again, yeah, we move it out like Tetris
You know I tax work, I cap first
I'm really talkin' [?], we just goin' swag surf
I keep that .40 on me, I blast, squirt
Nigga tryna rob me, see the casket first
I'm doing bout a 100 when I smash and swerve (skrtt)

[Verse 4-Lil Vee]
Lil Vee, what's up? Not much, leggo, leggo
I just sit back and observe, I don't say a word
If you come close to my lane you might just hit the curb (skrrt)
I been gettin' my caps in, I can't help but splurge
Sippin' 100 dollar lean, [?] on the search
Take it to another level cause I got the urge
Flyest nigga around like them dirty birds
You know we shut it down, like when you get off work
Just tell me what you want, my partners got the work
And even gas, 20 dollar fill up
I shoot craps, I made 5 bands off the [?]
Strikin' everyday, I can't help but come up
I should sign with Nike, gotta run that check up
