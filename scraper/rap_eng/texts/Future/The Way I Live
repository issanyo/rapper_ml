You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal
You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal

I know I'm an alien
I know I'm from another planet
I know I'm different
You know I look outstanding
I take over the flight and I don't care about landing
I'm bout to catching more gold
You know I love them pennies
I send'em from the bar
I'm causing major damage
Just like a transformer
I put my car in the help
I cause that noise
I put a house on the G put niggers on the G
I'm in the field with the greens
But I don't have on cleats
And that Versace my sheet
But I don't go to sleep
How they know all the Ralph but they speak
Up for this

You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal
You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal

I know I'm an alien
I know I'm from another planet
I just know I'm form another planet
Dominate pushing weight
Congratulate gang cake start racing
First base pushing
Just a country ass nigga
In the middle of Vegas
I'm a pimp I'm a player
I'm a man like Tony I got Rollie I got lean
I'm not slowing cause I'm moving like nobody
Got girl from college on my sweet they bought it
And this car...cause it's that Americano...
I just woke her like this like a shoot for a photo

You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal
You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal

I know I'm an alien
I know I'm from another planet
I just know I'm form another planet
Prada, Prada, Chanel, Gucci, Audi
And I got Hermes Givenchy I hold it all at once
I out you hurt to the slurp
I hear it on the...
The penthouse into my 20
I'm in that Rari I'm sketching
I'm trying to pop a Willie
Oversee my vision
Drinking champagne on an yacht
There's millions in the business
And I'm like keeping it real
I'm keeping it on trigger
I bought a mansion in Callie I can't even spend a 50

You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal
You couldn't understand the way I live
Cause I don't stand the way I live
It's not normal the way I live
This lifestyle is unreal
