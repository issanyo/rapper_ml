[Verse 1: Future]
My mama said fuck it, nigga, hit the streets and live
Got some crack in the corner and I did what I did
The neighbors they don't like me, I got J's at the door
Told my grandma I don't need a bed, I'm sleeping on the floor
Got my tool and my blow, they my two main hoes
Me and all my woes stick together like the Zoes
Stop by, say "who got the yay for the low"
And I keep birds with me like I'm straight out Hollygrove

[Hook: Future]
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got that calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Million dollars cash, count it all by myself
She say "Baby let me help you", I say "Bitch don't need your help"
If it's one thing that a nigga don't do, it's trust
If there’s tops on the cars tell you bitch it wasn’t us
40 million dollar mansion
Master bedroom in the kitchen
Scarface got you in the living room now this living
I’m Michael Jordan in his prime and these niggas Scottie Pippen
Trying to out-ball MJ Scottie trippin
Think I’m bout to put a helipad on my roof
Then spit a brick and a half in the booth
Put my tax on 'em when I send 'em out of state
While they call you Weight Watchers?
Cuz we be watching all the weight

[Hook: Future]
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got that calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I get that itch, having me scratch my head
Thinkin' bout my nigga that just got snatched by the feds
Gun under the pillow, they might try to catch me in bed
I don’t cuddle with these bitches cause I hold my ratchet instead
I’m in love (you in love with)
With cashin' out at them counters
Thumbing through that money
Swim fast as them counters
Them haters don’t win jazz, but they ain’t ready for counters
Big nigga at your door house, look like he got bouncers
I ain’t lying, (I ain’t lying)
My money’s mandatory
I ain’t got no game bitch, just understand my story (nice)
Tell me time is money so if we can spend together
When they ask when I’m free, I tell them bitches never

[Hook: Future]
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got that calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

[Verse 4: Yo Gotti]
[?] met my plug, he was down with BMF
He front me what I [?] the last plug left
I'm itchin, I'm itchin, I'm itchin for that sack
[?] where I go, street niggas asked me where it's at
But it's dry and hot like a motherfucking desert
36 O's you get
Trigger finger itchin, got it locked on my Beretta
And I don't let these rats try to take a nigga federal
My bitch in [?], she doing 650
On I-55, where she make [?]
Try to thumb through the check, finger itchin like the chicken pork
I-Phone and my digiscale, kitchen with the chicken pot

[Hook: Future]
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got that calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper

My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
My fingers, they itchin, they itchin for that paper
I'm riding around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a motherfucking monster when it come to getting that paper
