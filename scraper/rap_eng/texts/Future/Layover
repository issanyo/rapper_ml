[Intro]
Caesar Lee
Yeah
Two sides to every story
Hendrix
Shawty where you been these days?
Shawty where you been these days?

[Chorus]
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
Keep some pretty shit at the condo
Got some thick shit on the bed with her legs open
Bitch came through for a few, that's a layover
Bitch came through for a hour, that's a layover
What you been doin'? I been chillin' at the crib, poolside with some pretty-pretty bitches tryna get a tan
Had some Chinese freaks come over to the crib last night just to fuck, [?]
Had them Chinese freaks come over, tried molly, now they wanna ask Shoota "Do we got them xans?"
Tell me you don't want no parts with this
Tell me you don't want no parts in this
Tell me your heart ain't in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit
Your heart ain't gotta be in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit

[Verse]
I'ma flood some ice on both of my wrists
I'ma flood that ice on both of my wrists
Baby came over, she a new vibe
Baby came over, she a new vibe
Tell me that you ready for the turn up right now like me, just like me
Don't tell me that I fuck you so good, you don't wanna leave, you don't wanna leave
Got a case of Hennessy in the fridge on chill for you
You need to call up some more girls, tryna feel on you
Pretty girls they in my collection, baby don't get caught out there flexin'
And you got that Birk' on your shoulder, and I got them racks, won't fold up
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't go nowhere and they don't know us
You ain't for them lights and the cameras when I roll up
So I fuck your main thing to keep her composure
Rollin' up dodie, and I'm gone off soda
Don't I keep that red drink with me like Piru?
Then I put them solitaries in it, go to Caicos
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Christian Louboutins on your feet when you stand up
Now I'm gettin' fed up, cause tryna bed fuck
Actin' like a nigga don't know she bout a dollar
Actin' like nigga ain't got no models
I'll fuck a pop star at this time here tomorrow
These girls walk around, these strip clubs ours
Goin' out the country, get that dirty money, gotta watch who did the laundry
I gotta get it rainstorm, sleet, or sunny
I gotta chase this mofuckin' money

[Chorus]
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
Keep some pretty shit at the condo
Got some thick shit on the bed with her legs open
Bitch came through for a few, that's a layover
Bitch came through for an hour, that's a layover
What you been doing? I been chillin' at the crib, poolside with some pretty-pretty bitches tryna get a tan
Had some Chinese freaks come over to the crib last night just to fuck, [?]
Had them Chinese freaks come over, tried molly, now they wanna ask Shoota "Do we got them xans?"
Tell me you don't want no parts with this
Tell me you don't want no parts in this
Tell me your heart ain't in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit
Your heart ain't gotta be in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit
