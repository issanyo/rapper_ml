[Hook: Casino]
Tattoo on my bitch body, I'm draped in all versace
Fourteen pound around my neck, I had to match my watches
Move so many bricks a month, the fed the tryna stop me
Try to throw a murder on me, I had to throw it up
My neck is full of diamond chains
I went to throw it up
Got cubans on my rich neck, I went to throw it up
Rings on my finger, I had to light em up
That Cheville for a truck
It can't lift it up
My bitch is blunt headed
Coupe and rest furgated
Kill you and bring you back to life, like you Maccavelli
Mobbin [?]
...
Cool in here
They kissing fucking never telling, they never telling, kissing and fucking
Give her percosets she ready (give her perc she ready)
Chain heavy, it won't perc eleven (Fre.. good lord)
All I need is a cruise ship
All these Freebandz I can fucking disappear
Jump a private then I'm out of here
My men are draped in all Versace (good lord)
My neck my wrist it runs like faucet (tattoo, water)
Tattoo on my bitch body, I'm draped in all versace
Fourteen pound around my neck, I had to match my watches
Move so many bricks a month, the fed the tryna stop me
Try to throw a murder on me, I had to throw it up
My neck is full of diamond chains
I went to throw it up
Got cubans on my rich neck, I went to throw it up
Rings on my finger, I had to light em up
That Cheville for a truck
It can't lift it up

[Verse 2: Future]
I caught a player of the cash apps
I'm worth like Benz, glass trap
Give her the percs, she got bad mouth
Bad is good when I'm around
Gripping ...  a hunnid pounds, drop that fat I ain't coming down
I got the bread it ain't coming down
I see them jog at the kid, all the way down
I put the racks in a bitch face (*bird sounds* pass em out)
I had a [?] at new year, they were cashing out
I got my watch draped up, yeah I went and iced it out
I brought a mil some dollar, I'm getting head from some real bad mother
I brought a fire-end on my guys, damn near million dollars
Put your opinions on the tools, running around way overdue
Throw the racks in the tub, I made myself a plug

[Chorus]
