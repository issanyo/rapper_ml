[Intro: Lil Durk]
Ride the fuckin' wave

[Hook: Lil Durk & Future]
I be tired of these niggas tryna ride the fuckin' wave
I done put some niggas on they feet around the way
I done put some millions in the trap around the way
I done did so much I make 'em feel some type of way
I want it all, I want it all
For me and my dogs, so we can ball
You see this drip, it's drippin' on me
You see this clip, it's hangin' on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me

[Verse 1: Future]
I run the check through machines now
I ride around with machine guns
I put a check on a ching chong
Hold up, lil nigga, I'm King Kong
I go to sleep with the hammer
Fuck watchin' the TV, I'm watchin' the camera
I'm paranoid higher than a hawk
You broke and it ain't my fault
I need it all, I told ya dog, I been 'round the atlas
I'm gutta forever, I fuck on a thot, then go fuck an actress
Let me find out you been lyin' 'bout all the shit you say in your raps
I put the hood on the map
I put the hood on the map
My young nigga just caught a double
They tryna give him the chair
They tryna give him the chair

[Hook: Lil Durk & Future]
I be tired of these niggas tryna ride the fuckin' wave
I done put some niggas on they feet around the way
I done put some millions in the trap around the way
I done did so much I make 'em feel some type of way
I want it all, I want it all
For me and my dogs, so we can ball
You see this drip, it's drippin' on me
You see this clip, it's hangin' on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Block nigga, war time, keep a Glock wit 'em
Future Biggie, I'm Pac, nigga
Drop a bar in the pop, nigga
Appeal money free oak, nigga
I love designer, no rap, nigga
Diamond water like tap, nigga
Feds listen, they tap, nigga
No green just act, nigga
Never got shot, but I put that pole to work
Chopper got a kick back and I hope it's sure to work
Young killas 15 and you know I mold 'em first
Free 22, 38, the state had told 'em first
Spot 'em, got 'em, yeah yeah
I'm a problem, yeah yeah
It's my city, hell yeah
And my killers playin' here
