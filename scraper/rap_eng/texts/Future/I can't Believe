[Hook x2]
I’m moving on, I’m moving on
I can’t believe how many times she called my phone
I can’t believe how many times I did her wrong
I can’t believe how many times I did her wrong

[Verse 1]
I keep it interesting
For her, it’s no finessing
She love my style so when she shop, she let me do the dressing
She shoulda learned her lesson, fucking with me is a blessing
Infatuated with my presence, now she feel neglected
I bought her so many presents, it’s one to break there
She been a1 with a nigga since the first day
Just to pack it, she gon’ pack it in her purse
I got her jewels, she ’bout to pull up with that work

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I tried to make up for it, put her in a Beamer
I bought that bitch a crib, been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
A gift and a curse when you’re fucking with a hustler
She know I got a curse, she just want me to fuck her
And you still hurt me when I lie to her
I can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her
Can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her

[Hook x2]
