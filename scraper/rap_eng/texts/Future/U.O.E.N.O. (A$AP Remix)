[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don't like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can't even mow it
Sip Dom Perri', little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain't P.J., no Rose from me ho, so don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
AP and that PK, wear a Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon' show it 'til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game fuckin' floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
Been rich for 'bout a year now, you ain't even know it
Had a long talk with my accountant, I ain't even blew it
The whole game bit my shit, you ain't even know it
A$AP on the remix, you ain't even know it
I say these niggas, need lord - got a crib they can't even afford
In the club lookin' all boredm show 'em your money, you ain't even throw it
And that crib you don't even own it, that lean, you ain't even pour it
Every bad bitch dream about my dick, you ain't even know it
She poppin' and droppin' it lower, droppin' it down to the floor
Give you the feeling it's yours, open you, score, you ain't even know her
She asked about my journey as she sat upon my lap
I said "I'm fresh up out the slums but I ain't never going back"
You ain't know?

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 3: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin', you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it
