I ain't got a label i'm independent
Me and mamma summa love we independent
I ain't got a boss on this label he very dependent
I sold the bricks to feed my dependence
This life i'm depicting i'm really living
I get a hundred percent not no pennies
I'm in the trap we're blowing white pennies
If you not a hundred you not at all
I popped the seal and I drank it all
I rolled it up and I smoked it all
I found a borne and I buy it all
Where im from ain't no hope at all
He not a hundred he not all
He not a hundred he lying yall
[Verse 1: Future]
If they see a kilo they'd probably get nervous
I took a bill and I made myself flourish
Look at lil mama her body so perfect
Just like a candle we take the money and burn it
Its different for us we had to go and earn it
I stay away I see them niggas lurking
I stay away I see them niggas lurking
I stay away I see them niggas skin
[Verse 2: Future]
Ran on the bed but I thought I was dreaming
That money dirty so I gotta clean it
That money filthy so i gotta wash it
Can't let a pussy nigga 'round my pocket
Can't let a sucker nigga come and stop it
Can't let a hating nigga come and pop me
[Verse 3: Future]
Hoes taking pictures they love me
Niggas I grew up with ain't that funny
I ain't ever gone change for the money and i'll never let you come and take it from me
[Verse 4: Future]
Fans lock me up ask was it worth it
I looked at them and said dam right its worth it
I hear the more I smile i'm earthly
Up early trappin' when them birds are chirping
I ride around and i'm servin
I close a lil niggas curtains
[Hook]
Ain't got a label im independent
Me and momma summa love we independent
Ain't got a boss on this label he independent
I sold the britches to feed my dependence
This life i'm depicting i'm really living
I get a hundred percent not no pennies
I'm in the trap we're blowing white pennies
If you not a hundred you not at all
I popped the seal and I drank it all
I rolled it up and I smoked it all
I found a brone and I buy it all
Where im from ain't no hope at all
He not a hundred he not all
He not a hundred he lying yall
[Verse 5: Future]
He not a hundred ya feel
I'm rocking Louboutin Christian
I'm counting dead people watching television
Somebody stealing this 20 gram
And when I catch him imma cut off his hand
[Verse 6: Future]
Come get some work and join the clan
You need some work come see the man
Come here lil shawty come fuck the man
How he a boss with a c.e.o
He not a O.G he just a hoe
[Verse 7: Future]
No he not real he a facade
He wear that real nigga camouflage
He got that street nigga starter kit
If i start it imma finish it
[Verse 8: Future]
I see the judge give my nigga forty
They just gaveled and sentenced him
We the shit nigga where you been
We let a 18 wheeler burn the men
I seen the Feds take my partner in, then they gathered around and rubbed it in
If he could've done it all again we'dve seen the wall and followed him in
Always working never calling in
Always working never calling in
