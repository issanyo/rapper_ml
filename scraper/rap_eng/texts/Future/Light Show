[Intro: Future]
Tarantino with me
Lights!
YFBG, nigga
Every time we step out

[Chorus: Future]
Light show, light it up!
Light show, light it up!
Light show, light it up!
Light show, light it up!
When I step out, light show
My neck, my wrist, it'll glow
Cartiers up to my elbows
Crushed ice, nigga, night glow
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
When I step out, neck glow
When I pop out, UFO
Ear, ring, melee
Shoot 'em with the Draco, a AK
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
When I step out, light glow
Lit, froze, whoa, whoa
Wrist real cocoa
Pinky ring, white show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show
Light it up! Light show

[Verse 1: Guap Tarantino]
My wrist mean, light show
I'm goin' green, Geico
A murder scene, might go
Pretty thing, thot hoe
I got big rocks
I'm goin' big clocks
I fucked up big top
She gave me big top
Wrap a nigga no no pop
Taliban sold that rock
Gucci tag down to my sock
[?] damn J's on top
Look like 10 big rocks
I might go fuck on my side hoe
Diamonds on my neck, that light show
Shinin' in the dark, that night glow
Pluto out here servin' on white hoes (Pluto)
Let her off the leash, she like to fight hoes
Ain't no IDs at the night shows
Packin' the team on the right hoe
Fuckin' on the team with the mic on
[?], right toe

Real diamonds on me no light zone

[Chorus: Future]
Light show, light it up!
Light show, light it up!

When I step out, neck glow
When I pop out, UFO

Young nigga pulled up wit' a stick
Keep a camera roll outta his wig
Got a blizzard sittin' on my wrist
