[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
This for the hood rich and the homeless
Zone 1 to Zone 6
Rent to own or own your own shit
On the pole, bitch, or you on dick
For them dope boys with them Chevys on them 6s
For the college girls that gotta shake titties
Gotta grade it baby
Got a hundred majors
I speak for you cause who else will
[?]
I've been pissed off since New Years
My [?]
2 room on [?]
To skyview in my new crib
Southside, we out here
Fuck nigga

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
All I rock is polo, dollar sign my logo

[Hook: Waka Flocka]
I’m so fuckin' turnt up with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and the drug dealers
I’m so fuckin' turnt up, with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and the drug dealers

[Verse 4: Yo Gotti]
I’m turnt up, hood shit, real nigga, hood rich
Bad bitches only, but she must be a hood bitch
I’m riding round in your city, strapped up and I’m gettin it
Lambo, NASCAR, loud pipes and I’m in it
Top down, my chain on, you a real nigga that’s the same song
Glock 40 my aim on, little fuck boy, you a lame ho
I’m turnt up, can’t turn me down
I’m sacked up and I’m on the town
Her head fire come, burn me down, and you know the sound

[Verse 5: Gucci Mane]
It's hood rich radio, you bet' not change the station
It’s Gucci Mane La Flare they say I changed the nation
I’m a trapper slash rapper yea that’s my occupation
And I don’t cary chump change all I do is carry faces
I’m an ath-e-lete, I ball, I think I’m Dominique
Primetime like Dion, I make them kiss my cleats
I brought you juice, I brought you flock, Now who's the next blow?
I’m so Bouldercrest, so Texaco, so Gresham Road
