[Intro]
Ready for whatever
Clever as it get
Do I really gotta explain myself?
Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-William

[Chorus]
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though
Ain't no givin' up, you already know how I give it up
Sippin' out the coffee cup, my Presidential face a hockey puck
Feed me dope, I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court (Yeah)
Skip to my lou (Skrrt), trappin' a sport (Skip to my lou)
Okay, fish butter, chicken cutter (Okay)
Maserati, we get mozzarella, yeah (Okay)
Go'n, you doin' that wrong (Out of here), Al Capone (Skrrt, skrrt)
Don't talk on phones 'cause we gettin' dope money all night long (Brrt)

[Verse]
I need, Chinese molly, Hong Kong (Brrt)
I need, good drank, big strong (Brrt)
Durdo call me Big Papi, I get big cocky (Brrt)
Uh-oh, big molly, got my wrist rocky (Uh-oh)
Uh-oh, bring the money on a big dolly (Uh-oh)
They know, I'm a millionaire from freestyling
Uh-oh, good dope make my wrist talk (Uh-oh)
Coco, watch me hit her with a big fork (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Toto, keep the receipt, I'm a bad boy (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Thirty round drip, ooh, he a mad boy (Woo)
All of my diamonds clear, ooh, that's a Jag, boy (Woo)
I see Hermes spelt out on my tag, boy (Woo)
I was hustlin' in the field with all I had, boy (Whoa whoa)
My mama shed a few tears but I wasn't sad, boy (Whoa whoa)
Tried to explain to her for years, she had a cash boy (Whoa whoa)
I took a pill and a half today, that ain't my last, boy (Whoa)
The one with the wings on it, I'm takin' off like Elroy
I took a P on the head, hey, I got the B on my head
I'm livin' close to the edge, I gotta stay with some lead
I wanna hit me a lick, just so I can sleep on the bed

[Chorus]
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though (Foreign)
Ain't no givin' up, you already know how I give it up (Pluto)
Sippin' out the coffee cup (Pluto), my Presidential face a hockey puck
I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court (Yeah)
Skip to my lou (Skrrt), trappin' a sport (Skip to my lou)
Okay, fish butter, chicken cutter (Okay)
Maserati, we get mozzarella, yeah (Okay)
Go'n, you doin' that wrong (Out of here), Al Capone (Skrrt, skrrt)
Don't talk on phones 'cause we gettin' dope money all night long
