[Pre-Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Verse 1]
Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Post-Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless

[Verse 2]
Let 'em hear the exhaust, show 'em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep the Draco
Bust a nigga; Tadoe
Runnin' up my pesos
Runnin' up my cake though
14 carat gold, I'm a motherfuckin' ruler
Upper echelon, you my motherfuckin' student

[Bridge]
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin is comin', it's comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Outro]
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd
