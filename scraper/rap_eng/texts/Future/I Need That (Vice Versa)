Yeah
Yeah, yeah, let em know...
Uhh
Man its the same shit but a different day
Man let me get this off my chest cause I ain't liftin' weights
I'm spittin' cray, but hope my brother find a different way
To chase this money, will we make it? thats a myste-ray
I'm pissed today
Found out some shit that got my temper hot
These niggas fake just keep it real, is you a friend or not?
Pretenders got me fuckin' mad and so I spend a lot
Cause blowin' paper seem to stimulate that tender spot
These men are not no competition dawg I roll alone
And shawty beggin' so I gotta let her tour the home
But if she wanna be my the queen she gotta hold the thrown
And understand that I ain't bussin' off of oral alone, take off that thong

I need that vice versa
Yeah yeah this be that vice versa
Yeah yeah you know that vice versa
Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya
This be that vice versa
Uhh, uhh this be that vice versa
This be that vice versa
Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya

See I ain't stoppin' til my life stops
You see these white socks
Probably turnin' negro as I'm runnin' from these white cops
Who want me in that ice box
But fuck them pigs, all they wanna do is beef
Them boys ain't nothin' but some live stock

Yeah yeah
See that's the shit I'm on
Somethin like my weed, cause every time she let me hit I'm gone
Yeah yeah
I keep the pen ablaze
Quarters bein' flipped but heads and tails and the endin' phase

Vice versa
Yeah yeah, you know that vice versa
Yeah yeah, this be that vice versa
Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya
You know that vice versa
Yea hmm, this be that vice versa
Haaah, yeah this be that vice versa
So if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya
