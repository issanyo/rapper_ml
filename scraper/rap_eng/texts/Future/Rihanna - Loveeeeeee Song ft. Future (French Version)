[Intro: Future]
Ain't nothing wrong with it

[Refrain: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L.O.V.E and affection

[Couplet 1: Rihanna]
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want
Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name boy
Let me know I'm in the control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I-I-I won't play around
I-I-I wanna lay you down
I-I-I need you now, I need you now

[Refrain: Future]

[Couplet 2: Rihanna]
Boy lately you been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want so come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
Cause a nigga might push upon it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now, I want you now
Oh Oh

[Refrain: Future]

[Pont: Future]
Can you love me for poor
I'm searchin' for my soul
Whoever turned you cold
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I work it physical
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart breathing through my clothes
Future...

[Refrain: Rihanna & Future]
