[Intro: Future]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
3 or 4 bitches on me
I just lost count on them Xannys hoe
I just lost count, I got drank on me
The money come and it goes
You know how that shit goes
Hendrix

[Verse 1: 550]
I’m back to the [?]
3 to 4 bitches and diamonds
I’m getting this money from rhyming
I’m back on my shit that was timeless
We land on the [?]
Still trapping the weed and the white
I’m back on the Xans and the lean
I buy this bitch brand new Céline
Fuck a new bitch every night
Run through your bitch if she right
I stood on the corners with packs
[?]
The motor it came in the back
The choppers is on the frontseat
Niggas want some we got heat
We rob on the beef ain’t no sleep
All of these diamonds they’ cold
My niggas they stick to the code
We passing these bitches, they hoes
They fucking for money and clothes

[?]
Most of these niggas were frauds
And I still think about her

[Hook: 550]
Shine in the dark like a light
I know that my future were bright
3 to 4 bitches a night
Ain’t taking the packages life
I know that I’m all ‘bout the height
We racing for money and fight
Straight out the jug’ to the mice
I ride with my niggas we ride
I ride with my niggas we ride
They down with my niggas for life
3-3 to 4 bitches a night
These diamonds they shine like a light

[Verse 2: Future]
Hold up, ay

[Hook: 550]
Shine in the dark like a light
I know that my future were bright
3 to 4 bitches a night

I know that I’m all ‘bout the height
We racing for money and fight
Straight out the jug’ to the mice

I ride with my niggas we ride
They down with my niggas for life
3-3 to 4 bitches a night
These diamonds they shine like a light
