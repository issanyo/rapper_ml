[Intro]
Step on the scene, forget about it
I put up racks, forget about it

[Chorus]
Why you hatin'? Why you hatin'? Oh, I'm fresh (Why you hatin'?)
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I'm fresh (Oh, I'm fresh)
I just popped open a seal, I'm on X (Poppin' a seal)
Lil shawty sittin' at the Blue Flame, sent me a text (Lil shawty)
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super)
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land (Super)
I float off Earth, always float off Earth (Hold up)
Diamonds doin' the Chris Breezy, oh

[Verse 1]
She comin' through in the wee wee hours
Went to the Hawks game in a helicopter
Said, "I want me a white bitch" and I copped her
Future high demand, Future high demand
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land
George Jetson, you can't see me, no
Do numbers like Boston George on Vimeo
I left that bitch 'cause she was sleazy, oh
You can't be sadity and greedy, no
I hid some money and I got plenty mo'
Stashed in the walls, stashed it in the floors
I dig a grave and bought a tombstone for the money
Stuffed a casket full of faces, got a tombstone for the money
Bought a foreign and a spaceship, bought a tombstone for my money

[Chorus]
Why you hatin'? Why you hatin'? Oh, I'm fresh (Why you hatin'?)
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I'm fresh (Oh, I'm fresh)
I just popped open a seal, I'm on X (Poppin' a seal)
Lil shawty sittin' at the Blue Flame, sent me a text (Lil shawty)
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super)
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land (Super)
I float off Earth, always float off Earth (Hold up)
Diamonds doin' the Chris Breezy, oh

[Verse 2]
She ain't runnin' out of flavor, I went to ice her
My number one bitch with me, it excite her
Let my shit go, blow the bitch, go to the cypher
That type of pussy, it's gon' make you want to wife her
We do a whole lotta numbers, yeah
Grab on that pussy like Donald
Porsche got a lil bitty trunk
But itâ€™s goin' over 200
Turtlenecks all on my collar
Love when a pretty bitch swallow
I did it up, gravity
Super so radically
Awesome, gnarly, woo!
Heavenly, rapidly, got killers on McAfee
I do it immaculately
I'm all in her mouth like a cavity
Cold as the polar, I keep it precise
I go to space in the middle of the night
I gotta talk with that pipe in my hand now
It could be a threat or a fan now
I can't get caught with my hands down
I can't be comin', my man's down
I put some bodies up underground
That's a few millions up underground
Murder for money, that's man down
Kill more than police across town
Bet not get caught with your hand down
Bet not get caught with your hand down

[Chorus]
Why you hatin'? Why you hatin'? Oh, I'm fresh (Why you hatin'?)
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I'm fresh (Oh, I'm fresh)
I just popped open a seal, I'm on X (Poppin' a seal)
Lil shawty sittin' at the Blue Flame, sent me a text (Lil shawty)
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super)
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land (Super)
I float off Earth, always float off Earth (Hold up)
Diamonds doin' the Chris Breezy, oh

[Outro]
Super Fu'
Super Fu'
Super Fu'
Super Fu'
