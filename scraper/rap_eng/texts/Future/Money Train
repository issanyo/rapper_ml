[Intro: Gunna & Future]
Wheezy beats
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Gunna]
Got nothing but hundreds on my membrane (hundreds on my membrane)
I can't be broke, I might go insane
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne
Swear it won't stop, we on the money train
Went overseas, I had a foreign exchange
I'm smokin' trees, California strain (California strain)
Two tennis necklace, these ain't PF Chang's (PF Chang's)

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Future]
16 foreign cars, I ain't nothin but 26 (26)
They snatched me up, I said I was innocent (innocent)
Fuck them cops tryna take my slime in (slime in)
Seven black whips, you don't know what I'm slidin' in (slidin' in)
My money way taller than my ceilings, yeah (ceilings, yeah)
Old school Murcielago ain't come from Craigslist (Craigslist)
Brand new Aventador, I chopped the head off (head off)
20 new tennis chains, Elliante (Elliante)
Pull up, perfect ten, 'bout my pesos (pesos)
Gotta stay gassed up like Valero (Valero)
Oh oh nah nah nah nah big talk red hoe (red hoe)
And she do whatever when I say so (say so, oh)
Pay the judge off to get the case closed (case closed)

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, got nothing but hundreds on my membrane (hundreds on my membrane)
I can't be broke I might go insane (I might go insane)
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne (I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne)
Swear it won't stop we on the money train (we on the money train)
Went overseas I had a foreign exchange (I had a foreign exchange)
I'm smokin' trees, California strain (California strain)
Two tennis necklace these ain't PF Chang's (PF Chang's)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
No surfboard, these nigga riding our wave
I put the hood on my shoulder blade (the hood on my shoulder)
Yves Saint Laurent, lil bitch you know we paid (Yves Saint Laurent, YSL)
Bought some more icing, don't need no more cake
I popped a perc, it healed my headache (I popped a perc, it healed my headache)
2-door Rolls Royce, still got leg space (2-door Rolls Royce, this bitch got leg space)
Show no remorse, we killing everything (Show no remorse, I'm killing everything)
SlimeLife came with that FreeBandz Gang (SlimeLife came with that FreeBandz Gang)

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, got nothing but hundreds on my membrane (on my membrane)
I can't be broke, I might go insane (I might go insane)
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne (I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne)
Swear it won't stop, we on the money train (on the money train)
Went overseas, I had a foreign exchange (I had a foreign exchange)
