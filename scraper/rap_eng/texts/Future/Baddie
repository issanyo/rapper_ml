(Verse)

Drip Drip with a check on me
One chain thats a flex on me
Bad bitch finna check on her
More juice won't never hurt

Diamonds so big your finger gon hurt
Surf make a nigga float off earth
They ain't know my grind
All they see is my shine

Fully low yea, put it in drive and go yea
Money and war yea
We put a load in the floors yea

Ran out the room to hide it
Its hard to find it
She know clue the flyest

You know damn well my drip ain't like these niggas
You can't be treating me like that
You know damn well keep a check on me
Dont make me have to go back in my bag
