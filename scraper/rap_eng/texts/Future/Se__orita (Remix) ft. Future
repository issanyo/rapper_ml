[Chorus ft.Future]
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get- x2


[Verse 1]
Keep it a hunna
This niggas stay frontin
Cut the check or its yo throat ill be cutting
Cutthroat Also  known to fuck up yo function
Got deers in the headlights I'm always head hunting
Like gthat
Niggas know I  Never leave home without the strap
If it not a nut then I'm prolly busting caps
Oh word yo  Thats yo lady lover in my lap   finna hit it quick then ill pass her back
Finna hit a lick real quick flip a stack
Fuck niggas better back Back
Fore they fuck around amd get  smacked With my mac
Gotta chill fore the opps  throw me back up max
Kill the beat then kill em in the streets like brthat
Use to move kilos in the backpack
Hope you niggas trip next time you backtrack
Already know who itbe when they see the snap back

[Chorus ft.Future]
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get- x2

[Verse 2]
Ay
Keep it two hunna y'all can't keep it 50
Keep it a buck or you ain't riding with me
Get away on the highway doing sixty
Watch what you say got shooters in you city
They strapped
I'm really with the shits while you niggas just rap
Type a nigga who can put the city on the map
Whip it in the kitchen I was  chilling in the trap
Sandman catch a nigga tripping while he naps
Cock it back hit with the double tap
Make sure that they ain't coming back  Lay it down with the axe
Always on the grind never lack
You can get it anywhere in the streets or on wax
.fuck a sixteen My clip longer then a limousine
Hold more the 18
Make yo crib  a murder scene
Burgundy
Be a minute for thet murder me
Bounce back then dip after the surgery
Yo

[Chorus ft.Future]
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper

[Verse 3]
Keep it 300 these  these niggas ain't nothing
Talk shit but running when they see me coming
Laugh at that fugazi diamonds they fronting
Don't hit me up less you talking bout hundreds
Or racks
If Dom spitting you already know that it  shit slaps
Snap every time  that I  rhyme on the track
Bitch niggas spitting lies act like its facts
Imma just lean back and stack these greenbacks
Poppin xannies raiding panties
In yo pantry //   in yo anty
They  can't stand me Can't command me
Understand me
Underestimate so  ill decapitate
Bet this clip ll make a snitch keep his shit shut
If a nigga got a problem then Somebody  getting cut
Catch a body with the shotty  pussies better duck
Cause if I'm coming at you it  ain't with a lil pump
Punk

[Chorus ft.Future]
