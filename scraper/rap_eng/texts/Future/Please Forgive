[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
Please, Lord, forgive us in this world of sinners
For they know not what they do
They know not what they do

[Hook: Sean Garrett & Crystal Nicole]
We will never know the day we goin' to leave this earth
Therefore we must live out our days for all their worth
If we've ever needed you Lord
Oh, we need you now
There's too much pain and sorrow for right now

[Verse: Lecrae]
I wonder why they hate us
Sometimes wonder why you made us
On hiatus from these haters
Plus I know why they want to slave us
Engraving angels on my grave
The strong survive, is what they say
But I look around, and all the stronger die
That's the reason why I pray
My head bow, tears to drown out the pain
Innocent bodies are slain
That's how you feel
When your color get you killed
Lord, I know this ain't your way
Why do the good die young
Got they momma crying for 'em
Gotta us writing them the poems
Reciting all the Psalms, Lord

[Hook: Sean Garrett & Crystal Nicole]
We will never know the day we goin' to leave this earth
Therefore we must live out our days for all their worth
If we've ever needed you Lord
Oh, we need you now
There's too much pain and sorrow for right now

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
Please, Lord, forgive us in this world of sinners
For they know not what they do
They know not what they do
Please, Lord, forgive us in this world of sinners
For they know not what they do
They know not what they do
Please, Lord, forgive us in this world of sinners
For they know not what they do
They know not what they do
