[Intro: Trap-A-Holics]
Zaytoven
Trap-A-Holics, real trap shit
Freebandz got all them foreign cars up in the driveway
Man this shit like a dealership out here
DJ Trap-A-Holic pick one

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Life sentence, life sentence
I hate to see a nigga get a life sentence
In the streets, there's consequences
Them bricks'll get you life, nigga
Damn son, where'd ya find this?

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Seen a nigga get life for a fingerprint
Another nigga get life with no evidence
What the fuck is going on in this shystie world
A nigga turn you in just to fuck your girl
Real trap shit
Trust me, I done seen it and been through it all
I pray to God that I'll never see the prison walls
I got a lot of niggas behind them prison walls
A couple of murder charges, judge throwed them all
Hit him with it twice, so after he serve that first L
Judge turned around, and do another life
The streets, whats going on out here?
I just know somethings wrong out here
Be careful, nigga

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Life sentence, life sentence
I hate to see a nigga get a life sentence
In the streets, there's consequences
Them bricks'll get you life, nigga

[Verse 2: Future]
Them brick'll get you life, nigga
Trap-A-Holics, turn up
Bodies on bodies, mollies on mollies
Know some niggas who had to get it who got it
Money old, sittin' up, sport ridin'
Go to trial, lose everything you got in front of your mama
In the jungle, getting lumber, anything can fumble
In the pot it crumble, when you're moving that ganje
By the bail, through the mail, fish scales
Can't tell, my trials, my tribulations got niggas all in the jail
Got 99 so all these niggas got 99 years
And they thuggin', 'cause in the gutter, they get ugly
In the trenches, they get vicious
And these bitches, they snitchin'
And these niggas, they sissies
You can't blame that, on my city
'Cause its greedy, and grimy
And my music, its timeless

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Life sentence, life sentence
I hate to see a nigga get a life sentence
In the streets, there's consequences
Them bricks'll get you life, nigga
Life sentence, life sentence
I hate to see a nigga get a life sentence
In the streets, there's consequences
Them bricks'll get you life, nigga
