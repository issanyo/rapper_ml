That’s the way the game goes
Vamp life
No slick
I told Future I can see the future
I told Young Street we gonna get some money
You heard me? Ha ha ha

Hook:
Chooper on that, chopper on that
My money, my problems, more sin
More bitches with more cash, more bitches with more cash, is all you nigga gonna get
And we gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes
We get fly every day, get high every day, it’s the way the game goes
It’s the way the games goes, the way the game goes
It’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes
It’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes
Don’t love these hoes, won’t let these hoes, won’t let these hoes these hoes
That’s the way the game goes
I’m black in prime, a big 4-5 and a packing luggage
I stack guessed up, my kick dough nigga stay messed up
And the drop head pet with the hop ..
Have to pull em might .. the cashed up
Look too good when we come to the hood
And we stood to the mother*cking ass up
Stupid I rap a town, nigga push up and I back em down
Graduated class, cause a I need a new smash
School to hard knocks no capin’ town
Ride around with scoot up, I’ma top down, let me see the hooters
When get the killers with the shooters, ???
Ride dirty on P stream, come by yourself when you need me
Make one call to my nigga young street
If I have a young killer with the street heat
What a street hang cup, you had a young .. street heat
Even that nigga when you see a black nigga
.. wrong let me get his beat beat

[Hook:]
Gotta sell the dope, got a .. can’t trust these nigga, no
You trap with us, I guarantee you see life different too
Them bricks you got it under me, nigga I ..
Don’t hit the store, don’t roll on the flips I really leave em
My Cuban flash with daddy got them ..
That’s why I f*ck with Jimmy, he a real street nigga
I’m up my show money when I buy some pimpin’
True house, full of white like every day is pimpin’
Gotta cup this money, gotta tell this .. gotta rap these chicken
If they ain’t ’bout no money nigga I ain’t with it
I call all these beaks and I know you feel it
Black nigga, Young Scooter we the boss nigga

Hook:
Chooper on that, chopper on that
My money, my problems, more sin
More bitches with more cash, more bitches with more cash, is all you nigga gonna get
And we gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes
We get fly every day, get high every day, it’s the way the game goes
It’s the way the games goes, the way the game goes
It’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes
It’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes
Don’t love these hoes, won’t let these hoes, won’t let these hoes these hoes
