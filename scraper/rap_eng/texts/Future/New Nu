[Intro/Outro]
Diamonds ain't gon' last so long
The good-good starting to feel wrong
I can't believe it ended so fast
(We're ending this way)
I don't wanna leave it in the past

[Verse 1]
Damnit, you've been doing me so wrong
And I've been puttin' up wit' it for so long
The minute I say I'm leavin'
You wanna try to give me all of these fancy things

[Hook]
Diamonds ain't gon' work this time
Money ain't gon' help, oh no no no
And the good dick just don't feel the same
It's such a shame we're ending this way

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, you can go
Cause I ain't puttin' up wit' it no more
Damn, I tried to stay and work it out
But you don't really wanna be here no more
I'm on that new shit!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I know you get cars
You're seeing another
There's no more love
It's no more us

Oh, and I know you got hoes
You're balling
It's easy
But please believe
It's nothing to me
Oh, cause

[Hook]
