[Hook: Future]
She told me that she wanna be my girlfriend
Cause she see me poppin' bottles
I pull up in a new gulato
I asked the bitch, "You a model?"
And then she told me that she swallow
I'm lookin' like I hit the lotto, then I opened up
A whole nother bottle (yeah)

[Verse 1: Future]
We ain't fucking 'round with yall fuck niggas
Me and my nigga Mike, we be roding up in them truck nigga
Young thicky dad but, he can't care if he alive nigga
He ain't no pussy nigga, I'd told you hoe he alive nigga
She don't know but, she want to know my name
Ask me when I'm sippin' out that hurricane
Gave me neck and the head but, so insane
Feels so good, Imma 'bout to go insane
And we ain't fucking 'round with fuck niggas
Me and my nigga Mike, we be getting straight to the buck nigga
My nigga he bad and boujee {LMAO}

That bullshit don't really matter to me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Just in case you don't know who I be
Michael Jackson, bitch that's who I be
Don't act like you don't know that it's me
I fucked a bitch and told her "ZaySamMi" (Woo) {Idk lmao}
Told the bitch to just stop playin' with me
She tried to try me like Billie Jean
I pull my weasel straight out my jeans
I throwed it just suck it I might just scream
She started to lick it just like ice cream
I love the way you be suckin' on me
Money, bitch it ain't nothin' to me (Woo)
And we ain't fucking 'round with yall fuck niggas
Y'all swear y'all spittin' game but

Somebody, hand me my shades

I got that skin disease
But, my enemies not my friends nigga
