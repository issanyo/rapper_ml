[Hook: Future]
I whip the Lambo off the lot doing donuts
I whip the chicken in the pot it was uncut
I whip the sprite and the lean then I poured up
I whip the white and the green, I got it sewed up
Got the whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up

[Verse 1: Mexico Rann]
I got that whip game sewed up, I'm a chemist
Dropped 1000 gram, made it 15 hundred
That's a whole split nigga playing with my arm
My whip game got all four pockets flooded
You got the Act on you nigga get pour it up
You gotta nine, give me a rack and I'll mix it up
Nigga I came all that curf, 50-50 swag
Yeah I got 5 spots, nigga going ham
Wasn't playing with that fuck boy, you can't lose
Teach a nigga game for free, you going against the rules
You can't play both side boy you gotta choose
I'm whipping dope in my Rari, nigga fuck the shoes

[Hook]
I whip the Lambo off the lot doing donuts
I whip the chicken in the pot it was uncut
I whip the sprite and the lean then I poured up
I whip the white and the green, I got it sewed up
Got the whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up


[Verse 2: Casino]
I'm in the kitchen know I'm water whipping
I'm a trap like Church's Chicken
Me and Leezy remix all our bongs
I drop a whole brick, it won't loose a fucking crumb
I put that Kirkwood across my arm
If I say you can't come then you can't come
I gotta whole ace served up
Check my resume, I been getting them dump trucks
My partner Phil got that lean, and it raw and it clean
2 cups you'll be sleep, I'm water whippin' in my sleep

[Hook]
I whip the Lambo off the lot doing donuts
I whip the chicken in the pot it was uncut
I whip the sprite and the lean then I poured up
I whip the white and the green, I got it sewed up
Got the whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up
