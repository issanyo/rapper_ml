(Intro)
Wadup, BJrhyme$... this another one right here lets get it
(BJrhyme$ on da track bitch)

(Hook)
No you can't take dis heat
I got crates that repletes with beet
Don't try to steal from me
Or get faded like wheat

(verse 1)
I ride with a draco
Stay high like a halo
Got on blue and yellow San Diego
Yo girl wanna suck me
If she fine imma dime and
I'm smashing her like a potato
I'm elite
A complete baller that
Was raised in da street
Ain't so sweet
But ill make ya have a seat
And stay in place like concrete
Draco hit ya meat
And see you really take dis heat
On repeat like skeet
Every day of the week
Yeah G, imma killer
A dealer, a robber not stealer
AK hit ya liver
Having you spilling ya dinner
Just fucking up ya figure
I know imma sinner
When i look in da mirror
I'm like damn i got bigger
And i'm not a builder
I'm just a little thinner
Got on black like gorillas
I stay with a trigger
They call me kill da winter
But it's not december
Im just another crazy nigga
And a good kisser damn
But you can still take dis
Quicker deliver jam
And remember

(Hook)
No you can't take dis heat
I got crates that repletes with beet
Don't try to steal from me
Or get faded like wheat

(verse 2)
Still, you can catch da fader
Maybe smoke some vapor
Look i'm not a major
I'm just another younging
That's tryna get through to dis paper
And i'm not a hater
And don't do any favors
Didn't then and won't do any later
But you can taste dis equator player
Then Maybe rebuke da flavor

(Hook)
No you can't take dis heat
I got crates that repletes with beet
Don't try to steal from me
Or get faded like wheat

(outro)
BJrhyme$
No! you can't take dis heat
Hustle and grind album
I'm out
