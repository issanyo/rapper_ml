[Verse 1]
I'm a young dope boy getting money (racks)
Ain't nothing buy a bitch new purse (designer)
Need a fly here on earth (space)
Find nigga who sell T-shirts (work)
T-shirt that shop for the work (lean)
Ain't got panties up under that skirt
Walk red bottoms til' you feet start to hurt
Want to go splurge
Want to go Gucci
Want to go Dolce
Want to go shopping
Want start over
Want to go brag
Want to go boasting
All to you friends
Tell them where you went
Shopping for the Benz
You got you a nigga
And all do win, win, win, win, win
I stay hitting licks again, again, again, again, again and again
You wanna set a trend
That's never gonna end
You wanna to have a mojo
Drive foreign Bouton
You want to have a style
That can't be denied
You love big house
Drive a fly ride
You want to hit the bank

Want rodeo

Drink champagne
