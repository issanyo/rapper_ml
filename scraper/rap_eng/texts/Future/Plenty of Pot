My customers love it real
So I only spit the shit I feel
And fuck the Washington's and Lincolns
I want bigger bills
I kill
The instrumental is my destiny
Give my heart and soul to ya'll
Forget about the rest of me
Please,........except my brain cause I'm insane son
Idolized these rappers way before I had became one
But.. I ain't a rapper I just learned to talk
Over melodies, and take my listeners for verbal walks
So, I'm flowin deadlier than cancer be
Future such a problem, ain't nobody got the answer sheet... see
Plus I'm the shit I know you peep the smell
Lyrically and sexually she say I'm always deep as hell
....always deep as hell
Somethin like the ocean cause her throat is goin deep as well
......feel like I need an L
Always got them bars like a nigga fell asleep in jail
