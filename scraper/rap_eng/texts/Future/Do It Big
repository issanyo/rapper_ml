[Intro: Future]
Yeah, turn the mic down
ATL Jacob
Yeah yeah, turn the mic
I'm makin' this money, it's drivin' me crazy
I'm fuckin' these bitches, they drivin' me crazy
Thirty chains on me
Ten million on me
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I'm in the studio with my Cali nigga
In the jugg house, kickin' bales with Bali's nigga
In the nineties nigga, we was ridin' colors with rallies nigga
In my hood I was sellin' dope in alleys nigga
You can't finesse me, I'm a mathematician
Done made two hundred million, I'm in the right position
I'm in my own lane, so ain't no competition
I gotta thank God I never been to prison (Young Scooter)
I got away with murder, forgive me for all my sinnin'
I'm doin' it for my kids, I'ma keep winnin' (count up)
My son 11 years old, already talkin' millions
By the time he 18, he own his own business

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I'm doin' it for my kids, doin' it for my kids (BMFBG)
I gotta do it big, gotta do it big
I'm doin' it for my kids, doin' it for my kids
I gotta do it big, gotta do it big
I'm doin' it for my son, and my fuckin' daughter
Black Amigo Scooter never had a father
Juugin' in these dirty streets, yeah it made me smarter
Gotta stay away from them niggas with them fed charges

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I ain't give a damn what my daddy left
My mama had the plug and I was right there
Elementary school, and already was a hustler
I was in middle school and already servin' customers
This is real talk, ain't nobody gon' fuck with us
I got Lil Dino with me, and he ready to touch you up
I used to be broke but, now a nigga rich as fuck
The streets ain't safe boy, you better keep you a pistol tucked
I got pounds, got bricks, I got ice
When the trap get hot, jump on a flight
To this money I got married, that's my wife
Everyday I'm flexin' nigga, that's my life
My lil cousin Quay fought and they gave him life
Jugg house, make over fifty bands a night
No flaws, sellin' weed for the rest of my life
HNIC and BMG and that's for life

[Verse 3: Future]
I made the Rollie talk big dawg lingo
Roll through the hood, let the kids yell bingo
Ten gold rings on my fingers, just like Deion
All red Mulsanne, bust the brain on a peon
Money, mo' money, mo' money, I think it done went to the head
Tatted my neck and my stomach, I'm 'bout to go tat up my legs
They puttin' the cut in the Actavis, now we gon' drink up the red
I copped me a Lambo, before I pulled off, I pulled off the head
Yeah, the Maybach got Maybach covers, takin' a nap in the bed
Yeah, I count a few million up and talk to my niggas in feds
Yeah, put em on FaceTime, let 'em see bitches I hit
Yeah, let 'em see all of my chains juggin' and look at my wrist, yeah

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I'm doin' it for my kids, doin' it for my kids (BMFBG)
I gotta do it big, gotta do it big
I'm doin' it for my kids, doin' it for my kids
I gotta do it big, gotta do it big
I'm doin' it for my son, and my fuckin' daughter
Black Amigo Scooter never had a father
Juugin' in these dirty streets, yeah it made me smarter
Gotta stay away from them niggas with them fed charges

[Outro: Future]
I'm makin' this money, it's drivin' me crazy
I'm fuckin' these bitches, they drivin' me crazy
Thirty chains on me
10 million on me
(Y'all fufu, fuckin' goofy)
