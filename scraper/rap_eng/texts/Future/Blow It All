[Intro: Tha Joker & Future]
I just blow it all
Yeaaahh! Astronaut
I just blow it all, Future!
I just blow it all, heey!

[Hook: Tha Joker]
Yeah, you know they hate you when you ball
I just wake and bake that loud, then I go shut down the mall
Go shut down the mall, then I go shut down your broad
Then I hit the club with the racks and blow it all
Yeah, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all
I just blow it all, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all

[Verse 1: Tha Joker]
I just blow it all, then she show it all
Damn I know the rent due, but I'm still gon' throw it all
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, all I know is ball
Your bitch give me brain, she's a "Know-it-all"
Rollin' on them E's, I can barely park my car
These ho's such a treat, thats why I pass 'em to my dawg
Fuck a bitch one time and I never ever call
Wake and bake that loud in the morning, you see us
On a paper chase but all you niggas do is crawl
Money grow on trees, I swear to god I'm just so log
Throw a little gwala, now your girl is anti-draws
Take her 'round my niggas, I bet you she gon' blow it all

[Hook: Tha Joker]
Yeah, you know they hate you when you ball
I just wake and bake that loud, then I go shut down the mall
Go shut down the mall, then I go shut down your broad
Then I hit the club with the racks and blow it all
Yeah, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all
I just blow it all, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all

[Verse 2: Tha Joker]
Baby, show out for your haters, dance for that paper
Yeah you naked now, Louis V comin' later
Snap out of that torso, nigga shoutout to the waiter
"OFF" and "FTE", big shoutout to my label
Shoutout to my haters, oooh I'm just a playa
Get these bitches with my Oakland like The Raiders
Don't think about to tomorrow baby, I'm a everydayer
Nigga jive turkey, i think homie need a baster!
You niggas fugazy, you be sweeter than a wafer
Maintain swag, swear my watch refrigerator
Wasted, faded, never need a chaser

[Hook: Tha Joker]
Yeah, you know they hate you when you ball
I just wake and bake that loud, then I go shut down the mall
Go shut down the mall, then I go shut down your broad
Then I hit the club with the racks and blow it all
Yeah, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all
I just blow it all, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all

[Verse 3: Future]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Anytime I hit you up, all I talk [?]
Louis V and Prada shit, you know I ain't never trippin' (designer)
Flow, you know my shit is so amazing
Wake up in them diamonds, got these bitches in a daze
All these carrats and diamonds got these bitches goin' crazy
I'm an astronaut, the highest level you can go
And anytime I'm in the club you know that money I'mma blow (blow)
I'mma throw it, I ain't scared to show it
5's 10's... and it's never talkin' 5's 10's
All the speakers bouncin', I'm goin' all in
I should've went to the NBA the way I'm ballin'
I can't be goin' nowhere without these labels callin'

[Hook: Tha Joker]
Yeah, you know they hate you when you ball
I just wake and bake that loud, then I go shut down the mall
Go shut down the mall, then I go shut down your broad
Then I hit the club with the racks and blow it all
Yeah, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all
I just blow it all, I just blow it all
20's, 50's, 100's, fuck it, I just blow it all
