[Intro]
What up Grandma like
Told you I had to do it
I'm just scared for you baby

[Hook]
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 1]
I got some money money talk dirty
I got my pockets doing the James Worthy
And I then took my heart through so many surgeries
Last night I walked around 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep sleeping with the birdies
These niggas play for keep the streets they real dirty
You have to practice with the preach
I'm takin' courage your pain running hell of deep
Don't get discouraged you in the belly of the beast
Don't get worried you know the niggas play for keeps
You still working you gotta pack miami heat
They always lurking
You can't think about the guilt its so many curses

[Hook]
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 2]
When you in the game playing foul
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town
Get two bad bitches and hit Grey Hound
I had to cut the couch down
They tried to burn the cross down
They even tried to bring God down
We shooting for the stars now
We living for the ground we going town to town
We riding round the city they treat you like Diddy
With all the crimes you done committed this must be winning
This only the beginning and we ain't even finished
I came from the highway right where the lighty city this ain't the ending

[Hook]
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise
