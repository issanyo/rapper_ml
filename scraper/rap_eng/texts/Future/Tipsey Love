Yeah, Vale, Yup

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V.]
You know what you came here for
So don't you hold back
Do it until it's done
Imma get whatever you drink
And tell the bartender
Pour you another one

[Chorus: Bobby V.]
I want that tipsey love
Tipsey, tipsey, tipsey love

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Verse: Bobby V.]
Yeah I know, I know you want this
You're looking at me like you lost something
Damn them heels, got you looking right
And that booty, make me wanna bite
Girl, don't front, what's it gone be?
One more shot, get you all on me
Two more shots, get you in my jeep
Three more shots, get you in my sheets

[Hook: Bobby V.]
I, I, I think I like it better when you buzzin'
You get a little loose
And you know the money ain't nothin', no
What you gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V.]
You know what you came here for
So don't you hold back
Do it until it's done
Imma get whatever you drink
And tell the bartender
Pour you another one

[Chorus: Bobby V.]
I want that tipsey love
Tipsey, tipsey, tipsey love
Yeah, Yeah
Imma be like girl, you can get it (ayy)
You can get it (ayy), you can get it
Imma be like girl, you can get it (ayy)
You can get it (ayy), you can get it

[Verse: Bobby V.]
Tell me what you want, lil vodka, Patron
Sex on the Beach, get you all in your zone, yeah
Yeah, girl, I like that when you start flirting
"Talk is cheap though", but Imma make it worth it.
I got you pinned up on the wall like a picture
And you roll that body like a swisher
And all you need is one mo' drink
And you know it's all on me

[Hook: Bobby V.]
I, I, I think I like it better when you buzzin'
You get a little loose
And you know the money ain't nothin', no
What you gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V.]
You know what you came here for
So don't you hold back
Do it until it's done
Imma get whatever you drink
And tell the bartender
Pour you another one

[Chorus: Bobby V.]
I want that tipsey love
Tipsey, tipsey, tipsey love
(tipsey love) Yeah, Yeah
Imma be like girl, you can get it (ayy)
You can get it (ayy), you can get it
Imma be like girl, you can get it (ayy)
You can get it (ayy), you can get it

[Verse: Future]
Pop bottles to the club, on fire, on fire
And we gone make it look like the 4th of July
You gone drink on what you drinkin'
Imma drink on what I'm drinkin'
Imma blow some of that stankin'
Imma blow some of that stank in
Imma set the move, Imma set the vibe
Imma come and scoop you up and take you for that ride
I know you wanna find somebody you can be comfortable with (future)
I know I wanna find somebody who about glamour and glits
Ice in cups with girls and drinks
Take these shots straight to your face
Let's toast up this ace of spades (let's toast up)
It's time to celebrate

[Chorus: Bobby V.]
I want that tipsey love (tipsey love)
Tipsey, tipsey, tipsey love (it's tipsey love)
Yeah, yeah
Imma be like girl, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it (2x)
Tipsey (7x)
Tipsey love!
