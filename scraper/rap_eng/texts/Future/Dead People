[Hook: Future]
Smokin' on this kush got me paranoid
Drinkin' all this lean, think it come from Mars
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
All these damn snakes wearing camoflage
Every girl wanna Nicki Menage
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People

[Verse 1: Future]
I grab the Egg Beater
I’m Seein' Dead People
I seent' them Fed people
I swipe the black Visa
I stay fresh like egg Easter (everyday)
With all this cash on me, walk with the Grim reaper
I go crazy on these features
I just murdered them Jacksons, Grant, and Benji’s
Freebang gang coupled up and ice we winning’
Franklin’ Franklin Franklin’, know exactly what I’m drankin'
100 million dollars, exactly what I’m thankin’
And anything over going back inside the comforter (FreeBandz!)
Foreign Coupe shoppin’ and it ain’t got nothin’ to do with stuntin'
I’m Schizo-fuckin’-phrenic in a room full of money
And I’m peeping’ out the window with a hand full of hundreds

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Gotta watch out for them people when you chasin' dead people
Them Grants and them Jackson's takin' penitentiary chances
Them Million dollar caps have a nigga living lavish
Sell a nigga anything when you thinking’ bout the Franklins (Finesse)
A freehand bag filled up with faces
All this damn money got me paranoid
Juugin’ all these bricks, I’m doin’ numbers bitch
Young Scooter all about them Dead Presidents
On Monday wrap them bricks up in Camoflauge
You ain't got them dead people you ain’t on your job
Don’t know what a brick weigh get out the streets brah'
Your plug ain’t working you could eat with us

[Hook: Future]
Smokin' on this kush got me paranoid
Drinkin' all this lean, think it come from Mars
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
All these damn snakes wearing camoflage
Every girl wanna Nicki Menage
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People

[Verse 3: Future]
Tortoise shell Tom Ford’s cover my eyesight
Long as I got my sack right I can give a fuck about ice
That Audemar on chill, that Breitling watch on chill
My pocket full of bills and I’m closing out big deals
I’m gonna get me a house in the hills, I’m talking’ bout Beverly Hills
Ya feel, have you ever in your life counted a mill
Ya feel like ya on a pill, and a brand new automobile
With a cup of drank and you drankin’ out the seal
200 on the dash, 200 cash and its real
Thats the only way I live, money cars and cribs
Got cameras everywhere with guns like T.I.P. still

[Hook: Future]
Smokin' on this kush got me paranoid
Drinkin' all this lean, think it come from Mars
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People

All these damn snakes wearing camoflage
Every girl wanna Nicki Menage
I’m Seein' Dead People
I’m Seein' Dead People
