[Intro: Future]
I know a better day comin', no love if you ain't workin'
We workin' outchea, you hear me?
Nigga goddamn motherfucker
That's hard, follow me

[Chorus: Future]
Thought that I could come back with that raw and I had came back robbing
Thought love would hurt me, but it didn’t hurt me none at all
Man I stayed working through a hard rain and thunderstorm
I'ma stack this paper up again like I'm never done
I got these rose gold jewels, I feel better now
I put the city on my back and I can't let 'em down
Go get that semi-automatic and I lay you down
I know some days I ain't have it, I can't play around

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
They like Scooter where you been? bitch I been sellin' raw
My nigga VL keep that stick like he playin' lacrosse
I lost a mil and got it back, can't take another loss
All that juggin' and finessin', made myself a boss
I got twenty gold chains, I feel better now
I got three kids, three thousand haters, I can't play around
I know you rap about the bricks but can you wrap a brick?
These niggas really entertainers 'cause they ain't sold shit
Lil Mexico City, we got cocaine
Thunderstorm, it's rainin' bricks, we don't get rain
And I'ma stack this money like I've never done
I karate chop a brick like I'm Daniel-san

[Chorus: Future]
Come back with that raw and I had came back robbing
Thought love would hurt me, but it didn’t hurt me none at all
Man I stayed working through a hard rain and thunderstorm
I'ma stack this paper up again like I'm never done
I got these rose gold jewels, I feel better now
I put the city on my back and I can't let 'em down
Go get that semi-automatic and I lay you down
I know some days I ain't have it, I can't play around

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Jugghouse, nothin' but cash around
Lay it down, nigga lay it down
Jugghouse, nothin' but players around
If I'm around then bring some pounds around
I got ghosts, they don't make a sound
Until you hear that chopper sound, you on the ground
My diamonds wetter than the ocean, yours [?]
All I do is count, get money in large amounts
If you in the streets then watch out for the triple cross
'Cause I done seen niggas' mamas take they ass off
I got spots and in my house I got a pack [?]
Count music, give the streets what they ask for

[Chorus: Future]
Come back with that raw and I had came back robbing
Caught love with her bitch but it didn't hurt me none' at all
Man I stayed working through a hard rain and thunderstorm
I'ma stack this paper up again like I'm never done
I got these rose gold jewels, I feel better now
I put the city on my back and I can't let 'em down
Go get that semi-automatic and I lay you down
I know some days I ain't have it, I can't play around
