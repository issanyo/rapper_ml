[Hook: Future]
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Let's fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Forty thou to a hunned thou
A hunned thou 'nother hunned thou
Three hunned thou, five hunned thou
A million, let's have a money shower
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Let's fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Forty thou to a hunned thou
A hunned thou 'nother hunned thou
Three hunned thou, five hunned thou
A million, let's have a money shower

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Fuck up some commas, Tunechi
Let's fuck up the future, Future
My homie just robbed an Uber
I get a discount on cruises
Ain't no more Cash Money, just money
A nigga pull up if it's somethin'
They don't call me Jr no more
They call me the number 1 stunna
Give no fuck shit, we don't give no fucks
Put on my tux, here comes the bride in her all white cups
Hundred million to a fuckin' billion
All these broke niggas unfamiliar
My bitch bad, I say, â€œMama Mia"
Pants sag like the young Aaliyah, Lil Tunechi

[Hook: Future]
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Let's fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah

A million, let's have a money shower
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
