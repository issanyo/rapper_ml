[Intro: Future]
Ain't nothin' wrong with it...

[Hook: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I-I-I won't play around
I-I-I wanna lay you down
I-I-I need you now
I-I-I need you now, oh

[Hook: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e-e and affection

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering
I'm wondering, If I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
Cause a nigga' might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
Don't put it down
Don't fuck around
I want you now
I want you now, oh

[Hook: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e-e and affection

[Verse 3: Future with Rihanna]
Can you love me for poor?
I'm searching for my soul
Who ever turned you cold?
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
Future

[Hook: Rihanna & Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e-e and affection
