I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food
Dog food, dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, dog food
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I keep that K and that 9 but I ain't had a bit
House full of bricks, I done killed more dogs than Vick
Went from sleeping out there, wear my partner's clothes
Put that dog in the hood, fuck the animal control
[?] phones close when we in the laundromat
A nigga ride me, I'mma make him bring my money back
I just had on my tat, I been on this shit to long
Niggas tryna fight me in the club, they ain't gonna make it home
We done did a lotta wrong, just to get right
I bought my my girl everything my ex bitch liked
Do ya soulja, dirty sprite, but we got that coke for sale
We gone go a lot of way, but we ain't gonna go to jail

[Hook: Future]
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food
Dog food, dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, dog food
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I bought some dog food and fed all my dogs with it
And bruh, I thank the lord the feds ain't come get me
You only win when you quit while you winning
Fuck everything, kill me, but momma I finally did it
Spend 30 on the rollie, I know that they remember
I gave that bitch away that bought me a new presidential
Now that's a 7 on my wrist, we only shop with LED
The only shit that live forever is the shit they won't forget
Hopping out of 'em lambs, feel asleep in 'em raris
Half a million in jury, there out nigga to rob me
I ain't gotta do the music
Cause in the block for Frank Lucas

[Hook: Future]
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food
Dog food, dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, dog food
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
My hood done treat me like I'm El Chapo

[Verse 3: Ralo]
The Bluff, the set on aspen and jack
They showed me love in Ohio I ain't forgot about that
We hold it down in the 9, ruled it, know we up next
[?] regretting, regret we ever met
(?) in the debt, we gone die with our respect
They play my shit, it's a family, I take cash from Carolina
I sent my packs from Atlanta, it ain't nothing they can't handle

[Hook: Future]
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I keep that dog food
Dog food, dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
Dog food, dog food
Dog food, I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
My hood done treat me like I'm El Chapo
