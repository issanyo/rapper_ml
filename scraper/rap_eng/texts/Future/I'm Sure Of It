[Intro: Future]
Free my nigga
Yeah

[Hook: Future]
My dog in the cemetery and I can’t bring him back
All these bitches do is complain, adding on to the stress
I could buy another bitch like, I’m sure of it
I could buy another bitch, I’m sure of it
My style only bubbling, I’m sure of it
I told you we would make it, I was sure of it
I told you I would get that money right away
Soon as that Maybach dropped, I copped that bitch right away
They better free my niggas, bitch, right away
Don’t make us pull up with them sticks bitch, right away

[Verse 1: Lil Donald]
I can buy another bitch, buy another watch
I can make this throw away and buy another gat
I put them shooters on your head, nigga right away
Pull off on 12, green light, I got the right of way
They put my partner in the ground I smoked a whole pound
Rest in peace to my niggas, ain’t no peace with you niggas
You better free all of my niggas 'fore I come and get them
That crack Ebola in the trenches, that’s a real sickness
I’m eating noodles in the Bentley that’s just how I’m feeling
Bitch always in her feelings while I’m chasing the millions

[Hook: Future]
My dog in the cemetery and I can’t bring him back
All these bitches do is complain, adding on to the stress
I could buy another bitch like, I’m sure of it
I could buy another bitch, I’m sure of it
My style only bubbling, I’m sure of it
I told you we would make it, I was sure of it
I told you I would get that money right away
Soon as that Maybach dropped, I copped that bitch right away
They better free my niggas, bitch, right away
Don’t make us pull up with them sticks bitch, right away

[Verse 3: Yung Booke & Lil Donald]
And we gon' come through spraying on them night and day
Pour up in the Phantom, put that Sprite away
My dog caught a thirty, I ain't seen him in a decade
Had to counsel his lil' bitch, wasn't nothing but a headache
So many shooters off of one whip, you think we ese's
Heh, speaking of ese's, my bitch texting me essays
Bout shit that I don't know about
No hopscotch, you get chalk it out and spark it out
We don't talk it out
Another bitch gonna want her a real one, well I’m triller
A 24k gold toilet I don’t maneuver for

[Hook: Future]
My dog in the cemetery and I can’t bring him back
All these bitches do is complain, adding on to the stress
I could buy another bitch like, I’m sure of it
I could buy another bitch, I’m sure of it
My style only bubbling, I’m sure of it
I told you we would make it, I was sure of it
I told you I would get that money right away
Soon as that Maybach dropped, I copped that bitch right away
They better free my niggas, bitch, right away
Don’t make us pull up with them sticks bitch, right away
