See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on 'em
Nigga gon' keep that mask on 'em
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nig keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap, target

[Verse 1]
Solitaires on me, no cards
Niggas gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got that yopper on him right now
And he ready to pull up right now
Choppa hit a nigga with the scope
Fuck that pussy shit, we sellin' dope
Turn the hood into Iraq
On the corner, flippin' that pack
AK-47 and lortabs
Drugs, a pound of fuckin' Percocets
Fell asleep and woke up with that yopper
And he playin' with it right now

[Hook]
See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on him
I'mma keep that cash on
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nigga keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that 44. camouflage (my lil one, my lil one, my lil one)
AR & Tec, that's a real menage
Jump out the side of a caravan
Flippin' that work, you the middle man
Got that penthouse with the dogs off it
You take that Roxies with some alcohol
You rob in the daytime
My trap is a gold mind, nigga
Pour the four and cut the four
You play with that dog food
You play with that, play with that
These niggas are runnin' a gun store
They come and kick in your front door
Those goonies  got hoodies and money
Frank Lucas, a role model
Hit 'em and hit 'em and lick 'em up
And go get your own bottle

[Hook]
See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on him

I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nigga keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap, target
