(Dj Tripp Da Hit Major)

[Hook: Future]
Real Street Nigga I Ain't Get Nothin But Some Pain From It(8x)

[Verse 1:Bloody Jay]
Real Street nigga, I ain't get nothin but some pain from it
Real hustle I ain't get nothin but some game from it
Rock stayed on me ain't get nothin but some game from him
Took out the plug now ya can't get nothing but caine from me
Broke it all down now you can't get nothin but a drain from me
Made me blood now they can't get nothin but stains from me
You know I keep it so you cannot get a thang from me
Lee gave it to em so you did not get that thing from me
But then again he's me
And I'm Lee, and there's nothin bigger than the B
But you knew that already
And anything after that is secondary

[Verse 2:Bloody Jay]
Shot my 1st nigga didn't get nothing but some fame from it
I got my first name from it
Fucked up what happen to ol' Flip
I remember feelin like Birdie after I flipped the clip
After that it was bandanas and hoodie


I'm talkin way before the Sam Hoody
I got blood in my eye(2x)
Try to take grams, D.T., D.B., Lil Reggie from B.G. ,C.M.B
Lil Bris too
B.I.P. them my bloods too
