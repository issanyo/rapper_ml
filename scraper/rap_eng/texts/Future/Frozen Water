All my diamonds drip, drippin' like it's water, water
First you take the batch and mix it in the water, in the water
Then you pack a bag and meet me at the border, frozen
I be goin' hard just like frozen water, frozen
All my diamonds drip, drippin' like it's water, water
First you take the batch and mix it in the water, in the water
Then you pack a bag and meet me at the border, border

Yellow diamonds like a cab

Get some head on the Snap
Bought the Lamb just to trap

Five milli on my neck, I'm good, yeah
Drinkin' Codeine like it's Robitussin
Water on me like a water challenge
Drippin', drippin', I got frozen diamonds

[Verse 2: Belly]
She mix the lies with the truth, I mix the batch with the juice
I'm tellin' Hennessy lies, I'm tellin' Actavis truths
I think I'm relapsin' and shit, I just fell asleep in the shower
I'm feelin' weak, need some power
The plug gon' be back in an hour
She found a bag full of powder
"Oh no, baby, that ain't flour"
Told her jump up on the table, bet that pussy get devoured

[Refrain: Future]
Yeah, yeah, all my diamonds drippin' like some frozen water
I got chains and they flooded like New Orleans, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Future]
All my diamonds drippin' like some frozen water
All my diamonds flooded like its from New Orleans
First you take the Codeine, mix it in some Sprite
When that drink turn pink, that's what I like
We gon' kill these pussy niggas on sight
We gon' fuck yo' main bitch on sight
We 'bout to pop a hundred bottles like it's water
You want that good batch, meet me at the border
You want that good batch, meet me at the border
