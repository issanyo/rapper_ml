Codeine in our system like champagne
Toast it up for niggas in the game
Real street niggas we sum real ones
Ralo bout that gwala real one

[Hook: Future]
Rollie on yo time piece
Trynna stack and grind?
You see this bitch with me a dime piece
And she know I’m paid (4x)
We some real ones
Throwin' this money won’t lie to you
Blowin' this money won’t lie to you
Fuckin' these hoes won’t lie to you
Throwin this dough won’t lie to you
Fuckin' these thotties won’t lie to you
Fuckin' these bitches won’t lie to you
Bad bitches won’t lie to you
Bad bad bitches won’t lie to you

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I promise I swear won’t lie can’t lie
Everything I got came out that pot (that’s on er'thing)
It only cost a 30' I got it back in 30' minutes (30 mins)
What it took to get could gave me a life sentence
I made it out the mud now my shoes don’t get muddy
My lil niggas make yo big dawg look like puppies
They use to say fuck me now them hoes trynna' fuck me
Lil mama a be lucky if she touch me
They ain' believe in us I made em' all believers
I drop outta' school and made mo' money than our teachers
Got that rollie now these niggas actin' like they know me
How Im hot and that rollie got my wrist frozen

[Hook: Future]
Rollie on yo time piece
Trynna stack and grind?

And she know I’m paid (4x)
We some real ones
Throwin' this money won’t lie to you
Blowin' this money won’t lie to you
Fuckin' these hoes won’t lie to you
Throwin this dough won’t lie to you
Fuckin' these thotties won’t lie to you

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck all that shit I'ma real one
You know what it take just to be wit a real one
Know all this 'case I'm the real one
Know all this ice I'ma real one

Audi Margies the real one
Fuck all you niggas the real one
Fuck all you niggas the real one
I fuck dat bitch on a solo
I got a stain like polo
See these medallions they light up and go doe
I'm ready for photos so fuck all the photos
I told ya Im too real for this shit
I fuck around and build me a bitch
I'm good for that mouth and the top on the low-low?
Trappin' that house out the bando
Trappin' that house out the bando I know it
I'm gutta' she know it
Pretty exotic I know it
I wanna fuck her right now and she know it
I got that tool on me now and they know it
Shout out my jeweler my necklace the booler??
I can’t be trippin' my watch from Lacroix
I can’t be trippin' the way I maneuver
The chopera, the ruger the bezzle and the keys and them pills I'ma move
And I'll prove it
