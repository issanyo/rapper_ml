[Intro: Future]
Apply major pressure my nigga
You hear me?

[Hook 1: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
A nigga's got five different iPhones
I only pick it up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
It's Ray Bands and Freebandz, we getting money
While you're hating, we're somewhere in Abu Dhabi
With Arabians G5'in, and with my posse
It's outrages, on that good Jamaican
That's right I'm too faded, you're two shaded
I'm too greedy with two ladies
Excellence I'm exuberating
I'm finna smash like two potatoes
I don't give a fuck, not even two maybes
I turn up on niggas like rutabagas
I do it daily, I do it daily
That's my swag, you should pay me
Ain't that the truth?
This is my whip, ain't that the coupe?
Hustle Gang ain't that the squad?
Bitch, act like you've got a clue
While they out here catching feelings, I'mma catch a flight or two
I just give her major pressure while she gave me major (ooooh!)

[Hook 2: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
They've got five different iPhone's
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Anything they wanna do, hell yeah I'm ready for it
Sexy bitch, just throw that back, hell yeah she's ready for it
They thought that the boy was stool, now my shit, they're checkin' for it
And your girl, she's addicted to it, I think that ho needs Betty Ford
All I heard was "that boy's pop"
All I heard was "that boy's not"
Top 5 on any list, but I've moved up by five slots
I'm passed one, high as fuck
I don't see niggas until I look down
I've just turned my crib in to the hookah spot
You are now welcomed to the kush lounge
So miss me with that fuckery
Girl, come here with that suckery
Ham Squad, Hustle Gang, that's that Underground Luxury
I don't mess with them fake types, I'd ban hem all, if it was up to me
Even if a bitch was a cashier, still she'd never get a buck from me

[Hook 3: Future]
Money on my mind, can't get off that shit
They've got five different iPhones
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
