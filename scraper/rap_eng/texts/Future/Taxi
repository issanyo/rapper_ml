The taxi had bullet holes in it
The little kids was laid out
Can you tell me who gon' miss 'em
They done knocked the whole family off
I had to hustle 'til my soles bleed
Buyin' more guns on the lowkey
It's playin' out for me on Rolling Stone
I told the squad they gotta hold on

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Before these fuck niggas kill me, man I gotta touch some millions
They screamin' fuck love, I hope my heart end up missing
Fell in love with pain pills, I got percs all in my system
Leave the drank to my nigga Future, I don't do no sippin'
Some of my closest niggas start to treat me different
Guess I gotta watch 'em close while I still maintain my distance
Every night I think about who tryna murder me
I hope they don't hit no artery so I make it through surgery
Double back and get a nigga's whole family whacked
And my youngin hold a gun to the front like a fanny pack
Run down and clap a nigga on his front porch
Go inside, find his bitch, and shoot the gun more
(Kill that bitch too)

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz & Future]
Thought we was through with all the love songs
You need to be there for my head space
Thought we was through with all the love songs
Hope you'll be there until my dying day
I hope my bitch still hold me down
And hope the game plan and stay down until we come up
I'm on that same thing
Hope you around just in case a nigga do fall off
Or case the feds pick me up you still answer my calls dog
I'm going through some things, I'm fighting my emotions
Young nigga tryna stay focused
I'm tryna stay focused
