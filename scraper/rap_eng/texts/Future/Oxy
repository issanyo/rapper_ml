[Intro: Future]
I see funny faces

[Chorus: Future]
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin

Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy

Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Medicine Man
Medicine Man taking off never to land
United we fall, together we stand
I pop a whole she took a half
I'm feelin’ gold she lookin tan
It never gets old she never get mad
We too high to fuck, I never hit that
Cotton candie sweet as gold
Make that pussy open close
She take her meds up her nose
Looking like she smell a rose
It says Hermès on my clothes
20 mg, that's my dose
I fucked her off one of those
She act like she saw a ghost
Wake up baby, comatose
Wake up baby, vamonos
Sleeping like we on an island somewhere in Galapagos
Its lonely at the top we hold hands, Geronimo
100% cotton oxymoron, oxycontin

[Chorus: Future]
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

[Verse 2: Future]
Matchy-matchy nigga just stop it
Niggas always try to copy
Drinkin' sake
Hachi Tachi
I eat beef, Johnny Rocket
Over the bowl in the faucet
Crank that hoe, John Gotti
Ben Frank, meet the pocket
Pocket watchin’, pick a pocket
Richard Mille prolly
Got me lookin cocky
Drinkin' in the lobby
Catching, Jeremy Shockey
Cuban link my wallet, and it's camouflagin'
It ain't no discussion
Had her hit your target
Bentley with the roof
Got Versace carpet
Sippin' lean like soup
Yeah hachi tachi
Imma pop an X
Imma try the Oxy
I just tried oooh
I can't feel my body

[Chorus: Future]
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at that bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique
Oxy

[Outro: Future]
Freebands!
Yeah I got some pills
Yeah I got the Perc
Yeah I got this big booty bitch in my vert
And I got a room, and it's downtown
And my wife...
