[Intro: Future]
Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain (we ridin')
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the Coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, thatâ€™s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Interlude: Future]
Four-door Maybach; I drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)

[Verse 2: Pilot]
Uh, I got a kilo
I snort up every time God says so
Pistol on autopilot
Lookin' like Chapo, lookin' like Pablo
No drugs I'm meaner
Inhalin' on bathroom cleaner
Eastside Beast with the Midas touch
Ain't no feast that I don't eat
All my enemy fall to their knees
Ain't no time for them to beg
Havin' coke, you wouldn't peg
Half of y'all need to chill
I might join the Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Pakistan (say no more)
I might murder him for real (say no more)
Pilot you need to fly now
Traveling to cloud nine
And I snuck out through the back door
Right hand copy like 10-4
He bike like Lance in France
Codeine, codeine, codeine
I look at myself and ask what happened
How y'all let an innocent kid get suspended? While y'all use him to set an example?
How y'all let him abuse the dope?
How y'all don't accept the blame?
Now y'all don't even know how to save him
People lookin' at me like I'm dead
Everybody who underestimated
Gotta get up now and hide from me
Gotta go home now if ya makin' threats
Gotta say something now, don't just listen
I mean, I'm hiding now
I got the equation, got the potion
I got 'em all in position
And emotions, I put positions in question
And put the answer in the vents
I made a vendetta when
They told me get a new school
Then I died and was reborn
All my friends they distant
Livin' life on a low end
Gotta keep my shit higher up
It's deep (It's deep)
I done fucked up so much I can't eat (can't eat)
I done fucked up so much I might retire (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Pilot (swear to God)
God relief me of this pain (swear to God)
Bitch, please forgive me, Pilot live through me (I am Pilot)
Get your ass up and become something (be yourself)
Are you aware of all the evil going on in the world? (how much?)
Take the mask off so you can see

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
