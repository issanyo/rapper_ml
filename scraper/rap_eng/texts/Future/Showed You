[Intro: Future & Young Thug]
DJ EscoMoeCity
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All my life I showed you
Ran it up on you and showed you
Yeah I put ice on you, I glowed you
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke I see police in them dog
And all my life I'm 'posed to show you and show you

[Verse 1: Future]
Pockets stretched out like I got a barrel on me
I'm so Pluto, out of reach, can't come close to me
YSL, Bleaveland Ave, boy I bleed with them
Gun smoke in the air
Blow that heat with them
All my life I been a hustler and I showed you
I got 10 whips outside and they showed you
I put a Rover in the pot and took it global
I get a whip imported out, come fully loaded
I got some money, bought medallions
That bitch so bad we call her stallion
Gotta put more zips inside the styrofoam
Fucked up your budget on one stone
You get so rich they try to treat you like a outsider
I ran it up, they try to find a way to criticize it
Selling dope and juugin taking I ain't forgot about it
I became a legend in the streets they ain’t gon’ forget about me

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All my life I showed you
Ran it up on you and showed you
Yeah I put ice on you, I glowed you
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke I see police and them dog
And all my life I'm supposed to show you and show you

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
And all my life I run it up nigga that's my paper
Get the fuck up out my face before I violate you
All the pretty bitches love me I can not blame 'em
I would love me too but still I can not save 'em
I heard the niggas talking crazy, acting wild gangsta
I got some niggas right beside me that'll violate ya
I got the .30 on me, tucked, I call that my baby
I only hit her up to bust, but still that's my baby
And I'm like ooh I ain't here to talk I came to fuck you
I know you just wanna have fun ooh
Well I got a plug with me, yeah
And I got a thug with me, yeah
And he got a drum on him like, ooh
Nigga wit a hoodie and a gun, ooh
I know you don't wanna be the one, ooh
Oh it's a dub for 'em, yeah
Put up a dub in 'em, yeah
Came out the mud on 'em, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All my life I showed you
Ran it up on you and showed you
Yeah I put ice on you, I glowed you
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke I see police and them dog
And all my life I'm supposed to show you and show you

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Mm, let me have your soul please
You, nigga with a nose ring
Never sitting in the nose bleeds
I showed you and you show me
The type to feed my whole team
If you're starving you don't know me
Take care of my mother, brother, all my nieces, aunties
To spend your cap, no cap, no Don C
I ain't the type to call the police
He lick the pussy with the codeine
The only time I let him OD
Die for me

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All my life I showed you
Rand it up on you and showed you
Yeah I put ice on you, I glowed you
Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke I see police and them dog
And all my life I'm supposed to show you and show you
