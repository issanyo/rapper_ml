[Verse 1]
Im straight outta pot piss
Bought da yop and then flood my wrist
Aquafina glacier got my neck on aguilera
Fuck her in the throat till i fuck up dat bitch mascara
Fucking with that hoe you done danced around with the devil
Im gone off my medication / half of these niggas traded
My loyalty ain't for satan / I'm highly anticipated
Soon as that bently truck drop I'm getting it i fucking made it
Ghost or the maserati / ill shit on your dead body
These niggas ain't playing fair
These bitches ain't playing fair
I just spent heroin fare on mollies and lean yeah
Designer thats all i wear (x2)
I just hit that bitch bare
I just fucked that bitch bare
I fuck ya then buy medusas / pull up in a barracuda
Sipping that lean with my shooter
I'm eating up at chinese buddha
Some fortures i gotta torture
These niggas getting out of order
Get knocked off for half a quarter
I'm alpo and richie porter
I'm ace boogie in his prime
I make niggas bump dat iron
I live in another line
I go talk to Farrakhan

All the dope save my brothers (x2)
Give em a cake of butter
Show em how much I love em
Punk bitches we don't trust em
These bitches ain't playing fair
These niggas ain't playing fair
I just spent heroin fare on my designer gear
Designer my underwear / I got designer everywhere
I got designer everywhere (x2)
Money cars everywhere
My bitches live everywhere

My bitch took her skin and tried to bleach it
She say this foreign pussy got me tweaking
I Told her all this money got me geechee
Bend her over fuck her in the asshole
And i keep that hot with me mutambo
Fuck you pussy niggas.. donnie brasco
Drop em in a river with his eyes closed

Pull the phantom up at the arena
