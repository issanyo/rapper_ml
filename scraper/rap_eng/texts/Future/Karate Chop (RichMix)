You know... this just some real nigga shit
A real nigga story, ya know what I'm sayin'?

Slang a, bunch of, nar-cotics
Pull up, in the, new, 'rarri

Drink a, bunch of, co-deine
Servin', to the, dope, fiends
Blowin', money, stay, clean
Michael, Jackson, +Billy, Jean+

[Future]
Got a, Pana-mera, round a, young, nigga, neck
Got a, young, bitch, pullin', up, in a, vet
Smoke a, lot of, kush, and I, have a, lot of, sex
Had to, beat the, grind, up, ran, up my, check
Bitch, nigga, get, money, nigga, get, that
Roll a, blunt of, chronic, nigga, sell a, lot of, crack
You can, hit a, nigga, line, order, what you, want
I can, whoop a, Mase-rati, pullin', up a, donk

Pop a, Ace of, Spade, bottle, sip a, lot of, syrup
Keep a, young, nigga, workin', gotta, buss a, cape

Dollar grind, bought a line, nigga rich
Trappa money, look at what this nigga did
