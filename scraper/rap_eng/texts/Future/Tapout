[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
All around this room
Baby me and you
I don't wanna let you down
That's a perfect view
Looking at you
I just wanna love you down
You got that million dollar, that million dollar turn up
I got that cranberry d'usse in my cup
And I been looking for somebody I can spend this money on
And make you tapout

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Wait, hold up
Party just beginning
And I know that we ain't married
But this don't feel like sinning
Uh this one is for you
Perfect crazy sexy cool
Tight like glue, just us two
Girl let's get stuck together
There's a storm in this house
But outside its perfect weather
Break the arm off the couch
Cause we fucking like we mean it
Let's have some alien sex
I'm from Mars, you from Venus

[Bridge: Verse Simmonds]
All I wanna do is touch it
That million dollar ooh ooh ooh
All I wanna do is touch it
That million dollar ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3: Future]
The got that million dollar
Million dollar ooh ooh ooh
She got that million dollar
Million dollar ooh ooh ooh
And all I wanna do is touch it
Ooh ooh ooh
Make her tapout
Tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout
And Imma make her tapout
Tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout

[Verse 4: Verse Simmonds]
I''m in love with your Egyptian skin
And you talk about religion
I'm in prison with the pussy
And I'm falling no cushion
