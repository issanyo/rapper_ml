[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
I swear I never tell a soul
Before you know you gotta show me, ya heard me?
Uptown life
It be the ones thats closest to you
Ay what it do, what it is?
It be them fuck boys
On everything, I ain't never tellin'
Ay what it do, what it is? (DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: Future]
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti & Future]
My PO wanna violate me
I swear I never tell another soul
Chopper hold a hundred, let off 80
I swear I never tell another soul
I like bitches who like bitches
I swear I never tell another soul
These niggas talk just like bitches so
I swear I never tell another soul
400 for the lamb, 550 for the rolls, nigga
Swear I never tell another soul
600 for a pound, 550 for the O, nigga
I swear I never tell another soul
130 for the Porsche, 210 for the Bentley
I swear I never tell another soul
How to fuck a nigga hate to see a real nigga winning?
I swear I never tell another soul (How to fuck a nigga hate?)
Better ask about me nigga, dope boy shit for real
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear to God touched 10 mil, I swear
I swear I never tell another soul
Young nigga had no deal, street skills
Big pistols, young nigga so real
If the whole hood know, put the city on his back
And they never took another soul, never took his back
Let's get it

[Chorus: Future]
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy & Future]
Fuck niggas wanna live my life
I swear I never tell another soul
Who be down with the hoe that done tell my wife?
I swear I never tell another soul
I guess me and you 'posed to be beefin' now
I swear I never tell another soul
I'll bust ya head when the time is right
I swear I never tell another soul
I know a nigga that's doin' life
All because his co-d had four
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold
That fuck nigga told
His home boy was a D-boy
But he act like a CI, takin' notes like a PI
Carried on like a peon
You see a fuck nigga holler "FBI!"
I've seen him on First 48
Said he had everything on tape
And he the nigga with the gun with the drum
In his hands hold and fuck nigga turned state
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin'
'Bout a nigga that put him on on death row
These niggas too cutthroat
And as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up

[Chorus: Future]
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul
I swear I never tell another soul
Swear I never tell another soul

[Outro: Future]
We be ridin' in 'em mailbox cars nigga, yeah that was us
I swear I never tell another soul

Swear I never tell another soul

Swear I never tell another soul, yeah
