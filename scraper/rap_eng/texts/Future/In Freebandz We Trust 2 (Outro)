[Spoken Outro - Future]
In freebandz we trust two
Freebandz we trust part two
My brother Doe Beezy goin’ all the way up pass the Moon level
You know I’m sayin’? It’s Future Hendrix, Supa Future
[?] how we drippin’ off [?] at all times
It won’t matter how I cut, I cut it with smoke
You dig what I’m sayin’? Eat that up
Doe Boy you’ve got ‘em, keep your foot on the gas
Boss, quadruple boss
I appreciate you for showin’ me so much loyaly my nigga like
At the end of the day nigga never let this shit change us
Keep it on [?] nigga, hard work
Self motivation, self driven
Prosperity, keep the faith
Good energy will take further than you can imagine
It’s love, in Freebandz Gang We Trust Two
Future Hendrix, Supa Future
Astronaut nigga, gang
Cleveland Ohio, got so much love in Ohio
Never be the twisted
Understand that no flex no cap
We ran this shit up nigga, this shit secured
The hood follow us, the street niggas follow us
All the niggas in main subject in every city, they behind us one thousand percent
‘Cause it’s always been love and embracement when it comes to the game
Niggas know bosses on bosses, niggas at the trenches
They made a way out of nowhere, securin’ big bands
Upper echelon bands, top floor five star
General type shit at all times nigga
You in front of a nigga that got god damn motherfuckin’ goons
Or whatever it is
Nigga it’s time to boss up nigga, we be the biggest shooters
The biggest doctores, the biggest motherfuckers
Niggas in the motherfuckin’ world, period
In the entertainment business, [?]
[?] in the community, always givin’ back [?]
People [?] for you, [?] behave and go back reach out
That’s what this is about
In Freebandz we trust, in Freebandz we trust two
It’s a part two, second time comin’ around for this
Trials and tribulations, you got your soul on this fool
I’m super proud of you my nigga, like straight up for bossin’ up
Been a solid one thousand nigga out of the gate
Freeband game forever
