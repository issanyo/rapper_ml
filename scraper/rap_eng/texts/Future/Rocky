[Hook]
Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin' designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa

[Verse 1: Future]
Give me a set of keys or a melody and I'll go crazy
I'm blowin' trees in my fatees ain't no Fugazzi
Even in them A1's I'm sure I got the same bipolar
The super charger going stupid hard, now I'm pullin' up in the drops homie
You ain't never been this high
Good thing I got, I'mma own me a car lot
Spit fire to the studio, just like a trap spot, I've been fly
Ask cop guy, no lie
Went from getting a house bust to bustin' a stadium
Only take a day off, getting them Benjamins
Runnin' this trick, I'm runnin' up in the mills
It ain't low key and that's new lingo, new millennium
I'mma spit a verse, I drew my 10 and i don't take this life for granted
Blood sweat and tears ain't just happening
I'm a free band nigga with a plan

[Hook]
Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money

I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin' designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa

[Verse 2: Future]
With my back against the rope, selling dope, baking coke
Child support, no support
I still had hope, I always spoke
Banished into existence
I never lost faith, I kept my place
Paper chase every day
It's we sensei but it's why I stay
And I go ape behind this cake
I stay laced, look at my face
I can't see you, money in the way
I'm up to date in outer space
A new regime, a brand new day
I'm infamous, got lion trace
What I'm tryna say I'mma keep that fire inside me til my heart decay

Went from sellin' yay (so what?)
To sellin' verses (true story!)
The gift, the curse, I done been through the worst
They let the real for real surface
100 million dollars is my only damn purpose

[Hook]
Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money

Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa
