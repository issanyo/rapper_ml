[Hook: Future]
A hunned bands exotic
The truck a Maserati
The girls, they came from Follies
I got 'em on the molly
She rode it like Bugatti
They got my style copied
Now that's a trending topic (Future)
Yeah that's a trending topic
A thousand bales of midget
Hurry up and come and get it
We finessin' for the check, and we drug dealin'
The bitch from magic city, shakin' ass, and titties
One thing about it, that's a trending topic

[Verse 1: Future]
My bank won't tell no lie, my cash gon tell the truth
My truck came with no brain, my coupe came with no roof
My bitch she about her cash, she shake her titties and booty
I turned her up with swag, then future got the juice
I know some girls from follies, can't wait till they off work
Ima let em hit this molly, then watch em go berserk
A hundred bags of kush, I'm gettin that Maserati first
I put money over bitches,flyest nigga on this earth
Every broad on my timeline, they foreign and they bad
Every nigga on the sideline, they hatin' and they mad
They askin around about me,everything comin' back solid
I be hustlin' and finessin' plus I'm arrogant and cocky

[Verse 2: Future]
Got that loud pack on deck
Good cough syrup on deck
Got Miley Cyrus on deck
That white girl, she wet
Here take this,get naked
Got black girls on deck
Got a Puerto Rican and some Asian hoes
Lookin' like a box of them crayons
Got kush spray on my shirt
That's water drippin off soft
You heard I finesse
They tell you I was a boss?
They checkin' on my Instagram, wanna see the way I walk
They bloggin' bout these hoes,ain't trust none of you hoes
I'm plugged up, connected, I'm drugged up on Texas
My homeboys some Mexicans, yo girlfriend went missin'
You talkin' money, I ain't listenin
These Ferragamos not Fendi
Money comin' back like tennis, when they touchdown, we winnin'
