[Intro]
My love
My love
All night
I've been drunk and confused
All night
Wishin' I never made rules
All night
I'm so tired of bein' a fool
All night
What should I do?

[Chorus]
I know I said what I said, but that ain't what I mean
I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I know I said I was done, but that ain't what I mean
But I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I'll take you back, back, back
I'll take you back (mmm, mmm, mmm)
I'll take you back, back, back, oh, yeah, oh
I'll take you back
Back, back, back, b-b-back, back, back, back, back, back
All night

[Break]
Back, back, back, back
All night
Back, back, b-back, back, back
All night
Back, back, back, back
Take you back in the morning-ing-ing-ing
Back, back, b-back, back, back
All night
