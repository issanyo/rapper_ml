[Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's somethin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gon' hold it against ya, I'ma keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya, you can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my whoadie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singin' love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop actin'
Just another sad love song waitin' to happen

[Hook]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's somethin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 2: Future]
Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nuttin' 'bout no fame, he addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang, do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco, get them numbers for the low-low
Bigger the risk, the bigger the check, we watch for po-po
Make sure you keep your eyes on when you're drivin' down 1-0
That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin' with Coco
When you got hands like these you can count money with your eyes closed
When you spend cheese like this you send killers to niggas front door
Half of these niggas front fo', bitches for extra convo
Really plugged in with migo, go blind and still get c-notes

[Hook]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's somethin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
