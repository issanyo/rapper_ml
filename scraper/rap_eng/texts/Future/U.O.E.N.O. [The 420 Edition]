[Intro: Future]
U.O.E.N.O it
Ol' high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit only
You know what I’m sayin’?

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse 1: Yung Rudd]
U.O.E.N.O, just how hard he go
I'm talking hard as fuck, you go hard as Rudd? What weed you blow?
Cause that shit like a shoe, it must be laced
For you to say that. Not what's the case
Y'all be sweet, like custard tastes
BRB man, got a nug to face
Smoke shit, get high as a motherfucker
Ain't talking about your pops on a BWEE plane
Getting paper, ain't got time for no blood suckers
Go nuts on a track, make you never wanna see me sane
Puffing Mary, I need the Jane
Improve the flow, ease the brain
Higher than the bee gees sing
Spit and make my shit really bang
Trini boy, Carib moms, legend pops
Smoking on, level crops
Dropping bombs, level lots
Hot as kettles, pots

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2]
I live for bars
So I can cop 4 cars
Get four homes
That'll never foreclose
Plus I am for clothes
Want to buy, cause my fashion sense is amazing
Whether my girl or marijuana, you know a nigga be blazing [BANG!]
Shocking flow, no tasing [BANG!]
Lyrical devil, hell raising [BANG!]
I'm on that grass, like a field of cows just grazing [BANG!]
Haters words get around like a dirty whore
I'm trying to let them off easy - Section 34
But my conscience it speaks
Your attitude it reeks
All it does is gas me up, like I'm going to Peake's
I'm trying to reach my peak
And make mills like Meek
So circles is what I will rap around your head, like Sikhs
You don't even know

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 3: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin', you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it
