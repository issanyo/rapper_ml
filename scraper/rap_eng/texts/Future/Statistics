[Intro: Big Rube]

[Hook: Future]
Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worses

[Verse 1: Future]
For statistics and what they said I’m a rich nigga
Some niggas get money go to feds get out rich nigga
My uncle left came back to the streets and got his check
Presidential Rolex, Versace specs, I’m flyer than a jet
Its in my flesh and bones I wake up on that strong
Fuck what you thank about it you think its wrong
You politicians politicin’ about niggas getting it
Making niggas successful you tryna make niggas stressful
Its a side of me to be a hot commodity
Fuck a robbery I take them on violently
For biting me I should sent my whole army
For making futuristic sounds so corny

[Hook: Future]
Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worses

[Verse 2: Future]
Bitch ass niggas smell like a dust
Wack ass friends gone fuck around and expose you
Nobody to hand around school of swag and jackers
Got your cap and gown go around sniffin’ real niggas down
The green light on you in own just to lay you down
Smoking out a pound waiting on a call about a clown
Money on your forehead fuck you lil niggas kickin’ big talk
Fuck that small talk turn a loft to a vault
4s Panamera Turbo Porsche
Do it for my niggas in the streets of course, with no choice
But you go and get that mula fetti no choice
But you go and get that mula fetti no choice

[Hook: Future]
Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worses
