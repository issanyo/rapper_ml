Young Chop on the beat
BandKamp!

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, it’s crazy cause, man, it was like…
I saw, one of the guys shootin' on the corner
Damn, nigga, this nigga really shootin' on the corner (yeah, yeah)
All the little kids MONTANA, everybody runnin'
He shot the whole van up, and I’m like damn
And we dipped

[Chorus: C.A.S.H.]
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
Fo real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas enter me
I ain't scared to die nigga, huh
I'll take your life nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down nigga
A hundred rounds'll put you down, nigga

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana, ay
I be the hottest nigga out my city (Hah)
Hit you with some shit, you never stayed O-50 (Hah)
Know a nigga shine, all my diamonds pretty (Hah)
I hit a lick, I'm worth a couple million (Hah)
That car net worth 400 thou nigga
That top drop like Pacquiao nigga (whoop)
I hit up K.O.D. and left a hundred there
And a hundred on my watch I'm shining every minute
They caught him on that corner, left a hundred in him
And these niggas goin' broke, that'll never be me (HAAAH)
Paranoia (paranoia), got me watchin' lawyer (lawyer)
Molly water (Molly water), tryna wake up sober (Hah)

[Chorus: C.A.S.H.]
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
Fo real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas enter me
I ain't scared to die nigga, huh
I'll take your life nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down nigga
A hundred rounds'll put you down, nigga

[Verse 2: French Montana]
And I made a mill in 30 minutes
And I'm ridin', clip with 30 in it
And your head, I put 'bout 30 in it
When - when them shots hit him, it choppa down, nigga
I been sober, paranoia
That baking soda, could help yo boy out
Get your head blown off, your body for a verse (Hah)
When the chopper hit 'em, niggas yellin' holla mercy
Bloody murder, go and dig the dirt out
Choppers ringin', don't you let 'em get a word out
Probably talkin' 'bout nothin' you done heard 'bout
Niggas gettin' smoked, bitches gettin' turned out

[Chorus: C.A.S.H.]
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
Fo real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas enter me
I ain't scared to die nigga, huh
I'll take your life nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down nigga
A hundred rounds'll put you down, nigga
I be so (I be so) paranoid (paranoid)
I hear these niggas tryin' to fuck with me
Fo real shit, I know I got enemies
I can't let them niggas enter me
I ain't scared to die nigga, huh
I'll take your life nigga
Fuckin' shoot 'em down nigga
A hundred rounds'll put you down, nigga
