[Chorus]
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
But it sound more fly to ya
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
I swear it sound way fly to ya
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth gonna hurt you
The truth gon' hurt you

[Verse 1]
I live a California lifestyle
All dez girls around me, don’t know why
And I’m so caught up in my own style
I can’t see you niggas in the crowd
I’m so far, ain’t gonna never come down
You can ask around, I run the town
Every day for me, a fashion show
I’m Future Hendrix and I run Pluto
I’m a rockstar forever, I need to get my act together
We’re changin’ up the weather, it’s so hard to be settle
Since we first got together
Things changed for the better
I got die heart fans and dey treat me very special
Heard about forty bitches in the lobby
Ask me about it, hold nobody

[Chorus]
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
But it sound more fly to ya
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
I swear it sound way fly to ya
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth gonna hurt you
The truth gon' hurt you

[Verse 2]
Im on a the first class flight
Ain't pack a bag over night
Cause I'mma shop when I land
Yea, I'mma shop when I land
When you playin’ with them band
5 Suite hotel, thats all where we stayin
Don’t frustrate
N I been up late
(Just thinkin’ of shit nawmean)
Goin’ over my plans
Feel like sinkin in sand
Some Things you wouldn’t understand
I live the high life
Sex, syrup n money
Everything we do we do it alway’ to the mornin
I got a trio, tryna suck me up like cheetos
Ain’t fallin’ lust
You need to trust like I tell you

[Chorus]
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
But it sound more fly to ya
I didn’t wanna lie to ya
I swear it sound way fly to ya
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth gonna hurt you
The truth gon' hurt you
