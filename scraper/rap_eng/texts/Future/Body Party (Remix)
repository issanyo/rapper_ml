[Intro: Future]
It's just me and you
Girl it's just me and you
We make a movie, no edit
Everything about your body, my fetish
You hear me calling you
I know you hear my body calling you
911, emergency
Tell 'em my heart need surgery

[Verse 1: Ciara]
My body, is your party, baby
Nobody's, invited, but you, baby
I can do it slow now tell me what you want
Baby put your phone down, you should turn it off
Cause tonight it's going down, tell your boys it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop; oooooh oooh

[Hook: Ciara]
You can keep your hands on me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, ohhh

[Interlude: Ciara]
Boy you should know
That your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it
I want it all the time
Boy you should know
That your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you

[Verse 2: Ciara]
I can't lie, I won't lie, it's amazing
My faces go places, you're taking me
Baby take your time now, there's no need to rush
We can go another round if that's what you want
Cause tonight it's going down, yeah, you know it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop; ooooh ohhhhh

[Hook: Ciara]
You can keep your hands on me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, ohhh

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I said what you wanna do? What you gonna do?
You know I don't come empty handed and you know I contribute
I just wanna spend one night with you, hit the party like it's '92
I said let's get straight to the point that's just mine point of view
I said since you walked into the door, you hit the floor, now that the feelings arrived
Now we feeling the zone, we feeling the vibe, vibe, vibe
I said all we do is this, we ain't dancing no mor, glass in my hand, and my pants Polo
A night like this and you can't be solo
You should remember that life is for that's living the most, most

[Outro: Ciara]
The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party
Let's get it started
