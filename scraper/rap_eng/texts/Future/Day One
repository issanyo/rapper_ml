[Intro: Future]
I'm in this bitch with Yo
We on that millionaire shit, we can't be worrying bout none of that broke business, you feel me

[Hook: Future]
I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie (yeah!)
You better come at me correct cause you don’t know me (turn up!)
A half a million round my neck, I'm still the old me (skrt!)
I’m on that sour, nigga, I ain't movin' slowly
Hey! Hey! I got that check on me, I've been like that from day one
I keep my niggas with me, I've been like that from day one
I drive the newest whips, I've been like that from day one (skrt skrt!)
I made that gwala flip, I've been like that from day one (br-br-brt)

[Verse 1: Future]
I'm on promethazine, my coupe the color Akon
I got my hoodie on, ain't goin' not like Trayvon
I'm on my hustle, since a young I learned to stay down
I got young Nino with me and he shoot up playgrounds
Put VVS's and my watch is presidential
If I fuck yo bitch you tell me can you keep it confidential?
Ain't no pressure on my presidents, these Franklins are official
And my coupe is so official, riding round with all my pistols
30 round that clip from since the day one
I add-on all my whips, I never trade one
I'm doing 100 miles I'm on the streets and I ain't racin'
I drive the most expensive cars
That's very fast and very spacious
Aye look at these niggas, they all shooters
We came from the bottom, we eat noodles (woo)
Very bad bitches on my radar
You are not a real nigga, nigga you’s a hater

[Hook: Future]
I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie (yeah!)
You better come at me correct cause you don't know me (turn up!)
A half a million round my neck, I'm still the old me (skrrt!)
I'm on that sour, nigga, I ain't movin' slowly
Hey! Hey! I got that check on me, I've been like that from day one
I keep my niggas with me, I've been like that from day one
I drive the newest whips, I've been like that from day one (skrt skrt!)
I made that gwala flip, I've been like that from day one (br-br-brt)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Cuban link I'm rockin' cost two hunned (Shit two hunnda)
Gas prices high, (whew) Exxon (Gas!)
All white foreigns, make em hate some (They hate!)
Designer clothes, look like I shop in London (I might)
I got that yellow AP, different from my old one (shit different)
You talk that plug talk but nigga you don't know one (Trippin')
I'm one hundred dawg, I stand out from no one (Gotti)
Bought a brick from me, I sold him a fake one (finesse)
I take so many, been like that from day one (finesse)
Up off with them Cubans and them Haitians (sak pasé)
I fuck with them gangstas and them killers (killas)
I know bitches realer than you niggas (I do)
I know the streets gon' be the streets (I do)
Fuck niggas don't deserve to eat (they don't)
And it been that day since day one (day one)
If a nigga get wrong I'mma spray some
Hundred round draw, house look like Graceland, king

[Hook: Future]
I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie (yeah!)
