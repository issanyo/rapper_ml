[Intro]
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Pluto

[Chorus]
I get to these racks consistently
Who gon' stop me now?
They keep talkin', I'm talkin' 'bout drugs
'Bout to pop one now
I just cashed out on two-door Maybach
Who talkin' now?
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out

[Verse 1]
I put a pool on top of the penthouse
You can see me now
I'm still high from the day before
'Bout to re-up now
Nigga was broke some years ago
Fuck around, lose a cap
Had the stewardess on the PJ
And she chewed me out
I was always in some shit
Nigga, look at me now
These bitches will have me lookin' bad
Tryna air me out
Then I gave that bitch some cash
Over a fair amount
Ain't gon' never trust a bitch
Who can't close they mouth

[Chorus]
I get to these racks consistently
Who gon' stop me now?
They keep talkin', I'm talkin' 'bout drugs
'Bout to pop one now
I just cashed out on two-door Maybach
Who talkin' now?
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out

[Post-Chorus]
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
I just fucked up me a check

[Verse 2]
They keep talkin' 'bout, I'm talkin' 'bout racks
'Bout to pop one now
Most of these niggas all whack
They 'bout to get knocked off now
I done went way past the quota
Shit, I lost account, yeah
Pulled up, turbo on a motor
It was unannounced
Make the Forbes' once again
The talk of the town
I got Snow White on the seat
Shit, I'm droppin' it down
I put good dope on this beat
I'm 'bout to take some now
They keep talkin' 'bout, I'm talkin' 'bout jewelry
'Bout to buy some now

[Chorus]
I get to these racks consistently
Who gon' stop me now?
They keep talkin', I'm talkin' 'bout drugs
'Bout to pop one now
I just cashed out on two-door Maybach
Who talkin' now?
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out

[Post-Chorus]
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
I just fucked up me a check

[Verse 3]
Get, get your money, get your weight up
Just like a shark, dog get ate up
I been told, another demeanor
I been frozen, another demeanor
Got more lights than a arena
Hit 'em on sight for the subpoena
Pull, pull up a new Lamborghini
What's the total? You can keep the receipt
I can dap up Curry sittin' in my seat, yeah
I give her allowance three times a week, yeah
I'm out your league, yeah

[Chorus]
I get to these racks consistently
Who gon' stop me now?
They keep talkin', I'm talkin' 'bout drugs
'Bout to pop one now
I just cashed out on two-door Maybach
Who talkin' now?
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out

[Post-Chorus]
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
Bitch, I'm ballin' out
I just fucked up me a check
I just fucked up me a check
