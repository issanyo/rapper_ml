[Intro: Future]
I let the goons drive the Lambo
Twenty choppers like I'm Rambo (Montana, Hendrix!)
I'ma always keep that carbon on me
A million cash with a bad one on me
Fuck you mean nigga
Richest nigga in the world
He was jammin' with that Lambo on me
Tried to kill me left me traumatized
A nigga looking for an alibi
That homicide had me traumatized
I'm just looking for an alibi
I'm just looking for an alibi
These bad bitches don't mean shit to me
Never let your bitches get to me

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Pray for me got it tatted on me
Switching lanes up in the 'Rari
Drinking lean getting high
And fuck them hoes for another night
Drinking lean got me with this shit
Chasing all this money got me with the shit
Fuck them hoes they got with the shit
And fuck them niggas they be with the shit

[Bridge: Future]
Pull up in foreigns that's the life we love
Pull up in foreigns that's the life we love
Pull up in foreigns that's the life we live
You getting money wake up to a bill

[Chorus: French Montana  & Future]
Miley Cyrus got me whipping shit
Miley iley got me out of here
Miley Cyrus got me whipping shit
Miley iley got me out of here
Swear to God we'll never change
Swear to God we'll never change
I'm just looking for an alibi
That homicide left me traumatized

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Try to get it they was laughing
Cop the European press the gas
All my diamonds flashy
Was hustling by the pole got me bi-polar
Couldn't Michael Jordan so I J. Coled
I left the beaker hit the baking soda
Came with some real niggas to take it over
All this money on me, all this money on me
Never let these pussy niggas take it off on me
'Cause everything but my phone on 100%
'Cause everything but my phone on 100%

[Chorus: French Montana  & Future]
Miley Cyrus got me with the shit
Miley iley got me out of here
Miley Cyrus got me with the shit
Miley iley got me out of here
Swear to God we'll never change
Swear to God we'll never change
I'm just looking for an alibi
That homicide left me traumatized

[Outro: Future & French Montana]
I let the goons drive the LamboTwenty choppers like I'm Rambo
I'ma always keep the carbon on me
A million cash with a bad one on me
Fuck you mean nigga richest nigga in the world
Got the strap in the Lambo on me
Chinx homicide left me traumatized
Went and got the doors suicide
And hide until I see you on the other side
I let my goons drive the Lambo
100 choppers like I'm Rambo
And I'm gon' always keep the carbon on me
A hundred cash got a bad one on me
Pray for me got it tatted on me
Switching lanes up in the 'Rari
Drinking lean getting high
And fuck them hoes for another night
