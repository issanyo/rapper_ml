Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, mask off
Mask on, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a
Don't chase no

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, thatâ€™s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, mask off
Mask on, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a
Don't chase no
