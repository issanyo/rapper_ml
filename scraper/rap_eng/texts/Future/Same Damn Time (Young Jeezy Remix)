[Chorus: Future]
I rock Gucci I rock Bali at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Young on the remix he goin crazy
Is that a hermes belt that shit is crazy
Both the rarri and the harley got the same damn pipes
If i stack up all these hunnits, itd be the same damn height
Every time i see her out she with the same damn dikes
Bad bitches on deck, we got the same damn likes
Drinkin sprite, wearing coatless at the same damn time
Every the nigga holla, he want the same damn nine
So i chop him like im nino brown
Wear him like im hatian jack
All i blow is cash nigga show me where the station at
Yall act like yall and feeling this but personally im killin this
Niggas talk that yayo shit but personally im into it
Yeah i said my earrings cool but personally they ignorant
Personally they ignorant
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Chorus: Future]
I rock Gucci I rock Bali at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm in fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite, trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that activis, it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iphone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
Vvs and white stones, vvs and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free bands on al capone
And my cash way long, (turned up)
I see a bunch of clones

[Chorus: Future]
I rock Gucci I rock Bali at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

[Verse 2: Future]
Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside crim
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louie gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

[Chorus: Future]
I rock Gucci I rock Bali at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
