[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I'm a Chanel junkie (A junkie), I'm a Chanel junkie (Junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Double C), I'm a Chanel junkie (Junkie)
I got some bread on me (The bag), I got the feds on me (Woo)
I want that lean, buy the whole thing
I got some red on me
I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo), I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo), I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo)
Used to have Louis V dreams (Woo), now I'm a double C fiend (Woo)
I got a thing for Supreme
I'm drippin' clean up the scene (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Take notes, jot it up (Jot it)
Drop the work, rock it up (Rock it)
Shittin' on 'em, I stopped it up (Up)
Hit a lick, plotted up (Cash out)
Chanel myself, Chanel my daughter
Chanel my bitch, that cost me a quarter
She like "You love me?" I'm like "Sort of"
I'm at Chanel, you over in Zara
I got some drugs on me (Drugs on me)
I got the mud on me (My pain on me)
I walk in the shower
Jacuzzi or bath, I got a tub on me (Water)
Just copped a Chanel with the blue stripes
They fit a lil' snug on me
She blowing me up, with her call and text
She wanna fuck on me (Love on me)
I keep it fire, I'm Hell (Hell)
I catch a bomb, Odell
You pussy boy, female (Ha)
About your bitch? Oh, well (So)
I'm a fiend, gotta keep Chanel on me
(It's sometimes you gotta have it, I'm tellin' you)
I get high off shopping like amphetamines
Outta season, bought a mink in the Spring (Chanel)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Double C)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Junkie)
I got some bread on me (A bag), I got the feds on me (Woo woo)
I want that lean, buy the whole thing
I got some red on me (Drank on me)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo), I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo), I'm a Chanel junkie (Woo woo)
Used to have Louis V dreams (Woo), now I'm a double C fiend (Woo)
I got a thing for Supreme
I'm drippin' clean up the scene (Mop it up)

[Bridge: Future]
Chanel junkie, junkie, junkie
Junkie, junkie, junkie
Got them balls jumpin'
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Got these bands comin'
Comin', comin', comin', comin'
I'm a Chanel junkie, junkie
Junkie, junkie, junkie, junkie, junkie

[Verse 2: Future]
Gon' have to put up, we shuttin' it down, down, down
Chanel my chain, it's hangin' way down
Down, down, down, down
I got some bread on me (On me)
Hi-Tech red on me (Hi-Tech red only)
I got grease and I'm a boss
These bitches stayin' on me (Bitch stayin' on me)
I got this purple aura
I got Chanel, it's so insane
I need to eat the bullet (Bullet), how they troll, how they bite
Order more cases of bubbly
I pass it out to your fantasy (I pass it out)
Just on that I spent your salary
I told her "Thank you for having me"

[Outro: Moneybagg Yo & Future]
I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Chanel junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Chanel junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Chanel junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Chanel junkie)
I got some bread on me (Junkie, junkie, junkie, junkie)
I got the feds on me (I got the feds on me)
I want that lean on me, I got some red on me
(I got that red on me)
I'm a Chanel junkie, I'm a Chanel junkie (I'm a Chanel junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie (Junkie, junkie, junkie, junkie, junkie)
I'm a Chanel junkie
Used to have Louis V dreams (Junkie ued to have Louis V)
Now I'm a double C fiend (Now, I'm a double C fiend)
I got a thing for Supreme (I got a thing)
I'm drippin' clean up the scene (Drip, drip, drip)
Clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, drip, clean it up, clean
Mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up
Clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up, clean it up
Mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up, mop it up
