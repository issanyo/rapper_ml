[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci Mane, my teacher said I'm failing math
All this money, how the fuck I'm failing math?
It's Gucci Mane, my teacher said I'm failing math
All this money, how the fuck I'm failing math?
It's Gucci Mane, my teacher said I'm failing math
All this money, how the fuck I'm failing math?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I put on all my jewelry just to blind myself
Since I'm the CEO, I might as well sign myself
Red bottoms on my feet, I call 'em Spike Lees
I'm sitting court side next to Spike Lee
I bought my bitch a 'Vette and told her, take it or leave it
Broke up the next day with her, told her she can keep it
She see too much, so she gotta keep a secret
And if she try to tell then I'ma leave her paraplegic
I spent 200,000 on a pinky ring
Then got it back by selling niggas collard greens

[Hook: Future]
We driving cars we can barely pronounce
Drinking on lean and we need to slow down
Business is booming, please call my accountant
Shut down your town anytime we touch down
We driving cars we can barely pronounce
Drinking on lean and we need to slow down
Business is booming, please call my accountant
Shut down your town anytime we touch down

[Verse 2: Future]
Yeah the whip come from Italy
The bitch come from Italy
The gun come from Germany
The lean from the pharmacy
Medicine inside my Sprite
Favorite color, green and white
Red bottom with the spikes
Rastafari, shot to life
Go to Kingston on the ganja
With a bitch from California
Take a sniff of the tree
That's a rich nigga aroma
Lean got me in a coma
Xans have ya in the clouds
Riding in 200 thou
Smelling like a bag of loud

[Hook: Future]
We driving cars we can barely pronounce
Drinking on lean and we need to slow down
Business is booming, please call my accountant
Shut down your town anytime we touch down
We driving cars we can barely pronounce
Drinking on lean and we need to slow down
Business is booming, please call my accountant
Shut down your town anytime we touch down
