[Intro]
We 'bout to win so big
Talkin' 'bout hydraulic money, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Money comin' in
Tell me what's the program
Twenty-five bags of kush
Yeah, get with the program
Shawty want that wave
Get the program
Shawty want that wave
What's the program
Throwing through the yay
What's the program
Fucking up the check
What's the program
I just blowed a bag
What's the program
I just went shopping
What's the program

[Verse 1]
Obama on my line
What's the program
You know I don't give a damn
What's the program
I go out the way
That's the program
My lingo far away
That's the program
Different color bags
That's the program
I don't fuck with swag
That's the program
Too much damn charisma
But what's the program
Sizzle, that's my nigga
What's the program
Choppers and them AR's
That's the program
AR with the nuts
That's the program
Extendo FN

[Chorus 2]
Fucking up the check

[Bridge]
My BFF that cash
That's the program

[Verse 2]
Every nigga 'round me a gangbanger
Ain't hollywood bitch
I'm too famous
Never talk to the pink paranoia, fuck
I just popped six Xans on a Quaalude
Shawty gave me head on that Adderall
G-wagons and Rovers, yeah I bought it for her
Metro told me hit them with the slow flow
Sizzle in the cut with the fo-fo
Lot of money make a bitch evil
That's why I gotta keep a desert eagle

[Chorus 2]
Fucking up the check
What's the program
I just blowed a bag
What's the program
I just went shopping
What's the program
Shawty want that wave
What's the program
Married to this money
What's the program
Married to this trap
What's the program
Married to the trap
What's the program
Married to the trap
