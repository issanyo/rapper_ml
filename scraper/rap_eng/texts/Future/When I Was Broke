[Intro]
Yeah, she ain't leave when I was broke
I used to sit at the trap all day and wait for a phone call
She ain't leave when I was broke
Juugin and finessin'
She ain't leave when I was broke
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
I don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she won't
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

[Verse 1]
Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
That I change up your location
That I pull up in that Wraith
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
I don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she won't
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

[Verse 2]
We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)
She understand everything I go through
Gutta nigga always

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
I don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she won't
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

[Outro]
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke
