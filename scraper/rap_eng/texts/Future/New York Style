[Verse 1: Future]
Yo this ain't no conspiracy nor is it a theory
Because a theory is a story that's been planned from the beginning
All these lies I be hearing
That keep my head spinning
When I'm searching for the truth I don't talk I just listen
Yo niggas in my hood love it when I'm tripping
Putting bottles in my face and they tell me to keep sipping
Try to throw me with the fishes and you'll end up getting cuts on your skin like a chicken in the kitchen
Yo Future's what they call me you can't predict it
I dare you to control me, ya nigga's is phony
Lonely is how you'll end up in the morning
6 feet deep looking up at your coffin
Look at my crew and you know that we mobbing
Your watch and your chain on neck what we robbing
Don't care if the dude type big and brolic
I'm not being modest just being logic

[Verse 2: Sire]
Mentally unstable got the doctor's note
So high every time I fucking cough there's smoke
See you niggas get fly but I stay on float
And spit enough to motha fuckin drown your boat
Bitch you couldn't stop me even if you wanted to
Straight shittin' on the game never number two
This rap shit is way too easy
Steady spit fire I'm way too greasy
I'm nasty bitch what if I ever gave a fuck
I'd chop my middle finger off
And finger pop ya broad wit 'em
So sick that he keep his Clinic Card wit 'em
Swag on cancer flow gon kill 'em
Find a spark in ya brain I ignite the flame
Till I blow ya mind call me Kurt Cobain
Haze stickier than spider web
Her name Mary Jane
And if these niggas wanna hang then Saddam Hussain

[Verse 3: Rewind]
Yaves Records on the move our life is like a movie
Shine in the studio no homo but I do
When I say something people do it call me Simon
Rewind the truth so you know I'm never lying
I should be a criminal spit nothing but bars
Verses causing fire (you hear that that's the alarm)
It should be a ringtone its what people recall
Catch me in the court but I'm only playing ball
A beast on the loose not caged not tamed
Popping up balloons when I gassed the game
Helium Bryant or Hydrogen James
Niggas talking L's I thought it stood for lames
Times is getting hard but we just got to hustle
Life is like a game make sure you catch the fumble
When shit happens I kick it to side
Pockets over flowing watch out for the tide
