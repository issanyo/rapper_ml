[Hook: Future]
24, 24/7
I done ran sack up, aww man (aww man)
I just poured the drank up, aww man (poured the drank up)
I done turnt them hoes up, aww man (aww man)
Had the whole city screaming "Aww man" (aww man)
We done seen a lot of shit, never had it (never had it)
So you get money, boy, you know you capping (know you capping)
I ain't show you how to do it, aww man (aww man)
Got the whole city screaming "Aww man"

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
When I pull up all the
Bitches be like God damn
Got 'em turnt in the club
Like that's our jam
My neck and my wrist full of diamonds
My clothes come straight from designers
I told Future pull out the Wraith
Let's flex and finesse for the cameras
I'm just gon' pour up the syrup
I dropped a four in the Fanta
I told that lil' bitch give me head
She said "Boy, where is your manners?"
I need two hoes
24/7, ay
I keep two poles
All my niggas felons, ay

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Whippin' that work like a spatula
I stay up late like I'm Dracula
I keep the keys like a janitor
Holla at me, fuck a manager
You think you Tony Montana huh?
Heard you be sniffing the Hanna, huh?
AR-15, it'll damage ya
Make you do flips off the banister
All of my young niggas shooters
I got a bitch work at Hooters
I do not fuck with you Brewfords
Extended clip look like rulers
She see my neck now she like "aww man"
Pockets be full of that aww man
I'm gone off a Xan and she can't understand me
I'm too high to care 'bout what y'all saying'
