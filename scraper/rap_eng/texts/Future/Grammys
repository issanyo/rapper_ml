[Intro: Future]
Hey why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You acting like you fucking won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up

[Hook: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm err off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Verse 1: Future]
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

[Hook: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm err off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Verse 2]
Boatloads of that nina white
Got Madonna comin' in on a private flight
I went in on the whole time
They goin' crazy bout the new ice
Homie still talkin' old times
We ain't too impressed by the old hype
Young gunna with your head now he gonna knock it off for the new hype
Fishscale in my blind sight
Been a visionary from the start
I'm the type to give away the limelight
20 cars in my new garage
Got em laying out like a club night
My Oakland homie told I'm "hella tight"
My hippie homie told me take a flight
Future need to go and take the acid
Future need to go and take the shrooms
Standin' on the sofa drinkin' Dom Perignon, strapped up with the Uzi
Step aside when I'm on the move
Pay attention cause I got the juice
You can feel my presence in the room

[Hook: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm err off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
