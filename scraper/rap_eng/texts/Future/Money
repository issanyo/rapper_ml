[Kid Whiz: Hook]
Money man, money man
I've always been a money man, money man
Checks into a Benjamin, Benjamin
20 to a 100 grand, comprehend (2x)
Cuz I'm all about the dough

[Verse 1: Future]
Flow fresh, and is disgusting
Y'all niggas fake and I'm hustin'
I'm getting cake and it frustrates you
I'm gettin' money and I love you
You a hatin' nigga, you a cartoon
To a real nigga, you is not a goon
Two cups of that good drink
That's codeine, I'm on the move
I'm sippin' on some sizzurp
My wrist is on a blizzard
My niggas out a blizzard
You need to get your bitch searched
She gettin' on my nerves
She fuckin' with my hotdog
I'm an astronaut and I'm a NASA
I'm a rockstar and no guitar
Pullin' up with 'em racks, dog
You got Kreayshawn, you can sudoku
I got more drugs, I got more dope
I get more flow and go loco
You know Soso, you know Pablo?
You know Diego, you get pesos?
Pedro, you know Mexicans
You know Colombians and you staged, bro

[Hook]

I said I’m all about that money, get my cash my flow
Dollars on the counter, I don’t count them, I just get more
Put em' in the duffle bag by the Mac, rubber bands on bands
I’m a bandit, bumping the raw
Deliver you a detrimental hit to the game
They don’t want that shit
Pack of the loud and I’m on
Stronger than medicine ball
Sweating way out of my pores and I’m needing a medic because I am venomous sicker than medicine ever could fix
Fuck with the venomous kid
You will be leaving with hits
And a million plaques on the wall
Platinum so they never fall
Plaques on the wall
Back to the damage, I’m racking up hay makers
Get your pace maker, not a day later
By the morning I’m already working on the next groove
Future got the best Woo!
