[Intro]
You can't tell me you got no love for me, no
You can't tell me you ain't got no love for me, no

[Verse 1]
I done ran into a few complications
Promise me you'll always stay dedicated
You gotta promise me you'll never be scared of love no more
You took the vows, for better or for worse
Please baby, please baby, please
Gave me reason to believe in my dreams
Give me love, that's what I need, that's what I need
I'll travel through time, I walked the line and overseas

[Bridge]
Before we do anything, we're doing us
I didn't have no more patience, I was in a rush
I fell in love with music, just like us
You work at Magic, baby can you love me?
You see the moon comin' out at night
I got a wolf standin' by my side
We do these girls three at a time
I'm in my world, I'm out of time
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
Look in my eyes, you see my trials
You see my tribulations, I was down
I seen the sweat running down the wall
We tryna have a good time
We toastin' it up at the juke joint
Sit by the bar at the juke joint
Made love in the car at the juke joint

[Pre-Hook]
I'm standin' in the middle of an orgy
I put a smile on a whore bitch
I feel like my life is completed
I feel like it's timin' with everything

[Hook]
I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night, it's a portrait

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm rappin' this
When I know I shouldn't be doin' this
Hopin' that the end results
I don't aim to ruin this
Palm trees influenced this
Chronic trees influenced this
Tootsies in Miami
These girls, they influence this
The JW Marriott in Dubai, it influenced this
Take a few laps on the horses before the sun sets
And I can see it from my window
I can see this from my window

[Hook]
I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night, it's a portrait

[Bridge]
Before do anything, we're doing us

[Hook]
I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
