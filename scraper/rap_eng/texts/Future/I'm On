[Intro: Future]
The rich way
You know what I mean, I'm full of this shit ya digg
It's dripping all over me (Pluto)
Yeah, tell you like this

[Chorus: Future]
I'ma ride for the gang if you right or wrong
But you can buy a Benz with the shit I'm on
You gon' get some watches with the shit I'm on
Sipping on lean, I got kush cologne
Young nigga catching bodies, ready to squeeze
Young nigga tote them dracos with the beam
Wrist glisten, bitch put me on blast
I got thirty-six, that's a straight glass on me
Keep it specific, we all we got
Heads up finessing is all we got
Trapping and rapping, we all we got
Percs and the molly ain't all we got
Diamonds and Raris ain't all I got
Got a new safe, that ain't all I got
Sixty K on me now but this ain't all I got

[Verse 1: Casino]
Sixty K on a new watch, that's nothing to me
Push start on the whips, I'm in a foreign you see
This chick got a wig on, think she foreign
Got a model bitch on a sixteen hour flight here
Got six karats each ear
Drink lean like water, having overdose fear
I'm in the game, boy I'm private
Fly is back, nigga you know
I don't need no stylist
Taliban like a chain
Freebandz we rich

[Chorus: Future]
I'ma ride for the gang if you right or wrong
But you can buy a Benz with the shit I'm on
You gon' get some watches with the shit I'm on
Sipping on lean, I got kush cologne
Young nigga catching bodies, ready to squeeze
Young nigga tote them dracos with the beam
Wrist glisten, bitch put me on blast
I got thirty-six, that's a straight glass on me

[Verse 2: 550]
Thirty-six ounces of the glass, that's a brick on me
Lamborghini Raris with the bag, got the stick on me
Riding with the game, all these shrimps, I'm a big homie
10K small pieces, VVS's diamonds only
Pistol grip them diamonds on it, regular Rollie, put diamonds on it
No use for time to shine just shining only
Like my swag and tryna clone it
Ten different drugs in my system, I could've bought a Benz
Iced up my neck and the crew, my niggas tryna win
Still serving drugs in them packs, swipers they buying Benz
Co-selling ass in the club, how much you tryna spend?
That's new wave, buy a new car, you buy a new K
Paper trail, Freebandz Gang, that's gang gang

[Chorus: Future]
I'ma ride for the gang if you right or wrong
But you can buy a Benz with the shit I'm on
You gon' get some watches with the shit I'm on
Sipping on lean, I got kush cologne
Young nigga catching bodies, ready to squeeze
Young nigga tote them dracos with the beam
Wrist glisten, bitch put me on blast
I got thirty-six, that's a straight glass on me
Keep it specific, we all we got
Heads up finessing is all we got
Trapping and rapping, we all we got
Percs and the molly ain't all we got
Diamonds and Raris ain't all I got
Got a new safe, that ain't all I got
Sixty K on me now but this ain't all I got
