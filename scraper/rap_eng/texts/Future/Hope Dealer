[Intro: Echelon Knoxx]
Okay i'm so much better at selling hope
Then selling dope
I'ts not a game
Hope Dealer

[Verse 1: Echelon Knoxx]
Yeah, before i sell my soul
I would sell a boat to peter storm i stay float
And i never sold a boat before
But i know it's real and i never been to hell before
And your lifetime there is certain sounds
You can't ignore
God is what i believe that's who i came for
I ain't in here for the bread but Lord know we poor
Opportunity knocks pray open that door
I'm a gold digger they throwing dirt on my clothes
Forgetting i'm a gold digger you know she certified[?]
When she getting gold with ya
On the road might just chopping
Out the dirty clothes with ya yeah
With God on my side i can never lose it was heaven or hell
I just had to choose never chase fake dudes
Never trust any one never trust the government[?}
Or them other dudes
God free america for they in jail
See my friends after new brands
They all in the cell
Sometimes be the haters that wish you well
I said they can take their
Wishes to a wishing well
For a while i was in my pride drinking cocktail
People telling my tales man get of my line
I hope you well I been real to real
I've been trill I got flow
Feeling ill getting hell but this is not a drill
I'm never can sell my soul
But i can sell you hope
I'm so much better at selling hope
Then selling dope
I'm so much better at selling hope
Then selling dope

[Outro: Future]]
And the truth is
Everybody seem dope
Looking for a fix but they don't know
They can't figure it out
They don't know what it is
But they want hope
And you can search every where
But i swear there is only one place
Where you can find that
So go ahead and push play
And one day it will be
Too late to rewind back
