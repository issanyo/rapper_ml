[Intro]
Ay, let me hit my cup, ew, shit taste nasty

[Verse 1]
Double cups and molly, codeine molly cyrus
I'm twisted and I'm faded, I'm po'ing up and I'm driving
She foreign and exotic
She a ride it like Ferrari
Give her this and let her pop it
Give her this and let her top ya
Let that girl win her a Oscar
We got commas, we got llamas
We got ice on Ferragamos
I got styrofoams and condoms
I got packs of blunts and loud, I got a big stack of them hundreds
Got baby bottles full of lean, I'm doped up and I'm stunting
I'm higher than the moon, I'm way up there in space
I'm sleeping with the toolie, I'm flexing with the K
I rather get ya girl geeked up, I don't like to go on dates
Put this inside ya cup if you don't like the taste

We higher than the moon, we floating like balloon
Everything in the sky, everything in Pluto
Everything in NASA, everybody round here trying to blast off
My glasses they pitch black, came in with them big racks
Our codeine's in a Gucci bag with a big gat, mismatched
Head to toe, designer
