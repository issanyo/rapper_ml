[Verse 1]
Really I'm a mothafuckin' drug dealer
Smoke me a blunt with some Blood niggas
I just dipped my whole 'Lac
I just bought my whole check
I don't do no old whips
But, I will fuck my old bitch
Done 'em down, don't spare that nigga
Catch him now, then air that nigga
Catch him down, then air that nigga
Sell some pounds with my migos and them
Then I go fuck on your bitch
I'ma just give her some star status
Niggas be actin' like bitches
Don't hang around, nigga, they too trashy
40 Glock, plastic, this shit can get too tragic
You wanna just get it, you gotta have it
We just bought the store, we don't carry bags
Nigga, might smoke a joint, throw a barbecue
You just caught your first body, dawg, I'm proud of you
My niggas like to drink syrup and serve dog food
I had to get my bag together 'fore I called you
Aye, stand on the corner a thousand days
Flippin' the money a thousand ways
Workin' and workin' for better days
Man, I'm workin' that work for some better days
Get that money, bae, then I elevate
Then I elevate, get that money, bae
Aquafina in my watch, oh yeah
Got some Aquafina in my watch, oh, yeah
That's a new Dominican, some Fiji pussy
That's that water, water, make me eat that pussy
Had the plugged in but I kept on lookin'
Had a 9-way and I keep on cookin'
I'm a self-made nigga, keep on lookin'
I'm a self-paid nigga, keep on lookin'
Got the white Benz and they think we're servin'
Bought the black Benz and they think we servin'
Got them goons with me and they secret service
Man these goon niggas like the secret service
When the club close, nigga, get to lurkin'
On them Sherm Sticks, I don't smoke no dirty
That's my OG like they hit that dirty
He a wild nigga, call him wild turkey
Wild niggas are hungry and thirsty
You a loud nigga, I ain't ever worried
Y'all niggas ain't ever worthy
Nah, y'all bitches ain't ever worthy

[Hook]
Al Sharpton on these hoes, yeah
Go Al Sharpton on these hoes, yeah
Hot boys, we go warfare
We some hot boys, we want warfare
Lost money, nigga, lost time, nigga
Bounced back, got more cheddar
More checks mean more cheddar
More checks, that's more cheddar

[Verse 2]
Park the car like a boat there
I'm gonna park the car like a boat there
Hotel, got your ho there
At the St. Regis, got your ho there
Top floor like a ballplayer
Fuck more bitches than a ballplayer
Fucked her friends on the ho, yeah
I went behind the back on that ho, yeah
Fucked her friends on the ho, yeah
I went behind the back on that ho, yeah
Tell me you didn't think I was gon' do it to you
Addicted to these bad, bad bitches
Addicted to these pain, pain pills
I just wanna lay it down, trill
A lesson from eye to eye contact, baby
I woke up to your girl, she was layin' butt naked
She thoroughbred, watch a nigga fall, settle
Pop a few Xans, then I fall in her
Show them diamond bands then I fall in her
Diamonds so big, look like they're fallin' off
Buzz so big, I ain't fallin' off
This spot too little, shit, wall to wall
I bent her over, instantly went wall to wall

[Hook]
Al Sharpton on these hoes, yeah
Go Al Sharpton on these hoes, yeah
Hot boys, we go warfare
We some hot boys, we want warfare
Lost money, nigga, lost time, nigga
Bounced back, got more cheddar
More checks mean more cheddar
More checks, that's more cheddar
