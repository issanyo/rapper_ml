[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
I been whippin' in this (kitchen) for some hours

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I got money, I got money
I bought freedom, I bought freedom
I earned my shit riding in them traps serving them geekers, serving them geekers
I bought a lawyer, I bought a lawyer
He beat them cases, He beat them cases
You should seen them dirty cracker racist faces, racist faces
And I walked outta court like Pac
Sold my last brick and bought a storefront on the block, on the block
Now I’m OG, now I'm OG
Niggas know me, niggas now me
But I don’t tolerate that conversate bout the ol’ me, bout the ol’ me
Ain’t no workin getting sold round here
If ya high partner don’t call my phone or come near
Outta here with that that fuck shit get from round here
Niggas like you and the feds usually come within a year
I don’t like you see I bought a few stores from my rivals
Now that ol’ money getting laundered up watch it cycle, watch it cycle
Bought my uncle’s company now I tow cars, now I tow cars
He made his first half a mil with Fred Tokars (with Fred Tokars)

[Chorus: Killer Mike + 2 Chainz]
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder (Yahhh)
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
[Yeah] I been whippin' in this (kitchen) (2 Chainz) for some hours

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
'Bout 14, I start selling nicks
By 15, I got a felony
By 16, I got my driver’s license start using J’s car to pedal lean
College Park that my stompin’ ground
Used to trap out the apartments
Got my baggies and digi scale
Bought a doll out the Starship
Got my first slab outta Bouldercrest
Got my second slab outta Bouldercrest
Got my third slab off of Bouldercrest
By my fourth slab I was paying rent
Mama said I was responsible
I was raised by Dr. Huxtable
I ain’t never been comfortable
Hot dogs and pork and bean lunchables
God Bless all my enemies
Got 2 buildings on Peters Street
3 studios and a day care
Crib in Florida don’t stay there
Just to show you where I came from
This the land of the bass drum
Grandmama was the Xan plug
Strip club got a fan club, ya dig!
Yeahhhhhhhh!

[Chorus: Killer Mike + 2 Chainz]
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder (Yahhh)
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
I been whippin' in this (kitchen) for some hours

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & 2 Chainz]
One time for the dope man dope man just last went up all kid coke man
Two time for the dope man dope man let your mama bum where your ass at coke man (Yahhhh)
Every Thanksgiving people get a turkey cuz the government looking at ‘em like they ain’t worth it
Politicians sending niggas off to prison while they actin like they reputation clean as detergent
We celebrate Pablo and Chapo, we don’t really give a fuck about a cop though
I’m a mover and a shaker I’m a real money maker and its known I used to sell cocaine (cocaine)
I’m a player I’m a player and the player know the mayor and the mayor know I know some thangs (some thangs)
When my cousin caught a case see the mayor was a counselor in college they whipped them thangs
I ain’t never had a plug named Julio
But I’m a tell you right now its who ya know
I ain’t never had a flight down to Mexico
But it took me 3 bricks to buy a CITGO
And a CITGO and a CITGO
Fat nigga went legit and got rich folks
Did what I had to do to get paid
Escape the game like a runaway slave

[Chorus: Killer Mike + 2 Chainz]
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder (Yahhh)
Black power, Black power, white powder, white powder
I been whippin' in this (kitchen) for some hours
