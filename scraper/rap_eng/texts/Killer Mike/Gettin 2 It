[Intro]
Yeah, it's Da Backwudz man
Got my homie Killa Kill from Adamsville, all the way stay to put it down, man let's tell em how we get it homie let's do it

[Verse 1: Big Marc]
What's my name? Big Marc
Hustle hard for the money
I'm jumpin' back triple while my player patna front me
East Atlanta star, chrome stips and it's old built
Guts, renovated wood kits and a face lift
Mash on the gas (Woo) pimpin' mack playa
Big get to it, what ya know about Decatur (Ohh)
Rollin' backwoods smokin' fried green tomatoes
Just send me bout a stack, you can take her out and date her

[Chorus]
All my hustlers in the trap
Get to it, Get to it
Flippin' money on the slab
Get to it, Get to it
Country girls on the flo'
Get to it, Get to it
Boy you already slow
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Eaaassstside
Get to it, on the
Weeeesstside
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Noooorrrthside
Get to it, on the
Soooouuuthside

[Verse 2: Sho Nuff]
Boy you already slow
Flip it watch it grow
26 inch tires
Plus suicide doors
Niggas hustle at the store, 365
Betty Crocker bakin' sellin' sweet potato pie
Raps sendin' money like Bam Bam Biggalo
Stacks to the ceiling, playin' with me like Picalo
Choosin' cause my neck glow
Different colored rainbow, gettin to it on the grind 10-4

[Chorus]
All my hustlers in the trap
Get to it, Get to it
Flippin' money on the slab
Get to it, Get to it
Country girls on the flo'
Get to it, Get to it
Boy you already slow
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Eaaassstside
Get to it, on the
Weeeesstside
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Noooorrrthside
Get to it, on the
Soooouuuthside

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Cook it, whip it, cut it, sack it (you know what it is)
Fuck what you heard, crack still sellin' (in the hood down here)
You owe them boys, better pay em (cause they don't forget)
They send them boys like Big Worm (to shoot up your crib)
Words rhyme but it ain't all rap
Them boys run up on ya put a sunroof in ya New Era ball cap
I got a gang of young head bustas, call em Lil' Scraps
Even at the skating rink, them young boys stay strapped
Fuck around let me give em that
AK-K-K, they be like, OK-K-Kay
Bust in yo Chevrolet
You set up shop in my residence
Al Sharpton stand a better chance of being voted first nigga for president

[Chorus](2x)
All my hustlers in the trap
Get to it, Get to it
Flippin' money on the slab
Get to it, Get to it
Country girls on the flo'
Get to it, Get to it
Boy you already slow
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Eaaassstside
Get to it, on the
Weeeesstside
Get to it, Get to it, on the
Noooorrrthside
Get to it, on the
Soooouuuthside
