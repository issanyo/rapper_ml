[Intro: Sample]
愛してよ　私を 抱いてよ　ねぇ、側においでよ
"Aishiteyo, watashi wo daite yo ne, soba ni oideyo"
私の　最後の　記憶に 君の愛を　残したい…
"Watashi no saigo no kioku ni kimi no ai wo nokoshitai"

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Polo to the floor though, you already know though
It's Adamsville for real, you see it, ho, just take a photo
I'm repping that Zone Four though with a .44 on your bro though
Cause that dodo thought that he could rob a playa for some dough though
I (Pff-pff-pff-pff), oh no! I'm so Allen Temple
I'm so English Manor, I'm so Misty Valley
And I gotta couple pounds yesterday out of Cali
And my bad bitch from the Valley brought me brand new Ballys
And I'm playin' with her nose, 'Merican Dream, Dusty Rhodes
Man, she been ridin' clean since her daddy rode on Vogues
I done fucked her in every hotel in every hole
I ain't fucked her with my wife, but if she meet her, might be a go
Woo! Ric Flair, Ric Flair flashy, bitch, don't I look dashin'?
Bitch, don't I look classy? Bitch, don't act so sassy
I'm the—I'm the man, boo; that's with or without you
To hell with what your mouth say, show me what that mouth do

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress it
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever
Hey, don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch I'm barely flexin'
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever
Live forever

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Daddy Fat Saxxx with three Xs, fuck niggas hit the exit
No S is on my chest but all these diamonds got me blessed
Usually I don't do this, dumb it down, go stupid
Since 17, been countin' Ms, my bank account's on Goofy
They say Cosby gave em roofies, now who know what the truth is?
Chicago's full of shooters, my garage is full of hoopties
Got that Southern drawl and all that
My pre-rolls look like ball-bats
The South got somethin' to say
And all y'all niggas can't get y'all ball back
If I ain't a hot boy then what do you call Saxxx?
Daddy Fat in it, y'all, never fall back (back?)
Like clocks in the wintertime, we stay eating like it's dinnertime
Been feasting and chiefing and blowing big
But it ain't no reefer rhyme
We don't know the meaning of drought
'Cause we keep it so wet, boy, I swear now it's been a while
Just speaking in general, boy, there is no formidable
Opponent or/and nigga that want it, pure uncut, never step on it
Line for line, dope when you want it
Mine the kind to give a nigga hope when they down and out
Nigga dig a hole so deep, ain't no climbing out

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress it
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever
Hey, don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch, I'm barely flexin'
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever
Live forever

[Outro: Rock D the Legend]
Yo, hoe, listen, just like I told Coco
My vision is pimpin', you already know though
So, go, hoe, stroll, hoe, fuck the po-po, that's my logo
Fo' sho, hoe, pogo, get-get down on the flo', hoe, flo' doe
Yo, hoe, listen, just like I told Coco
My vision is pimpin', you already know though
So, go, hoe, stroll, hoe, fuck the po-po, that's my logo
Fo' sho, hoe, pogo, now get down on the flo', hoe, flo' doe
On the flo', get down on the flo', hoe
On the flo', on the flo', get down on the flo', hoe
On the flo', on the flo', get down on the flo', hoe
