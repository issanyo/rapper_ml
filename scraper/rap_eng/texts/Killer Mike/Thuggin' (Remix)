[Intro: 2Pac]
The only way I've been practicing my whole life is to be responsible for what I do. I don't know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I don't know. Yes I am gonna say that I'm a thug, that's because I came from the gutter and I'm still here

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug, I hate payin' taxes
Just hate it, I'm tryna fuck a couple actresses
If I don't got it I'ma make it
Still don't got it, I'ma take it
Run that shit, take your shit, that's what I won't do
Out here doin' what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
That's the difference, I'm a mothafuckin' man
I'm a man, nigga, and as a man I don't take dick
I don't do Versace, that's that gay shit
Yeah I said it, I'm a thug
I'm a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin' hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lot of niggas say they're real, I'm the realest one
I'm the realest, this exactly how I'm feelin', bruh
Ain't no chillin', bruh

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I'm a thug, the conditions I'm living
It's got me condition for prison, the condition for killing
The condition that we put kids in, often poverty stricken
And even they're education becomes a pipeline to prison
Simply a tool used for mass incarceration
Call it the new plantation, call it new era slavery
Call the court system racist, call it just what it is
A plot and plan for paper that punish the poorest kids
O'Reilly, Hannity, Limbaugh, Geraldo know what it is
But they be on that fuck boy shit, blaming your kids
Don Lemon too, Wolf Blitzer three
I often wish I can have a sit down with every C and every B
And help them see we not enemies
And that includes fraternities with their college degree
I'm part drug kingpin mixed with Booker T
I'm whatever Blacks need me to be

[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
All that's an error, role model I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm marking the dance
I've seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce to get low, I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it

[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around
