[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

[Verse 1: El-P]
Anarchists put a flame to a tire, walk around with the fire round necks
Mankind gotta deal with a new kind of mind I'm a quick death wrapped in a threat
Tell these fuzzy little weak-heart bunny babies back up or get wet
Never mind where you draw the line, I got a mind for crime, it's all disrespect
I'm a oil rig fire in the flesh, you're a lunchbox walking erect
Tasty treats from the lungs to the flesh of the neck
Who's hungry? The table's set, come get it
Pain is a game then you better run with it, have fun with it, enjoy your suffering
Kernel panic, terminal rushin'
Empty the clip while your clip's still bufferin'

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Look in the eye of the violent and villainous
We are the murderous militants
We are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding
Marauding and murdering merchantmen
We have been cursed by the curs
We shooting first on our turf
Pay us our proper respect
You pray for your God to end the perverse
He sent the worst of the worst
Every death demon disperse
We put them all in a hearse
We put them under the earth
We are the savages ravaging hell
Death in the air, we relish the smell
We are the hand of the Lord
We are the hand with the sword
Taking the heads of the faith
We are the sealers of fate
We are the fangs of the snake

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

[Verse 3: El-P]
The enemies of the state
Pardon me, your mistake
See, I'm raised to eat pain
Appetite for sliced face
Me and Mike mount the Hellcat
Armed to the pearl-whites like yikes!
Twenty cents gets your ghost ejected
It's free now, go to the light
Me and Mike bring D'Lite to the knife fight
Get twenty-nine grand sliced
Me, I just take it light
Might light twenty-nine grand up in a night
Tongue lash slash in defiance
Born to brawl boy, the bastard alliance
Hardy-harr, you a laugh, I'm a riot
That's not a brag, that's SCIENCE!

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Back from the bellows of hell
Back from the back of a jail in the cell
Back from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed
Back to the streets from the East
Back to the belly of beast
Back to the place of my peace
Back to me holding my piece
Anything working disturbing that peace
Will certainly meet the deceased, capiche?
Oh, why must I tell 'em again?
What must I tell 'em, my friend?
That we are born into sin
And we are worshiping murderers
Nothing but evil duplicitous men
I know you heard of 'em all
We should just murder 'em all
We should just murder and ball
We dance on the ruins we looting from all of they palace's walls

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
