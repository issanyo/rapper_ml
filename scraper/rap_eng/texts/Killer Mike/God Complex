[Pulp Fiction sample]
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish
And the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
Those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."

[Killer Mike]
Heroin flow, y'all niggas heat your spoons up
The cocaine speech keep the audience geeked up
My dope boy flow turn good girls to freak sluts
Like crack in the 80s, the flow so crazy
You hit this, bitch it'll retard your baby
That promethazine queen got you listenin' lazy
I'ma stimulate you bitches, drive your heart rate crazy
Nigga see the flow brutal, it dilates pupils
So desperate for a hit a teacher sucked off a pupil
You heart it right, rewind nigga, listen again
I sent the bitch to rehab, made the kid a kingpin
And ain't no 12 steppin' this, bitch hit it again!
I deserve an indictment for the shit that I write when
I'm high as a motherfucker, burnin' and lightin'
I'm God, nigga, shit thunder, piss out lightning
My raps dirty like the piss pissed out by white men
In celebrity rehab, but this ain't rehab
When Danny Bonaduce check out of rehab
I'ma be right there, fat sack of crack
Sayin' first hits on me, here go a free gram
White girl, white girl, Tatum O'Neal
Suckin' dick to get a hit of that cocaine kill
For real, motherfucker I'm ill
I'm dope, I'm coke, I'm the new NyQuil
Like junkies with AIDS smokin' dope in Dixie Hills
Turnin' tricks and suckin' dicks just to live
My metaphors make a motherfucker's face go "Ew!"
Like stank on shit, my metaphors is real
Another Simpson Road saga, real life real girl
Daughter to a degenerate dope boy named Earl
Trap name was Squirrel
Cause all he did was chase them sluts
In the cuts and try to get nuts
Like these junkie ass rappers that you pay big bucks
These commercial ass niggas be industry sluts
To get ahead they give head and take it in their butt
But ain't no Raz B'ing me, I'm holding my nuts
You too l'il for this, young'n run and get me a Dutch
Nah make it a Swisher, I'm from the SOUTH, l'il nigga
And I'm fat, and I'm black and wear Polo religiously
Dope boy dress code, why you think these bitches be
All on me like I got a pocket full of ecstasy
Probably cause I got me a pocket full of ecstasy
4X's be right where the Ralph label be
Big dick, fat, fresh nigga, label me
I done fucked half the fine bitches in Decatur
I got a bitch in every Zone and three strippers in Zone 3
King Kong heroin dick on a bitch
She tie her leg, tap her vein and say poke and stick
Her best friend a dick fiend, chasing pipe dreams
She suck dick until her teeth showin' like crack fiends
Fuck your favorite rapper motherfucker, Mike' mean
Fuck your favorite rapper motherfucker, Mike' mean
Just a l'il violent
I'll see you motherfuckers next Sunday
Sunday Morning Massacre
Next time I won't be so late, motherfuckers
A l'il violence for your Sunday morning
BANG! BANG! BANG!
