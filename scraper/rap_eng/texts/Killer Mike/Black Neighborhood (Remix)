[verse 4: Killer Mike]
Blackstar, black car, black bitch
Same nigga raise a black fist
Put crack in a black fist
Yeah that's that black shit
Sold dope in front of your house
Still went to Morehouse, big Black shit
Bigger, blacker, bolder like ‘Shaft,’ bitch
Ain’t a cracker giving me the shaft, bitch
Nat Turner with a burner, he gonna need a graft, bitch
If black lives matter then you prove it
Grab a black Glock And make the copper face the music
They trying to tell me Mikey but your poppa was a copper
I tell them suck my dick because my auntie is Assata
And then I double down and tell them something twice as hard
Jesus is a fraud
The Black woman is God
Cause niggas ain’t no martyrs if you ain't got no Coretta’s
If you ain’t got no Betty’s and no Winnie Mandela’s
And if you don't respect her
You're just like your oppressor
And maybe that's why we fucked up now
And we livin lesser
Yes sir
