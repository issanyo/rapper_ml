[Chorus: Boots Riley]
There's a monsoon under my skin
There's a monster under my skin
There's a street brawl under my skin
Will you get under my skin?

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I take my martini dirty like three hop fiends who rentin' one telly
I want it shook like a man who just got shot in the belly
Make it smoky like his mama's voice screamin' for her baby
And on the rocks like Funkadelic in the 90s and 80s
I drink slowly and the sips sneak over my tongue
Like prisoners over gates before the dobermans come
I was born double-fisted but I'm holdin in one
And when I take a shot it burns like a smolderin' sun
And then its alcohol to vein, ethanol to brain
This moment is a get without the tinted cellophane
I don't need no soda mixer, just give me the cold elixer
Hustler's know that hunger is just murder's sexy older sister
Vocalist or orator, duck and clear the corridor
Some drink it neat like the jacket on a coroner
I go ape, my best friend is Dora the Explorador
That line was dope, I had to smuggle it through Florida
Arriba, abajo, al centro, al dentro
If they don't open up the gates, we all gon' go mental
Bottoms up until we all are free
And there'll be some for the homies and some for me

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
There's a monsoon under my skin
There's a monster under my skin
There's a street brawl under my skin
Will you get under my skin?

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I say hold up, hold up, hold up
Let me roll up, roll up, roll up
I don't drank no more
No Hennessy or no mo' Coca Cola
I don't pour no more
No purple drank and no more sippin' soda
No mo' double cup, no mo' fuckin' up
If she fuckin' up, I'm not fuckin' her
I can't fuck with her
She can't fuck with this, I don't fuck with that
Bitch I'm dope, I don't fuck with crack
'Bout the neighborhood, fuck the cul-de-sac
Cold as that, cold as Reverend Ike, call me Reverend Mike
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, intermission
Let me roll another one and we can get back on our mission
And the muthafuckin mission is be about your paper
Ain't no savior comin' up, [?] I just gotta ever save ya
Don't believe anybody ever tell ya opposite
Tell them hating muthafuckas they can chill or suck a dick
See we really chilly-willy but shit can get real savage
If-if-if that fuckboy vegan; fuck the beef I'll bust his cabbage
Ooh yeah, I'm macho man and on them
Bitch, I'm randy savage

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
There's a monsoon under my skin
There's a monster under my skin
There's a street brawl under my skin
Will you get under my skin?
