[Hook: Cory Mo]
My next move gotta be my best move
On the cool, I’m coming through make room
I’m getting to the money
So if you see me in the streets on my hustle game homie
Take note, cause I’m getting to the money
And I ain’t looking for no new friends
All I’m looking for is my ends
Pimpin’, I’m getting to the money
Nothing but them big face hundreds
What you trying to do I have done
Bitch, I’m getting to the money

[Verse 1: Cory Mo]
Never take it personal, pimping is all business
My mind on my grind, the women is off limits
Trying to make a dollar out of dimes and some pennies
I don’t want to hear about it if I don’t make a percentage
Money make the world go ‘round, it’s not a game
I been a lot of places, man I seen a lot of things
I smoked a lot of dro and poured a whole lot of drink
You say you never see me, that’s ‘cause I be at the bank
You got to have more than one hustle just to survive
Don’t do business with them if they don’t look you in the eyes
So-called friends could be enemies in disguise
Men lie, women lie, numbers never lie, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
When I hear you say that money is the root of all evil
I don’t believe you cause the profit gotta get to the people
Yo, fuck the ego
Best believe that we don’t need to be broke
It ain’t our job to be poor
Ain’t nothing wrong with wanting more
It’s so dangerous to think that coming up is a sin
That’s a design to keep you in conditions you living in
Based on they skin some people getting privileges and perks
They waiting on a trust fund so they don’t got to work
They say it’s easier, for a camel to get through the eye of a needle
Than the rich man to get into heaven, that apply to the greediest
You immediately hang yourself
Nothing will change until you start to make the change yourself
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
The money, the moolah, the guapa, the cheddar, the dough
They say your purpose worthless unless you getting more, so
I suggest you get off your behind and on the grizzind
They say that time is money so I can’t be giving tizzime
To any little honey trying to waste a nigga money
She say the pussy priceless and I say “ha ha, you funny”
But you ain’t gotta a car baby and you ain’t got a house
I guess the pussy priceless but you renting out the mouth
And you done let these lame niggas run a high tab
And you ain’t got no money to leave here or catch a cab
So baby I suggest
You price a little less
But I don’t buy no pussy, here’s a rack show some breasts
