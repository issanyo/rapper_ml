[Intro]
What's hapnin', sweetheart?
High as a muh fucker
I got some cool shit planned, baby, just pack ya bag
Just throw whatever. Really you'on even need to pack a bag
I'ma...I'ma take care of that when we get there
(High as a muh fucker)
Nah, we ain't goin' outta town
We just goin' downtown
And then I might...be goin' downtown

[Chorus]
I woke up this mornin'
I woke up this morning'
I got high as a motherfucker
High as a muh fucker
I awoke to this woman
I awoke to this woman
She was fine as a motherfucker
Fine as a muh fucker
And we woke, and we spoke, and we smoked
And got high as a muh fucker
And we woke, and we spoke, and we smoked
And then we Fucked like a muh fucker

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, hey baby
Last night was real crazy
The Compound was shut down
The A-town was so at it
Niggas screamin' at Alex
To get in, paid a stack
Up in the back with the twins it was cracked
Roll all my blunts fat
Like ya ass, like ya breast
Got damn, how many times I'ma look at ya breast?
I'm trippin', Jermaine Dupree only come to ya breast
And I caught Beyonc√© lookin' like, "That bitch fresh!
Who she is? Where she from? She a stripper I bet"
But to the contrary, yo man hustles and gets
Which enables you to whip around in that 'Vette
Which enable you to were such enormous baguettes
Which enrages them hater hoes and faggots
That wish they could trade places, them maggots
Ay, fifth of the trash
I got a fistful of ass
Reminiscing on this morning as the blunt gets passed I'm like

[Chorus]

Hey cutie, hey cutie
Let me rub on yo booty
You can call anyway, we gone chill, make a movie
We can clean out the closet
Talk about a few topics
I'm gone admire ya brain, you gone give me some knowledge
A hot pepper in bed, and so sweet in the sheets
We in the intercontinental rental suite for a week
Got Room 420 buzzin' like a bumbling bee
The size of ya ass and beauty just astonishing me
You a down ass chick, hey, what mo' could you be?
You say, "Michael, do it to me like you punishing me"
Not a player, but I crush it like I'm Punisher, see
Fuck you to sleep
And wake you up with weed and something to eat
Okay

[Chorus]

Sweet baby, sweet lady
Can you roll up a sweet
So we can reminisce on this, it's been a hell of a week
You are my Louie bag lady when we in the streets
And Fendi freak-a-leek when we between the sheets
I blow you shotguns baby in ya nose and cheeks
And later on, like blunt smoke, you'll be swallowing me
I be layin' in ya hair
Lookin' in ya stare
Facetime baby, if you need it, I'm there
Baby, I'll do it
Till it leak fluid
And I'm a Superman, I make that pussy go "Yuuuuueee"
Window to the wall
Bae we did it all
You even had a friend to come and walk around in draws
Wouldn't let me fuck her, told her "Nigga, hell nah"
Told me ya ain't trust her when we made it to the mall
5 bands, goddamn girl, what you bout?
Aww fuck it, hit the room, make love, get high, AY!

[Chorus]
