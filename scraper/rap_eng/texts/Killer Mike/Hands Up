[Intro: Daye Jack]
I'm feeling broken
Hopeless
No one to hold me
Love me
The world so controlling 
I'll show ya
People been dying 
Crying 

[Hook: Daye Jack]
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot

[Verse 1: Daye Jack]
I want to live forever angel here to hold my head up 
Don aggravated man in blue my death is on the schedule
Looking at a mirror skin is burning living in a kettle
Grew up in a melting pot black child going mental 
Brothers underground who's next feel the venom 
These snakes ain't tame moving independent (police) 
Without a leash, all my niggas falling by the several
Calling on a angel at the pearly gate saying hello

[Hook: Daye Jack]
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot

[Bridge: Daye Jack]
Hold on shooter
Don't forget your gun
Papa told ya you wouldn't die so young
No no no loser
Couldn't this win one
You not a soldier, boy you need to run

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Maybe, the kid that you refer to as a thug
Is just somebody else's baby
A baby, a ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
[?] why mom go crazy
When she see her baby laying facedown on the burning pavement, Amen
Can I get an Amen? (Amen) Get behind me Satan
That's some shit I heard my grandma say
But the devil working overtime and never take vacay
And you might have to let the devil know
That you will spray AK
In the neighbour, women, child, that community you stay
Move with the mind of Malcolm and your heart is MLK
Meaning nonviolence surely is the right and proper way
But if a devil do you harm, then that devil die today
Black Lives Matter, tired of boys dying, tired of moms and dads crying
Tired of being passed [?]
Tired of being in a private Palestine
Time ticking on tomorrow, we ain't got a lotta
I pray the prayers pardon Assata

[Bridge: Daye Jack]
I'm feeling wounded
Weeping
This body bruising
Hurting 
Thought I was chosen 
A new man
No one had told me
I'm falling

[Hook: Daye Jack]
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot
Living with my head down 
Hands up
No no don't shoot don't shoot
No no don't shoot
