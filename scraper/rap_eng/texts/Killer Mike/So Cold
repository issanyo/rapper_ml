[Intro: Cozmo]
Yeah
I'm feelin' this one Q
This a classic
Pachino Life

[Verse 1: Cozmo]
These rappers is so old
Need to retire rap
Fuck with young Coz, 'cause I'm where that fire at
Come walk through my home
Yeah, I'll take you inside of that
Inside my rap, still strugglin', but I know real cats admire that
I got a fam so most my time get applied to that
But I'm still hungry, see the fame, I desire that
I heard they sayin' I'm sweet now
'Cause I don't run around strapped, tuckin' that heat now
And I ain't in the mix, movin' P's and keys now
'Cause I could make a hunnit-thou, fuckin' with beats wild
You not in my ball game
You dudes is small change
Ice and a couple hoes, is that what you call fame
A lot of cats hatin' on me
But most of 'em fakin', homie
The world is debatin' on me
I got her patiently pacin' and waitin' on me
They know the flow is so butter
Rap with the soul level brother
I'm so gutter
It's no other

[Hook X2: Cozmo]
I'm so cold
So cold
So cold
Under pressure and won't fold
'Cause homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold
Got rap in a choke hold
And homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold

[Verse 2: Berner]
I won't fold
This street life is so cold
I'm holdin' my mom's hands
And beggin' her don't go
I'm watchin' my kids cry
The price on the brick's high
Shit, I remember when they were goin' for 10-5
And now it's like, losin' life is supposed to be easy
Now he lost his life over money
He was tryna' feed his child
And my young homie tried to send a brick or two
Be careful where you're shippin' to
It's been hard to get 'em through
But I'm in love with this lifestyle
This Kush is just so loud
I'm tryin' to slow down
My heart is just cold now
And trust me, them boys tried twice
But no, they couldn't touch me
Bag full of dirty money
Used to ride around town with that thing on my lap
And now I'm stuck in the traffic
And while I'm weighin' these packs
I start to think about all I used to dream about
Cars, big houses, and money
How can they leave me out

[Hook X2: Cozmo]
I'm so cold
So cold
So cold
Under pressure and won't fold
'Cause homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold
Got rap in a choke hold
And homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Conversin' with my O.G. and burnin' on some Christmas tree
Ask 'em why don't you please give me game on life mystery
Told me that we all born to die, so prepare to be
A maker of history and broken down misery
You told me every hustle that was ever born to struggle
Was forgivin by God, so I purchase the hard
Then I put it in the trunk
And I took a short trip
And I put it in the trap
And I make that brick flip
And it only took a Summer for my come up
Shorty had them units in the city doin' numbers
Fuckin' with the pretties of hoes, you remember
Tammy, Trenae, Melinda, Jacenta
Had all them hoes whippin' with a blender
Either that or carryin' them bags in the rental
And I done took my O.G.'s plug by December
They told that old man, homie, don't trip, remember

[Hook X2: Cozmo]
I'm so cold
So cold
So cold
Under pressure and won't fold
'Cause homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold
Got rap in a choke hold
And homie I'm
So cold
So cold
So cold
