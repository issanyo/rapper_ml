A rider til I go, so bury me a G, they don’t want it with me

[Verse 1: Dee-1]
I’m doing me and I don’t care what you gotta say
A modern day living legend, hope I don’t die today
I tried to stay sober for as long as I could but
The grind got me high, Yeah man that’s that good stuff
I’ve been around the country, every hood is a nightmare
But they be riding with me, when I need them they right there
The news be depressing when you hear about a life lost
A hundred dollars bought the gun, yeah that’s what his life cost
I smile when I look into the eyes of a young child
Life gets harder when you’re older, so have your fun now
And when it comes to rap, you ain’t crackin’ my top five
You sold a million records but you ain’t changed no lives
I give it to ‘em raw cause the streets they need that
I’m in my own zone, I don’t care about no feedback
Just label him a messenger, a warrior, somebody you should know
Exclusive with the flow, you can’t buy this in no store

[Hook: Dee-1]
A rider til I go
So bury me a G
I’m looking in the mirror
Like they don’t want it with me
Tomorrow ain’t promised
So get it right now
Another day on the job
I’m never clockin’ out
A rider til I go
So bury me a G
I’m looking in the mirror
Like they don’t want it with me
Tomorrow ain’t promised
So get it right now
Another day on the job
I’m never clockin’ out

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Trading war stories with my 12 Apostles
I ain’t Jesus but this here that ghetto gospel
And I’m my own worst enemy, that’s what I tell them
Dear Lord please rescue me from my rebellion
I cry for help but the world turn their back
They rarely there when you need them, I learned that
Made man tatted on my chest, I earned that
Was offered a contract for my soul, I burned that
This for the people who know murder is real
Just cause you live your life right, don’t mean you won’t get killed
Speak what I feel, do what I please, walk what I talk, mean what I say
Man look around me, I’m surrounded by Gs
The motivation is to try to succeed cause ain’t nobody at the top
Really riding for me, And I ain’t blind to the truth man I promise I see
That’s why I work for myself, ain’t no firing me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
"Aye, I’m the type to get the g’s, hah
Stand on the block, white tee and my soldier Ree’s, hah
Got the flooded piece, hah
Rolex, iced up barely touchin
Polo fleece, hah
Old school like Girbauds with the Ree’s hah
I used to hit the deck pumping Master P, hah
With my n*ggas, stomp fresh off the key, ha
Young n*gga froze face sniffin that “p”, hah
Uptown n*ggas live in violence
BG and Soulja Slim got the hood wildin’
As I’m bustin my ‘rello, jammin Mr Marcelo
Sippin on heavy lean, Cain Abel and Fiend
Play on the tv screens, and my car as they descend from the top of my Magnum roof with a fine b*tch & a friend
Laughing cuz they just landed in from New Orleans
Currently playing Curren$y, Dee-1 and DJ Gin"

[Hook]

They don’t want it with me
They don’t want it with me
They don’t want it with me
They don’t want it with me
