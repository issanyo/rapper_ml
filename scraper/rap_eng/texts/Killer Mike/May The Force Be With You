[Intro: XV]
May the force be with you
And everything you into
I-I-I said
May the force be with you
And everything you into

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I grew up on that D-I-R-T-Y S-O-U-T-H
Gone up in this Chevrolet listening to O-U-T-K
Meet me here today, I never thought that, no way
The nine's I was grinding, swervin' and serving more yay
My momma, she was wit' it, she said "rappers don't get no pay"
So when you get some money, fuck studio, get some more yay
Don't believe me? Ask Jeezy. Hit'em up and get at'em
And picked me up from studio, my momma laughed at him
In college, I hustled, trapped in front of your house
Then moved that dirt weed to them kids at Morehouse
From the study hall back to the dorm cause off in the dorm
I kept my word, word
I was tutting up bones, I was listening to Bone-Thugz
Sing that birds, burn
All the month with a blunt in my mouth as I cook the brick and Decatur
Goddamn I dropped the ash on my English Lit paper
I sky walk through these books but my mind just goes Darth Vader
I did whatever to get me some Yoda green paper

[Hook: XV](4x)
May the force you be with you
And everything you into
And everything you'll get through
Just make the force be with you

[Bridge: XV](4x)
So paddle on Young Padawan

[Verse 2: XV]
I grew up on that Deuce-One, Arlene, Don is what they call me
Chris and Larry my niggas and Jessica was my darling
Play the cut, peeled back, like sardines
They said "come out and play" like listening to Offspring
Mikey had this car mean, all clean, LX
Tilted like it's on lean, all springs and a head rest
I lost my nigga Maurice on the passenger side, niggas get jealous
"So watch out where you stay and play" is what my man would tell us
On the northern side looking for the ride he was whippin'
Half of the time them girls were trippin'
On the guy end he was grippin'
On the side I said "that's who I want to be like"
Been years since a nigga even seen Mike
I heard he heard my songs and said "that beat tight"
So many G's that past my block
So many think that's ballin' was they calling
Then they past the rock
I had dreams of an astronaut
And them haters be like Vader so I bounced from that hood
I'll see you later on the radar and I pray that you could

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Hey!
I grew up in that P-I double T-S-B-U-R-G-H
My city, my state, my place where my homies all of us stay
Playgrounds we chilled at, spots we got our meals at
Corner where we kicked it, start spittin' out all these ill raps
I'm still the same little goofy kid I always was
Way before I got a buzz and bitches started popping up
Think I don't show love you can suck up on my salty nuts
They taking shots at me like a hockey puck
I ain't turning Hollywood to be the man I have to be
Ex's popping up and they still mad at me
My mom still love me though, she watches Grey's Anatomy
I'm traveling dedicated, focused up on my masterpiece
Hey!
I'm on my way, my people think that I forgot 'em
Cause I don't got time to call 'em
It don't mean I think I'm ballin'
We be 'round the world coast to coast 'member where we from though
I know ya'll think I'm tripping but I'm always showing love oh
