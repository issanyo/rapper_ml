[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Hello from a Little Shop of Horrors
Ski mask like a Phantom of the Opera
Go cold like the land of Chicago
Child soldiers sprayin' the chopper
But you don't give a fuck, that's them though
'Til a peasant put a pistol in your window
You ain't really need that chain
You ain't really need that ring
You ain't really need them thangs
Snow on The Bluff showed up
With the slums in the city blown up
Now the white folks showed up
Everything bought sold up
Niggas assed out, niggas po'd up
Politicians so corrupt, sold our black ass out
Really ain't color, my brother
Here in Cabbagetown they put they white-ass out
Truth been told, I'm out

[Hook: Killer Mike & El-P]
He in here, me in here, we in here
Don't get captured
No cryin' here, just do your dirt and disappear
Don't get captured
Then lay it low, take it slow and reappear
Don't get captured
Return to us victorious, smoke pounds of kush
Don't get captured

[Verse 2: El-P]
Good day from the house of the haunted
Get a job, get a house, get a coffin
Don't stray from the path, remain where you at
That maximizes our profit
Is that blunt? Oh well, hell, so's this boot
We live to hear you say "please don't shoot"
A pure delight, c'mon, make my night
When I file reports what's right's what I write
Snuff films air all night 'till your last sane thought take flight
What a great sight, what a job, what a good life
The more we act wrong the more we are right
And who exactly gon' stop what we got?
We don't argue, we are not calm and impartial
Some call it work, but it's more like an art
We just paint the walls with your heart
And we better not catch you

[Hook: Killer Mike & El-P]
He in here, me in here, we in here
Don't get captured
No cryin' here, just do your dirt and disappear
Don't get captured
Then lay it low, take it slow and reappear
Don't get captured
Return to us victorious, smoke pounds of kush
Don't get captured

[Outro: Killer Mike & El-P]
Don't get captured
Don't get captured
Don't get captured
Don't get captured
Don't get captured
Don't get captured
