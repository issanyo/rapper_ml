[Hook [x8]: Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild]
Love and respect for my peers, mad

Keep sailing
Blind sighted lot seek cash
Cross your legs
Break your neck
It’s a big sun kids
Love is the answer
Put here to fight to live

[Hook [x8]: Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild]
Love and respect for my peers, mad

Steady drowning
Nerve shot do what I say
Watch your plate
Nation of stop and please
It’s a big ocean to kill
Love is a monster
Teach me how to rob and steal

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Peace God, there's no need for vexing
I self lord and master my section
360, providing my direction
I progress no matter the election
Extraordinary, something like a X-man
Something like Malcolm, Michael, X-clan
Feeling like I'm Garvey, man I'm talking X-men
Party, I'm currently locked in a tour van
Smoking on some head bang, listening to Saigon
Bamboo, X-clan, Brand Nu, Grand Pu
Ice Cube, PE, Dead Prez, Rp Jimmy
I'm poor but I'm righteous, teach me
Wise, intelligent, the devil is irrelevant
? of benevolent, elegant, elephant
Cruisin' through the ghetto, four doors on chrome
I salaam alaikum to the nation, I'm gone
