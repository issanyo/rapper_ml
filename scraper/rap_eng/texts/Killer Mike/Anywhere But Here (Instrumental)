[Featuring: Emily Panic]
I wanna be anywhere, anywhere but here
I wonder how long for this shit
Don't take me [?]
Moving through New York city in a black seven fifty
Like Batman moving through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes is a pass in a place
Where they found [?] and they shot him
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Time Square
But in the city that's gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor's a billionaire
You love Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narc
[?] Puttin' Sour Diesel in the Air
Trying to flip in my [?] couple, couple racks
And making the hell out of here!

[Chorus:]
[?] right from under you
There were too many clouds in the sky
[?] there were too many clouds in the sky
[?] calling out to me
I can hear her calling out!
[?] right from under you
There were too many clouds in the sky
[?] there were too many clouds in the sky
[?] calling out to me
I can hear her calling out!
Let the city kill away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear it calling out to me, out to me!
I'm a move in through the A-T-L in a black S-L
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the
But the [?] need pills like hell!
Even though it's black top from the layers to the top
Black blood still gets spilled
They pray that [?] no drugs were ever found [?]
Like the dream of the king when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of [?] motel
For now [?] these young black boys
See themselves sabotage their cell
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So the ex went happy to a dream [?]. while he kills himself

[Chorus:]
[?] right from under you
There were too many clouds in the sky
[?] there were too many clouds in the sky
[?] calling out to me
I can hear her calling out!
[?] right from under you
There were too many clouds in the sky
[?] there were too many clouds in the sky
[?] calling out to me
I can hear her calling out!
Anywhere but here!
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere but here!
