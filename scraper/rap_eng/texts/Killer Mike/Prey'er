[Introduction: Killer Mike]
Yeah
Talk that shit, Bam
Talk that shit homie
Talk that shit for black people, brown people, yellow people, beige people
Talk that shit for poor people
Talk that shit for the working class, man

You a true thug homie
We got your motherfucking back
You can say whatever you want to say about whatever you want to say
Tell the truth, and shame the motherfucking devil

[Verse 1: Bambu]
Bam!
The target of poverty by the white devil
Because I wasn't testing at my reading level
I was testing any of these busters
Yo, where you from?

Pare?! Lola’s like, “Bakit ka nag tatambay dun sa calle parate?!”

*

While kids were playing Autobots and Decepticons
We was really Megatron, we always turned to firearms
That's why when I die, like when we talked about in smart class
The hood gonna guarantee at least an R.I.P. hashtag

Post-Reagan, Bush and Clinton raps to get a third strike
Beat a neo-Nazi's stupid ass back to the Third Reich
Peel off in a dirt bike
Wheelies off the 101
The devil lies so you could drive your auto on petroleum

The devil bet on real estate to fail in '08
Invested every cent in water commodities so they fluctuate
Lucifer moving your school budget into policing
And telling all these polices "it's black and brown hunting season"

[Chorus]
Rally around a family with a pocket full of shells
Got a pocket full of stories that might land me in jail
And if you feel it turn me up and let me talk my shit
Well then let me talk my shit
Go ahead and talk that shit
Yeah imma talk that shit

Rally around a family with a pocket full of shells
Got a pocket full of stories that might land me in jail
And if you feel it turn me up and let me talk my shit
Well then let me talk my shit
Go ahead and talk that shit
Yeah imma talk that shit
Go ahead and talk that shit
Ooh Imma talk my shit
Come on and talk that shit
Yeah imma talk my shit

[Verse 2: Bambu]
The devil wasn't listed in a bible page
She was choking Eric Garner
Took that brothers life away

He put bullet holes inside of Trayvon
He shot Oscar Grant, right in his back, with his cuffs on
He shot Michael Brown and left him dying in the street
He beat Rodney King trying to get back on his feet
He took Sandra Bland and faked her suicide in the jail
He murdered Alton Sterling over DVD sales

He took Freddie Gray
Then he took Freddie Gray
He jumped out of his car and shot Tamir while he played
He murdered Earl Hayes
Shot Philando is a car
Same devil's in the desert stealing oil in the war

Same devil got you blinded so you front in your raps
That shit is wack, you're the "All Lives Matter" of rap

Yo shut the freeways down
I gives a fuck if you are stuck in traffic right now

[Outro: Killer Mike]
Hahaha
That's my motherfucking brother, man
We dont' give a fuck if you are stuck in traffic
You're gonna hear us, or you're gonna mother fucking fear us
But the system coming down if everybody don't get their fair share, mother fuckers
Talk that shit, Bam
Talk that shit on the behalf of the people
No color!
All these people my brothers, working class motherfucker
Villains - VLNS
Ya fucking bastards

Prey for the Devil!
