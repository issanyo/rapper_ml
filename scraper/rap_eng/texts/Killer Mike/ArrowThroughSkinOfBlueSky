Killer Mike:
[VERSE 1]
Ridin’, smokin', every window open
Thinking to myself can you outdo your magnum opus?
Otis Redding, playin’ in my Chevy
Coughin’ gettin’ higher cause often my heart is heavy
And my lungs smokin’ polluted like the air that’s in my city
Where a man can kill a child and the shooter gets the pity
Lord help me, I only write this shit cause I feel helpless
I hope before I die somebody felt me

[VERSE 2]
Feel me or not I don’t care, I survived a nightmare
I meditate take my mind to the trap I can see myself I’m right there
I can hear the angels talkin’, I can see the demons stalkin’
Find myself to remind myself to stay true from the womb to the coffin
Never cement to that fuck shit
Don’t come to crimes that you commit
Cause you run with the wolves and maneuver through the wild as a child, all innocence stolen
Lord have mercy my Jesus
Somebody help my people, seem only way we can make it today is to be bout the business of evil
