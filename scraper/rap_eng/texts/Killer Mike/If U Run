[Intro]
If you run

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Sit high as I ride on rhymes
Every line's like life on line, like life on line
So every time I sit, write rhymes
I write rhymes like life on line, cause my life on line
And since life's on line when I write these rhymes
It's no time for lyin', no time for lyin'
So allow me to humbly chime
That when I write rhymes I don't write, man I just rhyme
Cause the rhymes come out my mind
Defined by divine design
And now's my time, mostly talkin' to myself
When people think I'm out my mind, out my mind
Cause it's in my heart, there lives my art
Like Joan of Arc, I'll be a martyr, like they marked her
My only faulter, I didn't alter
When I leave I see a flyin' saucer
Before I sleep, read the works of Chaucer
Pretty young stripper girl, I up cost her
We make love, then sip on cough syrup
Shouts out to my wife and our mistress
Gifts you get when you are gifted
Bold and daring like Keith Haring
Crack is wack, now crack is back
Cause every time I flip a word
It's something like I'm flippin' on a bird
I got the whole hood rippin' a pack
And every fien with a rock and niggas flip, pocket got attacked
That'll send his ass to cardiac
And that is a fact, stuntin' like you Hollywood Africans
That walk around, don't know how to act
Don't know how to act
Jean Michel Basquiat, you are not
Just a bitin' nigga that went pop, that went pop
You just a bitin' nigga that went pop, that went pop
You ain't no Biggie or Pac

[Hook]
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble

[Verse 2: Webbz]
Passion of Christ with the passion of Pac
Surveillance on every ave, every block
Big brother, hoverin' above
Kids catchin' bodies, leavin' prints, no gloves
Cashin' in on every inmate
Tryna stay focused, I gotta keep my pen straight
Fuck a federal vacation at Penn State
We got no plane cause we get weight
Most blind to the signs of the times
Tryna elevate minds with the lines in my rhymes
Chuck D with a little Pusha T
Against all odds, nigga what it's gon' be?
I'm tryna see what Marshall saw
Pray it all happen 'fore martial law
One life to live and the time's steady tickin'
The people want more so the nine's steady lickin'
Educated street nigga, heavy kush roller
The government a virus like ebola

[Hook]
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble

[Verse 3: KXNG CROOKED]
This is what I put my heart in
Livin' life behind bars, no pardon
Go ahead and act hard then
I've been gettin' at 'em since Eve was in the garden
The flow about to hit you up
Split you up, the coroner will pick you up, bitch
I'm livin' like a pair of virgin twins
Attached to each other, I don't give two fucks
Nah, cause y'all wild as shit
You rappers sound like a pile of shit
Fucked the pile of shit, and then gave birth to a pile of shit
You pile of shit
But I'm the Chief Rocka that keep vodka
The heat cocker, rock a beat proper
The boy colder than a meat locker
The street chopper, it sound like a beat boxer
Enemies stay steppin'
When they meet a weapon, they gon' see their reverend
When they see the gates of Heaven, it's 187
Me and DJ EFN, we stay reppin'

[Hook]
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble
From the era where your pen game real
Givin' niggas that Scorsese feel
Welcome to the jungle
Titans of the game, you're small, remain humble
