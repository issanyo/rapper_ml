[Intro: El-P]
I'll flood the speakers with heat seekers
And keep sneakers cleaner than nunnery pussy evening of Easter
I'll leave a print on her keister, I suck the clit and release it
If it will please her I'll kneel to her
Best believe make a meal of her

[Verse 1: El-P]
Told the preacher I love her, he said that God was her lover
I said if he really loves her then he would want me to fuck her
I walk around in a bubble, a fucking scoundrel in trouble
In every town, make a rumble, the venue ground into rubble
Give me a ten, and I'll double, I'll split your face like some aces
I got a fragrance I'm wearing called, "I will shit on you basics."
The money wants me to have it, I have a hunger for data
I'm crunching numbers and crack unbreakable safes while I'm at it
I'm doing more than just rapping, you have to grant me that dap
When you around where I'm at just know that it is not where you at
I'm not on your map, I'm a mystery to you captains of industry
If the 'matic is missing me automatic, it's victory

[Hook: El-P & Killer Mike]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody live, throw the pistol and fist

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
We the grimy and gritty, made it the Grammy committees
Got told that we spit it too vicious and would never see victory
And I refuse to play humble as though my dick itty bitty
I got banana dick, your bitch go apeshit if she hit it
Meanwhile, you're too nervous, pervis
That's why you never get service
And me, I caught the preacher's wife workin' 'fore Sunday service
I put my hand up her skirt and then we prayed for a purpose
I baptized her in Jesus' name, left her shakin' and squirtin'
Ooh, I shocked the Sunday school and did that shit there on purpose
See, I'm a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose
Run the Jewels'll arrive at arenas, bunch of blood thirsty hyenas
To get revenge on the kingdoms
That killed the dreams of the dreamers
Drank alcohol for the demons, sip lean with all of the schemers
You see he groove with the people, move with the mind of a genius
You see, he workin' the angles so he ain't never an angel
They wanna get you to hang him, well give them fuckers a finger

[Hook: El-P & Killer Mike]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody live, throw the pistol and fist

[Verse 3: El-P]
Welcome to fuckyoupalooza, we bruisin' any who movin'
Who wanna stan' for these douches, you raise a hand and you lose it
I hold the door for old ladies, run into fires and save babies
I went to school in the eighties, taking the train with the crazies
New York, New York is the mothership where I used to smoke dust and shit
Now, I'm crop dustin' fuckers, suck it up and you'll love the shit
No more games, I'm above the shit, butter me up for nothing
I'm taking all of your ducats 'cause I can call when you're bluffing

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Who thought the son of Denise would be the leader of people?
When he was your house at Morehouse, slangin' pounds of the reefer
Sat with potential presidents and said the "P" should be legal as reparations
For what this nation has done to my people
I'm a pervert, a poet, I ain't a saint, and I know it
Been a crook and cooked the books but never shorted no whores
Promoters comp me the Moet, I'm the man and I know it
I'm the shit, bitch, tell me, how could I not show it?

[Hook: El-P & Killer Mike]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit, bitch
Everybody live, throw the pistol and fist
