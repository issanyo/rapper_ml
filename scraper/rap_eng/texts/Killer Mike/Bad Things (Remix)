[Chorus 1: Snoh Aalegra]
I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

[Chorus 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem?
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Something undefined is now taking over me
Who am I to fight me for my own soul?
I’m saying yes to things that usually are no for me
I kiss the neon night and let it have control

[Chorus 1: Snoh Aalegra]
I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]
Why do I feel so free when I’m killin’ me?
I’m fallin’ to the sky caught between all the lines

[Chorus 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem?
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

[Refrain: Snoh Aalegra]
I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I'm the most honest liar, give me a matchbook
I'll light a fire just to see the flame go higher
I bought a box of Swishers, burned a forest
I told my partners that I quit but man I'm still pourin'
I told my girl I'm chillin', shit, but man I'm still whorin'
My killer country lingo make these women treat me single
They mingle with amigo, head, yeah and it's on
And I ain't ever hit her, but yeah I got some dome, gone
To my next adventure, exts you was textin', but can't exit with you
I said I love you, girl please, I was messin' with you
The E must have had me Xin' with you
Molly and the marijuana had me flexin' on you
Cause baby I'm a liar, cheater, stealer, killer, wheeler, dealer
Who love sinnin' like the lord must love a righteous figure
I'll rob a church and a bank for a righteous figure
So bad that even Satan say, "I don't like this nigga"

[Chorus 1: Snoh Aalegra]
I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

[Refrain: Snoh Aalegra]
I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good
