[Verse 1: El-P]
Right for a right, wrong for a wrong
This is clearly not life's design
Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered
When you ask the universe why
Life is a journey, to live is to worry
To love is to lose your damn mind
But living's a blessing so I am not stressing
'Cause some of my friends ain't survived
Death's a release but a much bigger beast
Is a living on limited time
Like how do you look in the eyes of a friend
And not cry when you know that they're dying?
How do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that
Sometimes you had wished they were gone?
Not because you didn't love 'em
But just because you felt too weak to be strong
You couldn't bear to see someone
Who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak
The cruelty of randomness, hold it for ransom
That life will not fade in your dreams
You see that they're fighting and know that they're losing
But still you make jokes and you laugh
'Cause you know despite all the sadness
That you better get the good times while they last
Now every new word that they speak
You are already feeling like itâ€™s in the past
And when they are gone you just try to move on
Cause the memory's hurting too bad
Grown up so much and I wonder
Who you'd've become if you stuck for a while
Just know that I love you, good friend
Ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile

[Chorus: El-P, (Killer Mike)]
And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon (I'll see you soon)
But the truth is that I see you now (I see you now)
Still talk to you like you're around (like you're around)
And I guess I say you left too soon (you left to soon)
But the truth is that you never left (you never left)
'Cause I never let myself forget (myself forget, woo)

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth
Will leave us all mumbling and blind
So we stumble blind through depths of the dark
Looking for something divine
Life is a journey, to live is to suffer
And I have been suffering through mine
But living's a blessing, so I ain't no stressing
'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round
And he got no drama, but his baby mama
Is still on my line and she cryin'
I searched for the words to give her some comfort
For her soul and spirit and mind
I tell her that it'll be fine
But deep down I know that I'm lying
The family came, took rings and his chains
The bank took the house and the rides
The only thing left was his child
And she had his smile and his eyes
So much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her
She'd look at her sometime and cry
The very next day she cried
And day after day, she cried
Then called baby mama and told her
"I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried"
No killer was captured, but I know he listening
So, I'd like to tell you in song
The streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it
I hope that you righted your wrongs
I hope that you learn, I hope that you changed
So your mama won't know this pain
So my homie's name will mean something more
Than a nigga got killed for a chain

[Chorus: El-P, (Killer Mike)]
And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now (I see you now)
Still talk to you like you're around (like you're around) aye! (woo)
And I guess I say you left too soon (you left too soon)
But the truth is that you never left (you never left)
'Cause I never let myself forget (myself forget)
