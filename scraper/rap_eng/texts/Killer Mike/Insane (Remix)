[Refrain: Moon Holiday]
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

[Verse: Killer Mike]
This is a calamity, this is some insanity
This ain't what I make them records for, what I reckon for
Girl got a friend and I think we both be checkin' her
The way that we be starin', all our eyes be undressin' her
We should be finessin' her, we should be molestin' her
Instead of walkin' 'round all tense when I pressure her
My mama say it's sin and God won't be blessin' her
Everything about my molecular is secular
I be like: "It feel right", "Baby, you should feel this"
"I can't do this square life", "Baby, this the weirdest"
Sex, drugs, rap and roll, yes, that's my philosophy
Anything other than is livin' in hypocrisy
So if it feel good, baby, I'mma do it
Put that on the blood in my vein, no SuWoo
Did we do it? Yes
Was it fresh? Yes
We achieved higher through desires of the flesh

[Chorus: Moon Holiday]
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
