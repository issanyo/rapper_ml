[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
(They got me locked up in here)
(They got me locked up in here) And I'm sitting, doing hard time
Pissing in a metal bowl, eat shit from a lunch line
(They got me locked up) In here nobody knows you by your name
Youâ€™re just a number, living under bitch ass rules of a broken game
They put me here to die, left me angry and alone
For the crime of being old, they threw me in this nursing home
(They got me locked up in here) Rotting in my cell
(They got me) Fake plants and waterfalls, it's a living hell
(They got me locked up in here) So they can throw away they troubles
(They got me) All that I have now are my little German Hummels
Hummels, Hummels, Hummels

[Verse 2]
(They got me) Brand new bitch was just admitted next door
Hot piece of ass 'cause she's only 84
The next bingo night I pound that pussy black and blue
As long as I can get her before Tommy's grandpa do

[Verse 3]
(They got me) Man, I can't handle these old people activities
To a group on a bus, children come to sing to us
3 P.M. canasta, they put me up to pasture
Death row stops this, I think they call it hospice
Hospice, hospice, hospice

[Talking]
Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications
Bring 'em in
