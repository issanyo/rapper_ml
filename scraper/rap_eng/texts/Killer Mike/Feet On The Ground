[Intro]
It's only one way up, ain't it
We like it they love it

[Verse 1 - Sonnie Carson]
Born breach, feet on the ground out in the cold
Never worked retail, I don't know how to fold
Know where I'm trying to get but don't know how to go
Some respect and a good connect is like a pot of gold (RIGHT)
Straight outta Brooklyn currently trotting the globe
The game locked and we plotting unlocking the code
So I can shine like 40 seconds on 42nd Times Square
Times two hater get ya stockings exposed
I lock and I load when you driving a road-ster
You don't see the people on the side of the road, sir
No sir I don't see em and definitely wouldn't wanna be em
I'm on my way

[Hook - Sonnie Carson]
I got my feet on the ground, the world on my shoulders
Money on my mind and my head in the clouds
Chin to the sky, bullshit to the side
All I need is a full tank and I'mma ride 'til I die
What's up

[Verse 2 - Killer Mike]
Straight out Atlanta you monkey niggas bananas
Had better know my clips is filled to the tip and they bananas
Bananas like a Chiquita I'm rolling with senoritas
And both of em pussy eaters, we eating expensive dishes
Fulfilling expensive wishes my wishlist is extensive
My cars is European pee-ons you get peed on
Peed on ya Neon chain shine like neon
Sphinx on the charm of the chain like Leon
I'm looking at the ocean cause boats is what I be on
I could do this shit here forever I'm talking eons
Cool like my patna from school what's up to Cleon
I keep a sweet brown bad bitch butter pecan
She like to tell me she ain't black she Puerto Rican
And only like to play Frank Ocean and The Weeknd
I gave her good dick from the back and left her leaking
She told me "Poppy I'll be morena for the weekend"

[Hook - Sonnie Carson]

[Verse 3 -Sonnie Carson]
No days off, taking off is for runways
I get mail delivered on a Sunday
Millionaire thoughts, dough wishes
Flow switches, narcissist, non-smoker, no Swishers
Prototype Sonnie, no glitches
Married to the game, no misses, eat daily, no dishes
Dig that? No ditches, no friends equal no snitches
Which is the reason I stack bread like sand-whiches
Game recognize game, hoes do too
Bad one with me and she recognize you
Thousand dollar pair on stepping on through
What's up

[Hook - Sonnie Carson]
