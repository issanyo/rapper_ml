Give you what you want when you want it
(Cool and Dre, Killer Mike)
Give you what you need when you need it
(I think we got a poor people's anthem)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(It's what the streets need and want right now)
(I'm tellin' you, it's it, some substance baby)
Give you what you want when you want it
(I'm givin' it)
Give you what you need when you need it
(It's all for you, it's all for you)
Baby we're all gonna make it

We came up the hard way
The steal or starve way
Ski masks and get robbed way
Far from Broadway
Tragic but it's no play
And we livin' on the prayers our grandmother pray
Still remember Big Spank got slayed
Right on Allen Temple
My God poor people you're my heart and it that simple
And I'ma rap through the hurt until I meet dirt
And I'ma make 'em recognize your worth
Through the words of my work
To the children reared in the gutters
By single mothers
This might kill your big brother
Sayin' we ain't got much but we got each other
We got each other
Our roads rough, gettin' rougher
When times got tough we got tougher
We'll make it, just stay down for one another
Allow me to spill my heart and say I love you
Allow me to spill my heart and just say I love you
C'mon

(Ay girl I know it's hard)
Give you what you want when you want it
(Walkin' through the hood, one job(?), two children, groceries)
Give you what you need when you need it
(You goin' to work everyday tryin' to keep that car(?), tryin' to keep that apartment)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(I'm just here to let you know that I'm witchu sweetheart)
Give you what you want when you want it
(I'm witchu everyday Mom)
Give you what you need when you need it
(Just feel me)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(Somebody understands and feels you, you feel me?)

Sisters, I know it seems we're total fuck ups
But hold your head up
We're slippin', we fallin', but we gon' get up
And we gon' get this life together
I'll make you a wife and make it better
More than a song, an open love letter
To all the mothers
Who lost sons to a gun or life sentence
Wish I could give more than words in a sentence
This is your story
We are your sons
This is my plea for forgiveness
For our wrongs
For all the hurt we caused and prolonged
Times we was weak you stayed strong
And we repaid that by hustlin' crack
Out the back of your apartment
The narcs hit, put your face in the carpet
You accepted the risk, never turned snitch
And I still use the word "bitch"
Yo, I'm a dumbass, a dipshit
And through it all you claimed and acknowledged me
I hope this song can serve as my apology

Give you what you want when you want it
(I'm tellin' you I'm sorry)
Give you what you need when you need it
(This next one's for Niecy)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(This for you Ma, this for you)
(Look at you boy, top of the world)
Give you what you want when you want it
(Top of the world Mama)
Give you what you need when you need it
(And we ain't never goin' back down)
Baby we're all gonna make it

All I wanted was a hot pair of Air Force Ones
Sick of being picked on 'cause we was from the slums
Sick of seein' my old man shit on my mom
Sick of feelin' even worse when a new nigga come
Just wanted to make it better
Just wanted to make cheddar
Just wanted to make it so you could walk with you head up
Rap was hope
And I held it like a vendetta
Or even better, like a Beretta
Kept the rhyme pad tucked under coat and sweater
I kept 'em like prison letters
Stack neatly in a shoebox
On top, stolen Glock and fifty rocks
Despite the hustle
Rhymes was the means to a end
I was born to marry thought with a paper and pen
Wasn't born to be on paper or locked in a pen
I was born to bring honor to this brown skin
Mama I'm your son and your my best friend
Wipe your tears away, just hide it with a graceful grin
(Give you what you want when you want it)
I made good and you'll never have to hurt again
(Give you what you need when you need it)
I made good and you'll never have to hurt again
(Niecy's boy done good)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(Niecy's boy has done good)

Give you what you want when you want it
(I'll make you proud)
Give you what you need when you need it
(Your name will be spoken with honor baby, believe it)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(Niecy's boy done good)

Give you what you want when you want it
(You see it)
Give you what you need when you need it
(Respect and acknowledge it)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(I love you baby)

(It's for my people)
Give you what you want when you want it
(Bring honor to this skin baby, rise out of it)
Give you what you need when you need it
(Come out of the gutter)
Baby we're all gonna make it
(We are the diamonds in the rough)

It's all love
My man Mark, my man Rico
Glide(?), my man Tae, my man Zack
Slum Lordz 'til death
I love you
(It's all for you)
Niggas better know
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
Don't be hard, open your heart
Feel it, feel it
My man Terrence, my man Casko(?) behind bars
(It's all for you, it's all for you, it's all for you)
