[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Ain't nobody put a gun to your head and it made you listen
A lot of you, I'd rather be dead than to trade positions
You bitches will get to dissin', my bitches will get to drippin'
You bitches will get to fixin' dinner in pots I piss in
And I'm not a politician, indifferent to makin' fans
'Cause I'd rather shake an infant than trip over shakin' hands
Damn. and I'm makin' a stand like a witness and I'm makin' 'em mad
Hit list when I get into the lab
And I hit 'em with a punch and I hit 'em with a ji-ji-jab
Anybody wanna fight him, I'm Tyson before the flab
And they never gonna make it rain with them itty bitty lames can't hail a cab
My bitches thick, I'll put that ripple in they ass
While you tryna not to stare like when a cripple trippin' past ya
Anybody askin' for favors on they behalves
I'm debtin' you 'less it's revenue, then you can do the math
Huh, my boo is mad that I'm buzzin', she's scared I'm movin' on
A stubborn mothafucka, I stuck with her just to prove her wrong
Let that go, I don't really got to sweat 'em, I'mma dead that though
Alzheimers for hymens and that's why they so forgettable
Pitiful, better when I'm in the middle of a psycho episode
The good are dyin' young but I'm tryna live forever so...

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
My attitude is fuck you, askin' who the fuck is you
You fuckas wanna fuck with me, I promise I'mma fuck you
Fuck you, fuck this, what the fuck did this come to
Fuck the world and don't ask me for shit
So now my attitude is fuck you, askin' who the fuck is you
You fuckas wanna fuck with me, I promise I'mma fuck you
Fuck you, fuck this, what the fuck did this come to
Fuck the world and don't ask me for shit

[Verse Two: Killer Mike]
My attitude is that of a problem child in an after school
Probably this way 'cause I was forced to come after dudes
That was fully lame in the game and wasn't half as cool
As this fat fly flashy dude that's satin smooth
Satin smooth flow nigga, opposite of ho nigga
Better get about your grind, your cheese, your cheddar
Your hustle, your flow nigga
You say fuck me, no homo promo, I'll fuck your ho nigga
So 'bout mine, if you take mine, I'll show up with two more nigga
Tell you, I appreciate you taking that wicked, need some pro killers
Tell honey that she wasn't 'bout no money, she fuck with broke niggas
I would tell her fuck her but nah, I ain't a hope giver
I would tell you fuck you lame but I don't go nigga
Ain't no Eddie Long over here, I rap for dope nigga
Keep my shootin' on steady strong I got a scope nigga
For all you sucka duck ass niggas and hater crews
You say mothafuck me? Nah, mothafuck you nigga

[Hook]
