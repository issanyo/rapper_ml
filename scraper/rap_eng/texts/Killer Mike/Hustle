Yeah, Youngbloodz, Killer Mike, Track boys
Y'all ain't ready for this shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, we back and bumpin', Youngbloodz that's us for sho'
From left to right, we rockin' and kickin' down every door
Watch out now, get 'em shawty, oh, that's them, U-way boys
We set it off, don't get it, twist it, still out makin' noise
Big pistol, that's my word, ice cold is so superb

So bring your A-game, we bringin' hella pain
You disrespect my sip, I'll pop your back like pootytank
So if you're ready, run it, we got that shit that will

'Cause in the trunk it's bumpin', we goin' all night long
So grab a cup 'cause ain't no way in hell you goin' home

I'm a crime time hustler man, I tried to tell 'em my crew
'Cause it's the ex-convict, convicted felon
Banana clips bazmellons of all these stitches tellin'
The bitches of bazballers and secrets of Shot Callers
Of better rounds of scoppin', he said Lue a-Town to Oakland
Niggas prayin' and hopin', they don't get caught with dope and
Out a catin and a crippin' in Chicago, they folkin'
Down south we got 36 oles trapin' and focus
This is no hocus pocus, play the game like Locus
Playas vibe up and whittin', I'm the third Cosmosis
I won't get my crime around
I hustle baby
I stay down every time, no day

From the track or the trap for sand
I hustle baby
No day

My pimpin' is old school and they Chevy with bleak shoes
Tip tops and flip flops, Adidas and Suede Pumas
Who nigga for like y'all, they never goin' change that
They slang goin' where I hang and my bitches they whod-a-rest
And we all drink du-duces of that go for 5
We'll put that hot heat like between your eyes
And I keep it under the seat in the summer, they sweatin' me
Comin' down your street with beat sittin' on some chesly feet
Outta town in that's gold rims for shawty be servin' them
Everytime my Chevy stop, the rims they still spin
A-town for life ya'll we never goin' change that
Still roll with them dope boys on the bow with them J's at
