[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Myself at all times, I’m so allergic to phony
One of a kind, original, means I’m the one and only
God put me here to be humble and help my family survive
Sometimes I’m a victim of ignorance in my own pride
The devil be workin’ on me, I make it so easy for him
God be talkin’ to me, I light up the weed and ignore him
Money be on my mind, so much I hurt the ones I love
I move four hundred of stacks and rarely do it because of the love
My cocky conscious be like "you bigger than all that small talk"
That’s why my listeners be so rapped up in 8Ball's thoughts
I talk it just howI see it, the censored version never surface
Seem like the lack of love I get in the industry be on purpose
I brush my shoulders off and keep it unique whatever I speak
Somebody must like me cause every album I did leaked
Content harsh, my heart won’t let me talk it soft
You niggas is radio friendly, find something else to talk about

[Hook]
I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I’m from the land of the trill, Port Arthur Texas the city
Where broads be on the block boppin' and gully gangsters get gritty
From the 'jects on the west side where they throw up their sets
To the east where they put in work with no kinds of regrets
I’ve seen so many things, the average fool couldn’t handle
See brother killed brother, put out his lights like a candle
Seein’ gangsters turned into suckers in ten seconds flat
Because it ain’t just where you from, it's where the fuck are you at
But if there’s one that I’ve learned in all my time in this game
Is don’t let ho niggas and ho shit take you out of your lane
So from weak shit I refrain, and from weak dudes I’m averted
I’m the king of the trill so if you ain’t real I’m allergic
Bitch move around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
These boys ain’t official, they soft as a tissue
They claimin’ they men but they fuckin’ the bitch
They claimin’ they bang but they colors are changin'
They snitch to the cops to eliminate danger
These rappers is lame, these rappers are liars
How could you act all these fraudulent guys
Before I do that I will find me a job
Or find me a fake phony rapper to rob
It could be her, it could be him
If they’re a group then it could be them
But that wouldn't be me cause I’m opposite that
Opposite lame, opposite wack
Never a liar, I’m right and exact
Exactly right when I’m rippin’ the mic
The life I recite is exactly Mike
The life you recite is exactly hype
See first you was trippin' and rippin’ and crippin’
And now you’re bloodin', druggin' and thuggin'
Seeing you suckers is driving me crazy
False, you phony, you fake, fugazi
Pussy, you posers you’d better pray that I never catch you alone
Or I’m grabbin’ that tone and puttin’ that bullet
Right through your b-b-b-bone

[Hook]
