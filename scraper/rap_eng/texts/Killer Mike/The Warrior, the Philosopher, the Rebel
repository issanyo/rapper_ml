[Verse 1: Lil' Fame]
You already know what I'ma do
Push your hairline back more further than what Akon's barber do
Spit in your face like a llama do
And leave your grill smoking like a barbecue
I'll eat your food like Dahmer do
Be thy name who art in heaven like our father do
This is the marksman's chronicle
I call a jackass quicker than Obama do
My features bang like my LP shit
Just need a label that can sell these chips
No counterfeit Gucci, no LV shit
That boy Fame peep the truth, can't tell me shit
For the dinero I bring the heat like DeNiro
Across seas, niggas play me in Nero
Let it bang, let it bump
It's the marksman regime know what I mean
Throw it up, what's up

Fuck rap, hip hop put me on top
No question I send your ass back right to the essence
Dealing in my cypher I revolve around science
Then I react like a convict and start killing shit

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Lyrical ability has given me something to strive for
Via rhyming I'm providing for my children's needs
And enlightening industries within it be
It's really deep how a pen can potentially
Prepare you to fulfill your dreams
Are achievable there is no need to envy me
If you're a winner mentally you're capable of many things
I'm a man of integrity when you look at my legacy
You'll see consistency, skill and longetivity
I went from shooting to aiming for positivity
I kill a mic religiously, since a teen
I was dealing because fame was still a dream
Reality was it for me
I see so many die, I'm trying to live in peace
They be continually existing well physically
God MCs know I will give them Hell lyrically
I'm a nightmare to anyone who still asleep
Wake up and apologize, I been elite

Fuck rap, hip hop put me on top
No question I send your ass back right to the essence
Dealing in my cypher I revolve around science
Then I react like a convict and start killing shit

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
I'm on my bullshit game in the middle of the party
With a pretty young bitch and a bottle of Bacardi
And a lung full of smoke and a pocket full of molly
If a nigga try and try me I'm like good god almighty
I'm a pull out a piece, straight shoot through everybody
And the bullet quick whip kickflip into an ollie
Left 'em leaking on the ground and cleared out the party
Yeah I did the hammer time then I dip like Shine
No time to say sorry and deal me the pardon
Bang bang bang and I'm headed to the back door
Friends in the Benz so I'm sitting behind the 'lac though
Paid in the Escalade cause I got the sac ho
Might pull an [?] let's leave the sax ho
Freak did two chicks look like Satchmo
No homo promo I'm just trying to spit certain facts though
Money make a [?] change a [?] in the breeze
So a ho and every brother probably fucking with me
I got Melissa in Manhattan, Staten Island and these
Anita Applebum in Brooklyn and Quanda in Queens
Could be the other way around I'm so high on the weed
That I don't know if I'm in Santos or S.O.B.'s
And either way I'm getting faded in NYC
Like a Dominican barber got the clippers on me

Fuck rap, hip hop put me on top
No question I send your ass back right to the essence
Dealing in my cypher I revolve around science
Then I react like a convict and start killing shit
