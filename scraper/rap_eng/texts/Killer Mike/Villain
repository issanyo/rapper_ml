[Hook 1]
We don't love the heroes
We don't need the heroes
We will taunt the heroes
We don't want no heroes

We don't love the heroes
We don't need the heroes
We will taunt the heroes
We don't need your heroes
We don't love em'
We don't... love em'
Robbing, looting, shooting, villains
Robbing, looting, shooting, villains
Villains, villains, villains

[Verse 1]
Ain't no competition, when I'm on a mission
Go tell my opposition when I see him, I'm goin' kill em'
My other proposition that he end up in submission
I'm a god, I'm omnipotent
Really ain't got no feelings yet
He may beg for mercy as though he is immortal
But I am immortal, I come through different time portals
I might trip out and flip out, rip all his ribs out
Reckless and reckless, the villains I been 'bout
The women and children should get up and get out
The soldiers in there, should kneel to the God

[Hook 2]
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
I'm a villain
Villain (yeah)

[Verse 2]
If I meet a Superman, it's goin' be a super murder
I met Wonder Woman, but ya boy had to hurt her
It’s the Code of Hammurabi when the Joker’s in control
I'm a villain, god willing I'll destroy the heroes' soul
Superman's a slave to man and his master's a slave to God
They think they God, but they earn so I earn to burn they globe
It's my quest to take your best and defeat em' right in your streets
The heroes dead is what I said, now kneel at the villain's feet
