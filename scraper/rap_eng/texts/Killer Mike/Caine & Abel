[Intro]
You know I grew up with five sisters and no brothers
I'd be in Sunday school, and they tell us stories of Caine and Abel
You know the first murder that was committed by one brother to another brother, and uh
I looked around my neighborhood as a child and I saw the crime and violence and I said
"Wow...how could two people who love each other, bring this into the world?"
God bless em, you know?

[Verse:]
Two brothers, a single mother, a father that loved em
But not enough to leave the streets and make their mama a husband
The only males in their life was a couple of cousins
That their mama had babysitting ‘cause she was strugglin’
But typical ghetto shit, the cousins was hustlin’
Or should I say halfway, ‘cause they got high like their customers
The oldest boy was Caine and the youngest was Abel
Abel distracted cuz, Caine took 'caine off the table
They decided as pre-teens to serve the fiends
Like Pusha-T and Malice, they re-up'd for the green
Furnished their apartment like a palace, made their mama a queen
Abel was only 12, Caine barely 13
No idea of the evil that the streets would bring
Infatuated by images on the big screen
Like Nas in it was written, they had street dreams
By 17... they was on they grind
They were listening to old-school rap from mama’s time
Bought myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
Bought, bought myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
Is what Caine said, as Abel walked on his side
Into Candler Roads Pawn Shop
Caine bought himself an AR15 and his brother a Glock
Through the years they would spray it, they campaign on the block
Till every square foot of Zone 1 was locked
More money, more murder, marked their rise to the top
But like the Chambers brothers, like the Flenory boys
When you cut from the same cloth, made from the same stock
Sometimes you can’t share the same space at the top
These young brothers retired their young mother
Abel opened businesses in the name of his mother
Cain dropped off big money bags to his mother
And once a week they sat down for Sunday supper
She told em one Sunday how she loved em and she hugged em
Sensing something’s wrong, they asked her what’s your trouble
She answered: “Yall’ give me rings, riches, and way more
But there’s one thing that my heart truly prays for”
Caine smirked, said “Mama don’t say stop
Gave her 100K cash told her “Lady go shop”
Abel looked at his mother and the watering eyes
And told her "That’s nothin’ baby, I’m done flippin' the pies"
Caine looked at his brother with fury off in his eyes (WHAT?!)
Rocked him and he socked him in his left and right eye
And he hit him and he bit him and he split him in two
All he said as he beat him was “Why she love you?!”
The more mama yelled “Stop!”, the more hate he would take in
Abel was Roemello, Caine was Raynathan
Kris said "Love's gon get you" so we back to the Glock
In the middle of the struggle, all we heard was pop

Unlike Roemello, Abel was not able to survive that shot (God bless em)
Unlike Roemello, Abel was not able to survive that shot

[Outro]
I dedicate this song to Caine, and any brother who willingly, or unwillingly has killed his brother
Cause I know that scar on you forever homie...
It's the Grind, Grind time rap game, bang bang bang
