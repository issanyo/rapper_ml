[Pre-Hook: Tkay Maidza]
They say they’re coming for me
But I don’t want none 'cause I really don’t care and I’m still kinda young
Ruthless ready renegade they all want some this may be communism but I tell you this is mine

[Hook: Tkay Maidza]
Watch, what you've been thinking (I said it all)
Watch, what you've been thinking (Now carry on)
Watch, what you've been thinking (I said it all
Watch, what you've been thinking (Now carry on)

[Verse 1: Tkay Maidza]
All these people popping round
I swear I need an Adderall
But I won't let them witness
It's enclosed what I think
Teacher keep on questioning
And pointing out my novice
Now they jamming to my jingles like they're on a ice rink

Rocking jeans from Crossroads, and reading out the Cosmos
If they're looking like an issue, wipe them off the windshield
Nothing left to lose I'm stepping with the same attire
And I know you feel the heat because I'm nothing less than fire

[Pre-Hook: Tkay Maidza]
They say they’re coming for me
But I don’t want none 'cause I really don’t care and I’m still kinda young
Ruthless ready renegade they all want some this may be communism but I tell you this is mine

[Hook: Tkay Maidza]
What, what you've been thinking (I said it all
What, what you've been thinking (Now carry on)
What, what you've been thinking (I said it all)
What, what you've been thinking (Now carry on)

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib: Killer Mike]
Yo

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Hey Tkay baby they be hating your fresh
The more you rise they tell you comprise your best
I say fuck em I say get that bullshit off your chest
Don’t let a hater cause a bead of sweat on your breast
Baby keep it cool it’s the first day of school
Knowing you’re a rebel and about to break the rules
The old folks scared and they want you to be too
Handling you like a toddler. What they want you to be to?
Shit handling like pride tell them no bish no
The world is for the taking take all bish all
You the game oner I say ball baby ball
You the shit no toilet paper no stall
And baby I’m the butt naked truth no drawl
Anybody this SQUEAKY get the ooh and the uh
And that’s from your brother from another mother
Make sure you stunt hard and you shine on a SUCKMOTHER

[Pre-Hook: Tkay Maidza]
They say they’re coming for me
But i don’t want none cause i really don’t care and i’m still kinda young
Ruthless ready renegade they all want some this may be communism but i tell you this is mine

[Bridge: Tkay Maidza]
I set it off
Now carry on
I set it off
Now carry on
I set it off
Now carry on
I set it off
Now carry on

[Collision: Tkay Maidza]
Still kinda young—I'm still kinda young
Still—still—still—still kinda young
Still kinda young—I'm still kinda young
Still—still—still—still kinda young

[Verse 3: Tkay Maidza]
High like the Himalayas I'll keep it and they be nothing
Tryna get on this scale
But they tripping
Slipping and puffing
Killing the mic with Killer Mike
Busy, and moving moving
The circle is smaller, smaller
But focus
Made me a nuisance. Witness, witness
Got no business
I don't hinder, why you vicious?
Minutes minutes
I don’t have, you not really fitted
Then forget it
Carry on, you’ll never find me, if you get in there
You see, that I don’t care
Cause I’m too young
To be prepared

[Pre-Hook: Tkay Maidza]
They say they’re coming for you
But i don’t want none cause i really don’t care and i’m still kinda young
Ruthless ready renegade they all want some this may be communism but i tell you this is mine

[Hook: Tkay Maidza]
Watch what you've been thinking (I said it all)
Watch what you've been thinking (Now carry on)
Watch what you've been thinking (I said it all)
Watch what you've been thinking (Now carry on)
