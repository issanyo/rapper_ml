[Verse 1: B. Rossi]
She done put her reparations in a handbag
He done spent his reparations on his swag, swag
A black nigga, put your fortunes in a sandbag
Laugh at your misfortune then we put it in a hashtag
Ain't no leaders only leisure, only reapers, ain't no sowers
They get higher, we get lower, damn it's over
If racism ain't in color then it's damn sure in the class
Got the races on each other, you got niggas then there's blacks
You got crackers then there's whites, separated by the green
After five hundred years, think we play for the same team
Smokescreen, make the president the black guy
It ain't no reason why you shouldn't have success, right?

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Anybody interrupt freedom, kill 'em
Word to Robert F. Williams, feel 'em
Devil got me sick to my stomach, boo
Word to Elijah Muhammad, ooh
I don't give a damn what the preacher ever tell y'all
Jesus, Muhammad, ain't comin', woo
I'mma tell y'all what the ancestors shoulda done did when they seen the first boat comin, yeah
Killed every man, child, woman, yeah
Killed every damn thing on it, yeah
Killed everything if it looked European
Send it back to the Queen like, ho
You ever step your foot in Kemet, bitch we slit your throat
We send them funny fuck boy preacher types back to the Pope
Fuck is you? Fuck your Zeus or fuck Medusa
This the school of Shaka Zulu
Fast forward to the future, choppa do you
We done dyin' and they cryin' and we screamin' hallelujah
When them crackas ask why say we did it for Lumumba, fucker

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Load up my clip off a Zimmerman
Filling my pocket with Benjamins
Who the fuck are you? I been a man
Them crackers see me "oh not him again"
Take your ass out the trap middle finger to Trump
Fuck the police, they crooked as they come
They pull you over and know you legit
Ask you for your license, when you reach then they dump
Now the prison yard like the cotton field
House nigga's snitchin', that's what got 'em killed
Nigga thought he made it cause he got a deal
First album suppo' been outta here
Not quite dude, back to selling blow
On some 24s I'mma send it here, learn to stay silent
Learn more on these streets then they did in they college
I'm certified, don't murder guys
But my niggas still far from civilized
Kill for anything but civil rights be the murder case
Cause a nigga like, they heard it from the king, from the king
What you mean, bitch?
Trade my forty acres from my mule and my necklace, yeah

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule
