[Verse Killer Mike]
Dope money, bitches cars
Take two of these baby you gonna see mars
Smoke one of these you won't wake up until tomorrow
Medical baby only comes in a jar
Girl let me chill while you pop that pill
Your girl [d.??] [treat her nose???]
Like my chi' town niggas say damn she cold
Show me she the one like her name D. Rose
I like super hoes that ain't super scared
Fat black rap mack on super head
[I don't waste the shit I super say it???]
And I'm make that bitch break super bread
Cause I'm a pimp y'all
And not a simp yall
And that's why I stay on chill
My bags cost eight-hundred an ounce, bitch pay my medical bill
Gone...

[Hook ? + Killer Mike]

[Verse Thurz]
Fifty-one fifty, fifty-nine fifty with the fitted on tilt
[Love married to a short???] [?] [get killed??]
[Know this??] murder state of mind
Hunted bodies; no guilt
Need a hundred tear drops, my shoes is murderous
Hundred bitches need mops stimulate their minds they serving us
Seeing white girls [sniff out of raw???]
[Then they cuffing they balls they call???]
Cause I'm high fashion dick I'm casting
They acting like my dick belong in they drawers
And I let them do it
Puffing O.G., kush sativa
[Haul?] a Cuban, [coheba(sp?)?]

[Hook ? + Killer Mike]

[Verse Aleon Craft]
Farmers market [shout it/ shorti?]
Strawberry lemon, pineapples & mangos
They just want to party, time equals money
We ain't fucking with them lame hoes
Sratch that...
Etchesketch
[Maybe ya'll add her??]
You know I keep my swagger vacuum sealed extra fresh
Girl fix her health that's all a mess
Coke residue all on your dress
Trying to tap out but she let me tap out then
Shorty tapped out that's all I guess
Damn, she bad
Harvard grad
Brain like a valedictorian
L.A. to Mars; I'm back to the future
Feeling like I'm driving a DeLorean
1964 Old school Chevy historian
On datons, yup I said datons
Niggas ain't cool enough to walk to my Candace
Why these hoes wanna try my patience
I hope my doctor can see more patients
I need that good, good good good Megan
Stupid ass number nigga I'm just saying

[Hook]
