[Killer Mike]
Peace will never tame the hatred in me
I'm too restricted
Separated from your society
I'm a new breed of species
A curse to lips that speaks my name
I'm different
Twisted
My mind is not the same
For those who deny the truth
But seek to try and find it
You, my friend, are blind to the truth
For you are simple minded
My ways are called abnormal
They treat me as if forsaken
But all shall fear the wrath
Just like when my heart was taken
And if these words fail to reach the ears of the limited few
You won't know
But when I strike, you'll wish that you would have knew
This beast is on the loose
If you treasure life then destroy it
Word is too realistic
For you to simply ignore it

I've given a fair warning, and I've been well because I'm cutting loose
A new terror walks the earth
And now its all up to you
If all hope should fair
Then you should sit and ponder
Your fate has been decided
By one dangerous monster
