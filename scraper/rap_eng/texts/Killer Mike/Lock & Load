[Verse 1: MNDR]
Boys and girls in the front get your guns out
Got heart, got style, got a lot of mouth
Do ya, do ya?
Do ya, do ya?
Itâ€™s full now, Perplex what they talk about
Bust another shot, show me whatcha talkin' 'bout
Do ya, do ya?
Do ya, do ya?
Do ya?

[Pre-Chorus: MNDR]
Lock & load, fire
Lock & load, fire
Lock & load, fire
Lock & load, fire

[Chorus: MNDR]
Oh, stand your ground
Wait for it now, standin' your ground
Oh, stand your ground
When bombs rain down, they're comin' for you
Fire, fire (comin' for you)
Fire, fire (comin' for you)
Fire, fire (comin' for you)
Fire, fire (comin' for you)

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Shit's fucked up said the cards of the tarot
They  ain't know my DNA match with the pharaoh
I exact revenge at the end of a barrel
Eyes on the prize, it's the young black sparrow
Ey, I cannot be stifled, grippin' on the rifle
Team movin' through the concrete jungle like we tribal
Cause life's a vicious cycle, as toddlers, played with Tyco
Now we robbers goin' psycho and shootin' at our rivals
Black suit like the minister, Marvin with the carbon
Yeah, sucker came to finish ya, AR handler
AK manager, make 'em shoot and harm 'em
And now who the fuck gon' handle 'em?
Principle and pistols on these pussies in Atlanta bro
Please man when I pull it in I pray the bullet damage ya
I'm a bad black bastard
Til I'm in a casket, a bully with a fully in a Buick on some baskets
Gymnastics how the bullets got these bitches doin' backflips

[Chorus]
