I’m from a place where real is real
(Okay, we about to be out of here)
I’m just tryna breathe
(Talib Kweli, Killer Mike)
I’m from a place hustler’s still
(Beautiful struggle continues)
Rob and steal and kill
And extort and
I’m from a place where real is real
I’m just tryna breathe
I’m from a place hustler’s still
Rob and steal and kill
And extort and
(Yo it’s so dangerous man, let’s go)

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Baby’s locked in cages
Mamas look twice they ages
Starvation’s too much to stomach
This must be Reaganomics
These ain’t for Martin Luther
Don’t let that name dupe ya
And how he’s born violent
He’s on that younger future
On my block, boys with they hair
Walk like two miles, sell crack rock
And sell some samilia
It sound familiar?
Mi hombre, this is our familia
Addicted felons, gun stealers
And dope dealers
And I’m from where coke is captain
And you can buy whole in the back
Of your block, in a napkin
By themselves, children are left to fend
So we indulge in sin
Do what it takes to win
Push off, shoot that jump
But please check yourself, we win
(I’m official
Your Georgia homeboy
Killer kill
Putting it down for the ghetto)

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Ride with cracked up bumpers
Do what it takes to win
We mix our juice with Gin
We mix our fight with hands
We burn our dro slow
Only with our closest friends
We never scared
We ride and die for one another
This ain’t my boy
This boy here, he’s my brother
For him my blood’ll spill
For him I will kill
This is true, my testimony live from Dixie Hills
This is Killa Kill, live I rest from Adamsville

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Before he toured school, my father was an entertainer
Traveling through the south with a band of the crackers love to hang ya
He stayed with me while I know most niggas pots is strangers
Got soo gangsta, godfather to my cousin in van
My suns is daily green
These is the roots of my family tree
My path is locked, I'll hand you the key
I ran through the streets, niggas can't advantage of me
I've seen calamities, soo much insanity, oh the humanity
From a place where niggas keep the game face of the grills
And go to the steel to make it real just to pay off some bills
While robbing and killing is just basic skills
But still niggas documented on those tapes of film
Bullets gon' hit you in your stomach, near where your spleen be
And rip you open, split six pack in half the mean three
Yeah put addicts in the order, manics, yeah the hood have it
You know the hood pack it, leave you in the wood jagged
I wish you would actin', Brooklyn don't act a fool
When apex tack only way to pack a tool
I got the flappers, you know the swagger with attitude
Nigga piss in my ear, I let 'em go like ladders do
Oh you wanna battle dude? You my challenger? I'm bad for you
Make a snappy dude become a grown ass man, dawg, this shit I have to do, bad for you
When I spatter you back up a few feet away
When niggas laugh at you, you feel like there's something you need to say?
