[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
So I just heard I gotta claim this shit
Thought what's understood ain't gotta be said
Ya'll done slept on a nigga too fuckin' long
Now it time to pull the covers out the mufuckin' bed
People talkin' cosign I don't need a cosign
I been doin' fine I been killin' this shit
If you ain't a con, I'ma groupie the tongue of a dime
I'ma ask you get off my dick
Took the high road coulda called niggas out
But I ain't that type though
Nigga need a typo, jackboys out
But I'm good in the hood round here
Lil' nigga will need lipo skinny
Two pints still in my Henny, 9th in the bottom of the inning
Odds been stacked up against a young black man, fuck that nigga I'm winnin'
I be on they heel like Achilles, some of these niggas so silly
Yeen fuck wit me, now I'm shinin' and all ya'll sayin' ya'll down like really
These boys Milli Vanilli, talkin' ain't really sayin' nun
Hope my heart don't get chilly, cause I've been tryna keep in the oven

[Chorus: Trouble]
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most times I just stay alone
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, most times I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most times I just stay alone

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
I been fightin' stress off tryna keep faith
Niggas in my ear I can tell they gettin' nervous
Shit I'm like chill out, boy I'm gettin' close
We won't be surprised if a nigga pull a mill out, sign me
Fuck that I'ma need double, ya'll mufuckas in trouble
Nigga been grind, now Big Boi state, Fred Flinstone nigga burnin' rubber
Asked Burn One man I scraped up change just to get Summer Dreams out to 'em
Tatted that shit on my arm, really meant a lot, was the first one to pop
You done thought ya boy wasn't no harm
And frankly that was my plan
Watch the humble guy wit da Kool-Aid smile
Hit da scene like yeah I'm the man
See I, notice, niggas, only, hate you, when your, loud
I be, cool, timber low, in my zone, blowin' loud
They were, sleepin', on me, hard, they were, snorin', pretty, loud
In my, city, we some, kings, yeah da, A, on my, crown yeah

[Chorus: Trouble]
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most times I just stay alone
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, most times I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most times I just stay alone

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & Scotty ATL]
These lame ass niggas ain't shit, these weak ass hoes ain't worth
When I was dick in the dirt nigga screamin' for help, ain't nobody heard
But now I'm fire hot talk grits in the pot like coke when its not off serve
Same pussy nigga wouldn't take a nigga call, callin' my phone talkin' bout earn
I'm talkin' bout same lame nigga when he heard my ticket told me patna I ain't think he was worth it
Now the same lame nigga tryna call me and offer me double what he offer for my verses
Pussy ass nigga better know its a new day I charge quadruple for my service
Cuz, wasn't tryna offer up boss up won't even purchase here my wife new purses
Man I ball like Dominique and I smoke gas in my sweet
Brought a bad bitch to my suite and I fucked that hoe to sleep
Hol' up Kill, yeen gotta explain, man fuck that, mind stressed out, blowin' hell on
Lost a lot of friends over bullshit, niggas ain't loyal that's why I gotta pray alone

[Chorus: Trouble]
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most times I just stay alone
I don't believe in what you do so I just pray alone, I just pray alone, most times I just pray alone
And I don't trust too many niggas so I stay alone, I just stay alone, most time I just stay alone
