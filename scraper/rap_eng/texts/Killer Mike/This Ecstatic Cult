[Verse 1: Lushlife]
The post-rainy day gentleman crook
The fast-talking, city-slicking, hit your betty with looks
I’m better with books and steady rocking elephant hoofs
Rolling uptown the sound, kid, irrelevant hooks
So, when you peep the flow, son
Better watch where you stand
The first five rows is cosmos alive in the jam
Man, I’m sitting on a chrome horse developing plans
To keep sands in time, still impressing the fans
Blessing the lands, of milk and honey, dap for my fam
I want the cityscape, a pretty face, on top of a grand
She’s a sewer rat
Dreams of sunlight that blew her back
Fewer cats that I know in the game be doing that
Maybe I’ll see a Phantom Tollbooth or never be back
Maybe I’ll buy a golden goose, son, I’m praying for that
Paying for that, so much I can’t say it in raps
But I’mma keep on blazing hits ‘til the sheep will come back
And people come back to see me when I’m faded away
Fuck that, I hope I’m still here later today

[Hook]
We ought to be together
We ought to be together
We ought to be together
We ought to be together

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Hey, must I remind niggas all on they grind
That one time they trying to hit you with some serious time
And they ain’t even gotta show you with a nickel or dime
When some nigga you been knowing
Went and dropped the whole dime
Just to lessen his time
Man, how could you trust a nigga, call his homeboys lying
And I’m the opposite off that bullshit, pull quick
Back on that Adamsville Killer bullshit
Fucking right I get hostile
I’m trying to get it like a Rothschild and live ‘Pac wild
Fuck a bloodsucker, house nigga, nutsucker
I never loved ‘em and I fucked that nigga baby mother
Motherfucker, you ain’t never shit, and never was a
Probably kinda nigga that’d snitch on Harriet Tubman
So keep your business to yourself, and keep it undercover
One time, I’ll holler brothers

[Hook]
We ought to be together
We ought to be together
We ought to be together
We ought to be together
