[Intro: Sizzla]
Oh ah oh ah yay! Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh, yeah ay yeah ay!

[Verse 1: Sizzla] + (Scratch sample from Bone Crusher)
They can't keep a good man down always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds, they will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officers askin for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw first
Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
(I ain't never scared)
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
(I ain't never scared)
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
(I ain't never scared)
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
(I ain't never scared)

[Chorus: Bone Crusher]
So I'm outside of da club and you think I'm a puuuuuuuunk
So I go to my loaded tech 9 that's off in the truuuuuuuunk
I told that muthafucka
I ain't never scared (eastside!)
I ain't never scared (westside!)
I ain't never scared (southside!)
I ain't never scared (northside!)
I ain't never scared (southside!)
I ain't never scared (eastside!)
I ain't never scared (westside!)

[Verse 2: Bone Crusher]
Let a choppa go PLOOOOOOWWW! to yo melon
Now the plasma is oozin outta yo cerebellum
AttenCHUNNNNN! Fuck nigga, now you swellin'
You ain't talkin hardcore, now is ya? Lil' bitch!
Got'em runnin scared of a... BIGGA NIGGA!
Cuz I put the heat to his ummm... HILFIGER!
Now on dat drank and on some of dat dank
My pistols gettin' thirsty now it needs anotha drank

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
I got a hot 4 fever, call it bitch Benita
Knock the apple off any bum or the hollow heat seaker
Redcross bitch niggas, fuck the pint, she take blood by the liter
I'll never leave her, my viscous vixen
On liquor, send dat ass to God quicker
No matter yo religion, you Muslim, Hebrew or Christian
She indiscriminate with punishment, she send'em missin'
My gun's my favorite bitch and
And she got permanent PMS so she stay bitchin!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: T.I]
Noooooo, I ain't bad, just don't kiss no ass or take shit
And I'm a grown man, find you somebody to play with
If you'on like me when you see me, betta not say shit
I'll choke yo ass out like Dre did that bitch
You betta tell these pussies they ain't fuckin wit no rookie
I'm a Bankhead nigga, I'll take yo cookiez!
So don't make it a me or you situation
I'll have yo partner down at I.C.U. visitation
Like, hope for the best, but I'on think he gon make it
Not the way he was shiverin and shakin on the pavement
I'll tell you wha, if you make it, call'em grace cuz he amazin
Find out these verses wasn't the only thang blazin and
Just when you thought that I was done I was savin the
Best for last, nigga kiss my ass
Like Della Reese, they my folkz, itz best you just let'em be
Cuz I do the shit precincts and them FED's just ain't never see nigga!

[Chorus]
