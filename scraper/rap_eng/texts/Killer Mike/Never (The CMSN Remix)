[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
Never chase girls, chase dreams first
Motion picture drive, I concluded that my Dreamworks
So I pace right, never see my brake lights
Never trust a person but fam, too many great whites
Never work without merit, never live but don’t cherish, cause we only born to perish
This is a luxury, tariff
Here to preach a brand new Sermon, Erick
And it’s hysteric
They say you too pretentious, don’t get into that
Never the same, I went left like a Democrat
I would like to present you with this rap award
And I got more gigs than a Apple store
Ayo, you wildin’ boy, you ain’t even stylin' boy
It’s like I’m On A Boat, feeling Lonely on this Island boy
My life will never be the same
If never ever was, you’ll probably feel my pain

[Hook]
This is forever, this beat is on black pepper
You could get shook if you lookin’ a little extra
Never fall off, just make it a little better
And when they think it's sunny, that’s when we change up the weather
And when you say you better, I bet I’ll say never
And if you say you better, I bet I’ll say never
And when you say you better, I bet I’ll say never
And if you say you better, I bet I’ll say never

[Verse 2: XV]
I want this thing forever, I never will give it up
The game was in the sink and I promised I'll lift it up
When shit was dying down, my momma said live it up
Until I find a crown with more diamonds then pimping cups
I elevated everything
Swore to be the brightest square in the circle like a Tiffany wedding ring
Anyone or all, leave to laundry day
And I ain't no Kid, but I'm calling Plays
All I say is never give your stars away
The night try to kill sunshine like Marvin Gaye's dad
I watch the days pass like Romo
And stop fucking around with they ass, no homo
Keep that on the low though
You know how they acting
Girls treat me like Frodo
Always saying I'm Baggin
Ask where my ass is
I am Where The Wild Things Are
Even mom didn't know where the Max is

[Hook]
This is forever, this beat is on black pepper
You could get shook if you lookin’ a little extra
Never fall off, just make it a little better
And when they think it's sunny, that’s when we change up the weather
And when you say you better, I bet I say never
And if you say you better, I bet I say never
And when you say you better, I bet I say never
And if you say you better, I bet I say never

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Fifth riding heavy my gun is Chevy forever ready (speak)
I gotta make sure my momma don't live to see me buried (preach)
Atlanta made me prepared to live never scared
The block is hot as an oven and me, I'm chef and bread
The name ain't gotta have a rapper give me street clout
Cause I was there with them niggas don't rapping niggas rap about
It's Mr. Never Scared
It's Mr. Never Snitch
It's Mr. Zone Four, never punk, never bitch
It's Mr. I Ain't Never Heard Of You Niggas
The sheer sight of you I might murder you niggas
It's never beef cause I might burger you niggas
I will creep off in your home and I will burgle you nigga
Real sharp knife, real surgical nigga
West side Atlanta we ain't merciful nigga
I refuse posse, we don't back down never
Adamville, Flatland and that's forever
Bitches

[Hook]
This is forever, this beat is on black pepper
You could get shook if you lookin’ a little extra
Never fall off, just make it a little better
And when they think it's sunny, that’s when we change up the weather
And when you say you better, I bet I say never
And if you say you better, I bet I say never
And when you say you better, I bet I say never
And if you say you better, I bet I say never
