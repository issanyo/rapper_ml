[DJ Clue]
New Outkast
For my dirty South Niggas

[Outkast]
Out of the basement
Out of the dungeon
Look at Georgia boys
What have you done to them?
Rippin and sippin
Pimpin' and clippin'
And trimmin' up all the women
I'm swimming
But it's odd to me your words are kind of drippin'
I'm trippin'
Your flow's non-existant bitches missin'
Like Eric Robert Rudolf
Or Puss in boots with his boots off
Howdy doo boss
Check the southern slang boy I got a true drawl
From East Pointe to New York
It's OutKast and clue y'all
Howdy doo, y'all (Howdy doo, y'all)

Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better

Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better

Pissin' in the wind
Or shootin in the dark
Out on a blind date
Maybe fucking in the park
Without a rubber on
We are not alone
When I was younger songs
Had more fucking meaning (Meaning)
Now we are fiendin' for the new-new doo-doo
Stankonians activate that part of you that don't mo-ove
You think you're gettin' closer but you don't have a clue
Who only plays nines's and tens on the 1 and 2's

Hook (x4)
We can do it too
Funkanella, funkanella

[Killer Mike]
Allow me to remove your crew of those Iceburg sweaters
Boy I've never seen soft punch a fella
I remain in, the company of insane men
I be the reason niggas in the jeep's will tuck they chains in
Keep it swingin'
Why you trippin'
Hey we brothers
I'm like why you sniffin'
I got a snort habit motherfuckers!!
Niggas up the ante
But all your high yella heffa, got you up her panties
Leave bitch niggas naked like D'angelo
Crying and close to dying on they grandma's flo'
If you tell us where the dope at then I promise we go
Stop crying, stop praying where the yeh at ho'
Don't you dare scream Jesus I can snuff your mouth
Money, dope, you let these D boys move out your house
From Red Oak to Red Hook, I'm theme music for crooks
Michael from Adamsville with a murderous look
Leave you shook and nigga Punchenella, punchenella
I urge to Rob, rob-a-Fella, rob-a-fella

*Break {Speaking}*

Ayo rob that fellow man
And give me his god damn jewelry nigga
Hell yeah nigga
Strip down, strip buck naked for a nigga
Get that for it nigga
Strip nigga

Black on pop nigga
{gunshots}
Man fuck that nigga

[Slimm Calhoun]
Now Slimm ain't havin' it
A DF advocate
Bustin' with Kast and Clue
Now Calhoun with a 'matic means
Shit can get tragic, mu'fucka
So what you gon' do
It's the deal pushing flash pan
The big deal change
I'm working up
Two in the back
Tocked out in the main
Keep this thing blowin' for the heathers and the hatas
Just got off the caper for the case in Decatur
Now I stacked up and sacked up in the back to the block
With eight bars to the heart
To asert it I chop
Keep working with 24 in the Glock
Major deep game, aquamini and Roc
