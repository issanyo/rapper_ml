[Hook: Janelle Monae, (Sleepy Brown)]
We spend summer dreaming
When we coulda be leaving
(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)
(See you when the sun come up)
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)
(See you when the sun come up)
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
The moon is now my sun, and my nights are now my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean: I'm in between sunset and sunrise
As "it's on" type of nigga, for the home invasion surprise prize
Mother fucker Pow! Pow! Lay fuck down now
No, no, don't try to talk your way out
Because I’m usually non-violent, positively vibing
But every now and then, you got a nigga wanna try you
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood, how you really suppose to handle it
Pardon me one moment: I just went off on a tangent
*Laughs*

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Typical day off in the A [aye]
But nicks on the Chevrolet, [aye]
Nigga wanna rob okay, [okay]
Way stand his where he lay, [aye]
Keep looking at me what, a gangsta grill
And I'mma give your ass, a gangsta’s pill
That’s a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain’t live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes
Done like dishes, It’s a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi you said a word, I’ll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust there motherfucker head
*Laughs*

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
We ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'
Out here wildin' don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
Out here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up
As the wheels: Keep spinnin', we grinnin', billin', straight pimpin'
Out here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up
Now we knowin’, holdin', showin', controllin'
Out here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up

[Hook Janelle Monae (Sleepy Brown]
We spend summer dreaming when we coulda be leaving [Whoo]
(Out here wildin' don't give a fuck)
(See you when the sun come up)
I guess I’ll catch you in your dreams
I guess I’ll catch you in your dreams
(Out here wildin' don't give a fuck)
(See you when the sun come up)
I guess I’ll catch you in your dreams

[Outro: Janelle Monae]
I guess I’ll catch you in your dreams
