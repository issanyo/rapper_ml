[Verse 1: Sir The Baptist]
If I want to birth a nation
I gotta get love off that auction block
We wrote our proclamation
This is Martin on mountain tops
He protest for the press
That boy's shucking and jiving
(Oh is that your chief?)
I see she ducking and hiding
My daddy did it for meals but that's just not who I am
Nat Turner's revolt, I won't preach Uncle Sam
I only preach for the hood, I only preach for the fam
I pray they sing a new song
I pray this song is that jam

[Hook: Sir The Baptist]
Mama say she gonna lose me

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I smoke a seven no less
I am in heaven and blessed
I am as high as a kite
I am the truth and the light
Angels directing my way
Enemies all held at bay
The devil that had his way with me, but he will not conquer today
Rolling and joking and smoking with Jesus and all his disciples
I'm running with gangsters, not angels, nobody killing they rivals
Rolling my joints on my bible
No pulling rifles
I am a blessing today
I am not stressing today
High and I'm holy
Holy ghost step in the way, hey

[Hook: Sir The Baptist]
