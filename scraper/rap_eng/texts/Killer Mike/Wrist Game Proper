My wrist game proper so I had whip it
Wanted me a Rover so I had to get it
Sick of being broke so a nigga went and did it
Money in the world and so I gotta get it

My wrist game proper how they gon stop us
My wrist game proper how they gon stop us
My wrist game proper how they gon stop us
My wrist game!

[Tef Poe Verse 1]
War Machine 2 shit nigga I ain't done yet
Ready for the world that’s my muthafuckin' concept
Niggas killin’ niggas don't nobody give a damn
The same people that was droppin’ bombs on Japan
My wrist game proper never know remorse
My uncle was 21 when he went and bought a Porsche
Seen him cruise through the hood with the A/C blasting
Real dope boy gave a fuck about rapping
Pine Lawn - Wellston
Cocaine crazy
Wrist game proper
Dope game baby
It send a nigga right to hell if it do sale
I know mo' niggas in jail than I do Yale
Young and I'm black
I swallow my regrets
My wrist game bought mama a living room set
Jumping off the porch got about a 100 fears
Cuz them crackers gave my nigga 900 years

[Killer Mike Verse]
I started small time dope game cocaine
Turning Yola in the pot like an egg yolk mane
Pyrex check but where my baking soda be?
Whippin’ in the kitchen but I ain’t talkin groceries
And I'm standin’ at the stove, I'm turnin' turnin', turnin'
Turn the eye down the yellow burnin’ burnin’ burnin’
I'm watching drug commercials
Its funny funny funny
Cuz I'm whippin’, whippin’, whippin’, and I'm earning earning money
They Just say No!
I just say blow!
And when them junkies in the trap I just say, yo!
If you need it then I got it
That's a definite not probably
And I'm honest so I promise its gonna beam you up to Scottie
Fuck can't feel your face
Bitch you can't feel yo body
Ain't cut that shit enough
Left a junkie catatonic
He woke up sayin' gaddamn!
That shit was the chronic
What a compliment to cooking skills
My wrist say it is honored!
