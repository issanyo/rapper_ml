[Michael Jackson]
"Say, say, say, what you want
But don't, play, games..." {FURY}

[B.o.B - with Michael Jackson sample in background]
Go right ahead, say whatever you want, please
That's it? Go ahead, I'm here all day
[yawning] Ahhh
Yup! Ha ha, yup, well

[B.o.B.]
Say what you like, but I just, take a little knife, and then I
Make a little slice, and then I, take a little bite, yum!
So miss me with all that doubt, what they all talkin about?
Talkin 'bout I ain't dope? What the hell are y'all bloggin about?
I'm the authority now, and I'm the priority now
So if you ain't on my side, might as well just throw in ya towel
Oh how cocky of me! To speak so highly of me
They say I'm crazy now; I guess I'll hire a shrink
And this is just how I feel - why would I lie on a beat?
But y'all be sleepin on me, so I guess y'all (lie) on the beat
Heh! Well that went over yo' head
And I'm B.o.B a/k/a Bobby Ray so don't you ever forget, yeah

"Say, say, say, what you want" [4X]

[Playboy Tre]
Yeahhhh
It's Playboy Tre bitch I'm back, once again where the fuck we at?
Standin strong and you can run and tell them sucka niggas that
Gimme my Henn', gimme my cup, play my beat and leave me 'lone
And you can bet, I'ma bring that fuckin trophy back home
Yellin hoo-ray, hoo-rah; either way I want my moolah
Like it's payday, and I ain't leavin the game until I say say
It's (Tre Day), I fuck Deltas to the AKA's
To ghetto ass hoes who name they bad-ass son Tay-Tay
Ray-Ray, and Day-Day, I'm bustin like a AK
Fuck around and find yo' ass in a motherfuckin melee
So say what you will nigga, you can talk it, or blog it
Like diarrhea to toilet stools, I ain't comin off it - naw!

"Say, say, say, what you want" [4X]
