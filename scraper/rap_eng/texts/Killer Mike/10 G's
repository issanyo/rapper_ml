[Verse 1]
Rubberband, rubberband, bet i count a [?]
Make my man, make my man, brought your boy [?] stacks
I'mma hit the country swear to god I bring the money back
All I got is balls and my word, nigga honor that
On my grind, on my grind, grinding through the winter time
I hope you bitches stacking 'cuz I'm balling coming summer time
They [?], [?}â€‹, [?] a forty-nine
If you thirty and they flipping, bitch by now you're wasting time
Get a job, DHL, FedEx, UPS [?]
I can see your future nigga, it involves testifying
Thirty-three plus three, I'm on my [?] grind
Thirty-three [?] so am I
White girl, white girl, sitting right beside me
You can call her Coco and refer to me as Ice-T
Ice-T, Ice-T, I can get it nightly
It's six in the morning when you broke niggas yawning

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Thirty grand, thirty grand, just to be on TV screens
I went from slingin' [?] through the winter to the spring
Now I'm winning [?] and I'm doing spring [?]
Like Pimp C and Bung B, I'm an underground king
Making underground money 'cuz I'm on my grind, dummy
Niggas ask me where I've been: making fucking money, dummy
Used to chopping grams homie, now I'm chopping syllables
And them crackers cut me checks and pay me some residuals
Independent, indipendent, making money on my own
Grind Time Official nigga, this the label that I own
Did 10 shows last month and bought another home
More than a million dollars, dropped that shit like it's a microphone
That's the shit that Mike is on, Mike is on that other shit
Ever city seems like Mike is with another chick
That's ok 'cuz when I'm gone I know she on another dick
I know you don't love me, bitch you on that bullshit
