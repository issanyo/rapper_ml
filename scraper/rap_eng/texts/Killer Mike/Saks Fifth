[Intro]
Hey Bigga

Can a bitch get at least some Jimmy Chou
Can a nigga get action
You seen that new prada baby
I see it (can I get those too)
Of course, uh huh (let’s go)

Verse 1
Fat boy fly boy
Saks fifth avenue
Fitted cap Prada shoes
Both of them [?] blue
Pockets like the monks
Big lumps like speed bumps
Hoes see you slowing down
Next you know it’s going down
Whole lotta sucking now blowing now
I can turn a virgin territory to a sea and city
Hoe in town
I ain’t never pimped but I keep a lotta hoes around
No this ain’t the mall bitch I just got some clothes around
George junk apartment I just keep the blow around
Looking for the Pyrex pot and baking soda now
Hot plate hot plate
Tell me what you see
If I'm dropping 28 and I bring back 43
I don’t really give a fuck they charging 30 for a key
I break a brick down too
I'll mix and put that bitches on 3
If you looking for a real Atlanta D-boy that’s me
If you looking for a real Atlanta DJ that’s Scream
If you looking for a nigga holding down that GA
Then you talkin’ bout my partner player DJ MLK
Don’t be asking how I know pussy nigga cause I say

Before you start acting like a stank hoe

Until yo tag was still sticking out the back of that
Monkey ass dress you wearing
That monkey dress but um, it’s ok
You know I’ma introduce you to some other shit
