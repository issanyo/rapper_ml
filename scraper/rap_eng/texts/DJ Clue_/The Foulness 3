[Intro: Nas]
Yo, to the Q.B. militia, yo
Big Nature all seasons, coming through for all reasons
Escobar, check this shit yo

[Verse 1: Nature]
Dearly departed, for years I reminisce inhaling chocolates
To my nemesis, partners in crime, corner the market
My persona glistens, devise plots and propositions
Walk slow, trey-ocho cocked to stop all existence
God portray the don  Giuliani couldn't buy me
The key to New York, plus weeds for secret mommies
Should I leave this trife shit behind me?
It's time to breeze
Plant my roots overseas and have my seeds speaking Guyanese
Fuck it for now, profile playing these corners
Pumping base, chasing papers while peeping for jake informants
Escaping warrants, they had my face in the post
Plus evidence dusted my prints but they couldn't trace the toast
This game's a death trap
I strive for deficits, bitches and setbacks
Triple six, camouflage the niggas rocking X hats
Emotionally scarred from being left back
I swerve, Q.B. to the world beyond thugs preserve

[Verse 2: Nas]
It's war nowadays, ain't nothin' changed since my child age
Ducking straight shots, mad cops, you know the foul play
Loose rocks, counting dice, no cars but mountain bikes
Bullet proofed up, blue and white vans the housing type
Screwing niggas, fake fiends be coming through on niggas
Coppin' cracks then flip out a walkie talkie foolin' niggas
Trapped in a cold world naked and ashamed
Blunts flame, my niggas locked up under alias names
Hurry up and bail em, before his finger prints match
Warrants'll start popping up, other problems'll hatch
Need the green yo, R.I.P. yo to Nino
Who left the world blasting a .44 bino
I guess I meet you in the sequel
Heavy thoughts on my cerebral make me want to stash the desert eagle wherever we go
I hate wakes and burials, hospitals and heart paces
Bitches with scarred faces, narcs hidden in dark places
