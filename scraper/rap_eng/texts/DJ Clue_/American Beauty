I really like
What you've
Done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you (x2)

[Verse 1: Ross Allen]

Yeah this is exactly how I want it
I been looking for someone like you for a moment
And your body just stunting but that's only one component
I just love to hear you talk
Yeah my mind you can own it
We can talk about our problems or anything that'll interest me
Please baby girl I'm really feeling your energy
We can runaway to a place where we're meant to be
Especially if Trump is in office I'll have to pack my things
But of course I ain't leaving you girl
This is America baby the greatest business in the world
And we're just clients sitting at home never heard
Big city small world
Moved to the suburbs
Where I realized that everything is temporary
You can fall in love but falling out is so scary
It's inevitable so don't worry just be ready
And you just so smart baby girl I know you get it
Now it's obvious I am into you
And I really like what you've done to me
And I really need you baby can't you see
Now if you want me let me hear you sing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ross Allen]

So it's obvious I'm infatuated love
Cus you just so sexy
Damn I'm in a lust
I'll impregnate your mind let's have a baby without fucking
I'll give you a piece of mind turning nothing into something
We can talk about religion and preferences of your customs
It ain't nothing I'm accustomed to loving you without fucking
Girl...yes or no do you believe in god?
Shit, me too I need to figure it out
We spend every single day on the same escapade
Looking for answers to life when it's really in our face
So no I don't really care what the preacher say
Or what the words say in the bible on every page
Imma just do me cus who else in your grave
I'm just looking for a muse someone to push me to fame
And it's obvious I'm into you
And I like what you do
Baby can't say you see
Please lemme hear you sing
