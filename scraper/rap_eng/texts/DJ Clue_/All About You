[Verse 1]
Smell all in my bed and your body don't play around
So baby when we lay up its kinda hard not to lay it down
Still ain't perfect but give me time and I'll work it out, I will
I will, so you know just what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you hold the crown
A million girls can't take the place of you around
No they can't compare, they just fun for now
Know it sounds fucked up but it's the truth, but it's the truth
Between them and you

[Chorus]
Your love is the one that I choose
Cause in the end girl it's all about you
Up and down with love like we do, love like we do
But in the end girl it's all about you
They can hate and talk until there faces turn blue
Cause in the end girl its all about you
Don't listen what they say
They'll hate, your friends gon' hate
They tryna take your place
In the end girl it's all about you

[Verse 2]
Didn't nobody tell you that, that I could never go without
The sunshine you bring to my life when I'm in the clouds
Any room you walk in it's guaranteed you gon' shut it down
You will, you will so you know just what it is

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
