[Intro: DJ Clue]
Fantastic Four: Cam'ron, Pun, Nore, Canibus

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
You never hear that we buckle; beef? We chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything I put my money in, gotta see double
Unless y'all wanna see trouble, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Tell you it's crack, then hand a vial ?
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they lick my balls right after I play ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. Hear what I say y'all?O.K. y'all. Ask AJ y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like Stacy Dash, she was eatin' Tracy ass at this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up Desert Storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the Don fall
But I'll come inside The Tunnel, nigga, wit Pope John Paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on Street Soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
Keep 2 bones and 2 phones in each Rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace is all we asking, but I get buck wild like Corey Jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin Nicholi (/nicks), nigga, like Volkof
Know what I mean yo? Notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like El Nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though jumpin outta Lex Coupe
With Jimmy Jones right next to me in the Benz Truck too

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Fuck all y'all non-believers, I roll wit God, the squad and T.S
Out wit the BS; we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain brolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down with the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the Devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit, now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in back of the Ac
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

[Noreaga]
Talk about huh? That's what we talk about thug shit

[Verse 3: Noreaga]
Now what's a symphony, without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My jewels shit on cats without Tiffany
N-O-R-E, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the whip on any street
I fuck wit Clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with Clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' Nore lay pretty low
But them niggas is [ho]mos just like the Maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of Chico DeBarge
Thugged Out's 1st lady (let's go half on a baby)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thou on my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ayo, the President is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get head too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, "go head boo"
Thugged Out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, Cam'Ron and Punisher too
And the beats usually done by Duro and Clue

[Verse 4: Canibus]
Who the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign, far from being boring
My style is hard like Castle without McCormick
I run through your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like AIDS cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a Street Fighter like Jean Claude
And I'll split your shit, par
Right down the middle, play you like a fiddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the Desert Storm annual extravaganza
Crew rolls deeper than the Cartwrights on Bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in Porsches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit, I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of "cannabis" that's side-effectless
The type of shit that get the Question-mark Man arrested
Take evasive action, flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on MCs to watch their meat blacken
You try to get fly, you get electrified and fried
And fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me or walk away without a black eye
Word up hops, Clueminat' call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, the cops call SWAT
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the National Guard
Ready or not like the Fugees, crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable, look at what CLUEminati did to you
The maximum lyrical, nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you

Motherfucker... CLUEminati '98
