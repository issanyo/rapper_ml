Yo..

AKA William P. Holla
Man, this my nigga Clue

You know how we do this man
Word to mutha, man
Yo... Yo...

[Ty Shaun]
It's desert storm motherfucker, hit the floor, times up
No question entertainment got ya cap lined up
I bag for chips big guns and fly whips
Bitches with bright red lips and wide hips
Who crazed with thugged-out niggas with long dicks
I'ma mad man, you can call me a convict
Gunnin niggas down and I'm known for ice picks
My cliques some iced out niggas who bomb shit
Desert storm, catch your bodies in bare arms
Ty Nitty run the city, but Clue is the don
QU diplomats, throwin slugs at y'all
Niggas floor skirts and clap pom poms
Tranvets and wearing ya thong thongs
I'm spittin' from the heart tearin' niggas apart
Sixteen bars is like sixteen thugs
Blow a hole in your face and mail your family the parts
Motherfucker!
