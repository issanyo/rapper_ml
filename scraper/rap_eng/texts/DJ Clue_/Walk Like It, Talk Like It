Come On!

[Ransom:]
Ma' you still playin around
On the couch, layin around
The money prob'ly why you stayin around
Or could it be I'm layin it down
But I ain't stupid or naive
I know what turn your face to a frown:
No cash, no ice, no lacin you down
No Jags, no bikes, no blazin the town
Don't ask no price, you ain't breakin me down
I've been an asshole! Why you start hatin me now?
I ain't never spent a cake on a clown
In your bedrooms scrapin it down
The bed shakin the ground
All of a sudden you're fakin it now
Tellin your friends I was weak
And you was never makin a sound
I'm a king, you can tell by the shape of the crown
I can sling, ain't no bird-brain makin me drown
Got brass so they're chasin me now
When I see 'em they get a hug
And I ain't seen shakin a pound

(Chorus)
Now if he walks like it and talks like and whores like it
Then most likely the nigga's a P-iiimp
And if he boss-type in his Porsche dual exhaust pipe
And he getting kitted, the lady's a Ch-aaamp

[Stack Bundles:]
Look, I'm the colonel when it comes to these chickens
I'm like Ernie when it comes to these Berts (birds)
I move weight like curves
Keep your Y-3's under the perps
I'm so hood but I keep a bougie bitch from the burbs
When I get up, I got a bitch
I honest gotta bitch
I just low with 16 like StojakoviÄ‡
Back hand mean, I won't hesi' to pop a bitch
Give her one more chance, I'm on the "dick-poppin" shit
IT'S OKAY! No, I'm sorry, I'm just poppin shit
I don't do them wrong, at least not on the first night
I let them taste it when they don't even deserve like
Then leave with at least two or more on my worst night

(Chorus)
Now if he walks like it and talks like and whores like it
Then most likely the nigga's a P-iiimp
And if he boss-type in his Porsche dual exhaust pipe
And he getting kitted, the lady's a Ch-aaamp

[Fabolous:]
You want a nigga to meet the parents
Then you better call Ben Stiller, miss
Hammer ain't got nothin on the way I spend Skrilla, miss
I'm rich on that: "Maybe chinchilla this!"
Make the diamonds talk for me like a ventriloquist
My chain sayin: "Bitch I know you tryina hang
We can link up and get into all kind of things"
My watch say: "No need to be embarrassed
You know what time it is: quarter past a hundred carats."
They believe in a god. I get'em to their true religion
Teasin them with bread but truthfully I'm through with pigeons
Now I leave them in a coop on the roof top
Then fly through in the new coupe with the roof dropped
I ain't wanna prolongue on
Tryina slow song John
Put mine until 'So goin on - ONE
And please don't jump to assume
If we hump in the room
The next morning we'll be jumpin the broom
Better find another chump for your broom
Cause baby I'm a player till I'm slumped in a tomb
And yo, I got a slow stroke
That'll get a law broke
Hit'em like drow smoke
Mixed with the raw coke
The way the flow spoke
Have a girl's drawers soaked
Nigga this is no joke
How I have them whores broke
Payin for attention
I'm sorta like a gigolo
Call me Fab Schneider - a young Bigalow
(Niggas know)

(Chorus)
Now if he walks like it and talks like and whores like it
Then most likely the nigga's a P-iiimp
And if he boss-type in his Porsche dual exhaust pipe
And getting kitted the lady's a Ch-aaamp

[Fabolous talking:]
Niggas know me, man
Tell your bitch I said "Hi", man
Don't have me picking up my phone and shit
It's cool, though, I'ma see her
