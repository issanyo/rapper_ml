[Jadakiss]
Yeah, what the fuck?

[Sheek]
L.O.X. baby
Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Styles too
Black Rob, what the fuck, all up in this motherfucker

[Jadakiss]
Bad boy
Stay back, nigga

[Sheek]
Ay yo, if it ain't G's you stuffin' in my pocket
Nigga stop it
That bullshit you talking go reherse that at Rockets
Puff lye I pay dues, that nigga with a tattoo
The thin Ha, these motherfuckers gonna watch the Little
Rascals
When I say I bust my shit, believe it all the way
And the summer times where the Chochas show where one in her leg
If you could walk still, every block in Yonkers be hot still
With miners that will bust you down faster than cops kill
Niggas still front and step to you, falsely accused
That they just shot and you can still be the judge boo
I die for my 354 niggas, with the young stoned niggas
Lox are my heart, cold niggas
Sheek give it to you, like a bitch with a disease
That got AIDS on her lips and wish and hope you bleed
So if you want it, Fuck It!
In the Benz I'll be there, you gonna rot like
A dead Luco (spanish slang) under the stairs

[Blackrob]
Yeah yo, I swing that ass through the E-R, now I'm out the D-R
Heared in New York, y'all was looking for the B-R
Lads is sweatin' us, we are four of the baddest
I'm the one that go stick you for all the cabage
The icon, doing this shit since Stride-on
Perpitrating ass niggas like you, I keep my eye on
I rake em, roll em, like smoke from Peter Ross
Then I hold em, stole em, work hard to be the boss
My fashion is Kumb-a-i, or else I'm attackin'
Dukes frontin acting like they toughest then napkins
Spittin', them bullshit crimes I stay hittin'
Not forgeting, the bullshit crimes and ass whippings
The whole 9, I dont waste time, I brace mines from the waistlines
Niggas is scared to face mine
See I'm a criminal, so after this interview
I'ma bend a few, Fuck It! Could be ten of you
I put one into you, I promise to God
It's about time y'all niggas pay homage to Rob

[Styles]
You can catch me on the low with a Calendar bitch
I got blow and she bagging the shit
Comin' thru in a '98 wagon, lavender shit
Imagine the shit, mystery like ???
Cop in the truck the S-P cock and he dump
You can find me with my enemy coppin' his lunch
When I'm finished niggas ask which block do I want
My pockets is lumped, find me on a yacht with a blunt
What you know about dime bitches cockin' the pump
Watchin the Don, I learned to market heroin
I mean the valuble, celebrate with stuck off the Malibu
Science is the game and it's all mathematical
Pearl white Porche, licence plate "radical"
It's real when the fedaral-ies in Cali get mad at you
The get that, Lox on the block want the shit back
Ain't ours in the first place, still let us get that

[Jadakiss]
Niggas acting like Jada, won't grab the 3-8-0 with the potato
And clap at niggas in broad day though
You know the flow, where it come from and where it go
Or where it's gonna be at, that's where we at
I touch you if you think I'm jiggy with the Puff
Move and still sellin' forty-thousand a week so Fuck You!
Three niggas you dont want none of
Make your insides feel like the summer
You gettin' Dumber & Dumber
While we get smarter and smarter, makin' shit harder and harder
We took this rap game like the Carter
I'm Nino, Styles is Rothstein from Casino
And Sheek is the boss of the Hennisey gambino
We talking millions, you talking C-notes
You used to stash dope in our ski coats, couldn't play sweet though
You know the Kiss, on the low in the mist
Blowin' 'Dro and sipping Red Ally and Moe with a bitch
When my niggas'll flip, see how cute you look
In the box with the suit on how you used to look
Hard body with a purple faced future look
Future crook, the same nigga who's boots I took
Giuliani ain't a motherfuckin' joke
Got mad niggas broke, a lot of niggas gettin' bad coke
When they bring it to the lab, if it's totally slab
First felony, you still gettin' four and a half
