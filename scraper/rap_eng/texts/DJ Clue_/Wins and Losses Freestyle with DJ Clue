[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

I got the key to the streets
I got the key to the safe
He wanna see what I'm selling
I put the key in his face
I just got back from the dealer, i got the key to the Wraith
I got the key to the Bentley Truck
When I leave the booth, I'm gone pick it up
Facts, when I'm in my hood, shit I do what I wanna
250 im spinnin'  the corner
You better get busy you running up on us, no rat
Ain't no rat nigga
Play on my nigga you know you a goner
Play on my nigga you know they gone hit you
These niggas be hating the fuck is they issue?
They mad, ah damn, busting it down on my real ones
They kill each other for lil ones
We tryna set up the lil ones
Loyalty only thing matter to me
We bout to bust up some millions
Niggas is ready civilians
We the type never to [?]
Wait, wait wait, walk in and blow when I step in it
I'm from the P and I'm repping it
Seen it with me that's a definite
That was your chick, better check on it
I write a name, put a check on it
She suck my dick get a check for it
Im tripping
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, Maybach in this bitch
Back to back and the black on black Maybach Maybach getting rich
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, when she suck this Maybach dick
Maybach Maybach does that shit
Timing is money and money is time
Hustle like I'm bout to run out of time
Step to a chump in the front of the line
Get on my level I been in the mix
Blue on Rick 'Rari like Optimus Prime
Most of these niggas be popping these pills
Don't know what they talking, they out of they mind
They sipping that lean and popping them percys a thousand a time
They said that they goons get not full bodied they dropping a dime
You said he a hitter, why you was lying?
He hit the district, he posting them pictures and crying for mom
Niggas is rats, gang
Living that shit I was rapping and rapping this shit I was trapping
We catch them niggas in traffic
That F N 5 7 drop 21 on 'em no savage
I ain't not doing no rapping
That 2500 my sneakers three thousand my jacket
Niggas be thinking that I'm into fashion
I'm being Neiman's just ball in the snap
Double M G, we gone crush y'all
If it's fuck me, you know its fuck y'all
Bitch ass niggas, they don't want war
All these choppers in the crib look like a gun store
And the rose gold look like duck sauce in the Maybach
With a young broad why the fuck would I give a fuck for?
We don't lose sleep by the fuck boy
Sending hits like a drug lord, Pablo
Dog food like Ralo
If they all move then they die slow, pronto
Mixing that Louis, that Gucci, that east Saint Laurent with diamond Milano
Feeling that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-0
Who motivate niggas if I go?
Name one at the ClearPort, where you can't come
Eating, finger-licking on the G5
Prime state with the A1
When it come to rappers, I don't be with niggas
I'm still mobbing on them with my day ones
Lil shorty try to play the kid (KIdd) but I'm Jason
Handle that rod like it's And 1
Talking hot sauce when I pop off with the top off
Finna Wraith fan from a popstar
Man I live a life niggas would die for
This that young nigga talk at the dealer shit
When you killing shit, on some winner shit
At the VMA's with the 30 on me
In the front row and who with the shits
Cause these fuck niggas say they want smoke
When we run into 'em we gone kill the shit
Talking really quick
Keep the strap on me like a nigga bitch
All these racks on me I feel nigga rich
Yeah you know, all these racks on me, I feel nigga rich
All these racks on me, I feel nigga rich

I'm tired this the end of the night
I swear to God I ain't go to sleep last night
Hey Clue, I swear to God you better stop doing your show at nighttime too Clue
Wins and Losses is in stores right now, Meek Milly its your boy checking in
NYC, you already know what it is we in this bitch, gang

Back to back and the black on black Maybach Maybach getting rich
