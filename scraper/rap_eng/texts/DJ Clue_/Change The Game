Gotti Jigga and Daz Dillinger, killin' ya with the pound
With Roc La Familia

Deep in and out, out gold Daytonas
D cut through with 2 way Motorolas
Nigga the Dynasty and the Pentagon motherfucker
Hollow tip, stainless Teflon motherfucker
Jigga trigger, cock-a-poppa, nigga chest rocka
With the chrome chopper, Glock'll pop a nigga so quick
Saddam Niastra, y'all done stepped in the mud
And about to feel ery'thing from the flat foot

Calicos collective, have you ever seen a
Four so clean like a brand new nina
My nigga Daz
Sigel Sigel
Jigga, Memph, in bad ass Impalas
Butt naked bitches and pop collars
The popular scholar, this is the beginnin'
With the hollow tips soarin', chrome wheels spinnin'
Never have you ever seen a G like me
Rollin' with the Roc, straight D P G

Don't change the game for these hoes
Who plays the game like we supposed

For 2Pac they yellin' ra da da da da da
Not a Blood or a Crip but I put drugs on the strip
Put dubs on the whip, got bigger guns
Than the fuzz on my hip, cock back let it rip
Won't stop that 'til the whole clip's gone

Blowed out chromed out, swervin' through ya town

Laid back actin' a nut, waitin' to 'rupt
No remorse as we bust, let you feel the dust
Dogg Pound, Roc-A-Fella straight fuckin' it up
Let it be known, Daz Dillinger, rough to the bone
All alone, roam ya neighborhood high

High stylin', profilin', y'all comin' after me
In actuality they fake the technicality
Dogg Pound Roc-A-Fella that's my family

And we stalk and we do what we do after dark
Get one shot Dillinger Roc La Familia

Don't change the game for these hoes

Sigel Sigel in the house
Uh huh, sick bastard
Even mo' sicker ya brain get mo' twisted

Sigel, two Desert Eagle hit you niggas up quick
Got 'em diggin' ditches up quick
Got you niggas spittin' up 'cause I'm sick
Gettin' up slow from hits from the fifth
Let a row go quick from the clip

Shit, sit a nigga down quick when I'm pitchin' a bitch
You see light then you takin' a trip
Five hours, spill a clip and make the hammer dance
I'll holla, while you holla in the ambulance
Stop, it's the Roc nigga R O C
With the D O G on ya block
Fuck the C O P's, let me see those trees
No stems, no sticks, no seeds, just breathe

Relax bitch, don't act bitch, we don't stop
It's the R O C, geah who forgot
You never thought Bleek walk on a track before
Hit a switch in a black 6-4 before
Down on sunset I run sets, I does that
Niggas look at me and be like damn I was that
I'm the Understanding with my peeps, fuck foes
Got a house in the back with a Benz and dough

Get cha mind right nigga 'fore you mention me
Your click ain't too thorough to mention we
Don't matter who we collab' with, nigga it's a classic
Dogg Pound linked with the Roc could 'cause traffic
Who want rump, get it crunk with me
I'm Bleek, you a got a gun wanna dump with me?
You catch Bleek in B.K. or down in L.A
With my W and E up nigga, who want play?

Psycho, like no, bitch ass nigga so
When you see the R O to the C sneak creep low
I will not, lose
