You be killin' but, mine be slaughtering
Phil get em outta there, don't ever bring your daughter in
DC and Maryland, out here my name they hollering
Always on the move so money I U-Haul it in
I can't call it, everyday it something new
In the store, in the air abusing the jet blue
Yeah you knew I am the heir, Royal Fam is the crew
368 is the label that's the plan till I'm through
We ain't trying man, we doing it
Cup with some brew in it, the game be getting cold
I don't fold I just blew in it, a nigga on the way
I don't see how you could ruin it
On my shine bright shit, I can get the sewer lit
Ma, give me brain till you don't have a clue in it
I gotta van waitin' all that's missin is you in it
She like "Boy please, ask if ???"
Bitch, this the club I can find another you in it
There's only one me, see the pimp ???
I'm hot nigga make it hard to figure where the sun be
Crocodile Dundee, my niggas get wild
We don't stand for no whack shit, nigga sit down
Haters I urinate em off, cause they made of ???
Now I'm getting what's in store because I paid the cost
Fuck you, pay me, now relay the message
My career is sure shot, ya'lls are made of guesses
I'm the essence of hip hop, no slangin' I spit rocks
Tell em that the future's at hand like a wrist watch
Clubbing nasty youngin' but no I don't kiss box
You niggas couldn't fit in my shoes with six socks
I'm sick make the doc have a nervous break down
When nigga on the road told dre take the breaks down
I'mma have to drive till my vehicle breaks down
Ask if I'm ready, I'll be making that tre sound
I'm too ill with it, no deal but ya still gotta deal with it
Cause I'mma bet like I bet steven hill with it
Top of the hill my swagger is jack and jill with it
And pack a steel, still run with a pack that do
Winnerâ€™s Circle, the 2011 Rat Pack Crew
And in my A with James up in the black black cruise
And make my name your main bitch lower back tattoo
And I'm gone
