[Noreaga]
Them niggas really think that it's a game but it's not
Niggas kept frontin', Brown got popped
Word on life, word on my click
All a niggas really got in his life is his word and his dick
And I stay true to them like both of them laws
Niggas talk shit my click's not ridin' them dogs
Niggas hate me cause broke and can't floss
Yo I cop coke, cook it up - y'all buy it cooked already
Like a '98 six wild like a Chevy
Yo I floss now, look how much my jewels cost now
I'm realizin' that you me so I hate y'all too
So both sides is hate so it's mutual
Beautiful, my guns make it shoot-able
Shoot at you send staff to clap you
Yo my name's Nore but only fam calls me Papi
That nigga's homo like the cat who killed Versace
Homo thug, yo I shoulda known sooner
My clique stay in jail like Robert Downey Jr
Like Outlaw in the beacon, I'm nigga-Rican
Most y'all niggas think y'all live, while y'all weaklings
I'm from Iraq, play the cut smoke mad trees
Mind my own business, concentrate on my cheese
Yo the door lock, four knocks and one symbol
I'm like '98 Live, y'all like Double Dribble
Aye yo, thugged out, no rules, I'm playin' the game
Every man for hisself, just recievin' the pain
It's like Utah, 21, no out, just go hard
Rest in piece I gotta say to Yammy and Todd
It's like niggas never learn, money to burn
Yo I'm leavin' like me and Nat' shit (I'm leavin'!!) let me say this
I used to rock to G-U-E with the SS
Now I'm in the '98 black GS
Golden with kid in my shit, on some full grits headlights
Shit shine from Def Jam to Crown Heights
Now my clique keep guns, time to fight
Open the flip on the Startac and check the message
Copped ten Sprint phones and caught a deal
What, one and the same, like Thugged Out and Ill Will

It's all real, still from Iraq...
