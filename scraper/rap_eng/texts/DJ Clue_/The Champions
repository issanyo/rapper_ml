[Intro: DJ Clue]
Yeah it's the world famous dj Clue, Desert Storm
And I'm the motherfuckin reason you go to masterin
You make one copy of your album, and you walk around with it
In your motherfuckin back pocket, that's right man, that's me
That they call me, word up
World famous dj Clue, Kayslay, "The Champions"
It's about to go down niggas
[Funkmaster Flex]
That's what I'm talkin about, Funkmaster Flex, "The Champions"
Big Dogg Pitbulls, we fuckin focused, ya heard!!
[Doo Wop]
Yo, cuts razor sharp like headliners
You ain't gotta book a major artist, we headliners
Pack 'em in like Starkist tuna
Doo Wop, if you thirty and better, call me Charlie Chase Jr
But if conceived after '73, address me as the Puerto Rican Eric B
Big chain swingin, cd hustlin, mixtape slingin (Damn!)
I'll be around 'til your body rot
And if the Feds bring me in, I get the same lawyer Puffy got
[Brucie B] It's non-stop boogie, we boogie non-stop nigga
[Tony Touch]
Aiyyo, mixtape champions; nah, it can't be them
Touch rhymin, Slay right behind him
Heavyweight shit, y'all all nickel and dime-in
We still Latin quarters, the game's back in order
It's not a thing, I blast off like bada-bing
From Bushwick to Harlem, we showed 'em how to sling
Toca, shuttin 'em down with Drama King
Cause a lot of these so-called rappers is out of sync
[Brucie B]
It's the world famous Brucie B with the Drama King
And we gon' lay it down like this
[DJ Kayslay]
I'm the Streetsweeper, A. K. A, dj beater
The first cat to admit the "Takeover," wasn't better than "Ether"
Kayslay, and I changed the game
I got beef with a coward I'ma call his na
