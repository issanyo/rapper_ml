[Hook: French Montana]
We coming to clean up
She busting it wide open when she seen us
Where's your bitch, haven't seen her, ay
We coming to clean up
Young rich fly nigga
.45 rise nigga
Don't ride with my niggas
You don't wanna try niggas

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Sniffing [?] you high nigga
Or you deaf, dumb, blind nigga
Its the coke boy mob nigga
We don't rep, we gon rob nigga
Hustling was a job nigga
You ain't never hustled, had a job nigga
Yous a spy nigga
And your bitch is a fly nigga
Stuffed like a African to a fly nigga
Small face, all your time nigga
Small place with your mom nigga
That ain't mine nigga
Haan

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Baby these my whips
Baby this ain't rented
Everything fishbowl nothing is tented
Icing on the cake, its a real nigga in it
Wanna talk millions, bitch I got plenty
These my hoes, nigga these my bitches
These my goons, they gon' handle my business
Condo ceiling, looking for the engine
I was in the front, that's the trunk [?]
I got suicide doors, yeah my car need watching
Bitch I'm confident, and ain't never been cocky
Jeans ain't strapped if ya still gotta cock it
Rock a bye baby, pop it

[Hook]
