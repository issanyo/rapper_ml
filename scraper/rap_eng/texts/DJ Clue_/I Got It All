Yea, DJ Clue

Chorus
Lemme breathe
Everything
Ice he sees
Diamond rings
Whatever you want
I got it all
But I gotta let you know
Always watch
Out for those
Triflin friends
Tryna play the role
Next to me
It'll never be
So I wana let you know

Verse 1
Never see me out with no ametures
We only need to see yours and managers
The ice bright from southern cali canada
But you hater out here
I gots to damage ya
Ya pissed coz I'm on a speed boat
In maowi hanging
I be six four
Hoppin out in cali swangin
But it's hard to find me though
I stay deep
With a team that's
Grimey though
U ain't know

Bridge
Ayo everything we droppin
Be like fire
Something you can feel
Keep keep on
Keep keep on
Keep keep on

Ayo everything we droppin
Be like fire
And it's oh so real
Keep keep on
Keep keep on
Keep keep on

Chorus
Lemme breathe
Everything
Ice he sees
Diamond rings
Whatever you want
I got it all
But I gotta let you know
Always watch
Out for those
Triflin friends
Tryna play the role
Next to me
It'll never be
So I wana let you know

Verse 2
Yo my neck chuncky
