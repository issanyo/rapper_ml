[Intro]
Get Live, To the hoop ya'll
Get live, 2003
Get live, Swish, woohoo!

[Verse 1]
Scribble on the wall
Got them dribbling the ball
It's the number one player in the game
Hoop ya'll. Think
Ain't no thing could see my game
Its to back you down and bang on you
Get live
Imma bring it to your whole team
Tryin to win the whole thing
Size me up for the ring
Haha. I'm celebratin' while the other team mad
With their head down hatin
Get live
And waitin to get another rematch
But we ain't trying to see that
Believe that next
Homie yo game is weak
Mine's a sweep
I'm riding on a 7 game winning streak
Get Live
Bustin them up
Tossing them up
Crossing them up
Crushing them up, what?
You can't stop my reign
EA Sports and Snoop Dogg it's in the game

[Hook]
Get Live
You brought them the game
It's all in the game
Who in the hall of fame
Who read in the game
NBA live homie is a glide of rain
It's big snoop dogg to the hoop dog

Get Live
You brought them the game
It's all in the game
Who in the hall of fame
Who read in the game
Nobody alive has been good enough to beat me yet
It's in the game

[Verse 2]
Comin down like a rhino
Me and my boys will be waitin in the finals
1 on 1 or 5 on 5
I'm the coldest when comes down to it ah
Get live
Shoot from the in or the outside
I'm on a mission, you on the exhibition
Stay off the big, payoff im in the playoffs
Who you playin with
Who you rollin with
Get live
Its the season im in another season
And to win a tournament that be the reason
Fact is I don't need practice
But you do cuz yo team seem to lack this skill that I got
Get live
I get hop, my shot my spitter pop
Man I got it locked haha
You can't stop my reign
It's EA Sports Snoop dog its in the game

[Hook]
You brought them the game
It's all in the game
Who in the hall of fame
Who read in the game
NBA live homie is a glide of rain
To the hoop ya'll, to the hoop ya'll
It's in the game
You brought them the game
It's all in the game
Who in the hall of fame
Who read in the game
Nobody alive has been good enough to beat me yet
To the hoop ya'll
It's in the game
