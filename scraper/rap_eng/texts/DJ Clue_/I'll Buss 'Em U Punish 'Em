[Canibus]
Yeah, I'll buss 'em, and you punish 'em
Uhh, yeah

[Hook: Canibus and Rakim]
[C] Let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'mma punish 'em
[C] Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'mma punish 'em
[C] Naw, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'mma punish 'em
[C] Come on Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Yo 'Bis, you can punish 'em

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Now on some battling shit, my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the A-Dat when I'm tracking my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits cause I'm back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditating on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign
With a deeper conscience than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talking, but I ignore it
Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's boring
So keep standing on the corner
The trash man will collect you in the morning
Thug cats fronting, wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the Raptor Wagon babbling about nothing
Fuck that, real Rugrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at
So dark you never see the blood splat
And you can't even react cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed cause you too scared to come back
You can't even breathe, the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MCs haul ass like they running track
Where ever Canibus or Rakim is at

[Hook: Canibus and Rakim]

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Be ready and at your best, the Celebrity Match of Death
Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath
Then I asked the ref, "How many cats is left?"
One on one, who challenging? Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishing kids
Abdomen punctured in, look what I done to his wig
Wanna live then I stab 'em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at, any place any time
Get your snot-box smashed with a nine, smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain, what it's like seeing your brain
You're insane, whose gonna ID the remains?
And then I reincarnate 'em, and kill 'em again
Again and again, again and again, c'mon

[Hook: Canibus and Rakim]

[Verse 3: Canibus and Rakim]
[Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo we started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
And chopped him in the Adam's apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So I'ma twist 'em up like a pretzel then I'ma tag you

[Rakim]
I'm on some Stone Cold shit, warn your whole clique
Cartilage getting torn until the whole bone split
Who want to spit, bang 'em quick, strangle 'em wit his lip
Try to flip, leave his body dangling by his hip

[Canibus]
Ra, you left him dangling
I can't believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like I'm dancing with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10

[Rakim]
Seven birds make 'em swerve till their vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard

[C] Let me finish 'em
[R] Nah, its time to pin 'em
[C] Ra, lemme finish 'em
[R] Nah, I'mma pin 'em
[C] Nah, Lemme finish 'em
[R] Nah, it's time to pin 'em
[C] C'mon, Ra, lemme finish 'em
[R] Nah 'Bis, I'mma put it in 'em
