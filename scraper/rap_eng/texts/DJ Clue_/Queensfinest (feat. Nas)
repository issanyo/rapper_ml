Slick Rick chains ill nigga
Get brains with the f**kin Hilfiger nah
Shit changed I gotta rock somethin' flier
McGiver get outta shit smooth like that, get higher
In these kicks, prince sneakas, and jogging suits
Robbin truce, while my revolver shoots
Chinky eyed, devilish grin
Purple range rovers, wakin up with hangovers
God damn I need my brain sober
So I jump up in the ride and slide
Me and my nigga Jungle, Clue just called he copped the purple 5
Damn nigga's is live, Queensed out
Got to put the card hard jeans on
I feigned out, til this light green caliw eed
Henessey dro, use to only cop dub sacks but now I cop a o
Six double oh, I trick a couple hoe's
Get em in my car, dirty shit all in the f**kin floor
Clean that shit up now throw in outside
Took about four hundred G's to cop the bulletproof ride
Bentley azure, yo we on award tour
We got a show on, top of the coliseum open doors
Let them rock-a-way nigga's in
Queens bridge startin' shit, chill, calm it down we got to blend it in
School of hard knocks shirts, choppin' hurts
From the Hurst, yo corona play the sideline, yea it works
Yo when we put it all in the same fam, yo round up the queen's click
Check out the game plan

Chorus:
Queens's nigga's rock ice and smoke hydro
Keep heat for the beef and don't hide yo
Young nigga's get cash and cop pies yo

Queens bitches, stepin up with thick thighs yo

Queens nigga's rock ice and smoke hydro
Keep heat for the beef, we never hide yo
Young nigga's gettin cash and copin pies yo
Queens bitches, stepin up with thick thighs yo

Carribean brown skin
Queensed out from public housin
Comes the one known as the garson child, rappers is bowin
Look at em, they roll me red carpets
Praisin me as one of the dead profits
When I talk these nigga's heads bobbin
Strait out of queens when TNT did there first drug sting
When 1-800-Cop Shot stickers was first seen
When D.A.'s and cop killing laws was made
10 G's to a witness when seen a cop get sprayed
What's on the AG Q club or club Mercedes
Sunrise, movie theaters to chill with our ladies
Load up the 80's cause cop killin queens is crazy
40 to basely, Q gardens to woodhaven
To AQ boro that gotti was made in
Whips on the vanwick queens day and shea stadium
Anything that's transported to New York
Got a come through the gates of either 2 airports
Kennedy and LaGuardia we come through to body you
Bloodhounds follow you; wolves ill get on top of you
Push twin Camaro's paper here to Somalia
Blaze off double barrels,shells follow you

Chorus
