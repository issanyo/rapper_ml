[Verse:]
How did mixtapes change my life?
Mixtapes helped me get outta the hood
Help me provide for my family
Got me more rich than I could ever imagine
And helped me travel the world for free
And I get all the free music way before you do
I go by the name of the world famous DJ CLue
Desert Storm
One tenth of that turn up team
There are twenty three other DJ’s
You better ask somebody
Holiday let’s go!
