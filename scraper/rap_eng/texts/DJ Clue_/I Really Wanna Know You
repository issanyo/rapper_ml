[Jagged Edge] + (DJ Clue)
Come and talk to me, I really wanna meet you girl
I really wanna know your name (Fabolous!)
Whoa, come and talk to me, I really wanna meet, you girl
I really wanna, KNOW YOUR NAAAAAME (Professional 3!)
Oh yeah baby, cause you look so sexy you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I, see your face girl (Clue!)
You look so sexy you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I, see your face girl (c'mon!)

[Fabolous]
So sexy, yeah...
I need to know whatever they call you
Forever I'm loyal, do whatever to spoil you
The way you fit them jeans Seven should call you
That ass had me makin heavy withdrawals
I'm smooth when I approach and I stay on them stones
Make you move in with the coach and leave them players alone
We can talk 'bout it, get a bottle pull the cork out it
One convo' and then you in the condo (c'mon!)

[Jagged Edge]
I've been watchin you, for so very long
I'm tryin to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really wanna meet you, but I'm kind of scared
Cause you're the kind of lady, with so much class
I get my thoughts together, for the very next day
But when I see you lately I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really, turns me on
Yeah, oooh you really turn me on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Come and talk to me (my baby)
I really wanna meet you

I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you

[Jagged Edge]
Ohh, oh oh oh, oh
There you are again, the same smiley, babe
I wanna know just what it is to make you feel this way
I wish I could grab you, tell you what it means to me
See you walkin my way, and it really, makes my day
Before I go to sleep, and dream about you
I'm a single man and I hope that you are, single too (ohh baby)
Tomorrow we'll see, somethin to set my mind free
Cause to you we are so cheap thuggin the, hell outta me
Yeah babe, ohh you turn me on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

See I catch your girl eyes when I play the club
Cause they ain't seen a +Diamond+ dance like this
Since LisaRae in "The Player's Club"
They might say it's dubs but you see the way it rubs
I always say they must of missed a couple inches boo
I see them heels, you on a couple inches too
Come with me I'll show you what a couple inches do
But first, I was hopin on
We could sit and talk, you know get our Oprah on
Or we could down martinis faster than Lambourghinis
On places where they only wear trunks and bikinis
I don't talk game like a sports commentator
That get you sex now and a court problem later
I rather be real, cause even while havin these mil's
I'm down to earth like gravity still
But you, look, so sexy
You really turn, me on and on and on
And on and on and on... and on and on and on
Yeah
