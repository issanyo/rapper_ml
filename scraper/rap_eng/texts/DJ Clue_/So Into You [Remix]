[Intro : Tamia]
I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy
There's no one like you around, oh baby

[Verse 1 : Fabolous]
Babygirl
Desert Storm
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90s and the 2 thou'
Theres no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cuz the kids ready to tell you how he feel and a few vows
Maybe, I speak in general now
But girl, I'm a do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I roll, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I ain't concerned with other men with you now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a king to you now
And I ain't jealous, its the principle now I'm so into you

[Hook : Tamia]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

[Verse 2 : Fabolous]
Come on ma, it's more than a flashing (oh)
I would've traded it all in orderly fashion (oh)
My villa in Florida we crashing (oouh yeah)
Just off the shore so you can hear (oh baby)
When the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in the quota we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing the money
We oughta be stashing I make sure ever quarter be cashed in
I can't really explain it, my friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed you be smoking, what typ'a drinks you be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard, you would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards are no limits, so you don't worry about maxing
When you spends but since you've been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends

[Hook : Tamia]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

[Verse 3 : Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but the truth is girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them strips at Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dip the deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canarys and VS Dip Tay sauces
All the ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda number's impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful yeah
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this Superwoman has come to my rescue
My winters been wonderful, my summers been special
That's spot up at the bar while the villa been painted
Just so we can really get acquainted
The love is real
There's no way it can feel like its tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah

[Hook : Tamia]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

[Outro : Tamia]
I really like what I feel when I'm with you
You're a dream come true
Don't you ever leave my side (oh no)
Cause it feels so that (oooh baby ooooh)
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
