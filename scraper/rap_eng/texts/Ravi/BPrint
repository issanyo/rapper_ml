[Intro]
Aye woah, aye
Aye woah, aye
Aye aye
Aye woah, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse]
I don't politic with children
I chewed a million milligrams
Why he popped the seal then
Can't buy it, it might not be him
Who gon' get my deal then
Since they all scared of drugs and kids
Nigga where's the fun in this, I don't got no life to risk
Dead boy status I'm just here so they can tape this shit
Tape her if you dog her these hoes lying 'bout some sacred shit
Mother and her daughter and my sister for a basic bitch
Gave a hoe my all and still complainin' 'bout some basic shit
Face this shit, I can't, kick a habit, I won't
It's bad for me, I do
Purple cough prevent fluid
Outta time and I knew it
Froze before I got to it
Action timeless get to it
I'm from the dash but you knew it
I'm the wrong nigga to bring home
Ima fall asleep at the dinner table
I'm the wrong nigga to lean on
I know it look as such but I'm not stable

[Outro]
I can't politic with children
I chewed a million milligrams
Aye, aye, aye, woah
