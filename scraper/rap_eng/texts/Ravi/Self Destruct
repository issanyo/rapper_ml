[Hook: HateSonny]
I could never tell you what I do
Don't know why you love me don’t know what I do to you
Taught her to finesse there ain't a nigga she can't fool
Baby bottle Karo serve it to the private school
See him gotta get him, that's the gang way
Can't you tell I hate myself it’s what my name say
Percs up in my drink on the escape way
I might self destruct i'm headed to the gateway

[Verse 1: HateSonny]
What you need
I might double cup the drink so I can sleep
Only one I need with me is motherfuckin' me
Got a bitch who really down to die for me
No one in this life would ever dare to slide on me
Only roll with niggas who is down to ride with me
Only fuck with bitches who gon hold it down for me
Only work with niggas who is bout they fuckin' green
Only move with niggas who can keep up with my speed
Bitch i'm glowing yeah, and shit don’t resonate with me
Back to demon season but these demons taking me
All that shit is frauding all that faking you can keep
Boot unlock the door no we don't' need no fuckin' key
I be geeking, yes I cheat, i'm fiending to finesse
I'm not for the games, i'm not a nigga you should test
All I know is stress it go away when off the tech
Claiming you the gang and that's why niggas getting checked
All i need is checks, don't give a fuck about a friend
Hear these voices screaming telling me i'm not my best
He was talking shit and now his head is popping Pez
Laughing in my head because she say this til the end

[Hook: HateSonny]
I could never tell you what I do
Don't know why you love me don’t know what I do to you
Taught her to finesse there ain't a nigga she can't fool
Baby bottle Karo serve it to the private school
See him gotta get him, that's the gang way
Can't you tell I hate myself it’s what my name say
Percs up in my drink on the escape way
I might self destruct i'm headed to the gateway

[Verse 2: MarquesIsDead]
Self destruct, self destruct
Living dead, fuck my life self destruct
Niggas love to talk pistol tucked shut ya up
And i’m popping drugs, gotta watch how I walk
Shorty wanna fuck cause I walk like the shit
And this life is terrible sometimes, but that’s it
You can’t even find me i’m chilling on my own
Demons in my head i’m just tryna let em roam
Just a little test, after that I send her home
Think i need some meds counting licks up in my phone
Self destruct, self destruct
Heard enough of all your lies
Self destruct
She can’t love me, but she try
Self destruct
This ain’t love
This is lust
Self destruct, self destruct
When i’m too deep in the scene
Self destruct
When you need something from me
Keep it blunt
I don't bluff
I self destruct
