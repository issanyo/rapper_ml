[Verse 1: Sadkidangel]
Red eyes
Chakra flow you can't control
Yellow snake n purple goats
Magic wrote that on my notes
Feel it from my finger tips
Kickin’ shit I can't permit
I just want 100 million dollars n a bad bitch
Then she me left all alone
Start to feel good by myself
Y'all just worried bout some pics
Taking chances for my wealth
I just found another bitch
She just wanna hold my hand
Then she find another man
Something I don’t understand

[Refrain]:
Stop this nonsense I'm goin' home
She feels distant Time moving slow
Heart is breaking fuck x and o's
Don't eat bacon fuck vegan hoes
Don't eat bacon fuck vegan hoes

[Verse 2: Crooks]
Sick of all the shit these niggas say they is lame to me
Fuck all lies these bitches tell they all the same to me
I'm not the one to test yet these niggas play with me
Life it ain't no joke yet they playing games with me
Uh
Uh
Shit it feel like movie
Extended clips in my Ksubis
My bitch she bad and she boujee
Slicing through checks sushi
That nigga lame he goofy
Your bitch wiping me down
Now she wan do me
Now she wan screw me
Bitch!
