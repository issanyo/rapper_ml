That bitch fucked me up
That bitch got me sad

That bitch like a migraine
She won't leave my brain
Shorty came with a price and i paid
Eyes drought it just won't rain
All these pills can't feel no pain
"they finna kill you" so show me my grave
Gone like the wind zone out for the day
I need these bitches i need an escape
Shorty inconsistent she shifting like shapes
Popping prescriptions i'm leaving this place
Break all the pictures glass cut up my face
Angel in the snow
Footprints prada lows
Acne pants with rag and bone
I don't trust a soul
I don't trust a soul

Sleepless nights too frequent
Don't know why she leaving
Early start perc season
Bitch i didn't need this
Gave you all i could
I don't trust a soul
These pills don't stop the pain
Trying my best to replace you
Love you but i hate you
Living with regret i'm ashamed too
I can't even face you
Left me for some lame dude
Bitch i swear i hate you
