You told me all your thoughts
Let me tell you how i feel now
And i ain't gonna lie no
Imma keep it real right now
You wonder why you always see me
Wonder why ive never seen you
Well baby it ain't you
Ive been in the lew yea
Im in a different city
I tell you that im bizzy
And all you do is call
I tell you that i miss you
Like i wanna get witchu
But im so far
Facetime you makin faces at me
So i smile to try to make you happy
But i know how you feel
And i know that

All you ever say is
Come and see me for once (2x)
You dont ever come to me
Yea
Cuz all she ever say is
Come and see me for once (2x)
You dont ever come to me

[Pnb Rock]

You dont ever come to me

I already know (2x)
Watchu finna say, yea
How ya attitude gon be when i pick up the phone
You ain't trynna hear my excuses
You said every one of them is stupid
And i already know how you feel
But i still let you down
When you so fuckin trill
Yea you so fuckin real
And i know that
You said everytime you see me
Why i always gotta be wit my peeps
Like why it always gotta be twenty deep
Like why can't it ever just be you and me ohh
You never been in my wheel
Its always ubers and shit
You never been in my crib
Its always hotels wit the kid
You just wanna go on a date
For me to pick the time and the place
I apologize for the way
For the way i barely come around

All you say is
Come and see me for once (2x)
You dont ever come to me (2x)
All you ever say is
Come and see me for once (2x)
You dont ever come to me (2x)
Yea
