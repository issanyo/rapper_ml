[Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread, it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
And every other week he getting visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead

[Verse 1]
State correction institution, I just left a visit
Seen my nigga, he stressed out, so I just sat and listened
Been only down a couple years
He said the streets don't miss him
And he was just the man out there, he said he don't get it
Outta sight, outta mind
That's just it, bottom line
You see who fuck with you
And who love you when you doing time
Said his homie snitched and signed
His name up on that dotted line
Told them people everything
Shed no tears and dropped the dime
Plus he just found out his lil bro got hit 11 times
Shot him in his face, all in his head right in front of they mom
All this shit is going down, he in a cell losing his mind
Ain't even wanna mention all the shit about his baby moms
She don't send no bread, It's fucking with his head
And just the other day she said she moving with the kids
She found a different nigga, different city with some bread
Said they moving to his crib, she left my nigga sick

[Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread and it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
And every other week he getting visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead

[Verse 2]
I told my nigga hold his head, it's cool yeah he gon' make it
5 times a day, Salah and just keep on praying
He waiting on that appeal, I told him just be patient
Everything don't happen overnight bro, I'm just saying
My dog stressin' everyday he wake up
Cause the feds steady tryna build a case up
He was flippin' bricks and getting to that paper
But had to smoke a nigga cause he tried to take some
A nigga tried to rob his man for a couple bands
His crazy cousin man, the one who took the stand
And got my nigga life inside the fucking can
When he did that shit just for him and I don't understand

[Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread and it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
Just the other day he got some visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead
