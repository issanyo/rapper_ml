[Intro]
Got it on smash

[Verse 1: Skinnyfromthe9 & PnB Rock]
Tattoos on my body, it's okay, I got a lot
Niggas keep on hatin', it's okay, I count my guap
I just copped a chain, twenty thousand, what it cost
All my diamonds wet, they been drippin' like some Voss
Like ohh, look how they talk to me, diamonds, they dancin'
Shawty be stalkin' me, she said that I'm handsome
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up to the mansion
I want you on top of me like a fraction
I was broke a couple years ago and now I'm rich
See me shinin' I got diamonds, I'ma prolly fuck yo' bitch
I just pull up in a foreign, I'ma go and drop the top
That bitch way too borin', I don't want her, she a thot

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
Ohh, I just jumped out that Porsche
Ohh, I been flexin' like a sport
I'm not lyin', if you ride with me, we could chill tonight
It's a vibe, I'm not wastin' time, girl you just my type
Ohh, I just jumped out that Porsche
Ohh, I been flexin' like a sport
I'm not lyin', if you ride with me, we could chill tonight
It's a vibe, I'm not wastin' time, girl you just my type

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Like ohh, I just jumped off some shit
Ohh, I just pulled up with your B
I'm not lyin', you was on her line, she was suckin' dick
Diamonds shine, just like summertime, bitch look at my wrist
Ice, ice baby, huh, brand new Mercedes, huh
I just took your lady, huh, ready to eat my babies, huh
Damn shawty, she a freak, she bustin' up these sheets
Damn, shawty love to eat, suddenly who was a geek
Wondered if I was PnB, cause she know I'm from the streets
Like ohh, they be tryna find a way
Ohh, get the fuck up out my face
Pussy boy, I need my space, then you tryna take my chain
He must wanna get shot today, must wanna meet 2Pac today

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
Ohh, I just jumped out that Porsche
Ohh, I been flexin' like a sport
I'm not lyin', if you ride with me, we could chill tonight
It's a vibe, I'm not wastin' time, girl you just my type
Ohh, I just jumped out that Porsche
Ohh, I been flexin' like a sport
I'm not lyin', if you ride with me, we could chill tonight
It's a vibe, I'm not wastin' time, girl you just my type
