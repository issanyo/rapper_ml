[Intro: PnB Rock & PnB Deezie]
Oh yeah
Rock
Yeah

[Verse 1: PnB Deezie]
She can get it all night, ain't even gotta ask
Titties is small but she work with a lot of ass
She just hop on this bull and it start riding fast
If I bang out in minutes I ain't got no time to crash
I'm right up in them thighs, bust it open from the side
We fuck for sixty minutes, then we sixty-nine
A shower and some sour, I think it's 'bout that hour
She don't work at a kennel but keep bad bitches around her, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You ain't got to be alone tonight
Shawty you can call my phone tonight
Said you had a long day, I come over to your place
Put a smile on your face, baby you gon' get it all night long
That's right, you ain't gotta be alone tonight
I know you want smoke, shawty I can bring the dope
Baby you already know, that you can get it all night long
All night, can get it all night long
All night, I'ma hit it all night long
All night, can get it all night long
We gon' do it all night long
All night, I'ma fuck you all night long
All night, have you screamin' all night long
All night, gon' do it all night long
We gon' do it all night long

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Stop stalling me
On some R. Kelly shit, your body calling me
Know you hate being alone, just call on my phone
I can come over and you can put it all on me, ayy
Girl you sexy and you know it
Your body is art, don't be scared to show it
When you fucking with a real nigga
Shawty I'm real nigga, I know how to deal with ya
So girl just get naked
I done been patient enough
Fuckin' with a real nigga, why you think I'm still with ya
I know how to deal with ya

[Verse 2: PnB Deezie]
We finna roll up, kill all the hold ups
I make her run to get the Magnum, she say load up
Yeah, facts only, I fuck with her
Keep shit real, she stay true
Cake like it's her date of birth, I love her in her B-day suit
She hate bein' alone, she need me in the zone
I think Medusa starin' at us 'cause we gettin' stoned
Let's smoke it 'til it's gone, give me Henny, fuck Patron
She say go and cut the lights off, I'ma turn you on
Yeah I know that she a liar
Oh yeah, I'm 'bout to dive in
Soaking wet pussy, shawty got me slippin' slidin'
She say you ain't got a chick daddy, she just want his dick badly
Nike marathon, we just do it all night long

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You ain't got to be alone tonight
Shawty you can call my phone tonight
Said you had a long day, I come over to your place
Put a smile on your face, baby you gon' get it all night long
That's right, you ain't gotta be alone tonight
I know you want smoke, shawty I can bring the dope
Baby you already know, that you can get it all night long
All night, can get it all night long
All night, I'ma hit it all night long
All night, can get it all night long
We gon' do it all night long
All night, I'ma fuck you all night long
All night, have you screamin' all night long
All night, gon' do it all night long
We gon' do it all night long
