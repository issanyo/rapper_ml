[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me

[Verse 1: PnB Chizz]
I got me, can't no bitch say that
I ain't on nobody roster, they can't bench me scraps
'Cause I'm a free agent, no there ain't no salary cap
I trap the graveyard shift, I stay where vamps lay at
All these lost souls fishin' to listen to that new soul tape
If you apply pressure I promise you that I won't break
I seen it at sixteen, told 'em that they was gon' hate
I was preachin' the future yet wondering what it's gon' take
But I get it, I get it, I finally see it y'all
They don't have dreams so how they supposed to believe in ours
I kept on changing my name 'cause I knew my soul was lost
But look I found it, ayy let me introduce you to John
We gon' make it out Rock, godspeed
It's gon' take a lil patience but it's godspeed
That's the only person I can say that I need
Ain't nobody else who got me like I got me

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
It took a while for me just to get it
Like what my songs ain't good enough? what they ain't fuckin' wit' it?
I'm just asking for support, what that's too much for niggas?
That loyalty word ain't no joke, that shit'll have you trippin'
Like can you be loyal to niggas that done changed on you?
And do for niggas that won't even do the same for you?
You outside while they chilling in the house
Watching TV on the couch, like fuck it, lettin' it rain on you
Don't understand niggas, I don't understand
Spend money on a bitch but you won't spend it on your man, I know
Yeah I get it my nigga, you got a job
I just find it crazy, smokers pay for my studio time
Yet you always in my sessions screaming, "Rock, turn up"
You just waiting for a check as soon as Rock blow up
I wrote this song so you could never say I never told you
We're finished turning up, I'm turning over

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me
