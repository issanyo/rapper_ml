[Ebenezer : Verse 1]
I ain't like them other niggas i'm from London
North Side's where we come from
I ain't really bout that beef shit
But chef niggas if they want some
You keep giving niggas second chances
Play with fire with the devil dancing
You just gotta understand this
They're just gonna take advantage
I ain't saying i'm a saint cause I ain't though
I was fuckin' bitches, I ain't got a halo
Simon says, make yuh bitch do what i say so
Huh like i got his bitch on payroll
The world, if i have a daughter
It's not what i woulda taught her
Wouldn't tell her buss it wide
Put 9 inches in a quarter
I would make that nigga take her to the Altar

[Chorus]
No No
Do not let them other niggas know know
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché
Do not let them other niggas know know
Do not let them other niggas know know
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché
But I
Real one, real one
Pop pop pop it for a real one
A real one
Yeah a real one, a real one
Pop pop pop girl I
I'm a real one

[PNB Rock : Verse 2]
I ain't like these other niggas i'm from Philly
All my real niggas feel me
Came out the mud, yeah i was filthy (yeah)
I'm just giving y'all the real me
Limousine tints on a ride, so they can't see in
That's cause i'm just not any one
I can't just drive by, they might box me in
When i slide by, I be blending in
And you know i'm a real one
I'm gon' die a real one
And I ain't like these other niggas last last
And I would rather show u with my last chance

[Ebenezer & Pnb Rock : Chorus]
No No (no)
Do not let them other niggas know know (Know)
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché (cliché)
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché (cliché)
Do not let them other niggas know know (know)
Do not let them other niggas know know (know)
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché (cliché)
I know that when you hear it, it sounds cliché (cliché)
But I
Real one, real one
Pop pop pop it for a real one
A real one
Yeah a real one, a real one
Pop pop pop girl I
I'm a real one (oh)
Yeah
