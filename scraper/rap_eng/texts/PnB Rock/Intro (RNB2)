I got rappers sick of me
'Cause the way im switching flows (Woo)
Off one hook I go to Neimans like give me that give me those
Shot out to my momma tho'
She just got through surgery
I know shit is fucked up
Lately she ain't heard from me (Woo)
She don't understand

Get us all out the hood
For she have to bury me
Shit is gettin' realer now (Real)
My daughter gettin' bigger now (Real)
Most the time I'm on the road
I'm wishing I was wit' her now (For real)
Thinking about my old bitch
I know that bitch see me now (Woo)
But all of these new bitches helpin me forget her now
Man I swear I can't wait till we get rich
'Til all of my niggas pull up in some shit (Woo)
And all of my folks got money in different bank accounts
For them and all of their kids
