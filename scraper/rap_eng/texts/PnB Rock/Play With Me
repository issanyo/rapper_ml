[Hook: PnB Rock]
Boy don't try your luck tonight
Cause man, I got my gang with me
And we got them choppas, ain't no fightin'
They gon' bang with me
Buncha real hittas, they'll even take the case with me
I ain't like these other rappers
Pussy don't you play with me
Boy don't try your luck tonight
Cause man, I got my gang with me
And we got them choppas, ain't no fightin'
They gon' bang with me
Buncha real hittas, they'll even take the case with me
I ain't like these other rappers
Pussy don't you play with me

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Four niggas in a stolen whip
Lotta guns and a lotta clips
Bout to slide thru a nigga's strip
Cause he did some things that I can't forget
Home ride, ain't no rappin'
No music just lowin' rachets
Only thing on my nigga's mind
Is murder, death, and someone snitchin'
Bout to park up on the strip
Booty all up on my hip
Walk down, no drive-by's
Gotta make sure this pussy get hit
Make sure the burner has clips
Pop like a punk then I dip
It ain't over, had to spend it, bend it
Hit up every witness I missed
That's just how I really could get it
That's just how I really could get it
I smoke me some dope, I sip me some lean
And think about killin' some shit
I pick up the choppa, the clip a banana
I'm thinkin' bout pullin' some shit
Let it spray, its gon' hit what it hit
Better watch what you say out your lips

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Pussy don't you play with me
Bitch that choppa stay with me
AK, in her 36, so y'all gon get 18 a piece
Bitch I'm stand up, droppin' brains in the passenger seat
Bitch I'm flamed up, red rags, I got that gang with me
Bitch I'm from the east
Where they'll murk you for a quarter piece
Say you want protection, nigga, gotta charge your ass a fee
And I ride 'round with that .223 on my passenger seat
Two more shootas in the back so that's like two more .223's
Fuck the lollygaggin' and the talkin', all I know is 3's
Bleh, bleh, bleh, fuck nigga, all I know is bleed
I be gettin' paranoid when I'm smokin' on that weed
I feel like I'm 2Pac, or somebody watchin' me
