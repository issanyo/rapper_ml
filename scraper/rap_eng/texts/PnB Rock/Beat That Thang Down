[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, yeah
Ohh, mmh
Ohh, oh yeah

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
No make up on, in her pink panties
I'ma beat that thang down, baby don't panic
Smelling cookies and cologne, she get so nasty
Can I hit it, she say baby you don't gotta ask me
Just don't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody
Would you suck it if I eat it on the seat, we Posturepedic
Can I hit you on the camera while you watch it on my TV?
Would you love me if I fuck you 'til you're numb
Soon as I arrive, I make you cum
'Fore we leave I make her run
I'm a nigga from the slums
No mixtape, burn with the drum
I won't give a basic bitch no crumbs
If I met you in the projects would you set me up?
Let them people know I'm 'round you just to wet me up
She like nigga be for real, they won't mess with us
You took me to the telly, put this on and F it up
Project music got her shaking all that ass
She wanna fuck but she don't know if I got cash yet
She sent the number but she never sent the address
The total package like it's squeeze and then she access

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
You should let a real nigga beat that thang down
I be busy getting rich, yeah I don't hang out
You won't meet another nigga with the same style
I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
You should let a real nigga beat that thang down
I be busy getting rich, I don't hang out
You won't meet another nigga with the same style
I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
Ooh, ooh, I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
Ooh, ooh, I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
You should let a real nigga beat that thang down

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
You should come through and let me put my thang on it
I'ma fuck around and make you tat my name on you
All them other niggas, they don't do the same for you
You know me, I don't play no games with you
Put that shit all on my face
I love the way that you taste
I ain't got no time, I can't waste
I just wanna fuck you in my Wraith
Shawty let me fuck you in my Benz too
Fuck it girl, you should bring your friends too
Let me show you what I get into
Let me show you what I'm into
Grip on your neck when I hit from the back
I'm going crazy, I'm pullin' on tracks
I'm off of perky, I hope you can last
Go'n on on, baby go'n on on
But we ain't on no makin' love shit
We can get high, catch a vibe, I got drugs, yeah
We can get high, catch a vibe, no cuffing
We can get high, catch a vibe, only thug shit

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
You should let a real nigga beat that thang down
I be busy getting rich, yeah I don't hang out
You won't meet another nigga with the same style
I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
You should let a real nigga beat that thang down
I be busy getting rich, I don't hang out
You won't meet another nigga with the same style
I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, I'm a beast on these beats and I'm banged out
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, you should let a real nigga beat that thang

[Outro: PnB Rock]
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you should let a real nigga beat that thang down
