When i met you
You was wit ya crew
You had all the sauce
You had all the juice
Got your number that same night
I end up callin you
You said you would call me back
Becuz the trap was callin you
Thats when i fell in love
Cuz my shawty sellin drugs
She got her own work
She got her own plug
She got her own crib
She ain't got no kids
My lil shawty racked up
She ain't on no broke shit
Im glad that i found her forreal
So glad that i found her forreal
And when i be out of town
I be wishin im around her forreal
Everytime we're together its a movie
You dont care about nun of my groupies
Sometimes i think like why did you choose me
Now you got me girl, you ain't gonna loose me
Oh yea
