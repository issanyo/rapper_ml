[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy when I was a lil boy my mama told me when it rains it pours and niggas get wet, you know what I'm sayin'
But I went out there in that rain anyways
Now I acknowledge all my niggas who went out there with me no one bothered

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Kodak Black]
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
(Hoo, we done went through the mud)
Been through it all, them blood sweat and tears my niggas
And through it all they always kept it real my niggas (that's love)
They would always hold me down 'cause they my day ones (ayy)
Fuck a right or wrong, they been around since day one
Still ridin' round and gettin' it with my day ones (my brothers)
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga? (who'd of ever knew?)
I done made it out the mud with my day ones

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I done seen everything but the wind blow
So much losses, who thought I would ever win though
I don't fuck with nigga's shit but I gived on him
So if he hating he can't say I never did for him
You already got the devil playing games on you
Quick to say I changed if I don't pick the dang phone up
And I don't care how good you can rap or sing
It ain't easy when you tryna sign to Sniper Gang
Had to hustle and to struggle, it be thundering
It's a storm every day out my window pane
Mama said when lightning strike it ain't got no name
The streets dragged me through the mud, fuckin' with that rain

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
Been through it all, them blood sweat and tears my niggas
And through it all they always kept it real my niggas
They would always hold me down 'cause they my day ones
Fuck a right or wrong, they been around since day one
Still ridin' round and gettin' it with my day ones
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
I done made it out the mud with my day ones

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
All the dirt I did, who'd of ever thought?
That god would still bless me unless he forgot about
We was hittin' all them stores, kickin' in your house
Most my niggas gone, some of us ain't get caught
Every nigga 'round me got a fucked up history
Me, Maino, Blood, and Pistol Pete dodged sentences
'Cause they your day ones don't mean they legitimate
I known this nigga for a minute, he ready to kill for me
Mane niggas can't believe how the fuck you did this shit
Why god put you in position and not them in it?
Wasn't envious when I was waitin' on licks to hit
I pray them ain't your real feelings, it's the devil trickin' it
I know it's still love in your heart if you're diggin' it
I still care about you even if you never hear from me
But I done got so damn cold, feel my heart shivering
God forgiving this, but why do got keep forgiving me?

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
Been through it all, them blood sweat and tears my niggas
And through it all they always kept it real my niggas
They would always hold me down 'cause they my day ones
Fuck a right or wrong, they been around since day one
Still ridin' round and gettin' it with my day ones
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
I done made it out the mud with my day ones

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Remember ridin' fifty deep at G with you niggas
I'm on a different page, started reading you niggas
If I ain't by myself I'm with two or three niggas
I'm layin' on the prayer but I ain't talkin' to Jesus
Blood sweat tears and revenge
I ain't shed no tears ever since
My niggas died and I tried for my friends
I wanted to cry but I can't
You came asking 'bout me 'fore you got hit
We talked a day ago before the shit
I was locked up in a predicament
My cousin got hit up with a coincidence
If I wasn't doin' a bid I would've slid
But I ain't worried 'cause he got a vent
Every situation we gon' handle it
But I wanted to cry, wanted to vent

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
Been through it all, them blood sweat and tears my niggas
And through it all they always kept it real my niggas
They would always hold me down 'cause they my day ones
Fuck a right or wrong, they been around since day one
Still ridin' round and gettin' it with my day ones
Who'd think we'd ever make it here my nigga?
I done made it out the mud with my day ones

[Outro: Kodak Black]
Man who would've ever thought, you know what I'm sayin'
Like this shit be so shocking, a nigga be appalled, you know what I'm sayin'
You can do evil things but
Have a good reason behind doing your evil
You know what I'm sayin', that don't mean you a demon for it, 'cause you doin' evil
I want to thank all my niggas, you know what I'm sayin'
No frontin', they believed in me, they trust
Sniper Gang
Yeah all my niggas in the chain gang got cell phones
