[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ride around wit' it (Huh), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Bad bitch, yeah she too thick
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it (Gang)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
I ride around wit' it (Skrt skrt), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Broke bitch keep your two cents
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I ride around with a .30
Woke up to you, hit that dirty
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' murk me
These niggas know they can't hurt me
'Cause I ride around wit' it
You know I keep a stick (Huh)
I ain't got time for this
Put that on my mom and shit (Huh)
Niggas gon' hate, that's regardless
See a lil' young nigga ballin'
I've been runnin' 'round in a foreign (Swish)
Fuck a lil' bitch, she was boring
I ride around wit' it, you know I keep a stick (Yeah)
These niggas broke and shit (Yeah)
Ain't got no hoes or shit (Yeah)
I ride around wit' my stick
Chop up that shit and go bleh, bleh
You don't want woe wit' the clique (Gang)
Play with the gang, you get hit (Gang)
'Cause I ride around wit' it
Know I got rounds and shit
I be gunnin' you down and shit (Grrr)
Don't play around and shit
'Cause I ride round wit' it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ride around wit' it (Huh), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Bad bitch, yeah she too thick
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it (Gang)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
I ride around wit' it (Skrt skrt), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Broke bitch keep your two cents (Bitch)
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby, I ride around wit' my glizzy
These niggas know me, they be all in my business
They always hatin, they ain't seein' my vision
Designer on me, when I step out I'm drippin(Drip)
I ride around wit' it
Back pack, hold a cool quarter million
I'm doin' better, now they all in their feelings
Cut 'em off, I don't want no more dealin's
MG when I'm ceilin', Aderall got me trippin'
Bad bitch wit' no children
See what I do and then try ride my wave
They weant my treasure, repeat what I say
All this money goin' wit' me to the grave
Balenciaga, I don't want the new J's
Found a plug and then I started gettin' paid
Jumped in the game, took over the game
You better not mention my name
That shit won't get you no fame
Tellin' lies nigga, hate they be lyin'
Catchin' bodies, put your pick in a frame
I got all mad about my bitch in a Range
I'm bouta read to you, it's not in my veins
I ride around wit' it
Two sticks on the back seat
Screamin' now that they won't be
Got some young niggas who can't wait to eat
They waitin [?]

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ride around wit' it (Aye), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Bad bitch, yeah she too thick
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it (Gang)
I ride around wit' it, I ride around wit' it
I ride around wit' it (Skrt skrt), I ride around wit' it (Yuh)
Skrt skrt in the new whip
Broke bitch keep your two cents
Gang gang, yeah we too lit
I ride around wit' it
