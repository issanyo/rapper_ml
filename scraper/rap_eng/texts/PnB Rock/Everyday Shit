[Hook: PnB Rock]x2
Down from the trenches where we stay in some shit
So you better watch what you say out your lips
30 do you dirty, I stay with the grip
Plus I got a mini AK in the whip
Youngins in the field everyday with the shits
Niggas get killed every day where we live
I just dropped another 50K on my wrist
You ain’t taking shit from me, it’s gon stay on my wrist
Down from the trenches where we stay in some shit
So you better watch what you say out your lips
30 do you dirty, I stay with the grip
Plus I got a mini AK in the whip
Youngins in the field everyday with the shits
Niggas get killed every day where we live
I just dropped another 50K on my wrist
You ain’t taking shit from me, it’s gon stay on my wrist

[Verse 1: Jack Boy]
Still with the shits, still in the mix
Still hitting' licks, still takin' trips
Riding with the choppa on my biker gang shit
Remember back then when I ain’t have shit
Bad ass jit, put the jump in your waist
Screech off with the shit
Take off with your shit, cash out, invest in the zip
Tryna make a flip, serving it so legit
Tool on my hip, I’m too hip to the shit
To be filthy rich, niggas put you in a ditch
Banana clip, boy don't get your shit split
Stop watching me, suggest you watch your bitch
Told her give me motion, give me no lip
I could act a ass, baby girl I’m the shit
Younging masked up on some every day shit
Dressed in all black, that's some everyday shit
On probation, still tote 30 clips
Rather get caught with it than get caught without it
Imma save the bread up 'till it start to rot
Had to get a safe shoe box full of knots
Tryna make it out, Just tryna make it out
Road to riches, younging finally on route
Youngin finally on route

[Verse 2: Jack Boy]
My niggas, my brothers, same block, different mothers
Went through the same struggle, we all had to hustle
You from the suburbs, I’m from the jungle
No time to fumble, I’m tryna bubble
