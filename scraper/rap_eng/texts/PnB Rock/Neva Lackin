Skrt, skrt, skrt
Brizzy on that beat
Uh, [?], yuh, yuh, yuh, yeah

[Chorus]
Ay, word on the street they gon' kill me, still ain't happened (Bitch)
Ridin' wit' my pole, bitch I swear I'm never lackin'
Still doin' show in my city, gotta get my bag in
They say that they lookin' for me, we know that they cappin' (Bitch)
I've been trappin' (Bitch)
Niggas keep thinkin' this shit a joke, my niggas ain't laughin' (Uhh)
Niggas keep actin' like they want smoke, bitch turned to ashes
(Boo, boo, boo)
Get the drop, fuck 12, don't know what happened (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
Girl they done fuck up and love me, get some change
I swear they done fuck up and love me in the game
Iced out all my chains and put some diamonds in my rings
I just bought a new Glizzy and that bitch came wit' a brain (Brrt, brrt)

Fuck 12, ain't scared (Scared)
Put a price on your head (Yeah)

I put diamonds on my wrist and now they hatin' (Ice, ice)
Put some diamonds on my bitch, now she so wavy (Ice)
Bitch, I'm ballin' and I'm shootin', I feel like KD (Ballin')
I like beef and I mix that shit wit' gravy (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
Shout out "No love" in the streets 'cause that's who raised me (Raised me)
See a nigga get show, raw dead, that shit amaze me (Brrt, bow)
All these hunnids bustin' out the wrapper, that's that blue cheese (that's them blue cheese)
Niggas be rappin', niggas be cappin' like they gon' shoot me

[Chorus]
Ay, word on the street they gon' kill me, still ain't happened (Bitch)
Ridin' wit' my pole, bitch I swear I'm never lackin' (Yuh)
Still doin' shows in my city, gotta get my Birkin (Doin' shows, yuh)
They say that they lookin' for me, we know that they cappin' (What you doin'?)

Posted on a block, bitch, from Sunday to Sunday
Told myself "I know imma be rich one day" (Yuh)
Huh, like what are you sayin'? (What are you sayin')
Huh, thought you was my mans
See you crossed the line and you stabbed me in my back, that was all in your plans, huh (Plans, huh)
Or you turned to a opp, gave up that drop, tryna get a nigga jammed, huh (Jammed)
Man that shit don't add up (It don't add up)

If you fuck wit' my paper, then that's gon' leave you dead (That's gon' leave you dead)
They gon' find you in a truck wit' a bullet in your head (Bullet in your head)
Wit' a note in your pocket that say "I fucked up his bread", bitch ("I fucked up his bread")
Huh, and you already know (Yuh)
Niggas don't want smoke (Don't want smoke)
Bitch it's new lane and that's the gang, gimme your gold (New lane, new lane)

Ain't no swervin' me (Swerve)
Ain't no surgery (Surge)
Murderin' first degree

[Chorus]
Ay, word on the street they gon' kill me, still ain't happened (Word, yeah)
Ridin' wit' my pole, bitch I swear I'm never lackin' (Yuh)
