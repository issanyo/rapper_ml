[Verse 1]
Fuck these hoes, I just hit ‘em then I flee ‘em
‘Cause I know hoes fuckin’ for some lime-a-ritas
Think I’m cuffing, you don’t know me ho
Yeah we can chill, and we can fuck, and we can smoke this dope
Other than that, you don’t get nothin’ but a lil conversation
‘Cause we cool but we ain’t that cool
Bitch I ain’t really got no patience
For no ho shit
Learned that back in oh-six
Fell in love, I went to jail
She ain’t hold me down, I was so sick
Nowadays I been in the trap, gettin’ them racks
Watch ‘cause the cops kickin’ doors down
And made money, the bitch she ain’t been on my mind
‘cause I ain’t really worried ‘bout no hoes now
Lately I been over there in mix
Stayin’ down, tryna get a brick
Stayin’ strapped with my four pound
Nigga just said he got a lick
Say he know the boy with the shit
Hell yeah I’m on go now
I’m rappin’, I’m trappin’, I’m singin’, I’m smashin’, your girl wanna have me (that’s her)
I hit my plug like I’m ready and he come at me with the package (that work)
I’m smokin’, I’m drinkin’, I’m leanin’, but don’t ever think that I’m lackin’ (hell nah)
Here go the answers to all of the questions I know you gon’ ask me (ask me)

[Chorus]
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’

[Verse 2]
Niggas actin’ like they trappin’, they be fraudin’
Never sold no crack, on tracks like I got hard an’
I bet that you don’t even know a plug
Faking for these bum bitches, man we know what’s up
Niggas do anything for a buzz now
See it’s cool to act like you sell drugs now
‘til you really in the field and a nigga get killed
Now you point your fingers, tellin’ to the judge now
You a rat in the hood, no thug now
In the club they don’t show you no love now
Bum bitches ain’t tryna let you fuck now
Nigga shoulda stayed in your lane, you on the bus now
Ho shit, I ain’t never on no ho shit
I’m a real nigga, I be on my dope shit
Trap star, got it tatted on my knuckles nigga
All I know is hustle, I’ll never trust no bitch
I swear I’ll never change on my niggas
No matter what, I’ll be the same with my niggas
Keep gettin’ all this fuckin’ change on my niggas
I don’t give a fuck if it ain’t ‘bout my niggas

[Chorus]
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’
