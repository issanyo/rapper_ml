[Verse 1]
Baby you can leave, you can leave, you can leave
Cause I been tired of you, girl and you tired of me
But that's only for the moment, you ain't going nowhere
We done been through way too much girl just to throw it all away
But baby you can leave, you can leave, you can leave
Cause we need time to breathe, time to breathe, time to breathe
Feel like that's the only way it can be, you with me yeah
Think we need a new start
Shit been going too far

We can make it last but right now we're both just mad
