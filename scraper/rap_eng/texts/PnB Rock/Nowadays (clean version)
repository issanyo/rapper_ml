Used to sleep in the crib, no heat on
Put some crates under the bed, just to sleep on
Put some syrup on my bread, just to eat on
Nowadays, look at boys, we on
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I had to boss my life up
Get my change up, had to get my ice up
Get my bands up, had to get my mans up
For the block, yeah I do it for my fam, yeah

[Verse 1]
Here's a little story bout a boy named PnB
Know a couple boy thinking bout deleting me
I don't give a though, cause I keep that thing with me
When them boys run into me, keep that same energy
Came from a broken home, momma, she was never home
All our fathers dead and gone, yeah they left us all alone
Momma had to sell stuff, 'member boys took her pack
Robbed her for a sack, now we gotta start from scratch
In and out of shelters, felt like God failed us
All these family members, ain't nobody help us
It don't even matter though, we gone be rich one day
'Til then I'm on the block, trappin' up a one-way
Boys talking crazy they don't want no gun play
I'll pull up on that boy block, on a Sunday
Church day, I'll turn that stuff into a hearse day
Every time you see me, I be riding with my 30
Every time you see me, I be slidin' with my 30
Give a opp a 42, feel like James Worthy
Leave a boy brains on the side, where the curb be
Leave a boy name on his shirt, like a jersey
Opp stuff, yeah we pop, like a perky
Opp's talking all that hot but still ain't hurt me
Boys disrespect my brother name we gone murk 'em
Slide through they block, we gone do them boys dirty (yeah)

[Chorus]
Used to sleep in the crib, no heat on (yeah)
Put some crates under the bed, just to sleep on (yeah)
Put some syrup on my bread, just to eat on (yeah)
Nowadays, look at boys, we on (yeah)
Nowadays, look at boys, we up (yeah)
Still ain't comfortable so I ain't got my feet up (yeah)
Trap phone jumpin' off the meter (yeah)
I need 50K for a feature (yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I had to boss my life up (boss my life up)
Get my change up, had to get my ice up (ice)
Get my bands up, had to get my mans up (get my mans up)
For the block, yeah I do it for my fam (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Do it for the block, can't just do it for my gang (gang)
Do it for the squad, yeah you know it's New Lane (skrt)
Forget all these other boys, oh they so lame
Forget all these rap boys
I'll take one of they chain (gimme that stuff)
Cause they sweet, yeah them boys girls
They don't want no smoke
I'll pull up to they show with all my bro's, with all these poles
Like what's happening?
We can get it cracking, we can get it popping
We gone get them boys up then we gone run all in they pocket
Cause they sweet, yeah them boys hoes, told you before
I ain't nothing like these boys that be singing to these hoes
Cause I be singing and I be trappin and I be riding round with my pole
All these lames gone get exposed, I just get it with my girls

[Chorus]
Used to sleep in the crib, no heat on (with no heat on)
Put some crates under the bed, just to sleep on
Put some syrup on my bread, just to eat on (just to eat on)
Nowadays, look at boys, we on (yeah)
Nowadays, look at boys, we up (yeah)
Still ain't comfortable so I ain't got my feet up (yeah)
Trap phone jumpin' off the meter (yeah)
I need 50K for a feature (yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah I had to boss my life up
Get my change up, had to get my ice up
Get my bands up, had to get my mans up
For the block, yeah I do it for my fam, yeah
