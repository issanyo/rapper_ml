[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Nigga if you came from the hood
Then you probably gon' stay in the hood
Niggas get killed every single day in the hood
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Niggas sellin' 'cane in the hood
Smokin' dope, shootin' dice in the hood
Hopin' they don't lose they life in the hood, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kur]
Up top where the chances are slim
Baby moms, no pampers, no milk
I can't cry over milk that been spilt
What's behind doin' so many bills
Hard times, man, I'm talkin' 'bout filth
Low times thinkin' chalkin' and shit
Broke times, 'bout to rob something quick
I can't shine if I'm not on my shit
I'm on the 9 if I'm not at the crib
Where niggas get high, niggas smoke cigs
Where niggas get by and don't wanna give
Where bitches get popped and leave in a Lyft
Outsiders get stopped, like "Who are you with?"
I jumped in the mix, I climbed out the ditch
The dirt, the piss, the hurtful shit
The perc addict, I worked at it
I caught static and didn't change

[Pre-Chorus: Kur]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You could make it through the rain, I made it through the rain

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Nigga if you came from the hood
Then you probably gon' stay in the hood
Niggas get killed every single day in the hood
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Niggas sellin' 'cane in the hood
Smokin' dope, shootin' dice in the hood
Hopin' they don't lose they life in the hood, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kur]
Had a buck penny pinchin'
Moved that stuff, got evicted
Grab a cup, drink from the spigot
I ate crumbs, I was dependent
I just dumped so now I'm itchin'
Ain't each lunch, I'm on a 15
What you want trey-oh's or 15's?
What you want minor or big leagues?
Fuck the script, bitch peel a 16
Fuck the script, I'm on the big screen
Takin' pills was so addicting
In the field that shit was risky
It was night time when the blitzed me
Skimpy dimes what I was pinchin'
Then my shot was about to kick in
Then my block is always with me
And the cops was always spinnin'
And the time just keep on tickin'
Holdin' on, but feel I'm slippin'
Gave a fuck, but all that ended
I just tuck cause they gon' frisk us
'Lot of fuck bitches that dissed me
Niggas scammin' tryna trick me
Niggas jam you put you 6 feet
Bunch of candles, cryin', sniffin'
I was rammin', so defensive
Had to man up, handle business
I was damaged, I was livid

[Pre-Chorus: Kur]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You could make it through the rain, I made it through the rain

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Nigga if you came from the hood
Then you probably gon' stay in the hood
Niggas get killed every single day in the hood
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Niggas sellin' 'cane in the hood
Smokin' dope, shootin' dice in the hood
Hopin' they don't lose they life in the hood, yeah, yeah

[Outro: PnB Rock]
It never shines in the ghetto
It always rains in the hood
Nigga if you came from the hood
Then you probably gon' stay in the hood
Niggas get killed every single day in the hood
It never shines in the ghetto
