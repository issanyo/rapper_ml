[Verse 1: 2 Milly]
It's too many different girls in my bed
Fuckin with my head
Strip clubs fuckin up my bread
Melissa on Monday
Tiffany Tuesday
Wildn out on Wednesday with Wendy in the Jacuzzi
Thirsty Thursdays get 30 bottles of champagne
Sturdy gang we taking over the damn game
Freaky Fridays is fried lobster and Bombay
Steak entrees I'm bumpin that old Sade
Now all I see is Celine bags and red bottoms
Chanel bags and mink coats they all got em
Mac lip gloss they put it on they all poppin

Now slow it down let me show you where my room at
So we can sip 'tron in the zone, you tryna do that?
On the low shawty blow like a pro & I kinda knew that
Got chicks  all kinda chicks  got 2 Milly

[Hook: PNB Rock]

I can't help but fuck up all my bread now

Pockets full of bank roll right now

Too many right now, too many right now, too many right now
If you ain't know then you gon know right now

[Verse 2]
It was Pretty Ali, I met out of Cali
Crazy Karrie kept callin me baby daddy
Too many Dominicans, Indians I be swimming in
And fuck average my bitch is the baddest and
I hope nobody sleeping in mine
Cause I feel like you on the low tryna creep on the side
But I got too many nothing to talk about
Thoughts of being a side nigga ain't workin out
You say you ready to ride now bring the birkins out
Its summertime donâ€™t hide it go head and work it out
And let your friends stack cheddar
I see you twerking now
Then we can go kick it right after I lay these verses down
No rehearsing now we finishing after round 2
Your Friends come around I promise I lay em down too
Got chicks all kinda chicks got too many
Lipstick on my pillow case not 2 Milly
