[Chorus: PnB Rock & YFN Lucci]
I came up from nothing, nigga, you can't tell me shit, yeah
Did it on my own, check out my neck, check out my wrist, yeah

Now a nigga gettin' rich, I swear, everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, you can't tell me shit, yeah
'Member I was broke, yeah, now I'm gettin' rich, yeah
Yeah, when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
(Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat)
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit, we Li'-Yacht'
Used to ride around with my bitch in a Fiat
A nigga walking 'round with more metal than a robot
That heat, gold chains and diamonds in my teeth (Lil' Boat)
14 thousand dollars on my feet
Nigga mad, 'cause his bitch a freak
I would be too, 'cause the honey kissing me
Call me Cousin Skeeter, fuck her, then delete her  (Lil' Boat)
