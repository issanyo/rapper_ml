[Verse 1]
Yeah she that she won’t but she will
‘Cause it’s all just a front for her friends
‘Cause when they’re not around she get down for the crown
Yeah she handle her biz
Yeah when me and her alone she gets all in the zone
Yeah she put it on me
But her friends don’t like that I’m a thug
Middle finger, tell ‘em I don’t give a fuck

[Chorus]
‘Cause girl you need a thug in your life
In your mind you know it’s the truth
Thug in your life, in your mind
You know it’s the truth
Know you tired of fuckin’ with them clowns
Lookin’ for a real nigga, I’m around

[Verse 2]
Yeah she say that she won’t but she did it before
We was all in her bed
I swear you be surprised if I chose not to hide
All the things that she did
She get freaky like a frog with a mustache
Love it when she touch that, throw it back, oh
Girl you know you hold it down
Watch you fightin’ it right now

[Chorus]
‘Cause you need a thug in your life
In your mind you know it’s the truth
Thug in your life, in your mind
You know it’s the truth
Know you tired of fuckin’ with them clowns
Lookin’ for a real nigga, I’m around

[Verse 3]
You say that you won’t but you will though
I already know how you feel though
All a nigga ask that you keep it real though
Fuck what your friends say, them bitches ain’t real yo
Why you wanna act like that?
Shawty don’t act like that
All Hollywood like you don’t fuck with niggas in the hood
That be all up in the train like that
When you know what we do, yeah
When it’s just me and you, yeah
I don’t hear that boujee shit when you be screamin’ ooh yeah
When you with me it ain’t the same
Instead of fuckin’ with them lames, girl you need a

[Chorus]
Thug in your life, in your mind
You know it’s the truth
Thug in your life, in your mind
You know it’s the truth
Tired of fuckin’ with them clowns, clowns
Lookin’ for a real nigga, I’m ‘round, ‘round
