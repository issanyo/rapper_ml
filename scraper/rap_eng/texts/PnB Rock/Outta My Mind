[Hook: PNB Roc and N.O.R.E.]
I can't get you out my mind, I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like, feel like
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Tell me what it feel like, talk to me in real life
Always been my real wife, hit the weed real light
Always be around you, love when I'm around you
When we in the club, they havin niggas surrounding you
Yeah, I'm protective, on another petigry
See a man lookin, cause a little jealousy
Crues like Penelope, you know you my shit though
This Rosay wine, this ain't no Sisko
Every way clips go, leaving home to piss though
We don't even need it in the hood, we official
Leave you for a hour and already I miss you
Pull your hair back, grab your body when I kiss you

[Hook: PNB Roc and N.O.R.E.]
I can't get you out my mind, I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like, feel like
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
All I wanna do in this world is have fun with you
Watch dumb movies, act stupid, get dumb with you
Spoyle you forever, even have a son with you
Sip these red bottles, probably got one with you
Friends know my style cause they tell you, don't leave him
Ain't no big eyes, little yous, we even
You're my heart deaman, ain't no fear creepin
Imma love you til the day I stop breathin
This is real nigga shit, I ain't gotta front though
Came a long way, since a body in the trunk though
I ain't claimin punk though, saying I'm a man now
Rather be at home, than the streets and the can now

[Hook: PNB Roc and N.O.R.E.]
I can't get you out my mind, I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like, feel like
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
I can't get you out my mind
So tell me what it feel like
