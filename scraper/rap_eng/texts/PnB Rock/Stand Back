[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Hold up, stand back, yeah
I just peeped you trynna steal my swag, yeah
I just peeped I got these haters mad, yeah
Money on my mind, I'm trynna get a bag, yeah
Dropped 300 on the whip
I just spend a dub on my bitch
I just spend like 80 on a chain
Blowing like money ain't a thang

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
When you see me I be drippin' Fendi
All these hunnids in my pocket, bitch I'm getting plenty
Ride with a semi in this fucking Bentley
I ain't a killer but don't push me nigga don't fucking tempt me
Every day another fucking deposit, yeah
I just signed a deal with kicks, I'm a fucking designer yeah
Loyalty a must, and death before dishonor, yeah
Real nigga I won't talk put that shit on my momma, yeah
Spend 3 bands on a Moncler yeah
Walked up the store with that Moncler, yeah
And you know that shit was on my back
I'm a fucking hypebeast nigga I don't know how to act
Yeah, they done gave the wrong nigga money
Ever since I got it, I been blowing money
You a broke nigga, you be owing money
At the strip club, we be throwing money
Yeah, I remember I ain't had the shit
Now I'm having shit, I'm living lavish bitch
It's at least a 500 thousand under my mattress bitch
I be fucking, ducking these hoes, I'm on my savage shit
Pulled up in that big B, they thought it was a rental
While I get my dick sucked, my seats massaging me
It's so big inside can fucking have a menage in it
She just like the squad and now all my niggas ridin' it

[Chorus: PnB Rock & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Hold up, stand back, yeah
I just peeped you trynna steal my swag, yeah
I just peeped I got these haters mad, yeah
Money on my mind, I'm trynna get a bag, yeah
Dropped 300 on the whip
I just spend a dub on my bitch
I just spend like 80 on a chain
Blowing like money ain't a thang

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I spend 7 thousand on a Balmain jacket
Looking like I got it I can probably fit a shotty in it
Now I gotta go pick up the pocket rocket
Just to get a thotty in a spot, cause I can't trust no bitches
I don't like little bodies in a big ass fucking Bentley
With a Spanish mami make her call me papi in it
I'm riding, windows tinted and she give me sloppy in it
And they tryna see whose in it, mind your fucking business
Money on mind it's always time to get it, yeah
Got Eliante jewelry so my diamonds glitter, yeah
I know she like the way I rock my Mike Amiri's, yeah
Got spikes all on my feet, so haters can't get near me, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Hold up, stand back, yeah
I just peeped you trynna steal my swag, yeah
I just peeped I got these haters mad, yeah
Money on my mind, I'm trynna get a bag, yeah
Dropped 300 on the whip
I just spend a dub on my bitch
I just spend like 80 on a chain
Blowing like money ain't a thang
Hold up, stand back, yeah
I just peeped you trynna steal my swag, yeah
I just peeped I got these haters mad, yeah
Money on my mind, I'm trynna get a bag, yeah
Dropped 300 on the whip
I just spend a dub on my bitch
I just spend like 80 on a chain
Blowing like money ain't a thang
