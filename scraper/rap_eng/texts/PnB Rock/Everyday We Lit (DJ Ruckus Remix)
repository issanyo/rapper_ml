[Chorus: PnB Rock & YFN Lucci]
I came up from nothing, nigga, you can't tell me shit, yeah
Did it on my own, check out my neck, check out my wrist, yeah
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, you can't tell me shit, yeah
'Member I was broke, yeah, now I'm gettin' rich, yeah
Yeah, when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (it's lit)
