[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Ever since I laid eyes on you
Girl, I fell in love
I fell in love instantly
Baby, you was so beautiful
From your pretty eyes to your pretty hair
And your pretty little feet
Girl, I can't get you out my mind
And I think
I think about you all the time

[Chorus]
Oh Milan
Girl, I'm so glad that you're mine
And I swear, girl, for you I'd die
Milan, I swear for you I'd die

[Verse 2]
Ay, I go out and sell drugs for you
To get the grub for you 'cause I got love for you
I swear I'd take a slug for you
You the reason I grind, yeah, you're my inspiration
Straight to the top, yeah baby we gon' make it
I swear I do it all for you
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't your ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't your ordinary love
This ain't your ordinary love
