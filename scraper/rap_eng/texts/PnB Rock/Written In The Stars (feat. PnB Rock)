[Chorus: Lauren Sanderson]
It's written in the sky like that
Why you hide like that
It's written in the stars like that
Catchin' scars like that
Your heart
So bold, so cold, so thrown
You fight right back
It doesn't have to be so cold
And you don't have to feel alone

[Verse 1: Lauren Sanderson]
I know it's hard
I know that your guard's up
You've been fightin' for so long
I know you been chasing cars, wasted hearts
You been drinking til it's gone
But I've never seen your eyes like that
Findin' diamonds in the dust
I've never seen a rose turn black
Til it's lust mistaking love

[Chorus: Lauren Sanderson]
It's written in the sky like that
Why you hide like that
It's written in the stars like that
Catchin' scars like that
Your heart
So bold, so cold, so thrown
You fight right back
It doesn't have to be so cold
(I don't wanna be alone)
And you don't have to feel alone

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
It's written in the sky like that
I be high like that
Cause I never wanna be alone
So I go out to space just to make through the day
Just hoping that sometimes you call my phone
And girl I swear every time you're around
You pick me up any time that I'm down
And you know you the shit
Every touch, every kiss
Girl you making me wanna say oh
Just for you
And everything I do girl it's just for you
I need you by my side
Cause girl you keep me satisfied
And girl I give you all my time
Cause I don't wanna be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
(nobody wants to be alone)

[Chorus: Lauren Sanderson]
It's written in the sky like that
Why you hide like that
It's written in the stars like that
Catchin' scars like that
Your heart
So bold, so cold, so thrown
You fight right back
It doesn't have to be so cold
And you don't have to feel alone

[Verse 3: Lauren Sanderson]
Lemme rock a little bit
Lemme rap a little bit
Lemme take a sec to talk about my past a little bit
Lemme cry a little bit
And type a little bit
Send you back to times when I would lie a little bit
Bout the drugs and the pills and the
The medications
I would dream of the alterations
I, well, I just wanted to be
Any, anyone but me
I promise I'm honest
I'm on this
I learned how to see
Well that it's written in the stars
And we are the definers of our own lives
And we are the deciders of our own minds
Tell me why
You would give up on yourself
Please don't give up on yourself
Was easy to blame someone else
For the things that I felt

[Outro: Lauren Sanderson and PnB Rock]
You don't have to feel alone
(I don't be alone)
You don't have to feel alone
(I don't wanna feel alone)
You don't have to feel alone
(I don't wanna feel alone
I don't wanna feel alone
I don't wanna feel alone
No I don't wanna feel alone)
