[Chorus 1: Wale]
Ooh, what it do?
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
Ooh, we comin' through
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Baby love, what is all this playing for?
Told me you ain't takin' some
Call on me to break you off, yeah
No one's up, I'm in my Uber rolling up
Say you chilling with the crew
Well, I'mma piss our homies off
Saddle up, what is all that playing for?
I wanna run up and I'm good
Don't run up my patience, though
Better fuck me like you need a love
When I drop by, I drop by gold cities [?]
At night imma put my seed in one
That's what's up
[?] a button-up
Saint Laurent might cover that
New SB's is cold as fuck
Better tell me your location, love
I'm on my way, don't say too much
Please text me you'll fuck this up

[Chorus 2: Wale & PnB Rock]
Ooh, what it do?
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
Ooh, we coming through
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
Ooh, we coming through
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
Ooh, what it do?
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Girl, what's up?
Been talking 'bout making up
Bro Wale just hit me up
Where is that we pulling up, yeah
4 am, and I was bored as fuck
So this shit kicked in the clubs
Started the night, we turning up
Got me some lean, I know you drink patron
Got me some weed and we writing this song
Shawty, I ain't tryna hear no excuses
They tryna chill, I'm tryna make you moan
You know you want the same, I don't care what you claim
So girl, don't be playing games
I am not like these lames, I'll make you scream my name
And fuck up your everything
I can't show you what no love like
But I can show you what a thug like
Gripping your weave, have you gripping the seats
I'mma probably make you fall in love like
We ain't gotta make this a project, girl
Everything you want, yeah, I got that girl
Drank's good, sex in the lobby, girl
Let's get it

[Chorus 3: Wale & PnB Rock]
Ooh, we coming through
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
Ooh, what it do?
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
