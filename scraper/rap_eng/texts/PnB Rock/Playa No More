[Intro: PnB Rock + A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Playa no more
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I don't wanna be a playa no more
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I don't wan' be a playa with you
Girl, I don't understand what you
Want, but I'm tryna make plans with you
South Beach, don't bring sand with you
South Beach, I hope you don't bring sand with you
Out to eat, every menu, I'll explain it to you
What you mean, you ain't eatin'? I ain't playin' with you
I'm just sayin', I'm the mothafuckin' man, nigga
Louis checkers on my sweatshirt
Try to draw this, I'm an artist, you a sketcher
On my grown shit, I get nauseous tryna sweat her
I'm the coldest, I recorded this in a sweater

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Shawty, I don't wanna play them games no more
Used to be a dog, I ain't the same no more, no
I ain't tryna be forgettin' names no more, no
I swear I ain't dodgin' Cupid's aim no more
So, shawty, what's up with you?
Ain't gotta tell you, you already know I fuck with you
Pretty face, pretty smile, I'm in love with you
Sike, no, but maybe I can fall in love with you
Yeah, maybe, baby, me plus you can be an item
All them bitches I be just hittin', don't really like 'em
I'ma keep it up with you, bitches, I just one night 'em
But with you it's all the way different, I'm tryna wife you, girl

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Baby girl I hope the time is right
Time's right
She said, "Quavo I hope your mind is right
I hope your mind is right"
Christian Loub', she gon' bleed tonight, yeah
Please tell me I ain't bleedin' right
When she leave I hope she need a ride
Then we pull up to the bando (SKRRR!)
I'm the one she call on (BRRRR)
I gotta leave my dogs alone (damn)
You can't give an old dog a new bone
In other words, baby girl, I'm comin' on home

[Bridge: Quavo]
Girl, you know we shine like diamonds in the sky
I don't wanna be a playa no more, no I can't lie

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more
Why you playin', shawty? I could put you on, yeah
I know I got all of these girls up in my phone, yeah
But on the real, you the only one I want, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa no more
