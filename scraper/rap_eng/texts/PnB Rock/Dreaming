Hook:
Sometimes I wake up and I feel like that i'm dreaming
A nigga made it out the mud, I can't believe it, I know a couple niggas wanna see me bleeding
Shots fired, man down I ain't breathing
I told them pussy niggas catch me when they see me, I got a bad little bitch and she conceited, sometimes I text her ? she don't even read it, and she say she love me but you know I don't believe it
Verse:
You know I don't give a fuck cause i'm a demon, put some VV's in my teeth now i'm always cheesing, went to sleep with all my ice I woke up freezing, fuck a bad bitch and you know she leaving
I'm a hot nigga on the block nigga with a Glock, see a opp now his body drop nigga fuck the cops, you can't stop this
? money, ? money busting out my pocket, niggas hating on me and gang cause we taking off like a rocket, and my bitch bad she a mixed freak, ride that dick fast like a 60, we blowing cash nigga quickly
I wonder when I die will they miss me

Verse:
Never thought I'd live like this, all these bust downs on my wrist, 2 hoes sucking on my dick, champagne coming out my piss, 30 thousand for my drip, 30 hanging on my hip, new blue hunnids yea they crisp, I take them right from the bank and I spend it
All my young niggas got bodies, they just came off a trip
Spin the block and caught opp, we left his brains in the field
