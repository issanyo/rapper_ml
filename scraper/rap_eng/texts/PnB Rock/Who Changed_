Me & You We Just Don't Get Along
You Make Me Feel Like I Did You Wrong
When I Always Kept That Shit 100
All The Money, All The Bitches Still I Never Fronted
Late Nights Me & You Gettin Faded
Taking About What We Gon Do When We Make It
Now A Nigga On The Road Now I'm Doing Shows
And You Don't Even Call My Phone Fuck Is Goin On
You Said I Changed I Said You Did
Ever Since Ya Boy Got On You On Some New Shit
Man It's Crazy Cause I Wanna Find A New Bitch
It's Fucked Up Cause I Only Trust You Bitch
