[Intro: Pook Paperz]
Feel my pain, Rock! (Oh yeah) Paperz!
Real nigga, street approved, cut different


[Chorus: PNB Rock] (2x)
You know I've been thru it all (shootouts)
Speed chases from the law (no crib)
You know I could never fraud
Lost money, lost bitches, lost friends, lost feelings
My nigga, you know I've been thru it all

[Verse 1: Pook Paperz]
Let me tell you bout my life and all the places that I've been
And why I've been at placements, been in prisons; in the pen
Shit was so real, it's no way I could pretend
And we was fucked up, it's no way I couldn't sin
See, my pop left my mom when she was pregnant
It made her bitter, we moved a lot when I was young
We barely kept the rent up
Boiled hot water to take a bath in the winter
And plenty times them stamps would land we ate sleep for dinner
I remember one Christmas, we ain't even put a tree up
We just got some candy in a sock for us to eat up
Hand-me-downs from my cousin Shawn just to keep up
And, everyday, me and Vern took that walk of shame to the park
For a free lunch
Growing up, I seen some things you prolly was used to
And yeah I had to spinning top, the other kids had scooters
Paperz, I rap about pain cuz I've been thru it
And thinkin' bout them hard times, just turned my heart cooler

[Chorus: PNB Rock] (2x)
You know I've been thru it all (shootouts)
Speed chases from the law (no crib)
You know I could never fraud
Lost money, lost bitches, lost friends, lost feelings
My nigga, you know I've been thru it all

[Verse 2: Pook Paperz]
By the age of 14, I was a shooter
Caught my first gat case; P89 Ruger
Runnin' round like Bishop when he was tryna get his Juice up
Stoned like Medusa, I'm talkin' higher than a roofer
(Look cuz) went from the youth to the mills
To George W. Hill
From there, straight to state road, up the "F" where it was real
17, I made the paper, shit was lookin' ugly
Shit, I wasn't even 20, they tried to give me 20
On trial with 12 white juries; looking at me
Nigga on the stand saying I shot him, while he pointin' at me
But, I don't regret none of my time in the can
Cuz, yeah the streets made me, but jail made me a man
I done been thru it all, the struggles and the loss
The hustles in the dark, niggas' prayin' for my fall
Born rider from the start, it's Pook Paperz; feel my pain
Shit real when I talk, everything from the heart

[Chorus: PNB Rock] (2x)

[Verse 3: PNB Rock]
I watched my homie get abused when we lived in that shelter
By a pussy nigga, I was just too young to help him
But, its kool cuz boy, I know your name
And, if I ever run into you, you know you gon' feel my pain
Free my brother "Meen", we've been through hell and back
I swear, at least that's what it seem
We slept close in abandon cribs cuz we ain't have no heat
3 days straight, sellin' dummies, burnin' all the fiends
Man, I swear that shit was real, we was really in the field
I done seen niggas' get killed, fuckin' niggas' up in jugg
And, we just did that for the thrill
I done see niggas' fold, couple niggas' told
Judge gave a nigga 30, turned that young nigga old
Fuck is up wit that? I had enough of that
They giving niggas' life, like you're comin' back
Nigga, if you dig it up, you could find these facts
I look at my past, and I be like

[Chorus: PNB Rock] (2x)
