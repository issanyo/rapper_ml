[Verse 1]
I liked the way that Kanye did it
But I'ma do it way, way different
I'ma take you to the streets
I'ma take you to the hood
I'ma show you how a young nigga livin'
Cause you don't know where I came from
You don't know what I been thru
Everyday I think about how
My brother could've died from a punch I threw
You can't tell me shit, fuck you
I been thru hell and back times two
Yeah, but I swear right now I feel resurrected
Yeah, after my next meal they gon' respect it
I'm comin' crazy, I'm comin' reckless
Talk to me crazy, you gon' regret it
Cause you gon' be finished
Yeah right now I'm ending shit
Had to get back on my ignorant

[Verse 2]
Like when I was trappin'
I was out there stackin'
Head some niggas was plottin'
So I grabbed me a ratchet
Went and got the drop
Come up when he was lackin'
Before he knew what happened
I pulled out and start...
I ain't even gon' talk about it
We ain't even gon' talk about it
Pussy nigga don't say nothin'
You was there, don't say nothin'
Cops comin', don't say nothin'
Don't make me an enemy
You don't wanna make me your enemy
Took my soul, they don't know what they did to me
Time heals nothing, it just replays memories

[Verse 3]
Had some fucked up mornings
But I'ma turn 'em to better days
Cause I'ma go harder
I'ma be smarter
I'ma go farther
Had some fucked up mornings
But I'ma turn 'em to better days
Cause I'ma go harder
I'ma go farther
I'ma think smarter
Had some fucked up mornings
But I'ma turn 'em to better days
Cause I'ma go harder
I'ma go farther
I'ma think smarter
Had some fucked up mornings
But I'ma turn 'em to better days
Cause I'ma go harder
I'ma think smarter
I'ma go farther
