That be maaly raw

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I understand you
You understand me
That is the plan A
Fuck a plan B
I hold it down for you
You hold it down for me
Shawty you ain't gotta ask it
Hit the mall up, you can grab it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
I'm a real ass nigga I got it
Them bands all in my pocket
I fuck with you shawty you know it
I get the wood and you roll it
All of these hoes they be on it
But you the only one that I'm wanting
When you call me at 3 in the morning
Like "Daddy come hit it I'm horny"
I come through and put it on you
Fuck you and I have you moaning
Shawty, you say that you love me
Shawty, you say that you trust me
You know I be in the trap
You know it's times that I might not make it back
'Cause you know it's time that I be on the block
And you know it's times I be running from cops
Throwing them shots at them opps
Spinning the block on them opps
Shawty, you be on my mind
'Cause you the only one that I got
You the only one that understands me
And that shit really means alot

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I understand you
You understand me
That is the plan A
Fuck a plan B
I hold it down for you
You hold it down for me
Shawty you ain't gotta ask it
Hit the mall up, you can grab it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'

[Verse 2: Asian Doll]
I'm bad I know it
My money be floating
These niggas can't touch me
My baby I'm holdin'
You kiss me and tell me that I am so pretty
No make up when we fuck
These bitches can't see em
Who got you my baby
You driving me crazy
I can't tell I won't tell I make bails
Ain't no jail
I call you around 2
I know you gone come through
Then pull up in that foreign
That's my baby bitches boring
You my drug get your love
Don't worry he can't fuck
I'm a dog I'm so spoiled
When I'm with you I'm in love
In the trap but I rap
I don't cap
Sex with me
Amazing
Real young bitch
I'm so patient, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I understand you
You understand me
That is the plan A
Fuck a plan B
I hold it down for you
You hold it down for me
Shawty you ain't gotta ask it
Hit the mall up, you can grab it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
If you want it you got it
You a bad ass bitch, you poppin'
