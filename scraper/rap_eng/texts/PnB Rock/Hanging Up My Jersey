[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I'm just keeping it a hunnit'
Girl, fuck a fifty
I need a bad bitch, who's loyal
And ain't too mixy for me
Need a jawn to help me count this paper
I need a real chick with no filter on and no makeup

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
'Cause I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
Yeah, they talk that cuffing shit
But they all be with the shits
Yeah, I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
But now I'm in a different space
Tired of all these bitches in my face
So shawty, where you at, 'cause I'm around
I'm hanging up my jersey for you
When I find you, I'ma lock you down

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Right now, I'm riding down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down
I couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But Imma run it up regardless
And having you here is better
That's the truth, right now
I'm right down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down too
Couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But if you really need me
Shawty, please believe me
Know, that I'll always be there for you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I bought a 911 and a new crib
I need a bad bitch to ride passenger
When I drive that shit
And she might tell me "Dolla slow down"
But she gone take that D
She gonna take that D for Dolla

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & PnB Rock]
'Cause I done been around the world
Fucked a lot of girls
Yeah, they talk that cuffing shit
But they still be with the shits
Yeah, I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
But now I'm in a different space
Tired of all these bitches in my face
So shawty, where you at, 'cause I'm around
I'm hanging up my jersey for you
When I find you, I'ma lock you down

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
I don't really want to do nothing
Back then I ain't do cuffin'
I was really on some savage shit
Out there looking for the baddest bitch
Once I hit it, I was dashing quick
Fuck and duck, I might've mastered it
Now I'm feeling like I changed now
Need a girl to be my main now
So where you been, 'cause I'm looking for you
Got some plans and they all for you
I got bands and they all for you
Real nigga I'm just trynna spoil you
Want some sex, but I know, it's more to you
Fuck your ex, I could do more for you girl
I'm so tired of chasing these hoes
Can't wait to call someone my own

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Right now, I'm riding down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down
I couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But Imma run it up regardless
And having you here is better
That's the truth, right now
I'm right down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down too
Couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But if you really need me
Shawty, please believe me
Know, that I'll always be there for you
