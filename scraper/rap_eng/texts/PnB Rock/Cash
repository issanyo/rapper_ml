(Bridge)
I don't got the cash
Don't wanna brag
Broker than a mug
My homie do the math
I don't want the story
I just want that cash

(Chorus)
Cash, cash, cash, cash
I don't owe you money my homie do that
Cash, cash, cash, cash
I'm telling the truth, I'm don't want to brag

(Hook)
You ain't never dish out a mixtape
You ain't never dish out a big take
I don't want to hear your drama
My homie don't do that
I just want to know the facts
I don't owe you anything
I need to get your freaking stash
All weed, no cigarettes my homie
Cuz that stuff is trash
I don't like that sneak diss
I don't like that weak shit
I just want to know how the real deal is
Rapping like Montana
And I don't have a bandanna
I'm not making no sense right now
So I pass the mike to Hannah
Migos had that song right
Even know they're from Atlanta
My homie Drake got the price
No more songs for my camera
I'm like a shark out in these in streets
All red on no beef
I'm not from the from the freaking crap
And she's using the freaking map
I don't want that back
Please give me a gun a mask
I want to get out in the world
So you can do the math
Are you choosin?
Or are you loosin?
I've been packing up the m's
And I don't go losing
Yeah

(Chorus)
Cash, cash, cash, cash
I don't owe you money my homie do that
Cash, cash, cash, cash
I'm telling the truth, I'm don't want to brag
