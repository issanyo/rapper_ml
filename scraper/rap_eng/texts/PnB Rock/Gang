Bitch im posting wit my motherfucking gang
A hundred niggas deep, yeah thats how I came
Pull up in 20 ubers, wit' trappers, rappers, and a couple shooters
All this ice it like I rob my jeweler
So much gold, bitch I rigged the ruler
Fuck all these niggas that hatin' on me (fuck)
'Cause I know that they bitches waiting on me
And I got bitches, new fragrance on me
Got the 40 on me, what you thinking homie
My soldier he stay wit' the glizzy
I just poured a deuce in my fridgy (codeine)
All these drugs got me dizzy
These bitches love me like Im drizzy
Aye, I just landed up in New York
Smoking on back woods, no new port
You know that we eatin like food court
You know that I ball like I'm too short
And you know that your bitch on me

And my neck and my wrist glowin'

And her titties sitting perfect
Take her home, I feel perfect
Run up homie, that's the purpose
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

These bitches fucking for the fame
Two black 40's makes pains
Shorty gotta' stay in my lane
Man these new niggas super lame
Yo' bitch give me super brain
Four couver switchin' lanes
Five figures for the chain
I pull up in a benz
Scopa in a france
Take her to the spot, hit her with my twin
Copped it off the lot, using all 10
Had to drop the top, my head in the wind
Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang
Diamond singing, bling bling
Oh, that was yo' main thing
We just ran a gang train
Fuck all you niggas that hating on me
Now I got money, they waitin' on me
Diamonds, they dancin' and skatin' on me
These bitches, they love me like I'm on tv
