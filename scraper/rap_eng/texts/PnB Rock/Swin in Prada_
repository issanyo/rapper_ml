[Swae Lee]
Maybe I know what you love (know)
Even if I'm not the one you love
Catch it, can I see you crawling?
...
Swim in Prada, swim in Prada, swim in Prada, hot as lava
Five chains, top shotta
[?] over yonder, yeah, yeah
Swim in Prada, swim in Prada, swim in Prada, hot as lava
...
Hit the lotto, yeah
Smoking avocado, yeah

[Verse: PnB Rock]
Oh, yeah
Body slamming on my chain (chain)
12 bands on my pinky ring
My little bitch from Spain (Spain), most times don't know what she saying
...

Got a little bitch, she like Jimmy Choo
She so bad, she so cute
And she always bring a friend or two
My wrist game so brazy (brazy), all my diamonds wet like rain (rain, rain)
I just feel like I'm Johnny Dang, woah (woah)
There she go
