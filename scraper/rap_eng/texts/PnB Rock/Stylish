[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish

All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish
Everything so stylish

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
All these bitches on me ‘cause I’m stylish
Every night a different thot because I’m poppin’
Money, clothes, cars, and hoes
You know that’s the way it goes
I’m trappin’ and movin’ that work, them O’s
Spent most of my money on dope and clothes
My belt say Fendi, my jeans they Truey
My shirt say Truey, my sneaks they two three
Your bitch a groupie, she wanna do me
And you know I’m gon’ take her home
And fuck her to my favorite song like
Real good, I make her feel good
When we be all up in them sheets
You a skinny nigga, a lil drippy nigga
That could fuck your bitch, that’s me
And she hear that I RnB
I’m the hottest in these streets
And she see I fuck with Leen
And she wanna fuck with me ‘cause

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish
Everything so stylish
All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish
Everything so stylish

[Verse 2: Leen Bean]
Everything so stylish, I don’t even need a stylist
The future’s mine, just being honest
I know I’m next but still modest
Without a deal, I still got a deal
I got deals on the table, that’s a lot of mils
That’s a lot of meals
Do that make you nervous? [?] pill
Why would I care about designer clothes
When I can call up Kev to design my clothes
Got better style, I’m beyond blessed
Everything fresh out on my clothes
See it all through my third eye
This the lifestyle that I live for
Can’t just be fly, I was born fly
I could drip shit from the thrift store
They like Bean what’s that line though
Trill shit, and my shirt by Milano
Teddy bear the gear, it ain’t Ralph though
Toms on my feet, it’s my time ho
They like Bean what’s that line though
Trill shit, and my shirt by Milano
Teddy bear the gear, it ain’t Ralph though
Toms on my feet, it’s my time ho

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish
Everything so stylish
All my shit be so stylish
All my bitches be stylish
Lame nigga get stylish
You hate me ‘cause I’m stylish
All my niggas be stylish
Fuckin’ real, we stylish
Without a deal, we stylish
Everything so stylish
