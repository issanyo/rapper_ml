[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Loyalty, I got it tatted
I live that shit, that's what I'm bout
If one of my niggas get booked
Just know that I'm bailing him out
As long as I'm gettin' this money
There'll never ever be a drought
Yeah that's as long as I'm around
My niggas, I will hold 'em down
Cause way before the money
Yeah they was my homies
We ain't on no new shit
Because they knew the old me
Now these hoes, they on me
Your bitch, she done chose me
Watch how I just fuck her
Then pass her to my homies

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
Cause I ride for all my niggas
I'ma die for all my niggas
I shoot a nigga dead
Take the case, stand tall
Go to trial for all my niggas
Get high with all my niggas
Fly with all my niggas
And if you ain't know, yeah yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
That's the shit we on
Get money with all my niggas
Stunt with all my niggas
Ain't nun cause they all my niggas
That's the shit we on
Hit hoes with all my niggas
Got love for all my niggas
Hell yeah I'ma go for all my niggas
That's the shit we on
That's the shit we on
I'ma ride for all my niggas
Die for all my niggas
Send a nigga to his god for all my niggas
That's the shit we on

[Verse 2: Monty]
I put on my niggas
Nothin' but love for my niggas
I done come up with my niggas
Swear it was tough for my niggas
Ain't have much with my niggas
Pull up and puff with my niggas
Some niggas'll turn their back
But I'm just up with my niggas
Remember where you came from
I wonder what you gon' do when the fame gone
I know you say it's right, I got my chain on
You know I'm livin' life, I'm with my day ones
I'm with my day ones

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
Cause I ride for all my niggas
I'ma die for all my niggas
I shoot a nigga dead
Take the case, stand tall
Go to trial for all my niggas
Get high with all my niggas
Fly with all my niggas
And if you ain't know, yeah yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
That's the shit we on
Get money with all my niggas
Stunt with all my niggas
Ain't nun cause they all my niggas
That's the shit we on
Hit hoes with all my niggas
Got love for all my niggas
Hell yeah I'ma go for all my niggas
