[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She wanna be sneaky and fuck with all of us
She knows what she doin', go 'head and run it up
Yeah we rockin' Dasikhi's like we from Africa
Used to do [?] now its 2K and up

[Post-Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Don't be layin' up
Everytime you come over we be layin', oh, oh
Don't be layin' up
Everytime you come over we be layin', oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Kiss on my neck, I'm off them percy's, I be raspin'
Speak on my name, you speak on me, just speak the facts
Ooh, me PnB, A Boogie, this shit gon' be classic
She suck my dick in the middle of the floor, I gotta dump these ashes
I don't trick off, I don't buy nothinn', might buy some lashes
Durkio, I like my bitches ratchet
Styrofoam, I mixed the lean with Xanax
You ain't did nothin' for me to take yo' ass to Lenox
Two Glocks, my double G's, ain't talkin' Gucci pendant
I got a girl at home, so when I'm done my brother hit it
Love-dovey new to me, I'm from the gutter wit' it
And the opps our brothers, but we screamin' fuck them niggas

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, you know me, I'm screamin' fuck them niggas
And everytime they came to beef, they want problems wit' it
And everytime it came to police we was on silence wit' it
Red dot on your homie just for ridin' with him
Red dot to your dome piece just for ridin' wit' him
It's gone be hard for me to sleep, but thank God we did it
And all these broads on me, it be so hard to miss 'em
Look at the cars in my V, bitch my car different

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
Aw man, I done got used to this lifestyle
Quarter million, that's some jewelry, someone turn the lights down
Bad bitch all on my trap phone, she said she ready to pull up
Soon as she touch down in the city
She gone be pullin' her skirt up
She got lip gloss on her lips, now it's lip gloss on my dick
She get's super freaky with the split
Got me bustin' like a loaded clip (brrt)
I stay automatic, drippin, in all the fashion (yeah)
Hunnid bands bustin' out the wrapper
I ain't like none of these cappers (no)
I cut so many of my dogs off, that shit don't make no sense
Same niggas that watch me starve when I ain't have a pot to piss
Say you ain't got it for your dog, but you got it for your bitch
And now she crazy, these streets they get shady

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
She wanna be sneaky and fuck with all of us
She knows what she doin', go 'head and run it up
Yeah we rockin' Dasikhi's like we from Africa
Used to do [?] now its 2K and up

[Post-Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Don't be layin' up
Everytime you come over we be layin', oh, oh
Don't be layin' up
Everytime you come over we be layin', oh, oh
