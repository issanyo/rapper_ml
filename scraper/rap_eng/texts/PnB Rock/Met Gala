[Intro: 24hrs & PnB Rock]
24hrs
Oh, yeah
Uh

[Chorus: 24hrs & PnB Rock]
Lil' waist (Lil' waist), fat ass (Fat ass)
She said, "Twenty, teach me how to get a bag" (How to get a bag)
Attitude, gotta holla (Gotta holla)
Caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Met)
But you wouldn't know what to do with it
All this money, you wouldn't know what to do with it
You don't know what to do with it
I'll let you hold it, you wouldn't know what to do with it
You wouldn't know what to do with it (Know what to do with it)
All this money, you wouldn't know what to do with it (You don't know what to do)
Attitude, gotta holla (Yeah, yeah)
She caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Raspberry, blueberry
She hop in the Phantom lookin' really scary
Playa shit, talkin' Will and Jada shit
First class, we go out to Vegas quick
Backend, shawty, let me see your back bend
You so bad, you don't even need a caption
Push to start, what's the route to your heart
Diamonds do the Milly Rock in the dark
From the jump, knew I had to kill
Louis heel, show me how that booty feel
Pussy good, you should get a reward
We go shoppin', we gone fuck up Dior

[Chorus: 24hrs & PnB Rock]
Lil' waist, fat ass (Ass)
She said, "Twenty, teach me how to get a bag" (Get a bag)
Attitude, gotta holla (Gotta holla)
Caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Met Gala)
You don't know what to do with it (Yeah)
All this money, you wouldn't know what to do with it
Attitude, gotta holla (Yeah)
She caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Look at you in all that powder
Look at me I'm drippin' in Balenciaga
To the sage, you know we go to sleep in the sauna
Philly nigga, I wake up and spend these dollars
Yeah, and I might cop you a new lay today
You could be my new lil bae today
First class, I might fly you to LA today
Deal drop, I might blow a 100k today
And you ain't even gotta ask it
Took you to store, 'cause I know you was into fasting
Met Gala, Gucci on your collar, now you flashy
Lambo doors goin' up like a dragon

[Chorus: 24hrs & PnB Rock]
Lil' waist (Lil), fat ass (Fat ass)
She said, "Twenty, teach me how to get a bag" (How to get a bag)
Attitude, gotta holla (Gotta holla)
Caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Met)
You don't know what to do with it (Know what to do with it)
All this money, you wouldn't know what to do with it (You don't know what to do)
Attitude, gotta holla (Yeah yeah)
She caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Break: 24 Hours & PnB Rock]
Tell me, what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
I done called you like fifty eleven time (Yeah)
Beat it everyday, girl that is not a crime (Beat it up)
We gone have to fuck on a brand new day (Brand new)
PnB 20 in a brand new Wraith (Brand new)
Damn, matching Montclair (Yeah)
First you get your nails done, then you fix your hair (You get your hair)

[Chorus: 24hrs & PnB Rock]
Lil' waist (Lil), fat ass (Fat ass)
She said, "Twenty, teach me how to get a bag" (How to get a bag)
Attitude, gotta holla (Gotta holla)
Caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Met Gala)
You don't know what to do with it (Know what to do with it)
All this money, you wouldn't know what to do with it (You don't know what to do)
Attitude, gotta holla (Yeah yeah)
She caught me slippin', dressin' like the Met Gala (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Outro: 24 Hours & PnB Rock]
At the Met Gala
Oh, at the Met Gala
Yeah, uh uh
