Hitmaka!

[Chorus]
Met her in the A, told her where I be
I just wanna see, she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh
Met her in the A, told her where I be
I just wanna see, she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh

[Verse 1]
Can't trust nobody, not just anybody
Gotta watch my back, I'm not just anybody
Just play it for me
Girl it's a movie
I can't waste no time
I wanna make you mine
I want more than conversations
I don't know how you could take it

[Chorus]
Met her in the A, told her where I be
I just wanna see, she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh (friend zone)
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh (friend zone)
Met her in the A, told her where I be
I just wanna see, she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh (friend zone)
Miss me with the friend zone, ooh (friend zone)

[Verse 2]
Met her in the A, told her where I be
She just want the D
Yeah, that's when I pull up
Ooh-ooh, when I pull up
Ice on me, put that ice on you
You already know how a young nigga move
Put her on bands, look at that thang
Bought her a [?], tripled this stack
Fuck around, I brought my beach to the sand
Wanna be more than just friends
Wanna see you with them M's
Damn

[Chorus]
Met her in the A, told her where I be (yeah)
I just wanna see, she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone (friend), ooh
Miss me with the friend zone (friend), ooh
Met her in the A, told her where I be (yeah)
I just wanna see (yeah), she just want the D
Miss me with the friend zone (friend), ooh
Miss me with the friend zone (friend), ooh
