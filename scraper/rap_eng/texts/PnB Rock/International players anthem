Aw yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Time to separate myself from all these clown niggas
You ain't in my circle than you can't be around niggas
You get no handshake you get a pound nigga
That's even if you get close enough to be around niggas
Cus we don't like new faces unless they blue faces
And we don't do new niggas
Cus low key they be hating
And we don't trust these bitches
Cus low key they be snaking
To be catching all these flights ain't no more catching cases
I remember trapping at it wearing the same clothes
Couldn't drip cus I kept fucking up my bankroll
I remember I was homeless had like eight hoes
Couldn't fuck cus I ain't have nowhere to take off
Could you imagine that
Abandon cribs my habitat
Hit a lick then got locked up
Lost it all and got it back
Man I swear I couldn't make this up
This my life and it's hard for me to recreate this stuff
(Man this shit be crazy cus sometimes I be sitting back and I be thinking like damn I really came from the fucking mud like young nigga done came up)
Did this shit all with my brodies
I won't switch up on my brodies
Lately shit been going done
Don't approach me lIke you know me
Niggas tryna take me out
So I keep about thirty on me
I won't let em take me out
Cus they bite they banking on me
They took my shit ain't really shit you can do to me
They took my bro now my future ain't what it used to be
We was suppose to do it all
New ice new cars
Now I'm looking to the stars
Damn we took a major lost
Now I Gotta go harder
Now I gotta be smarter
Kill a nigga for I leave my daughter
It's up to me to keep this shit in order
(Ha ha like I'll never go back to jail again you feel me I maxed out my daughter will never have to go through what I went through )
Aw yeah
And I know the streets will miss me a little I was gone but I'm back again
Thankful I ain't never gotta trap again
I won't never have to put my hands behind my back again
All my days in jail are over I ain't going back again
Whole time I was poppin I was on the run
Now I'm free I feel like my life has just begun
Hell yeah hell yeah I done maxed out
All my real niggas yeah they know what that's bout
Taking over time for me to do this shit
Mont told me no more room for the stupid shit
Feels good to be no longer a fugitive
Fuck that let's get back to this music shit
I been only going hard for about a year
But ask about in ya city bet I'm popping there
My folks still in the hood I'm tryna get em out of there
Got niggas in the jail can't wait till they get outa there
Cash rules everything dollar dollar bill
And every not I have another dream about a mil
I had fans in London way before I had a deal
Cus im the hottest youngin in my city that's for real
Name ya favorite rapper bet he ask me for a hook
All my shit do numbers Yal could put me in the books
Crazy last summer all a nigga knew was jugg
Now this year rock done hopped up in that Porsche
Yeah yeah
