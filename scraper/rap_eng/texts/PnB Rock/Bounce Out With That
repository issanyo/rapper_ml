[Chorus]
(Gang) Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, ayy
Shot call, lil nigga, I'ma stay wild (huh, huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)
Shot call, lil nigga, I'ma stay wild (bitch)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (grrah, pow, pow, pow)

[Post-Chorus]
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (hell nah)
Off tops, new chain and my wrist froze (on the gang)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (huh)
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (hell nah)
Off tops, new chain, and my wrist froze (huh)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (ayy, gang)

[Verse]
Stop it, niggas knowin' that I drop shit (I drop shit)
Get popped quick 'cause them niggas that you rock with (rock with)
Like Jay said, bitch I gotta keep a chopstick (grrah)
Big stick, I bounce out with that mop stick (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
These niggas talkin', watch I pull up in that fuckin' Hemi (skrrt)
Tote automatics so I pass my lil bro the semi (on the gang)
I'ma rock this lil bitch 'til that tank empty (huh)
I'ma still blow that bitch 'til the clip empty (ayy, gang)

[Bridge]
Bitch I'm a P (what), bitch I'm a G (huh)
Took that lil bitch now that bitch off the leash (ayy, ayy, ayy, gang)

[Chorus]
Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (pass her to the clique, nigga)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, huh
Shot call, lil nigga, I'ma stay wild (stay wild)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (dog pound)
Shot call, lil nigga, I'ma stay wild (huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
