[Intro: Desiigner & PnB Rock]
Earl on the beat
Yeah, I'm cookin’ it'
[?]
Cookin'
Cookin’ in the pot
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Desiigner]
That's all, (that's all)
That's all, (that's all)
30 on the clip, that's wild, (that’s wild)
Don’t ever trust a bitch, that's a loss, (that’s a loss)
And I'm cookin' out the pot, that's hot, (that’s hot)
That's all
That's all, (that's all)
30 on the clip, that's wild, (that's wild)
Don't ever trust a bitch, that's a loss, (that's a loss)
And I'm cookin' out the pot, that's hot, (that's hot)

[Verse]

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Desiigner]
That's all, (that's all)
That's all, (that's all)
30 on the clip, that's wild, (that's wild)
Don't ever trust a bitch, that's a loss, (that's a loss)
And I'm cookin' out the pot, that's hot, (that's hot)
That's all
That's all, (that's all)
30 on the clip, that's wild, (that's wild)
Don't ever trust a bitch, that's a loss, (that's a loss)
And I'm cookin' out the pot, that's hot, (that's hot)
