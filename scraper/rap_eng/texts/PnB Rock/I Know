Oh yeah
Oo oo
Real shit

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong and baby girl I can't change that
But I wrote this song cause girl  I don't want your heart
To way remain that, that way I left it girl
I know your heart was torn
And I don't want you to feel like you were all alone
Girl  it wasn't you but instead it was me
And everything will be alright even though it's hard to see
Baby girl don't stress the fact that you ain't got a man
I'm sorry that I hurt you baby you don't understand

[Chorus]
Listen I know I did you wrong
And baby ain't no changing that
But girl our love is strong
So maybe we can take it back to, to that one point in time
Girl  when you were mine
And I was always on your mind (x2) yeah

[Verse 2]
Now listen shawty I know how you feeling
But I just had my own little problems I had to deal with
Like all them other ladies that I was sneaking round with
Telling me that they should be my one and only down chick
But I just couldn't see at the time that you was hurting
And I just hope this song that I'm singing to you is working
Cause, I just can't breathe without you
Girl I can't eat without you
(boy) I can't sleep without you
Baby I can't be me without you

[Chorus]
Listen I know I did you wrong
And baby ain't no changing that
But girl our love is strong
So maybe we can take it back to, to that one point in time
Girl when you were mine
And I was always on your mind (x2) yeah

[Outro]
I ain't fell in love since you
It wasn't real if it wasn't you
I swear different bitches they can't fuck with you
The way you left me girl, what was a thug to do
