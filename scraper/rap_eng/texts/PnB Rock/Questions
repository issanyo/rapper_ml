[Hook]
You keep on asking me questions about who I'm texting and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
Cause I can't take it no no, no no

[Verse 1]
Why you always asking all these questions
I ain't about to be over here stressin'
Thinking about what I'm finna say now
This is starting to be everyday now
Girl you got me and you know it so just don't trip
And don't be texting asking questions about no hoe shit
Cause when you ask, that's when it all falls down
If it's meant to be, time will tell
And we was doing good if you asked me
Till you start asking about Tiffany and Ashley
Said you seen my car and we drove right passed you
You said I ain't getting nothing pass you

[Hook]
You keep on asking me questions about who I'm texting and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
Cause I can't take it no no
No more questions
No more questions

[Verse 2]
Why you always asking these questions
Like you my PO girl you got a nigga stressin'
Thinking about what I'm finna say now
We been going through this everyday now
We was good if you asked me
Hit it from the back you was calling me daddy
Till you start asking about Tiffany and Ashley
That's when shit start getting nasty

[Hook]
You keep on asking me questions about who I'm texting and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
Cause I can't take it no no
You keep on asking me questions about who I'm texting and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
Cause I can't take it no no
