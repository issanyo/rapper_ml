[Chorus]
Baby it was real
Yeah we were the best
When we had each other we had everything
But nothing last forever
Not even wedding rings
Shit ain't been the same since you left
Can't even lie, something 'bout you
Sometimes ain't no telling what I might do

[Verse 1]
I'ma just keep it a hunnit
Girl I've been missin your lovin'
Especially when we was fucking
Them other bitches ain't nothin' to me
I miss the old times when I had you by my side
Thinkin 'bout your style, your smile
And I ain't telling no lie, no lie, no
Now you know I done came up
Fuck it had to switch the lane up
You been running with the same niggas
I don't went and got some new bitches
We use to get out and fade away
Now we can't even smoke weed no more
Nowadays we don't even speak no more
And you can say whatever shawty we both know

[Chorus]
Baby it was real
Yeah we were the best
When we had each other we had everything
But nothing last forever
Not even wedding rings
Shit ain't been the same since you left

Sometimes ain't no telling what I might do

[Verse 2]
Baby you know you was really all about me
Never tried to play what the fuck we was
I ain't nevermind spending money on you
I just copped two cause I love you
So, yeah
Don't you ever get it wrong, yeah
You can't never leave me alone, yeah
Cause I'm the one that put you on, yeah
Hold up, hold up, I won't tell you twice
Real shit don't always come around
And you know love ain't for sale
I'ma keep it real
The past is the past see, ain't nobody like me
You ain't gonna never see a real nigga like me
Bitches start falling for the fame and the money
But I won't never forget you if they ask me

[Chorus]
Baby it was real
Yeah we were the best
When we had each other we had everything
But nothing last forever
Not even wedding rings

[Verse 3]
I've been faded way too long now
Alright fuck it I'm so gone now
They ain't think I was this racked up
I can help you get your racks up
We just want to fucking fade away
Just waiting for this lane to settle in
Young rich niggas every day
Just wish you was here with me ballin'

[Chorus]
Baby it was real
Yeah we were the best
When we had each other we had everything
But nothing last forever
Not even wedding rings
Shit ain't been the same since you left
