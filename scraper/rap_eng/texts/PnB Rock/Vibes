[Intro]
All these games
You playing with me girl
And you need to stop it
You need to

[Chorus]
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high

[Verse 1]
She said she wanna roll with a nigga like me
'Cause she know I'm well and she know I'm icy
I just fuck with her 'cause she so pricey
She just like me
She just like me
If she roll that dope (uh)
Gucci flip flops for the toes (uh)
Two passwords for the phone (uh)
And she keep it all on the low (uh)
She ain't worried 'bout these hoes (oh no)
She ain't worried 'bout these hoes (oh no)
Yeah she know she got it
Yeah she know she popping
She shine like my diamonds
She call me I'm sliding
All these niggas watching
All these bitches watching
Yeah she know she got it

[Chorus]
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high

[Verse 2]
Shorty on go
Shorty on go
Shorty a pro
Shorty a pro
She know she a bad bitch
She know she a bad bitch
Shorty savage
Shorty savage
She get high like me but we off different drugs
She fuck with me 'cause she know that I'm a thug
I fuck with her 'cause I know that she gon' keep it all the 100 with me
Yeah I know she want it
And I know she gon' get cashed out on you
Cash out it ain't nothing
I'm so glad I found you, you my best friend
Shorty you a blessing
You a blessing

[Chorus]
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
She said she wanna ride
She said she like my vibes
She wanna get high
She wanna get high
