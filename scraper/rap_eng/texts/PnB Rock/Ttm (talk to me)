(Pnb Rock)

I don’t ever care about this

You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would of came up without me
Grown people need love

(Yeah)
I don’t really care about this (this this this)
And i don’t ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me

(Yeah)
Why you wanna make things up?
Why you wanna waste my time ?
Girl we used to be in love, now i don’t really care about you no more
We used to be perfect
Now it ain’t working
Now a nigga swerving

Drop top coupe
Girl you used to be my boo
Now you telling lies on me
Shawty this is sad with you

Drop top coupe
Girl you used to ride with me
Girl you used to slide with me
Now you telling lies on me

I don’t really care about this (this this this)
And i don’t ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me

You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would of came up without me
Grown people need love

(Wiz Khalifa)

You talk too much about me
Said i don’t show you love, you doubt me
Imma roll one, get cloudy
But my pockets wasn’t enough, you wasn’t around me

Why you wanna roll one up ?
Why you keep calling my line ?
Girl you used to keep it a G, but i don’t need to smoke with you

Drop top coupe
Girl you used to be my boo
Now you see my brand new thang
Wishing you was in her shoes

(Pnb Rock)

I don’t really care about this ( this this this)
And i don’t ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me

You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would of came up without me
Grown people need love

I don’t really care about this (this this)
And i don’t ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You talk too much (2x)

(I knew what i like from you)
You talk too much
I know what you like
I know what you like from me
