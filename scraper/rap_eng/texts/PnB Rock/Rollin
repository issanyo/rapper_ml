My eyes low cause I was smokin'

Cause the dope was super potent
Your bitch on me and she open
She keep wantin' me to poke her
She be sayin' she in love
Every time a nigga stroke her
I'm tastin' paper everyday
And my life changin' everyday
Bitches sayin' I'm conceited
Cause I'm so stuck in all my ways
Soon as I get it I fuck up the money
Don't carry twenties, just fifties and hundreds
New Giuseppe's on my feet this ain't nothin'
This life that I'm living, I swear that I love it
That's cause I'm ballin'
These bitches, they know I'm ballin'
You keep sayin' she your girl

You say you love her, I feel sorry
Cause I just passed her to my brother
That ain't your baby, you need Maury
Cause I know three niggas that fucked her
This is the life, I swear that this is the life
I'm whippin', whippin' in a different foreign
Hittin' different bitches every night
You ain't gettin' to the money nigga
Come on, you know you ain't livin' right
I love me a good minaj
And yesterday I had it twice
That's cause
