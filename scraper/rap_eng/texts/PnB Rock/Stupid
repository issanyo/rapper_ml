[Verse 1: Inas X]
When we had each other
I just wanted love you
I don't know how this got so messed up
Letting go so hard to do

[Pre Chorus]
But I'm tired of falling in and out of love
My mind's so clouded now, mind's so clouded now
Fussing and fighting, I think I've had enough
One more one more let me down, one more one more let me down

[Chorus]
I'm stupid when it comes to you
I just can't, can't get over you
Why am I so stupid when it comes to you
Baby I don't know why I keep coming back to you
The things you do, I go dumb for you

[Verse 2: Inas X]
When we had each other
I gave my all to you
We know we're better off not together
So why do I still love you

[Pre Chorus]
But I'm tired of falling in and out of love
My mind's so clouded now, mind's so clouded now
Fussing and fighting, I think I've had enough
One more one more let me down, one more one more let me down

[Chorus]
I'm stupid when it comes to you
I just can't, can't get over you
Why am I so stupid when it comes to you
Baby I don't know why I keep coming back to you
The things you do, I go dumb for you

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
Oh yeah
Girl you say you're stupid for me
Your friends yeah they all agree
But you know this where you wanna be
Cause can't nobody do you like me

[Verse 4: PnB Rock]
I did my dirt a few times yeah we know that
Please girl, don't talk bout the past
We can't go back
Gave me the key to your heart, you said "Hold that"
Trust me girl I'll hold you down and you know that

[Verse 5: PnB Rock]
I can do that
Let me prove that
You said Cupid got you feeling stupid
I'm the one for you and you knew that
No more hard times, I won't put you through that

[Verse 6: PnB Rock]
No, I don't want no other girl
It could be us against the world
But you keep playing
And you keep saying

[Chorus]
I'm stupid when it comes to you
I just can't, can't get over you
Why am I so stupid when it comes to you
Baby I don't know why I keep coming back to you
The things you do, I go dumb for you (2x)
