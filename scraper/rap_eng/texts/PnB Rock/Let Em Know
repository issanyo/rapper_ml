[Hook: Monty and PnB Rock]
Bitch I'm livin' fast, She wanna take it slow
200 on the dash, so you know I'm close
All I get is cash, I'm on overload
Brown paper bags, neck full of gold
This for the bros, this for the hoes
Sippin' 17, she already know
When we pullin' up, it's a car show
They like Monty, Monty Imma let'em know

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Monty, let'em know
Bro you gotta let'em know
That I'm ain't like these singin' niggas
I'm the type to let'em go
Might pull on yo block just to squeeze on my phone
Might pull on yo block just to fuck on yo hoe
I pull on yo block just to snatch all your gold
Then buy me some woods from your corner store
That's just how I get it, I'm livin'
I've been chasin' money, fuck these bitches
I've been in the kitchen, water whippin'
Breakin' down the pigeons with my niggas
Hoe on the phone, then come get, I'm leanin'
Still I ain't lackin', cause I got my meaning
Watchin' for niggas and bitches that schemin'
Look at me wrong and think I'm squeezin'
You should know, bitch it PnB and ZooGang
Come thru 100D like Wu Tang
Let a nigga talk shit, we let them 2s bang
You should know, bitch it's PnB and ZooGang

[Hook: Monty and PnB Rock]
Bitch I'm livin' fast, She wanna take it slow
200 on the dash, so you know I'm close
All I get is cash, I'm on overload
Brown paper bags, neck full of gold
This for the bros, this for the hoes
Sippin' 17, she already know
When we pullin' up, it's a car show
They like Monty, Monty Imma let'em know

[Verse 2: Monty]
I'm just here to let'em know
Gotta watch these niggas cause you never know
I most the Loud Packs, she want some edibles
I just pop two, so now I feel incredible
She said Monty, try to fit me in your schedule
I be smokin' sticky-icky on the regular
I got way too many numbers in my cellular
All this ice got it feelin' like it's February
Monty, yo I got this
Let me see you topless
They ain't really got shit
Shorty lookin' tropic
PnB and ZooGang
We gon' let the two bang like:
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop

[Hook: Monty and PnB Rock]
Bitch I'm livin' fast, She wanna take it slow
200 on the dash, so you know I'm close
All I get is cash, I'm on overload
Brown paper bags, neck full of gold
This for the bros, this for the hoes
Sippin' 17, she already know
When we pullin' up, it's a car show
They like Monty, Monty Imma let'em know

[Outro: PnB Rock]
You wanna take it slow
