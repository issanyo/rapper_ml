[Intro]
I might just ice out her wrist
Yeah
(yeah) Yeah
(yeah) Yeah

[Chorus]
I got a lil bitch and she lit
I just might ice out her wrist
She like designer and shit
Like Dolce Gabbana and shit
And she stay in Cali, flew her out Miami
She a bad lil shawty, I make her call me daddy
I got a lil bitch and she lit
I just might ice out her wrist
She like designer and shit
Like Dolce Gabbana and shit
And she stay in Cali, flew her out Miami
She a bad lil shawty, I make her call me daddy

[Verse 1]
I got a new bitch (yeah)
Yeah she so lit (yeah)
Shawty the shit (yeah)
She so bad and she fucking know it
I just might cop her a whip, I just might buy her a crib
Put diamonds all on her wrist
If that what she want she can get it
I just might let her wear my chain
I just might let her meet my gang
As long as she keep it a hunnit
You loyal and just stay the same
I just might box you up and put you on the winning team
You can have all these bands on you
While I got all these bands on me
Oh, come roll with me
Yeah, come roll with me
Why you don't come smoke with me
We can fuck til we go to sleep
Yeah, you know wassup
Just give me all your trust
Don't give that pussy up
Just give me all your love

[Chorus]
I got a lil bitch and she lit
I just might ice out her wrist
She like designer and shit
Like Dolce Gabbana and shit
And she stay in Cali, flew her out Miami
She a bad lil shawty, I make her call me daddy
I got a lil bitch and she lit
I just might ice out her wrist
She like designer and shit
Like Dolce Gabbana and shit
And she stay in Cali, flew her out Miami
She a bad lil shawty, I make her call me daddy
