Lyrics from snippet

[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh-oh-oh
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & XXXTENTACION]
Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house
(Bitch!) Ooh, thirties out (Yeah)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Whoa, damn)
Yeah, going round the city, I swear I'm lurking out (Out)
Huh, damn, why use syrup off a Percy now?
Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow him down

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
So much cash, in my jeans
