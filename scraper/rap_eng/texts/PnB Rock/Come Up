[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 1: Hollowman]
Stay down ‘til I come up
Always tryna stay one up
Mini K hold fifty in it
Case a nigga wanna run up
Sundown to the sun up
I don’t ever put my gun up
I don’t ever put my gun down
Only when I pick my son up
Turn it up for my whole team
I’m a everyday rapper
No time for a fuck nigga
No time for a heifer, oh
Now you niggas wanna claim hoes
Man, then you shoulda kept her
I’ma fuck her with her clothes on
I’ma hit her on the dresser
They go left with it, I go right with it
Nigga never been a stepper
These hoes seasonal
They bring salt to the game, nigga I’ma bring pepper
Stay down ‘til I get right
Long days and the quick nights
Loud pack with the thick Sprite
Bad ho that eat the dick right

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stayin’ down ‘til our come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
You know I can’t fuck around, nah
And I can’t trust these bitches, they won’t be my downfall
And I can’t trust these niggas, it could be a mid dog
See you gettin’ paid but they start hating, takin’ it all
But I can’t go like that (hell nah)
Said I can’t go like that (hell nah)
Can’t play with my life, you can’t play with my family
Can’t play with my dough like that (hell nah)
‘Cause that’s when shit get real
And don’t make me have to kill ya
‘Cause I ain’t seen my daughter talk
And I ain’t made a mil yet
Out of town, stayin’ down, selling work
Watching, foxin' for the cops, my enemies and shirt
Gotta watch my body ‘cause I’m doing dirt
And I’m so paranoid, run up and you’ll get murked

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 3: RockStar]
Stuck in that trap
Forty on my lap
First one to squeeze
Niggas screamin’ Lord please
Young and reckless nigga
Never gave a fuck
Always chasing that dream
But I seem to always get stuck
Woke up one day
Said I’ma go and get it my way
Fuck a team and use yaself
Nobody cares about my wealth
Now I’m getting money
Far from looking bummy
Bitches wanna eat shrimp and steak
And rub all on my tummy
Watch my movies on TV
Tell me that they love me
But I don’t trust these hoes
All I love is this money
Still stay on go
Never break or fold
Live by that street code
Until the day I blow
I’ma

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Outro]
‘Til I come up
It’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
Fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
