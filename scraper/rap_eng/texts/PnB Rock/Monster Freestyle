[Intro]
Oh yeah
Gotta turn up one time
Turn the mic up some
Oh yeah

[Verse]
I got a main chick but I fuck around
'Cus it just ain't the time to be cuffing now
All these bitches temptations, I just knock em down
Soon as they start stalking I just block em now
Just a couple months turned my life crazy
Everybody know my name, I don't gotta say it
Funny how back then, man they tried to play me
Same hoes wanna fuck, Tryna have my babies
HaHa I'm laughing 'cus you think I'm dumb or something
Like i got amnesia, I don't remember them or something
2015 this my fucking summer
Man I'm feeling just like baby, Number 1 Stunna
PnB Rock, go download my app
It's free but if you want me on your shit I need a rack
If you catch me in your hood, best believe I'm strapped
I know I got all these haters I can't go like that
One of my songs your bitch favorite song
Niggas mad 'cus I'm on and my paper long
I ain't got no cosign I did it on my own
Tryna diss, I"m dropping shit man this ain't what you want
Rolling up dope, Smoke an once baby
That's why every time you see me, I look like I'm Asian
I Smoke more than Bob Marley, I think I'm Jamaican
Even if the cops coming, man I'm still blazing
Riding in that foreign, it go skrt skrt
I was just in the kitchen whipping work work
Before I buy a chick a chain or a fucking purse
I got a daughter named Milan and she comes first
Money on mind even in my dreams
I got all these bands busting out my jean
I got shooters that's gon' scoot, I dare you try to scheme
Never lacking, yeah they strapped with forties with them beams
Going in for a while, let me slow it down
Got the whole world listening to my sound
Yeah they talking shit when I ain't around
But when I pop up they don't make a sound
Shout out to the gang, Yeah we on now
No more second guessing, It's for sure now
No more second guessing, It's for sure now
That we about to take over the world now

[Hook]
I don't need friends i just need some loyal niggas
I don't need friends I just need some loyal bitches
No, I don't need friends i just need some loyal niggas
I don't need friends, man I told you
All I need is some loyalty
And I don't no fucking enemies
Your friend can turn into your fr-enemy
And I won't let that be the end of me

[Verse 2]
Gone for a while but I'm back now
The streets been waiting for this crack now
In the cell getting mail like,"Where you at now"
I'm sick and tired of hearing all these rap clowns
You got everybody signing on the track now
Niggas tryna steal your lane and that's facts now
But they can't be me, man its PnB
I done took the wave they ain't seeing me
And just last year, Ain't nobody know me
Now i walk by, everybody joe me
Man i been balling, i feel like Ginobili
I think I'm Lebron, I Think I'm Kobe
And I can take ya girl from you in 15 seconds
Sing a little Instagram clip and we sexing
I don't even gotta call, I can just text it
Tell her where I'm at and she gon' come and get naked
I'm screaming fuck the law, I hate the law
That's why every single day, I break the law
And I'm rapped out, unless its cake involved
Don't give me what I want, Ima take it all
And that's one for all them real fucking rappers
I'm not a star 'cus that's rats spelled back words
Before all this rap shit i saw a trapper
I hanged with killers, drug dealers, kidnappers
