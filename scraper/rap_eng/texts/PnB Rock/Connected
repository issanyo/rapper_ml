[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
She said, "Take me on a plane with you"
And it don't really matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
Plus I know that you can teach me a thing or two
Connected
She already know I'm connected
I'm the only one she wanna mess with
'Cause she know my whole squad is connected, connected

[Verse 1: Victor Oladipo]
She was like, "Where you heading next? You be in and out, yeah"
I know you be bored when you out of town, yeah
If you ever need some company, yeah
You know I'ma vibe, so call on me and I'll be there
I'll be there in a hurry
She know with me, it never be no worries
So I say shoot the name and the b-day
That quick, she was on the 405 freeway

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
She said, "Take me on a plane with you"
And it don't really matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
Plus I know that you can teach me a thing or two
Connected
She already know I'm connected
I'm the only one she wanna mess with
'Cause she know my whole squad is connected, connected

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
She said, "Take me on a plane with you"
("Where you heading next? You be in and out")
And it don't really matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
(I know you be bored when you out of town)
Plus I know that you can teach me a thing or two
Connected
She already know I'm connected
I'm the only one she wanna mess with
'Cause she know my whole squad is connected, connected

[Verse 2: Victor Oladipo]
We can hang at the crib, but there's something 'bout a five-star suite
Leave the covers on the floor, housekeeper make that up for me (Yeah)
You should meet me in Rome, Paris, or maybe Germany
Have some fettuccine down in Italy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
She said, "Take me on a plane with you" (Take me on a plane)
And it don't really matter where we headed
