[Verse 1]
Aye
Bad lil shawty she from New York city, aye
Met at my show she was supper pretty, aye
Got her number text her like you should get with me, aye
She said send a uber and she gon get wit me
She came with some of her friends
They linked with some of my friends
We smoked we got high
Caught each others vibe
We chilled and we rolled up again
Said she wanna be a dancer and she wanna be a actress
I said she can have it all, just as long as I can have her, yea

[Pre-Hook]
Girl you know you the one
And I can't even lie
A nigga play if he wants
When it come to you I would die
Yea I know we just met
But I swear I got a better side
I don't wanna fall in love
But fuck it tho we can try it
Yea uhhh
Fuck it tho we can try it
Yeahh ohhh ohhh

[Hook]
Maybe we should try it
Don't you be so silent
We can see just where it goes x2
Maybe we should try it
Don't you be so silent
And we can see how far it goes
We can see how far it goes

[Verse 2]
Don't be shy let it be
Shawty I got what you need
I usually don't be on no cuffing shit
But girl you got me on some other shit
You got all these bitches hating
Cause I'm the one that they be chasing
I can stare at you no blanket
Let me change your situation
Shawty don't play cause I got you
I'm like 6'2 you like 5'2
It ain't never hard for me to spot you
Hit the bape store you know I shop for you
Don't trip cause I got you
I'm like 6'2 you like 5'2
It ain't never hard for me to spot you
Hit the bape store you know I shop for you

[Pre-Hook]
And girl you know you the one
And I can't even lie
A nigga play if he wants
When it comes to you I would die
Yea I know we just met
But I swear I got a better side
I don't wanna fall in love
But fuck it tho we can try it
Fuck it tho we can try it x2
Ouuu ouuuu

[Hook]
Maybe we should try it
Don't you be so silent
We can see just where it goes x2
Maybe we should try it
Don't you be so silent
We can see how far it goes x2
