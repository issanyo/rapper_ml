[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
Banging all the dough, that's that unlimited
Yeah I got stacks, girl you know I'm with the shit
Yeah I blow packs, girls unlimited
You ain't gotta ask girl you know I'm with the shit
Dope backpack on everyday
Go back no unlimited
Yeah I blow stacks, girls unlimited
I ain't gotta ask girl I know you with the shit

[Verse 1: CA$HPASSION]
Girl you with the shit
Girl I'm with the shit (Yeah, Yeah)
It's evident, you and me the perfect fit
Breaking down the switch up
Girl you with the shit
Counting my money, she watching for the pigs
Mother fuck paper, real one it ain't here
You want the better things in life you gotta take risks
Are you down to whip it for me baby for some change
Are you down to flip it for me baby lets get rich

[Bridge: CA$HPASSION]
You say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit
If I say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit

[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
Banging all the dough, that's that unlimited
Yeah I got stacks, girl you know I'm with the shit
Yeah I blow packs, girls unlimited
You ain't gotta ask girl you know I'm with the shit
Dope backpack on everyday
Go back no unlimited
Yeah I blow stacks, girls unlimited
I ain't gotta ask girl I know you with the shit

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Shawty where you come from
This was not expected
All the night flexin'
All the night sexin'
Fuckin' all these hoes
Smokin' all this dope
Rockin' all designer
Trappin' off the phone
I got it so bad for you
I get all in my bag with you
Hit the mall blow a bag with you
Put it all in my tab for you
Cause I got it so bad for you
You don't give me no attitude
I can't never get mad at you
Look at all of that ass on you

[Bridge 2: PnB Rock]
I'm all in, no talkin', I'mma show you now
I can tell that you love when I come around
We get high and we vibe till the sun goes down
So I promise now, let me hold you down

[Bridge: CA$HPASSION]
You say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit
If I say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit

[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
Banging all the dough, that's that unlimited
Yeah I got stacks, girl you know I'm with the shit
Yeah I blow packs, girls unlimited
You ain't gotta ask girl you know I'm with the shit
Dope backpack on everyday
Go back no unlimited
Yeah I blow stacks, girls unlimited
I ain't gotta ask girl I know you with the shit

[Bridge: CA$HPASSION]
You say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit
If I say I'm going in
You know I'm going
You know I get it
There ain't no limit
