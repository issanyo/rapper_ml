[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Everything okay
I think I found my new bae
In the city where she stay
She look like she from L.A.
I might hit her with this work
Make her feel like I'm her first
I might put her in a vert
I might buy her a new purse

[Post-Chorus: PnB Rock & Roy Woods]
Shawty, she open (yeah)
Shawty, she open
Shawty, she open
I got her soakin' (damn)
I got her soakin'
I got her soakin'
Girl, don't you play with me (skrt skrt)
Girl, just come stay with me (yeah)
Girl, won't you lay with me? (yeah)
We could just stay lowkey (yeah)
We could just stay lowkey
Ain't nobody gotta know
We could creep off in a Ghost
Backseats, curtain closed
I let you roll up my dope
It's crazy, you don't even smoke
Woahh, do your thing!

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
She say, "Roy, why you always rollin' the backwoods up?" (why)
Why do I do things? Understand that I'm a different kind (understand me)
You wanna stunt, I'll get you anything that you need
Girl, you a boss, they don't know 'bout the place that you came from (came from)
Do's this all night and day like Adrian Peterson
I changed you, 'cause I dun know you not no greedy girl
Don't pop bands, but I pop Xans
Don't roll blunts, said, "Fuck friends!"
Go grind for yourself, get your own bands
Done fightin' like, "Why you again? Why you again?"

[Chorus: PnB Rock & (Roy Woods)]
Everything okay (okay)
I think I found my new bae (new bae)
In the city where she stay
She look like she from L.A. (L.A.)
I might hit her with this work (work)
Make her feel like I'm her first (first)
I might put her in a vert
I might buy her a new purse

[Post-Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, she open (yeah)
Shawty, she open
Shawty, she open
I got her soakin' (damn)
I got her soakin'
I got her soakin'
Girl, don't you play with me (skrt skrt)
Girl, just come stay with me (yeah)
Girl, won't you lay with me? (yeah)
We could just stay lowkey

[Verse 2: 24hrs & (PnB Rock)]
"Aye, Twenty, I call no pick up
I hope that you never switch up" (damn)
Of course you get that brand new Gucci (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, ooh)
Pussy wet and I'ma swim in it (yeah, right)
Damn, Twenty move just like the president
Fuck, countin' blue faces in my new ride (bands, bands, bands)
I get Fendi and the big shots (big pimpin', pimpin', pimpin')
I got it tinted 'cause they know me
Lately, I've been movin' lowkey (lowkey)
Yeah, you're my baby just like Jodye (like Jodye)
Aye, Twenty, I heard you with PnB (yeah)
And you got Roy with you

[Chorus: PnB Rock & (Roy Woods)]
Everything okay (okay)
