Hook (PNB Rock)
I’m just riding ‘round town with this new pistol
Cause I don’t fuck with niggas like I used to do
When you roll, don’t nobody wanna fuck with you
When you up, man they wanna turn up with you
That’s why I got trust issues, I got trust issues
I got trust issues, I got trust issues
Nigga I got trust issues, I got trust issues
I got trust issues, I got trust issues

Verse 1 (Yakki Divioshi)
The hate is so real out here
I know how they feel out here
See they keep this low on my wrist
My neck, they might try to kill out here
Cause niggas be merkin’ over nothin’
Claim that they robbin’ but they bluffin’
I keep that choppa with me, Waka Flocka with me
Blocka blocka with me, like oh oh
My favorite creation the stove
Cause I come from whippin’ them bowls
Sellin’ them bowls, sippin’ on flows
She wear my clothes, it’s just me and my bros
We can get it, ‘head read between the lines
Had to serve without no vision, now you blind
Niggas cross me, then I wouldn’t even be surprised
Cause I can see the envy in they eyes
Niggas hatin’ cause they tell me they gon’ ride for me
All the niggas that diss me, wanna ride for me
The loyal niggas that be whippin’ they gone ride for me
What nigga gone get locked up and do time for me

Verse 2 (PnB Rock)
The hate is so real out here
I know how they feel out here
It’s all in they faces, they hate that I made it
Want me to get killed out here
So I’m ridin’ ‘round the city strapped up by my lonely
I ain’t got no license but I still got it on me
Cops ever try to pull me over I ain’t doin’ it
We can get into a shootout early in the morning
Don’t give a fuck, nigga this the life I’m living
Came from the slumps, I was raised in the trenches
Gotta watch these hoes, even gotta watch my niggas
No, I can’t trust a soul, that’s why I got trust issues
You ain’t one hundred, just know I don’t fuck with you
You ain’t in my gang, I can’t bust a jugg with you
And it be the ones, that you thought had love for you
Be the same ones that’ll tell a judge on you
