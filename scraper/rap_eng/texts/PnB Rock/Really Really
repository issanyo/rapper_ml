[Hook: PnB Rock]
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Killin' all these niggas, I ain't even tryin'
They ask me if I'm strapped, I say really really
They ask me do I trap, I say really really
Flexin' till the world end, yeah we be ballin'
Better get your girlfriend cause she keep callin'
They ask me am I high, I say really really
Do I be on my grind? I say really really

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
In my Robin jeans I be really flyin'
Problem with my green then they really dyin'
If he try ZooGang then Zoovier gon' fry him
Run up from the front, criminals right behind him
And you don't want these problems nigga
Talkin' bread but you don't got none nigga
I'm the ZooGod, I will not run nigga
This is flex man, this no lie
Roll a backwood, I stay high

[Hook: PnB Rock]
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Killin' all these niggas, I ain't even tryin'
They ask me if I'm strapped, I say really really
They ask me do I trap, I say really really
Flexin' till the world end, yeah we be ballin'
Better get your girlfriend cause she keep callin'
They ask me am I high, I say really really
Do I be on my grind? I say really really

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Came through with my gang, they be really robbin'
If you came through with your chain boy you better hide it
All my niggas hitters, they be really plottin'
All these whack niggas flexin' like they got it
I don't give a fuck and I never will
Even though a nigga just signed a deal
Everyday I ride around with the steel
Cause everyday round my way, niggas get killed
Had to stack up to pay my momma's bills
In the field so I know how drama feel
You's a bitch, you don't know how drama feels
Did it on my own, give a fuck how you feel
Fuck how you feel
Now it's time to switch the flow up
Took a while to get my dough up
I ain't ever switched my rolls up
Now everywhere we go they know us
Cause this a new lane
Bitch we with ZooGang
You fuck with the gang, we lettin' it bang
I took your bitch because I know you a lame
Diamonds, they dancin' all over my chain

[Hook: PnB Rock]
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Killin' all these niggas, I ain't even tryin'
They ask me if I'm strapped, I say really really
They ask me do I trap, I say really really
Flexin' till the world end, yeah we be ballin'
Better get your girlfriend cause she keep callin'
They ask me am I high, I say really really
Do I be on my grind? I say really really
