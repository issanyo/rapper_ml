[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, oh yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
I don't understand

[Verse 1: Phat Geez]
Young nigga on the come up
They be saying, "Phat, don't rush"
Tired of all that humble shit, nigga just hush
Stuntin' on them old bitches
When they see me out, now they tryna fuck
Throwin 1's at them stripper bitches
That's fuckin' that pole up
Tickin' like a bomb, I'm 'bout to blow up (boom)
Say the strong survive, let me lower my 9
Thinkin' 'bout dollar signs, and them bad bitches standin' out in line (I see yall)
Tryna get it with me, I'm tryna fuck for free
I dont pay for shit, get some bubblegum
And some hard dick
Pull up on em make em car sick
Y'all gon' take caution, put you in a coffin
When they was ballin', we was walkin'
So what you was talkin'?
I say "I do" to the game
I wanted the money, the bitches, the power, the fame

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
I don't understand

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I don't really understand
Why the fuck they think they know me, where the fuck was them?
When I was trappin' in the mud, I was comin' up
In the kitchen baggin' up, sellin' [?] for [?]
They just see that I'm on now, actin' like I ain't run to get it
Started from the bottom, now I'm in designer fuckin' all these model bitches
Same hoes that turned me down, nowadays they wanna fuck
And every time I swat around, hatin' niggas they envy us
We on know, we won nigga
Fuckin' right, I'm the one nigga
I put my whole team on, now it's a bunch of rich young niggas
And we killin' the game, my niggas is real, these niggas is lame
It's PnB, they gon' remember the name

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
All they really see is the money and the fame
Foreigns I be drivin' and the diamonds in my chain
They don't understand, I been through some things
Lotta trials and tribulations, bitch I can't even explain
So I'ma go hard 'til I can't no more
I'ma get money 'til I can't no more
I'ma live it up 'til I can't no more
Turn up, turn up 'til I can't no more
I don't understand
