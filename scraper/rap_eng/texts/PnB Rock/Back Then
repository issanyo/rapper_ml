[Intro]
Aww yeah
From then to now

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to take over the game, I done made my own lane
I ain't even gotta say it, everybody know my name
Still gettin' used to the fame, everything so different now
Can't walk to the store without takin' no pictures now
Got love for my fans, they really held me down
I was locked up in a cell, every day they sent me mail
They love me, I can tell, feels good, I made it
Now it's time to turn up for all the niggas that hated
PnB, that's my crew, told my mama, "I got you"
Funny how I'm hittin' hoes that ain't want me in high school
'Cause I'm rollin' now, yeah they know I'm rollin' now
And my money, can't fold it now, I done came up

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now

[Verse 2]
Yeah I've been ballin' with my bros, I've been fuckin' all these hoes
I've been switchin' up my cars like I'm switchin' up my clothes
Smokin' all this dope, got your bitch faded
Damn it feels good to finally say I made it
Cashin' all these checks, put new diamonds all in my neck
Bought a chain for my daughter just to show her how to flex
Got now, fuck next, every day I'm ballin'
Just changed my number, label still callin'
Feelin' like Mike Jones 'cause back then they ain't want me
But now I'm on and all them hoes, they all on me
'Cause they know I'm rollin' now, and it is beginnin' now
Y'all hoes like different now, I done came up

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
