[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Diamonds on me and they on fleek
That bitch wanna fuck me 'cause she know I'm PnB
Rollie on me and that bitch on fleek
Shorty in my face 'cause it's diamonds in my teeth
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
She wanna fuck me in my Guccis
I'm telling her everything Gucci
Lil shorty gon' act like she knows me
She don't know me, she just knew me
Base
I'll take her right to 3rd base
Youngin' be caught in mistakes
Shorty tells me she relates
I like fucking shorty face
Girl can you hang 'round my playground
Used to party in the basement
You can't play me like a Playstation
Told my baby I'm not far away
You can call on me whenever niggas feel ya
Met little shorty on the [?] when the sun set
Bitch I'm with PnB Rock and you brought your best friend

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Diamonds on me and they on fleek
That bitch wanna fuck me 'cause she know I'm PnB
Rollie on me and that bitch on fleek
Shorty in my face 'cause it's diamonds in my teeth
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me

[Verse 2: Dice SoHo]
None of my bitches give me attitudes
Young nigga, I did what I had to do
5 percent tint and I'm at the [?]
[?] when I'm talkin' money [?]
So where the hoes
You already know I got bitches at the do'
Bitches snortin' on the flo'
Walk inside the sto' I don't ever ask about the total
Gotta switch phones 'cause the feds tappin' on my mobile
Rollie iceberg
20K that's light work
If your nigga blew that in a day his pockets might hurt
She just wanna know if we got the drugs
She wanna give me a hug, I told that bitch to go down on the rug
Fuck that bitch out of her Uggs

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Diamonds on me and they on fleek
That bitch wanna fuck me 'cause she know I'm PnB
Rollie on me and that bitch on fleek
Shorty in my face 'cause it's diamonds in my teeth
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me
'Cause these VVs, all on me
Shorty be stalking me
Calling me
