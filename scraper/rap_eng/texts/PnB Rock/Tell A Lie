[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
All that fuckin’ lying ain’t good for your health
Always frontin’, boy you drawing, just go kill yourself
I’m steady chasin’ pesos, your bitch want a nigga
‘Cause she says you fake and I’m one hundred nigga
Cash on me right now, got your stash on me right now
You can act crazy all you want
Wiley got the MAC on him right now
And he squeezin’ off, better get to duckin’
I could get you off, nigga it ain’t nothin’
Smokin’ on dope, I’m so high today
I can smell that money from a mile away
You think you gon’ stop my shine
Nigga not today
If your shit hotter than mine, well this what I’ma say

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie

[Verse 2: RockStar]
We mobbin’ and we rollin’
We mobbin’ and we rollin’
Your Instagram a lie
Them red bottoms don’t bleed
Fake niggas ain’t ‘bout this life
Let me tell you how I see it
Take you to that empty disc, put you on abandoned [?]
I can tell a lie, from a mile away
Fuck around with me, you gon’ die today
Them blocks you got ain’t jumping
Them choppers you ain’t chopping
Them rocks you ain’t rocking
And them hoes you sure ain’t popping
Can see it in your eyes, don’t look surprised
Come through your block, singing all [?]
Let me show you how I get to it
Get the trap active jumpin’
Poppin’ bands on these hoes
You know I stay stuntin’

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie
From a mile away
Fuckin’ ‘round with me, you must want die today
Don’t fuck with my paper or my squad
Cause when it come down to that shit I’ma ride
You know I can tell a lie
