[Hook]
I been doing shows all week
I been selling O'z all week
I ain't even change my clothes all week
I just need a bitch to roll my weed
I been in the trap all week
I been filling up these packs all week
I been making all these racks all week
Now I need a bitch to roll my weed

[Verse 1]
Where you at? Girl I got a sack
I don't smoke no whack
Girl you know I got that pack
Tryna smoke up on this loud
While I hit it from the back
Shawty is you into that?
Tell me is you into that, ayy
Ain't gotta lie, is you with it or not
No I ain't tryna flex, girl, I'm PnB Rock
I might slide thru your hood
Pick you up in a drop
Make your friend count this gwap
And make you give me top, ayy
I just need a bad bitch to roll my weed up
I'm just tryna fall back and put my feet up
Man, if she can do that then she a keeper
But if she can't do that then I don't need her

[Hook]
Cause I been doing shows all week
I been selling O'z all week
I ain't even change my clothes all week
I just need a bitch to roll my weed
I been in the trap all week
I been filling up these packs all week
I been making all these racks all week
Now I need a bitch to roll my weed

[Verse 2]
Roll it up, roll it up
I'm glad that you called cause that lean had me stuck
I almost forgot that I had to whip up
Now I just left the trap
Got finished baggin' up
Where you at girl, wassup?
Let me know now
I been trappin', sellin' work on the low now
So they keep calling me for them O'z now
But instead I'm here with you tryna blow it down
Yeah, I just need a bad bitch to roll my weed up
I'm just tryna fall back and put my feet up
If she can't do that then I don't need her
But if she can do that then I'ma keep her

[Hook]
I been doing shows all week
I been selling O'z all week

Now I need a bitch to roll my weed

[Outro]
Roll it up, roll it up
Roll it up, roll it up
Roll it up, roll it up
Roll it up, roll it up
