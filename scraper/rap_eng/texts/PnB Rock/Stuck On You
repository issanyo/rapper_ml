[Chorus: Daniel]
They just wanna tear us apart
But I’m stuck on you (you oh)
Everybody talks, they can say what they want
I’m still stuck on you (you oh)
Baby you been running through my mind all day
Come through girl we got a lot of time to waste
Don’t matter how many girls in my phone
I’m still stuck on you

[Verse 1: Daniel]
Never keep you on the low
I need everyone to know
Curving one day in my phone
Yeah they be doing the most
I don’t give ‘em no play
Come around my way
Been on my mind all day
All I need to say, ayeeee
(No) they can’t take your place
(Oh) I tell ‘em to wait
(No) need to conversate
(Oh) don’t you know they, they

[Chorus: Daniel]
They just wanna tear us apart
But I’m stuck on you (you oh)
Everybody talks, they can say what they want
I’m still stuck on you (you oh)
Baby you been running through my mind all day
Come through girl we got a lot of time to waste
Don’t matter how many girls in my phone
I’m still stuck on you (you oh)
