[Intro: Pnb Rock]
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Oh Yeah , Oh Yeah
Yeah , Yeah

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone

[Verse 1: Pnb Rock]
Dumping wood, sipping lean
Thirteen-hunnit' Balmains
I been living like a savage
Pussy stains on my jeans
I'm that nigga on the low
You ain't know? Now you know
Twenty bands, one show
I did that shit on my own
I been really in my zone lately, I been really in my zone lately
These bitches keep calling my phone
I gave her the dick now she going crazy
Ever since that I got on, everybody wanna know how I'm doing lately
Where the fuck was they when I was going crazy?
I was broke, I ain't have me no home, baby
Now everyday I buy new clothes and everyday I smoke two O's
And after every one of my shows, I fuck like one or two hoes
I just might go cop a fern, I just might go buy me a hoe
I winning, I'm feeling like Diddy now
Might fuck around and buy me a boat

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
My money too long can't fall nigga
Try running from the plug, you got the wrong nigga
I been riding round' the city with a chopper
And some lean, I don't serve by the knot
He don't know I'ma bout' to buy her a Birkin bag
In the kitchen, with the pigeons
Give the birds a bath
That pussy too good, I'ma dab it
I'ma swerve, straight to curb in a new Bentley
I was broke back then had to run it up
Still trapping out the bando, no furniture
I'm about to get some money and I feel it
Young rich nigga living like Diddy

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone
