[Hook: PnB Roc]
No, you ain't my girl, but you my ride or die
Fuck titles and all of that, cause I know I'm your's and you're mine
We been through some real shit, most of my hardest times
When I sit back and think about it, you was by my side

[Verse 1: PnB Roc]
Yeah, you took my work when I ran off, stashed the gun when I robbed that man
You was there for my worst crimes, you never thought about taking a stick
Loyallity is everything, and you loyal, girl, at least to your man
You was there to get me out of every jam, took care of me when I was in the can
And if a nigga ever crossed the line, my shaudy make sure he gotta die
Cause I don't play round when it come to mine
Girl, I'll hold it down for you, I kill a nigga down for you
And I know you would do the same for me
And I know you don't play no games with me
You gonna make sure I'm always cool
And I know you gonna hold it down for me

[Verse 2: Lee Mazin]
Never thought we'd get this far, you up on the block
The cops on your top, you come and take my car
Stash spot while you wippin it
Crash it up, I know you fixing it
Baking soda, I'm mixing it
Late nights when you kissing it
Then you hug me all like I been missing you
We gonna tigh the not, but ain't no rushing it
And them boys knocking at my door, I'm flushing it
And my girls say he goin do you wrong
I ain't trusting it
Cause now we here, we going strong, and no lucking it
That's love, that's trust, that's loyalty, we fus
We fight and fuck, then we good
Then he say pull the trigger, I do it
And I know if I get in trouble, he'll come running
And I'll never turn my back on him

[Hook: PnB Roc]
No, you ain't my girl, but you my ride or die
Fuck titles and all of that, cause I know I'm your's and you're mine
We been through some real shit, most of my hardest times
When I sit back and think about it, you was by my side
