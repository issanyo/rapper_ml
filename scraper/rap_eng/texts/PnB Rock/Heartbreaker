[Intro: PnB Rock]
She really don't care
Oh yeah
Ooh!

[Chorus: PnB Rock and Watts]
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there

[Verse 1: Watts]
She got a man, but she's going out with me though
It's fucked up because I'm still working on me though
It's so confusing
We both choosing
She got a text late night, like "where you been?"
And she really don't care
She turned the phone off and whispered in my ear
She said I really love him, but like you though
That's the reason why I rather be here

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
She said she would rather be here
She know I got the drinks and the weed here
And she know I would never judge her
So she don't feel guilty when she leave here
When she with me she don't want to be disturbed
So she put her phone on "do not disturb"
She just young and free steady out here doing dirt
But she know that I'm a real one and I won't say a word

[Chorus: PnB Rock and Watts]
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there

[Refrain: PnB Rock]
He gon' kill you when he finds out
It's only a matter of time 'til he finds out
'Cause you keep spending nights out
And you keep booking flights out
And you keep bringing bags home
He knows somethings going on

[Verse 3: Watts]
He came in he front then I walked out the back
So why I never trust a girl
Why I never love a girl
Said you love him what the fuck's up with that
He caught us under covers girl, said I was your brother girl (aw)
She really don't care (don't care)
She really don't care (don't care)
She really don't care (don't care)
She really don't care

[Refrain: PnB Rock]
He gon' kill you when he finds out
It's only a matter of time 'til he finds out
'Cause you keep spending nights out
You keep booking flights out
You keep bringing bags home
He knows somethings going on

[Chorus: PnB Rock and Watts]
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there
Said she got a man, but she really don't care (she don't care)
Plus she was in love, but it really ain't there (it ain't there)
Now she wanna drink (yeah)
She just wanna smoke (yeah)
She just wanna fuck and she really don't care
She a heartbreaker
And it really ain't fair
Man that girl really don't care
She got a man coming home on a work night
Showed up and she wasn't even there

[Outro: PnB Rock]
She wasn't even there
Yeah, that bitch wasn't even there
That's why I don't trust these hoes
Fuck 'em (oh!)
