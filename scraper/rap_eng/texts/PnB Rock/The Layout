[Hook]
Don't you act like you don't miss the old times
And I don't ever cross your mind
Don't act like you just don't care
Don't you act like you don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had, all those good ol times we shared
Don't you act

[Verse 1]

I'm listening to the chatter
You going through shit with your bitch
Missing old shit picking up on her pattern
But really it doesn't matter
Cause all she really wants is a little conversation
Followed by dick and a platter
But somewhere down the line a nigga will start
To switch up, on his main chick
And go hit another bitch up
DAMN
You ain't gon' fuck but
Guaranteed you'll get ya dick sucked
And go back to your chick
And give her that look like its just us
But shit it just was
I guess that's over with and then she
Rather stand alone, watch how cold it get
We know that love is a drug and once that's over with
Then she comes down from the high and starts noticing
(Ha)

She want to settle the score and fuck that nigga
That she like but she was never a whore
But her boyfriend in the booth steady stressing
And surely he gon' put them beats on mic check and record
She  blowing up his phone cause she want to see him
Even though she finally see's that she don't need him
Last chance just to stick to the plan
And keep her home and not with that fuck nigga instead
(Uhn)
She know she wrong in the back of head
But every time she think of him
She can't forget what he did
Her body yarns for the dick and she mad
So she gon hit that nigga up so he can give her some head
But ain't no stopping him and ain't no stopping her
He gon lick her for a half and then he popping her
And fuck a contraceptive
Lusting for love and she gon' learn her lesson
Gave her a baby and a bad infection
Its sickening

I'm just trying to paint a vivid picture
Of people acting on impulse
But I finally get it
Defensive mechanisms put up cause she never listens
Cloaking emotions cause you get hurt when your heart is open
Known that love is a burden and your losing focus
On goals that you was hoping you'd achieve
So who believes in this fairy tale
Live in a perfect world
With a perfect job
And a perfect girl
In a perfect house
White picket fence
The red shutters on the windows
But its covering the pain and uncertainty
So i laugh
Its a vicious habit, but it actually
Seems to work for me
Damn

Months pass and she stuck in a jam
And y'all saying that this nigga should've
Stuck with her?, man
He was trying to chase his dreams had to stick to the plan
But all of this because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants
But ain't it funny how it play out
Open your eyes and you'll realize
That you built your home on real lies

Only way to change the layout
Is to break down and rebuild it because you grown
And now you know what it takes now

[Hook]
Don't you act like you don't miss the old times
And I don't ever cross your mind
Don't act like you just don't care
Don't you act like you don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had, all those good ol times we shared
Don't you act

[Verse 2]
Getting money now I'm feeling
Better
The snakes chasing the rats
Rats chasing the cheddar
And best believe they watching you
Cause when you focused it's only one way
They stopping you
I saw this nigga at the corner store
Copping dutches, drunk as shit strapped down
So I'm thinking fuck it
I'm a run up in his crib while he falling back
And when he hand over the cash
Then I'm gon' bust it
I put the strap in this nigga face
Like I'm a bust my gun if you don't
Point me to the fucking safe
This nigga bitching and stuttering like he
Innocent, he been a bitch
But he don't know who he dealing with
That inner anger you ain't taming nigga I am dangerous
Hit him once and that pussy
Would've probably made it
He looked up at me knowing he about to leave
Hopefully seeing if I would show him some sympathy
And he said " I ain't did shit cous' "
But you wrong cause you stole the only thing that I loved
You turned my wife into a hoe
Thinking I'll let it go
But the people with the most pain
Will never let it show
And you try to hold it in but all it's doing is grow
Trying to deal with the stress
But eventually gonna blow
I'm a put my strap down
And I had to let you know that
I'm going to let you live cause
You going to always be my
"bro"

[Hook]
Don't you act like you don't miss the old times
And I don't ever cross your mind
Don't act like you just don't care
Don't you act like you don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had, all those good ol times we shared
Don't you act
