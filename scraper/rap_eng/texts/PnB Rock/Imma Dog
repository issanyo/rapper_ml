[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
You say you always gon' be by my side
You say you trust me with your heart and I swear, I just wonder why
Say "I'm done with this," you tell me "Don't go"
Shawty, I ain't tryna hurt you no more
But you say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die

[Verse: Ugly God]
I be up, I'm a go-getter
What I'm doin', baby, no tellin'
You the shit, you can do so better
But I'm a dog, you should have known better
Like why the fuck you love me? huh
I be gone for weeks, why the fuck you trust me, huh
I sneak out while you sleep, why the fuck you cuff me, huh
Like what the fuck you think, you act like a dummy, huh
Ayy, you catch me slippin' every time, I know it hurt
I been out, I know you smell it on my shirt
I'm a dog, but I want this shit to work
But I'm tryna fuck on every bitch that's tryna flirt

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
You say you always gon' be by my side
You say you trust me with your heart and I swear, I just wonder why
Say "I'm done with this," you tell me "Don't go"
Shawty, I ain't tryna hurt you no more
But you say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die

[Outro: Ugly God]
Ayy, 'cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
Mm, 'cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
