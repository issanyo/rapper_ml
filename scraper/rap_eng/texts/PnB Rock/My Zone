[Verse 1]
You gettin’ on my fuckin’ nerves
You keep callin’ my phone
I’m rolling off these thirties
And you fuckin’ up my zone
I ain’t answer so you textin’ me then you stalkin’ all my home
Dude this jive bitch is crazy, somebody three-oh-two this ho

[Chorus]
I just don’t fucking get it
Bitch tell me why you trippin’
Told you I just wanna hit it
Fucked you and now I’m tryna fuck your friend
But now you fuckin’ up my zone, zone
What up with you, I got you gone, gone
I said this shit before but I’ma make it clear right here
Seem like what I say goes in one and come right out the other ear, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Fuckin’ up my high
Bitch I’m ‘bout to change my number
It’s the truth, I don’t tell no lies
Sorry I just don’t want you
So why you keep on texting me and calling me
And stalking me, you drawing
I ain’t your man, girl what the fuck is you doin’?

[Chorus]
I just don’t fucking get it
Bitch tell me why you trippin’
Told you I just wanna hit it
Fucked you and now I’m ‘bout to fuck your friend
But girl you fuckin’ up my zone, zone
What up with you, I got you gone, gone
I said this shit before but I’ma make it clear here
Seem like what I say goes and one did come right out the other ear, oh yeah
Fuckin’ up my zone, zone
What up with you, I got you gone, gone
I said this shit before but I’ma make it clear here
Seem like what I say goes and one did come right out the other ear, oh yeah
Oh yeah
