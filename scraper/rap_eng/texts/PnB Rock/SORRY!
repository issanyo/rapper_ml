Mixing up the lean with the Fanta
You don't want smoke, I'm cancer

Nigga you just mad cause I'm popping
You just dropped a tape, that shit flopping
All you little bitches want money
I just dropped a xan in the cup, I'm sorry
Too turnt up for the party
Just off the motherfucking stage of a party, little bitch

You a fucking fan bro
These my fucking fam hoe
You wasn't raised in the field, hoe
