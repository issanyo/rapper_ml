[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Rock
Talk that work shit, with Dave East
Fuck these niggas talkin' about?
Whoo

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams
Tell my OG remix it, now I'm making bands
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Baby bottle jar, baking soda and a couple bowls
It don't even matter, microwave or the fuckin' stove
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Leash and T came up on some work and they brought it to my attention
Like, "Rock, do you know how to cook it?"
I said, "Fuck no, but let's go to the kitchen." (ooh)
We went to the kitchen and I got to whippin' and whippin' and whippin' 'til it disappeared
I was like, "Oh!", T was like, "Bro!", and Leash was like, "Damn! What the fuck you done did?"
I don't know but let me call my plug (Brrr, Brrr)
He came and remixed the work
He bought that shit back, I made a power pack and I took it [?]
Trap phone jumping like Jordan
Let me tell you 'bout my young nigga Joy
He be OT, movin' work low key, always call me like, "Fuck, I need more shit."
Trap phone jumpin' like D. Rose
[?] keep callin' me the hero
Niggas keep talkin' that work shit
Get booked, start singin' like mingo
I whip it so good, my wrist got the cramps
I will take change, I even take stamps
I'm whippin' and whippin' and breakin' it down
Whippin' and whippin' and breakin' it down

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams
Tell my OG remix it, now I'm making bands
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Baby bottle jar, baking soda and a couple bowls
It don't even matter, microwave or the fuckin' stove
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Nigga I can show you how to whip it
My cousin Booster went and showed me about this crippin'
I'm sippin' juice, it got a nigga feelin' different (lean)
Little B up in the kitchen water whippin'
My nigga Rock said he came up on the block
36 oz, we can put it in a pot
When that money come in, that's when niggas start to plot
Standin' in the kitchen with a smoker and a Glock
Runnin' out of baking soda, hit it with the ice
Whip it with a knife, zombies outside all night
Slept in the trap, wake up first I check my phone
You could make a livin' off white
Blanco, but the color off-white
[?] was the best
Powder all over the livin' room
Call Keyshia, come clean up this mess
I done seen it happen to the best
I was never blind to it, no Ray Charles
[?]
I know your pops, he just called us for an 8 bar
Put it on my tongue, I can taste raw (mmm)
For the love of a brick, I ain't lovin' no chick
Here's some coke, sniff your face off

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams
Tell my OG remix it, now I'm making bands
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Baby bottle jar, baking soda and a couple bowls
It don't even matter, microwave or the fuckin' stove
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
