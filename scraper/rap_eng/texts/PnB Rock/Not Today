[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
Niggas always tryna copy yeah
Niggas tryna steal the sauce
You don't want these problems, nah
You don't wanna get involved
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I get it with my dawgs
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I did it with my dawgs
This shit crazy
Niggas they be, in the way
I'm too wavy
You can't play me, not today
This shit crazy
Niggas they be, in the way
I'm too wavy
You can't play me, not today

[Verse 1: Kur]
Yeah, I started off rapping my shit was blunt
These niggas keep jacking i switched it up
Block hot I was trapping ain't give a fuck
Poured gas in the wood bouta dump the guts
I trapped in the hood and doubled up
Some niggas was moving and now they stuck
Bitch confusing don't know what she want
I'm waking up moody it's from the drugs
The t-shirt is Gucci, I'm by the buck
This bitch must be stupid tryna line me up
I can't let a groupie bitch tie me up
Louie's is low top don't tie them up
Make a sharp left I was in the trunk
Sandwich bag full and I got it tucked
It was all cool til my flow was touched
Dished one of these off and I got back up
Used to sell tree I was in a rush
Used to hide tree that was in the bush
Head full of peas used to need a brush
Grabbed these QP's and re'ed right up
This shit is easy I'm steaming up
This shit is easy I'm steaming up
Grabbed a QP and re'ed right up (Grabbed a QP and re'ed [?])

[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
Niggas always tryna copy yeah
Niggas tryna steal the sauce
You don't want these problems, nah
You don't wanna get involved
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I get it with my dawgs
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I did it with my dawgs
This shit crazy
Niggas they be, in the way
I'm too wavy
You can't play me, not today
This shit crazy
Niggas they be, in the way
I'm too wavy
You can't play me, not today

[Verse 2: Pnb Rock]
Uhh
Aw man, not again
Niggas thinking that we friends, til' I pull up in a Benz
3 niggas with me strapped behind the tent
I bet you woke up this morning, nigga you ain't think that this would be the end
You should've never said my name
Looking for some fame, now you in the wind
Meanwhile bitch I'm still trapping, in the hood with the real action
I heard your man got killed just the other day nigga and you still lacking [?]
Niggas out here slipping fucking with these bitches, that's when shit really happen
Me? I'm still in the trenches, getting chicken like a bunk bed, I'm still stacking
Woke up in the trap, Atlantic Records on my back
If you supposed to be in the studio, why you riding round with a strap?
They don't know that I'm attached, to the fucking hood that's a fact
Smoking dope sipping act, stealing sauce get you whacked

[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
Niggas always tryna copy yeah
Niggas tryna steal the sauce
You don't want these problems, nah
You don't wanna get involved
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I get it with my dawgs
Came up from the bottom, yeah
I did it with my dawgs
This shit crazy
Niggas they be, in the way
I'm too wavy
You can't play me, not today
You can't play me, not today
