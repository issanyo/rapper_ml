[Hook 1: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Little shawty got her own and I like that
Hit the mall, she ain't worried 'bout a price tag
She got all these niggas out here tryna wife that
And a lil' nigga tryna pipe that
She can get whatever she want
She can get that new Saint Laurent
I could put that Rollie on her arm
And I can get the bracelet with the charm

[Hook 2: PnB Rock]
I found you
Girl I like being around you
Feel like Kanye I'm Bound 2
Shawty if you down I'm down too
Yeah I found you
Girl I like being around you
Feel like Kanye I'm Bound 2
Shawty if you down I'm down too
Yeah

[Bridge 1: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are, unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

[Hook 1: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse 3: French Montana]
You ain't enough for me
Too much for you, alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
Imma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next, to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body

[Bridge 2: PnB Rock]
And you are unforgettable
And I'm so glad that I found you

[Hook 2: PnB Rock]
I found you
Girl I like being around you
Feel like Kanye I'm Bound 2
Shawty if you down I'm down too
Yeah I found you
Girl I like being around you
Feel like Kanye I'm Bound 2
Shawty if you down I'm down too
Yeah
