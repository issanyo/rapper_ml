Gotta keep a strap, can't let these niggas play me
I pulled up in some shit that make yo bitch go crazy (skrt, skrt)

Ice, water on my wrist that's why these niggas hate me (splash on 'em)
Ice, water on my wrist that's why these niggas hate me

[Verse 1]
I just hit a lick for 50 bands, yeah, yeah
And I bust it down with all my friends, yeah, yeah
If you owe me, pay me all my ends, yeah, yeah
'Cause you don't want me pulling up in them vans, yeah, yeah
Feel like Johnny Dang, diamonds on all my chains
Bitches be calling me
Whipping work on my Benz

I fuck that bitch and I gave her a xan
And she wanna do it again

All these bad bitches, they on me

Gotta keep a strap, can't let these niggas play me
I pulled up in some shit that make yo bitch go crazy (skrt, skrt)
I ain't gotta like her pics, she know a nigga wavy (hey, hey)
Ice, water on my wrist that's why these niggas hate me (splash on 'em)

You know I can't let these niggas play with me

Fuck around and I'ma let it spray
I'm hitting everything that's in the way
Hundred clip, run that shit

Niggas just talk they don't want it
I keep it a k, that's a hundred
Your bitch on my dick and she want it
I put it all up in her stomach

[Bridge]
Yeah, she rollin', rollin', rollin'
All these bad bitches, they on me
I just whipped another foreign (whip it up, whip it up)

[Chorus]
I pulled up in some shit that make yo bitch go crazy (skrt, skrt)
Ain't gotta like her pics, she know a nigga wavy (hey, hey)
Water on my wrist that's why these niggas hate me (water, splash)
Gotta keep a strap, can't let these niggas play me
Pulled up in some shit that make yo bitch go crazy (skrt, skrt)
