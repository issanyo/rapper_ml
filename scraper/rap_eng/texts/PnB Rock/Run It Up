[Hook: PnB Rock]
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I'ma die fuckin' all these hoes
I'ma die drinkin' all this lean
Kush cologne in my Bape Supreme
Pussy stains in my Balmain jeans
Bustin' juggs, I'm with my gang
Cashout all we know is one thing
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I'ma die fuckin' all these hoes
I'ma die drinkin' all this lean

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Drinking that lean like water
I just passed out in a foreign
Niggas hating cause they starvin'
I'm dunking on them Vince Carter
Scorin', Touchdown
Broke last year but I’m up now
All of my niggas we bust down
All these bad hoes wanna fuck now
Call up 10 stacks and I hit a bitch
If we ain't fucking then we ain't taking pictures
Don’t put me on Snapchat, don’t put me on Twitter
Cause I ain't yo nigga plus I'm with the hittas
And they ain't really with the cameras and shit
Cause they be really out here robbin' and shit
They be out here really robbin' and shit
They ain't really with the scammin' and shit
Like run it up run it up run it up
Come through with the chain you been havin' tucked
Cause shawty enjoying the indica
They plottin' and schemin' to line you up
Other than that I got double cups
You know its filled up with muddy stuff
These bitches they fallin' in love with us
These niggas know they can’t fuck with us

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I’ma die fuckin' all these hoes
I'ma die drinkin' all this lean
Kush cologne in my Bape Supreme
Pussy stains in my Balmain jeans
Bustin' juggs, I'm with my gang
Cashout all we know is one thing
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I’ma die fuckin' all these hoes
I'ma die drinkin' all this lean

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I woke up had all this guap, twenty cars in my garage
I work hard so shit don’t stop, RGF we living large
Just woke up, bought a beamer truck
I’m Zoovie Zoo, I don’t give a fuck
Cashout with PnB, these fuck niggas ain't seein' me
I remember they didn’t believe in me
It's fifty bands just to speak with me
Yo bitch rollin' up weed for me
She said she tryna' get skee'd with me
Took yo bitch to the mall, she tryna blow blue cheese with me
I spend it like I ball, she tryna shoot 3's with me
It's Zoovie Zoo from the Island, try us he dyin'
The FN I’m firin', its so damn inspiring
All I hear is sirens, people lookin' in silence
Like why they so violent, it's part of my environment

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
I just had a dream about drinkin' codeine
Woke up heard my trap phone ring
But that was yo ho she callin'
Heard that a young nigga ballin'
I just had a dream about drinkin' codeine
Woke up then I hopped up in the Range
Remember when I couldn’t afford it
Then I woke up and just bought it
And I just copped a new chain from my jeweler
I just robbed a nigga' claimin' he a shooter
Yo bitch just gave me medusa
You ain’t shit, pussy nigga I'd do ya
I’m rollin' with niggas that's all on the same thing
New money, new lane gang
Fuck a bitch she like how my chain swing
Last year I was broke, tryna' get it off on the stove
Now a nigga on the road, 20k for a show
Did it all with my bros, fuck the law, fuck these hoes
Fuck the opps and my foes, kill em all get the dough

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I'ma die fuckin' all these hoes
I'ma die drinkin' all this lean
Kush cologne in my Bape Supreme
Pussy stains in my Balmain jeans

Cashout all we know is one thing
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up run it up run it up
Woke up had all this money
Thank god that it wasn't a dream
I'ma die fuckin' all these hoes
