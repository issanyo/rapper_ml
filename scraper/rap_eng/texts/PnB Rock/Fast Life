[Intro: PnB Rock]
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast

[Verse 1: Loso Loaded]
I got them racks, they on me
I got your bitch, she on me
She with me now, lil' nigga
We gettin' lit, lil' homie
Diamonds on me bust down
Young nigga poppin', boy look at me now
Got fifteen K up out the house
Done fucked this shit up, stand up on the couch
Slap a nigga out for runnin' his mouth
That ain't really what he 'bout
I got racks and racks it came with the stack
Brand new whip, it come with new paper tags
Doin' millions, put that it down on my head
Broke ass nigga, you ain't spendin' no cash
Livin' like some crazy nigga might crash
Pull up, serve a brick straight out the Jag'
I ain't talking 'bout change, I ain't never been lame
Pulled up to the flame, damn I love my brain
These niggas Margielas, I don't do shoestrings
Dat bitch wanna fuck, run a choo-choo train

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast

[Verse 2: Loso Loaded]
Pull up on you, go two hundred
Straight A nigga, fuck a homo'
I done grinded through the summer
Started shinin' in the winter
I'ma eat a hundred thousand just for dinner
I got the bag, Loso Loaded never goin' out back
Fuck the coppers, I'ma get on the gas
If this rapper shit don't work for a nigga
Then we out here kicking dope for the pack
Poppa say they ain't even know how to act
Ninth ward, put this shit on my back
I get the butter, put that on the bread
All these hundreds, nigga check out the spread
Off-white, put that shit on my leg
Twenty thousand, I put that on your head
Get the pack and keep it goin', guess I took it, I ain't owin'
Hesitation, I don't do it, I just wake up and get to it
Forty thousand dollars shinin', put that shit around my neck
If she acting like a slut, I'ma treat her like a bitch

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast
Racks on racks on racks, I got the bag
I'm loadin' cash, my bitch she bad
Fuck 12, runnin' red lights, I'm doin' the dash
Young nigga got my bread right, so I'm livin' fast
Yeah
