You dont stay in the wheel
Plus i remember when you held me down
When i was in jail
Locked up in the cell
Can read on my books
And flicks in the mail
My visiting days
You was up in the jail
But now im home
And we on now
You can have anything you want now
And all loss shit is designer
And everything we drivin is a foregin now
Yea fuck niggas fuck bitches get money
Look at them they mad me stuntin
Gods wishes we ain't tellin them nun
