[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Oh, what is this about?
Lately you been trippin' out
Tellin' me you love me
But you know damn well I don't do no cuffing
Shawty not at all, not at all, not at all, not all
Not at all, ho not at all, not at all, nah, nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
All that cuffin', I'm too young for that
I was big girl, if I said love I wanted that
Fuck from you must not heard none of my songs
It's get this money, fuck these bitches 'til I'm gone
Same shit, different day, different money, different lay
Went to sleep broke motherfucker then you in the way
Niggas always frontin' like they block goin' a brick a day
Your bitch text him goodbye, and them niggas ain't got shit to say
No, ooh, peep these niggas' faces
Jealous shit, you won't get nowhere hatin'
Fuckin' bitches, I don't cuff 'em, I don't want relations
'Til I make it swear to god that trapping is my occupation
Ooh, sneaky bitch just try to say she love me
Her man just died, she's fuckin' his brother
It's funny 'cause she think she know me though
But she gon' lock me up and kill me like I'm Romeo, nah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Oh, what is this about?
Lately you been trippin' out
Tellin' me you love me
But you know damn well I don't do no cuffing
Shawty not at all, not at all, not at all, not all
Not at all, ho not at all, not at all, nah, nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Deek215]
We don't trust 'em, we just fuck 'em
We duck 'em, we never love 'em
They see you gettin' that fame, bitches down for whatever
She say like the way that I rap, and she like the way that I shine
I'ma fuck her quick to get my nut off
Never stoppin' my grind
She called my phone and said she heard me on the radio
I started laughin' like damn bitch I already know
She said she kinda upset because I let her go
I said damn that's crazy, but yeah I gotta go
Hold up, I ain't come from that
Lil nigga too young for that
It's MOB, I want every dollar
Every cent, you gettin' none of that, huh
Not at all, that's the reason that I ball
When I was down, dead and broke
You ain't answer none of my calls
Not at all, that's the reason that I ball
When I was down, dead and broke
You ain't answer none of my calls
Damn, back it up
These hoes be acting up
She said she love me
Had a nigga just crackin' up, let's go

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Oh, what is this about?
Lately you been trippin' out
Tellin' me you love me
But you know damn well I don't do no cuffing
Shawty not at all
Oh, what is this about?
Thinkin' you my nigga now
Callin' me your bro
But was you sayin' that shit a week ago?
Pussy nigga not at all, not at all, not all, not at all
Not at all, ho not at all, not at all, nah, nah, nah nah nah, ooh
Oh yeah
