[Intro: 24hrs]
Yeah
24hrs

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Hop in the pussy and dive
Here go the keys to my ride
Girl, don't you look through my phone
Have trust in a nigga, you know that we grown
I know that I'm right and I'm wrong
Ain't no way a nigga can leave you alone
The money too long, the money too long
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Fuck you too good, I fuck you too good
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
I'm drivin' these foreigns, I'm drivin' these foreigns
You won't leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
I'm biggin' my scale
Know that young Twenty gon' pay for your nails
The money is sumo
The money ain't, money ain't ever been frail
Your nigga can't fuck
I'm fuckin' you good, I'm never gon' tell
We valet the truck
They open the door, they know what the smell
Dial on my bust-down
I just went on tour, I made me a hunnid
Don't mention the name
The chopper come out and you better get runnin'
These haters is lame
Don't mention my name, just get you some money
Comedian niggas
Can't fuck with you niggas, you niggas is funny

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Hop in the pussy and dive
Here go the keys to my ride
Girl, don't you look through my phone
Have trust in a nigga, you know that we grown
I know that I'm right and I'm wrong
Ain't no way a nigga can leave you alone
The money too long, the money too long
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Fuck you too good, I fuck you too good
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
I'm drivin' these foreigns, I'm drivin' these foreigns
You won't leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
(Leave me alone)
How you gon', how you gon' leave
When I'm the one that keep your neck on freeze? (Freeze)
I put you in them VV's
Had Nudie on you, I put you in Supreme (Supreme)
You can go fuck with them niggas
But you know them niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Never)
They only take you to soul food (Never)
I only take you to Nobu
I put you up in that Rover
Took you places, won't forget what I showed you (Never)
They only take you to soul food (Never)
I only take you to Nobu
I put you up in that Rover
Took you places, won't forget what I showed you

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Hop in the pussy and dive
Here go the keys to my ride
Girl, don't you look through my phone
Have trust in a nigga, you know that we grown
I know that I'm right and I'm wrong
Ain't no way a nigga can leave you alone
The money too long, the money too long
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Fuck you too good, I fuck you too good
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
I'm drivin' these foreigns, I'm drivin' these foreigns
You won't leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way you'll leave me alone
Ain't no way, ain't no way you'll leave me alone
