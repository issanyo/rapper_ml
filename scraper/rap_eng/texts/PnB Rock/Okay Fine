[Intro: Jay Critch]
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch & PnB Rock]
Shawty think she mine, I don't know (I don't know)
Tryna get high, okay fine, we gon' smoke (okay fine)
I been really on my grind for the dope
Tryna ice my wrist, look at the time, see the snow
Hey, shawty think she mine, I don't know
I don't cuff hoes, I already know she fucked my bro, ayy
Young nigga gettin' to the dough, got it for the low
What you need? Just hit my trap phone, ayy
Young nigga pull up in the Ghost
I got bands on me, used to post up by the store, ayy (bands)
She say that I flex, I do the most
Pull up in a 'rari, windows down, smell like dope, hey
Aww shit, 12 comin', get low, yeah
I can't let them take this bankroll, yeah
Flowin' through the city with my bros, yeah
Ridin' with them poles, 'bout to pull up on some hoes, yeah

[Verse: Jay Critch & PnB Rock]
Hey, big knots, blue cheese in a Balmain
Nigga we ain't playin' with that money, got it on me
I just got some money, ran off with your shawty
Used to ride the bus, now I pull up in a 'rari, hey
Now I pull up in a 'rari
Drove past my ex, yeah, that bitch was lookin' salty
Know I had to flex, yeah, I ain't never sorry
Thought I would be broke for forever, bitch, I'm ballin'
Now I got a mansion, now my diamonds dancin'
I'm pushin' the Wraith, 'member dreamin' 'bout a Phantom
Peep the haters' faces, I know that they can't stand it
Run up, try to take it, you know I got that hammer
Ayy, hit it then replace it, lean up in the Fanta
Shawty, you too basic, I can't be your man, no
Diamonds they are racist, flashin' like a camera
Do the dash, speed racing, pull up in a Lambo', hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch & PnB Rock]
Shawty think she mine, I don't know (I don't know)
Tryna get high, okay fine, we gon' smoke (okay fine)
I been really on my grind for the dope
Tryna ice my wrist, look at the time, see the snow
Hey, shawty think she mine, I don't know
I don't cuff hoes, I already know she fucked my bro, ayy
Young nigga gettin' to the dough, got it for the low
What you need? Just hit my trap phone, ayy
Young nigga pull up in the Ghost
I got bands on me, used to post up by the store, ayy (bands)
She say that I flex, I do the most
Pull up in a 'rari, windows down, smell like dope, hey
Aww shit, 12 comin', get low, yeah
I can't let them take this bankroll, yeah
Flowin' through the city with my bros, yeah
Ridin' with them poles, 'bout to pull up on some hoes, yeah
