[Chorus]
Outside on a corner with a package
And you already knew I was trappin'
Got my hand on my mother fucking ratchet
Fell in love with the semi-automatic
If a bitch act crazy imma slap her
Why you playing with the L nigga pass it
AK47 in the attic
I fell in love with the semi-automatic
Outside on a corner with a package
And you already knew I was trappin'
Got my hand on my mother fucking ratchet
Fell in love with the semi-automatic
If a bitch act crazy imma slap her
Why you playing with the L nigga pass it
AK47 in the attic
I fell in love with the semi-automatic

[Verse 1: Key!]
Glock 8 chain with the beam on it
Ayo I'm shooting from the side you ain't know ?
Stuffin' 47 in the 50 round
If I pull out bet it's goin' down
9 millimeter fourty rounds
45 fifty count knock ‘em down
Desert eagle knock a fly nigga down
Desert eagle knock a fly nigga down
Okay I'm so in love with fashion
All my Glocks they be matching
Okay I made myself rich
Now I got shooters at the mansion
Okay I didn't choose this it kinda sorta just happened
Got [?] at my aim
I’m in love with the crashin'
You can hear all the passion, you can see if you want
I fell in love with semi-automatic
Come and get what you want

[Chorus]
Outside on a corner with a package
And you already knew I was trappin'
Got my hand on my mother fucking ratchet
Fell in love with the semi-automatic
If a bitch act crazy imma slap her
Why you playing with the L nigga pass it
AK47 in the attic
I fell in love with the semi-automatic

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
New glizzy it came with extensions
All my niggas yea, we came from the trenches
I was over there slanging by the benches
Cops came we was jumpin’ over fences
All my life it been money over bitches
Niggas pussy they be shootin' from a distance
See me? Imma different type of nigga
I walk down so I know I won’t miss 'em
Oh yea Imma trap star so much that I got it tatted
I used to serve my homie momma when she became an addict
I know I did a lot of shit
But I can't say I regret it
They say that life a fucking gamble
And I’m willing to bet it
You should know
I’m the man, I drink lean, don’t pop xans
Trynna run inside my spot
Take ya life, Gucci Mane
All my life I lived the same
Man this shit is still a game
Squeeze a trigger kill again
Gotta get it how you live...

[Chorus]
Outside on a corner with a package
And you already knew I was trappin'
Got my hand on my mother fucking ratchet
Fell in love with the semi-automatic
If a bitch act crazy imma slap her
Why you playing with the L nigga pass it
AK47 in the attic
I fell in love with the semi-automatic

[Outro]
Fell in love with my mother fucker
Fell in love with my mother fuckin' savage
Fell in love with a mother fucking ratchet
Motherfuckin' savage
