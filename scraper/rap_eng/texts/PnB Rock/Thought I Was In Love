Funny how I thought I was in love (I was in love, ooh)
Found out that that bitch, she was a dub (she was a dub, ooh)
Fucked up, but niggas in the cut (in the cut)
Fucked up that bitch, she had my trust (she had my trust)
It's funny how I thought I was in love (was in love)
It's crazy how I thought I was in love (was in love)

Fucked up that bitch, she had my trust

[Verse 1]
It's crazy she was just my fucking bae (fucking bae)
I was just with her the other day (other day)
Told her get the fuck up out my face (out my face)
And got no right, bitch, nothin' left to say
I'm the one that put you in that Wraith (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With the stars, had you high up, outer space (outer space, ya)
Put that Fendi and that Goyard on your waist (on your waist, ya)
Just to see that smile up on your face (on your face, ya)
'Member when we had sex on a jet (on a jet)
Hit it from that back, I had that pussy so wet (huh)
VVs on yo' wrist, I put them VVs on yo' neck (huh)
But you know I'm petty, I need all my shit back (huh)
That's a fact (huh)
When I met you, girl, yo' ass wasn't even that fat (huh)
I'm the one that spent that track on you
Girl I flex on you
How you fuckin' all these lames when you know what's best for you?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Funny how I thought I was in love (I was in love, ooh)
Found out that that bitch, she was a dub (she was a dub, ooh)
Fucked other niggas in the cut (in the cut)
Fucked up that bitch, she had my trust (she had my trust)
It's funny how I thought I was in love (was in love)
It's crazy how I thought I was in love (was in love)
It's crazy how I thought I was in love (was in love, ya)
Fucked up that bitch, she had my trust (had my trust)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I thought she was gon' be my BM (be my BM)
Found out she was all in niggas DMs (niggas DMs)
Slidin', you slidin' like a ramp (skrrt skrrt)
Damn
I don't understand
I know that I had you figured out (figured out)
I can't believe this comin' out my mouth (out my mouth)
You broke my heart, you left me down and out (down and out)
Now it's "fuck you," bitch, I don't want you around (bitch)
Damn, I'm the fuckin' man

Flew my new bitch to Japan (Japan)
Ocean with the sand
Calamari with the shrimp (shrimp)
I remember when, when you wasn't on my plans
Damn

[Chorus]
It's funny how I thought I was in love (it's funny how I thought I was in love)
