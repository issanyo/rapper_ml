[Intro: Don Q & PnB Rock]
Don
Yeah
PnB wusgood?
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Philly, NY

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Yeah, fuck you, I don't need new friends
Just me and my gang 'til the end
No I'm not chasing no trends
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm tryna whip me a Benz
Re-up and cop me a Lamb
Catch me a lick on the scam
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
Fuck you, I don't need new friends
I'm tryna whip me a Benz
Re-up and cop me a Lamb
I'm too busy chasing these bands

[Verse 1: Don Q]
Hit the bank and take cash out it
I don't come if I can't get stacks out it
I used to hustle out of trap houses
Now we live good and just rap 'bout it
Like a Nascar, when I'm back out it
I drop the top and I take the back out it
We never fight over hoes, no
We fuck 'em pass' em then we laugh 'bout it
Wait, they try to come for the king, nigga the fuck do you mean?
Fell asleep soakin' a bean and this stupid bitch drunk all my lean
Hundred bitches for a sleepover
Codeine soda, top lean over
Nigga, I just can't sleep sober
Ten pints before the week over
Like damn, new niggas they was never around
I know that papa will be very proud
Smoking cigars with Kevin Liles
Fuck is you niggas gon' tell me now?
I be with the demons
I whip the beamer where I'm sippin' steam
And all these diamonds make me feel conceited
If I tuck my chain, bet you still could see it
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Fuck you, I don't need new friends
Just me and my gang 'til the end
No I'm not chasing no trends
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm tryna whip me a Benz
Re-up and cop me a Lamb
Catch me a lick on the scam
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
I'm too busy chasing these bands
Fuck you, I don't need new friends
I'm tryna whip me a Benz
Re-up and cop me a Lamb
I'm too busy chasing these bands

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Bounty hunter for the bands
I found another hundred bands (got it)
I might of lost of couple friends (fuck it)
But I found a bunch of rubber bands (yup)
I see you haters throwing jabs
I'm counting punches with the bands
I caught the wave for the money
Cowabunga with the bands
Oh, oh, count the money while I dance
Bust it, bust it, now she my number one fan
I found her thumbing through the 'gram
Now we stuntin' in the Lamb
The pound underneath the pan
Sound like thunder with it blams
Don't make me go Westbrook
You got zero on me like Westbrook
All three of y'all is a dub now
That's a triple double like Westbrook
That mean mug you rockin really just a Iâ€™m broke and I'm stressed look
I leveled up so my ice grill is just how the Rolex look
Let's get it!

[Hook: PnB Rock]
