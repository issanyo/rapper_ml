[Chorus]
Still remember my first lick
When I really got paid
Won't' forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like, "Damn, what could have been?"
See me winnin', now she thinking "What could have been?"
What if we could just rewind?
What could have been?
Is there a time limit on trying?
What could have been?
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been?
Used to say I want your time
What could have been?

[Post-Chorus]
Haven't seen her in a long time
Have you seen her?
Can we press rewind?
In a long time haven't seen her
I been thinkin'

[Verse 1]
Every time I was in LA, I was with my lil' side bitch
Every time you would call me trippin', I was like "Girl, stop it"
I was doing the most, I was out there fuckin' them hoes
I was out there smoking dope, mobbing with my bros
Yeah, you already know
Shawty, I been missing your style
Shawty, I been missing your smile
Shawty, I been missin' the way you make me feel
You been on my mind
Like, I just wanna come back
Girl, you got me like that
That's 'cause I still think about you

[Chorus]
Still remember my first lick
When I really got paid
Won't' forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like, "Damn, what could have been?"
See me winnin', now she thinking "What could have been?"
What if we could just rewind?
What could have been?
Is there a time limit on trying?
What could have been?
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been?
Used to say I want your time
What could have been?

[Post-Chorus]
Haven't seen her in a long time
Have you seen her?
Can we press rewind?
In a long time haven't seen her
I been thinkin'

[Verse 2]
I ain't fell in love since you
It wasn't real if it wasn't you
I swear that them bitches, they can't fuck with you
The way you left me girl, what was a thug to do(do)
Yeah, yeah
What you thought I'd do?
I was in love with you
I was in love with you (I was in love with you)
Yeah, I was in love with you  (I was in love with you)

[Chorus]
Still remember my first lick
When I really got paid
Won't' forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like, "Damn, what could have been?"
See me winnin', now she thinking "What could have been?"
What if we could just rewind?
What could have been?
Is there a time limit on trying?
What could have been?
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been?
Used to say I want your time
What could have been?

[Post-Chorus]
Haven't seen her in a long time
Have you seen her?
Can we press rewind?
In a long time haven't seen her
I been thinkin'
