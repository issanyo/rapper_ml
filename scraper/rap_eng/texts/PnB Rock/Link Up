[Verse 1: B.Love]
Started as a follower on the Gram, like all of my bitches, showing her to all of my friends
Like, bad bitch, she in first place
Tryna get to her place, hope for first base
Or maybe back to my crib, fuck in my bed
Edgucated hood chick, she don't know what a thot is
Man crush on a Monday, sware to god she gonna be my bitch one day
I just wanna link up, talk about anything you could think of
IPhone, baby, I just wanna sinck us
Back shots all night, eat the pussy nice
Or take you to K and P, get you what you like
Take a trip to Sean, and get you that ice
I knew you was something special, in my mind, baby I just wanna dress you
In them heals, in the red bottoms
In them big bags, tell all your friends about it
And them trips to the islands, baby, I just see you smiling
On the link up, she know I'm thuggin
She just wanna embrace him, and she all the snatch life
Girl, you just need to act right

This can't be love, Looking at us like this can't be us

Late nights, I would call, you would go gass the Cameri up
Snick you in, lift the Fameri up
Late nights on the Gram, throgh the Mammery up
You said time was money, girl, you better add me up
Everybody be like, please don't like her, please don't wife her
She's not the type of girl that you should fall for
Late nights, you the only one I call for
Tryna ride, but you already got a ride for

Let's talk until the morning, anything you can think of
