*Needs work*

[Intro: Dreezy & PnB Rock]
They talk bout money, they ain't really gettin' it huh
Lil bitch!
Don't give a fuck nigga
Bitch you ain't low
It's Dreezy, Rock, let's get it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
I don't need nobody
I'm whippin' a lowbody (lowrider)
The dock gotta human inside
The engine is robotic
I pull up reverse then I hop in the bird
Then switch up the whole topic
These bitches be fucking these niggas for nothin'
They ain't gettin' no profit
I'ma go shop when I land
Hop on a plane with no bags
I know I'm makin' them mad, went and got[?]
Tell him to go a lil faster
He got that top like a grad, I'ma put him ahead of the class
Either way know I ain't givin' no pass
Niggas be faking like a [?] on a mask
Ball so hard, fell in love with it, feeling like Sanaa Lathan
I just got top from a Muslim and I told him as-salamu alaykum
I don't fuck with nobody, let his mama say
I'm goin' through a phase yeah
Shoulda known you a back stabber
Had a knife tatted on your face yeah
You know it's cash when I talk
Valentino when I walk
The hatin' shit won't get you far
[?] coupe is the car
Got a whole thang on me right now
Smell like a P when I walk
Know I said I want a couple M's
But know I want B's in the vault
It's Dreez!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

[Verse 2: Dreezy]
I'm doin' 80 on the E-way out in Calabasas
My eyes don't see no pussy niggas through these Gucci glasses
I pull up in that 911 they like, "That's a classic"
You could be anything in life but wanna be a mad bitch
I know you see me like 3D, niggas be fake like BB
I'm passing a hoe like I'm Mimi
You don't be no where that we be
I know some rich nigga who gone go
'Cus I stay on leak like Nene
I know some bitches hatin' on the low
But in real life they wanna be me yeah
I'm up in a ballin' house, I gotta ring like I'm callin' out
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Me and my bitches ain't fallin' out
You say you ballin' how
Beefin' with me at yo momma house
Chopper gon' make a bitch "Walk It Out"
Flexin' on me, then I'm poppin' now

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Dreezy]
These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul

These niggas be hatin', these niggas be fakin' it
They talkin' bout money, they ain't really get it
These bitches be snakin', these bitches be grimey
They be tryna lie to me, they be thinkin' I'm slippin'
I stay on my toes, niggas be thinkin' they low
Bitches be thinkin' I'm slow, little do they know
Everyday I got my pole, I swear I can't trust a soul
