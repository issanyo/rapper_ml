[Intro]
DP on the beat
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride

[Verse 1]
You ain't my girl, but you my ride or die
Fuck titles and all that, cause you know I'm yours and you're mine
Ever since I met you, girl, you've always been by my side
You always there when I call, and you always on time
Fuck with you girl cause know you ain't basic
Not to mention the sex is amazing
When I met you, I thought you was Asian
From your eyes I could tell you was blazin'
In this world where nothing seem to faze me
Girl you always just seem to amaze me
All these bitches they can't have my heart
It's already taken

[Chorus]
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride

[Verse 2]
Let her roll my gas, she count all my cash
Take them 50's and them 100's and she put it in her bag
She got them main bitches mad
'Cause she stay drippin' with swag
She knows she got it, she so bad
She get it, she don't have to ask
Yeah, yeah, girl that's right, huh
Poppin' and I'm poppin' too, so yeah they gon' stare
Yeah, yeah, girl that's right, huh
You poppin' and I'm poppin' too, of course they gon' stare
You rollin' I'm rollin', we lit
Girl I'm so glad you my bitch
You got me so jealous and sick
When they see you, pull up in my whip
Niggas mad I ain't fuckin' with them
Yeah they wish I was fuckin' with them
They just mad 'cause it's us to the end
No, I can't put my trust into them

[Chorus]
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride
I'ma one night stand, cuffing wasn't in the plans
Until you came through, you was stunting with your friends
You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe
And then, I said "let's ride" and you hopped in my ride
