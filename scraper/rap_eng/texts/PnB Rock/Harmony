[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, ooh

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart

[Verse 1: B.Love]
I think about replacing you
You think you were irreplaceable
I'm moving on, trust me girl I'm fully capable
I'm in love, swear this feeling's not mistakable
I got this other place that I go to get away from you
Where the girl inside she often tells me not to wait for you
So much fucking hate for you, I need to get away from you
I tell you that I'll leave but you know I'll always stay with you
Yeah I'm out with her, but I'm coming home to lay with you
I can't let you go, girl that's something that you know
She said tell me something new, she said something that I don't
Always tell you that I'll leave, always tell me that I won't
And I hide on my emotions, that's not something I should flaunt
I'm with her, I'm with you, guess I'm split between the two
All this talk bout me and her, girl let's talk bout me and you
And I found my Cinderella, I think she could fit the shoe
Once you notice that I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' do?

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I know, I know, I know, I know this sound crazy
Cause you know, you know, you know, you know you my baby
But I know, I know, I know, I know you can't change me
Plus this girl Harmony, she got control of me
She got a hold on me, got me like no don't leave
Girl you the one I want, but she's the one I need
The one I need
She gon' get me to the money
She gon' keep a nigga stuntin'
When I'm with her don't need nothing, no
And you probably don't wanna hear this but it's true
Them other bitches they don't compare to you
Girl when we together we do what we do
We had great sex, I mean all night
With no latex, just straight hard pipe
I laid comfortable with you all night
But me and Harmony is different
She live in my soul, she see all my visions
We go in that booth and make them childrens
Shawty you don't even get it, listen

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart
