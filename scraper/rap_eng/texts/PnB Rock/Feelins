[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna know
Who you be callin'
Who you be textin'
When you be all on your phone
Girl, why you flexin'?
You got my message, but I stressin'
You be thinkin' you low
And you think I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, there's somebody next to you (that's hatin' on me)
I don't know what they tellin' you (but they don't know me)
I can fuck up a check on you (I got money)
Girl, if you know what's best for you (then you would call me)
Girl, I'm low key obsessed with you
Yeah, I'm low key obsessed with you (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
Got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings

[Verse 2]
I remember when it used to be
Just me and my baby, drop top in a Mercedes
Bergdorf goin' crazy, Off-white goin' crazy
YSL goin' crazy, but where have you been lately?
Lately you been tryna play me
We used to fuck on the daily
Shawty, you know I'm too wavy

[Pre-Chorus]
It must be somebody next to you (that's hatin' on me)
I don't know what they tellin' you (they don't know me)
I can fuck up a check on you ('cause I got money)
Girl, if you know what's best for you (then you would call me)
'Cause I'm low key obsessed with you (yeah yeah)
Girl, I'm low key obsessed with you (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
Got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings

[Verse 3]
I know us and you know us
Girl, this shit ain't addin' up
I miss when we would pull up
And make the neighbors mad at us
Need you 'round 'cause I been down
Pop a Addy, now I'm up
Girl don't flex, you got my text
Send the addy, I'll pull up
Drop top in the 'Rari
It used to be me and my shawty
Now it's just me and I'm lonely
Girl, don't act like you don't want me
'Cause all of these niggas be on you
But all of these bitches be on me
Miss seein' you in the morning

[Chorus]
You got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings, in my feelings
No, this shit ain't been the same no, we so distant
Know you miss how I be thuggin', on my hood shit
Girl, I miss how we be fuckin', and you ain't my bitch
Got a nigga in my feelings

[Outro]
Got a nigga in my feelings
Got a nigga in my feelings
Got a nigga in my feelings
In my feelings
