[Hook: PNB Roc]
I'm making money, but I still need more
I'm pushing forins, but I still need more
Got bad bitches, but I still need more
I just hit, she said she still need more
I'm so high, but I sware I still need more
Off the lean, but I still need more
Pop the beam, but I think I need more
Where the weed, man, I sware I need more

[Verse 1: Dice SoHo]
I sware I ain't finished, I need more
Racks up in my jeans, but I sware I need more
I asked her, have she been this high before
She smiled, and told me SoHo, give me more
In the Lamborghini, wip or porsh
Cameras flashing once I open doors
Bitch, I'm getting money, you should get your's
20,000 1s all on the floor
Can't nobody stop it, Dice SoHo the topic
I got Taho popppin, baby, this is on me
Diamonds dancing on me, I need more
She give me good  giraffe, I had to get some more

I'm making money, but I still need more
I'm pushing forins, but I still need more
Got bad bitches, but I still need more
I just hit, she said she still need more
I'm so high, but I sware I still need more
Off the lean, but I still need more
Pop the beam, but I think I need more
Where the weed, man, I sware I need more

[Verse 2: Dice SoHo]
Smoked a couple zips, I need some more
She said she want to smoke, so I rolled some more
She just want to fuck, we fuck some more
But I just want the head, and nothing more
You can't name no one hot as me
I be killing shit, me, and my dog, PNB
Tryna make my life a movie, tell her come over and see
But my lifestyle ain't free, you gotta come with a fee
Shaudy want some coke, cause she rollin off a bean
It's a lituation, talking bout money, see
And everybody know, Dice got all the bands
Bitches take me out, I'm hella
Icy, forever rich
