[Intro]
Rest in peace to my, rest in peace to my hitta
Rest in peace to my hitta, rest in peace to my hitta
Rest in peace to my hitta, rest in peace to my hitta
Rest in peace to my hitta, oh yeahh

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in my car right now
Smokin' on this killer weed
Damn this shit is killin' me
Thinkin' bout these memories
Just thinkin' bout the times we shared
And all the shit you did for me
Nobody could fill your shoes
World stopped when I lost you
I'm stressin'
These tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
I would always wear your clothes after school
I was tryna be cool
I was tryna be just like you
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
Me and you used to ride around town with the music up loud
I swear you was that nigga in town

[Chorus:]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause

[Verse 2]
It ain't no question, you was such a blessing
Tried to keep me off the street shit
Keep me out the precinct
You was my protection
Sometimes I feel like I took you for granted
And nobody would ever understand it
You told me to keep up with the music
I know you would proud at where I landed
These tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
When my mom used to call you up
Any time I was cuttin' up
You would fuck me up
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
I would always sneak in your room
Just to play with your guns
Paranoid 'cause if you caught me, I was done

[Chorus]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause

[Verse 3]
You taught me so many lessons
But I know all dogs go to heaven
You died way before your time
You had me rockin' Trueys in '07
You had me rockin' purple label shit
I had bout every pair of Jay's again
You was the glue that kept the fam together
When you died we went our separate ways instead
I got these tears rollin' down my face
'Cause I'm thinkin' bout those days
You would always buy a new cell phone
I would ask you for your old cell phone
I was tryna be grown
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
'Cause I'm thinkin' bout those days
You would come through and teach me how to stunt
You would buy a nigga anything I want
I mean anything I want

[Chorus]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause
I'm missin' you
