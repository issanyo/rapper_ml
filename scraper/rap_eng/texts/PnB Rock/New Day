[Intro]
Oh yeah
That be Maaly Raw
Yeah, aye Maaly this some different shit right here bruh

[Chorus]
Ah man god damn it's a new day
Now I'm getting money I swear everything's changed
Now all these bad bitches tryna be my main
And now all these lame niggas tryna be with gang
No, I done made a new lane
Pull up on your block in that fucking Mulsanne
Your bitch on my top like a fucking toupee
'Cause she see the guap bussin' out my Balmains

[Verse 1]
Man I swear I'm too paid
Young nigga balling like I'm playing 2K
I can't fuck with these niggas cause they too fake
All they do is hate, man they too fugay
Niggas in the hood talking about shooting me
But I'm still in the hood ain't shit you could do to me
Pull up, hop out, what's up, right now
I'm in the hood with a stainless
Walk around like I ain't famous
Pussy nigga what you thinking?
I fuck around leave you brainless
I bet you thought I was just singin'
You ain't know I'm on that gang shit
You ain't know that I'm so dangerous
And all my niggas on the same shit
Fuck around and leave you flamed quick
Pussy niggas on that lame shit

[Chorus]
Ah man god damn it's a new day
Now I'm getting money I swear everything's changed
Now all these bad bitches tryna be my main
And now all these lame niggas tryna be with gang
No, I done made a new lane
Pull up on your block in that fucking Mulsanne
Your bitch on my top like a fucking toupee
'Cause she see the guap bussin' out my Balmains

[Verse 2]
Man I swear I'm too paid
I woke up like "fuck it I might buy a new K"
Diamonds dancing you can see my shit like blu ray
I just fucked this nigga bitch, she tryna be my new bae
No, I can't do no cuffing
I'm just tryna fuck you bitch I keep that shit a hunnit
Hit it from the back you feel that shit all in your stomach
Pull ya hair grip ya neck like bitch it ain't no runnin'
I be on that thug shit
Bitches fall in love quick
If I catch that vibe shorty then you getting dubbed quick
Don't blow my high unless you paying for these drugs bitch
I'm on another level don't make me forget you
And have me like

[Chorus]
Ah man god damn it's a new day
Now I'm getting money I swear everything's changed
Now all these bad bitches tryna be my main
And now all these lame niggas tryna be with gang
No, I done made a new lane
Pull up on your block in that fucking Mulsanne
Your bitch on my top like a fucking toupee
'Cause she see the guap bussin' out my Balmains
