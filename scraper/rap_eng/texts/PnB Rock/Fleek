I was on South street when I seent her
Body of a goddess, she a diva
Everything about her say keeper
Shawty got it all, that's why i just gotta meet her
Her bags say Birkin, yeah
Ass so perfect, yeah
And I can tell just by how it's moving
That she doing it on purpose, yeah
She look like it's real, like Chanel
MAC lipgloss on, I can tell
It's crazy how she look like an angel
But them red bottoms give them bitches hell
I swear she the number one stunner
Can't see them other girls, I don't want them
And plus, she by herself, there's no distractions
So I'm about to go and get her number
