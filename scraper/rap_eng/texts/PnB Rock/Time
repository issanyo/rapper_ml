[Intro]
1Mind
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
This time
Yeah

[Chorus]
This time, this time
I don't wanna play with you anymore
Girl, I'm not the same as I was before
I just want your love, I don't want a war
But this time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day
Out here livin' life, it just ain't the same
'Cause this time, this time
This time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day

[Verse 1]
I want you all to myself
I thought I told you I'm selfish
It's crazy, I knew how you felt
With all of these girls, I can't help it
I can't lie, girl I can't lie
Need you by my side, need you by my side
Shawty, you was down to ride, you was down to die
And all I did was lie and make you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
But you ain't leavin' if it's somethin' I can do about it
I messed up about a million times but who's countin'
Broke your heart about a million times but who's countin'
I know you won't leave
I know you tired of me but

[Chorus]
This time, this time
I don't wanna play with you anymore
Girl, I'm not the same as I was before
I just want your love, I don't want a war
But this time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day
Out here livin' life, it just ain't the same
'Cause this time, this time
This time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day

[Verse 2]
Need you every night, need you every day
You be on my mind more than everything
I miss the way that you care
And all the good times that we shared
Yeah, you got me, got me
Girl, you got me, got me
Yeah, you know I miss the way you move your body, body
So many times you caught me out there with them thotties, thotties
I'ma show you that I changed and can't nobody stop me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you ain't leavin' if it's somethin' I can do about it
I messed up about a million times but who's countin'
Broke your heart about a million times but who's countin'
I know you won't leave
I know you tired of me but

[Chorus]
This time, this time
I don't wanna play with you anymore
Girl, I'm not the same as I was before
I just want your love, I don't want a war
But this time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day
Out here livin' life, it just ain't the same
'Cause this time, this time
This time, this time
I don't wanna play, girl I wanna stay
Need you every night, need you every day
