[Hook: PnB Rock]
Shawty, hop in my ride
Pull them panties to the side
I'll do anything you like
Yeah 'cause I'm tryna get into you
Tryna get into you
We've been smoking all night
We've been drinking all night
We've been flirting all night
Yeah and I'm just tryna get into you
I'm just tryna get into you

[Verse 1: Crown Bella]
Nigga was all in my ear talkin' 'bout what the fuck he gon' do to it
I'm feelin' his swag, I like when he sayin' but no I'm not new to it
I ask him do he like to eat on the box, he said, "No but I do do it"
He callin' my bluff but I'm 'bout to bust, it's funny 'cause who knew it?
Take it back, it was more than a crush
Everythin' that he had, it was more than enough
Feelin' like MJ, it was more than a touch
We was fuckin' in the night, in the mornin' and lunch
It was way more than clutch
Kept sayin' Mr. Henny but it's more so the Dutch
Kept sayin' it's the Bent but it's more so the Rolls
'Cause you know what goes down when the curtains is closed

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Shawty, hop in my ride
Pull them panties to the side
I'll do anything you like
Yeah 'cause I'm tryna get into you
Tryna get into you
We've been smoking all night
We've been drinking all night
We've been flirting all night
Yeah and I'm just tryna get into you
I'm just tryna get into you

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I'm tryna get into you
Girl, there's a lot of things I wanna do
I'm so glad I got you here in this car
Them panties to the side, you ain't gotta take 'em off
God damn
Pulled over so I could fuck you with the top down
Bend over, I wanna hit that G spot now
Pull out, I ain't done with the pussy
Before I make you cum, put my tongue on the pussy
Shawty, I know what you like
I'm 'bout to that by the end of the night
You gon' always want this dick in your life
'Cause shawty, that nigga ain't hittin' it right
And I know that
Hit your neck while I'm fuckin', yeah, I choke that
Wrap your hand around my head while I pull that
Ask you is this pussy mine, you say, "Oh yeah"
And can I hit it all night? You say, "Oh yeah"
