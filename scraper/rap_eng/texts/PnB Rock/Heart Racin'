[Intro]
Yeah
Got my heart racin'
Can't wait till we all make it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'
I can't fuck with niggas, they be all hatin'
It's funny how these bitches think we all datin'
Ohhh, I be heart breakin'
I can't fuck with bitches, they be all chasin'
Drivin' in this foreign got my heart racin'
I swear I can't wait until we all make it
Yeah, till we all make it
I swear I can't wait until we all make it
Drivin' in that foreign got my heart racin'
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'

[Verse 1]
Man I swear this right here might be my theme song
I don't leave the house if I don't got my chains on
Sorry, baby, I can't cuff you, bitch, I ain't gone
I just wanna smoke dope and get my lean on
Get my dream on, put my whole team on
Cut some snakes off that tried to get their scheme on
Fuck it though that's life, I just bought some new ice
I just crashed a new foreign, only drove the bitch twice
I used to eat gravy and rice, now I can eat steak every night
I can take a nigga wife, I fuck her, she won't stay the night
Remember bitches tried to play me
Now them same hoes chase me
Man this lifestyle crazy
But I will never get lazy

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'
I can't fuck with niggas, they be all hatin'
It's funny how these bitches think we all datin'
Ohhh, I be heart breakin'
I can't fuck wit bitches, they be all chasin'
Drivin' in this foreign got my heart racin'
I swear I can't wait until we all make it

[Verse 2]
I swear I can't wait till we all make it
Whole team passports goin' them far places
Houses with all of them acres, rollie's with all them big faces
Ain't no more catchin' new cases, smiles on all of our faces
Man, it's crazy how we came up from nothin'
We was just on the block fuckin' hustlin'
Sellin' them rocks and duckin' them cops, fuckin' that work  all up in the pot
Beefin' with nigga's from right down the block
Pullin' all nighters and X'n out ops
Now it's all these bad bitches at my hotel
Remember my phone only used to ring for coke sales
Now I'm on tour doin' shows now
Heart racin' chasing paper on the road now

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'
I can't fuck with niggas, they be all hatin'
It's funny how these bitches think we all datin'
Ohhh, I be heart breakin'
I can't fuck with bitches they be all chasin'
Drivin' in this foreign got my heart racin'
I swear I can't wait until we all make it
