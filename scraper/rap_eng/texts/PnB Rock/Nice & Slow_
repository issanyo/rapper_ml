[Verse 1: Maliibu Mitch]
'Cause he the one I'm gon' be runnin with
Catching juggs just for the fun of it
Now he wanna give me all of it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Nice and slow
Baby, take your time with me
Nice and slow

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Lotta love for ya
I'ma tell my driver to pull up for ya
I'ma roll one up for ya
Let you hit it once
You don't smoke, girl don't choke
Hit it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Nice and slow
Baby, take your time with me
Nice and slow
