[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, ooh
Come through
Rock

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Grab my phone, call my bitch
She come through, she roll up, then I hit
We pass out, wake up, then we do it again
Dick so good she said she need to bring her friend
That’s my bitch, yeah that’s my bitch
Fuck me good, suck me good, and she count them benjamins
She got on all that designer, baby girl she the shit
She just gave me twenty pounds, she said she just hit a lick
Yeah, that’s my ride or die
She say if you get booked I’ll be by your side
She say she gon’ hold me down, in the streets she hold me down
Everything is in her name, she never trip when I stay down
You a hundred, I’m a hundred, you already know
You ain’t my girl, I ain’t your nigga, you know we just folks
We on the low ‘cause we both know it’s best if they don’t know
You can’t relax after the sex ‘cause baby I’ma roll

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl

[Verse 2: Shotty]
Roll that dope, let it burn
That’s your bitch, but she with me so it’s my turn
You keep calling, she ain’t answer, you ain’t learn?
I just fuck and give her back like a return
Yeah she love me, yeah she say she love me
But she probably want my money, that bitch can’t get nothin’ from me
We can smoke, we can fuck, we can pop a couple perks
I can turn my camera on and just sit back and watch you work
Different shit, yeah she never quit
She be all up on my dick like shawty you be on some shit
When she call and I don’t answer she know I be in the mix
But I bust back like where you at
Come through we gon’ smoke some piff
We get high, we get faded
She fuckin’ me like I made it
No Usher, we trading places
I’m biting, don’t gotta shake it
She out of breath, started pacing
Killing her, call me Jason
She tell me that I’m the best
With me there’s no replacement

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl
