[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
I was just locked in a cell, now I came home and I'm doin’ so well
These niggas they hate on me now
I don't give a fuck 'cause my momma, she proud
I know when my brother look down
We just killed the opps so I know that he smile
We smokin’ 'em straight out the pound
All these lil' bitches be burnin' me down, yeah, yeah
Lifestyle of the rich and famous
Niggas mad cause a young nigga made it, huh (Yeah, a young nigga made it)
Do the dash, yeah, a young nigga racin', huh (Skrrt, skrrt)
Young nigga made it, huh
This lifestyle amazing, huh
This lifestyle amazing

[Verse]
I was just broke goin' out sad, I swear I ain't have no cash
I was fucked up, down on my last, I had no keys to the pack
Mom kicked me out, she said I was too bad
Used to be bummy in class
Shoot my shot, all the bitches used to laugh
Dropped outta school and I turn to the trap
I was tryna pull on bitches in a Jag
When I was locked up ain't nobody have my back
I was alone with no bitches, ain’t hear from none of my niggas
But you know I wasn’t trippin' ’cause I was cooking, writing songs in my notepad
Came home and turnt up on everybody doubtin' me
I swear this shit happen so fast
Huh, look at me now
Yeah, look at my chains
Yeah, look at Bape
All of these whips, all of these chains
Diamonds they all on my teeth
When I smile you could see these VV's
Smoking opps yeah straight out the P
I know my brother he restin' in peace, yeah

[Chorus]
I was just locked in a cell, now I came home and I’m doin' so well
These niggas they hate on me now
I don't give a fuck 'cause my momma, she proud
I know when my brother look down
We just killed the opps so I know that he smile
We smokin' 'em straight out the pound
All these lil' bitches be burnin' me down, yeah, yeah
Lifestyle of the rich and famous
Niggas mad cause a young nigga made it, huh (Yeah, a young nigga made it)
Do the dash, yeah, a young nigga racin', huh (Skrrt, skrrt)
Young nigga made it, huh
This lifestyle amazing, huh
This lifestyle amazing
