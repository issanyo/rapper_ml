[Intro: PnB Rock]
Ness on the beat
Yeah
Cheffing up like Squale, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie (yeah)
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I tell my bitch that I love her but I lied (yeah)
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I told my bitch that I love her but I lied

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
You say that you're lonely, hoping that I notice
I know that it's sad how a nigga do
Then you entertain me, always baby
Get you in my bed, you leave so confused
'Cause I fuck you so good, you be all up in your feelings
I make you nut, then you tell me that you love me
Soon as we done, you be throwing shit and crying
Look, I had enough, enough, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie (yeah)
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I tell my bitch that I love her but I lied (yeah)
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I told my bitch that I love her but I lied

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, twenty women gettin' added to my roster everyday
Some from Texas, some from Cali, some do not live in the states
I'm ashamed, no I'm not
Who am I kidding, man I love it
24 with like 24 reasons to say "Fuck it"
It's so easy now
Women multiplying off my clout
To tell the truth, though, I had hoes when I was sleepin' on the couch
That's the sauce, that's the sauce
Always had it, always will
To the ones who got my real number, let me keep it real
Pour out my exes, I pour up some new ones
Please do not take pictures, you doing too much
Fuck talking, I keep it short like a crew cut
I can't fuck you if you let the whole crew fuck
It's been too long, I've been fucking you since I was tryin' to get on
And now you got a husband, now you got kids
They don't gotta know, fuck thinkin' 'bout this, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie (yeah)
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I tell my bitch that I love her but I lied (yeah)
I got some issues, I know that, I can't lie
'Cause I got a bitch, but I fuck hoes on the side
I got some issues I know that I can't hide
'Cause I told my bitch that I love her but I lied
