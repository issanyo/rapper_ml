[Verse]
I grew up without my dad
Cause he got killed by my brother's mom
Word on the street is that she stabbed him a couple times
Found out that he had another girl pregnant
Tryna let it go but but her pride wouldn't let it
Thoughts saying murder so she picked up a weapon
Knife to the chest, now there's no more Fredrick, damn
Was too young to even be sad though
Everything was all cool cause I had more
He was more than an uncle, he was more like a brother
Matter of fact he was more like my dad though
Took part of my soul when they killed him
Seven twelve oh-seven shit got real
One shot to the chest can't be real
To this day man y'all don't know how I feel
Still wanna call your phone
But I know that you won't answer, I feel all alone
Streets raised me, mom did what she could
Tryna raise five bad boys in the hood
By the age of thirteen nigga I was smoking weed
Got my hands on a gun same day I caught a jug
Kicked out the crib mom's tired of the cops knocking
Dropped out of high school, said fuck college
Just a young nigga out here with no guidance
Skinny nigga that was never scared of nobody
I caught a juvenile case, yeah they sat me down
Couple months in Arizona now I'm back around
Fuck no, no lessons learned
I came home thinkin' it's my turn
On probation still catching cases
Still smoking weed, now I'm on the run
While later, man I ran into some money
Lord knows couldn't tell me nothin'
I'm for real when they copped [?]
Wore [?] jewelry me and mean, we was stuntin'
But you know that ain't last long
Like I said I was on the run
Nigga caught another case and they sent me upstate
Hard time, wasn't nothin' fun
Whole time I was up there snappin'
No friends, no fam, what happened
No mail, no texts got a nigga catchin' wreck in the mountains
I was up there stressin'
Writin' songs made the time go by
'Till my celly said Rock you hot
I'm for real, you can probably get a deal
Matter fact let's take it to the yard outside
I spit a verse and sung a hook and they said bring it back
Young boy, you got that work, you really in your bag
Came home and I'm fucking up the game now
Niggas mad cause I rap and sing now
Hell yeah I done made my own lane now
Watch this RnB shit be flames now
Watch this RnB shit be flames now
