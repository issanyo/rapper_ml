[Chorus]
Girl, what's wrong with us just being friends?
I want you to help me understand
Love it when you ride me like a Benz
Why you tryna fuck up all these plans?
I wish I could cuff you but I can't
I wish I could love you but I can't
I just wanna fuck and blow these bands
I don't want none of this to end

[Verse 1]
Girl, you startin' to act just like my ex
Gettin' on my nerves via text
Girl, you startin' to get too attached
Girl, you startin' to get too obsessed
I understand
You know I ain't your man
You must be off the xans
You know that this wasn't in the plans
You know that we better off as friends
All that other shit ain't making sense
I understand

[Chorus]
Girl, what's wrong with us just being friends?
I want you to help me understand
Love it when you ride me like a Benz
Why you tryna fuck up all these plans?
I wish I could cuff you but I can't
I wish I could love you but I can't
I just wanna fuck and blow these bands
I don't want none of this to end

[Verse 2]
Why we can't we just be friends?
Why we can't just be cool?
Why you gotta put a label on it?
Why you gotta put a label on it?
Why you gotta put a label on it?
You know you my ride or die, you know how we ride
You know how we ride
You know how we ride
You know you my ride or die
You my ride or die
You my ride or die
You my ride or die
Shawty, hold me down
Like it's supposed to be
You was close to me
You was close to me
Why you do that shit?
How you do that shit?
You done changed up
Switch your lane up

[Chorus]
Girl, what's wrong with us just being friends?
I want you to help me understand
Love it when you ride me like a Benz
Why you tryna fuck up all these plans?
I wish I could cuff you but I can't
I wish I could love you but I can't
I just wanna fuck and blow these bands
I don't want none of this to end

[Bridge]
Girl, you know I fuck with you
Might not be in love with you
Girl, I can't cuff you
But I fuck with you
But I fuck with you
But I fuck with you
I fuck with you

[Chorus]
Girl, what's wrong with us just being friends?
I want you to help me understand
Love it when you ride me like a Benz
Why you tryna fuck up all these plans?
I wish I could cuff you but I can't
I wish I could love you but I can't
I just wanna fuck and blow these bands
I don't want none of this to end

[Refrain]
You know you my ride or die, you know how we ride
You know how we ride
You know how we ride
You know you my ride or die
You my ride or die
You my ride or die
You my ride or die
