[Hook: PnB Rock]
From the jungle where them niggas yeah they play hard
Ina trap all night pullin graveyard
Hella straps, i just got me an new AR
I got no raps outtin niggas ina graveyard

[Chorus: Lor Scoota] 2x
Nigga play we goin send em to the graveyard
Big four fifth, blow ya face off
Nigga play we goin send em to the graveyard
Shoots fired to late can't take off

[Verse 1: Lor Scoota]
Im in the trenches
You niggas is bitches
Stay in my business more than my bitches
Fuck out my face, stay in ya place
Hating ass niggas won't let me be great
They goin make me end up catching a case
He goin end up catching one to the face
Runni ya mouth, live in ya mother house
Niggas tweeting some shit they wouldn't even say
Get online, like scoota a bitch, fuck where he from I'd say it to his face
Pull in the trench with a big four fifth, niggas dont say shit, who got something to say
Pull up on a bitch, i ain't gotta say shit, she goin jump right in when she see my face
Gotta wear a mask when i do a nigga dirty, anybody can be a witness, who don't know me
It was Mr. Bird Flu, first thing they goin say, thats what the money for get you hit broad day
You got money still whore, keep it on me everyday
That nigga been a whore, I know yo from around the way
Drop another diss song you goin be ina grave

Teach ya ass how to behave, niggas mad cause im taking the wave
Ain't got no raps say my name ina rap dont let 16 bars get ya ass clapped, cause i got 16 hollows in strap, riding round dark tint windows ona AC
Heard a nigga look for me know exactly where im at

[Hook & Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lor Scoota]

Knock the bones out ya face, with this big nina
Reach for my ice get the choir singers
Come to the funeral, kill the choir singers

If I say fuck these niggas i mean it
Been itching for a body, my adrenaline kickin in
Leanin of the lean, got me bent like a kick stand
Choppa so big I can lean on this bitch man
Use it like a can beat nigga with that bitch man

[Hook & Chorus]
