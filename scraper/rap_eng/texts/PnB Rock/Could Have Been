[Chrous]
Still remember my first lick when I really got paid
Won't forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like damn what could have been
Seen me winning now she thinking what could have been
What if we could just rewind
What could have been
Is there a time limit on trying
What could have been
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been
Used to say I want your time
What could have been

[Refrain]
Haven't seen her
In a long time
Have you seen her
Can we press rewind
In a long time
Haven't seen her
I've been thinking

[Verse 1]
Every time I was in LA I was my little side bitch
Every time you would call me tripping, I was like girl stop it
I was out doing the most
I was out there fucking them hoes
I was out there smoking dope, mobbing with my bros
Yeah, you already know, and
Shawty, I been missing your style
Shawty, I been missing your smile
Shawty, I been missing the way you make me feel you've been on my mind
Like, I just wanna come back
Girl, you got me like that
That's 'cause I still think about you

[Chorus]
Still remember my first lick when I really got paid
Won't forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like damn what could have been
Seen me winning now she thinking what could have been
What if we could just rewind
What could have been
Is there a time limit on trying
What could have been
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been
Used to say I want your time
What could have been

[Refrain]
Haven't seen her
In a long time
Have you seen her
Can we press rewind
In a long time
Haven't seen her
I've been thinking

[Verse 2]
I ain't fell in love since you
Wasn't real if it wasn't you
I swear they, them bitches, they can't fuck with you
But when you left me girl, what was I supposed to do


[Chorus]
Still remember my first lick when I really got paid
Won't forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like damn what could have been
Seen me winning now she thinking what could have been
What if we could just rewind
What could have been
Is there a time limit on trying
What could have been
Thoughts be running through my mind
What could have been
Used to say I want your time
What could have been

[Refrain]
Haven't seen her
In a long time
Have you seen her
Can we press rewind
In a long time
Haven't seen her
I've been thinking

[Outro]
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been
