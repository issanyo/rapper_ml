[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ain't tryna, I ain't tryna play those games all night
Why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Girl you know, girl you know I could change your life
So why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
I ain't tryna, I ain't tryna play those games all night

[Verse 1: Monty]
Girl you somethin' special, let me sex you in your Vicky's
And you know I won't forget you, all you got to do is [?] me
And them other bitches haters, they just wish that they was with me
I sip [?], so I know you feelin' tipsy, ay
Monty, I'm a stoner, I be smokin' like a hippie
Every time she throw it back, it just keep comin' like a Frisbee
We be fuckin' all night, no this not a quickie
And she know it's on sight, 'cause I be gettin' busy, ay
Shawty, know you want it
Even though I was on it
What you playin' games for?
'Cause you know what I came for

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ain't tryna, I ain't tryna play those games all night
Why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Girl you know, girl you know I could change your life
So why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Why you tryna, why you tryna play those games all night?
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
Shawty you know that you want it
I ain't tryna, I ain't tryna play those games all night

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I ain't tryna play no games with you
Got hundreds all over the [?]
It's gon' feel like Liu Kang hit you (wah)

Let's pop a perc, you know I'm on two
Zoovier ain't playin' no games with you
[?] cruisin' in the rain with you
Uh, doin' my thing with you, ay

Pick a place you want to go to
I can make it rain with hundreds on you
I can really make you [?]
Your dreams baby, I'm really that nigga you need baby
Smokin' on [?]
We be on the xans movin' low key
And I had a couple bitches on me
And a lot of niggas [?] me
Zoovier, Zoovier, [?] this bitch [?], yah

And I really be up in these streets
I be creepin' all up in her sheets
Yeah, baby

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I ain't tryna, I ain't tryna play those games all night
