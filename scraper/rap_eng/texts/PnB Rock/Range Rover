[Chorus]
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
I was landing first class, you still on that layover
I just fucked your bitch, she keep tryna stay over
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober
Rollie all on my wrist, bitch, I ball, no assist
Smoking weed by the zip, whole squad, yeah, we lit
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober

[Verse 1]
All these cups, yeah, yeah, all these bottles
All these drugs, yeah, yeah, all these models
We get to that money, nigga, can't nothing stop us
You can do what you want, nigga, when you know you poppin'
Diamonds they dancing all up over chain
These bitches, they see me, they going insane
I take his bitch, I know that he sick
And he can't do shit 'cause I know he a lame
I'ma skrrt off in the Range
I just got offered some brain
I'm getting all of this change
My new bitch, she came from Spain

[Pre-Chorus]
Flexin', I be flexin' and finessin'
They hating, niggas hating, I got them stressed
I'm ballin', I've been ballin' for a while now
I came up super fast and they wonder how now

[Chorus]
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
I was landing first class, you still on that layover
I just fucked your bitch, she keep tryna stay over
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober
Rollie all on my wrist, bitch, I ball, no assist
Smoking weed by the zip, whole squad, yeah, we lit
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober

[Verse 2]
I ain't ever sober, super lit, yeah, that's my lifestyle
Fucked a bitch last night, she tryna be my wife now
Niggas hating, try to rob, they see all my ice now
Hitters will be right now, they'll take your life now
I was broke, now I'm rich, now I could buy any whip
Now I could fuck any bitch, taking hoes on trips
I'm throwing it up how I wanna
I move to LA for the summer
I smoke on the bus, marijuana
I feel like the number one stunna

[Pre-Chorus]
Flexin', I be flexin' and finessin'
They hating, niggas hating, I got them stressed
I'm ballin', I've been ballin' for a while now
I came up super fast and they wonder how now

[Hook]
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
I was landing first class, you still on that layover
I just fucked your bitch, she keep tryna stay over
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober
Rollie all on my wrist, bitch, I ball, no assist
Smoking weed by the zip, whole squad, yeah, we lit
Pulled up to the scene in that new Range Rover
Off weed, off lean, I don't ever stay sober
