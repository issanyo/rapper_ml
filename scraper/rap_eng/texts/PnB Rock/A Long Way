[Hook: PNB Rock & Every Ave]
I done came a long way, ain't been to sleep all day
Momma tried to warn me "watch the snakes and watch the fleas"
I been trappin' all day, thinkin' bout my homies
That ain't get to see the day, please don't think you know me
I came a long way
Runnin in and out my city, man I ain't even get no sleep all day
I know these niggas' gon talk and these hoes gon' talk
Fuck what they all say
I know you either heard that I'm hot, that I'm on, that I stopped
I was locked, that I won't, that I will
That I came through in a drop, but the facts still remain
I came a long way

[Verse 1: Quilly]
I'm on go bitch, I ain't never stoppin'
Put the work in overtime, when I clock in
Got it rockin', finally got it poppin'
Fell back from the club just to lock in
I'm hot right now, I was hot then
Lived 10 toes down, in your top ten
Fucked up cuz the system want me boxed in
I will never lose a round; keep boxing
Prayin' 5 times, Devil keep knockin'
I'm a prosper hater, keep watchin'
You don't wanna go to war like Muhammad
Ali, not me; B. Hopkins
If the work good, put it in the pot
If it's straight drop, it'll come back
If it's real love, it'll run back
It's fake love, it'll run out
Dam, the truth hurt, how you love that?
Where the love at? Where your buzz at?
I ain't never gon' fail, fuck that
You know how the game go; plus tax
Niggas' got me fucked up, think it's just rap
Talkin' bout the street life, I'm about that
On the road to riches, duckin' mouse traps
Bumps in the road, had to re-route that

[Verse 2: Quilly]
I'm the shit now, and next year
Take off; jet gears
This my best year, this my flex year
And I'm coming for your head, fuck a vest year
Spit crack, coke, dope and meth here
I'ma fuck the game up, make a mess here
Want more, never settling for less here
A nigga say he don't feel me then he can't hear
Came a long way from the dumb shit
I'ma put you niggas' on to my new shit
See, my hustle gon' put me in a new crib
Ambition gonna put me in a new whip
Motivation gon' put me wit a new bitch
You ain't never do shit, won't do shit
You ain't never hear this, this exclusive
All you do is sink ships wit your loose lips
I'm on top, she suppose to suck me
I'm him now, you suppose to want me
She said "I'm loyal, you suppose to trust me"
I'm winnin' baby, you suppose to love me
I remember when you were suppose to fuck me
I'm wavy now, these hoes is dusty
If you're lookin' for love, this the wrong way
I'm chasin' money, I had a long day
