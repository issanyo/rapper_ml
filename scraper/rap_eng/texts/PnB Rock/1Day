[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy
Momma told me that I wouldn't be shit (momma)
Told her one day (yeah)
I'ma be rich (rich)
You can kick me out (huh)
I ain't gon' trip (nah)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass crib (woot)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass mansion (mansion)
One day, all my fucking diamonds 'gon be dancing (bling)
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch in the Hamptons (woot)
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon (aye)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
One day, I'ma be that nigga like I thought
One day, I'ma buy myself a new foreign car
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch that's a porn star
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch that's a porn star
One day, I'ma fill all the arenas
I'ma be turning up on stage with my demons
I'ma buy the new Gucci suit, it's the cleanest
I'ma play with racks like I'm Venus or Serena
Momma kicked me out and I came back with tattoos
Then she kicked my ass and said boy you a damn fool
I said no, I was on my own, ain't have to ask you
I said no, this what being young and having cash do

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy
Momma told me that I wouldn't be shit (momma)
Told her one day (yeah)
I'ma be rich (rich)
You can kick me out (huh)
I ain't gon' trip (nah)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass crib (woot)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass mansion (mansion)
One day, all my fucking diamonds 'gon be dancing (bling)
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch in the Hamptons (woot)
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon (sushi)

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon
One day, I'ma fuck a groupie in a mansion
One day, I'ma fuck your boo and leave her stranded
One day, I'll be in Peru speaking Spanish
One day, I'ma put my momma in a Bentley
I remember laying down with my stomach empty
Now I'm eating steak and rocking all kinds of Fendi
Spent your rent on my neck, bitch, I'm only 20
Dropped out of college, everybody said I'm tripping
Told 'em be patient, but they ass wouldn't listen
Made it big time, now they fucking with the vision
Now I'm really rich, and my diamonds really glistening

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy
Momma told me that I wouldn't be shit (momma)
Told her one day (yeah)
I'ma be rich (rich)
You can kick me out (huh)
I ain't gon' trip (nah)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass crib (woot)
One day, I'ma buy a big ass mansion (mansion)
One day, all my fucking diamonds 'gon be dancing (bling)
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch in the Hamptons (woot)
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon (sushi)
