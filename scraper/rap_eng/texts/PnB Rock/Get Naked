Started off in the club right
Tatted up so you think I live the thug life
I ain’t trippin’ shawty you know what it’s hittin’ for
I ain’t trippin’ shawty you know what it’s hittin’ for
Walk up in this bitch, just me and my niggas

Shawty you chose once they play my song
I said [?] me you lady

[Chorus]
Well girl let’s get naked
Hold my pole and I hope you can take it
Talkin’ freaky, girl I hope you ain’t fakin’ yeah

Goddamn you sexy
Your body sayin’ stop playin’, come and get me
Girl I’d eat your ass, only if you let me
I got some things that I could do, let’s see
One, first I’m gonna start off with my tongue
And two, I’ma put it down on you
Then three, bet I put your ass to sleep
Then wake you up for four, have you screaming out for more
