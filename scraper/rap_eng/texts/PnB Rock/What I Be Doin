[Intro]
Astro on the beat
Rock
Oh yeah
Already know when you hear that man
Woo
It’s that smooth shit man
Let the beat rock out
Woo

[Chorus]
All these hoes on me ‘cause the dough on me
You know everything I wear be designer
I’m a hood nigga, so keep it hood nigga
You ain’t got to lie to me, I ain’t your honor
All I do is smoke dope, pop percs, that’s what I be doin’
Sippin’ lean, sellin’ work, that’s what I be doin’
Runnin’ ‘round out of town, that’s what I be doin’
Fuckin’ all you niggas’ hoes, that’s what I be doin’, I be doin’

[Verse 1]
A mixed stand-in, I been tryna get it
Call my phone, you ain’t talkin’ money I don’t listen
Young nigga, I remember I ain’t had shit
Nowadays I’m getting paid, living lavish
Fuckin’ all these hoes that you wish you could
You come around PnB, I still be in my hood
You try to check or disrespect me, shit I wish you would
My hitters be at your door, my nigga don’t get shook
This one for them real niggas that be in the trap
Three things I hate, cops, fakers, and rats
Fuck a fraud nigga too ‘cause I can’t stand that
And a broke ass bitch, shawty where your bands at?

[Chorus]
But you know I got all these hoes on me ‘cause the dough on me
You know everything I wear be designer
I’m a hood nigga, so keep it hood nigga
You ain’t got to lie to me, I ain’t your honor
All I do is smoke dope, pop percs, that’s what I be doin’
Sippin’ lean, sellin’ work, that’s what I be doin’
Runnin’ ‘round out of town, that’s what I be doin’
Fuckin’ all you niggas’ hoes, that’s what I be doin’, I be doin’

[Verse 2]
I be doin’ everything I say I be
I be in these streets, risking my life every day, I be
‘Cause I gotta do this, she gotta eat, fuck you mean
Gotta get that studio time every song, that’s a bean
I got a call from my brother, he said he miss me and shit
He said what’s up with them bitches, send me some pictures and shit
Max out next year then he back on the bridge
Right back to getting this money, right back to trapping and shit
My nigga money never made me, being broke did
Hate a fuck nigga that be on that ho shit
Haters talkin’ all that Rock won’t blow shit
Sit your stupid ass down, nigga you don’t know shit
Put that on my team, we gon’ eat, bitch it’s PnB
‘Til I D-I-E, R-I-P, you know what I mean
I’m screamin’ free me, and free Lean, that’s until they free
And free Tino too, that’s my crew, my D-O-N-E’s

[Chorus]
All these hoes on me ‘cause the dough on me
You know everything I wear be designer
I’m a hood nigga, so keep it hood nigga
You ain’t got to lie to me, I ain’t your honor
All I do is smoke dope, pop percs, that’s what I be doin’
Sippin’ lean, sellin’ work, that’s what I be doin’
Runnin’ ‘round out of town, that’s what I be doin’
Fuckin’ all you niggas’ hoes, that’s what I be doin’, I be doin’

[Chorus]
All these hoes on me ‘cause the dough on me
You know everything I wear be designer
I’m a hood nigga, so keep it hood nigga
You ain’t got to lie to me, I ain’t your honor
I just smoke dope, pop percs, that’s what I be doin’
Sippin’ lean, sellin’ work, that’s what I be doin’
Runnin’ ‘round out of town, that’s what I be doin’
Fuckin’ all you niggas’ hoes, that’s what I be doin’

[Outro]
Oh yeah, all I do
Yeah that’s all I do
