[Chorus]
That your girl, she with me tonight
Guess she fuckin' with the team tonight
'Cause we all young and free tonight
Yeah we all young and free
Yeah we all young and free
That your girl, she with me tonight (she with me)
Guess she fuckin' with the team tonight (fuckin' with the team)
'Cause we all young and free tonight (we young and free)
Yeah we all young and free (we young and free)
All young and free tonight (we young and free)

[Verse 1]
Young and free, that's the only way to be
This a celebration, if you smoking go into some weed
It's some paper, it's some dutches, roll it up
If you drankin', pour it up
Get some lean and pour a cup
Don't get drunk and throw it up
I just took some pictures with some bitches I don't even know
Soo just passed me some weed and he don't even smoke
Fuck it though we young and free
If you come from the scene where you wanna be
Think these hoes gon' choose, you snooze, you lose
You might just stand up in my sheets
Red cups, hookah, smoke louds
She havin' the time of her life now
She say that with me she feel alive now
I guess I should tell you right now

[Chorus]
That your girl, she with me tonight
Guess she fuckin' with the team tonight
'Cause we all young and free tonight
Yeah we all young and free
Yeah we all young and free
That your girl, she with me tonight (she with me)
Guess she fuckin' with the team tonight (fuckin' with the team)
'Cause we all young and free tonight (we young and free)
Yeah we all young and free (we young and free)
All young and free tonight (we young and free)
