[Intro]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Uh

[Chorus]
Now she see I'm getting paid now
Lil shawty on my wave now
Remember back in the days how
She ain't gimme no play, naw
Now she see me in that new whip
Now she's tryna be my new bitch
Lil shawty on my wave now
Lil shawty on my wave now

[Verse 1]
I remember you from high school
It's crazy, 'cause I wasn't always the fly dude
But I always kept it real
I wrote you a note to tell you how I feel
Yeah
It was more like a letter though
Got a crush on you and shawty I'm tryna let you know
Heard you got a boyfriend, I could treat you better though
Is you wit it or not?
Check the box, shawty, yes or no?
Remember it like it was yesterday
I had way better days
You had me so fucked up
I failed my test that day
Heard you was fuckin' with Corey
Back then he was a dope boy
Took you to the prom in a Rolls Royce
Nowadays he a broke boy damn!

[Chorus]
Now she see I'm getting paid now
Lil shawty on my wave now
Remember back in the days how
She ain't gimme no play, naw
Now she see me in that new whip
Now she's tryna be my new bitch
Lil shawty on my wave now
Lil shawty on my wave now

[Verse 2]
She see a young nigga lit
Now she wan hop in my whip
Nah bitch, eat a dick .
Where was you when I was broke?
Where was you when I was low?
Now you see a nigga glo'd up
Yeah, a nigga got older
Pockets lookin' like boulders
Yeah
I can't lie, I would still fuck you
But bitch you would be lucky if I fucked you
I know I could never ever trust you
You a eater
I don't need ya
Nowadays she tryna kick it with me
Guess back then she ain't see the potential in me
But I know she feelin' played now
'Cause she's tryna ride my wave now

[Chorus]
Now she see I'm getting paid now
Lil shawty on my wave now
Remember back in the days how
She ain't gimme no play, naw
Now she see me in that new whip
Now she's tryna be my new bitch
Lil shawty on my wave now
Lil shawty on my wave now
