[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Hey, it's nice to meet you
Have you ever had a threesome?
Yeah, I know that's random
But have you ever been that speechless
Girl you got ate but do you eat
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
Shawty I know you a freak, shawty I know you a freak
Have you ever came five times back to back while a nigga grabbed your neck?
Have you ever used ice with the whipped cream?
Shawty is you into that?
Have you ever got your back blew out?
Got your tracks pulled out?
Had you tapping out, yeah
