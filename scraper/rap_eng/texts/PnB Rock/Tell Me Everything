[Chorus]
Girl confide to me
You can tell me everything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything
Girl confide to me
You can tell me anything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything

[Verse 1]
Hey, it's nice to meet you
Have you ever had a threesome
Yeah I know that's random
But have you ever been less speechless
Yeah you got ate, but do you eat
Have you ever had sex on the beach
Shawty, I know you a freak
Shawty, I know you a freak
Have you ever came 5 times back to back while a nigga grabbed your neck
Have you ever used the ice with the whipped cream, shawty is you into that
Have you ever
Got your back blew out
Got your tracks pulled out
Had you tapping out

[Chorus]
Girl confide to me
You can tell me everything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything
Girl confide to me
You can tell me anything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been on a flight
Have you ever been so high
And drunk you though your mind
Oh, have you ever been
Have you ever been
Naked
You don't even know how you got naked
Have you ever been so faded
Woke up the next morning like "girl I think I'm pregnant"

[Chorus]
Girl confide to me
You can tell me everything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything
Girl confide to me
You can tell me anything
Girl, don't you lie to me
I won't judge, girl I just wanna see that side of you
That no one has seen
Tell me everything
Tell me everything
