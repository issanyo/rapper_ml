[Intro]
Woo!
O-O-O-O-Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feelin' like Diddy now

[Chorus]
Hey!
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now

[Verse 1]
P-P-PNB Rock, bitch, this my fuckin' summer (oh yeah)
Y'all gon' see me everywhere flexin', yeah I'm stuntin'
Brand new bankroll, pocket full of hunnids
I don't fuck wit' rap niggas, I do what I wanna
Fuck no you can't get no hook
Fuck no you can't get no feature
Fuck no, don't wanna hear yo' demo
Pussy nigga I don't need you, pussy nigga I will see you
Boy, don't let me catch yo' ass in traffic with this automatic
With no hesitation, I swear I'ma blast it, I don't do no actin'
I was livin' in abandoned houses
Now record labels fly me out
I'm in the mix, I ain't hidin' out
Got some new guns, tryna try 'em out
All the real niggas they fuck wit' me
All the real bitches they fuck wit' me
All the bad bitches they fuck wit' me
Niggas, they know they can't fuck wit' me

[Chorus]
Hey!
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now

[Verse 2]
Young nigga flex
Young nigga flex
Slang that dope, that coke, them perks, that lean
[?]
PnB we got the city, homie
They told me [?], be humble youngin'
They tell me that money is gettin' to me
They told me that dope and them bitches gettin' to me
C-Can't lie feels good I done came up
Top down in that foreign switchin' lanes up
All my niggas in my family, I won't change up
Got these niggas scared, I'm 'bout to fuck the game up

[Chorus]
Hey!
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now
I'm winnin', I'm feelin' like Diddy now
I got the keys to the city now
Remember I used to wear hand-me-downs
Bitches I'm signin' they titties now
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Bently now
Countin' blue hunnids and fifties now
They got me rockin' Givenchy now (Damn)
I swear these niggas don't hear me now

[Outro]
Damn
Feelin' like Diddy now
