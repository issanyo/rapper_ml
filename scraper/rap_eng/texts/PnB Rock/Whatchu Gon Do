[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
When you out there stuck in these streets
Tell me what you gon' do
When them niggas tell you
That your man got killed up the street
Tell me how you gon' live
When your brother got bit
And you gotta help take care of the kids
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
Tell me how you gon' live
When you out there in these streets

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Tell me what you gon' do
When that pressure on
I got dogs down the road that ain't comin' home
Try to give them niggas life so I just buy 'em phones
Man they gave my niggas life, yeah they did 'em wrong
Lately I been goin' real crazy, they can't stop this
Yesterday they locked up twenty niggas in my 'partments
Sometimes I just feel like I need Jesus, I see darkness
Seen my dog's brains layin' on them streets, that shit scarred me
I know what I'm gon' do
When that pressure on
Ain't gon' fold, ain't gon' tell when that pressure come
Ain't gon' never leave my dog if he right or wrong
I'ma stand up like a man, that's just what I was taught

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
When you out there stuck in these streets
Tell me what you gon' do
When them niggas tell you
That your man got killed up the street
Tell me how you gon' live
When your brother got bit
And you gotta help take care of the kids
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
Tell me how you gon' live
When you out there in these streets
Tell me how you gon'

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I pray we never fall
So I'ma ball for my dogs
The ones locked behind the walls
In the grave or in the cell
Lord knows they need my help and I'm there
I'm tryna run up a couple millions and get my niggas out the system
God knows I really miss 'em, god knows I really miss 'em
Been a while since I seen you, Glock 40 with the beamer
Had to bust a couple niggas for my niggas
I never ever screwed up my niggas
We all gon' ride or die for my niggas
I know once that pressure on
You never break or never fold
That's that shit that gets you rolled
You never go against the code for nobody
And if you stand tall you rock solid
And if you stand tall you rock solid

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
When you out there stuck in these streets
Tell me what you gon' do
When them niggas tell you
That your man got killed up the street
Tell me how you gon' live
When your brother got bit
And you gotta help take care of the kids
Tell me how you gon' eat
Tell me how you gon' sleep
Tell me how you gon' live
When you out there in these streets
Tell me how you gon'
