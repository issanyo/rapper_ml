[Intro]
New Lane
Yeah bitch, you know that's the gang
Swear we ain't nothin' like these motherfuckin' lames
I ain't never ever switched up, I'm the same

Run around and do a nigga dirty
Niggas gon' hate, can't hurt me
I'ma pull up, you know nigga I don't give a fuck
Strapped everyday like wassup

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm strapped like wassup
Layin' in the cut
I ain't never ever give a fuck
I be posted in the tuck
I'll roll you up like a dutch
Nigga you can pull up if you want
Nigga tell me wassup
You don't wanna tell me what's up
'Cause you know my bro got the heater

And she sipping more margaritas
She tryna get fucked

You know I'm gonna shoot
And you know that's the truth
Yeah bitch you know I got the juice
You know I got the sauce

And she got a friend with her too
And I hit the bitch too

We should put a hole in your eye
