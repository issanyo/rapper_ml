[Intro]
I can’t find real luv
Yeah Yeahhh
Real luv

[Verse 1]
It was something about your eyes when I met you
Yeah I swear I caught a vibe when I met you
Yeah I swear I fell in love when I text you
Cause they way you fucking talk was intellectual
Member all the times I came to your rescue
Had to wipe your fucking eyes cause they recked you
Used to hit it from the side when I sexed you
God I gotta thank your mom cause she blessed you
Yeah you used to hit my line get faded
I remember all the times we'd get wasted
Girl I used to drop you off on the west side
Used to hit it from the back that’s your best side

[Chorus]
I can’t trust or think now
All that’s on my brain now
I can’t find real love now
Some feel like a drug
You know I thought about you last night
I was on my last flight
I can’t find real love now
And you know it, yeah you know it, yeah you know it

[Verse 2]
Since the last time
I been fucking all these hoes just to past time
I remember when I used to give you all my time
I know you would break my heart just show me all the signs
This shit is crazy used to be my baby
I’m really ready for you to play me
You really tried it
Used to be my bitch
You really lied bitch and now I hope you die bitch

[Chorus]
And I can’t trust or think now
All that’s on my brain now
I can’t find real luv now
Some feel like a drug
You know I thought about you last night
I was on my last flight
I can’t find real luv now
And you know it, yeah you know it, yeah you know it
