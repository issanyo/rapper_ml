[Intro: PnB Rock]
Turnin' over on you fuckboys
Fuck bitches too

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
I'm turnin' over, turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
In the kitchen whippin' yola, mix it with the soda
Bitch I'm gone, smokin' strong, you can smell the odor
Nigga really think he Tony, bitch I think I'm Sosa
Hatin' niggas, hatin' bitches, got me turnin' over
I done smoked so much dope today
A nigga can't even think straight
And I done chopped so many O's today
I'm feelin' like a fuckin' sensei
Niggas' vibes tellin' me they been fake
Niggas' eyes tellin' me they been snake
They be the same niggas screamin' they your dog
But they'll kill your ass for less than 10K
'Cause these niggas ain't shit and these hoes ain't neither
Only bitch I love is my best friend Nina
'Cause she never did me wrong and she always held me down
Nigga act crazy, she gon' RIP 'em
Jaws ask me why I trap shit, I say 'cause
It give me clothes, give me hoes, and it give me buzz
They ain't my family, but these fiends, shit they show me love
The life of a trapstar, I'ma live it up

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
I'm turnin' over, turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over

[Verse 2: PnB Chizz]
Them boys don't want no bodies at all
My twenty-two hold ten and ten, boy you better step off
No I ain't the ref, so get me stressed, I let this TEC off
Only one thing left to do nigga, that's ball
These fake friends bad for business
I'ma start collecting rent from these tenants
Other side the pillow is always cooler
I'm turning over on all of you niggas
Only stay around to be in my business
Want to know every word in my sentence
Listen when it's war time a lot of bulls die
I'm droppin' bombs 'til all of you finished
Don't pay your rent, where you gon' stay?
And you turn up like all the way
Every day, every day
You tryna find a new fee
When I run shit they boom-by-yay
If you run shit don't come my way
Shit the boy to boy time 'bout to go
You ain't know, shit they call me Bobby Bouchet

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
I'm turnin' over, turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
