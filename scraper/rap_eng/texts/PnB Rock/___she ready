[Intro: PnB Rock]
Earl on the beat

Mmm, yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, aye

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
She said she wanna be my main bitch, aye
She think she ready to be famous, aye (Yeah)
She said she wanna be my wife, aye (Yeah)
She think ready for this life, yeah, yeah
You really think you ready for this life? (Whoa)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride (Whoa)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Quick camera flash, brand new Herm√®s bag
Benz truck, ride it fast, don't you dare ever look back
I can change your life, gotta make sure that you right for me
Make your wildest dreams everyday reality
Ooh, everyday steak is for dinner, havin' good sex in a Sprinter
Your last nigga was a renter, well girl, I'm a buyer
Pirelli all on my tires, I'll tell your boss you quit if you not already fired
I love gettin' wires, counting up, counting up, count
All these Ms in my account, lift up the truck with a mount
Hittin' home runs like Jeter, 'bout to go cop me a brand new two-seater
I been knew that you was a eater, that's why I fuck with you
I feel like I'm stuck with you, I need you to come on through
Just pass this test or two

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
She said she wanna be my main bitch, aye
She think she ready to be famous, aye (Yeah)
She said she wanna be my wife, aye (Yeah)
She think ready for this life, yeah, yeah
You really think you ready for this life? (Whoa)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride (Whoa)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
All these camera lights, shawty, welcome to the life
All these diamonds, all this ice, shawty, I could treat you right (Yeah)
You could be my main, introduce you to the fame (Fame)
Put you on a private plane, shawty, just don't ever change (Nah)
And we can go straight to the top (Yeah), we can be countin' this guap (Yeah)
And we can be takin' trips to different cities, just me and you all in a drop
I just got that new McLaren (Yeah), oh, that's that new Gucci you wearin' (Gucci)
Just got some new titties and matching new ass, that's why these niggas they starin'
And they mad 'cause you rollin' with me, you keep that pussy soakin' for me
And I don't really care what they try to say, 'cause you out in the open with me
When I usually keep it low-key
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me, girl, you look like a star with me

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
She said she wanna be my main bitch, aye (Be my main)
She think she ready to be famous, aye (Famous, yeah)
She said she wanna be my wife, aye (Be my wife, yeah)
She think ready for this life, yeah, yeah (Is you ready for this life?, yeah)
You really think you ready for this life? (For this life, whoa)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride (Whoa, is you gon' ride?)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me (If you gon' ride)
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me (You on the side of me, yeah)
