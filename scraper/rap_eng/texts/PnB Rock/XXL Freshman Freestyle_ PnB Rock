[Verse]
Oh, yeah
Last year I was locked up, I was in a cell
This year now I'm on charts, I'ma give 'em hell
Been through a lot of shit
Before I ever seen the fame and the glory
Before you judge me and think you above me
Lemme tell you a story
Yeah, let me take you way back
I'm talkin' way, way before the deal
Yeah, I'm talkin' way, way back
Back when shit was super real
My mama have five boys
Three baby daddies, two of 'em got killed
The other one was a deadbeat
Might as well say that nigga got killed
Growin' up without a dad
Always had it bad, we was in and out of shelters
Crazy how we had family all around the world
And really, ain't nobody really help us
My mama went and got a boyfriend that beat her ass
I remember feelin' helpless
Swear, I wish I could fucking catch him
Swear, man, I would fuckin' wet him
Yeah, shit, uh
Man, it's crazy how the times change
'Cause lately I've been in a different mind frame
And lately I've been thinkin' 'bout the bigger picture
Thinkin' 'bout my brother, man, I miss that nigga
When he got killed that night I wish that I was with that nigga
Swear, I wish heaven was like jail when I could visit niggas
Speakin' of visits, I'm screaming "free Shotty"
Can't even lie, I need the go see Shotty
Lately I've been trippin', I've been actin' different
I've been fake busy, I've been fuckin' all these bitches
Sometimes I got caught up in the fame
But my loyalty to you will never change, bro, don't get it twisted
My mama and my baby mama say that I been distant
But really I just been takin' care of business
Think about this shit in a couple months
Leave it up to me and we all gon' be livin' different
I'm talkin' big houses, big cars, and big business
I'm tryna put my niggas in the good position
I'm tryna pay Milan whole school tuition
So she ain't gotta worry 'bout these fuck niggas
I'm teachin' her right now not to trust niggas
And anything that she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
And everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Oh, yeah
