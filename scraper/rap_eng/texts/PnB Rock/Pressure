[Intro]
Monsta's gon' tear it up
I swear it's like
Every time me and Slade get together, like, shit just be crazy

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's crazy how the times change
'Cause lately I've been in a different mind frame
And lately I've been thinkin' 'bout the bigger picture
Thinkin' 'bout my brother, man, I miss that nigga
When he got killed that night I wish that I was with that nigga
Swear, I wish heaven was like jail when I could visit niggas
Speakin' of visits, I'm screaming "free Shotty"
Can't even lie, I need the go see Shotty
Lately I've been trippin', I've been actin' different
I've been fake busy, I've been fuckin' all these bitches
Sometimes I get caught up in the fame
But my loyalty to you will never change, bro, don't get it twisted
My mama and my baby mama say that I been distant
But really I just been takin' care of business
Think about this shit in a couple months
Leave it up to me and we all gon' be livin' different
I'm talkin' big houses, big cars, and big business
I'm tryna put my niggas in the good position
I'm tryna pay Milan whole school tuition
So she ain't gotta worry 'bout these fuck niggas
I'm teachin' her right now not to trust niggas
Anything that she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me

[Chorus]
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
Everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure
Goin' through this pressure
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure

[Verse 2]
The other day I had my first show in Cali
The same day they told me that they killed Saddi
I still had to go out and perform and act like it wasn't nothing going on to please everybody
And that shit hurt my heart I swear I shed so many tears
I lost so many friends, I suffered through the years
I feel like Pac, I got all eyes on me
And they be out here tellin' all these lies on me
And niggas out here saying they gon' slide on me
Like they ain't know I had the flame
Like they ain't know about the gang, until I put on a chain
Bust down, new lane
Niggas saying nothing changed, like we supposed to be the same
I can't trust these niggas, I done learned my lesson
All these diamonds on me, they came from the pressure
I can't lie, I've been living reckless
All these blogs man they got a nigga stressing
All these hoes man they out here being extra
Niggas out here asking for my extras
They be hating 'cause I'm flexing in my section
I can't lie, all this shit a blessing
They wouldn't be hating if I was out here doing nothing
Everything I got is from the muscle
If you don't fuck with me then nigga, then it's fuck you
I'm just out here fighting through this...

[Chorus]
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
Everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure
Goin' through this pressure
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
