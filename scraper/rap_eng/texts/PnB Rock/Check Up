[Intro: PnB Rock & Leeky Bandz]
Got it on smash
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just got my check up
Juggin' 'cause it take too long to stack up (fuck that shit)
I just took this lil bitch and finessed her (finessed that bitch)
Once I fuck her take too long to text her (I won't text that bitch)
Huh, yeah, I'm a flexer (flexer)
I just put some Gucci on my left (Gucci)
All my niggas lookin' for some wreck, yeah (yeah)
Heard you got that bag, we at your neck, yeah (gimme that shit)

[Verse 1: Leeky Bandz]
On mama I get it by any means
I be with them niggas that's look at me
And them looks ain't the scene as same anything
Mama said I couldn't get it, got everything
If I want it I get it, on everything
Once I hit I can't get her no wedding ring
If I run in your trap I want everything
Ain't no cappin', my niggas be kickin' doors
Niggas cap in they rappin', I love it though
Plug said he got percs, I ain't in to those
Been mastered the P, no limit though
I was bangin' on the door, y'all ain't hear it though
Plug said he got work out in Mexico
Told my mama if I don't make it I dead it
And I did it for me, hope you feel it
Used to post on the block with gorillas
Stain game, if you got it I get it
Don't make it with rap then I'm flippin'
Seen niggas get fired for a pigeon
Nigga think he gon' fly then we get him
Spin back two times if we ain't hit him
Opps never outside when we be spinnin'
Opps never outside, they know we with it
I ain't from SoHo, I'm from the trenches (gang, go)

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just got my check up
Juggin' 'cause it take too long to stack up (fuck that shit)
I just took this lil bitch and finessed her (finessed that bitch)
Once I fuck her take too long to text her (I won't text that bitch)
Huh, yeah, I'm a flexer (flexer)
I just put some Gucci on my left (Gucci)
All my niggas lookin' for some wreck, yeah (yeah)
Heard you got that bag, we at your neck, yeah (gimme that shit)

[Verse 2: Leeky Bandz]
You can't finesse a finesser
Wish that boy would like a dresser
Call the drug then got my check up
Went to the gym, I been flexin'
We used to bag up the extras
I don't want her, she too extra
All of my niggas is reckless
We take your chain, leave you neckless
We be icy any weather
If she jack it I won't sweat her
This shit is different
We winnin' and my niggas come from the trenches
That bag on my neck, know you feel it
You broke, go and get out your feelings
Get to that bag, make a living
Got my bag up, yeah I did it
Got the cheat code so we winnin'
Scotty 2 Hotty, no Pippen
If it ain't broke I don't fix it
When a boss talkin', you listen
When a boss talkin', you listen, ayy
Blowin' up my phone, I just got an O, hey
Blowin' up my phone, I just got an O, hey
Blowin' up my phone, that's another zoe, hey
Flexin', flexin', flexin', flexin', then I go, hey

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just got my check up (go)
Juggin' 'cause it take too long to stack up (fuck that shit)
I just took this lil bitch and finessed her (finessed that bitch)
Once I fuck her take too long to text her (I won't text that bitch)
Huh, yeah, I'm a flexer (flexer)
I just put some Gucci on my left (Gucci)
All my niggas lookin' for some wreck, yeah (yeah)
Heard you got that bag, we at your neck, yeah (gimme that shit)
