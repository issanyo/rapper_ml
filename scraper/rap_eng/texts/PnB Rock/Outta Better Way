[Chorus]
Stressin' every day, sinnin' every day
Runnin' in and out of jail, this shit is in the way
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way
Better way, a better way
I get high all the time just to get away
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way

[Verse]
Gotta be a better way
Better yet a better life
In and out of jail, got my fuckin' mind stressin' life
When is you gon' grow up? when is you gon' change your ways?
When is you gon' stop smokin' pot and percs and slangin' yay
I don't know the answer so I say a long while
This the cutter, I guess I was meant to be a rider
Meant to be upstate, sittin' in the cell
Missin' my bitches, my family, my niggas in other jails
Twenty-two years old, goin' down the wrong road
Dead or in jail, they say that's where I'm finna go
But I been to jail, shit they couldn't hold me down
So I guess my next step is dead stiff up in the ground
But fuck that, 'cause no I ain't ready to go yet
I still ain't get a deal, no I still ain't blow yet
I still just had a daughter and ain't seen her grow yet
Prayin' for a better day since they ain't take my soul yet
Said I'm

[Chorus]
Stressin' every day, sinnin' every day
Runnin' in and out of jail, this shit is in the way
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way
Better way,  be a better way
I get high all the time just to get away
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way

[Outro]
Ooh, better way
To myself it gotta be a better way
Ooh, gotta be a better way
Ooh
