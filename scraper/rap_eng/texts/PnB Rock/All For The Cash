[Hook: PnB Rock]
I'm getting all of this cash, I put it all in a bag
Smoking on all of this gas, might just pull up in a Jag
Dripping with all of this swag, these bitches be calling me dad
I'm popping all of these tags, that's why these niggas is mad
Yeah these niggas is mad
Yeah, that's why these niggas is mad
All these niggas is mad
Yeah these niggas, they mad
That's why these niggas, they mad

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I'm coming straight out the sewer
I made me some mula so now I'm the chosen one
Straight to the jeweler, they see the face on the Mueller
Just wait 'til the Rolex come
I was driving a hoopty, a stolen one
My passenger strapped with a loaded gun
You getting too close, where I know you from?
All these drugs got me going numb
Bagging green like a lawnmower
Had a few grams, had to start lower
Got a car show in my garage door
Valentino sneakers cost Chicago
Bitch get me shows overseas for me
Bitch roll up this weed for me
She make sure I never leave horny
Cause every time she put that thing on me
We pull up, they poppin' the vents
Hop out the Benz, and I got that thing on me
She see the chain and the rings on me
You thought it was crack, [?] kings only
They talking but I do not hear 'em yet
Niggas hatin', guess they still upset
They leaving comments and they sending threats
I got hitters with me when I'm the jects

Yeah these niggas is mad
Yeah, that's why these niggas is mad
All these niggas is mad
Yeah these niggas, they mad

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Racks on me
Bet I got the stacks on me
You can smell this gas on me
Cause bitch I got that sack on me
I been ballin' for a while, I get money by the pound
Bitches ain't want me before, all them hoes they want me now
Girl you should've stuck around, now you wanna fuck around
You want me because I'm up, where was you when I was down?
I used to be broke but I'm rich
Yeah I done come up with my niggas
It's dope in the water, no swishers
I use the same clothes, all my pictures
It's five in the morning, I'm working
I'm killing these niggas on purpose
I walk in the mall and I'm splurging
I'm wavy young nigga, I'm surfing

Yeah these niggas is mad
Yeah, that's why these niggas is mad
All these niggas is mad
Yeah these niggas, they mad
That's why these niggas, they mad
