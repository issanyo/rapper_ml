Some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day Yea
But some how some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Remember having 50 cent to my name
A quarter juice and some hot flames
We were sitting on the couch watching He Got Game
My homie could have been Jordan but he got changed
Yeah youngin and had hoop dreams
But I know a few things
That I can serve prolly get some Jordans and some new jeans
The main objective was to make it out
By any means if I find out where to plug stay I'm stakin out
A long ways to go but look how far we came
You can look into a nigga eyes you can see the pain
Everybody witchu when it's sunny that's the game
But 99% uh niggas leave when it rain
My neighborhood dream killin
Life stealin
He wanna be a hitter till he got life in prison
Racist ass police jus tryna convict em
It's crazy cuz 9 Outta 10 he'll be a victim

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day Yea
But some how some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Uh, look, All them homicides
Had a nigga traumatized
You know I apologize
Fa all them times my momma cried
A couple partners died
I miss ma fallen soldiers
Fa them I'm spittin fire like the kid got halitosis
They call us vultures
But, we ain have no coaches
Nothing in the fridge, Lotta rats Lotta roaches
Same city as Obama and Oprah
But niggas 13 totin guns they'll smoke ya
Now I'm about ta open up
They ain't have no hope for us
I ain't never seen Ye'
He ain't never show us nun
Inna hood every day, serving all the smokers
Young nigga gettin older
Heart got alot colder
Right from wrong, shit, nobody never showed us
I mine as well listen ta this devil on ma shoulders
I had a dream I was whippin Inna rover
So I chased the dream
Got the cream
Out the hood by any means

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day Yea
But some how some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Kill the Opps and wake up and jugg some days
Just ta make sure that my family good some day
