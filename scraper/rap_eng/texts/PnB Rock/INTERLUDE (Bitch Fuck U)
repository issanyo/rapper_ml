[Verse]
Bitch you can slide
It's crazy, I thought that you would be mine (Mine, mine)
But you broke my heart into pieces
I let down my guard with no defense
You said you really loved me, did you mean it? (Mean it)
Swear your finesse game is the meanest
Had me thinkin’ you'd be by my side
You was finna slide
Said you was gon' ride
Bitch you fucking lied
I hope that you die (Die, die)
I hope that you die
Told me that you love me and you looked me in my eye
Found out that you out here fucking all these other guys (Guys)
Got me looking stupid
Fuck you bitch, fuck cupid
Got you number bitch I wish I never used it
You the type of bitch I should’ve let the crew hit
That's the real, bitch that's how I feel
I just popped a pill
So high in my feelings don't take it for granted
Bitch I just bought you a bust down, don't give no fucks now, I need my chain back
Never again, regret it goddamn, I already claimed that
And you got me out here fucking all these bitches tryna get my name back
