[Intro: Snow Tha Product]
Then I hit you back like "Something isn't..."
You say you working, you say you tired
Then I hit you back like "Something isn't right"
I say I'm working, I'm on my grind
Then you texting me like "Something's on your mind"

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
You be calling me up anytime
Why, you be all up in my timeline
Constantly stressing me then when I need you
You say you too busy to find time
Then I be blowing your line
I'm calling you back to back
I'm like "Why can't we get it together?"
I swear neither one of us is in our right mind

[Hook: Snow Tha Product & PnB Rock]
Then I tell you "You ain't shit" and then we fight
And then we fight, yeah
Then I hit your line like "Everything's alright"
Alright

And then we fight, yeah
And you hit me up like "Everything's alright"
Everything is alright
And then I call it quits, you crossed the line

And then tomorrow everything's alright
Everything is alright
And we both say "This is it, it, it" and then we fight
Oh yeah
And then it's right back one more time

I be calling you up any time, right
Ain't you supposed to be my wife?
Girl you be tripping, you swear I be slipping
Whole time I be out here on my grind
Why ain't you up when I find time?
No matter what you think I'm lying
You swear I be letting go, I'm always waiting girl

You the one for me and that's the difference
