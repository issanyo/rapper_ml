[Hook: PnB Rock]
I put that shit on my mom
I ain't stopping I'm gon' keep on dropping bombs
Squeezing triggers for my niggas I'm gon' ride
For my niggas I'mma
I put that shit on my mom, on my mom, on my mom
I put that shit on my mom, on my mom, on my mom
I put that shit on my mom
Squeezing triggers for my niggas I'mma ride
I put that shit on my mom

[Verse 1: Omelly]
I put it on my momma
I'm ready for the drama
I stay strapped with llamas
Keep fucking up my belts and they designers
I ain't worried about you robbers
I got some ladders you can climb up
All my niggas with me put in work nigga, ya we get it popping
I be up in the spot cocking the dot four and a half in my pot
How the fuck you don't know what that is
You keep on talking about hugging the block
Keep it real hommie do you hustle or not
I do it for the real niggas tucking the Glock
Hanging out the sun roof busting the wop
And I ain't pulling over for the law fuck the cops
Mask up on these niggas, I strap up with these bitches
I go hard in the field don't cross that line you gon' get it
I'm on deck with the shooters so you know damn right that they with it
I'mma always be trill real nigga real nigga let's get it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Omelly]
I put it on my mom and I'm ready for shit
Still strapped taking brodies man we heavy as shit
Niggas want a problem they be clapping a fifth
We ain't arguing with you niggas man we letting it rip
Big four pound heavy metal and shit
Big face Rollie heavy bezel and shit
Meek told niggas that its levels to this shit
They said I couldn't make it 'til I tweak that wrist
Now I'm outchea, two straps on me no fear
I know you sucker niggas hating on me who cares
Shit I'm stepping the mall black Balenciagas
Then I [?] bought two pairs
Laughing at these niggas that be thinking that we slipping
Got the pocket rocket on me
Talking heavy on the web but I person you be bitching
You got one more time and then them shooters gon' be ripping
You know the rules to the game go hard no snitching
Free my dawgs that's locked in the system
They want a hundred for the bail
Same night I'mma get them

[Hook]

[Outro: PnB Rock]
I put that shit on my mom, on my mom, on my mom
I put that shit on my mom, on my mom, on my mom
I put that shit on my mom
Squeezing triggers for my niggas I'mma ride
I put that shit on my mom
