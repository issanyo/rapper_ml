I been ballin' for a while, I get money by the pound
Fuck a checkup, it's okay, I'm 'bout to cash a check right now
All this money long, I done probably blew a hundred thou
I spent that on clothes, chicken, bitches, backwoods, and loud, ayy
I did it all with my squad, I wouldn't be shit without squad
Remember we was at the bottom, now we post up at the top
Balmain's with the Maison Margiela's
Got these niggas sick, they hating, they jealous
Taking over, the only option is let us
Bossed up, it ain't shit you could tell us
Bout to go fuck me some x's up
Used to whip coke on the regular
Broke niggas, they can't stand next to us

All these bad bitches we scorin'
Look how we came up from nothin'

Got your ho all in my whip c-c-cause she say she love my style
I was broke but now I'm rich, took your bitch to Mr. Chao's
Had to take her to the strip, make her off a couple pounds, ayy
Ballin', drivin' in them foreigns, kill 'em, bring them coffins
Oh yeah, we do that often, ayy
I'm finessin', drippin' swag, ayy
I be flexin' when I dab, ayy
Niggas broke, niggas mad, ayy
Put whatever on my tab, ayy
It feels good to get this money, spend it with my gang
It feels good when I walk by and bitches scream my name
Everyday I'm smokin' loud and I be sippin' lean
Everyday it's fifty thousand in my Balmain jeans
