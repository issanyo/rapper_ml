[Intro]
Got it on smash

[Pre-Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Foreign Spanish jawn, really like the lemonade
I put Cartiers all over my bitch's face
She just got a pair, all because a nigga paid
Put her in the past, 'cause you know

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & PnB Rock]
Yeah, you know, I smashed
Yeah, I smashed, yeah
Shawty let me smash
So I put her in the past, yeah
I put her in the past
Yeah, I smashed, yeah
Yeah, you know, I smashed (yeah)
So I put her in the past, yeah
Yeah I put her in the smash

[Verse: PnB Rock]
She rock Carti' frames, sweet like candy canes
If I'm Superman, she my Lois Lane
Gucci everything, Louis everything
Had to cut her off, she sniff too much 'caine
Don't look so surprised, all she want to do is lie
Then she turned around and cried, demons all in her eyes
She don't feel no pain, she might be insane
Colder than some rain, pussy lemonade

[Pre-Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Foreign Spanish jawn, really like the lemonade
I put Cartiers all over my bitch's face
She just got a pair, all because a nigga paid
Put her in the past, 'cause you know

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Yeah, you know, I smashed
Yeah, I smashed, yeah
Shawty let me smash so I put her in the past, yeah
I put her in the past
Yeah, I smashed, yeah
Yeah, you know, I smashed so I put her in the past, yeah
Yeah I put her in the smash
