[Verse 1]
Hotel room key
Bottle of Cîroc plus you and me
Candles lit, damn you sexy
I’ma treat your body like a plate of spaghetti

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma eat it up, I’ma put it down
You know what it is every time I come around
Yeah I’ma have you screaming my name
Your legs gonna be shaking along with the bedframe
I’ma fuck you real good
Like a real nigga should
I’ma show you what is up
A boss, you know I’ma keep it thug
Like a real nigga should
You gon’ love it when I go down south
They way I use my tongue, I bet that you say oohwee
Yeah I can make you cum and bust like an uzi, bust like an uzi
Then roll over and smoke
This weed and the sex is so dope
But shawty you already know

[Chorus]
I’ma fuck you real good
Good, good, good, good, good, good
I’ma fuck you real good
Good, good, good, good, good, good
I’ma do it right
Right, right, right, right, right, right
We gon’ do it all night
Night, night, night, night, night, night
Fuck you real good

[Verse 2]
Started on the bed
Now we on the floor
Pullin’ on your hair
Got you beggin’ me for more
Arch your back, throw it back at me
Girl you gon’ love it when you call me your daddy

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma beat it up, I’ma put it down
Yeah I’m the king of freak and baby I should wear the crown
Yeah I’ma have you screaming my name
Your legs gonna be shaking along with the bedframe
I’ma fuck you real good
Like a real nigga should
I’ma show you what is up
A boss, you know I’ma keep it thug
Like a real nigga should
You gon’ love it when I go down south
They way I use my tongue, I bet that you say oohwee
Yeah I can make you cum and bust like an uzi, bust like an uzi
Then roll over and smoke
This weed and the sex is so dope
But shawty you already know

[Chorus]
I’ma fuck you real good
Good, good, good, good, good, good
I’ma fuck you real good
Good, good, good, good, good, good
I’ma do it right
Right, right, right, right, right, right
We gon’ do it all night
Night, night, night, night, night, night
Fuck you real good

[Verse 3]
Okay, let’s play
Ain’t no more Cîroc, I got some Rosé
Candles out, we both tipsy
Off to the Jacuzzi, shawty roll with me
See girl I know I’m young
But baby I’m a pro
Have you biting on your lip when I go down low
I’ma have you screaming my name
Your legs gonna be shaking along with the bedframe

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma fuck you real good
Like a real nigga should
I’ma show you what is up
A boss, you know I’ma keep it thug
Like a real nigga should
You gon’ love it when I go down south
They way I use my tongue, I bet that you say oohwee
Yeah I can make you cum and bust like an uzi, bust like an uzi
Then roll over and smoke
This weed and the sex is so dope
But shawty you already know

[Outro]
I’ma fuck you up so good
I’ma fuck you up so good
I’ma fuck you up so good
Wooh-who, yeah
