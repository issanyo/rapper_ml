[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you got me open, so high off your love
Like a cloud, I'm floatin'
It's so crazy, I caught all these emotions
I fell for you hard, without even knowing
I can't think straight, I can't sleep
Without you layin' here next to me
Got my heart on my sleeve
But that's only for you, girl
Hold on what you do, girl
But you got a nigga going, yeah yeah
They say the devil wears Prada
Girl, that may be true
'Cause, girl, you stay in some designer
Used to be my boo
But now you left me, I can't find another girl like you
Now I'm stuck with all these problems, yeah yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I fell for you, it's her curse on me
And then she's turned out worse than me
This bitch is crazy
This bitch is crazy
I think 'bout trying to let her go, it just might get too personal
I'm too wavy
I'm too wavy
And I've been back to you, I ain't hear shit
I'm always mad with you, I never laugh with you
I used to gas you and tell you I missed you
But I never had you but I can imagine (Yeah)

[Chorus: PnB Rock & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion
And she in love with the fast whips
Can't wait to catch you in traffic

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, I done fell for a bad bitch
And she in love with the fashion, yeah
And she in love with the fast whips, yeah
Can't wait to catch you in traffic, yeah
