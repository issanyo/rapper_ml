[Hook]
Before I Go Another Day
I Got Something I Gotta Say
It Ain't Supposed To Be This Way
Because....
I Ain't Tryna Fall In Love
I Don't Wanna Fall In Love
Don't Make Me Try To Fall In Love
No I Don't Wanna Fall In Love
It Ain't Supposed To Be This Way
No I Don't Wanna Fall In Love
Don't Make Me Try To Fall In Love
Cause I Ain't Tryna Fall In Love
It Ain't Supposed To Be This Way

[Verse 1]
Where Do I Begin Right Now?
This Feel Like The End Right Now
But It's The Beginning Girl
Everything Is Different Girl
Can't Even Pretend Right Now
I Swear I Was I Could To Give You All Of Me
But All These Bitches They Keep Callin Me
Plus Shawty You Know You Made It Hard For Me
So For Now You Only Get A Part Of Me,Yeah
I Remember We Was Cool
You Would Come And Check A Nigga At The School
You Was Cool With Every Nigga In My Crew
Shit Crazy Even Fucked Another Nigga In My Crew
But That Don't Change How I Feel
I Fuck With You Cause You Real
You Told The Truth That Was Thrill
But Now I Don't Want No Bail, Hell Nah
I'm Just Tryna Live My Life
I Ain't Tryna Be Tied Down With No Wife
I'm Just Tryna Be Smokin Weed Throwin Ones On Stripper Bitches Fuckin Model Hoes All Night
So I Ain't Got Time For Relationships I'm Out Here Tryna Make A Flip
You Say You Love Me Shawty You Don't Love Me You Just Love This Dick

[Hook]
Before I Go Another Day
I Got Something I Gotta Say
It Ain't Supposed To Be This Way
Because....
I Ain't Tryna Fall In Love
I Don't Wanna Fall In Love
I Ain't Tryna Fall In Love
In Love, In Love, In Love,Love
Ain't Supposed To Be This Way
