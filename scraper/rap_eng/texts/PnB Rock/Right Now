[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

[Verse 1: PnB Chizz]
Yo work man, I’m so fuckin’ high
Feel like my body’s out my mind
How he your rider, he don’t ride
Fuck nigga me wrong without a [?]
With a brand-new watch, I ain’t even got time
Got a brand-new fire, I can’t even change your mind
You see all these haters on me
I done came through and took all they shine
While they was rappin’ I was trappin’, making trips
Reason why I wasn’t ever at they networking events
Every time we drop a track we gain some fans, I am convinced
Niggas feel it ‘cause it’s realer, nigga I think we’re the shit, we the shit
I’m the realest spitter here, fuck you niggas talkin’
I pull up in that Range like fuck you niggas walkin’
And I won’t ever stop until they put me in a coffin
Coppers coming then they chalk it
Where was I again? I lost it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

[Verse 2: PnB Shizz]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, all eyes on me
Hit ‘em up, 2Pac with a four-four
Block jumpin’ like a pogo
Drinkin’ liquor ‘til I’m faded, tell the bartender pour more
Rollin’ weed like tides, won’t give it a break
Cut the work ‘til it rise like I’m baking a cake
But I’m bakin’ an eighth
Cook it ‘til it oils, shit so good got the fiends scrapping the plate
Tryna grind a whole chicken from a half a biscuit
No Popeyes, work lookin’ like I’m missin’ a Bisquick
So fly, thirty thousand feet with an L lit
Louboutin, blood on feet, bitch got Chanel drip
Bankrolls on fold on me
Bad bitches on poles on me
Cîroc caseloads on me
Straight shots to the body, no vest on me
Benny bops, all hundreds, need the cream
Two bitches gettin’ nasty, one thing
No fee nigga, everything free
Promethazine got a nigga on lean

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
I got them waitin’ on my shit to drop like a fuckin’ celebrity
Niggas can’t fuck with me
That’s your girlfriend, she in love with me
And she love the way that I sing to her
I’ma take her home, do my thing to her
Always talkin’ ‘bout what you ain’t doin’
She said I beat it up, you don’t do a thing to her
Smoking on piff right now
Higher than a bitch right now
I can hit a lick right now
‘Cause I don’t give a shit right now
All my niggas do the same
All my niggas ‘bout money, we ain’t playin’ no games
All my niggas go hard
Straight to the top, where we goin’ we gon’ fuck up the game
All my niggas get money like me
Smoke, pop percs, and be stunting like me
Bitch we too young, we don’t need no wifey
I say fuck your crew ayy if y’all don’t like me

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
