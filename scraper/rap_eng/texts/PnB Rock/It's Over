[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Times change, I been in a different mind frame
I want you to know that you was my bae
In the past, now things changed
Gave you everything, yeah I gave you everything
Drop top, spinnin' coupe
Livin' life fuck a roof
Gucci on, Jimmy Choos
I did it all just for you
Fuckin' up all this paper
Girl we used to get faded
Used to have a nigga chasin'
Now a nigga elevated

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up
Slow up, slow up
Girl, I thought I told you
What we had is over
Hold up, hold up
Slow up, slow up
Girl, I thought I told you
Ooh, we had it so good

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you want to roll with me
You just want to come through and smoke with me
Fuck you from the back to some Jodeci
But I thought I told you
What we had is over

[Verse 2]
What we had is over
Girl, I thought I told you
Used to park up on the road, right on the side and smoke up
Talk about what we gon' do and then one day you fucked up
'Cause you fucked my brother
Girl, you got me fucked up
But I ain't trippin' girl, it's cool
I got all these different hoes
I got bitches in the coupe
I been doin' it on the road
I been litty at my shows
Yeah, I got it on my own
Yeah, I got it on my own
Yeah, I told you I would blow up and you thought it was a game
Yeah, I told you I would glow up and you treated me like a lame
'Til I pulled up in that new whip and then your face dropped
Huh, but girl I thought I told you
Yeah, you know it's over

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up
Slow up, slow up
Girl, I thought I told you
What we had is over
Hold up, hold up
Slow up, slow up
Girl, I thought I told you
Ooh, we had it so good

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you want to roll with me
You just want to come through and smoke with me
Fuck you from the back to some Jodeci
But I thought I told you
What we had is over
