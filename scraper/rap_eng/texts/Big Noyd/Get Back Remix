Yo... put a bullet in ya mind

[Prodigy]
Yo dun, They caught me from the blind side, me the P

And in the mean time, and in between time

More boxes of talons to put in your spine
You cross me nigga, you lost your mind
Scratch that, you never knew me from the start, so I forgive you
After you die squirmin, shots burning (fizzling)

[Noyd]
Ayo when the guns pop, the thugs pop em, everybody kno

[Havoc]
Basicly, they done summed it up and ain't no reason to spit
But fuck it, lemme have my lil 2 cent
The nine'll leave you so bent
Have you huggin the ground like a toilet bowl ready to hurl
You'll be havin outta body visions
And if you lucky to live, no doubt, you'll be find a religion
Gittin shot up can do that, most'll squeal
They so shook, the sound of fire crackers makin 'em peel
Niggas rhyme how they kill (kill)
Rhyme how they feel (feel)
Talkin all that like they ??? for the deal
But me, if I ain't have to... prolly wouldn't clap you
But they see you wit that paper and wanna git at you
I dont preach about the shit, I just show 'em what mack do
You kno these slugs harder than any track you rap to
When cowards talk shit, it just make the finger itch
I got drama for that ass, wanna meet the bitch?
