[Intro]
Kadamawe, kadamawe
Selassie I
Jah nastalin
Yo back wi city ah chalwah, Addis Ababa
Yo, armageddeon!

[Chorus Sizzla]
I was born in a system that doesn't give a fuck about you
Nor me nor the life… of our kids
Keep my guns load you never know, just in case things get frig
That's just the way I live, yeah!
That's me, yeah, as is

[Prodigy]
Yo
P, I'm a young boss mob nigga 'tIl I cross
Over to the next side, man, call it what you want
Heaven or hell, my niggas still in rebel
And find a ways that we can take it to the next level
Tell God stop fearin' himself
Slow down and pay attention to the kids in the ghetto
Down here it's big business, if you ain't got wealth
You ain't got shit, all y'all 'bout to bear witness
To the infinite, infamous team
Can't put a time frame on us, we infinitely
Makin' Dynasty look like a cancelled show
Make your whole life story look like a real hoax
Niggas got they mind on our money, they watchin' us grow
But they can't eat off our tree, it's poisoned yo
Get your hands outta my pockets, you already know
I'm countin' money e'ry time you try to reach me on the phone

[Chorus Sizzla]
I was born in a system that doesn't give a fuck about you
Nor me nor the life… of our kids
Keep my guns load you never know, just in case things get frig
That's just the way I live, yeah!
That's me, yeah, as is

[Havoc]
Ugh
My destiny's a billion bucks
Such and such was lookin' for you (dees nuts)
And that's what you get when you think that you tricky
You got it twisted baby, get up out my bidness
Please don't get me pissed
And with those lames you be frontin' them games on
Listen at some real talk before you spread the news
Act serious, analyze rap livin' got break down your spirit
Like the dog taught not to go nowhere near it
Palms itch like an afro switch, we get the money eyes twitch
Cowards talk about me already now
You done talked me up, so there I is
In the Bent coup, Range Rove seven, a Benz
With the haze blowin' heavenly, know what it is
We gon have police pull us, they know what it is
Mad guns wit us, but you little things well hid
It be the bust of the century, they raid the crib

[Chorus Sizzla]
I was born in a system that doesn't give a fuck about you
Nor me nor the life… of our kids
Keep my guns load you never know, just in case things get frig
That's just the way I live, yeah!
That's me, yeah, as is

[Big Noyd]
Ay yo
Dat's my word, nigga we don't play around here
Fuck what ya heard, niggas would assume we right there
No reason to be scared, my gun right here
And assume my goons is somewhere near
I'm hoodie, I admit it, but dig it
I'm real, and my diamonds be blindin' them hos when they stare
So I scoop one, put in the coup then I bail
You know they be lovin' the Benz symbol on the rear
I stash Glocks up in my stash box for real
Let them cops guard the streets, I lie like chills
And it's hot with the legendary bars around the hill
Niggas be grinding, be pitchin' the dime, they know the deal
And some walk around with buck fifty's on the grill
They little niggas eat they food like a happy meal
That's the hood, the money good, but the streets is ill
It's deep, you can't even sleep a wink, order pills

[Chorus Sizzla]
I was born in a system that doesn't give a fuck about you
Nor me nor the life… of our kids
Keep my guns load you never know, just in case things get frig
That's just the way I live, yeah!
That's me, yeah, as is
