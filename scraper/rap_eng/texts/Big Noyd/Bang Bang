Alchemist this is it kid

[Noyd Verse 1]
Yo, they can't fuck with that boy Noyd I'm ill I'm too real
They don't know what beef is, these niggas better chill
See I'm cool - unless I have to merk something
Then that's when I [Voice Talking] shoot em'up And murder the man
I shed they eye lids from violence nigga you see you wilden
Your team against my team there ain't no challenge
Niggas know we mobben
Rolling in thousands man we will [Voice Talking] shoot em'up
And leave they ass silent
The word you the herb niggas clowning
Polishing they knuckle game bashing your mouth in
Thought you was thugging but now nigga you front-IN
Screaming you a don all along this nigga not a thing
It's on now
See his ass in the street
Out come the guns know the thuns man we gotta eat
QB nigga and we don't give a fuck who want beef
We don't care about your cars, Nigga see we got heat
We don't care about your broads, Nigga see we love the street
Front get your ass lumped nigga it be our treat
Ga Head we don't front in dem streets when it comes to that beef
You know we [Voice Talking] shoot em'up and leave em dead on the concrete
Need more heat for more beef, more thuns we more deep
More guns on more streets, the beef on it's no sleep
There's more heat for police, Check the guns we squeezing

Niggas screaming they hood but out side of they hood they nothing
Niggas never [Voice Talking] bang bang
Niggas screaming they hood, I run up in they hood and *Gun loaded and fired*

[Noyd Verse 2]
Ayo niggas don't want it
If they want it then they get it
See I talk because I live it and walk with a mean limp
Know what I mean keep a thing on my hip
Gotta mean kick
And I don't be without it
Look I'm the next best gat slinging rap singing
Nigga outta Queensbridge, and I don't be playing with dem meters
I'm more into drama bringing, have you in dirt
Your mama in church with her choir singing
Step out your zone you get blown open leave it
Nigga I'm terror like a squad full of Puerto Ricans
Insomniac with drama nigga there's no sleeping
I got nickel plated revolvers for that reason
See I been puffing blunts and I'm high
Know that I'm on point boy punch I'll you in your eye
Cause every time they tell me put my gun away
I tell them yeah right
Boy I'll [Voice Talking] shoot em'up cause I ain't tryna fight
And I ain't dying tonight I'm trying to scoop me some boots
And wear them out until they worn out
That's right
And anything else is just uncivilized, I [Voice Talking] shoot em'up
Trying to cop out with the cutie pies

[Chorus 2]
Niggas screaming they hood but out side of they hood they nothing
Niggas never [Voice Talking] bang bang
Nah, niggas screaming they hood
I run up in they hood and [Voice Talking] shoot em'up
And this is how we do it man
Niggas screaming they hood but out side of they hood they nothing
Niggas never [Voice Talking] bang bang
Niggas screaming they hood, I run up in they hood and *Gun loaded and fired*
[Voice Talking] Bang
