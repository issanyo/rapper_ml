[ VERSE 1 ]
See, I'm about money, a whole lotta cheese
Niggas talkin greasy - it ain't about me
Cause bullets cost money, but I give 'em out for free
If I hear my name out the mouth of a MC
Nigga please, niggas must be smokin good trees
Always poppin shit, you know how the hood be
They envy when you walk, they rather see you down
When you go broke, them niggas ain't around
Clowns, see 'em in the street, air 'em out
I'm deaf, I ain't tryina hear nobody now
Gotta tell my money shut up, it talks too much
They say my records won't sell, I'm New York too much
I keep a hammer on the hip, Henny in the cup
Money over bitches, now that's what's up
But don't get me wrong, you know I keep a ho
But ain't nothin that a nigga love more than the dough
I'm 'bout money

[ VERSE 2 ]
See, it don't mean a thing if it ain't about green
Like when you mention the Bridge you think about Queens
I go all out for the cake, you know I love the CREAM
You hear the word Infamous, you think of my team
Ron Gotti, Hav and P, G.O.D
Gambino, Ty Nitty and the N-o-y-d
Money-hungry go-getters, fly hood niggas
From the ice in the rings to the 40-inch gleam
Too much dough for money clips, partners in this rap shit
All we do is stack chips and load the Mac clips
You know the money talks, so listen ma and disappear
I'm goin Hollyhood, I'm tryina be a millionaire
Who cares if we break up, we ain't gotta make up
All I do is cake up from the time I wake up
No time to slip up, just make sure my money long
You know you hoes disappear when the money gone
