[ VERSE 1 ]
It's your boy Rapper Noyd, clappin toys, leave you famous
Kill the noise, Zoid, you will get destroyed by the stainless
Leave you brainless cause we gangsters that'll bang you out of anger
These slugs'll rearrange ya cause you nothin but a wankster
While you poppin shit we poppin clips, pop a cop, I pop your bitch
I'm that rude, that dude you don't wanna be fuckin with
I warn you once, that's all you get, I'm wild and I'm ruthless
I should lynch your ass, some hang-you-from-the-roof shit
Like Q did to Bishop, yeah I'm on some Juice shit
All for respect, you know how the goons get
Son, we ain't new to this, we true to this gangster shit
Navy blue Carhartt, Infamous handkerchief
Every day is dangerous, niggas wanna get at me
But I'm from the hood and the hip is where the gat be
You ain't gotta ask me, I'm right here, who want it?
That Queensbridge bullshit, yup yup, we on it

[ Hook ]
Cause we hungry, heartless, loco, retarted
Crazy, maybe, real quick to start shit
Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn to Harlem
We all got guns, you know we be mobbin
Boosters, shooters, niggas that be robbin
Kidnap your babies, you don't want no problems
Fuck you, pay me, my niggas is starvin
Infamous in this bitch, you know we be Mobbin

[ VERSE 2 ]
You know why?
Cause I don't go nowhere without it, be without it cause I'm 'bout it
Make it rain on you cowards, bring a storm of gun showers
Make it smell like gun powder cause haters I devour
Face it, the game's ours, we ain't playin with them doubters
Aimin gats, swingin bats, fuck your raps, shit is crap
Dressed in black ( ? ) I put one up in your back
Stay in your lane cause if it's fame you want stuntin you can get it
I send shots through your fitted, you want it, come with it
Cause I'm here all year, no fear, cock the bizkit
It might not pop off, but you don't wanna risk it
Bring the bidness with the burners or the ratchet or the hammer
I'm bananas, you only act gangster in front of cameras
You ain't gully, I get money cause I'm live, ride or die
In QB where I reside, puffin lye gettin high
See we fly while you drive, we up while you strive
You lease while we buy, cause I'm the truth, you'se a lie
Muthafucka
