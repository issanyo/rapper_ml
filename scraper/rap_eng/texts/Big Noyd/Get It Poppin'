Nighttime shift, you know it gets no realer than this
What? We be comin', we comin', 41st side nigga, gangstaz
Come on, we be in your face, bitch

You know when Q U come through, we get 'em for they chain
They ain't sayin', quick to blow your motha'fuckin' brains
Nigga light the Benz on autor, word to the daughter
Feel me black, ya' niggas wanna beef, ya' niggas betta squeeze

Hope he left his memories and fact, assumin' that I love
That the streets and my gats, who hold me down?
Who got my back? No one, who holdin' me down?
Who got my back? Shit my big guns makin' you cowards run

I hit the bitch all in the lungs, son, wack 'em
When I flashed on 'em, I had his man turn an ass on 'em
'Cuz the dezzy was pointed on his headdy
This niggas ain't ready, dunn I dead crew
And ain't got shit poppin' on Channel One news

Who the fuck is these dudes? Niggas wanna fuck
Who the fuck wanna screw? I'm reach for my shit ready to blast one
Doin' jukes wit' the one they say the mask on
Yo hold me down your heart is low budget son
You had one in the head but you didn't pull it son

No time for fake-ness
Be the first and last mistake you eva fuckin' make, bitch
Come out and stop hidin', deal wit' the pressure
Before I send hunger and gun to come get ya
Wit 4-4's and betta, dumb-dumb's, I bet ya
You won't even feel wit' when they kill ya
So watch your back, bitch

'Cuz we ghetto gangsta shit, 41st side nigga
Come on, 'cuz we comin', we comin', we comin'
41st side what we here now
Let's show 'em how we get down

All I see is crime outside and truthfully, I can't take it
All these pains inside, don't think I'mma make it
Shit, the game is real so you must stay strong
All I see is cats locked up and dead and gone

I know cats that hate to take flicks
Blood thick in the hip by lingua chicks
Eager to strip, cornball slip, they knees stash closer to my dick
Savage dude eatin' food, disturbin' the eagle trips

Son kissed to my lips bein' bees played the concrete
Snow in the summer to increase your heart-beat
Duke, make it happen so retrovior right?
But when I black out and cut y'all in half and sayin' it ain't right?

Six building of the hook, Henny and Remy's
Stand dawg lays in samy at your enemy
Now they pass memories, I pal chicken till the death
Legal raw or legal I'm covered so fuck the ATF

Now fact the lord, my thoughts are raw
I'm capable to leave the sickness seemed to chair-fold
Now the fair war or severe any man hoar head
Shots chest, shots squeeze till this red hot

Bubble like where hustle and numb rocks
Soften your hard rocks wit' one shot
And put your mind on your opposer
Blood ooze on his rose-rary as I back away cautiously

All I see is crime outside and truthfully, I can't take it
All these pains inside, don't think I'mma make it
Shit, the game is real so you must stay strong
All I see is cats locked up and dead and gone

All I see is crime outside and truthfully, I can't take it
All these pains inside, don't think I'mma make it
Shit, the game is real so you must stay strong
All I see is cats locked up and dead and gone

All I see is crime outside and truthfully, I can't take it
All these pains inside, don't think I'mma make it
Shit, the game is real so you must stay strong
All I see is cats locked up and dead and gone
