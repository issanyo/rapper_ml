[Hook]
At the end of the road turn right
After 80 meters turn right
Then take the second left
Go right on the roundabout first exit
Turn around when possible

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo listen, they wanna set me up, uh huh, grab me up
They can’t take it how i make it, stay being bucked
Truth be told, they beneath me, let’s be honest
Cause I be switching up the scenery like from the projects
To the Kremlin, the Hong Kong skyline
He’ll never get a turn, it’s always my time
Find another skill, hip hop is mine
The only reason you rap is cause you heard my rhymes
You wasting good drug money on studio time
You better off buying clothes, get fresh, right
You suck, turn that bullshit off
You ain’t got no Mobb Deep in your iPod
You ain’t got no Don P, your whole life wrong
This the best of the best, turn the lights on
You need to see what the fuck is going on
I’m the main event,  the great wizard of bars

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I’ve been riding down that road for a minute
Speeding in and out of lanes pushing it to the limit
But the journey’s not finished
Part away from P to handle my own business
I met a fork in the road
Which way to go? I’m all for the dough
It’s money over hoes, bullet for the skull
Fucked up when you gotta put your dreams on hold
And your homies don’t see the bigger picture like you do
Trying to navigate to a city that I outgrew
Fuck the world ‘cause they doubt you
Hear your enemies, but watch them niggas that’s around you
100 MPH, getting closer to the exit
Heard you took it off cause I’m on to some next shit
Am I headed in the right direction?
Only God knows, but I count my blessings

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Noyd]
I got the pedal to the metal doing about a 100
Jake in the rearview, sirens going
Red and blues flashing, life is on high speed
Only thing that slow me down this blunt and some good trees
But it’s hotter than a pancake
That’s life’s struggle, it is what you make it
But me I’m about the paper like a ticket
It’s all about the dough, fuck the speed limit
Stacking change, stay in your lane
Don’t rub a neck, keep your eyes on your own thing
Check your blind spot before you make moves
Whether left or right, nigga, watch what you do
Cause a wreck could happen in a sec
Pushing it too hard, you end up in treeyards
See me, I stay strapped like a safe-belt
He tucked under the seat, that’s how we roll

[Hook]

[Outro]
After 100 meters, make a U-turn
Then at the end of the road, Turn right
After 200 meters - sharp left
Then, you have reached your destination
You have reached your destination
