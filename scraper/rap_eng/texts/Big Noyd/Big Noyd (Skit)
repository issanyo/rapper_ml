[Big Noyd (Havoc)]
Verbal kill, verbal kill, let me drop it like this (verbal kill)

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting lit up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
And it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and I need to be blessed
With a firepack, and don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You didn't phase me, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy
