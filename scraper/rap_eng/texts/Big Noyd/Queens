Yeah-Yeah, Yeah, grab the pump pump
(yeah) It's on we 'bout ta thump thump...
...aiyo aiyo my left eye jump, I feel bad luck upon me
Make me grab my pump and call my Brook-Lyn army
We by Q.B. and N.C. - niggas dont want it
Debate ta the G's and the west all on it
We all flaunt it, guns and chicks
And, all my dunns rhyme hold'ng they dicks
Wit' a .9 on they side from hip ta hip
You know the +Mobb Niggas+ is sick and stay bent
Twisted, get right, me and my guns is tight
And we both heated when the funds ain't right
Because we know someone gett'ng stuck tonight
Before I crash I'ma fucks me some ass tonight
Wit' a pocket full of dough and bottle of that 'dro
Wit' dreams of fuck'ng some R&B hoe
They call me N.o.y.d. baby, from Q.B
Baby don't hate me, We live, I rep...

Com'n from Queens, wear'ng diamond rings
Call me a highness, Ima king niggas rap about gats I blaze
.4 pound in a .12 gauge, no I never knock the hustle
Dunn crime pay, keep it gangsta on this side
You know I put 2 in your stomach
Ya niggas front'ng, y'all dont really want it
You know who I be, Noyd from Q.B
G' you upset, cuz I spit profinity-dity
I kick that real shit, fuck-a-bitch, get rich
You say Im noth'ng, Im lift
And you gangsta - Bullshit!
Get ya .2's ready ta flip, ya fools better hit
Got my shit fully gripped aim it, at ya shit
Why you think'ng I'ma miss, keep think'ng
You get twist, I runn'ng wit the Grimiest
Shit +The Infamous+, while you bang'ng our hits
We bang'ng your bitch, and you down ta turn around
And blow you down wit' the 5th
