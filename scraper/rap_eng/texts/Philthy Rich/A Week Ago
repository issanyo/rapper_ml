[Intro: Prezi]
It's Prezi

[Verse 1: Prezi]
My heart got cold, a couple niggas switched over
You can't trip on a bitch about some shit you shouldn't've told her
I'm a self-made nigga, I don't follow the next
Why you niggas chasin' bags that you can't even catch?
Let's keep it solid P, nerds, you niggas gotta be
I stand firm and got a grip, you niggas out of reach
It's only right I make sure my niggas got a piece
Chains on my neck like it's water and I don't got a sink
That's facts nigga
Good nigga but they act like I'm the bad guy
My nigga did some sucker shit, I never asked why
When the bitch fagged off, I never asked why
Touched my first fifty thousand, damn near cried

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Okay, shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on
Okay, shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
It's Philthy nigga, uh-huh, look
On my kid's heartbeat, I checked twenty-five today (Swear to God)
Out a faggot ass bitch that I should've fired today (Faggot)
I remember that it jammed the first time I fired the K (Oh I remember)
Bounced out broad day, them suckers got away (It's Philthy nigga)
Still trippin' on them niggas about Fetty, you can believe that
High as fuck off this Hi-Tech 'cause I done relapsed (Syrup)
Slide through the opps' wake and shoot up they repass (Slide)
I was locked up when I got the word that T passed (It's Philthy)
'Cause if it ain't direct, it ain't respected (Uh-uh)
Internet thugs only send subliminal messages (Suckers)
Man these niggas fake like the diamonds in they necklace (That fufu)
Man these niggas neck turn to green, it's infected (Is that right?)
It's Philthy ho

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Okay, shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on
Okay, shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on

[Verse 3: Dolla Dame]
Look I made it to the top and brought my niggas with me
You know I got Semi with me, you know I got Philthy in it
All these blue hundreds, they won't fit in my Amiri denims
Heard that nigga ratted on the gang then you won't catch me near him, uh
If it's fuck me then it's fuck you, you know how I'm rockin'
Last nigga played with me almost got a coffin
Hole in your head like a dolphin
Shut your mouth when bosses talkin'
I just popped another percocet, it got me feelin' naseous
Lately I been movin' cautious
These niggas might try to off me
I just spent a grip on these Margielas
Please watch where you walkin'
And have Lil Miko shoot you in your mouth for all that extra talkin'
All this water drippin' off my neck, look like a runnin' faucet

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Okay shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on
Okay shit was all good just a week ago
You say ballin' nigga, we don't ever see you though
If it's a problem then we shootin', what we speakin' for?
I self-made it to the top and put my people on
