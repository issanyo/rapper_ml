[Verse 1]
Rest in peace Blade, free Big Meech (free Big Meech)
I just left Canes for a three piece (I did)
Back to back games, that's a three-peat (is that right?)
Them broke niggas think we got a cheat sheet (pussy)
Million dollar nigga, remember I was broke (oh I remember)
How can I forget, was sleepin' on the floor (swear to God)
No money for the rent, eviction on the door (uh-uh)
No heat in the house, my heart turned cold (it's Philthy)
These diamonds on my neck got my chest cold (bustdown)
Sippin' Actavis for a chest cold (syrup)
You bum ass niggas don't fit the dress code (broke nigga)
FOD bitch, the new Death Row (it's Philthy)
Shout out my nigga Mone and Maine nigga (salute)
Shout out my nigga Din and Dame nigga (salute)
Now we don't fuck with him, he a lame nigga (he a lame nigga)
FOD bitch, and you ain't gang nigga (it's Philthy)
As you can see I'm still with the same niggas (Seminary)
Got my money up and I ain't changed nigga (solid)
Spent two hundred thousand on the chain nigga (what else?)
And spent another twenty on the ring nigga (it's Philthy)
Low got that kilo-zone around his neck (ayy Low what's happenin'?)
Plus a shoulder strap to hold a KelTec (keep it on my name)
I'll die for my name, I'll die for my city (I will)
I'll die for my chain, I'll die for my respect, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Bitch come play for the winning team (for the winning team)

[Verse 2]
MVP, put fifty up (it's Philthy ho)
I had a good week and put fifty up (fifty thousand)
My nigga in the feds got fifty months (ayy free my nigga)
The pointers in the Rollie, they fifties huh? (they is)
Big ass house out in Las Vegas (five marry)
Rent hella high, this shit outrageous (chump change)
Broke niggas livin' off lost wages (broke nigga)
I ain't got a deal but livin' like a major (it's Philthy)
I was good at selling dope, I wasn't good at sports (thirty-six)
Introduced to the game and jumped off the porch (Seminary)
Honda Accord money, couldn't afford a Porsche (uh-uh)
Now I got a Porsche I don't drive no more (it's Philthy)
All of the sudden all these niggas talkin' bust down (bust down)
I was the first nigga talkin' bust down (bust down)
Them lil diamonds in your bezel, that ain't bust down (bust down)
If it ain't all the way around it ain't a bust down (bust down)
Hundred pair of red bottoms sittin' in the closet (designer)
Got a hundred rounds sittin' in the cartridge (a hundred of 'em)
Diamonds lookin' like they sittin' in the faucet (water)
Foreign off the lot, his came from an auction (foreign)
How you from Seminary but you ain't FOD? (huh?)
How you from Seminary but you don't know? (huh?)
Better sit on the curb and stay out the streets (better nigga)
And you better think twice 'fore crossing me, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Bitch come play for the winning team (for the winning team)
Bitch come play for the winning team (for the winning team)
Bitch come play for the winning team (winning team)
FOD, bitch the winning team (it's Philthy)
Bitch come play for the winning team (ayy do that)
Bitch come play for the winning team (for the winning team)
Bitch come play for the winning team (for the winning team)
FOD, bitch the winning team (it's Philthy)
