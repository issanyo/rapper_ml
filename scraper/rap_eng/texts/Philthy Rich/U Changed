[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
This is for the days you were never there
Told you 'bout my pain but you never cared
Now I pull up in a Range and that Panamera
And you act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
Niggas thought I went broke so they skated on me
Found out I was rich and act like they never hated on me
Oh what you don't remember? your memory bad?
When I was banned from the radio you wasn't fuckin' with FAB
All them fake hugs and that fake dap
Shit changed quick like ASAP
All that fake love make you hate cats
Niggas fake as fuck and they J-cats
Niggas gave up on me like I wasn't gon' make my way back
Now I'm ballin' on these broke niggas, bitch this shit the payback
Remember me from way back? with the wave cap and the A's hat?
When Rob Ben repped ASAP and Top Ramen we ate that?
Now there's Maseratis and mansions, Mercedes, Maybachs
Whole team eatin', these niggas like where my plate at?
That same place where you stayed at
On the side of the fence where that gate at
Don't switch sides, nigga stay down
'Cause a nigga really havin' cake here
Nigga didn't believe in me, but now he see me shining
Dope ass dynasty, nigga we goin' diamond

[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
This is for the days you were never there
Told you 'bout my pain but you never cared
Now I pull up in a Range and that Panamera
And you act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, please do me a favor, don't do me no favors
He confessed to the gang, don't need to see the papers
Couple niggas I know already seen the statements
We was told as a kid to never let 'em break us
Loyal nigga in your corner but you went against me
We was both broke together, we couldn't make ends meet
In his feelings on IG so he went and dissed me
He remind me of my ex bitch who really miss me
If it's fuck them niggas then it's fuck them niggas now
And they dead homies too, them niggas in the ground
In that block that you claim I dropped a hundred rounds
But you was never outside, you didn't come around
House nigga, I'm in the field with it, pull up on me
Takin' credit for that shooting but you ain't pull up on me
Looked that nigga in the eye before he pulled it on me
I bet he wish that I was dead because his money on me, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
This is for the days you were never there
Told you 'bout my pain but you never cared
Now I pull up in a Range and that Panamera
And you act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah

[Verse 3: Dolla Dame]
Yeah, you used to be the brodie, you was gang nigga
You politicking with them suckers, you can't hang nigga
Through ups and downs I stood on ten, I'm still the same nigga
Opps watching, niggas still drilling, you ain't bang nigga
'Cause niggas actin' like they solid, I can't fuck with that
Finessed him with that KK, now he stuck with that
If you ever try to play me I'm gon' up the strap
A hundred shots, came with one shooter, ain't no comin' back
You switched up and jumped ship, it ain't no comin' back
Once niggas crossed me niggas lost me, I can't fuck with that
Watch who you feed 'cause they'll still stab you in the back
Most niggas changed so I'm still ridin' with that MAC
Bitch I fell back and I'm still hot
Draco in the water and it still shot, still pop
Niggas changed up so y'all still opps
Big Glock forty, all black, look like Chris Rock

[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
This is for the days you were never there
Told you 'bout my pain but you never cared
Now I pull up in a Range and that Panamera
And you act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
Act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
You act like you ain't changed on a nigga, yeah
