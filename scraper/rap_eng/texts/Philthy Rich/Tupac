[Chorus: Babyface Ray]
I got check on top of check, drank is always poured
Hoes on top of hoes, had a threesome with some hoes I ain't know
You would think these niggas quit weed 'cause they don't want no smoke
God can strike me down right now if I ain't off a four
I just toss it in the air and watch 'em scoop it off the floor
I just jump down on the pedal, watch the coupe jump off the floor
I just touch down in Miami, let my roof back on a ho
Louis bandana on, I feel like 2Pac on a ho

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Thick bitch from Detroit with a fat ass named Celly P
Yeah that's your bitch but when I'm in town the ho fuckin' me
Rollie on, I fall asleep, these designer jeans cost a couple G's
I don't know how to say the name right but the tag on 'em say Japanese
What I pour in a twenty-ounce you probably pour in a one liter
Your baby mama she a cum eater, don't give a fuck if her son see it
Free Pence and free Vez, middle finger when I see feds
My niggas ride, don't need pads, got a bad bitch on the t-rex
Lil nigga you ain't gettin' money, you just started gettin' shit this year
In a foreign made this year, you been pillow talkin' in a bitch ear
Free my niggas on the fifth tier, in the Aston Martin in sixth gear
Couple P's gettin' sent there, just sign for it, let it sit there

[Chorus: Babyface Ray]
I got check on top of check, drank is always poured
Hoes on top of hoes, had a threesome with some hoes I ain't know
You would think these niggas quit weed 'cause they don't want no smoke
God can strike me down right now if I ain't off a four
I just toss it in the air and watch 'em scoop it off the floor
I just jump down on the pedal, watch the coupe jump off the floor
I just touch down in Miami, let my roof back on a ho
Louis bandana on, I feel like 2Pac on a ho

[Verse 2: Team Eastside Peezy]
Diamonds on me, I'm lit, bitches all on my dick
Ridin' 'round in that Hellcat, you can't see a nigga through the tint
I got big bands in my pocket, I'ma pull it out when I take a pic
Jumpin' out with my chain swanging, nigga I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real killers on the payroll, nigga play with me and get your face blown
Rollie on got the face blown, drinkin' Ace of Spade by the caseload
Designer on me, got the hat and shoes, made one call and get the bag to move
Damn right I feel like I'm the shit, muggin' niggas like I got an attitude
She won't even pay you no attention, I'ma fuck the ho for a stack or two
Jumpin' out the new drop Bentley, new hundreds on me got me actin' rude
Hit my line when you tryna work, I got the hook-up, I ain't black and blue
Had to be a dog where I'm from, niggas wouldn't survive on my avenue

[Chorus: Babyface Ray]
I got check on top of check, drank is always poured
Hoes on top of hoes, had a threesome with some hoes I ain't know
You would think these niggas quit weed 'cause they don't want no smoke
God can strike me down right now if I ain't off a four
I just toss it in the air and watch 'em scoop it off the floor
I just jump down on the pedal, watch the coupe jump off the floor
I just touch down in Miami, let my roof back on a ho
Louis bandana on, I feel like 2Pac on a ho

[Verse 3: Babyface Ray]
Thug life, thug life, thug life
Motherfuck a job, mama know I live a drug life
Say you want it, I can get it to you, I'm the plug type
Diamonds hitting, got her mesmerized, took me one night
Drank poured, keep a bankroll
No time for these stank hoes
I'm high as hell, eyes can't close
At my show with baby dracos
I'll paint a nigga like Maaco
Two lines of drop in my Faygo
Ain't too many places I can't go
In the streets ballin' like AO
Give me the guala, cash, pesos
Hoes do what I say so
Killers do what I pay for
You don't make the list, you should pray for
God bless, got big chunks of diamond sittin' on my chest
My homeboy said it's A-1, took my rap money then I invest

[Chorus: Babyface Ray]
I got check on top of check, drank is always poured
Hoes on top of hoes, had a threesome with some hoes I ain't know
You would think these niggas quit weed 'cause they don't want no smoke
God can strike me down right now if I ain't off a four
I just toss it in the air and watch 'em scoop it off the floor
I just jump down on the pedal, watch the coupe jump off the floor
I just touch down in Miami, let my roof back on a ho
Louis bandana on, I feel like 2Pac on a ho

[Verse 4: BandGang Paid Will]
Pack just touched down, I gotta scoop it on the low
I don't need no watch and so I move it on the low
Bust the ones out the wrapper then throw it on the floor
I give a bitch a hard time, make her work for what she want
I can't tell you what I know, cookie only thing I smoke
Wasn't nobody in my corner back then when I was broke
Had to keep my distant from 'em, niggas workin' on the low
Ridin' in that foreign thing, raise the curtains on a ho
Me and Philthy leanin' hard, we just dropped another four
These lame ass niggas tryna copy but they broke
Just place your order nigga, I'll get it to your door
We ain't had shit given, had to work for what we want, bitch

[Chorus: Babyface Ray]
I got check on top of check, drank is always poured
Hoes on top of hoes, had a threesome with some hoes I ain't know
You would think these niggas quit weed 'cause they don't want no smoke
God can strike me down right now if I ain't off a four
I just toss it in the air and watch 'em scoop it off the floor
I just jump down on the pedal, watch the coupe jump off the floor
I just touch down in Miami, let my roof back on a ho
Louis bandana on, I feel like 2Pac on a ho
