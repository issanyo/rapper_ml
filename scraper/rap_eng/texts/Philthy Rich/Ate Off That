[Chorus: Blaxk Je$u$]
Way before I touched the mic, I was straight off crack (I was straight off crack)
I ain't talkin' Hitler, but we ate off that (but we ate off that)
Baggin' her'on wit' a 'K in the trap (wit' a 'K in the trap)
Shit, I ain't talkin' Hitler but we ate off that (but we ate off that)
I sent the box in the mail, we should be straight off that (we should be straight off that)
It's Philthy nigga
I ain't talkin' Hitler, but we ate off that, uh uh (but we ate off that)
Bitches sellin' puss' all day on the track, bitch (all day on the track)
Shit, I ain't talkin' Hitler but we ate off that (but we ate off that)

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, I8 parked in Blow garage for a whole month (foreign's)
Ain't have no room in my garage shit, I ain't gon' front (uh uh)
Updated my new bitch, I never dated the bitch (I had to)
Might take her to Ruth's Chris, but no relations and shit (bitch)
She just made 100 thousand, one night, one trick (I swear to God)
So I took her to Highline and then flooded her wrist (bust down)
Man it's only right the bitch stunt like me (it's only right)
Matchin' bust down Rolly's, female version of me (it's Philthy)
Ain't a rapper in the game got more than me without a deal (broke niggas)
Naw, I ain't want it if it ain't comin' wit' a steal (yes sir)
My niggas in the jets they be stuck up in the field (aye free MA)
Free JBay he comin' home on the appeal (aye free JBay nigga)
Yeah, I still fuck wit' blow, just need a pot and a stove (36)
Yeah, I still fuck wit' blow, that's my brother fa sho (one mob)
Now days me and bro be sharin' these hoes (is that right?)
'Cause I remember growin' up, we was sharin' our clothes (oh I remember)

[Chorus: Blaxk Je$u$]

I sent the box in the mail, we should be straight off that (we should be straight off that)
I ain't talkin' Hitler, but we ate off that (but we ate off that)
Bitches sellin' puss' all day on the track (all day on the track)
Blow, check a real nigga out
Shit, I ain't talkin' Hitler but we ate off that (but we ate off that)

[Verse 2: Joe Blow]
Aye, I was a young nigga coppin' cream
Now OG's I used to cop from come and cop from me
Bitch hit me on IG sayin' she got the fee
Well talk is cheap, bitch send it or don't talk to me
This bust down kilo didn't cost a key
Plus I bust down my Rolly, bracelet, watch and rings
Used to bust down spreads just to feed the team
Cuddy do H, he couldn't keep up wit' the cost of lean
Now I don't leave the house without a gun on me
Call my Glock 22, droopy, it's a young .40
This 5-7 'bout as light as a feather
We gon' hit a lick and split it 'cause we got it together
About lil' A and Ray, I’m bouncin' out on whoever
My new ho, new goal's, to go buy me a dweller
Man I'm flyin' in the work but sometimes I'll mail it
Ever caught, I'll never talk, it ain't no way I’m tellin'

[Chorus: Blaxk Je$u$]

[Verse 3: YID]
I-Phone 6, watch me make a play off that (play off that)
Put money on Gliv's books, he gon' be straight off that (straight off that)
Aye, whatever you need, yeah, just meet me in the alleyway
A nigga fuck wit' me and my nigga's they gon' retaliate
Hundred round drums gon' make them niggas evacuate
Into kickin' doors but know some niggas who trappin' weight
And bitches know they gotta pay for my time
You wanna shoot it out nigga? I got a 'K for ya .9
They know we 'bout it in Oakland, so they don't never book me
Ain't sayin' I'm a killa, but niggas bet' not push me
Got bitches punchin' in cards and bitches sellin' pussy
Ain't never told them white folks shit every time they booked me
