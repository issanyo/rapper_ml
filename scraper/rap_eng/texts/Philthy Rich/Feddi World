[Intro]
Ay it's Philthy y'all
Rest in Peace my nigga Dre Feddi
Seminary that's Feddi World

[Chorus]
Seminary & Foothill, bitch that's Feddi World
C2nd and Harrison, bitch that's Feddi World
Seminary and Bromley, bitch that's Feddi World
Tapwaller way to the block, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, rest in peace Dre Feddi, girl

[Verse 1]
Rest in peace my nigga done
Behind him we sqeezin' triggers though
Line him up for a bricker coat
Leave a nigga in the thick of foe
Bitch they took my right hand
Chop on my nightstand
Pussy nigga just a hype man
Keeper really my biggest fan
Seminary this cemetery
Three of my niggas in preliminary
Niggas sweet like Ben & Jerry
To the streets I've been married
When Dre died my heart died
Wish he was here singing chorus side
I just pulled up four lines, tryna forget my hard times
Niggas don't feel my pain
Stressed out in my grains
Lost so many to the game
Blow washed away in the rain
Rest in peace to Ace Mouth, Lil' Pool and Fat Shorts
Rest in peace to Jody Boy, Skrilla Mike and Dre Feddi yo

[Chorus]
Seminary & Foothill, bitch that's Feddi World
C-2nd and Harrison, bitch that's Feddi World
Seminary and Bromley, bitch that's Feddi World
Tapwaller way to the block, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, rest in peace Dre Feddi, girl

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace my nigga Dre Feddi
Do to sleep with my K ready
Niggas know that my aim steady
Leave a pussy nigga's brain spaghetti
We ain't givin' out no passes
We just givin' out toe-tagging
Passin' out with no masses
Murder scene looking so drastic
Tell 'em niggas hit the scoreboards
Just knocked out like four more
Only got like to hit a red left
Prolly pull up four more
Seminary & Foothill
All the way to E-16
Those fiends pull up on a 10 speed
Had a nine-pack when I was sixteen
Rest in peace Dre King K
Downtown Oakla in Kinkaid's
Getting money like ten ways
In the hood we like TimTams
Rest in peace my nigga Weez
Rest in peace to Subkey
Rest in peace to C-Donny
Broke nigga's CDs down

[Chorus]
Seminary & Foothill, bitch that's Feddi World
C2nd and Harrison, bitch that's Feddi World
Seminary and Bromley, bitch that's Feddi World
Tapwaller way to the block, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, ay bitch that's Feddi World
Bitch that's Feddi World, rest in peace Dre Feddi, girl
It's filled
