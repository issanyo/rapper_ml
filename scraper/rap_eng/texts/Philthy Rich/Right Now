[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I know my ex bitch mad, made the ho pack her bags
She a xanny head and poppin' tags and fryin' facts
Faygo cotton candy, drop a deuce in the twenty ounce
Foreign paint candy, on the weekend probably bring it out
Thick redbone like my ex bitch Letty
Two hundred thou in cash, your baby daddy money petty
I'm the wrong nigga at the show to try to push up on
Beat a nigga ass in the crowd if he lookin' wrong
F&N stuffed in the pesos hoodie
Spending ten dollars on a 5X hoodie
Me a Lil Tommie count a hundred thou, all new
Big face benjis, hundred dollar bills, all blue

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
Whole lot of cash on us
I was broke but a nigga came up
I'm still the thug I was
I need the same more love
Girl you know you fuckin' with a boss, yeah
Aw yeah, I'm the type of nigga you should call yeah
You got what I need, I want it
I need more racks and less talkin'
Purple my cup make me fade away
You actors Denzel, no training day
This Glock bless a nigga, amazing grace
Broad day, bang mask, no face no case

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 3: Slimmy B]
What you got for me right now
Yeah bitch, right now
Checkin' chickens daily, 'nother twenty bands wipe down
In the early morning, told 'em bring the steak and rice out
Got niggas locked up so you know I'm shipping kites out
Rollie plain jane, tryna turn it to a bust down
Same hoes curved me same hoes wanna fuck now
Was broke a year ago, I can't lie but I'm up now
In the field slidin', tryna score like a touchdown
Seminary to the sea, a broke bitch I can't be
Twelve-hundred for the kicks, another band for the teeth
VVS on my neck, catch these hoes if you reach
Never trickin', I'm a pimp
For this dick it's a fee bitch

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
