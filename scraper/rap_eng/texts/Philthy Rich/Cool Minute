[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Cool minute since I fucked on my ex bitch
Cool minute nigga sipped on Qualitest
Cool minute since I gave a fuck about a bitch
If it ain't about no money ain't tryna hit that shit
Yeah nine days, bitch I'm in a foreign whip
In my passenger seat there's a foreign bitch
Yeah my money right, I'm on the Forbes list
And this Rollie on my wrist you can't afford this
Cool minute since I fucked with them broke niggas
Heard the nigga snitchin' so I cut his rope nigga
Nigga's tryna use me to stay afloat nigga
Still good in my hood, you's a joke nigga
Bitch, my money tall, your money low nigga
Yeah your bitch tell me you been runnin' low nigga
Fill my cup up, it's kind of low nigga
Bitch before I was a rapper was a dope dealer, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]

[Verse 2: J. Stalin]
I fucked a nigga bitch in a cool minute
I don't fuck with suckers they be stool pigeons
Niggas tellin' but we be still sellin'
That's why she wanna fuck with a felon
I catch a nigga slippin', draw down and split his melon
I'm a West Oakland nigga, project figure
Knocked the baddest bitch in the game just like I'm Jigga
I ain't never backed down and ran from no nigga
Bitches get the picture when they see these foreigns
Ain't no jumpin' in the car bitch if you ain't on
I'm a Livewire nigga bitch, but they ain't knowin'
Get some head, drop your pretty ass off in the morning
I be knockin' niggas' bitches posted right on the corner
She wanna jump up in the Benz and go where I'm goin'
You lil bucket-head bitch you can't go where I'm goin', ah
Bitch you can't go where I'm goin'

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I hit the block (the block)
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I knocked a thot (a thot)
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I hit a lick (hit a lick)
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I fucked your bitch
Cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute

[Verse 3: Lil Blood]
I ain't drank no purple Acty in a year, it's been a cool minute
Put no coke or dogfood in my nose because I'm cool with it
Can't fuck her like a whore because she broke, I let my dude hit it
If I bust my gun I make it count, I make the news with it
Dangerous, come from the pavement, I keep my stainless
Gangster, I keep a banger, I leave you brainless
Wangster, and you a wangster, I leave you chainless
Hundred-stick, I thrown this hundred-stick at who you hang with
Baby in the VIP with her she tryna make it pop
Tonight might be the night, it's been a minute since I fucked a thot
And she's black as fuck but on my mama this bitch hella thick
The way she stick her tongue out, you can tell this bitch suck hella dick
Wow, wow, wow wow wow wow
[?] heard as fuck, told the bitch let's go
Took her to the car, she proceeded to give me throat
When I came in her throat she proceeded and didn't choke, Blood

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I hit the block (the block)
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I knocked a thot (a thot)
It's been a while since I (since I)
Since I hit a lick (hit a lick)
It's been a while since I (since I)

Cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute
It's been a cool minute, it's been a cool minute, cool minute
