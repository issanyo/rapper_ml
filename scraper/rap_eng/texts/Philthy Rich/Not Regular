[Intro: Yhung T.O.]
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
L-Finguz

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm not a regular nigga, I don’t date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that’s two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two

[Verse 1: Yhung T.O.]
All of my niggas be wildin'
Catch an opp, then we shoot, ain't no pausin'
I really came from the bottom
Everything that I wanted, I bought it
I wanted a foreign, I bought it
She want designer, I bought it
Heard that you dissin', I caught it
Fuckin' other bitches, you caught it
I got VV's in these Cartis
My bitch like Nicki, she Barbie
I know deep down that you for me
I got three Glocks in a four seat
Drop a hundred on niggas, stay ballin'
Left to right like dominos
You put your trust up inside these hoes
I put my trust up inside this pole
I put some diamonds inside this gold
Drip, drip, all my diamonds froze
Drip, drip, I be blowin’ fours
New bag but this money old
I know these niggas be up in they feelings
We just like Porsches and Benzes
Philthy pull up in that Wraith
It ain’t shit to let your friends in

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm not a regular nigga, I don’t date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two
I’m not a regular nigga, I don't date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I ain't a regular nigga (Uh-uh)
I don't fuck regular bitches (Bad bitches)
I don't be regular shoppin' (Ball hard)
These ain't regular Christians (It's Philthy)
I don't count regular money (A hundred thou')
I don't got regular diamonds (VS1's)
I don't wear regular clothes (Fuck is that?)
This ain't regular designer (It's Philthy)
I don't sip regular syrup (Actavis)
I don't smoke regular gas (It's loud)
I don't drive regular cars (It's foreign)
This ain't no regular gas (It's Philthy)
Hi-Tech red but the hundreds blue
Cop a new foreign in a month or two
Told the bitch to roll up a blunt or two
Niggas clout chasin', what it's comin' to
Fuck my enemies, I'm havin' foreign keys
Cuban on my neck cost a hundred G's
In the trap with a hundred P's
Keep the F&N when I come and leave
Bitches sellin' pussy on POF
Free Christian Fifth, he got three more left
Almost sold out, I got a kilo left
Nigga play with me and you will see your death, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm not a regular nigga, I don't date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two
I'm not a regular nigga, I don't date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two

[Verse 3: Guapdad 4000]
Ayy, Scamboy, I'ma take change
Download pros and egg P's
Every chair I got is a lazy
Every watch I look at is AP
If Po spray, it's an AK
Want me in your brand, I need is 8K
HBO and Lil Dicky stay late
I get paid to act, you just play play
Fucked an IG model with 250K
She told me she got nowhere to stay
I told her, "Give me all your money
From the Fashion Nova, so you got somewhere to pay"
B&B, plus I got somewhere to lay
I don't pay rent in the Bay
Women like her get bent in the Bay
Hoes like her get sent in the Bay
Frost like Dior pics, my fist so cold
Need a Moncler to try to knock me, 'cause my bitch so cold
I'm a West Oakland scammer, but I got benjis like an OG
I'm with Philthy, I'm with TO, I'm in LA, shout out 03

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm not a regular nigga, I don't date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two
I'm not a regular nigga, I don't date regular bitches
Baby, all I drive is foreign, I'm not a regular nigga
I'm not the niggas you used to, I need a bitch look like NuNu
I let you match me so that's two coupes, I got Tutu in this two-two

[Outro: Guapdad 4000]
Ayy, yeah
See that's what you don't understand, baby
It's nothin' normal about what's goin' on
If I'm normal then I'ma be a Neiman Marcus normal
It's not a regular amount of normal, it's just a different thing
And if you can't even get it, if that just sound funny to you
That just sound like some type of joke
Then that just let me know that we never gon' be on the same page
'Cause all my pages is Prada and that's just how I'm rockin'
I swear I'm fuckin' with
So if you can't get with the Valentino Viper
You gon' die from the venom, bitch
L-Finguz
Shout out my brother Philthy, man
Yeah, it's a check
