[Intro]
It's Philthy
You ever been out the country lil nigga
Ayy ma let's take a trip
Treat yourself, don't cheat yourself, uh-huh

[Chorus]
Presidential suite cost me like a thou a night
Leave the bathroom door open when I fall asleep at night
Told the captain drop the anchor so the ho can see the yacht
Louis swim shorts, designer on me when you think it's not
Wet t-shirt contest at Mango Deck
The resort all exclusive but I ain't went to Mingo yet
Ride horse on the beach with a bad Asian bitch
While these locals rappers complain 'bout a Say Cheese list, I'm in Cabos bitch, it's Philthy

[Verse 1]
Leave the SFO on a first class flight
Bitch I used to be broke but I got my cash right
I been ridin' these jet skis in the winter time
One hand on the wheel while me and your bitch FaceTime
Cuban cigars and 1942 (ayy free Meek)
The day day forty-one, the Skydweller forty-two
Two mountains will never meet but two niggas will
When it's pressure better keep it on you when you in the field
Kick the cup challenge, can't lie, I been off balance
Ruth Chriss for the lobster mack and the house salad
Celebratin' life, happy birthday to my nigga Pretty
Mandela, New Year's Eve, all the women pretty, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Presidential suite cost me like a thou a night
Leave the bathroom door open when I fall asleep at night
Told the captain drop the anchor so the ho can see the yacht
Louis swim shorts, designer on me when you think it's not
Wet t-shirt contest at Mango Deck
The resort all exclusive but I ain't went to Mingo yet
Ride horse on the beach with a bad Asian bitch
While these locals rappers complain 'bout a Say Cheese list, I'm in Cabos bitch, it's Philthy

[Verse 2]
Ride hot, can't change nothin' for the breakfast
They know I'm havin' money so they want a lil extra
I really hate when she leave, let's ride ATV's
Foreign exchange at customs, had eighteen G's
Niggas tearin' down billboards in the opps' hood
Just keep the same energy, hope you can box good
You niggas' opinions don't matter, you can keep 'em to yourself
Them CD's ain't sellin', takin' room up on the shelf
If you ask me I think these niggas really need a buzz
I been at the dealership test driving Bentley trucks
My sister say all I do is buy hella chains
Bitch you the only one trippin', my jeweler ain't complain
It's Philthy

[Chorus]
Presidential suite cost me like a thou a night
Leave the bathroom door open when I fall asleep at night
Told the captain drop the anchor so the ho can see the yacht
Louis swim shorts, designer on me when you think it's not
Wet t-shirt contest at Mango Deck
The resort all exclusive but I ain't went to Mingo yet
Ride horse on the beach with a bad Asian bitch
While these locals rappers complain 'bout a Say Cheese list, I'm in Cabos bitch, it's Philthy
