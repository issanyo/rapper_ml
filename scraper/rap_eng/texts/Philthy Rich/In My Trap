[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
Get my pack
Get my gun, get my bomb
Pull up foreign, shit, pull off foreign
Codeine in my lungs, I don't even know where I'm goin'
Ain't no pressure on the block
Young nigga sellin' on the block
Learned a lot of shit on the block
Young nigga settin' up shop
We ain't gon' play around with these boys
We ain't gon' play around with these toys
Treat these whips just like they toys, yeah
Drive these cars just like they toys, yeah
We get to the money, I know what they love, yeah
I walked in the club, they know I got my slug here
Now they lookin' at me, how he got these drugs here?
I jumped off the porch, jumped in a brand new Lamborghini
Went from sellin' dope, robbin' niggas, servin' cement
Went from eating noodles, now lobster fettuccini
Ran the money way way up, you wouldn't believe it

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
New foreign with the roof gone, no rebate, no coupon
Rose gold bust down Patek, no stainless steel, no two-tone
Thirty thou on a new chain, told a broke nigga keep the loose change
Red bottoms, no shoe strings, this Actavis give me mood swings
Rollie on with the big rocks, turn my bitch spot into a trap spot
Ninety days out of this spot then we relocate to the next spot
Hundred inch out of Best Buy, got a bad bitch out of Bed Stuy
Told a bitch catch a red eye, bitch you'll be here like in no time
Since I bought it I ain't set the time, ain't the same watch, this a different kind
VS1's got a different shine, man them niggas funny like Richard Prior
In the trap, I was in the trap, I ain't never seen you niggas in the trap
You ain't never bust down a pack, you ain't never greased down a MAC
Actavis with the seal on it, Hi-Tech with the seal on it
Motor four, put a deal on it, fuck you and your big homie
Sem God, bitch it's rent time, nigga pay up or get kicked out
In the trap with the stick out
We done sold out, they done missed out, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)

[Verse 3: VL Deck]
I put your bitch to work, run noon
Bitch I rap 'bout what I say, I talk how I move
Pressin' 'bout the paper, that's the only mood
Servin' out the rental, bitch been part the old school
Task force got 'em scared, bitches won't move
Block on Juvenile but this bitch still boom
Zombies in the line comin' for that dog food
Spot look like the Carter, shootin' up in the bathroom
I'm a different bracket jackin', we don't fuck with y'all
And Judo cook the best, he stretch it with the [?]
Every day I'm movin', I can't lie, I'm with the action
Nunez goin' for thirty-two, I touch 'em then I'm cappin'
If you want a sixty, got it packed off in my past street
Pints startin' to drown so these niggas startin' to tax me
And they steppin' on the dope like they tap dancing
Smokin' OG when I'm in the mountains, Uncle Larry

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)

[Outro: Johnny Cinco]
Bustdown, that's a bustdown
Try to touch my bustdown, you get bust down
All these bales get bust down, these bricks get bust down
Cali plug just touched down, we in a rush now
This my trap (this my trap)
This my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)
These my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)
Sip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)
