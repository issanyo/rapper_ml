[Intro: Lil Pete]
I just pray and hope to see another day
I just pray and hope to see another day, see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain’t never breakin' codes, talk in code names
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain’t never breakin' codes, talk in code names

[Verse 1: Lil Pete]
We ain't never breakin' codes, ever
Gang tryna put another face on the sweater
She just dropped a pin, I ain't even tell her
I can see her true colors like old sweaters
Tryna keep me humble, they keep testin'
I can never be broke, fake flexin'
And I'ma keep on pushin’ ’til we get it in
Call Phil' on the town, probably on the Sem’
Bustdown, tryna come bust down
Everything come easy, it's easy
Never breakin' codes, come around with Jeezy
I can't go like that, my people need me

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it’s a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Uh-huh, look
Fame brought BA to Harbor Road (Is that right?)
That's crazy as fuck 'cause both of them niggas told (Pussy)
Niggas phone tapped, gotta talk in codes (Hello?)
My Atlanta nigga need five hundred bows (Kilo talk)
Mom got the Rollie on but still on parole (Bust down)
Big dawg where I'm from, my hood in control (Seminary)
Tuesdays and Thursdays, you know they on patrol (You know they is)
Dice game on the block, bet the ten to four (Ayy bet it back)
Got this rap game in a figure four (It's Philthy ho)
But I'm back to the trap if it's ever slow (Swear to God)
Chinese connect still send the load (Ayy I need that)
Nigga where I'm from, boy you couldn't go
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names

[Verse 3: Prezi]
Open mouth'll get you whacked, you better freeze it homie
Tryna tell on one of mine, we gon' breathe on 'em
Russ a real nigga, he ain't tell nothin'
'Cause if he did, I swear to God I wouldn't fuck with him
Murder cases got my niggas locked up in them cages
Free Lieutenant, free PI, they ain't make a statement
Free Smoove, free Higgs, they ain't made a statement
Hate my brothers with gang tats, say we gang related
I ain't with the internet and goin' back and forth
Catch a case, they'll bang you for that in court
A better picture for my niggas, I'm just tryna paint it
Dry snitchin', we gon' call that an understatement (A rat)

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names
I just pray and hope to see another day
Yellow tapes, up and up the murder rate
The streets is real here, it's a cold game
We ain't never breakin' codes, talk in code names
