[Verse 1: CBM Lil Daddy]
Junkie at my door, tryna buy a nick
Six in the morning, got a nigga pissed
Thought it was a jugg, tryna buy a brick
Still in the trap, still makin' hits
Rerockin' bricks, still pullin' tricks
Bread up on my line, I got another fifth
Hit him with that woop-de-woo, it's over with
Smooth criminal, left no evidence
I had the MC, with the V6
Twenty-threes on that Benz, trappin' like a bitch
I was fifteen years old with a bankroll
My nigga was thirteen, layin' down them stoves
Just jumped out a new Reg' and some new Girbaud
Soldier rag 'round they head, throwin' up them fours
Thuggin' in the south side on Burgan Road
Jugged so many packs, broke so many domes

[Chorus: CBM Lil Daddy]
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (I had to)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (I had to)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Eleven years old, jumped off the porch (I swear to God)
Eleven years later, copped my first Porsche (fool)
I was trappin' like a bitch, tryna cop a zip (I was)
Turned twenty-eight grams into a thirty-six (it's Philthy nigga)
A bag of hot cheetos, they was thirty cents (oh I remember)
Seminary bitch, them niggas murder shit (Seminary)
I remember you was rich, you had nine zips (is that right?)
Now I got nine Rollies and nine whips (it's Philth)
If you ever need work you can call me (hello?)
I was trappin' outside in the [?] (four wet)
Ziploc baggie, split it four ways (four ways)
Had to stay away in the folks' way (search car)
Scrilla Mike hit the block in the drop Rari (rest in peace)
Made me want to go and hit the block a lot harder (it did)
Somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist (bustdown)
Feelin' like a dope boy when I first touched a brick (bustdown)

[Chorus: CBM Lil Daddy]
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (I had to)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
Trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (trap)
I was trappin' like a bitch, trappin' like a bitch (I had to)
