[Intro: Mozzy]
Every day struggles that I deal with
Every day struggles that I deal with
Mekanix, what's happening?
Lifestyle mad, civilian damaged
Finally attracted to this gangsta shit

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
A P89 in my PR piece
Painted with them facials, it's an easy 3
I'm the fella where I'm from, we be in these streets
Fell in love with 'em, I could never leave the streets
Mekanix line me up when I need a beat
Fetching Chicken McNuggets like I need to eat
Pouring 4 in the 20, show you how to lean
When I top nigga, badaboom, badabing
If it ain't 50 bands plus then it's not a sting
I got narks, couple Xans, what you tryna eat?
Got him going deep for that loud pack
You say it's all there but I don't trust him, gotta count that
Attempted murder ain't a murder, we don't count that
They he hit him in his face but he bounce back
Attempted murder ain't a murder, we don't count that
They he hit him in his face but he bounce back

[Hook: Mozzy]
Gucci wallet with 30k on the Chace debits
20 bands cash, Gucci and they don't take debit
Them people talking murder, niggas can't panic
Them people talking murder, niggas can't panic
All I know is this, I could never abandon it
I'm from the streets, I could never abandon it
I'm from the beach, I could never abandon it
My niggas switch on me so all I know is abandonment

[Verse 2:  Philthy Rich]
I'm from the hood bitch, know I can't abandon it
Remember the OGs was fucking with the baddest bitch
I'm still sliding round for Dre, Fetty
I took my niggas so I gotta make 'em regret it
Dane did 10, nigga sold him off
On the coffin, call it in on the stolen phone
Still screaming free Rio, waiting on the appeal
It got me in Complex and the Mass Appeal
Hip hop DX, nigga what's next?
It ain't shit if my niggas ain't here to share it with me
I could never turn my back on my neighbourhood
On the phone, my nigga mama making sure he good
And my kids mean the world to me
My bitch say she gonna give the world to me
Everything I'm toting, better hold 50
And my fans keep asking for the old Philthy

[Hook: Mozzy]
Gucci wilding with 30k on the Chace debits
20 bands cash, Gucci and they don't take debit
Them people talking murder, niggas can't panic
Them people talking murder, niggas can't panic
All I know is this, I could never abandon it
I'm from the streets, I could never abandon it
I'm from the beach, I could never abandon it
My niggas switch on me so all I know is abandonment
