[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today
Grandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today
I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I just cashed out on a lick
Feel like creating a bitch
Me and Philthy we with twenty hoes
I'm 'bout to break me a bitch
Slap a bitch with all my rings on
I beat the race off a bitch
Never fuck a bitch for free my nigga
Bitch gotta pay for the dick
I just left the jeweler, nigga got me walkin' out like it's a block of ice on my wrist
All my niggas from the trenches, please don't get offended
See police, we jumping the fence

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Young nigga handsome and wealthy
Quavo Quavo Makaveli
The money you spent on that bitch
I take the bitch and make her help me
Pull out the lot in a
Pull out the lot in a wraith
I'm on a jet
Talking on FaceTime while a bitch give me face
I'm making money, I'm getting money
Why you gon' spend it and waste it?
I'm in a corporate office with my styrofoam
White man want to taste it

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 3: Sauce Walka]
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
Buy a pint, pour a six
I might just pimp out your bitch
100 thousand dollars, breaking tricks
Taking dates and doing back flips
I'm smoking zips, I ain't selling zips
All I do is sell sauce, I send a bitch to your house
Ding ding, right at your door
I'm with Mozzy and we pouring fours
I'm with Philthy and we in a Ghost
Invisible, I feel like a ghost
Sauce Twinz, yeah we do the most
It's the reason we got all the hoes
It's the reason we do all the shows
At 19 I was thirty toes
On this and that, really sending hoes
Hitting jewelry, buying rose gold
Now I buy it by the kilo
Rose gold, subzero
Kick a nigga's ass for the cash
Spill spill spill spill, split then dash
I worked hard to be a rich nigga
I prayed to god to be a rich nigga

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today
Grandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today

I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 4: Philthy Rich]
I'm feeling rich today
My bitches hit for 20K
Now they one week and one day
You broke hoes is just in the way
The Sauce Twinz was just in the Bay
We was just up in the Wraith
Salute to the nigga Mac Dre
I pimp on that ho like Mac Dre
I fired four hoes at one time
Never had four hoes at one time
Never had four hoes in your life
I'm sipping a cup of the slime
I tell that ho look and she listen
One look from the ho and she missing
The roof on the foreigns, they missing
Your diamonds, they don't really glisten
Designer is on me, I'm dripping
The iron is on me, don't tempt me
Broke niggas mad so they dissing
But no I don't pay it no 'ttention
I got the bitch down on mission
I told the ho what is the mission?
She only call about chicken
The Jackson's, Grant's, and Benjamin's

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

Grandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today

I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 5: Jose Guapo]
I'm feeling rich today
I might fuck your bitch today
Might flood out my wrist today
Might go hit a lick today
I might smoke a zip today
Today I might drink me an eight
Tomorrow might drink me an eight
Damn I might drink a whole pint
I come in steppin' in Maison Margielas
I got my durag but no I'm not Stella
I got my racks open, no I won't let up
I'm finna go ice out the brand new bezel
Piped up, young rich nigga
Never cared about a bitch nigga
Middle finger to a bitch nigga
It's fuck you and your bitch nigga
I pay a cost to get you knocked off
Head honcho, nigga I'm the boss
Let her give me head right on the couch
Fuck on the bitch and I'm kicking her out
I got designer all over my house
They wanna come first, they know what I'm 'bout
I'm a young nigga that's coming with clout
Spend 100K just on my mouth

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
