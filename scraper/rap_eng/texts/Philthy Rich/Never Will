[Chorus: Yowda]
I'm forever on some other shit
Never switched up on them niggas that I'm fuckin' with
They say never say never so I never will
They on some sucker shit, I always keep it real
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will

[Verse 1: Yowda]
I ain't never hated on the next man for getting his money
I ain't never fucked on no bitch that belonged to the homie
I ain't never ratted on a nigga, I ain't never told
Right or wrong, if the homie ride then damn right I rode
I done sold it all, from crumb sacks to them bricks my nigga
I done boosted clothes, I done shoplifts, I hit licks my nigga
I done went to the pen for shit niggas got probation for
Did the same crime but got different time, I'm just sayin' though
I done been to the feds nigga, they don't cop no deals
Either niggas cooperate, or niggas wait on they appeal
See money don't make you real, being broke don't mean you fake
And just 'cause he ain't got scales, don't mean he ain't no snake

[Chorus: Yowda]
I'm forever on some other shit
Never switched up on them niggas that I'm fuckin' with
They say never say never so I never will
They on some sucker shit, I always keep it real
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I ain't never spoke on your gangster
When I put you on and expect no thank you
Never think the money gon' make you
It's only so far it's gon' take you
I just rolled a K to my nigga
Told him never let the white man break you
I was right there when they spanked you
The victim's family so grateful
When they throw the deal we just take 'em
Take it to the box, the stupid ass wop
Suuwoop it up for my block
I ain't never fold on the gun line off
It was me and bruh when we knocked blood off
They'll never know unless a real nigga talk
Secret society my nigga
They'll never know unless a real nigga talk, yeah
Slithered up for that score
I'll never not go to war
We ain't finna shoot the house up
But we'll bring it to a nigga's grandmother's door
It's still fourth 'til my corpse
Never take a trip with no dork
Allahu ackbar, I don't fuck with no pork
Period, seriously nigga

[Chorus: Yowda]
I'm forever on some other shit
Never switched up on them niggas that I'm fuckin' with
They say never say never so I never will
They on some sucker shit, I always keep it real
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
Look, codeine in my Ros√© bottle
Ayy pour the whole pint but bitch keep the bottle
Elevation requires seperation
Demonstration for a sticky situation
Thick bitch and she hot yellow
Eighty thousand on my Skydweller
Designer on me, I'm a fly fella
A nigga at the bank tryna knock the teller
A hundred thou in my business account
Turn it down for the right amount
Ask about me, I ain't never went out
Plug told me fuck with him and it ain't never a drought
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Yowda]
I'm forever on some other shit
Never switched up on them niggas that I'm fuckin' with
They say never say never so I never will
They on some sucker shit, I always keep it real
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
I never will, I never will, I never will
