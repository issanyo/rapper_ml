[Verse 1]
Last month I spent a 100 thousand
A new front going 100 miles
All this money never running out
Don't push the niggas or is running mouth
Gotta suv really coming out
I can see the hate when you come around
Acting like he don't know me now
Only fuck with me when he had the time
Gassing out with a new cannon
Bout to leave a nigga on a newspaper
Nigga ran off with a burden
Think I catch up with you later
A 100 100 that's 10 thou
200 50's that's 10 thou
500 20's that's 10 thou
A lot of peas gotta sit down
See I don't need the whole 30 cliff boy
I can get it down 10
Now he talking bout how he wants 10 numbers
Pulling up boy I'm still in ups
See all these force ain't ringing none
Bad bitches I'm selling 'em
That ben talk he never been in one
I couldn't wait till I been in one

[Chorus]
This whole thing came back 36
I ain't got no extras
Anywhere that is hot take left
I ain't got no extras
Thousand hundred two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras
Hit the stow for some rub mans quick
I ain't got no extras
Whole thing came back 36
I ain't got no extras
Anywhere that is hot take left
I ain't got no extras
Thousand hundred two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras
Hit the stow for some rub mans quick
I ain't got no extras

[Verse 2]
Double cut my style for this hot bitch take no money
All this is hoe money if you don't know now you know dummy
Seminary with the clip long SE1
Diamonds on me VS1's them broke niggas never seen none
Pulled up in a rave I can see the hate all in their face
Left I ain't parked in the hood like eight they straight
All caps now slaughter this bitch I don't know what they think
I've been getting money for a minute nigga your a couple years late
Bussed down this Rollie's got diamonds all in my face
Bussed down this brick residue all on this play
If they counted me out guess them niggas can't count
A couple thousand short date then fucked up my count
It's filthy nigga

[Chorus]
Whole thing came back 36
I ain't got no extras
Anywhere that is hot take left
I ain't got no extras
Thousand hundred two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras
Hit the stow for some rub mans quick
I ain't got no extras
Whole thing came back 36
I ain't got no extras
Anywhere that is hot take left
I ain't got no extras
Thousand hundred two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras
Hit the stow for some rub mans quick
I ain't got no extras
