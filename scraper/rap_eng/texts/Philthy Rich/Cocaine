[Verse 1]
They bay you got the line on the plug down there
Shit I got a trunk full
Giving out a deal
Slow down did the speed limit chill watch the troopers
Don’t smoke no weed in here
Put your seatbelt on make this look good gotta make a deal
They know we coming right
Tell em get that money together so when we get there we can get Out of there
No funny shit

[Verse 2]
Vegas trips tryna make fight time
Like yesterday me myself was risking a life time
If they caught they box I would’ve caught life though
On a I-80 west with a trunk full of white coke
Pulled over traffic stop behind me the white folks
My paper straight my liscense good so I should be aight though
I’m in the midwest state with New York plates
The last thing I need is a new court case
One car two compartments each of them hold 5 keys
F*ck wholesale each of them is thirty five g’s
I still got bitches that’ll board that plane
Two carry on’s one Luis luxury to hold cocaine
Lord blessed we done make them trips and made it back
With that soft yeah we had to cook that shit to make it crack
Make them pop that like two coast don’t play you like that
It’s about the bread we got that coast start spraying like that

[Verse 3]
Some city money flat
I swear to God I’m in the booth with the hammer on me
In the kitchen with the chickens on my hammer on me
The sky dwelling look [?] in the band
The bitch picking up a hundred twenty when she land
That’s thirty a piece n*gga
Cooking up a thousand grams in the pan
These squaw man I spent a couple thousand on these pants
Cream mainly got correl like a nine pack
Plus four p’s and they found fifty g’s
That’s a weight clause n*gga f*ck the stay loss
Tried to offer more time when they ain’t soft
Meanwhile I made back on my to-do list
That’s another two hundred thou on a new whip
And copper keep telling me to slow down
But I just love how these rollies look bus down
I’m on worldstar in the top box now
You can facetime me when the box touch down
Spilt

[Hook]
Cocaine in the back of the ride
