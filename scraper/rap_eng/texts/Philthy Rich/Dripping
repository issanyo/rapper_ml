[Intro: FMB DZ]
Drippin', hah, yeah we drippin', hah
Too much sauce got me drippin'
Whoa, all this sauce got me drippin'

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
So much sauce got me drippin'
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention, hey
So much sauce got me drippin', hey
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention

[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
Had them boys blow the whistle like a referee
Got off my ass, bein' broke was gettin' the best of me
Now a nigga got the sauce and the recipe
Just know he hundred times a hundred if he next to me
Them niggas that I got around, they my family
I came up from nothin', why these niggas mad at me?
I'm big homie, ain't no nigga threw no bag at me
Rich homie, bad ho split that ass on me
Niggas get motivated, hear me on the beat
Be a whole bunch of lies whenever you speak
Me and my niggas be outside whenever it's beef
I need the six car garage and the crib off the beach
Watch who you have around, these niggas'll leech
I seened it with my own two eyes how niggas'll skeet
I want to get my mans back, they tagged his feet
A nigga gotta pay for that, I'm payin' a fee

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
So much sauce got me drippin'
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention, hey
So much sauce got me drippin', hey
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Did a little Gucci with the Christian Loub
Bitch pussy dry, she need to get the lube
You ain't got enough money bitch to get these shoes
That nigga went broke, you ain't get the news?
Almost lost my diamond ring in the club
I was in that bitch throwin' thousand ones
Nigga where you from just a thousand bums
They ain't check us at the door, we got a thousand guns
She got the double G's and the double C's
Them other hoes sick, bless 'em when they sneeze
Me smokin' big B in the big sleeve
We smoked out the suite, security made us leave, it's Philthy

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
So much sauce got me drippin'
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention, hey
So much sauce got me drippin', hey
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention

[Verse 3: FMB DZ]
Fifty thousand in the bag, not to mention
Four five next to that with the extension
Everybody ducking and running, I started spittin'
Slim Dunkin the pussy, Blake Griffin
Snakes on my collar, you can hear 'em hissin' (Gucci)
Pull up with them tools, bitch I do the fixin'
I get water, put them hitters on a mission
I'm locked in with Cash Click out in Richmond
Cali boys comin' in, yeah they land and run
You don't want to get no money, you still playin' around
I'm in the club actin' an ass, you just standin' around
Ordered up a thousand ones, you go right in the mouth

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
So much sauce got me drippin'
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention, hey
So much sauce got me drippin', hey
All this water on me got me drippin'
We done poured a whole pint, we still sippin'
Rolled up a whole zip, not to mention
