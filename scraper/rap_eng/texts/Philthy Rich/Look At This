[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
I got ice on my wrist, hey, drank in my piss
Knocked your bank off a bitch, that say I came up kinda quick
Nigga came a long way from the trap, look at this
I put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this
Got these haters kinda pissed, I spent bandos on my kicks
Live ammo in the clip, told that bitch I'm filthy rich
Came a long way from the trap, look at this
Put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I say, start rappin' in '06
I slap the piss out a ho bitch
She ain't know I was a cold pimp
In a Rolls Royce with no tints
When I'm in the city I'm in Oakcliff
DN with me got the four-fifth
Bad bitch from KOD's tryna pull up on me, tell her catch a Lyft
Designer on me then catch the drip
VLONE on my collar bitch
Givenchy sweater cost two thousand
With all these Rottweilers on it bitch
Rap facts, yeah he on the list
New foreign, I'm on the owner list
Ex bitch in my phone and shit
I don't want the ho, I disown the bitch
Eight thou all on the wrist, another sixty on the bracelet
Las Vegas, spent ten thou in thirty minutes up in Gucci bitch
Niggas worse than a groupie bitch
If your chain fake we can't take a pic
Thick bitch that can't take the dick
She scream a nigga's name, got the neighbors sick, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
I got ice on my wrist, hey, drank in my piss
Knocked your bank off a bitch, that say I came up kinda quick
Nigga came a long way from the trap, look at this
I put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this
Got these haters kinda pissed, I spent bandos on my kicks
Live ammo in the clip, told that bitch I'm filthy rich
Came a long way from the trap, look at this
Put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this

[Verse 2: Yella Beezy]
Ayy, bitch I'm rich, filthy, ayy, cuban cost a fifty, ayy
Diamond water drippin', ayy, you gas hoes cannot milk, ayy
Henny got me tipsy, ayy, stylin' in the Bentley, ayy
Trippin' like I'm Nipsey, ayy, nigga rollin' sixty, crippin', ayy
You gotta be consistent, ayy, I'm ranked in my division, ayy
That oil got me trippin', ayy, kind of fuckin' up my vision, ayy
When you niggas pussy, hidin', takin' shots, be specific
Took a brief intermission, ayy, ain't no time for interventions, ayy
Fuck worker, I'm a boss, paid the cost, I'ma floss
Double M's, in a vault, I'm a player, ain't throwin' salt
Forty racks, what it cost, bitch gettin' tossed, in the loft
Sippin' syrup, ain't got a cough, how you blowin' money but ain't got a house?

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
I got ice on my wrist, hey, drank in my piss
Knocked your bank off a bitch, that say I came up kinda quick
Nigga came a long way from the trap, look at this
I put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this
Got these haters kinda pissed, I spent bandos on my kicks
Live ammo in the clip, told that bitch I'm filthy rich
Came a long way from the trap, look at this
Put the city on the map, ain't no doubt, look at this
