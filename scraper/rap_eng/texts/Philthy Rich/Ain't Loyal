[Intro]
These niggas is some snakes, and they ain't loyal

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
You supposed to be my mans nigga
But you just really want my bands nigga
Why you mad 'cause I’m rich nigga
I fed you, now I think that you might snitch nigga, oh naw

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, I done put so many niggas in position (I have)
Then they changed on me, so I switched hittin' (pussy)
Gave them all the game but they didn’t listen (they didn't listen)
Nigga really hating on me from a distance (it's Philthy ho)
They just want the spot that I worked for (is that right?)
Mad that the prices on my work low (it is)
Mad that this Rollie is a forty-one (bust down)
Ain't got no papers on it, that's a stolen one (it's Philthy)
Niggas ain't loyal, learned the hard way (uh-uh)
Put them niggas on and they all changed (they all changed)
Got the bad news when the call came (hello?)
Karma came back on them broad day, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
You supposed to be my mans nigga
But you just really want my bands nigga
Why you mad 'cause I’m rich nigga
I fed you, now I think that you might snitch nigga, oh naw

[Verse 2: Team Eastside Peezy]
Ayy, niggas telling like this shit normal
Gotta watch your day one, he might be an informant
Niggas out here wearing wires, yeah voice recording
Real niggas getting jammed and snitches coming home
I stopped answering the phone and I don't reply to texts
New indictments coming out, you never know who next
I'm only fucking with the family and nothing else
Niggas being paperwork so they can save theyself
Why you asking all these questions, lift your shirt up nigga
Who sent you over here and who you work with nigga?
Twenty years of prison just ain't worth it nigga
Praying for the best, prepared for the worst my nigga

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal no more
You supposed to be my mans nigga
But you just really want my bands nigga
Why you mad 'cause I’m rich nigga
I fed you, now I think that you might snitch nigga, oh naw
