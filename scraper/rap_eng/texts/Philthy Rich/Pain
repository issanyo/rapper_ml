[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting in hell's den watching murder like a show on
Shot em in cold blood like he was beefing with the snow on
He ain't really deserve it but that's life and that must go on
Praying we get it right, knowing some how that we gon' go wrong
It ain't no point of being real when everybody joking
Niggas hit the corner with cheese, now everybody smoking
Probably to numb away the pain from a deeper wound
Sick of singing blue so they move into a deeper tune
15 for the stripes, he ain't fighting shit
He bout that fireworks, self-employed how he lighting shit
Realizing if he get caught he gon' be [?] shit
Pussy told the DEA, fuck a statement, he ain't writing shit
Blood nigga nuts hanging like elephantitis
Devil forgot the key, [?] Becky just waiting to ignite us
It's all the same, tell em where I'm from it's messed up
Where niggas lose their life for disrespect, niggas so messed up

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say he used to be the man, now he's begging for a grand
$2 ass nigga can't lend a helping hand
Yeah he used to be good, he had to work for that jug
He turned his back on his niggas and went and state on the hood
That statement can't take back, regret that he made that
Sat down and trial and error, recorded tape, they played that
No icontact now, but I used to look up to him
I used to wanna be just like him, now I just spite him
Snitching ain't condoned, even to my closest kin
Yeah I'm getting money now and I was getting money then
Just still popping off, ain't nothing boring the hood
Sin city money man I'm whipping forms thrugh the hood
Times done changed, BG's now OG's
Used to be 25, damn near 40 for the ki
Better outlook at life, better know how to cook the white
Soft to the hard, hard niggas turn to soft

[Verse 3: J. Stalin]
My lil nigga lost his twin and I know he hurt
Tossed a dark cloud over the whole west
Packers wouldn't even let him out to go and pay respect
Last month I seen a good nigga get put to rest
Tryna do my best to hold back the tears
Cause if you living up in Oakand, you living in fear
Nigga we break the homicide record every year
I don't know what you looking for but love don't live here
It's crack babies selling crack around here
Them lil niggas is strapped so hear me loud and clear
Ain't nothing but dope fiends, bums and red rum
You ain't got a gun, better run when them niggas come
Swear to God I wake up every morning, get to see the sun
My niggas is dying, wasting money by the ton
I'm tryna smoke away the pain but I'm killing my lungs
My brother gone, now it's on me to teach his son
