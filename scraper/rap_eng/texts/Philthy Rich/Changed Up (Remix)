[Intro: Scotty Cain]
Yo
It's Scotty Corleone nigga
Never forget that
Gang, ayy, what, what, look

[Verse 1: Scotty Cain]
Never changed up, got my change up
Play with Scotty, that'll get you banged up
Bust down Rollie, spent some change for it
Loyal shooters, they'll up and bang for me
Been thuggin', came in the game thuggin'
Whacked my shooter 'cause that nigga changed on me
Yeah, and fuck the nigga, I put my name on it
Sip the four, clutch a four nigga
On the foreign spent a whole fifty
Ho nigga made a diss about me
I'm sittin' back like this a bold nigga
Fuck it, now I gotta show this nigga
Gave it to him, the whole figure
Pulled up with the stick cocked
Up and pop popped like an older nigga
Whip look like it's stolen nigga
Forgiatos steady rollin' nigga
Yeah, got a nigga's bitch in it
She give me dome, got the sickest memory
MAC-11 with the thirty in it
Bitch you know what I'm holdin' nigga
Caught a body, nigga say I stole him
Nigga stole from me so I stole his livin'
Fuck with Philthy, nigga at your neck
Nigga up the TEC, put it in his chest
I beat the case, you know a nigga blessed
Then I came home and dropped another hit
Pimped a bitch while I broke your bitch
Whole clique got Rollies bitch
Your bitch practice with it
Like I hold the mic for a show is how she holdin' dick, gang

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
Niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Niggas mad at me 'cause I been doin' me
Before I met you nigga I was doin' me
I been havin' me, I been in the streets
It might be new to you but it ain't new to me
Bitch I make money, music, and enemies
Pussy niggas, all they did was envy me
They like when you broke, they hate you when you rich
That ain't my fault my nigga, I ain't make you snitch
The best offense is defense
He passin' out names at the precinct
Fuck what you had in the past tense
'Cause I accepted you nigga as is
He was on paperwork way before I met him
Niggas tried to kill him and I wouldn't let 'em
Niggas tried to tell me but I wouldn't hear 'em
Man I couldn't believe it 'til I finally read 'em, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
Niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up

[Verse 3: Jay Fizzle]
Niggas act like bitches 'cause my chain jump
I can't trust these bitches 'cause they change up
Hundred on that chopper what I aim for
Pull up on a nigga, it get dangerous
More money I make, the more problems that's comin' with it
You can't keep it one hundred, can't even keep it just fifty
My cousin say you gettin' too much money, now switch your pivot
The niggas who was comin' around us done started switchin'
Called up Philthy, Philthy where the bitches?
He pulled up with four, I smashed two, then we switched
Big Backwood, livin' life 'cause I'm rich
Laughin' at these haters who done fucked around and switched
Used to rockin' G-Shock, now I'm rockin' Rollies
Used to ride in steamers, now a nigga ridin' foreigns
Used to have a whole lot of niggas 'round me
'Til I ran my paper up, now they can't hang around me, nah

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
Niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
