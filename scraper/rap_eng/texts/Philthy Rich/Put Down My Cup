[Intro: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck

[Verse 1: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Codeine got me numb, my head in the sky
Bad redbone bitch, don't tell me no lies
Always on the cloud, I'm seein' my highs
Drop a deuce in the twenty ounce then I just fly
All the drank went up, it been a drought
Would've had a glass pint but I sent it out
Nigga paid a hundred line, I'm all the way out
Got manners when I eat, I close my mouth
You told on your own self then they ran in your house
See my nigga write a statement, he turn to a mouse
Feds still on our ass, tryna wiggle out
Had to switch up the hustle, gotta figure it out

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say now Actavis in my kidney
Got a bad bitch in my Bentley
Styrofoam got two cups
A line of Act, that's two bucks
Broke niggas say that's too much
Baby mama want to do lunch
Told the bitch she gotta choose up
Brought the wifeys with her, that's a group hug
Got a bad bitch out in Flint
But she can't pay her rent
Bitch can't pay her pimp
Pick my cup up again (is that right?)
Drop a four in my twenty ounce
Pineapple Fanta if they runnin' out
You know I fuck with them Faygos
Stackin' up pints like legos
Money nuts on the draco
Play with me and get a halo
Sippin' syrup, no maple
Your bitch suck below the navel
Versace all on my bedsheets
In the kitchen with the eggbeat
Your baby mama she a dead freak
Keep the bitch out of leg reach, it's Philthy

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck

[Verse 3: 9000 Rondae]
Two percs got my mind gone, ain't no stain liftin' the styrofoam
If the juice got a nigga movin' slow, I can make the call and get a nigga gone
What we doin', how you want to play it?
Can't slip, niggas ain't playin'
Baby girl know I'm high as fuck
I don't even remember what I just said
If you got it and they want it they stickin' you up
Fuck the other side, the boys gon' keep pickin' 'em up
Said I was done with that strap, I keep pickin' it up
Don't ever say how we react, just know we get it done
I can't tell you 'bout the shit that we done really done
I just knew that shit got sick when it started gettin' fun
I can't tell they ass too much, already came once
And I keep pickin' up that cup, I can't get enough

[Chorus: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
Tried to put down my cup, still pickin' it up
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck
I'm abusing all these drugs, not giving a fuck

[Verse 4: Molly Brazy]
Abusing the drugs, pourin' a four in my cup
Stuff an eighty in a wood and I'm good
Fuck you lil bitch, yeah I'm faced and I don't give a fuck
He in love with the Molly but I love nobody
I'm in love with the money, I need it
Leave a nigga fiendin', see my neck freezin'
Nigga with or without you I'm eatin'
All you do is speak on shit you don't know
When I'm out your nigga want a photo
Say she not all on my dick, no you ain't with the shits
The Molly all up in her throat though
Austin Powers, sip lean is my mojo
What you want, I'ma tell you what they go for
Tote the draco when I go in go mode
Smokin' cookie, got me movin' slow-mo

[Outro: Molly Brazy]
Ayy, we got pounds, we got molly, we got percs, shit
I'm blowin' a Wood right now
Sippin' on that straight drop with my money gettin' niggas
Haha, 9000 Rondae in this bitch
My nigga ShredGang Lonnie, ayy
What up Philthy? hahaha, Brazy
