[Verse 1 - Mozzy]
I'ma drill him if I come so dont call for nothing
It's all or nothing, with your [?], were be plucking humans
Running from this gangster shit and you go running to it
They say there's dollars on my noggin', tell them come and do it
Murder music, thats the sound of the drum humming (bladadah)
Cold body, heart frozen, I don't lovin nothing
We made a hundred til they spill a nigga bowl of noodles
We wont purchase, we just take it, we exposing poodles
Next body on you dawg ain't no excuses
Fuck all that verbal gangsta shit, you gotta show and prove it
We popping jumpers on these suckers
Niggas know we hooping
You dont take initiative when you suppose to do it
Im from the p we in the streets
I brung Oakland through it, Mozzy hoodies on
And you know the [?] through it
Hes selling thumpers out his phone
Im just strolling though it
Finna cop it for the youngins they be in the smoke too

[Hook - Philthy Rich]
I said there's money on my head, the niggas want me dead
I gotta keep a weapon, I need it for protection
My chopper filled with led, I need them niggas dead
So Lord please forgive 'em its time to apply pressure

I said there's money on my head, the niggas want me dead
I gotta keep a weapon, I need it for protection
My chopper filled with led, I need them niggas dead
So Lord please forgive 'em its time to apply pressure

[Verse 2 - Philthy Rich]
I said now 50 on the bounty I been in and out the county
Cut the snake niggas off, only real niggas around me
Money on my head but its a thirty on my leg
You can't funk when you're broke and your shooters ain't fed
Bounce out and I do that, bear faced no durag
If I don't get it done then I'ma slide back and do that
Me, Mozzy and Blow we autopilot that hoe
Yes she got my funds up, so I got my guns up
Local rappers dissing til they end up on the local news
Fifty one suspects in the ICU
These nigga talk tough but they dont want no [?]
Ten man, no whores, shouts out to Oak Park
I'm signing with the p, I'm sliding for the beef
[?] get your blocked popped at
My young niggas will do that for some Jordans and True hat
It's Philthy nigga

[Hook - Philthy Rich]
I said there's money on my head, the niggas want me dead

[Verse 3 - Joe Blow
They say there's chickens on my fitted
So my clip extended
I handle business really get it
You in that bitch then get in
I swear these niggas talk tough but then they tucked off
Fuck a diss song this 16 come from the gun talk
Keep a glock 26 up in my true clothing
I lost my shooter in the shooting now I'm shooting for him
True story AJ will really shoot for me
Two Ks, no record labels it's really 2 on me
Say that chatter [?] ladder
I dont believe you nigga
Bleed East Oakland, so I'ma smoke you when I see you nigga
Never lacking, pistol packing and I only be with killers
Blow money and Mozzy with Philthy, nigga we the realest
We them niggas, so the fuck them niggas mad homie
Rockin' with this AR its like [?] n me
Shit if I aint got it on me, I stab homie
Ten bands on my name is more than that cash
