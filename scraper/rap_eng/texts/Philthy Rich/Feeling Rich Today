[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today
Yacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today
I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
Buy a pint, pour a six
I might just pimp out your bitch
100 thousand dollars, breaking tricks
Taking dates and doing back flips
I'm smoking zips, I ain't selling zips
All I do is sell sauce, I send a bitch to your house
Ding ding, right at your door
I'm with Mozzy and we pouring fours
I'm with Philthy and we in a Ghost
Invisible, I feel like a ghost
Sauce Twinz, yeah we do the most
It's the reason we got all the hoes
It's the reason we do all the shows
At 19 I was thirty toes
On this and that, really sending hoes
Hitting jewelry, buying rose gold
Now I buy it by the kilo
Rose gold, subzero
Kick a nigga's ass for the cash
Spill spill spill spill, split then dash
I worked hard to be a rich nigga
I prayed to god to be a rich nigga

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today
Yacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today
I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I'm feelin' richer than a bitch
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I'm feeling rich today
My bitches hit for 20K
Now they one week and one day
You broke hoes is just in the way
The Sauce Twinz was just in the Bay
We was just up in the Wraith
Salute to the nigga Mac Dre
I pimp on that ho like Mac Dre
I Fuck four hoes at one time
Never had four hoes at one time
Never had four hoes in your life
I'm sipping a cup of the slime
I tell that ho look here, she listen
One look from the ho and she missing
The roof on the foreigns, they missing
Your diamonds, they don't really glisten
Designer is on me, I'm dripping
The iron is on me, don't tempt me
Broke niggas mad so they dissing
But no I don't pay it no 'ttention
I got the bitch down on mission
I told the ho what is the mission?
She only call about chicken
The Jackson's, Grant's, and Benjamin's

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Jumpin' out with them broomsticks
Zoom in and they a youngin'
Decorate a nigga's residence
With that yellow tape and that stripe
It's all 50K in my bank, another 20 piece in these denims
The four Nicki so saucy, but I ain't leakin' shit when I drip 'em
Crack the seal and then spill it
Rich today how I'm feeling
Still sleeping, no squealing
It's rich killers and it's dealers
Word up to these hookers
Bet your bottom bitch that she choose
Got a von sway beyond ooze
That nigga Mozzy one of them dudes
You do what you want when you poppin'
Pull up to the lot and then drop it
Pull up and these bitches astonished
I fuck with the Twinz on my mama
My stoogie got nothing but chronic
I swear I'm the topic of gossip
They swear I'm The Plug cause I got it
Wires off and these Robins

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today

[Verse 4: Sancho Saucy]
I'm feeling rich today, might take your bitch today
Philthy Rich drippin' with me too
So you know what that pimpin' do
Five bullets on my fuckin' tooth
I'm breaking bitches, ain't that the truth
Can't tell me nothing cause I came from nothing
All a bitch can do is make me money
Pinky ring cost 30 onions
Damn Sancho, that's baby money
I'm big Sancho, boy I play with money
You don't ever conversate with money
I got killers waiting by my lawn
If I call 'em they gon' take you down
I got bitches out on they grind
Just in case I ever put this rapping down
