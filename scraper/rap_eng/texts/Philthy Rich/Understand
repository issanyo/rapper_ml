[Intro]
Zaytoven
Ayy it's Philthy nigga
You niggas couldn't imagine half the shit a nigga go through
That's why I go so hard on you niggas, look

[Chorus]
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)

[Verse 1]
Niggas I used to look up to look up to me (I used to)
I used to want to be like them, now they want to be like me (I used to)
Ain't no I in team, ain't no I in we (uh-uh)
All these foreigns in my garage I ain't drive in weeks (foreign)
Got a letter from my brother, guess he in the hole (ayy free JBay)
Put some money on his books so he can see the stove (solid)
Paid off my restitution, gave 'em what I owe (I did)
Finally got my passport so I can see the globe (it's Philthy)
Family members going against me tryna get a name (is that right?)
That's the price we pay for fame so I can't complain (uh-uh)
Your first baby daddy a snitch, the second one a lame (pussy)
Eight thousand on my wrist, that was loose change, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)

[Verse 2]
Flights out of town, she needed me around (she did)
But when I needed her the most, she was never found (she wasn't)
If you a queen baby you gotta hold your crown (gotta)
She couldn't hold it down if she was nailed to the ground (it's Philthy)
Hoes faggin' off, you wouldn't understand (bitch)
Sent a package off but it never land (ayy you get that?)
When niggas needed me I lent a helping hand (I did)
Them niggas changed on me so I won't help again (it's Philthy)
I stood on Sem and sold hella dope (swear to God)
But them niggas up the street had better coke (I can't lie)
Niggas broke in my house and stole hella clothes (is that right?)
Hella shoes and hella belts, them niggas hella broke, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)
All these diamonds on me, you won't understand (uh-uh nigga)
All designer on me, you won't understand (designer)
Bad bitch she on me, she don't got no man (bitch)
But all the shit I go through, she won't understand (it's Philthy)
