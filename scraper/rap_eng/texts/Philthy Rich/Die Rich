[Intro: Joe Blow]
This is Jay P Bangz
Check a real nigga out, though

[Verse 1: Joe Blow]
Been the realest in this rap shit the whole time
Coppin' Juice Maviani since '09
Same niggas say they love me probably won't slide
I think of Frost every time I pass 4-5
I did some snake shit, but been a rat? Never
Pharrell Human Races and my Jack sweater
Let's see who got the most money, fuck who rap better
It's young Blow, I been dope since the Crack Era
When me and Phil link, you better watch your bitch
Day-date on my wrist, what kind of watch you get?
'Stead of hatin' on P, you better knock a bitch
You niggas say you with the shit but I'm not convinced

[Chorus: Joe Blow]
When me and Phil link, you better watch your bitch
And I was born broke but I'ma die rich
Somebody call the lean man, I'm tryna buy a brick
Swear this killzone gelato got me high as shit
When I pull a street sweeper, shit, you can't run
Shit, I been a hundred plus since day one
I done did some shady shit so I can't judge
But cut some niggas off 'cause they was showin' fake love

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Gucci backpack hold an F&N (I keep it on me)
I don't need you niggas now, I ain't need you then (Uh-uh, nigga)
Just knocked a new ho, she from Santa Rosa (She is)
Had to get up out the kitchen, couldn't stand the odor (It's Philthy)
Stuffin' Backwoods full of killzone (Firin' up)
Pints of Hi-Tech with the seals on (Syrup)
New bitch look like India Love (Bitch)
Your nigga locked up, you couldn't send him a dub (It's Philthy)
Twenty thou', Robert Bayless on JBay appeal (Chump change)
Fake nigga, fake Rollie, can tell it ain't real (Pussy)
I believe in God so I don't pray in private (Swear to God)
Hibachi rice and lobster tail, rich nigga diet (Ayy, eat it up)

[Chorus: Joe Blow]
When me and Phil link, you better watch your bitch
And I was born broke but I'ma die rich
Somebody call the lean man, I'm tryna buy a brick
Swear this killzone gelato got me high as shit
When I pull a street sweeper, shit, you can't run
Shit, I been a hundred plus since day one
I done did some shady shit so I can't judge
But cut some niggas off 'cause they was showin' fake love
