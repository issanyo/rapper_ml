Look, 2006, I was broke when I came home
Couldn't afford a pack of Top Ramen or a thang loan (Uh-uh)
Bonnies on fours, down on the four (It was)
Now it's Miami on Collins, Lambo doors (It's Philthy, ho)
Bitch think she slick, money in her titty (Bitch)
Fired the bitch quick, screamin' free Smitty (ayy, free Smitty)
Obama freed Lil D from the Village (Six nine)
Stacey told on Tweets from Parchester Village (It's Philthy)
It's deeper than rap between me and you (You know that)
Slidin' between the opps block between three and two (Double back)
The hood wouldn't shed a tear if you died today (Seminary)
I was in the hood today sittin' on a Wraith (Swear to God)
Seminary, bitch, yeah the gang in here (Gang gang)
My nigga tagged the windshield while I banged the rear (Ayy, do that)
They said I had another nigga knocked off (Suckers)
While I was with your bitch playin' Top Golf (It's Philthy)
Been kicked the cup, but AD got the Sprite spiked (Syrup)
It won't be like me in the hood, they don't like Mike (Sem God)
My ex-bitch still got my name tatted (Is that right?)
She think about me every time he fuck her baby daddy (It's Philthy)
White track off, slidin' through Blackhawk (Slide)
Had a couple million in my account when she fagged off (Faggot)
I respect the nigga Blow for grabbin' the knife (Where mine?)
Nigga run up on me, I'ma stick his ass twice (It's Philthy)
That was your man but you ain't even slide for him yet (Slide)
Y'all from the same hood but you ain't ride for the set (Uh-uh)
I put on every nigga 'round me (I swear to God)
Who gon' take off in the end if they down me? (It's Philthy)
My San Jose ho still shop at Santana Row (She do)
Even when I'm takin' out the trash, I got the hammer, ho (Yeah, I keep it on me)
If that's your bitch, then she wasn't last night, nigga (Uh-uh)
I let her wash down the nut with the Sprite, nigga (It's Philthy)
They say I'm gettin' fat, they say I'm gettin' chubby (Is that right?)
Well since we talkin' facts, bitch, I'm gettin' money (Sem City Money Man)
â€‹iTunes checks fifty thou' a month (Chump change)
Killzone, five nine stuffed in the blunt (Gelato)
I think I might sign to 1017 (I think I might)
I had your bitch pregnant when I was 17 (Ayy, I think I did)
You beat a chick, you hang non-rich niggas (Broke nigga)
Couldn't imagine I'd run through six figures (I couldn't imagine)
Ten thou' a show, I'm booked every week (Swear to God)
Them fake niggas in the club, we don't care to speak (Uh-uh)
I got a bitch from North Vallejo with some good pussy (Bitch)
She say her baby daddy trippin' but he pussy (Pussy)
A well known booster but my sister introduced us (She did)
She steal anything from me, bitch, I'm gon' shoot you (Swear to God)
I'm 'bout to sell an i8, RIP X (Rest in peace X)
Too much fake love and I could be next, it's Philthy
