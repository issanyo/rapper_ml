[Hook: Philthy Rich (x2)]
You don't rock like you say you do (uh uh nigga)
You don't move like you posta to move (you don't move like us)
You don't move like you posta shoot (you ain't shoot shit)
Born black so we posta lose (s'Philthy)

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
That bitch Trey was on some square shit (is that right?)
That bitch Reesey was on some square shit (that bitch was)
That bitch Kendra was on some square shit (faggot)
But I cut them hoes off I wasn't on square shit (s'philthy nigga)
When I was on the block I was on some square shit (Seminary)
I was married to that bitch she gave me 36 (36)
That's more than any bitch ever done for me (huh?)
30 and a 40 if you coming for me (swear to god)
Yeah I fuck wit Mozzy that's a known fact (hey free Snubbs)
A lot of niggas tellin ain't seen the rat facts (ratatouille)
Keep my name out your black and white (ay do that for me)
You still a snitch in your afterlife (oh you is nigga)
Niggas in the hood bringing heat (young niggas)
I'm just tryna make sure the hood eat (I am)
It's FOD on my hoodie (it's FOD)
And Mozzy on my beanie (s'Philthy)

[Hook: Philthy Rich (x2)]

[Verse 2: E Mozzy]
They don't rock like they say they do
Bet he get to twitchin' when that k go loose
I'm in the game playing chess it's time to make a move
You don't ever move when you supposed to shoot
Streets don't want to see me win but I'ma never lose
Cause I'm focused on this prize tryna get the gouda
All this small talk you know I'm seeing right through it
My granny praying every night cause she don't wanna lose us
It's Mozzy over everything get with the movement
You'll get fucked up if you think this shit is just music
VBS and big moves got your bitch choosin'
Road running with them bags making two trips
All my bitches bagging and her bag is the blue chips
Everything new (?) exclusive no bullshit
20 out the trap make 30 out a boosie bitch
You can ask my mama 'bout that motherfuckin' (?)

[Hook: Philthy Rich (x2)]
You don't rock like you say you do (uh uh nigga)
You don't move like you posta to move (you don't move like us)
You don't move like you posta shoot (you ain't shoot shit)

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
It's hard to change when you changing for the better
They just gave my nigga double digits and a letter
Suicidal thoughts is what he stated in his letter
Lifetime commitment we in this shit forever
Sucka slid through why the fuck you niggas let him
I'm the type to stretch him out everytime I catch him
40 by the webbles, 4 finger pebbles
Raised in my granny house, black panther rebel
Cup full of slime, I'm throwing back yellows
Lil nigga messy murder scene, heavy metal
10 to 4, I'm really from the 4, so I'm a better man
Hell nah he ain't really from the 4 if I ain't met him
Product of the ghetto do anything for dinero
Wiley in my apparel, cater in the camero
I stay with the habanero
You know it's mandated
Cause ain't nobody fake man down he ain't make it nigga


[Hook: Philthy Rich (x2)]
You don't rock like you say you do (uh uh nigga)
You don't move like you posta to move (you don't move like us)
