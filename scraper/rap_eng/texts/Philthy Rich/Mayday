[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
Shit nigga
I guess they made number two, huh

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Bitch I'm from the Stinc Team, bleed team, ring ring, ding ding
Actin' like I ain't kick down your door in a mink thing
Ling ling, B thing, nigga it's a chink thing
Buddha 'round my neck because it means things, ching ching
Cold devil, ice chilly huh
Runnin' in these Christians, still lookin' like a million
Talkin' like he wanna rob me, nigga silly billies huh
He a stoner so I guess I gotta stone him
Or sniper his ass, I'm Eric Donor, I'm on it
Ugh, yeah ugh
Get shot in your face for thinkin' you Suge
We the new bullies, and you ain't seen the new boogers?
Should get chastised 'cause I'm a foolie nigga
I ain't no rookie, I'ma show you how to do this
Front door poppin', you see the two liter rollin' (shit nigga)

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay, another man down

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Pull up, park, bounce out
Nigga you drivin', you watch out
Keep the engine runnin', I'll be right out
If they send me to the county I'll be right out
If it ain't valuable you better leave it
Any false moves nigga, bet I leave it
For ten summers strong, runnin' my region
Hot boy, five hundred degrees, no fever
My niggas havin' things, yeah free Celly
Sixty inch flatscreen, I think he wanna sell it
A thick bitch from Inglewood at the roach telly
She got an eight of old Tech but she ain't tryna sell it
Fix some last money like rent eight
My bitch down on the track on a rainy day
I made a million dollars on some [?]
Black Mack got a brick, he 'bout to pour it up, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay
Pussy nigga mayday, man down, yell mayday
This F&N hold Shanaynay, another man down
