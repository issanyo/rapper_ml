[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Spent two-hundred last month, nigga (I did!)
Young rich nigga
Coped a Maserati and a new Audi
Threw Forgi's on for my bitch, nigga
Got the Breitling on, it's my play watch
A few hundred thou in my safe box
Nigga, disrespect me and I'll bounce out
And let a hundred rounds from that K drop
Thirty-thousand [?]
Miami nice we on [?]
Twenty thousand that live, nigga
Rose bottles, no bitch niggas
Vamp life, no chain snatched
Fuck around get your brain snatched
This niggas don't love your flow
Until you make the evening news
Real nigga, now I'm outside
Ain't worried 'bout a homicide
My nigga's bout trigger-play
Anytime of the fuckin' day
In my hood you gotta catch a body
If you ever wanna be somebody
Nigga, you just a nobody
Nah, you ain't never caught a body

[Hook: Jim Jones]
These niggas is pussies nowadays (they been pussy's)
These niggas don't push me or I'll spray (don't push me)
These niggas is barking they don't bite (these faggot niggas)
My niggas is ballin' that's on sight (on sight, nigga)
My niggas is ballin' that's on sight (on sight, nigga)
My niggas is ballin' that's on sight (on sight, nigga)
My niggas is ballin' that's on sight (on sight, nigga)
These niggas is barking they don't bite
