[Chorus: G Perico]
What you say, what you say, what you say, now?
Don't hate, don't hate, don't hate, now
Get away, get away, get away, now
I'm puttin' somethin' in the safe every God damn day now

[Verse 1: G Perico]
Really ain't got time to waste
It ain't enough time in the day
You cool stayin' with your mom, mom moved away
Fuck this BMW, I want a Wraith
Tales from a Crip nigga, never mind my habits
What I want I gotta have it
Money fiend, pussy fiend
Even though I'm off the East side I still like nice things
Vroom, vroom, the car, I dog it
Old school, I just had to go smog it
Remember me on 103rd sellin' dope
With the deaf nigga at the door watchin' po-po?
They ain't come, so a nigga had a good run
Passed down million dollar game and you ain't do nothin'
Passed down million dollar game and you still broke
Let you hold somethin'? Gotta be a joke

[Chorus: G Perico]
What you say, what you say, what you say, now?
Don't hate, don't hate, don't hate, now
Get away, get away, get away, now
I'm puttin' somethin' in the safe every God damn day now
(It's Philthy, nigga, uh-huh, look)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Safe weigh a ton, bolted to the floor (It do)
Them havin'-thangs niggas, they be kickin' doors
Somethin' in the Rolly got the crib face (Bust that)
Couple hundred thousand I done misplaced (I have)
I can't miss shit that I never had (Nuh-uh)
Two-eleven on the intercom dispatch (5-0)
East side Oakland, east side South Central (Seminary)
Baby D just scored for a Presidential (It's Philthy)
Bitch say she never seen stars in a Wraith (That right?)
Ain't nowhere to park, too many foreigns in the way (Foreigns)
Hair to the side, Double R thottie pic (Thottie pic)
If she take one of them, you done lost the bitch (It's Philthy, ho)
I carry each stone in a big brace (Each one)
They done discontinued the 41 big face (Day-to-day)
Bad bitch with me, live in Calabas (Bad bitch)
Couple hundred in the bank, a couple in the mattress, it's Philthy

[Chorus: G Perico]
What you say, what you say, what you say, now?
Don't hate, don't hate, don't hate, now
Get away, get away, get away, now
I'm puttin' somethin' in the safe every God damn day now
