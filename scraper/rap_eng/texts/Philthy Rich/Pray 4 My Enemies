[Intro: Philthy Rich]
Ayy it's Philthy nigga
Pray for my enemies
You know attention is like money
Everybody want some, uh-huh
Look, look, look, look

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, bosses don't engage in the small talk
See when it's beef it's no peace, you can't call it off
Couple killers waiting on that phone call
Ten thousand four ways, they'll knock you off
Gotta couple Rollies I can pass around
Graduated from the streets, no cap and gown (Seminary)
Once you drop your nuts it's no backin' down
Hi-Tech in my cup, it's no Act in town
They took the elevator while I took the stairs
Payless on my feet, yeah I took the stares
Now it's red bottoms, every day a different pair
Three thousand on these shoes I'll probably never wear, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back

[Verse 2: Lil Pete]
Reminiscing, miss my niggas, how it used to be
If you don't know me by now you gon' get used to me
He told on the gang then you ain't fuckin' with him
But if he told on the opps you still fuckin' with him
Comin' from the struggle, bitch it's different levels
We up now and I ain't even have to push the pedal
If they ain't talkin' 'bout them M's I ain't tryna settle
The streets cold so you know we gotta keep the metal
My cousin still thuggin' on the stay away
Sucker hit, I know he prayin' for another day
Couple seen but you know I take 'em to the grave
She just gave me twenty bands, she ain't seen my face

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back

[Verse 3: Prezi]
I remember them broke days, I swear the nights was long
Them suckers see that I'm on and now they mad I'm home
I was taught to protect my brothers but they say I'm wrong
When I was strugglin' by myself nobody put me on
Touched ten bands from two shows, that was out of town
Checkin' chicken from two hoes that be out of town
Most these niggas playin' roles, I guess they actors now
My niggas apply the pressure, ain't no backing down
Interrogation, facing life, I still ain't say a thing
I prayed they kept it in the streets but niggas said my name
Gettin' money and groupie bitches isn't fascinating
I'm doin' better, bitch it's Prezi, no assassination

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back
Pray for my enemies, I know them niggas mad
Runnin' off at the mouth or running up a bag
I just thank the lord when I count the cash
I remember I was poor, I'm never going back
