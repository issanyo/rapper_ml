[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I say my mama always told me, mama always told me
Pops wasn't around me, so mama always showed me
Rest in peace to Doe B, I remember having no heat
But money for the OE, one bedroom four deep
Baby girl struggled with me, I come from the struggle really
I used to really hustle Whitney, you can see the hustle in me
Mama couldn't fend for me and granny couldn't send for me
They could just pray for me, please wash my sins for me
Kicked out at a young age, I was on a rampage
I was tryna get paid, didn't think 'bout a damn stage
This way before rap, I used to weigh crack
Locked up building four MACs, sleeping on foam mats
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene

[Verse 2: Lil Daddy CBM]
Mama said fuck the streets, she ain't with it
Boy it's a million ways to go get it
Fuck a job, hit the block, sell a midget
Stepdaddy had a sack, I had to steal it
'Fore you get down, boy you better listen
Better think twice, better pay attention
In the kitchen water whippin' with the fishes
Nigga I ain't doin' no dishes
Straight drop jumpin' out the bowl
Got junkies beatin' down the door
Niggas ain't catchin' them plays
Niggas ain't breakin' no doors
Niggas ain't sellin' no bows
Niggas ain't whippin' on the stove
Niggas just tellin' them lies
Actin' like we don't know
Mama tried to keep me out the street
But you know she still kept it G
Taught a nigga how to run gin
So a nigga came runnin' on me
Cinco roll up the dope
You already know what we smoke
Take a flight to the West Coast
Philthy got a bag for the low

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene

[Verse 3: Mista Cain]
Don't live off trust, don't live off love
That's what mama always told me
Every day my mama prayed, lord mama always hold me
Fifty thousand on a Rollie, was livin' wild now I'm focused
Head in the clouds, that potent
Just blew an L for Big Pokie
Actavis, slow motion
Arrogant, unnoticed
Gettin' bent behind window tints
Fill grocery bags, no groceries
In a coupe thing just floating
On the interstate just coasting
My boo thang just bought a new bag
And I filled it up with them OZs
Hold it, they doubted that I would get noticed
My mama told me just stay focused
And fuck all that wishing and hoping
I'm hoping they do not provoke me
And they are not who they claim to be
A chain ain't shit but a chain to me
Street nigga, ain't no changing me, Lil Cain

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene

[Verse 4: Johnny Cinco]
Mama taught a nigga how to hustle
Mama always had to fuckin' hustle
Mama taught me how to hide the struggle
Go get some money, it gon' add up for us
Mama showed me how to fit a duffle
How to spend that block on all them legos
How to spend that block on pussy niggas
How to spend that block on pussy niggas

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
Mama always told me MOB
Mama always told me live your dream
Mama always told me go extreme
Go get your money, stay clear of the scene
