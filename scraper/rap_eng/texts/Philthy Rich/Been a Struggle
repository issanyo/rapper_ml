[Chorus: Prezi]
If money talk, it ain't nothin’ to have a conversation
If this the life that you live then why you contemplatin'?
If you ain't built for this game you better stand down
Long nights and hard times but I’m the man now
It's been a struggle but tell them people it's gettin' lovely
I done did a bunch of shit but who are you to judge me?
I can get it on my own, you ain't gotta plug me
Give a fuck 'bout what you think long as my people love me

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Uh-huh, look
My brother told my mama that he want me dead (Is that right?)
But I'ma pray for him, he probably off his meds (Amen)
Just add him to the list, this shit is pitiful (ayy do that)
Hit my sister, my daddy won't view my funeral (It’s Philthy nigga)
We share the same blood but we ain’t related (Uh-huh)
Oakland PD say I'm gang related (Seminary)
No interviews, no press about you (No press about you)
I ain’t losin' no sleep, I ain't depressed about you (Philthy)
Sippin' all this syrup out this Ac’-y bottle (Syrup)
Ahk shit, pop shit, free that nigga Ralo (Ayy free that nigga Ralo)
I bust down the block before I bust a watch (Swear to God)
The feds up the street tryna watch the block (Five-oh)
Bitch say she love me but fuckin' my nigga (Bitch)
I guess it's payback for fuckin' her sister (I guess so)
Nah I ain't perfect but I am loyal (Solid)
Out on bail right now, I'm 'bout to see a lawyer, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Prezi]
If money talk, it ain't nothin' to have a conversation
If this the life that you live then why you contemplatin'?
If you ain't built for this game you better stand down
Long nights and hard times but I'm the man now
It's been a struggle but tell them people it's gettin' lovely
I done did a bunch of shit but who are you to judge me?
I can get it on my own, you ain't gotta plug me
Give a fuck 'bout what you think long as my people love me

[Verse 2: Prezi]
Give a fuck 'bout what you think, I'm my own man
I don't play with lil' kids, I'm a grown man
Since I jumped off that porch, had to keep a torch
Either hoopin' or you shootin' had to pick a sport
They givin' false information, careful with your source
My decisions been by choice, they ain't come by force
A bunch of blessings I receive, I gotta thank the Lord
A couple of shooters on my side when it's time to perform
Been got up out my ways of a broke nigga
I can't deal with broke bitches, I need a go-getter
Might as well kill yourself if you got funk with us
Stop talkin' 'bout doin' shit that you won't nigga
Sac love me, Oakland love me, shout out San Jo'
No security, what you think I brought my mans for?
Shout out Ohio, Seattle, Portland be fuckin' with me
Denver, LA, Atlanta, shout out to Killer City

[Chorus: Prezi]
If money talk, it ain't nothin' to have a conversation
If this the life that you live then why you contemplatin'?
If you ain't built for this game you better stand down
Long nights and hard times but I'm the man now
It's been a struggle but tell them people it's gettin' lovely
I done did a bunch of shit but who are you to judge me?
I can get it on my own, you ain't gotta plug me
Give a fuck 'bout what you think long as my people love me
