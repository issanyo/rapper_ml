[Chorus: 211]
Two seater, trynna get 'em both to go with me
Presidential Rollie, tell them bitches "vote for me"
Champagne-in', campaign-in' she all over me
On the set, wait 'til she get a load of me (load of me)
Load of me, bitches get a load of me
Get a load of me, bitches get a load of me
Presidential Rollie, tell them bitches "vote for me"
On the set, wait 'til she get a load of me (load of me)

[Verse 1: 211]
Get a load of me, g-g-get a load of me
Yellow gold rosary my earring cost a quarter key
Quarter pound roll with me, she just wanna roll with me
Hit a couple times now she actin' like she go with me
Throw her in, throw a DUECE, oh that's just my side hoe
Thirty bands for that time piece, so that fuck shit I got no time fo' (nahhh)
A7 the Audi, hit the gas and I'm outtie (gone!)
All hunnits I'm countin' if it's no limits I'm 'bout it
Full clip and I'm loaded, drunk as fuck and she rollin'
Presidential that Rollie, I'm campaignin' she votin'
Ronald Reagan I'm that dope
JFK with my top back
I’m gettin' money, I’m fuckin' hoes
I fucks 'er hard and she like that

[Verse 2: Philthy]
I say now broke bitch get a load of me
This Maserati, make 'em notice me
This white ice in my rosary and I’m True'd up like I’m 'posed to be
My young nigga – he locked up
He just called her a 2-11
Sin City to Inglewood, shouts out my nigga 2Eleven
Just slide through, I’m in the hood
That’s one place he can’t be
He talk about it but ain’t about it
Just pull up and you will see
A real nigga since day one, fake nigga I ain’t one
Sin City where the heat from
I knock em down with that kick drum
You better get yo money up
These rap niggas don’t wanna beef
I supply the funds, I supply these guns
Then have these niggas turn up the heat
Them other niggas just animated, these bad hoes infatuated
I tell that bitch to get a load of me then pass back my Jordan nigga
It’s Philthy

[Verse 3: Ice Burgandy]
I'm what you call a line, I'm a pills person
Got my own line, secret service
Do my damn thang, campaign
She don't see me buy barrels in bank page
Red bone, got a red bottom
Four hundred dollars got me in Prada
'Nother hundred dollars [?]
Tell them bitches they better vote for me
She my girl, you trynna hold for me?
[?]...wasn't in the kitchen bitch you know it's me
I'm filthy rich, I'm a LiveWire
Sharp as fuck, barbed wire
Pull up in that same two seater, you got [?] bitch [?]
I bet them bitches notice me, I got four bitches trynna roll with me
I keep that shit ganstga and bitches on me like they supposed to be
I paid 50 pounds of [?] for the new Rollie
Ice down to the crown I call it Midget Mollie
