[Intro]
It's Bladadah Gang! (this beats is so sick bitch)
One up top fru'my thang nigga
Yeah
Mafioso nigga MOZZY!

[Hook: Mozzy]
I tell the truth
I aired them suckas out and had they units spooked
I swear a popped a sucka first time i bought a tool
We can pistol play but that ain't something you want to do
I'm just being honest
Lav never caught a body, I'm just being honest
They say Jakee died and we popped him I'm just being honest
Like 20,000 on Mozzy I'm just being honest
So I ride around with this wallie I'm just being honest
Lav never caught a body, I'm just being honest
They say Jakee died and we popped him I'm just being honest
Like 20,000 on Mozzy I'm just being honest, (yo, nigga) so I ride around with this wallie I'm just being honest

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Blah-
Blah-
Like 20,000 on my True Religion
You hit the cell and turned 2 pidgeons
House niggas like a hunnid' of'em
You pussy niggas never runnin' nothin'
I'm front line never run, I'm bustin'
If your backs turned  my MAC work
Slide up on you on 35th I give a nigga a whole thirty clip
Them pussy niggas they take talk about me
But my young niggas'll leave chalk around them
I'm a QB on my block touch this QB and I'm gone pop
I told y'all fuck 5-7 every time I slide they call 9-11 (po-lice)
Motel 6 I fill clips, nigga no F that's yo set
Is that your wife on backpage?
My young niggas they clap Ks
You ain't even no burglar nigga
You ain't never caught no murder nigga
Knock 'em down might chop 'em down
Hundred rounds through his fake Polos
Bounce out on my solo
Got that MAC blast on my whole load

[Hook: Mozzy]
I tell the truth
I aired them suckas out and had they units spooked
I swear a popped a sucka first time i bought a tool
We can pistol play but that ain't something you want to do
I'm just being honest
Lav never caught a body, I'm just being honest
They say Jakee died and we popped him I'm just being honest
Like 20,000 on Mozzy I'm just being honest
So I ride around with this wallie I'm just being honest
Lav never caught a body, I'm just being honest
They say Jakee died and we popped him I'm just being honest
Like 20,000 on Mozzy I'm just being honest, (yo, nigga) so I ride around with this wallie I'm just being honest

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Slither through on that one-shit with that drumstick and  my young nigga
Same one that popped Jakee, and that [?] goin' slump nigga
Y'all know where I'm from nigga
Word up to my gun niggas
Killed bruh went to the hood he punched on tryna run nigga
1-9er like 4-fingers, fuck with blow and them [?]
Dre best stay in due places finna line him up for that new [?]
Lil Monty said he goin' visit Jake with that blam-jam and I laiseed him
Swear to god you'd better thank 'em, cause my 4th nigga tryna spank 'em
Y'all niggas ain't yankin' (Amen!) who the last nigga you smoke?
It's one up top in that throat
Tryna' knock off your top with this smoke
Cross-sighted-ass bitch nigga tryna' slide through with his folks
But ain't hit shit but them brick walls and that plywood on them homes
You hella hard on that internet like you hella hard in them songs
I ain't hard to find I'll be in the hood, you go hella far when it's funk
Nigga that's the shit you don't want
It's pistol play with these pipes
And these trigga niggas ain't no threat and I'd I could put that shit on my life

[Hook: Mozzy]
I tell the truth
I aired them suckas out and had they units spooked

Like 20,000 on Mozzy I'm just being honest
