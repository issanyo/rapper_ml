[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]
They say I'm actin' different, no I'm stackin' different
Free my nigga Chic', he was young and scandalous with it
I move swift 'cause the feds tryna shackle niggas
They'll let 'em touch down just to tackle niggas
I'm 'bout pushin' forward, never bending backwards nigga
If life a book, this the level up chapter nigga
More money, bigger ice, smaller circles
Just some loyal niggas and some killers that'll merk you
If you hustle hard, ice your wrist, you deserve to
Tell them begging niggas that's complaining you should earn too
Didn't know how to mix blow, but I learned to
Then my little stacks, you should've seen what it turned to
Most nigga had handouts, I had to cash out
When I copped to move forward on my cash route
But it all paid off in the end
When they ship sunk, I was good, I knew how to swim

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy & Philthy Rich]
We got the same twenty-four hours in the day (it's Philthy nigga)
Stop wasting time, nigga get paid (ayy do that)
Got a dime on me that I just made (I do)
Got a dime on me that I just made

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Meek told me to these rap niggas I'm a threat (he did)
See they don't want to let me in but bitch I'm up next (it's Philthy ho)
These niggas all bitches, no Cotex (pussy)
My bitch hangin' up minks, no coat checks (designer)
See we be jumpin' off flights so we can catch the fight (huh?)
Ten thousand for these seats to watch Floyd tonight (Money Team)
These all VS1's, them moissanites (bust down)
Tell that nigga tag his jeweler so we know it's ice (Philthy)
Ayy yeah I fuck with the D, that's a known fact (what up though)
Nigga stop gettin' fronted, get your own pack (ayy do that)
This grown man money, got my own sack (the money man)
Nigga never keep the work where your home at (uh-uh)
That broke shit you talkin', I ain't on that (broke nigga)
That foreign that he drivin', he don't own that (foreign)
They said that his big homie loaned that (is that right?)
I'm just happy that we got Dame and Mone back, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
We got the same twenty-four hours in the day (same twenty-four)
Stop wasting time, nigga get paid (get on it)
Got a dime on me that I just made (ten thousand)
Got a dime on me that I just made

[Verse 3: Team Eastside Peezy]
Ayy, I ain't fall off, bitch I fell back (bitch I fell back)
I ain't graduate, I had to sell crack (workin')
Pullin' off the dealership in Hellcats (vroom)
Nigga play with me and get his head cracked (far)
Eastside bitch, we grind in black Dickie fits (all winter)
From underdog to top dog, I know these niggas pissed (niggas hurt)
Rap niggas talkin' shit that they ain't really did (lyin')
How you sellin' bricks but you ain't got nowhere to live (that's crazy)
Blow a bag when I feel 'cause I been savin' (stackin')
I don't listen to these niggas 'cause they been hatin' (pussy nigga)
You see this chain around my neck, this bitch hittin' ain't it (shinin')
Nigga get up out your feelings and go get some paper

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
We got the same twenty-four hours in the day (same twenty-four)
Stop wasting time, nigga get paid (get on it)
Got a dime on me that I just made (ten thousand)
Got a dime on me that I just made
We got the same twenty-four hours in the day (get on your hustle)
Stop wasting time, nigga get paid (playin')
Got a dime on me that I just made (ten ball)
Got a dime on me that I just made (yup, yeah)

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
I just hit for twenty K in all blues
Killers in the venue when we fall through
I'm just tryna see what baby jaw do
Double cup styrofoam full of dog food
Show up with my shooters, making sure we straight
That backend is mandatory, think he owe me eight
All these damn grams make the donkey break
Bust it down, poppin' pimples in the Rollie face
Crucify the jeweler if the Rollie fake
Foreign filthy, pulled up on me in that holy Wraith
Your block ain't activated 'less your corner shake
Tuckin' spitters in my jaw, nigga stomach ache
You run the play and run it back, that's how you run it up
Cut the back off the Caddy, we came to fuck it up
I'm in the back of my neighbors, they tryna cut for somethin'
Mama please do me this favor and put the sonnet up
