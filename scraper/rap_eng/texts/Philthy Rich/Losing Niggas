[Intro: Philthy Rich]
Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga
Huh
Free all my niggas
Sem City, Harbor Road shit
Tired of losing niggas to the system

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)
Losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)

[Verse 1: Prezi]
From the struggle and I made it, got me feelin' lovely (Lovely)
I'm that nigga in my section, and my hood love me (They love me)
Bunch of bitches in my DMs, tell 'em pay a fee (Pay a fee)
They wanna fuck with Team Prezi, now they play for me (Uh huh)
I take this street shit serious, niggas playin' for keeps
They killed Higgs, goddamnn, I ain't slept in weeks
Got me watchin' everything because I'm paranoid
And my pockets gettin' bulgy, no steroids (Steroids)
I know a couple niggas told, that shit hurt my soul
The game cold, when you see real niggas fold (Uh huh)
Keep a pole on my person 'cause it's mandatory (Mandatory)
Playin' like he lost my hammer, I ain't fallin' for it (I ain't fallin' for it)

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)
Losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, really come from the hood that I claim, nigga (Seminary)
How it feel to have that jacket on your name, nigga? (How it feel, nigga?)
Them statements that you gave, you can't change, nigga (Never)
I read the paperwork with your name, nigga (Philth)
They said my young nigga double backed on me
How I'm supposed to watch his mama cry if I smack homie? (Can't do that)
The streets don't come with no benefits
He just started gettin' money, but he's been a snitch (Pussy)
Free that nigga Smitty, free J-Bay (Ayy, free J-Bay)
I think about 'em when I'm starin' at this day, day (Swear to God)
Ayy, fuck my enemies and whoever ridin' with 'em (Suckas)
If we ain't got the same enemies, then you ain't my nigga

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)
Losin' niggas to the system and I really miss 'em (Ayy, I really miss 'em)
Louboutins on my feet, I've been rockin' Christian ('Tins)
Had to cut them niggas off because I heard they snitchin' (I had to)
Really come from the slums, ain't have a pot to piss in  (Philth)
