Oh, I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Oh oh, I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy nigga)

Peep me out look
I remember that day, shit'll never change
You was my nigga', should've never changed
Shit is all the same, nigga's die, momma's cry
Bitches turn sour now she fucking on that other guy
Fucking with that other side
Man I miss my nigga's
I ain't talking rap nigga's, man I miss my nigga's
Free Dame, free Wayne, free Derwin too
Free Bot, free Low, free Mo too
Mall took 18, Hyphe took 22, Real took a half of hundred
Something that I couldn't stomach
Tae just got locked up, D waiting on an appeal
Real ran in a bank, man life is so real
Mane just came home, but he back on the run
Somebody snitching on him told them where to find the gun
Thinking to myself, as I wrote this song
Most of my nigga's from my hood either dead or gone (It's Philthy)

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy, peep me out)

No block on my phone
My nigga's call straight through
Run up off at the mouth I'll have my nigga's scrape you
Nothing to live for, my nigga's doing life sentences
Either dead or in jail we doing life sentences
Rest in peace Dre Feddi, rest in peace Tee Woods
Rest in peace C and M until we fucking meet again
Free my nigga Chris the Fifth, free my nigga Chris Lokket
Real nigga's going to sleep is not a fucking option
It's a real nigga' behind this fucking ice
So keep it solid while you here, you don't live twice
Hold your head all my nigga's on the top tier
And pour some liquor for my nigga's that is not here
Rest in peace shirts, a lot of sad faces
A lot of snitch nigga's caught real nigga's cases
There ain't no day that go by that I don't think about you
Middle finger to the ones that don't think about you (It's Philthy)

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Fuck what you're going through (It's Philthy nigga', I do this for y'all)

Nigga's don't understand to lose they right hand man
They go crazy in the head, rest in peace Lil Rege
I was raised by the streets, I wasn't raised by my parents
So being a real street nigga' could never be a challenge
Moms had 5 kids, 5 different baby daddies
Raised by the OG's I never had a fucking daddy
No I never needed one, I'm a father to my son
He don't even know my son
See this life hard, don't get it twisted though
I been a real nigga', since a snotty nose
5-0 killed Joddy, but they don't talk about it
I guess 'cause he was a felon, they don't talk about it
I miss my nigga's everyday no I can't lie
Even though I'm riding fly nigga' still cry
I miss my nigga's everyday no I can't lie
Even though I'm riding fly nigga' still cry (It's Philthy)

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Fuck what you're going through

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
