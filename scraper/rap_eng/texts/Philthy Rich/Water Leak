[Hook : Offset]
Bust down, all gold Philipe
Bentley with the red velvet seats yeah
Stars in the ceiling go to sleep
Bricks on the water got them wrapped up in the reef
I don't wanna talk I let the money do a speech
Yeah, the diamonds cost a lot but get the FN for free
A potato with the Draco, shootin' out the backseat
Drippin' everywhere my diamonds got a water leak

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
That bitch looks at my chain, she said 'boy, that shit so rocky'
Aye, boy I know 'bout you
Your new bitch my old option, yea
Got my shooters with me, only got one hoe 'round me

The labels talkin' 'bout they got a million dollar check
The last time I checked a couple million on my neck
So, tell 'em call back I can't sign for nothing less
The first nigga you seen with the rose gold Patek
Pourin' up the lean glass bottle with a TEC
Free JW, yeah shout out to the Jets
Pull up in the Wraith, I used to pull up in the Lex'
Flexin' with my new bitch, she stuntin' on my ex
Stones lookin' cuban but need a diamond test

[Verse 3: Sauce Walka]
300 thousand on jewelry, boy this not new to me
Cut all the foolery
I been the king of ballin' and the coonery
I touched a quarter million way before I was 23
Niggas rappin' 'bout life like a eulogy
It ain't my faulty these niggas ain't blewed as me
All this flavor I'm drippin' influencin'
Bitches pay to drink my nut, now I'm the smoothie king
I'm the lord of the South like they movie Ring
I'm the lord of these hoes just like Jesus is
I make bitches want chocolate like Reeseâ€™s did
Diamonds is so hard, I can't see where my piece is
I own so many houses, just might lease a crib
I might throw some diamonds on my baby bib
Or a pacifier, I'm the sauce messiah
Nigga tell you different he a fucking liar
