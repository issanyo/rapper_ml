[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm a star, look at my wrist
Eleven eleven, she just wanna make a wish
All this water 'round my neck, it make me drown
All this money keep these bad bitches around
I just wanted to be rich
I came from nothing, I was stackin' in my nicks
Now these niggas come up to me like we rounds
Guess all this money keep these fake niggas around

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I said with Guwop in a new drop
Shirt off like 2Pac
From Seminary, nigga you not
In the kitchen breakin' in the new pots
On papers but I still keep that hammer on me
I'm the shit in East Oakland bitch, ask about me, look
EA, nigga EO, Anti like T.O
Rollie on, got three more
Dirty piss for my PO
You a bird bitch, you a bird bitch
Thirty on me, Stephen Curry bitch
I was steppin' on the work bitch
When you was steppin' into work bitch
These red bottoms cost three thou
Make a bitch walk three miles
My ex bitch wanna reach out
To a broke bitch, I play senile
It's F.O.D, 1017
Seen ten bricks when I was seventeen
Dirty sprite mixed with the lean
Bust down Rollie but the diamonds clean

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm a star, look at my wrist
Eleven eleven, she just wanna make a wish
All this water 'round my neck, it make me drown
All this money keep these bad bitches around
I just wanted to be rich
I came from nothing, I was stackin' in my nicks
Now these niggas come up to me like we rounds
Guess all this money keep these fake niggas around

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I walked out the fed gate, I shed all the dead weight
I just shut Coachella down then I flew into the bay
Man this track sound so familiar, man it's Gucci Mane and Zay
And Philthy Rich, if you ain't tryna get rich you in the way
Matter fact I hit the lot and bought me five more Bentleys
Three tennis chains on but I don't play tennis
Two bad bitches with me nigga, mind your fuckin' business
All the chickens that I sold, I could've got a life sentence
I'm grinning 'cause I'm winning, put myself in this position
It's hard not to smile when you just made twenty million
This might be a hit Philthy, damn that sprite look real filthy
All these diamonds on me, ain't no way I could plead not guilty

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I'm a star, look at my wrist
Eleven eleven, she just wanna make a wish
All this water 'round my neck, it make me drown
All this money keep these bad bitches around
I just wanted to be rich
I came from nothing, I was stackin' in my nicks
Now these niggas come up to me like we rounds
Guess all this money keep these fake niggas around
