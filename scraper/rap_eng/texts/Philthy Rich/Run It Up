[Intro]
Triple M on the beat

[Chorus: BOE Sosa & Philthy Rich]
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins (Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga)
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him (Uh-huh)
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, nothin' like the lames, you should be ashamed (Bitch)
Once you fuck that broke nigga, it never be the same (Uh-uh)
Step your game up and stop fuckin' your name up (Ayy do that)
I just knocked your bottom bitch up in this Range truck (It's Philth)
Bitch fagged off and came back with 30K (Chump change)
Told her she can't get no dick for like 30 days (Faggot)
2012, nigga, I was 12 deep (Swear to God)
A dollar a day for 10 days, 120 G's (It's Philth)
Five bedroom house up at Rose Rents (Is that right?)
White bitch checkin' traps at the Bunny Ranch (Silence)
Every pimp in the game got respect for me (Salute)
Your bitch hit my DM, got a check for me (She do)
I don't serve niggas, 'less you servin' an eight deep (Hello)
That bitch pillow talkin', that's your BFE (No BFE)
She left him to come choose in a hurry (Ayy, run it up)
You can have your chain back, I don't wear fake jewelry (Fu)
It's Philthy

[Chorus: BOE Sosa & Prezi]
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip (It's Prezi)

[Verse 2: Prezi]
Your last nigga, he was broke, baby, he ain't in my bracket
My thick, light-skin bitch, she got a different accent
I'm built for this game and I ain't even practice
Helped my nigga bust a play and I ain't even tax it
When you come where I'm from, you got the odds against you
Everybody ain't your people, watch who you tend to
They want my lifestyle, but it's a lot with this shit
He ripped up all her clothes when he got knocked for his bitch
I'm a different breed
I'm 'bout a bag, you 'bout a bitch, we got different needs
I don't cuff no bitch, I let these bitches leave
And I'm a breath of fresh air, let these bitches breathe, huh
Bustin' plays on the road, nigga
But the game is to be sold, not to be told, nigga
Bitch, I'm with my brothers, I don't do the friends
She get them Benjamins, she gon' run it in
And that's a fact, nigga

[Chorus: BOE Sosa & Pooh Hefner]
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him (Uh-huh)
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip (Hef, nigga)

[Verse 3: Pooh Hefner]
Nigga I don't want the ho if she don't come with a payment
And I don't chase the bitch unless her last name Franklin
Niggas want me gone 'cause I'm rich and I'm famous
She say she wanna choose, now she speakin' my language
He a lame ass nigga, he be jaws in the shit
But that ain't what I said, that's what came from her lips
But I'm first class Hef, never believe in the bitch
So when a bitch hand off, I just be makin' it flip
Real nigga out the rich, I just play my position
And I don't entertain when she demandin' attention
Everything that bitch do, she gotta ask for permission
Forgis on the whip, fuckin' up the suspension
Before the ho ask, I let her know that it's pimpin'
So stay far away if you ain't feelin' this 'ism
'Cause I do this year 'round, all 365
And I do it from the wrist, the SF to 59, Hef

[Chorus: BOE Sosa]
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip
She gon' run it up, she gon' run it in
I'm just a young nigga tryna stack my Benjamins
She just left her man, don't wanna be with him
He a lame nigga, he can't make the money flip
