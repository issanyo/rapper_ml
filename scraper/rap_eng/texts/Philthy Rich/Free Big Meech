[Verse 1: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Make your bitch scream my neighborhood, huh
I'm on 59th, nigga, I'm in Phil hood, huh
I'ma fuck the lil' bitch on the Wraith hood, huh
I'ma buy the whole batch if them pills good, ayy, ayy
I ain't no nigga you can press, huh, huh
Fuck around, catch two in the chest, huh, ayy
I ain't that nigga you can check, huh, huh
Boy, you better have the vest, hold on, hold on
Bitch, I need the check, I don't really want the sex
If that pussy ain't wet, I'm tryna slide in the Vette
Sold five ninety packs, plug said he impressed, huh
I'm lookin' for an Asian nigga, lookin' for a Mex, hold on
Lookin' for an Asian ho, I heard they the best
I just fired my lil' ghetto ho, that broke bitch a mess
I just put twenty packs on the shh, they compress, huh
Watch I make twenty turn to thirty, make it stretch, huh
I'ma cook it with the left arm, the right need a rest
Need to put your right hand on, that nigga need some help
Hoo, young nigga, I just cleared two checks, hold on
I just bought a lot of work, I ain't even get fresh, hold on
