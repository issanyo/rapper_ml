[Intro]
It's just some shit I never understood about a person
Why the fuck you wanna name yourself after somethin' fake
Somethin' plastic, somethin' not real (and we get wavy in this mothafucka)
Huh? Shit don't make no sense to me
That’s like callin' yourself a thousand-dollar bill, it ain't real

[Chorus]
Look, why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense
To me it don't make no sense
Why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense (ayy, look)
To me it don't make no sense (look)

[Verse 1]
Nightclubs (nightclubs) and designer drugs (zums)
Searchin' in the wrong place for all kind of love (she is)
Got pregnant on me once wit' the weed man (I remember that)
Said she'd never do it again and I believed that (it's Philthy y'all)
Introduced her to the finest, used to be a bum (she used to)
Tried to live above her means but didn't have enough (broke bitch)
I guess she pop them zanies so she don't feel the pain (I guess so)
No appetite so she losin' weight (she is)
Bad boob job, she on her second one (is that right?)
She totaled both her cars, she can't drive for nothin' (no insurance)
A pure fuck up if you askin' me (if you askin' me)
But she think she a diva up in fashion week (she think so)
She lies to herself so much she start to believe her lies (huh)
The bitch vision blurry, she can't believe her eyes (Ray Charles)
But behind closed doors, she'll snort a mile (she will)
But behind closed doors the bitch in denial (it's Philthy)

[Chorus]
Why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense
To me it don't make no sense
Why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense
Ayy it's Philthy nigga, look
To me it don't make no sense

[Verse 2]
Jeopardize what we had (huh), never bringin' up ya past (never)
Fell asleep behind the wheel, airbags and broken glass (bitch)
You lied to my face (ya did), for a whole week straight (did)
Then ya crashed ya patna car (did)
See how karma play? (it's Philthy)
CPS is where I stay (they is)
Got the rolla's where I lay (do)
'Cause you told 'em everything
And now you mad you gotta shake? (get up outta here)
Just happy they okay (I am), every boata walk away
Facetime from the scene, I’m just happy they was straight (hello)
Got drugs in yo' system (huh), no hugs and no kissin' (uh uh)
Got interviewed by undercover's
They askin' bout pimpin' (is that right?)
You brought this heat on me (you did)
Ask you why you cheat on me (bitch)
Versace sheets on me (designer)
Now you in the streets lonely (it's Philthy y'all)
Two sides of the story (two of 'em), but you can't tell the truth
Them fake porcelains in your mouth (fake bitch), 2000 a tooth
No I don't want yo' ass no more (uh uh)
But before I let you go (you wanna get up outta here?)
Why you call yourself a Barbie (huh)?
Bitch I just wanna know (it's Philthy)

[Chorus]
Why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense
To me it don't make no sense
Why you call yourself a Barbie
The Barbie was plastic
That mean she was a fake bitch
Ass shots and fake tits
To me it don't make no sense
To me it don't make no sense
