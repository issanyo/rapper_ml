[Hook: J. Stalin]
And I just wish you was still here, here
My nigga would have rolled for me
And I just you was still here, here
My nigga kick in a door for me
You made me feel loved when I had no money
You never changed remember niggas used to call me bummy, bummy
That's why I love you way past money, money
That's why I love you way past money, money
And I just wish you was still here, here, here, here, here
And I just wish you was still here, here, here
But I'ma see you again

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Yeah, and I just wish you was still here
Cause I know you would have rolled for me
100, you ain't never stole from me
Stitched lip, he ain't never told on me
Real nigga for real nigga
Been my nigga since we was lil niggas
On everything I love you boy
For you I drop a whole 100 boy
Double back and drop another 100 boy
Check on your momma and daughter all the time
I can't believe the pigs gave you all that time (fuck em though)
Whatever you need done just breathe on me
I know you heard about the suckas tryna squeeze on me
And I just wish you was still here
Whenever you need me nigga I'm still there
Cause I don't care about the consequences
I'll dome anybody for you on my momma children

[Hook: J. Stalin]
And I just wish you was still here, here
My nigga would have rolled for me
And I just you was still here, here
My nigga kick in a door for me
You made me feel loved when I had no money
You never changed remember niggas used to call me bummy, bummy
That's why I love you way past money, money
That's why I love you way past money, money
And I just wish you was still here, here, here, here, here
And I just wish you was still here, here, here
But I'ma see you again (Hey it's Philthy nigga, rest in peace Dre Fetti)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, been thinking 'bout my nigga F since my nigga left (Fetti)
Chills in my body, pain in my chest (huh)
Slide on them niggas till ain't none them left (none em)
Until then nigga I can never rest (never)
And still fuck the other side (yeah)
I'm only satisfied when it's homicide (I am)
Give a fuck when his homie dies (fuck them niggas)
Made that nigga momma cry (fuck that bitch too)
They made my nigga momma cry (they did that)
So nigga it was only right (it's only right)
Sliding all through the night (slide)
Niggas know it's on sight (pussy)
Nigga should've taken his own life (shoulda)
Better off committing suicide (Is that right?)
Nigga trippin' for life (I am)
The definition of funk or die (it's Philthy)

[Hook: J. Stalin]
And I just wish you was still here, here

And I just wish you was still here, here, here, here, here
And I just wish you was still here, here, here
But I'ma see you again
