[Chorus]
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
It's Philthy

[Verse 1]
I say I hit the lot for the Masi truck
Fell in love with the Bentley truck
Broke nigga I got my money up
You can tell that nigga pull the rental up
New Chanel bag, this a one of one
Bitch already had bought you one
You ain't even wear the other one
Already askin' for another one
S63 with the AMG, told the bitch she need to pay a P
Matter fact you should be paying me
We gon' move to Vegas when the Raiders leave
Pulled up in my i8, bitch blowin' up my I-7
I done poured up a whole eight, sippin dirty Fanta at the 7-Eleven
Red bottoms on a tall bitch
Them hundreds face blue like they all sick
He don't want smoke, he better call quits
'Cause this beef shit, bitch I'm all in
Brought a brick of Tech and brought another one
Copped a new whip then copped another one
Bust down the Rollie, bust another one
I'ma run it up and blow another one, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
It's Philthy

[Verse 2]
I say now, Forgiatos, no flow to cap
The trunk on it where the motor at
Pussy nigga never sold a sack
He be rappin' 'bout it but we know the facts
Two hundred thou, that's before the tax
Broke nigga couldn't've afforded that
Told the bitch I gotta call her back
I got a play up, I need to quarterback
A hundred thou, I need another one
Out of state, I need another run
Caught a body while I'm on the run
This a throwaway, I need another gun
Eight hundred for a new pistol
Brand new and in mint condition
Thirty on me, it can shoot missile
I'm at the cookie store up in San Francisco
Told the bitch I'm tryna fuck her sister
Yeah bitch, I'm tryna fuck your sister
I been tryna fuck her for a minute
I ain't trippin', you can fuck her with me
She pulled up on me in a nigga Bentley
I told her, bitch your nigga penny pinchin'
Drop it back off to him empty
This Rollie on me cost a whole sixty, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
Just hit the lot for a new foreign, fucked around and got another one
New Rollie with the big face, all bust down, brought another one
Hundred thou all blue hundreds, done fucked around and count another one
Thirty thou for a brick of soft, man fuck it let me get another one
It's Philthy
