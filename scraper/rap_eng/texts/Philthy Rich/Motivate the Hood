[Intro] Funk or die

Niggas leave by example
Elevation requires separation
Look look
[Hook]
I'm just trying to motivate hood put my niggas on
Still screaming "Free J Bay" my nigga gon
Hundred thou my designer jeans my money loan
I'm just trying to motivate the hood put my niggas on [3x]
[Verse 1]
Now iPhone 6 face crate
Hit the house let the safe crate
Pussy nigga leave his face crate
Slide a bitch got some [?]
A half of brick in my favor
A line on act from [?]
Dopephine hooked up  to cable
Watch some [?] and Diego
I just counted an other hundred thou like ten minutes
Told a bitch she need to come back in about ten minutes
All of this money on the floor bitch mind Yo' business
I don't know if she trying to set me up or if you snitchin
Look I used to live in the Trap spot
And I'm the only black nigga on my block
Used to bag up Crack Rocks
Used to cook it up in a crack pot
Buss down no stop watch
Pussy niggas wanna stop my clock
Gemmed on them when it got hot
But they linked my nigga to a Shots spot
[Hook]
I'm just trying to motivate hood put my niggas on
Still screaming "Free J Bay" my nigga gon
Hundred thou my designer jeans my money loan
I'm just trying to motivate the hood put my niggas on [2x]
[Verse 2]
The bitch said she got trap for me
Tell the hoe we can meet whenever
Sucka nigga say wanna hop
You can tell him we can meet whenever
Povate you can't see the belt
So put your glasses on so you can see the belt
The bitch told me to treat her better that's only cause you let her do whatever
I'm on south beach on  jet-skies

Half a million on a piece like me

If a nigga gon putcho hands out

Tell them niggas better stand down
Cause this money on me can't [?] down
Get the call that your man down
Told them niggas I ain't playing around

You is real soft where you from
You ain't been back in months
Niggas talkin about that you can't come
[Hook]
I'm just trying to motivate hood put my niggas on
Still screaming "Free J Bay" my nigga gon
Hundred thou my designer jeans my money loan
I'm just trying to motivate the hood put my niggas on [2x]
