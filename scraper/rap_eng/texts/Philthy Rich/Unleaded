[Hook: Paperboy Rell]
We gassin' niggas no unleaded
Straight gas nigga no credit
Fucking with the Mob and you gon' get it
30 rounds in my clip Glock 27
Pull up on yo ass with this automatic
Couple shooters in the car that'll let you have it
Broad daylight yeah my niggas gunnin'
Usain Bolt how you niggas runnin'

[Verse 1: Young Bossi]
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Niggas sneak dissing but I don't let it phase me
Cocaine crazy this trap game paid me
Born in the 80's the dope dealers raised me
Dope era niggas talking till I whip out the cater
You a captain-save-her I'ma money chaser
Gucci blazer AR with the laser
Jesus piece with the jew-els more mail off crack sales
I played the cards I was dealt, I can't fold nigga
With my nigga Philthy fish scale I'm a cold killa
Put them shootas on your head you a hoe nigga
Disrespecting the Mob you gotta go nigga
Free my niggas in the pen, all we do is win
Chea, hope I never have to kill again
Ridin' dirty with the kicks on the turnpike
Still plugged with the lean and the China white

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
It's Philthy nigga, aha
Look, I'm in the Acura accurate aim
In the kitchen remixing compressing them thangs
Yeah I used to be broke so I rarely complained
Same clothes for 3 days ignoring the stains
6 deep so Ion't gotta rap
Quick to blow 100 thousand Ion't gotta stack
At the lot last week tryna cop the Rari
A arcade in the house I used to play Atari
Still in the hood cause I never left
Told em' ice the bezel out till there's nothing left
50 thousand on shoes I only wore once
Niggas do the white tile and they don't war with us
How your team strong but your boss a bitch?
He's tryna buy your respect it's gon' cost a bit
Fake niggas with a lot of money
I'll have some real niggas come take it from ya

[Hook]
We gassin' niggas no unleaded

Broad daylight yeah my niggas gunnin'
Usain Bolt how you niggas runnin'

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Still on some mainey shit I wiggle with an alias
Hell Gang my religion I'm putting all my faith in it
Stretching out a Backwood pouring up an eighth in it
40 pop fresh up out the box Mob maintenance
My trenches is ridiculous couldn't spend a day in it
It ain't no point in having a yicki if you don't stay with it
The pigs tryna label us crazy what they be making up
Mama texting my phone telling me I should straighten up
I could never work at McDonald's cause they don't pay enough
I shouldn't be the one that you follow cause I don't pray enough
Forgive me for my sins I'm a man promise to make it up
The substance that I snuff out this hunnid really wake you up
Cater drum stuffed with a hunnid go get your Yankees up
Play with us open your stomach and have it stapled up
The cater drum stuffed with a hunnid go get your Yankees up
Play with us open your stomach and have it stapled up
