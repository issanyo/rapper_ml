[Intro: Ray Vicks]
Yeah I'm CMR livin' nigga
Cars, money, and Rolexs
Street nigga though
Whole lot of dirty money
L-Finguz

[Chorus: Ray Vicks]
I count that money with a passion (a passion)
Sell that work with a passion (a passion)
Million dollars for my fashion (fashion)
My lifestyle ain't average (it ain't average)
Bustdown and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Bad bitch worth millions (worth millions)
New coupe and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Money dirty, yeah it's filthy (dirty)

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Baton Rouge, me and Ray Vicks (salute)
Rollie on, got a face lift (bustdown)
Keep it solid, don't say shit (solid)
Pussy niggas make statements (pussy)
Bad bitch, no basic (bad bitch)
Chanel Bleu my fragrance (is that right?)
Hundred rounds on the K clip (uh-huh)
Your baby mama on a day shift (bitch)
Designer, I'm in the latest (designer)
Diamonds on me outrageous (VS1)
Wave hi to my neighbors (hello)
Six gram house gators (it's Philthy)
That foreign he in outdated (foreign)
That chain he got on plated (fu-fu)
That Rollie cost me eighty (swear to God)
CMR, no baby (it's Philthy)

[Chorus: Ray Vicks]
I count that money with a passion (a passion)
Sell that work with a passion (a passion)
Million dollars for my fashion (fashion)
My lifestyle ain't average (it ain't average)
Bustdown and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Bad bitch worth millions (worth millions)
New coupe and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Money dirty, yeah it's filthy (dirty)

[Verse 2: Ray Vicks]
Foreign cars need details (damn)
Gas bags on retail
Young nigga at the crack house (what?)
Hit the phone when you see 12 (gone)
CMR, yeah I'm livin' (I'm livin')
Twelve months out of prison (flexin')
Money dirty, yeah its filthy (dirty)
I done ran through a million (an M)
I spend that money with a passion (a passion)
Me and Marty in an Aston (gone)
Forty-five for the bustdown
Just in case a nigga askin' (pussy)
Dirty money with the blood stains (woo)
Fell in love with the drug game
More money than a rap nigga
Had a bag 'fore the buzz came

[Chorus: Ray Vicks]
I count that money with a passion (a passion)
Sell that work with a passion (a passion)
Million dollars for my fashion (fashion)
My lifestyle ain't average (it ain't average)
Bustdown and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Bad bitch worth millions (worth millions)
New coupe and it's filthy (it's filthy)
Money dirty, yeah it's filthy (dirty)
