[Chorus: Benny]
I got connection on weapons
I got connection, don't test us
Summertime, better vest up
'Cause when me my niggas slide, we gon' wet you
Chop make a nigga bubble in our best shit
Watch out for them set ups
Out here in these streets I won't let up
Bag chasin', I'm stackin' my bread up
Best duck when I slide with my brothers

[Verse 1: $tupid Young]
You know I'ma slide with my brothers
On the gang, I'ma ride with my brothers
Nine milli, forty-five with my brothers
In the field every day, goin' live with my brothers, ayy
RIP to my killers that ain't here
Free my locs that I ain't seen in years
You know I got it, representin' for my peers
'Cause we done put in too much blood, sweat, and tears
We ain't worried 'bout a motherfuckin' setback
If a nigga hit us, you know we get back
Where your hood, where your turf, where your set at?
Slide through broad day and we gon' wet that
Everybody already know I don't do it for the fame
Everything I do, I gotta represent the gang
$tupid Young, dollar sign, you already know the name
And they hit my line up when they need them thangs, 'cause

[Chorus: Benny]
I got connection on weapons
I got connection, don't test us
Summertime, better vest up
'Cause when me my niggas slide, we gon' wet you
Chop make a nigga bubble in our best shit
Watch out for them set ups
Out here in these streets I won't let up
Bag chasin', I'm stackin' my bread up
Best duck when I slide with my brothers

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Health is wealth, so you know I left the juice alone
Thinkin' to myself, ridin' in this coupe alone
Stuck on the block, tryna move a zone
Locked up, ain't have no one to call, just wanted to use the phone
Ain't nobody answer, my grandmama died of cancer
She the one that raised me, could've grew up a bastard
She wanted me in the church next to the pastor
But I was too hard-headed, always got my ass whooped
A couple bumps and bruises, fifty rounds out the Uzi
Little man complex, I wasn't into losing
Every enemy I had, I left that nigga snoozin'
And he ain't wakin' up, no matter how much you move him
Real nigga, no flaw in my DNA
I was blind to it all 'til I seen the way
Backpage shut down, it was a G a day
Now it's sugar daddy, arrows, and TNA, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Benny]
I got connection on weapons
I got connection, don't test us
Summertime, better vest up
'Cause when me my niggas slide, we gon' wet you
Chop make a nigga bubble in our best shit
Watch out for them set ups
Out here in these streets I won't let up
Bag chasin', I'm stackin' my bread up
Best duck when I slide with my brothers
