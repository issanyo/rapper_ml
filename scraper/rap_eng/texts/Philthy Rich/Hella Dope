[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Bitches never put me in the friend zone, yeah
Roll another one, yeah I been gone
Six one, caught it in the endzone, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
No plan for the robbery
Just a honey thing and a killer in the driver's seat
Real nigga shit, feds couldn't break the silence either
Still winning checks, weight set eighty inch screen
In my living room
Sold a half a key in the D, 'bout to finish soon
Niggas know I been a goon
Ever since a pup, smoking kush in my mama joint
K's with bananas on
Suckers act tough, they don't overstand the code
Hope you overstand the code, streets that we standing on
Real niggas say we dope 'cause we on the shit they on
Why my niggas stuck in prison, pray to god we blow
Say our music's like dope how it got 'em through
So we thuggin', 'til we put his family on
And I just wanna smoke every nigga in the car with you

[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Bitches never put me in the friend zone, yeah
Roll another one, yeah I been gone
Six one, caught it in the endzone, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say S63, with the seats on recline
'62 Maybach with the tints on the blinds
For my time to shine I waited patiently in line
Niggas ain't seen it in me, guess they was partially blind
I got niggas doing time that'll never see the light
I been around the world once and spoke to everybody twice
Enemies sending kites, can't sleep through the night
Better keeps her a knife, then the Loosey got life
I'd rather call her my bitch than call her my wife
You can blame my baby mama, the bitch cheated on me twice
Ayy Pooh remember them niggas who tried to cheat me on the dice
Laid the dice game down, then I slapped you with the pipe
Now I'm first class with my feet up on the flight
Six hour flight to Memphis, I'll be there by tonight
Ayy free my brother Dip, he locked up in Angola
Listened to me on Pandora while he whippin' coca soda
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Erk Tha Jerk]
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Bitches never put me in the friend zone, yeah
Roll another one, yeah I been gone
Six one, caught it in the endzone, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo, yeah

[Outro: Erk Tha Jerk]
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Hella dope, sitting real low in my Benzo
Probably in the endzone, yeah
