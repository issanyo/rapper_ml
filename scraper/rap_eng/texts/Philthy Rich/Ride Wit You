[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Ooh I'm tryna come through shawty
I know you want me to shawty
I'm tryna pull up on you and give you what you needin'
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
I can tell you love the way that I rock
I'm on my way to the loft, you tryna take somethin' off?
I'm tryna take somethin' down, I been facing this loud
I got a trap out of town, we still trap out of town
Need fifteen a show without 'em pattin' me down
In this pretty European, all black and she proud
The whip smelling like I'm trafficking pounds
And if you ever doubted, laugh at me now, we on top baby
Got one account with over five hundred thou
Holler at me if you're tryna be down, you know I keep it cloudy
Put some 'spect on it when you speak about me
If she ain't 'bout a check can't be around me
She ain't 'bout a check can't be around me
If she ain't 'bout a check can't be around me
Save the small talk baby, be about it
You mean the world to me, now think about it

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Ooh I'm tryna come through shawty
I know you want me to shawty
I'm tryna pull up on you and give you what you needin'
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
When I don't be around you, sometimes I think about you
I can't lie, yeah it's true
You heard I'm really with the shit, huh?
Before the fame and got rich, oh yeah
So when we talk I need stepses
You with the pull up then come function
I'm tryna learn all your functions
Tryna let you know something, yeah
It's real when you in the field with it
That's what come with it, so we deal with it
Brand new Porsche on the hill chilling
I done made a hundred on the real so I
Can't talk if it ain't about a check
If it ain't about a check
You be callin' when I'm stunting just to check on me
Like damn, I wish that you was next in

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Ooh I'm tryna come through shawty
I know you want me to shawty
I'm tryna pull up on you and give you what you needin'
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
First off, have you ever fucked a rich nigga?
Bitch that nigga broke if he ain't playin' with six figures
Hella talkin' to the bitch so he can get with her
Plus he insecure, keep asking if his dick bigger
Four dollar Giuseppe store on babe hills
Just know this love unconditional for babe real
A hundred thousand all blue, big face bills
Mozzy said the love he got for the Bay real
My ex bitch fagged off, couldn't stay still
I was up against it, asking for a state deal
Now it's reservations for two, eating steak meals
Between the house, cars, and ice like eight mil
See baby girl I don't know how the fake feel
Ask them 'bout doctor Miami to stacks on the bill
Her nigga name tatted on her so you know it's real
She prayin' that I make it home when I'm in the field, it's Philth

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Ooh I'm tryna come through shawty
I know you want me to shawty
I'm tryna pull up on you and give you what you need
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah
I'm tryna ride with you, ride with you, yeah
