[Chorus: Marko Penn]
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down
Got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, I can't help but want to
Touch it and squeeze it, all night long (all night long)
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, Giuseppe heels on her, mami be swaggin' (designer)
Told her pull up on me in the G-Wagon (foreign)
Never outside in the streets lackin' (Seminary)
Brick ain't sealed, gotta rewrap it (thirty-six)
Look in her eyes, all I see is passion (solid)
She throw that thing back for a reaction (for a real nigga)
She need a couple G's by Sunday (couple of 'em)
She play AOD's on a Monday (stumped)
He all in your ear, what he beggin' for? (broke nigga)
She might hit Vegas, play crazy horse (she just might)
I'm a real nigga, I ain't payin' for it (uh-uh)
Got me in my zone and I'm ready for it (I am)
My San Jo' bitch play pink poodle (is that right?)
Stacks in her purse and a pink Ruger (keep it on her)
Ass so fat, I love the way she move it (ayy it's Philthy bitch)
Netflix and chill, let's go and make a movie

[Chorus: Marko Penn]
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down
Got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, I can't help but want to
Touch it and squeeze it, all night long (all night long)
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, I'm up in H-Town, all in V-Live (I am)
I'm the nigga your boyfriend want to be like (he do)
Say she from Atlanta work in Magic City (is that right?)
Where I'm from I'm the man up in my city (Seminary)
She got them double C's all on her bag (designer)
You a bad bitch if he never told you that (you is)
Lil mama gettin' naked for a lot of ones (a lot of ones)
No money problems, got a pocket full of huns (it's Philthy)
Them ballers in the club gonna make it rain (they is)
I'm just tryna see your lil pussy rain (ayy let me see)
Thick bitch from the D, work at Silver Rain (what it look like?)
This fourteen carat, he got a silver chain (fu-fu)
The foreign outside got imported in (foreign)
Three hundred thousand, can't afford one of them (broke nigga)
She ran to the floor, she heard him comin' in (it's Philthy ho)
Later on tonight I'm gonna come again, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Marko Penn]
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down
Got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, I can't help but want to
Touch it and squeeze it, all night long (all night long)
Girl you got me in my zone right now when that ass go down, when that ass go down
