[Intro: Q Da Fool]
Still rich, bitch I'm still rich
Uh

[Verse 1: Q Da Fool]
Still in the trenches with my goons, with my thugs, and I'm still rich
I ain't sign no deal, man I just sold drugs, tryna get it
I had the shit but I'ma stick it, feel like niggas con to me
So I gotta keep a lot of heat, so I gotta keep a lot of heat
Bad hoes keep callin' me, tryna fuck, tryna fuck, tryna fuck
Hoes all in my DM, tryna suck, tryna suck, tryna suck
Can't wait 'til my wrist flooded, can't wait 'til my neck flooded
Can't wait 'til my ears flooded, got out the mud, bitch I'm muddy
Niggas snake me out so it's gon' be cruddy
I don't want friends, don't need buddies
Bitch sucked on my kids like a Huggie
At my show all these hoes tryna hug me

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Want all the smoke, I want all the smoke
Bitch I got a hundred and I got a fifty, you know how it go
Uh, I want all the smoke, uh, I want all the smoke
I want all the smoke
Call the plug, tell him that I'm buyin' all this coke
Uh, I want all the smoke, uh, I want all the smoke, uh
I want all the smoke
Call the plug, tell him that I'm buyin' all this coke

[Verse 2: Q Da Fool]
Niggas swinging them chopsticks
XD's and them Glocks hit
We on that flooding your block shit
Tryna shoot, you gettin' blocked quick
I got them keys, locksmith
Lil bro got a forty, that bitch a Smith
We got that coke, crockpot
The pack came in soft, now we cookin' it

[Interlude: Q Da Fool]
Cookin' it
Grab the biggest one right there bruh
Lil bruh I told you, close the door
I don't know what they on so
I don't wanna keep doin', I don't wanna keep yellin' and shit
Yeah man, you already know I, know I got it
This here here here, see, I'ma get it, I'ma get it to you when I'm done, uh

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
F&N cost me two stacks
Designer shoes cost me two stacks
Everything I spit is true facts
Fuck around and get your crew whacked
Tie her up, won't get your boo back
Foreign whip, where the roof at?
I'm trigger happy but you knew that
All day ones, no new cats
Line him up for some chump change
My niggas doin' bad anyway
Stuffed a hundred up in the K
A hundred thousand up in the safe
These other niggas up in the way
I'm the realest nigga up in the Bay
You ever seen a million dollars in your face?
It'll drive you crazy, fuck up your day
I been drivin' crazy, fucked up the Wraith
Yeah the middle man fucked up the play
My niggas kickin' doors, fuck up your place
They'll knock you down if they up the K, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Want all the smoke, I want all the smoke
Bitch I got a hundred and I got a fifty, you know how it go
Uh, I want all the smoke, uh, I want all the smoke
I want all the smoke
Call the plug, tell him that I'm buyin' all this coke
Uh, I want all the smoke, uh, I want all the smoke, uh
I want all the smoke
Call the plug, tell him that I'm buyin' all this coke
