[Chorus: Go Yayo]
I just want to be filthy fuckin' rich, yeah
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I'm tryna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, yeah, yeah, filthy fuckin' rich
I wanna be, filthy fuckin' rich, yeah

[Verse 1: Go Yayo]
Go Yayo won't trip on no ho
Fuck her, send her out the door
You know how that shit go
Gotta keep a foot on these bitches' throat
Woo, yeah, dog her out, make her go get a check
Scandal season is now back in effect
And we don't treat none of these hoes with respect
We passin' these bitches, you know that we go and get it
My life is a show, you don't wanna miss it
Young niggas out here just chasing digits
We don't want the fame, we just want the ticket
We just tryna see a million cash
Big old thooka for your pussy ass
Pop up on 'em, yeah you gettin' smashed
Leave your face down all in the grass
Run in your mama's house and act a fool
We don't know you, we just acting cool
Smoke a nigga like a pack of cool
Pull up right now and embarrass you
I'm so high, I need a parachute
You don't need no thooka, you scared to shoot
You niggas is pussy, it's evident
Murder scene, won't leave no evidence

[Chorus: Go Yayo]
I just want to be filthy fuckin' rich, yeah
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I'm tryna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, yeah, yeah, filthy fuckin' rich
I wanna be, filthy fuckin' rich, yeah

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I said now pull up on 'em in a new foreign
If it ain't foreign then that shit boring
Three hundred thou what I spent though
Three hundred dollars a day is what he rent it for
Me and Go Yayo, we was MIA though
Ridin' jet skis, no Winnebago
Bad bitches all in the stable
Only stole a bitch mind and some cable
Actavis all in my Faygo, Goyard all on my belt
Versace boxers all on my ass, Balmain pockets full of cash
Fifty pointers in the bracelet, Patek Philippe got a facelift
Fifty rounds in the K clip, out in Lil Vegas in a spaceship
A million dollars, nigga just some jewelry
His chain ain't real, we can't take him seriously
Free my niggas in preliminary
Fuck the judge and fuck the jury
The Maybach on to-do list
Eat stuffed chicken at the Ruth Chris
Poppin' pimpin' to my new bitch
Couple hundred thou off blue strips, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Go Yayo]
I just want to be filthy fuckin' rich, yeah
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich
That's all I wanna be, that's all I'm tryna be, that's all I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I wanna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, filthy fuckin' rich, I'm tryna be
Filthy fuckin' rich, yeah, yeah, filthy fuckin' rich
I wanna be, filthy fuckin' rich, yeah
