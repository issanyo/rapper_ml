[Verse 1: Cookie Money]

It's Cookie Money, boy

Streets talking, [?] ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, white rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him
Streets talking, cook ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, white rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him

Smoking dope, sipping lean in Philthy's big ass house
Nigga, you talk to police then you're a lil' ass mouse
I got some snakes in the grass that's gon' curl him out
Real nigga's 'bout that action and they ain't gon' fold
You niggas hide in the house and pillow talking to hoes
I'm meaning mean in these streets withs K's and Glocks that blow
It's Cookie Money the label and I'm baking this dough
Real niggas on top it ain't no faking no more
Rhyme, Forgi's on foreigns and they plated in gold
Fuck rapping, we was trapping just cooking up coke
I watched my nigga lose his sack he started sniffing the blow
He hate to see me do my thing so I don't see him no more
I watched my nigga lose his sack he started sniffing the blow
He hate to see me do my thing so I don't see him no more
Damn

[Chorus: Cookie Money]
Streets talking, [?] ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, [?] rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him
Streets talking, cook ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, [?] rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say 'Mess on dope and D be broke
These broke niggas, they'll die just to see me broke
It's gold Forgi's on the Masi, gold Forgi's on the Aston
Even on the Porsche, broke nigga stop asking
And I forgot they on the Beamer too
You ain't never feed your crew
That's why they don't fuck with you
I'm doing what real nigga's do
I fuck with lil'Cookie, hit the block and play hookie
And listen to my OG's and niggas who knew more then me
Syrup in my styrofoam, I mix it with the Rose
And I ain't give a fuck 'bout what a hoe say
Broke nigga's sneak dissin', they need to get they money up
That shit is kinda sad, my bitch in a pink Jag, nigga

[Chorus]
Streets talking, [?] ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, [?] rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him
Streets talking, cook ballin' niggas on it
He a savage in these streets so these pussy's gotta show him
Stay sipping on that Syrup, [?] rhyme with that 40
Keep a bad lil' bitch that strip and get it for him
