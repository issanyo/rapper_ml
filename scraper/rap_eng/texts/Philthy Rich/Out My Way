[Hook - Lil Jay]
I don’t mess with fake niggas
Fucked a lot of bitches
Know some real niggas
And I don't fuckin’ snitches
One thing on my mind
I gotta get it by any means necessary
I’m with it, aha
You niggas stay out my way
You niggas stay out my way
All you hoes stay out my face
I’m tryna get this cake
You niggas stay out my way
You hoes stay out my way
You lames stay out my way
Beause I’m tryna get this cake

[Verse 1 - Lil Jay]
All you lames, you can stay up out my way
I’m tryna make it till my team and my family straight
And if you fuck with me then you feel the k
Not tomorrow, you can die today
I put that on me, I can put that on the G
If a nigga fuck with me, then the boy gone D.I.E
And the shooter was me, that shit there like OD
And shout out Philthy, my nigga shot out with them heats
These pussy niggas talk, but they ain’t in these streets
They only want to twitter beef
But when I catch ’em black end, they can feel the heat
Man down on they fuckin’ street
Or on they fuckin’ block, fuck the fuckin’ cops
And fuck the fuckin’ ops, I fucked the fuckin’ thot
She gave me top, and then I kicked her out
I’m bout the dough, I neva seen a drought

[Hook - Lil Jay]
I don’t mess with fake niggas
Fucked a lot of bitches
Know some real niggas
And I don't fuckin’ snitches
One thing on my mind
I gotta get it by any means necessary
I’m with it, aha
You niggas stay out my way
You niggas stay out my way
All you hoes stay out my face
I’m tryna get this cake
You niggas stay out my way
You hoes stay out my way
You lames stay out my way
Beause I’m tryna get this cake

[Verse 2 - Philthy Rich]
Look, I count a hundred grand this mornin’
And greased up the .40 for niggas that tryna run up on me
Man down, I never stand down
You don’t want a rap beef from me, lil’ nigga
You want a hand out
I’m in Chiraq nigga with the K’s out
Seminary, million dollar spot, we neva seen a drought
On my way to the money, take the scenic route
And if I see them suckas linger, I’ma aim out
All my life, I’m a rider till the end end
Can't take this money with me when I die so I’ma spend it
Rep the hood is in my bones, until a nigga gone
Everybody know about seminary across the globe
Now I don’t ghost ride, but I guess you ride with no problem
Only thing that ride between you and this gun nigga is yo problem
You betta give it up or 223’s will riddle ya
For all my niggas locked up, nigga, I’ma live it up

[Hook - Lil Jay]
I don’t mess with fake niggas
Fucked a lot of bitches
Know some real niggas
And I don't fuckin’ snitches
One thing on my mind
I gotta get it by any means necessary
I’m with it, aha
You niggas stay out my way
You niggas stay out my way
All you hoes stay out my face
I’m tryna get this cake
You niggas stay out my way
You hoes stay out my way
You lames stay out my way
Beause I’m tryna get this cake
