[Intro]
Not fucking with you hoes, I just came for the plug
Not stepping in no clubs, none of that

[Verse 1: Bandgang Paid Will]
Streets hard to stay out, I'm too deep in
Late night, Cali flight, that just for the weekend
Sharks over here don't come swimmin' in the deep end
Limo tint on the foreign, bitch gotta peek in
I ain't fuckin' with you hoes, I'm here for the plug
Just let my shooter know I'm here incase a nigga mug
Only came for one thang, I'm steppin' in the club
You say you got the best bud, let me be the judge
Ain't announced my appearance, I just popped up
Cookie get all my money, bitch I'm stocked up
Nosey [?] tryna stop us
But I'm too hardheaded, I can't stop brah
And that lean got me drowsy
Hotbox the rental, got the whole whip cloudy
Hit the top quick for them people tryna doubt me
Used a further address, catched the package then I'm outtie
The man in my city, [?] it ain't your's, you can't stand it
You would think I know I magic
I can make a nigga vanish
Gotta use my translator cause the plug speak spanish
Came too far bitch to leave [?]

[Chorus: Bandgang Paid Will]
I just came or the plug, I ain't here for no hoes
I just came to meet [beep], I ain't here for no shows
I ain't bring no luggage, just a bag to carry on
Got a pocket full of money, tryna send some shit home
I just came for the plug,  I ain't fuckin' with no hoes
I just came for the plug, I ain't comin' to no shows
I just came for the plug, I ain't shoppin' for no clothes
I just came for the plug, tryna send some shit home
I just came for the plug

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I done been around the world once and spoke to everybody twice
Bitch I just came for the plug, keep your advice
Send you a kilo in the club if your money right
Slide down Collins in the foreign to Miami nights
Might hit the D so I can fuck with Paid Will
The BandGang niggas got the deals on the seals
Rest in peace Dada, lil' bitch I don't wear no Prada
It's red bottoms only, they cost me at least 3000
You need a boat of pills, I might front 'em a couple thousand
I know he doing bad but just let me know when you got it
I live up in the 'burbs but I come from the public housings
Your baby momma naked, I let that hoe run around it
A 100 rounds on me I stuffed it up in the chopper
I pull in a minivan and let the killers hop out it
Bitch I'm in the kitchen with soda up in the beaker
The plug dropped the work off, I hit 'em up, his body leakin'

[Chorus: Bandgang Paid Will]
I just came or the plug, I ain't here for no hoes
I just came to meet [beep], I ain't here for no shows
I ain't bring no luggage, just a bag to carry on
Got a pocket full of money, tryna send some shit home
I just came for the plug,  I ain't fuckin' with no hoes
I just came for the plug, I ain't comin' to no shows
I just came for the plug, I ain't shoppin' for no clothes
I just came for the plug, tryna send some shit home
I just came for the plug
