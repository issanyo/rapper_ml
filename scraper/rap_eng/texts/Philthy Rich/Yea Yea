[Chorus: SYPH]
Hop out of that foreign, 'bout to stick it, yeah yeah

And even when I'm sleepin', man I'm countin', yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
It's two hundred and fifty in my Chase account
See that's a quarter milly if I take it out
I told a bitch, ain't got no time to take her out
No we don't do no dates and we ain't making out
I spent a hundred thousand just on Din and Dame
And then I spent another hundred on Mone and Main
Rest in peace to all my niggas bitch, and free the gang
This foreign in my garage, I can't pronounce the name
I fell asleep bitch, with the Rollie on
Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
My nigga Rich Real said get the Patek Philippe
He the only nigga I know had it before me, it's Philthy

[Chorus: SYPH]
Hop out of that foreign, 'bout to stick it, yeah yeah
They ain't gotta hear that I'm the nigga, yeah yeah
Baguettes on the Rollie'll be drippin', yeah yeah
And even when I'm sleepin', man I'm countin', yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
And even when I'm sleepin', man I'm countin', yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, rest in peace Bankroll Fresh
All I ever wanted was a bankroll and to be fresh
Sixty thousand in my Balmains
Bustdown Rollie, nigga can't afford it plain
My bitch rockin' the same thing
All these pieces 'round my neck all custom made
Poured an eight of Act up in my lemonade
These niggas so emotional, that's a female trait
I fell asleep bitch, with the AP on
Hit the AP store bitch, with the AP on
I drink Ros√©, no Avion
Got these broke niggas sick 'cause my paper long, it's Philthy

[Chorus: SYPH]
Hop out of that foreign, 'bout to stick it, yeah yeah
They ain't gotta hear that I'm the nigga, yeah yeah
Baguettes on the Rollie'll be drippin', yeah yeah
And even when I'm sleepin', man I'm countin', yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (ayy, ayy)
And even when I'm sleepin', man I'm countin', yeah yeah
