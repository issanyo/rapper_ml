[Intro: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy
See 'em talk down but your bitch show love, now I'm up
Startlet with the glow boy, bossed up like a dope boy, I'm up
From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy
Ayy it's Philthy nigga, uh-huh, look

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
From the Regal to the Wraith
I can tell what he thinkin', see the evil in his face
Hundred thou cash, got it stuffed in the safe
Hope I never get to touch it, leave it for a rainy day
It's hate in your pores and umbrellas in the doors
Used to serve winos and watch 'em stumble to the store
The closest people to you try to hurt you the most
Poppin' bottles in the club, celebrate when we toast
Ten K a show, seventy-five for a host
A real nigga show up to them fliers that I post
Motivate the youth and give the hood niggas hope
No I don't gangbang but fuck with bloods and the locs
Test driving Bentley trucks before they came out
These Jordans two weeks early, they ain't even came out
Sucker got smoked, you should've never came out
At every video shoot, I'm bringin' ever chain out, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy
See 'em talk down but your bitch show love, now I'm up
Starlet with the glow boy, bossed up like a dope boy, I'm up
From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy

[Verse 2: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Sellin' dime bags in my new Kilroys
Dope boy turned to the pimpin'
Seen a couple hoes like I'm Fillmore Slim
Too $hort told me that bitches ain't shit
Mac Dre told me to pop that thizz, ayy, so I popped that thizz
That's mouthpiece when I knock that bitch, hey
And I'm still knockin' her, mister popular
Headed to the top and you can't see him with binoculars
Spare time on airlines and redeyes
Bomb raps with contracts and deadlines
Low key with dope weed and head highs
Long way from airwaves and red vines
A couple thank you's when it's bedtime
The old me in my head like

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy
See 'em talk down but your bitch show love, now I'm up
Starlet with the glow boy, bossed up like a dope boy, I'm up
From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy

[Verse 3: ALLBLACK]
When I was a kid I dreamed big and never simped on the past
What I love is that bag and when I'm drunk in first class
What I kiss on is that gold and that wallet full of cash
Bring me joy and all these toys, it can't trip or get mad
Never get sick or wanna free it, I just will not, I can't
If I ain't got it, I'll have my 304's run a play
Love and protect this bankroll like Shaquille in the paint
Send them hoes diggin' for gold that wanna fuck me but they ain't
When I was text, callin' swim, all I heard was oh shit
If you would've asked me last week, boy I can't do his shit
I can't pull money out right now, I let my partner use it
Tell him he knowin' twelve ways with all them garbage excuses
I ain't givin' nan' bitch shit, givin' nan' nigga crumb
When y'all was flexin', I was praisin', I ain't beg y'all for none'
Bought my own bottles in the club, ain't have to fake live it up
It's okay, I got enough, take off your ass so I can tip the bar
It's BLACK

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I remember young nigga wanna be a dope boy
Ridin' 'round town in my whip on dubs
Young nigga wanna be a dope boy
See 'em talk down but your bitch show love, now I'm up
Starlet with the glow boy, bossed up like a dope boy, I'm up
From the Regal to the Rolls Royce, bossed up like a dope boy
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up
