[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras, whoa

[Post-Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
No cap, we havin' Act
No cap, I'm movin' packs
Yeah, no cap, I'm on the map
Yeah, no cap, I couldn't even fit these racks inside my Balmain jeans

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Actavis, nigga Actavis
Trap house, movin' packages
I remember I ain't have a pot to piss
Now I kiss the Act when I pop the lid
Hit the store for a Fanta nigga
This a Wraith, this ain't a Phantom nigga
Snuck in with the hammer nigga
We can shoot it out on camera nigga
Crushed ice with the double cup, prometh with the codeine
Told the bitch I don't cuddle up, on a broke bitch I caught a cold lean
Nod off on the whole team, I sold dope, I never sold dreams
Thirty-two for a sixteen, tell that nigga I need the whole thing
Actavis and Fanta nigga, Fanta got Actavis up in it
I'ma water whip a two liter, and straight drop a whole eight up in it
Rest in peace Pimp C nigga, you can see that I'm a pimp nigga
Rest in peace to the Jack niggas, sip my pain away sippin' Act nigga

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras, whoa

[Post-Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
No cap, we havin' Act
No cap, I'm movin' packs
Yeah, no cap, I'm on the map
Yeah, no cap, I couldn't even fit these racks inside my Balmain jeans

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Pour out that Actavis, I gotta have it, bitch I'm an addict
See I be off percocets, xannys, and addys, same time, bitch add it
Five thousand for a baggage, that's the Goyard stick
I know that she in love with that cocaine, told her go hard bitch
'Cause I'm havin' flake on me just like some dandruff, VS on me and they dancin'
See I'm livin' life with a couple enhancements, I might just trap out a mansion
Lil bitch you know that I'm havin', I know that you never had it, yeah
Young and I'm rich and I'm handsome, I fit these bitches up, ran 'em, yeah
If you charge for that pussy, just bill me
You know I'm rich just like Philthy, yeah
Soon as you see the triple cover Act runnin' empty, bitch go refill me
The VV's in the face of the Rollie made the ho act like she know me, huh?
'Til the day that I run out of money, bitch I'm drinkin' one thing only, woo

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras
Actavis and Fanta (Actavis and Fanta)
Fuck a bitch on camera (fuck a bitch on camera)
Sway you ain't got the answers (Sway you ain't got the answers)
Mansion house full of dancers, trap it out with the extras, whoa

[Post-Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
No cap, we havin' Act
No cap, I'm movin' packs
Yeah, no cap, I'm on the map
Yeah, no cap, I couldn't even fit these racks inside my Balmain jeans

[Outro: Jazz Lazer]
I couldn't love a bitch as much as I love my lean
I couldn't sip the dirty dirty dirty if it ain't clean
I fuck on my average bitch and now she got a higher self-esteem
I only acquire OG, if you smokin' reggie, fuck you mean?
