[Intro: Jazz Lazer]
Ayy
Ayy ayy ayy

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy
Rolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy
This one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Hop out another foreign while these diamonds jump out the face
Your baby mama pussy borin', told that ho to hop out the Wraith
It's stars in my ceiling ho, centerfolds in my videos
I talk shit and I swallow spit, but I don't never talk to no pillow ho
Put in every foreign that nigga name, when I was broke, niggas didn't complain
Everything big candy paint, your shit was sprayed with a can of paint
In the Bentley with the breitling on, AP in the Maserati
Hundred thousand in my left pocket
And a bad bitch that's gon' sell her body
Niggas play with me, they gon' check about it
Too many bulletholes, they can't check the body
I just placed a call, and I placed a hit
Niggas pull up and get the check about it
Your BM in my DM, I'm in a BM in the PM
If not nigga, I'm in the Audi thing
Just copped another diamond chain, It's Philthy

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy
Rolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy
This one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy

[Verse 2: Yowda]
Went from the Ghost to the drophead
The car look live but the top dead
Bad bitch on my passenger, she from North Africa
Goons in the backseat, they mopheads
I hit the valet and they drop dead
Million dollars in the driveway
Rappers lookin' at me sideways
But all this came up off the highway
Tried to tell them niggas crime pays
Now it's tension 'cause they didn't listen
My neck glisten from the kitchen
I'm shittin', boy my roof is missin'
Got lamb on the floor, stars in the ceiling
Tint on the windows, it feel like I'm hidden
The ceiling console got a touch screen
The car do tricks as soon as I fill it
My money is up, same car as your idol
The engine purr like a kitten when it idle
You niggas is leasin' and I got the title
The engine V12 and the doors suicidal
Ballin' on these niggas like I was Michael
Jackson, Jordan, Tyson, and Bodine
This would be floatin', it feel like I'm boatin'
A shark in this bitch and these streets is my ocean

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy
Rolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy
This one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
Uh, Dade County
Hop out another foreign, with a bad bitch lookin' like she foreign, uh
Hop out another foreign, my whip so big, lookin' like we tourin'
These niggas mad 'cause they whip is borin'
I'm ridin' 'round with young Steph Curry
My dog a shooter, he'll leave you buried
Motherfuck a shooter, I shoot him, hit his medulla
I left the dealer, had to get some new rims
Your bitch wanna do 'em, ain't nothin' new
Brand new S-550, look at the view
I like the four door but I copped the coupe
Got your bitch ridin' the shotgun, got another bitch behind her
Uh, so I got the two, ain't no question that I'm fuckin' your boo
'Cause the foreign white and black like Pepé Le Pew
'Cause the foreign white and black like Pepé Le Pew

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy
Rolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy
This one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
Hop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy
