[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
NIgga I be on that road getting my scrilla right
Imma motherfuckin' road runner in real life
My dog kick cost a hunnid nigga thats reals ice
Big bucks, make yo bitch stunt nigga thats pill life
Top dawg around this bitch whole gang aggressive
A nigga touch me I have my man stretch you
Imma get that shit to neph and let him bench press it
5 hunnid 20s, a hunnid hunnids got yo bitch naked
I told Smoke their on their way I sent that big package
Man these niggas all talk they don't want no static
I act a fool with a chopper the bitch so dramatic
Adrenaline start rushin' right before I racket
Antt Beatz in this bitch he got his draco wit him
AP walked in he got a Faygo wit him
Did him in a shoot out in traffic we go chase dem niggas
Hate dam niggas
Pull up on the side of em, paint dem niggas

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
The nigga said I was broke I'm like bitch where
Turn around and came back with all brick fare
He in his feelings just because I heard his bitch stare
We won't be long soon as we get there
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
Remember when was down now I got money now

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Allota niggas from my hood old and bitter
I did this on my own bitch I don't owe no nigga
I know them niggas hate it when I turn around
New foreign off the lot Im acting it funny now
I just poured up a brick the other day
Wish it was my young nigga birthday
You know I put them chains on my whole team
This life that I live bitch yo dream
Hit the mall wit all this designer on
Then I leave the mall with all new designer on
Vans on my feet call me cost my 3 thou
Took a nigga main bitch Philthy Rich style

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
The nigga said I was broke I'm like bitch where
Turn around and came back with all brick fare
He in his feelings just because I heard his bitch stare
We won't be long soon as we get there
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
Remember when was down now I got money now

[Verse 3: FMB DZ]
Quit turn around I got dat shit on me that stick me
I don't give a fuck about yo big homie
Big bully out here can't no nigga out here pick on me
Hit a nigga dead in this shit and then I spit on him
I don't fabricate shit I just state facts
Yeah I'm down for my niggas like A-Wax

Made enough to feed the whole team [?]
A nigga outta line we got get his ass
Hit his ass

My nigga keep a big choppa you know how I'm rockin'
Ain't no limit wit this shits I feel like Silkk The Shokker

[Hook: Antt Beatz]
The nigga said I was broke I'm like bitch where
Turn around and came back with all brick fare
He in his feelings just because I heard his bitch stare
We won't be long soon as we get there
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
They hate it when I turn around
Remember when was down now I got money now
