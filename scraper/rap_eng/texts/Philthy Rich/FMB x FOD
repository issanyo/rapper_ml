[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
Niggas ain't built for this street shit
Fuck a freak bitch, I'm in that water, it got deep quick
Been on a cruise for a week, bitch I'm seasick
Dark tint on the bus, I can't see shit
Five thousand for the fit, this ain't no cheap shit
And I can do that shit again like a remix
These AR's I'm ridin' with could make a tree flip
Turn one into two, make a key flip
Livin' like the mob, givin' niggas jobs
If you fuckin' up that work you know you better hide
We ain't shootin' up no cribs, we gon' come inside
My nigga Philthy got a mansion with a big garage

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Fast Money, we an army nigga, we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga, ain't no savin' niggas
Fast Money, we an army nigga, we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga, ain't no savin' niggas
FMB, yeah we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga
FMB, yeah we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Money makin' is my thing, I'm just tryna be rich
In the kitchen with them bricks, I was tryna remix
FOD that's my clique, Seminary the block
Pussy niggas get shot and we don't talk to the cops
I go by the name of Philthy
Drop two-hundred on your street, we was too deep
And my bitch lined him up, he was too sweet
He was thinkin' with his dick, sometimes that's how it be, bitch it's FOD
Broke bitches all in my grill
Nigga shot the foreign up, tried to get me killed
But I'm still on Seminary, worth a couple mil
FOD highly respected without a record deal, bitch we in the field

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Fast Money, we an army nigga, we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga, ain't no savin' niggas
Fast Money, we an army nigga, we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga, ain't no savin' niggas
FMB, yeah we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga
FMB, yeah we go crazy nigga
FOD shoot like the Navy nigga
