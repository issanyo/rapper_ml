[Chorus: Dex Osama]
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh

[Verse 1: Dex Osama]
I want rock like a caveman
I'm a motherfuckin' made man
You heard what happened to the last nigga, huh
Put his ass in the bag nigga
They think they ready but I don't think they ready
When it's niggas on the block wishin' they had spaghetti
Me and my niggas came a long ways
They skippin' school out there, hangin' in the hallways
We got the white keys, we just want the deals
We got the ice, nigga we want the mils
She got the pussy so I stuffed the pills
Quick to pick the chopper up like Meek will do a wheel
Pump your brake, watch for snake, they fill up fields
Push a nigga line back, give him the Uncle Phil
All that loose talk, we ain't with that
Pull up to your playpen and get your kids snatched, bitch

[Chorus: Dex Osama]
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say I put in work for my reputation
Real nigga my occupation
No loyalty, no dedication
White diamonds on me, no segregation
Put a hundred thou on a nigga head
You can pick it up when that nigga dead
They was pickin' up all the fuckin' lead
Had the streets blocked off by the feds
I was cookin' dope in the frying pan
The same pan I used to fry spam
When I was broke, I couldn't find damn
So when the money came I was fine, damn
Them Seminary niggas made mans
Cartis on, no Ray Bans
Pulled up in a gray Benz
Black hoodie on and some gray Timbs
'Bout a hundred niggas ready to slide through your block on my clock
One phone call, have them young niggas come clean up with the mops
They silde through my block, I'm up top with them rocks
Servin' all them knots, hit that lot for that drop
Killzone on my nigga neck, chopper boy like my nigga Dex
At the bank tryna bust a check, five-oh behind us, bitch bust a left
Ain't too many real niggas left
Diamonds on me real, you can test
I was really drilling for the set
Money good, nigga place a bet, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Dex Osama]
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh

[Verse 3: DameDot]
Feelin' like a made man
No haircut, lookin' like a caveman
Yeah, fuck a barber, nigga we shave grams
Cut, hit a nigga block like the raid vans
Nigga got beef with Teezy, beef with me
Hard dicks on the decks, he'll shoot for me (hello?)
Nigga got bands, we just want the deals
Niggas got watches, we just want the mils
Niggas got chains, we just want the thrill
The bitch got the bag, she just want the heels
Niggas got K's, we just want the M's
Lay your ass down for real

[Chorus: Dex Osama]
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man, huh
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
Bitch I'm feelin' like a made man
Put in work, I'm a made man, huh
