[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yee]
I put a chopper by my door, yeah, and I swear
I'll never call the law, man
See sometimes these thoughts cross my mind, I'm thinkin' of homicide
To my left and my right, I got killers on my side
I don't play both sides, that's some shit I don't
Murder's all she wrote, that was just a quote
I just need an estimate and I can get 'em gone
Send 'em to your residence, they sleepin' on your home
I get you hurt, if I said that, I mean it
I got a strategy, movin' strategic
We tryna ambush in all of your people
You play us pussy, we comin' to see you
Bitch got me fucked up, thinkin' I lucked up
Bitch I deserve it
Givin' my vision, my people a purpose
Stay down and stay loyal, I promise it's worth it

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door, yeah

[Verse 2: Prezi]
I'm knowin' where I come from, most of this shit is new to me
Nigga doin' better, ain't goin' back where I used to be
Bitches chosin' me, now these bitches tryna get loose for me
Gave my dogs my vision, how niggas can't see what I can see
Been that nigga for awhile now, we was built to never bow down
Got a couple pits I need freed up out that dog pound
Brother told me to watch niggas, everybody don't rock with you
Same school, same class, but trust me we is not niggas
Run around with a pole on me
Catch a body, got a soul on me
Some of the niggas that I call homie
Be the same niggas that'll roll on me
Never felt the pain that I endured
Never took the trips that I explored
Give enough, they ask for more
Ship sailed, nigga all aboard

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door
Givin' my vision to us all, you not built like us
You can have it and lose it all, how you built that up
How we livin' like no tomorrow, you can feel that rush
I put my back against the wall, and a chopper by my door, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
