June onna beat, June onna beat

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
Shoulda known better not to hit that bitch
Me and that nigga been lock since kids
Ain't that a bitch? Why the fuck did he switch?
Couldn't play ball but I could cook me a big
Couldn't cut grass but I could cut me a nik'
Knew times was hard when I had to pay rent
Shoulda known better yeah way back then
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
Shoulda known better not to hit that bitch
Me and that nigga been lock since kids
Ain't that a bitch? Why the fuck did he switch?
Couldn't play ball but I could cook me a big
It's Philthy nigga
Couldn't cut grass but I could cut me a nik', (uh huh)
Knew times was hard when I had to pay rent, (look)
Shoulda known better yeah way back then, (look)

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Shoulda known better not to trust that bitch (that bitch)
Tell she a freak how she suck that dick (that dick)
I was in the kitchen when I bust that brick (that brick)
I was at the jeweler when I bust my wrist (my wrist)
Momma always told me that them niggas wasn't shit (wasn't shit)
But I was hard-headed, didn't listen to shit (listen to shit)
When you get money closest niggas to you switch (switch)
S-14 bricks, Su off mitts (off mitts)
What the next man eat don't make me shit (shit)
Every jeweler in the game wanna make my shit (my shit)
Every pimp in the game wanna knock my bitch (my bitch)
When you got your money up you can talk like this (like this)
I made all the dope boys wanna be pimps (be pimps)
Bishop was a dope by before he was a pimp (was a pimp)
You hang wit' all broke boys you'll be the tent (be the tent)
Pussy nigga insecure in his own skin (own skin)
Bitch should only wear red bottoms when she on her period (on her period)
Feet in pussy bleeding man this shit serious (serious)
Young fly rich nigga no need for a mirror (for a mirror)
How I'm getting' money got these pussy niggas curious (niggas curious)
Me and that nigga been locked since kids (since kids)
When he was locked up I took care of his kids (his kids)
Three way calls on the phone wit' his bitch (his bitch)
But when he hung up she was tryna suck dick (suck dick)

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
Shoulda known better not to hit that bitch
Me and that nigga been lock since kids
Ain't that a bitch? Why the fuck did he switch?

[Verse 2: Trapboy Freddy]
Shoulda known better yeah way back then
We was breakin' down bigs, we was just some little kids
Jumped off the porch young at a early age
Everybody trappin' out the 'partment no cave
Couldn't make A's but could make me a big
I knew I couldn't drive, I just wanted that Benz
Don't make money then it don't make sense
I'm tryna make money I ain't makin' no friends
Momma told me then I'd have fake friends
Guess back then it just didn't make sense
Knew I wanted a Rover I ain't know I was gon' get it
Bust down a brick and I bought if off fifty's
'Member them nights that we slept in them trenches ('member?)
'Member them night that we busted them niggas ('member?)
'Member them night we had worked in our dentals
'Member that brick that we bust down to nickels
Been two years since they popped my nigga
Been two years since I called my sister
Remember when we was broke so we took them cookies
Made it to the 'partments and we started back joogin'
Same clothes all month, trap house hustlin'
Sam robbed his patna so sometime he don't trust him
She know I'm a dog but she say that she love me
I done so much shit sometimes I don't trust me

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
Shoulda known better not to hit that bitch
Me and that nigga been lock since kids
Ain't that a bitch? Why the fuck did he switch?
Couldn't play ball but I could cook me a big
Couldn't cut grass but I could cut me a nik'
Knew times was hard when I had to pay rent
Shoulda known better yeah way back then
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
Shoulda known better not to hit that bitch
Me and that nigga been lock since kids
Ain't that a bitch? Why the fuck did he switch?
Couldn't play ball but I could cook me a big (yeah)
Couldn't cut grass but I could cut me a nik' (yeah)
Knew times was hard when I had to pay rent
Shoulda known better yeah way back then

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
That was my nigga since we was like eleven
Gleek 32 only hold like seven
Told on the homie nigga still gotta eleven
Rat tendencies nigga shoulda known better
Shout out to the bitches that ain't never send a letter
'Fore I went down, wasn't me and you together? Huh?
Bitches catted off on a fella (I said them bitches catted off on a fella)
Shoulda know better but a nigga do now
Disloyalty get a nigga blew down
Put some money on his head when I run through these pounds (yeah)
They gon' throw a whole lot of rounds (yeah)
I be ducked off out of town
Tryna make somethin' shake
Thirty thou' on the play
And if the homey get hit then it's back to the hood
'Cause I know bruh countin' on the gang
I ain't change up niggas know what I bang
I don't do this shit for the fame
I was countin' on the yeak when I landed in ya city
Nigga you ain't never bring me no thang (no than)
And I still showed love to the J's (uh huh)
Ayne want a dime for the 8
Yeah I ain't even got it, here go a couple dollas
Ayne I'm just tryna make sure that you straight

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]

[Verse 4: Yella Beezy]
Ayy Yella mayne

Same ol' chain, wit' the same ol' bezel
Some of these niggas on the same ol' level
Fuck the same ol' hoes on the same ol' schedule
Yella jumped out the womb bitch a young go getta
Fuckin' with the same nigga you must don't want no betta
You niggas ain't tryna hustle must don't want no chedda
Ain't a hood I can't go nigga don't know Yella
Said I shoulda known better, to fuck that bitch
All the ho wanna do now is suck my dick
Love the way the big face Rolly hug my wrist
My nigga just got locked, I told cuz don't trip
Boy just sit still, I told cuz don't switch
Said it's just a little time, say cuz don't flip
Damn near broke my heart to say cuz ain't stiff
My nigga always used to say, aye cuz ain't built
Nigga bumpin' (?) gone boss
Get ya ass knocked out, boy I'm a top boss
Nigga hold one knee nigga just like top dog
Tryna get my rocks off, bitch blew my socks off
Met her out in rockwall, call the bitch lockjaw
Nigga we got boil, nigga we got soft
Boy I been havin' paper way before I popped off
Actin too gangsta nigga cut a Nike top off

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
Shoulda known better not to hit that lick
