[Verse 1: Team Eastside Peezy]
Hit the club, thirty minutes, left with two bitches, nigga that's some real shit
I ain't give them hoes a dime made 'em pay me, nigga that's a real pimp
I'll fuck a nigga baby mama and don't feel sorry, not a little bit
Sippin' dirty pineapple Fanta, got me so sleep that I don't feel shit
RIP my nigga J-Bo, RIP my nigga Nef ho
Rest in peace to Auntie Portland nigga, she taught a nigga how to sell dope
Feds listen to everything we say, nigga I ain't talkin' on the cellphone
Judge gave my nigga thirty-five, he was in his twenties, that's a red road
I ain't fuckin' with you rat niggas, I ain't think about no pussy either
I be in the streets every day, a nigga ain't gon' mush me or push me either
I'm a real stand-up nigga, you be on your knees, you a pussy eater
Sold thirty pints less than ten minutes, came right back, niggas couldn't believe it

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
This is all ways of thirty-seven
Amiri jeans, I don't need a belt
Grocery shopping in the wick line
Used to pray to God that the cheese would melt
Thirty pointers in the diamond chain
Couple carats in the diamond ring
Had to cut your phone out of range
I ain't get the text, I ain't hear it ring
New field playin' this shit, new niggas playin' this street
VS1's in a nigga teeth, F & Co. made it, you can ask G
Brooklyn bitch got some good pussy, ten K if you wanna book me
Backwood full of killzone, gelato fire, not no cookie
Detail on a new foreign, road runner, pull up on me when I call
Oh 2018 your year? we gon' see how many of you niggas ball
Versace boxers all on my ass, every day of the week got a new color
Red seats, white Bentley truck, been thinkin' about paintin' it a new color, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos

[Verse 3: Cash Click Boog]
Forty block and Ventraro, them my blocks since a day old
Sold blocks on the same block, been stackin' up legos
Keep shooters on stand-by, they shoot when I say so
Stretch dog with the fentanyl, stretch lean with the Karo
Big dog, that's all, fuckin' off, we don't save hoes
Mac and cheese with the drumstick, we'll mash your potato
Nigga talkin' 'bout attempted murder, lil dog we don't claim those
Doin' drills in the same car, the same gun, the same clothes
All I wanted was a Maybach, all I wanted was an AP
Compare you to Denzel, compare me to Jay-Z
I don't need niggas around me, still me when I'm in deep
Quarter nine on a twenty ounce, I'm surprised that I ain't sleep

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos

[Verse 4: Rockin Rolla]
Pulled up with the Cash Click, bounced out, act an A-hole
Bad bitch just cashed in, look like ten out of A-hole
Ballin' hard like Kyrie, fade away on these fake hoes
Lookin' for a brick of lean nigga, better not be Karo
My lil bros move me, 'bout me they take your face off
Me and Boog finna take off, hard work but it paid off
Go against the grain, them choppers bang, get you whacked like Adolf
We ain't takin' no days off, we gon' ball like the playoffs
My wrist on skate, pull up i8
Tucked behind these dark tints, you can't see my face
My bitch body's like J-Lo's, look at her waist
Overlapping these broke niggas, come join this race, ayy

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos
I ain't lyin' 'bout no pussy niggas, I ain't sweatin' no fake hoes
All I want is an i8, an AP, and a bankroll
Your bitch like Shanaynay, my bitch like J-Lo
Pullin' up with the Stinc Team, bouncin' out with them dracos
