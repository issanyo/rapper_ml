[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
This year I got some big shit off my bucket list
Walk in my shoes, I bet you couldn't live up to this
Videos like a hockey game, all these icy sticks
I'm just sayin', I'm beefin' with your mans then you might get hit
What's this shit I'm hearin', niggas tryna get buried
With this rocket I start shootin' like I'm Brent Barry
Put some money on your kids like the tooth fairy
You ain't ready for this shit, boy you too scary
Since I been droppin' all these niggas' hoes been actin' different
I got a package, you just know me from this rappin' nigga
If I gotta act up, it's a wrap for niggas
'Cause I got them toys with me, it ain't action figures
Did it in months, name a nigga that could
Looked out for you, name a nigga that would
It's in my genes nigga, I ain't gotta act hood
They payin' me that cheese nigga 'cause my craft good

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
DZ sold out the complex
Growin' up, had a little man complex
Baby mama keep sendin' dumb threats
But I ain't trippin', we don't answer one text
Last year made a million, I can confess
Had to get that off my chest, I been dumb stressed
A nigga play with me, we make a dumb mess
Had to cut them suckers off, that was one less
Nigga get knocked down and we the suspect
Talkin' all that tough shit on the internet
See real niggas, we ain't really into that
Runnin' off at the mouth'll get your ceiling cracked
This chopper hit your ass, won't get your feeling back
Signed to the streets with no deal attached
Rap ain't workin', back to dealing crack
Couple pounds of gelato, gotta send the pack, it's Philthy

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'

[Verse 3: Cookie Money]
I'm a B Street nigga, eighty on my wrist
And I ain't get it off rap, I got it off the bitch
Ten bands up in Barneys, got it off the brick
Bust your bitch wide open, make her do the splits
Payed cash for this Ghost, bitch no rentals
Gold Forgis got these pussy niggas in they feelings
All my niggas tote thirties, all my niggas drillin'
We ain't runnin' from no smoke, all my niggas killin'
We gotta shoot everybody, we can't leave no witness
Got no love for these hoes, we even shootin' bitches
Mob ties so I die when it come to business
Streets made my heart cold, I ain't got no feelings
Rest in peace to my pops, a real fuckin' legend
He done had a golden child, a real fuckin' blessing
I know he love to see my ball while he smile in heaven
Fuckin' hoes and doin' shows all the way to Texas

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'
Bet I could get these niggas in they feelings
Bet I could get these bitches in they feelings
Bet if I pull up in that bitch and it ain't got no ceiling
Bet if I pull up with your bitch, we wasn't just chillin'
