(2Pac Speech)

[Verse 1]
It's Philthy nigga
Look
I say them niggas want me dead so i keep the hammer on me (I got it)
They was talking to the feds they want me in the slammer homie (that's right)
No victim of a crime money when them niggas shot me (uh uh)
Had ten thousand in my pocket when them niggas shot me (I did)
They know that I'm a threat so they wanna leave me wet (they do)
They couldn't get the job done so I know that they upset (I know that man)
If I decide to stop rappin' I can hit the block (I can hit the block)
If you decide to stop rappin' you couldn't sell a block (It's Philthy)
When niggas yell hit the bell one coming out
Patiently waiting on that album when its coming out (never)
Throw in the towel nigga you can't afford the beef (broke nigga)
I've been slidin' all week I can't afford to sleep (uh uh)
I'll never switch sides the clip still inside
You niggas really pussy I can see the bitch inside (pussy)
They askin' if im Livewire because im on fire (I'm on fire)
Them my niggas for life behind them I'll do life

(Mac Dre Speech)

[Verse 2]
I got some niggas locked up that's never coming home (I do)
I remember being outside and never coming home (I do)
Broke and dirty but now I can give you a loan (you a loan)
Funk or Die album still screamin out free Moe (free Moe)
That was 08' you niggas caught the flow late (flow late)
Jumped on the bandwagon on the block pants sagging (Trues)
The hardest nigga since Pac and Dre (I am)
If they was alive you other niggas wouldn't be in the way
You ain't gotta be a lyricist to keep it real (uh uh)
I can't relate to what they sayin' I'ma keep it real (keep it real)
Before I ever held the mic nigga I held the steel (I did)
And if I had to pull that bitch nigga I aim to kill (it's Philthy)
I'm in here statin' facts if that's what you're lookin' for
The recipe to bring it back if that's what you're cookin' for (I got it)
A-one no soda you never seen a quota (uh uh)
And before I die I'll be looking over my shoulder
