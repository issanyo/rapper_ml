[Chorus: Money Man]
I'm dead fresh, fuck a cemetery
Leave a nigga an obituary
Shit is graphic, not fictionary
Me and money went and got married
Rock Versace like I'm gettin' sponsored
Muscled up, I ain't have a sponsor
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
You know what that stick could do to you?
You know what the brick can do for you?
You know what them pounds can do for you, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I don't get mad, I get motivated
Real nigga way before the paper
In they face you can see the hatred
'Cause a real nigga finally made it
Couple million in diamonds on me
Feds wasn't up from rhymin' on it
At the top, yeah it's kinda lonely
But I come from Top Ramen homie
Take it out the wrapper and bust it down
Tell the jeweler go'n bust it down
What it cost me, like fifty thou
Hit the lot with two-fifty now
All my niggas, yeah they eatin' with me
But they used to be starvin' with me
Nowadays you can't bargain with me
In a foreign car with the carbon with me
Look happiness is priceless
Off the head, you can't type this
In a two door, bitch you might fit
Two Asian hoes and a white bitch
Made a million off rap last year
Told the bitch you can't crash here
Told the bitch you need a papsmear
Pussy smell like last year, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Money Man]
I'm dead fresh, fuck a cemetery
Leave a nigga an obituary
Shit is graphic, not fictionary
Me and money went and got married
Rock Versace like I'm gettin' sponsored
Muscled up, I ain't have a sponsor
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
You know what that stick could do to you?
You know what the brick can do for you?
You know what them pounds can do for you, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it

[Verse 2: Money Man]
Rockin' jewelry like I own a mine
Bought a Rollie, I'ma wear a time
Lil shawty bad, goddamn she fine
I smoke the strongest gas you can find
I'm the freshest nigga you ever seen
I'm a boss, gotta feed the team
Made a million dollars from the green
Shawty said she gonna fuck me good
We was sellin' P's in the hood
Tryna limit, boy I wish you would
Fuck around and have you gone for good
Fuck around and throw a whole hundred on 'em
Fuck these niggas, I ain't sparing none of them
I'm with Philthy in the Bay nigga
Hundred rounds, who want to play nigga?
Middle man, you in the way nigga
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
Ten racks nigga, in each pocket
Designer fillin' up a nigga's closet
Had to leave a nigga unconcious
My niggas killer, they ain't got a conscious
We ride around, nigga with them rockets
I know a plug in every single state

[Chorus: Money Man]
I'm dead fresh, fuck a cemetery
Leave a nigga an obituary
Shit is graphic, not fictionary
Me and money went and got married
Rock Versace like I'm gettin' sponsored
Muscled up, I ain't have a sponsor
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
You know what that stick could do to you?
You know what the brick can do for you?
You know what them pounds can do for you, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
She the baddest, lil shawty got it, ooh
She gon' shake that ass then drop it
