[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Ooooo Ciabatta Ciabatta cheese
Rolex on my fucking sleeve i got a bitch that speak japenese
She sleep with panda bears in the trees
My baby stay far she ain't close to me
But she facetime with them groceries
Overseas [?]
Baby be making that Yen showing me off to her friends
Showing me off in my benz
Showing me splashing these diamonds talking shit with twin
Never thought id have my freedom again
Violated with my P.O again
Caught me with a pistol sellin a bitch
Rather catch a case than be in a ditch, yeahh
Thats just the way that it is, thats just the way that we live
I pour that syrup to feel
I shoot that pistol for thrill
I make ciabatta foreal
I put them diamonds in gold wet like a seal
I drip my city foreal
Everybody buy pieces because they wanna be us
But there diamonds not clear

[Chorus: Sauce Walka]
I make that bread like nothing [X4]
I make ciabatta i make that gwop
I make that cheese I make that cash
I make that stash I make that Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeh
I make that bread i make that bread
I make that cheese Rolex my sleeve
I make that bread like nothing[x3]
I make that bread
