[Intro: Lil Aj]
We keep them drummies on that dumb shit

[Verse 1: Lil Aj]
We keep them drummies on that dumb shit
My niggas sippin bo and snortin just for fun bitch
Yeah, me, I play the background
Any nigga run up, I swear he get the mac round
I never back down, ask them sucka niggas
Every time I slid threw, bare face busting nigga
Rest in peace [?], imma keep it lit
I swear me alone, I done did about ten skits
I fuck wit big [?], he gone go for me
When I was like 8 months, he had a little snow bunny
I fuck with RU, when I was down he shot me some clams
Brother like a mother fucker
Touch him imma fucking bust ya
I ain't sneak dissing I'm just rapping nigga
Feel the froggish leap
If you do, I be taxing niggas

[Verse 2: Joe blow]
Ay, pimping like I'm [?] man, when I'm at the show tonight
4 bunnies with me, I'm predicting that it snow tonight
Youngsters they don't value life
Putting cash over Christ
Last lash I had I used the mask from the poltergeist
Through a four up in my sprite
Before I hopped up on the flight, non stop to N.Y
Just to re-up on some ice
Custom artist record piece form [?] only cost a dime
Every time you think about the mob I better cross your mind
I'm paper chasing every day it run across my mind
Better protect your ice with your life, its what it cost to shine
A young bridge burner, all I do is cross the line
Black clicker, pocket 95, shit I ain't hard to find

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
50,000 on the One Mob piece
Just copped a Wraith Only drive 2 times of the week
These red bottoms on my feet 2,000 at least
And I'm still good on every block on my street
I'm still sliding for the beef suckers want me to sees
But behind closed doors he really wanted deceased
Rat fax putting these sucker niggas on mac blast
Free Mac Blast, and R.I.P the wheezy f. Mac and can't forget Chad
If ain't outside when we slide then we gone double back
And thats a blocked Calls on my line cause I can't call him back
D.A. turned to wars Jay Bay
Funk or die to death haller free  Jay Bay
Yeah it's philthy nigga

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
All we know is crime
All my family doing time
My shooter follow though with every murder, that's a sign
If homie bail out and skip town, then that's a sign
The paper work the surface, just give it a little time
Phone call declined I don't conversate with rodents
Hell gang life forever. Killers cause commotion
Consider we be tripping if you intend to approach us
Pull up at your momma's residents like Jehovah
And he still a smoker, I can't even blame him cause I'm in the same boat, searching for a savior
[Twist his body parts like yoga with S Kada
My associates is gangsters, favor for a favor

[Verse 2: Lil Blood]
Favor for a favor my nigga come take a ride for me
Hold up, don't jump in this car if you won't die for me
Never testify on me, look me in the eyes homie, I can see you pussy get the fuck up out my ride homie
Couple niggas plotting on me, talking bout sliding on me
Try me, think I'm pussy? Pussy boy I keep the fire on me
Know some niggas rocking for me
3rd world rocking for me
Taliban Rocking for me
Lash money rocking for me
Own fam switching on me, them niggas fake ass fuck
Them niggas on some dick riding shit, Get off that niggas nuts
I don't need a nigga for shit I bust my own guns
Keep running around like you sick, going to give your dome bust

[outro: Lil Blood]
My granny used to tell me, "Nigga you live by the sword, you gone die by the sword." Nigga, you need to stop ripping and running these streets. These niggas don't like you. These niggas ain't your friends. They pretend to be, but they really ain't
