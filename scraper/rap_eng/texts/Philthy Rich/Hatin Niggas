[Intro: Cash Click Boog]
Look me in my face

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I swear I hate niggas, I hate niggas like a motherfucker
Fake niggas like a motherfucker, look me in my face
Look through these karate frames I can see this hate
It don't matter 'cause it's money in the safe, why they mad?
I did it on my own, why they mad?
Ain't nobody put me on, why they mad?
GMC, we too busy gettin' cash
They just mad 'cause I'm runnin' up a bag

[Verse 1: Cash Click Boog]
Why they hatin' on me? they hatin' on me 'cause they not me
I hate niggas like a Nazi
Get that bag, I can't let nobody stop me
Disrespect and we gon' rock 'em, that's real talk
It ain't never been a thing to let that steel talk
Syrup, ain't no Smirnoff, pints, pop the seal off
You ain't never hustled if you never took a real loss
Trappin', I ain't got no time to chill dog, make it count
Blower on me, I can't let these niggas play me out
Bands in my PRP's, bands in my bank account
I'm still lookin' at my daughter, got me blankin' out
I gotta get us out the hood, that's all I think about
I keep a shooter, he gon' shoot it if he take it out
Sleepin' bags, yellow crime scene, tape him out
I know some niggas that ain't make it out
That's why it's on me, I can't never go a day without
I talk it like I walk it, play it like I say it
But we gettin' money nigga, get that through your head
Cash Click, more problems, more bread
Keep your plate pussy, we already fed, hatin' nigga

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I swear I hate niggas, I hate niggas like a motherfucker
Fake niggas like a motherfucker, look me in my face
Look through these karate frames I can see this hate
It don't matter 'cause it's money in the safe, why they mad?
I did it on my own, why they mad?
Ain't nobody put me on, why they mad?
GMC, we too busy gettin' cash
They just mad 'cause I'm runnin' up a bag

[Verse 2: Cash Click Boog]
I ain't never dropped no dime, why they mad?
Went to jail and did my time, why they mad?
That's why I hate niggas
Why you hatin', you a fake nigga
And fake niggas fuck with fake niggas
I got some shooters in the hole that ain't gon' play with you
And if your niggas got your back then they can lay with you
Got my block pimpin' like AZ, ballin' like Jay-Z
And you be switchin' teams like KD
All this money in my pocket look crazy
Cash Click shit, Army and Navy, gettin' stupid cash
Every time they send them bales in, we move 'em fast
Quit hating and go get a bag with your Boosie ass
Still thinkin' 'bout them times when I was doin' bad
Broke and I ain't have a dime, I ain't know who to ask
Now I do the Ballys belt with the shoes to match
Me and Sal walkin' out of Saks, we just blew a bag
On mamas I'm gettin' guap, on mamas I got it locked
On everything I'm a lick, I promise it's one up top
Sold out, it's gonna throw some fifty pointers in the watch
Never bummin', we be spendin' hella money, fuck the opps

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I swear I hate niggas, I hate niggas like a motherfucker
Fake niggas like a motherfucker, look me in my face
Look through these karate frames I can see this hate
It don't matter 'cause it's money in the safe, why they mad?
I did it on my own, why they mad?
Ain't nobody put me on, why they mad?
GMC, we too busy gettin' cash
They just mad 'cause I'm runnin' up a bag

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
I say I'm runnin' up a bag, you just runnin' up a check
You better pay them people 'fore they repo his jet
Stop speakin' on the past and all the shit you used to have
Bitch I'm ballin' right now, a hundred thousand, all cash
Salute to Cash Click, bitch I'm in the fast whip
Fresh off the lot, paper tags and manuscripts
All these foreigns in my garage, look like I manufacture whips
Niggas love you when you broke and then they hate you when you rich
Sem City in this bitch, a hundred thousand on my wrist
I was really in them trenches, public housing in the rich
Yeah this cheese for police, want a nigga off the streets
All I did was motivate niggas to get up off the streets
Money on the table, endorsmenets from Cookies and Strideline
They just want a nigga sittin' on the sideline
Before you sign a deal you better read the fine line
For a broke bitch, I could never find time
Any nigga out of Oakland, I bet I motivate 'em
And if that nigga ain't feelin' me then he just a hater
See I was locked up in Elmwood with D-Boy
A lot of niggas be pussy, no they ain't street boy

[Chorus: Cash Click Boog]
I swear I hate niggas, I hate niggas like a motherfucker
Fake niggas like a motherfucker, look me in my face
Look through these karate frames I can see this hate
It don't matter 'cause it's money in the safe, why they mad?
I did it on my own, why they mad?
Ain't nobody put me on, why they mad?
GMC, we too busy gettin' cash
They just mad 'cause I'm runnin' up a bag
