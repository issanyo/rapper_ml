Oh you mad cause I'm styling on 'em?
You mad cause I'm styling on 'em?

[Verse 1: Joe Blow]
Uh, what's happnin'?
Aight
I threw a Four up in my big blue
I don't give a shit bitch, I know you sip too
S63 with AMG when I zip through
And I don' smoked about a zip too
Hoping I don't OD, smokin' all this OG
Sippin' on this codeine, hanging on Morphines
Hoe please stop bumpin' your gums
I'm off this Perc 30 and its 30 up in my guns, shit
I'm eatin' shrooms popping OxyContin
Kissin' on this lean, straigh, straight, got me noddin'
Off these downers, so down that you's my only option
To get high with us you know you got to be mobbin'
I'm off this syrup I just gotta have it
They call me blow so you know I gotta powder habit
Stevie Joe and Joe Blow, we are not you're average
And when it comes down to drugs nigga I'm an addict

[Chorus]
I know, I'm right back where I was before
But I'm not alone, you said take my hand
And we go, and we go
And I hope, that we don't overdose cause we don't
No we don't, ever know
When we have had enough
I know, and we go, and we go
And I hope that we don't overdose cause we don't, No we don't Ever know when we have had enough

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]

I'ma overdose of this money nigga

Codeine got me thinkin' 'bout my Co-D's
Niggas out in two weeks but parolees
Young niggas where I'm from you can't control these
They'd rather have a hot head than cold feet
Thinkin' 'bout this house lick that went bad
A couple niggas made the news, a couple shit bags
Tryna' count a hundred thousand in new hundreds
If you ain't seen us pull up I ain't loose nothin'
Four foreigns up on these broke niggas
If you ain't havin' no money take notes nigga
Everything designer that I be rockin'
So everything that I be buyin' nigga you gon' be copying
Cuban Link and Yachtmaster, I get money fast
Philthy fresh 2, this a fuckin' classic
Dougie stuffed the kush all in the wrapper
A couple thousand in ice I'm thuggin' in the trap

[Chorus]
I know, I'm right back where I was before
But I'm not alone, you said take my hand
And we go, and we go
And I hope, that we don't overdose cause we don't
No we don't, ever know
When we have had enough
I know, and we go, and we go
I hope that we don't overdose cause we don't, No we don't Ever know when we have had enough

[Verse 3: Stevie Joe]
Seatbelt's fastened, we gon' do the dash
Out of town off downers still movin' fast
Fucked around, smoked a pound running through the pack
Give me that ac one liter, I'll throw a Two in that
Though life is so precious we still test it
Ingesting different drugs, looking real reckless
I might be one pint away from an early grave
Minding the days, been high since an early age
If you only live once then fuck it, I'm going in
And if loosing's not an option then fuck it, I'm gon' win
High as I be, with my eyes open
I sleep when I'm dead, I'ma ride till the end
Still sip, hoping that I don't slip
Got health problems and promised Mom I was gon' quit
Life's still a bitch, got me grippin' that Four Fifth
So I'm pimping on that hoe, tryna' get what I'm gon' get

[Chorus]
I know, I'm right back where I was before
But I'm not alone, you said take my hand
And we go, and we go
And I hope, that we don't overdose cause we don't
No we don't, ever know
When we have had enough
I know, and we go, and we go
I hope that we don't overdose cause we don't, No we don't Ever know when we have had enough
