[Hook: Derek King]
Oh baby run these bands up
You calling for this cash, better answer
Talking like you want this bag huh?
Well show me something I won’t pass up
Cash in my wallet, tired niggas speaking on my pockets
Why I gotta find it if I got it, no time if you ain’t making deposits

[Verse 1: KiingRod]
Why you worried about me but not running a check
Soft ten bands on my fit got you wet
Back to back foreigns, 2 hunnid to the floor
When we slidin’ to your city, better tuck your new hoe
Bands in the safe, god damn watch it grow
Why yo mans got a job, god damn let him go
Broke ass niggas won’t ever keep yo hoe
When I drive down the block with these new Lambo doors
Feeling Rockstar, slappin’ new Post Malone
Up in Hollywood Hills with the gang, not alone
Cookies to the face, still dreaming of that Wraith
Ima bust down a Rolie when this check his my face
Running up a check, steady touching new steak
Blue hunnids at her ass got me eating hella steak
Crazy in the head, just trying to keep it straight
But she know what to do, I keep my bitch in her place

Oh baby run these bands up
You calling for this cash, better answer
Talking like you want this bag huh?
Well show me something I won’t pass up
Cash in my wallet, tired niggas speaking on my pockets
(Aye it’s Philthy nigga) Why I gotta find it if I got it, no time if you ain’t making deposits

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Niggas ain’t solid, bitches ain’t loyal
He might got a Rolie on, but he ain’t royal
Bust down grill, no this ain’t foil
Sippin [?] no that ain’t oil
The engine on the scraper in the blue coil
Train is slipping and it ran out of oil
If you in the streets, get some life insurance
Niggas playing for keeps if you liking this [?]
I’m really from the east, don’t slide through if you nervous
See, I promote peace, but if you trippin’, it’s murder
Free all my niggas locked up, fighting the murder
Put a body down, and get ready to burn em
Good looking out put your nigga on a lick or two
She buggin out, that’s what the dick’ll do
To be real, I regret putting my dick in you
I did the best that I can by uplifting you

Oh baby run these bands up
You calling for this cash, better answer
Talking like you want this bag huh?
Well show me something I won’t pass up
Cash in my wallet, tired niggas speaking on my pockets
Why I gotta find it if I got it, no time if you ain’t making deposits
