But these guns go retarded
Been in the hood all my life

Seminary had made me, and Mom had raised me
I could never be a pussy or let no nigga play me
Looked up to Jodi and Mane, [?], hung around [?] and [?], Rel and Wayne, De'Andre
So when you speak on his name
Just know it come with gunplay
I don't take this shit lightly
My niggas fighting indictment
See, don't get it confused cause I could fuck up your day
Five-hundred dollar MoneyPak will get it done today
Free OG Tim-[?]

These niggas run to the Quran

The more money I make, the less I'm around
Now they saying I'm fake and I ain't from the town
You on the wrong side the street

Shouts out to [?] and free [?], if [?] was around [?] wouldn't have made it out
See, I'mma keep it a hundred until they take me out
Fake niggas around, cause real niggas is down
Oh Yeah, shout out to Stone, a real nigga came home

Closed casket, your funeral preacher sing on your interludes
