J Fresh

[Chorus: Slimmy B]
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me
A downfall is what they pray up on me
So I keep this 'K up on me
All these chains, they gon' stay up on me
Niggas hatin' everyday on me
Own family changed on me
Couple niggas turned snake on me
Never let a nigga take from me
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me (aye it's Philthy nigga)
A downfall is what they pray up on me (ahh look)
So I keep this 'K up on me, nigga

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
If you see I cut 'em off that mean that he was flaw (pussy)
I remember PG&E cut the heater off (oh I remember)
I cried at the birthday party that Dede gave me (swear to God)
The first birthday party I ever had since a baby (it's Philthy)
Ain't have my own room until I got my own house (dat right)
My ex bitch caught me cheatin' and kicked my ass out (bitch)
Niggas talkin' beef but dry snitchin' on the net (suckas)
Pressure bust pipes, but nigga don't get yo' ass wet (Philthy)
I'm from Seminary lil' nigga you can go and check (Seminary)
Pull up wit' that dumb shit you get yo' ass stretched (you will)
The 'K got a hundred rounds, you better stay down (a hunnid on it)
I'm at rainbow shootin' threes on the playground (swish)
Man them bitches don't love me like they say they love me (uh uh)
She left a nigga for dry when that shit got ugly (faggot)
Rest in peace Feddy, free JBAY (free JBAY)
All VVS stones in this gate gate

[Chorus: Slimmy B]
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me
A downfall is what they pray up on me
So I keep this 'K up on me
All these chains, they gon' stay up on me
Niggas hatin' everyday on me
Own family changed on me
Couple niggas turned snake on me
Never let a nigga take from me
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me
A downfall is what they pray up on me
So I keep this 'K up on me, nigga

[Verse 2: Slimmy B]
Niggas want me in the ground (nigga)
Niggas wanna see me down (nigga)
Rent fourty thou' (nigga)
Young nigga runnin' wild (uh)
Never been a bitch ever since I was a child (ever since I was a child)
Blowin on this Cookie got a nigga in the clouds
Used to make my momma frown
Now I make my momma proud (yeah I do)
It hurts, she ain't get to see me in that cap and gown (yeah it did)
Was on the road to being broke, had to turn my life around
Now a couple hundred thou' sittin' in my bank account
Fake niggas in my face
Feds tryna build a case (build a case)
In my hood it ain't safe (it ain't safe)
Niggas run around wit' 'K's (wit' 'K's)
'Member I was broke for days
Kickin' doors for that cake
Pullin' skits broad day
Bouncin' out wit' that drake (boom boom)
In my heart I got hate
In my mind got revenge (yeah)
Tears fell when I had Tutu's casket in my hands (in my hands)
Take a knee and ask why God, why you take my mans? (why you take my mans)
And when I catch whoever did it
He gon' die that's on my kid

[Chorus: Slimmy B]
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me
A downfall is what they pray up on me
So I keep this 'K up on me
All these chains, they gon' stay up on me
Niggas hatin' everyday on me
Own family changed on me
Couple niggas turned snake on me
Never let a nigga take from me
They don't love me like they say they love me
Niggas ain't on me like they say they on me
A downfall is what they pray up on me
So I keep this 'K up on me
Nigga!
