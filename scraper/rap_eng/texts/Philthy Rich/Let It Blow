One Mob shit
One blood what's happenin

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I say now slide down [?] row in a Bentley on bullshitting (foreign)
Bitch wanted popeyes order me a number 4 bitch (hey do that)
Dreams of the Forbes list maybe one day I see it
Internet thugs tripping maybe one day I see them (pussy)
Glock 27 with the ladder hanging out
Chopper ate his body up now his bladder hanging out
Niggas talking past tense, what they used to have
My city bitch hit the mall before you in the [?] (it's Philthy nigga)
$5,000 Louie bag, I was in the newest Jag
Before you lock in with him you need to check his rat facts (you need to)
Might come back bad, work came back bad
Hit the plug up and told him he need to take this back
Where I'm from it's Baghdad (Seminary)
Chopper make em back back (it will)
Expensive video shoot got 65 up in my backpack (it's blood money)
Caught him in the last trap, shut down my last trap
Out of pocket bitch fagged off with my last trap (it's Philthy nigga)

[Hook: Lil Blood]
We don't know no pussies
We don't fuck with them (we don't know them niggas)
We just move in silence we don't talk on phones (ain't no talking nigga)
We don't do no talking we just let it blow (blat blat)
No we don't do no talking we just let it blow (blat blat)
Bitch you on some broke shit told that bitch to go (bye bitch)

Dropped 30 on this head cause she was talking out
For the bitch he tried to flex so niggas chalked him out

Caught lil daddy at the taco truck and gassed him out

Half a milli on the bill they tried to stick me
Gave my lawyer $20,000 told them try to get me

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
I'm a real nigga and any real nigga will tell ya
I got a tall white bitch that look like Iggy Azalea
In the O they loving blow I'll be remembered a legend
So when I die I'll be as big as Pac, Biggie and Elvis
It's funk or die shit you know that I'mma die funking
Don't be surprised or even cry just go and slide for me
Got a 30 shot ladder and this 9 on me
Soft 20 ball around the neck and another 5 on me
Got this ball bust it down who tryna shoot some pool
You ain't never supposed to shoot for who I shoot for you
I'll shoot for 3rd world blood banga and goof
In LA they having things big things to [?]
My kidneys damn near thro ugh just from drinking juice
See yall tryna cop a brick or two you gotta bring it through
Up in the Bay ask Trae nigga we the truth
And ever since we lost Jack I'm tryna see it through

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
We don't know no pussies we don't fuck with those (nah)
We don't do no woofing on my mother's soul
I been in the trap since I was 6 years old
Had to stay out the kitchen pops was cooking dope (whip it up)
Say that I'm the fellow suckas looking for
Tell them look some more I'm at the liquor store with yicki on me
They know it's body for body is Mozzy breathing on 'em
Niggas got some [?] funk season on me
It ain't peaches in my region gangland geeking
Lifetime commitment to the clique Zillas pledge allegiance
Ain't no secret murders climbing Hell Gang the reason
Broke bitch [?] eat the semen
Jesus my only witness I've never been a witness
Asking for forgiveness I swear I be into drilling niggas
Conversating with these bitches call it pillow snitching
Free my lil niggas doing life you couldn't live with killas

[Verse 5: Lil AJ]
Every 2 months I switch my phone numbers (switch it up)
We don't really talk on phones you know what's going on (uh uh)
Lash money 3rd world ya we in the zone
Keep it lit for them niggas there who ain't coming home (that's my niggas)
Every week I'm back and forth out of town
When I touch in the hood you know we blowing out the pound
I let it blow out the window at a sucka nigga
Ride off laughing talking about how we dust a nigga
Keep it on my hip or under my armpit (ha)
I really got tactics when it come to this mobbing shit (mobbin nigga)
Glock 27, ya that's the pocket rocket
Pop it in a motherfuckers face that be out of pocket
Ya, then we back to the [?] block
45th and Market, better known as Lil [?] spot
Ya, and you know it's money over bitches
Bitches either hoeing or they go in stores sliding visas

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Bruce Banna]
I got my money up, got these broke niggas watching (Banna)
Took a loss on the work so I move cautious (damn)
All this dope around a nigga got me paranoid
If you looking for the drugs hit the android

Heard he fucking with them suckas had to cut his rope (nigga)
Move mean for my niggas gotta give em all

Free [?] niggas already know what's up (niggas know what's up)
You can't hang with my squad you ain't dope as us

Put a 2 in the 20 just to catch my high (syrup)
