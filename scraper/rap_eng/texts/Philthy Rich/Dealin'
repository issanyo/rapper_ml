[Hook: Young Chop]
Buying new [?], I'mma get it
I'mma go cop it then flip it
I'mma go handle my bidness
Got it poppin', I did it
I been pushin' for a minute
You talking money, let's get it
Before the rappin' I was dealin'
(Hottest nigga in my city)

[Verse 1: Young Chop]
Head to toes I'm in all black, I don't gangbang that's a known fact
Hating niggas better fall back, you ain't talkin' money, I don't call back
Niggas thinking that they all that, they're coat stepped on like a door mat
Niggas snitching and its all bad, I'm still in the hood where the dope at
And I been pushin' right before rap, pull a deal in where dough at?
In Houston [?], then Miami [?]
South Beach, ain't do overtime, bend the corner, smoking half a pound
Locked in when we touchdown, them shady boys, they be all around
Got the .45, had the 40 cal, everybody wanna know me now
Nobody never showed me how, I'm just tryna make my whole city proud
Fell in love with this trap shit, I won't give up on this rap shit
Drugs under my mattress, young nigga never had shit

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Ah, the hottest nigga in my city, before the rap when I was dealin'
Actavis in my kidney, foreign cost about fifty
[?] tryna play, VS1s in my diamond chain
Getting head in the [?], [?]
[?], give a fuck what the rest say
Nigga really wanna be like me, can't fuck with me on his best day
I fuck with the 'migos in the hood, I put the kilos up in the hood
I left the foreign thing in the hood, put the trunk up in the hood
Got real blunts [?], play with me - I don't think you should
Got BDs up in Chi Town, [?]
Before you rapped you've never seen the hood, just rappin' 'bout it make it sound good
Got a bad bitch lookin' like Meagan Good giving me everything
And make some good

[Hook: Young Chop]
Buying new [?], I'mma get it
I'mma go cop it then flip it
I'mma go handle my bidness
Got it poppin', I did it
