[Intro]
Funk or Die
This is Jay P Bangz music

[Chorus: Prezi]
It's been a long time comin', I ain't done yet
Been workin' hard, I ain't really had fun yet
Sem City Harbor Road, you know how it go
Competition, seen them we runnin' up the scope
Prezi and success, it go hand in hand
Philthy, he that Sem City money man
Everything presidential, no election neither
Whole lotta dirty money, call it filthy, nigga

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, my Detroit bitch strip with her buffs on
My nigga beat the deputy ass with his cuffs on
I got your baby mama walkin' 'round with nothin' on
Profiles and iPhones tryna cut him off
I told Prezi he need a presi, he gon' bust it down
The hottest nigga in the city and the king of the town
A lotta niggas caught lackin' by lingerin' around
My bitch run the bag up so I'm dickin' her down
Twenty thou' on the pillow, it for JBay
What you know about them "Corrlinks and JPay"?
No, this ain't a day just, this a day-day
Broke bitch a dollar short and a day late

[Chorus: Prezi]
It's been a long time comin', I ain't done yet
Been workin' hard, I ain't really had fun yet
Sem City Harbor Road, you know how it go
Competition, seen them we runnin' up the scope
Prezi and success, it go hand in hand
Philthy, he that Sem City money man
Everything presidential, no election neither
Whole lotta dirty money, call it filthy, nigga

[Verse 2: Prezi]
Ask about me in the streets, my name gold
I prayed for this success but it ain't take long
Got a extension for the rocket like I'm Chris Paul
And I'm a wizard with this bitch like I'm John Wall
With everything that I done did, should I feel illegal?
Got some demons on my shoulders, but I fear no evil
When you got it, they 'posed to have it, imagine that
But when you need it, I guarantee they gon' turn they back
Ooh, bet I started poppin' and it started problems
I got 20 million views, not 20 million dollars
I got three kids and two baby mamas
They stay trippin' 'bout some shit, just let me be a father

[Chorus: Prezi]
It's been a long time comin', I ain't done yet
Been workin' hard, I ain't really had fun yet
Sem City Harbor Road, you know how it go
Competition, seen them we runnin' up the scope
Prezi and success, it go hand in hand
Philthy, he that Sem City money man
Everything presidential, no election neither
Whole lotta dirty money, call it filthy, nigga
