[Intro: Philthy Rich]
Ayy it's Philthy nigga
It's the legion baby
Rest in peace to all my niggas, look

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)

[Verse 1: Prezi]
Stackin' up a check, watchin' how I spend it (Uh-huh)
Everybody pocket watchin', better mind your busines
Heard some rumors 'bout my niggas, they was speakin' bad
But love and loyalty the only thing I ask
Sayin' you real don't impress me, let's just keep it solid (Nah)
Gotta show that you real, that be you niggas' problem
President in my hood way before Obama
Kev died, he got killed ridin' with his mama (Damn)
Shit still hurt, but the hood politics make this shit worse
Shit get crazy when you start winnin'
Ridin' 'round with it, I ain't tryna be a victim (Nah)
I'ma blast first
Pussy he was 14 when he got convicted for a homi (He was)
Told him call me if he need 'em and he know I got it (I do)
I lost some homies to the homies, that shit super phony
Nightmares of my own niggas switchin' on me

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, Lil Phil and Ant can't eat no books (Uh-uh)
So I'm taxin' niggas for these verses and these hooks (Ayy I need that)
You ain't put no money on your nigga's books (Pussy)
And that snitch you runnin' with gettin' overlooked (It's Philthy)
Free Juice, I'm sippin' all this juice (Syrup)
Thinkin' 'bout all the time my niggas gotta do (Is that right?)
Communicatin' with my niggas in the shoe (Huh?)
Send them niggas some pictures, the least you could do (It's Philthy nigga)
Me and Fatts countin' a hundred stacks (A hundred thou)
Last week I scratched off a hundred money packs (Swear to God)
Then passed out eleven hundred backpacks (Is that right?)
You just takin' from the hood, you ain't givin' back (Pussy)
My nigga lost his life, he can't get it back (Uh-uh)
So we slidin' every night until we get him back (Slide)
Shootin' at his top until his ceiling crack (Until his ceiling crack)
Numb to the pain, ain't get my feelin' back (Ain't get my feelin' back)

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)
For my niggas dead and gone, revenge is a promise (Swear to God)
Takin' care my nigga's kids and his mama (Solid)
Presidential nigga, but I don't know Obama (Uh-uh, nigga)
Runnin' through these M's, countin' up these commas (it's Philthy)
