[Skit: M.A.C. Blast]
Happenin', mayne?
M.A.C.-motherfuckin’-B-b-b-last, nigga
Young god built to last, man
Go get them Political Ties and Funk Season 4, man, if you need that starter kit to that izm, mayne
'Cause I ain't goin’ backwards
I'm only goin' forward with this wisdom, mayne
If you don't know
I'm a 100% game member, nigga
That's G-A-M-E member
My bruh Philthy, 100% pushin' the same visual and audio of the same game we standin' on, nigga
The game is all we know, folks
And since we know the game
We know there’s viruses that can affect the game
And one of them fuckin’ viruses is fake love, nigga
Now it's levels to this fake love shit
So please excuse me ’cause this conversation's really way overdue
You know what I'm sayin'?
I might get excited, you know what I’m sayin'?
Now, we gon' start with the seed effect love
The fake love you niggas and bitches got for your motherfuckin' self
And this motherfuckin' culture we stand on, nigga
Fake love is most definitely snitchin'
Since our royal black blood stained these American beaches
Snitchin' has been a fuckin' sin
But when you got fake love for yourself
What you stand on
In this extraordinary culture, hmph
Your love is no longer unconditional, nigga
It becomes weak
Unloyal
You understand?
You be gettin' irrationalized, man
Fake as fuck
Boom, fake love, game over, nigga
You know what I'm sayin'?
With no love for yourself, hmph
You can't have love for your folks
You can't have love for these motherfuckin' streets
Now as you sit in that motherfuckin' room of choices
The homicide room
Where men either build divine character
Or destroy they value system by bowin' down to the slave master's Frankenstein
Your fake love gon' blossom
Until have you tellin' on the Underground Railroad, nigga
And help indict Harriet Tubman, nigga
And Frederick Douglass of the black community today, you bitch
Fake ass nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
Now that's the first level of fake love, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'ma touch on the next level in a future interlude, you know what I'm sayin'?
But until then, nigga
You know what it is, mayne
Sem City in the house, hmph
F.O.D. and Hustlanity, mayne
Where young gods BBS this poetry, mayne
Represent strength and loyalty, mayne
Bap bap!
Nigga, no love before fake love, nigga
You know what it is
