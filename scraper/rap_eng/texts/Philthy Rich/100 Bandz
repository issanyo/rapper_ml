D-Lo, D-Lo
Look, look

[Hook: D-Lo]
Band after band bitch I get it in
Hunnid bands, times ten
I got bands and these true religious
Need two iPhones, got too many bitches
Band after band bitch I get it in
Hunnid bands, time ten
Hunnid bands, Hunnid bands
Hunnid bands, Hunnid bands

[Verse 1: D-Lo]
Just sipped six ounces got ten left
Bitch I'm talkin' money smell it on my breath
I'm talkin' band after band bitch I get it in
Hunnid bands, times ten
Niggas talkin' bands don't know the meaning of 'em
Rubber bands wrapped around a hunnid hunnid's
All I do is keep it one hunnid
All my choppers hold one hunnid
All these bitches they love me
Niggas pullin' up on me tryin' see how fast my car go
All this syrup she gonna turn me to a diabetic
A hunnid bands will get you knocked off fuck a paramedic
But you know how the game go
Young nigga I been stackin' money like Legos
Cute dick bitch do what I say so
Ride around town I stay strapped like I'm Django

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Moses]
Moses
(?) head, rudeboy, hunnid band maker
Bad bitch breaker, smokin' loud stackin' paper
I'm a broke hoe hater, money motivator
If she ever see me count it I bet she never doubt it
And I'm on like this mike is, wasted like the white kids
Trying to get my dick inside this white bitch, yeah
And all I ever wanted was the cash
Tell a broke bitch to kiss my ass, and bitch I gas
Got a loud pack with a chopper
Bitch I do it big like poppa and you niggas can't stop us
Hoes sit back and just watch us
I'ma do it all with my partners, do it all with my partners
I'ma do it all for them bands
Tell your bitch I don't wanna be your man
Need a hunnid times ten
I just need a million not a bitch
Gettin' rich, sip the syrup, bought the brick nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
They say these these niggas ain't a hunnid
They ain't never seen a hunnid
Little nigga last money, I just ran through a hunnid
Twenty on a piece and a twenty on the chain
40 pulled up and blew twenty on my gang
Nigga if your ballin' then go'n buy your bitch somethin'
100 pair of red bottles but you ain't buy your bitch nothin
Slide down E-1 I bet I see a hundred flags
A hunnid missed calls on my iPhone I don't call back
I done find a leaser a hundred bitches wanna come back
But she gotta have a least a hunnid for her to come back
Hunnid dollar special yeah that bitch do it bad
Tryin' to do ten a day so she can put up a stack
A hundred on these foreign's, I don't want it if it's boring
And I'm talkin' bout your pussy need a hundred for you to fuck
A couple hundred pour it up if I ever catch a case
You better off being careful cause my niggas breakin' safes

[Hook]
