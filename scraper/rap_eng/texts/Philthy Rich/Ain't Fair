[Intro: Team Eastside Peezy]
It ain't even fair
Send 'em through the air
Might get the chair
Send 'em through the air
On these niggas, it ain't even fair
Main bitch and pull her hair, ayy

[Verse 1: Team Eastside Peezy]
Killin' these niggas, it ain't even fair
I got all my jewelry on to make the bitches stare
I might fuck a nigga main bitch and pull her hair
The way I'm ballin' on these niggas, it ain't even fair
I might rob a fuck nigga with no mask on
But that ain't even my MO, I get bags on
Pull up on me, I ain't talkin' on no tapped phone
You just out here in the way, take your ass home
Stand up nigga, you ain't got a backbone
Been in the club five minutes, half a rack gone
Put a bitch on a 'Hound and send her back home
Try to snatch a nigga chain and get your cap blown
Spent a half rack on this McQueen scarf
Shirt was nine hundred bucks from gettin' P's off
We ain't never out of drink, bitch we keep sauce
Just might get a nigga whacked if I get T'd off

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
Ballin' these niggas, it ain't even fair
Might fuck a nigga main bitch and pull her hair
Might drive them bitches in or send 'em through the air
The way I'm killin' these niggas, I might get the chair
Ballin' on niggas, it ain't even fair
Might fuck a nigga main bitch and pull her hair
Might drive them bitches in or send 'em through the air
The way we killin' these niggas, we might get the chair

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
All this money that I'm havin', bitch it ain't fair
All I did was keep it real, bitch you ain't care
Everything bust down, no plains here
Eighteen carat on the Rollie, ain't a stain near
If you a broke nigga then you wasn't meant to ball
Touch down in Miami, we fuckin' up Ball
I was really in the kitchen fuckin' up raw
Tryna package all this dope and missin' all these calls
Pull up on Stunna on Stunna Island
Told him I'ma need the jet, I'm tryna fly private
The Bugatti still got low mileage
Ain't met a bitch yet who still got low mileage
Five hour energy, got a deuce of oil
Full synthetic Castro for the Wraith of oil
Loyal to my niggas, loyal to my soil
I can translate to English if you need that pollo, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
Ballin' these niggas, it ain't even fair
Might fuck a nigga main bitch and pull her hair
Might drive them bitches in or send 'em through the air
The way I'm killin' these niggas, I might get the chair
Ballin' on niggas, it ain't even fair
Might fuck a nigga main bitch and pull her hair
Might drive them bitches in or send 'em through the air
The way we killin' these niggas, we might get the chair
