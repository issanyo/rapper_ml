[Chorus: PHresher]
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work

[Verse 1: PHresher]
You wasn't around, I was down on my luck
Now every day I be countin' it up
Screaming your name and they proud of you, huh
These niggas only be down when you up
They say ain't no Khaled but we be the best
Keep it a buck but you keepin' it less
Might aim for my chest so I keep me a vest
I hope you bird niggas sleep in a nest
Flooded my chain, I feel like New Orleans
Change my whole family life and record it
The way that I ball, my name should be Spalding
I gotta make sure the money keep calling
I'm steady shittin' while y'all niggas falling
Couple of things that I need to sharpen
Cold day in hell and my niggas starvin'
I sic 'em, they biting, no time for no barking
Gotta feed my ony son, gotta feed my lil daughter
She cherish everything that I taught her
Worth more than anything I ever bought her
Any and every track I'ma slaughter
If I come up short then they come up shorter
No time to ball, they don't even bother
Off with your head if my kids ever bothered, yeah
I shedded some tears when I wrote this shit
Be hurting inside, no one notices
Can't let out my feelings, no notices
Skrrt skrrt off the lot, ain't no quoting shit
But when I'm on it we talkin' the win
My pieces hittin' like I got a band
I know these niggas don't want me to win
When did this hatin' shit become a trend?

[Chorus: PHresher]
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
Ever since a nigga made it, couple niggas hatin', but it's all good with me
They say that I've been MIA, in and out of the state, but I bring the whole hood with me
All of my streamers be loaded, all of my niggas be loaded, woo, huh
All of my bitches be goin', they fuck me
They fuck the whole crew and they know it
I stopped taking drugs and started seein' shit differently
Niggas must didn't think I noticed
They smile in my face but talk behind my back
I be cool and act like I didn't notice shit
Act like it don't bother me but it be botherin' me, honestly I don't even know why
You act like you fuck with me, act like it's love with me, sit right up under me, y'all sus
That's a flag on the play, you out of bounds, out of place
I can tell you mad by your face
'Posed to be my mans, why you hate?
See y'all niggas change by the day
So I do my thing out the way
It's only a few real ones left
I don't treat 'em different, love 'em all the say
Teamwork make the dream work, but you gotta be a team first
Didn't seem hurt, you ain't put in work, you just wanna rock the team jersey
Wannabe version, nigga if you ain't first, you just tweet on me like you was worth it
I can't even lie, yeah that shit hurt me, Derez De'Shon

[Chorus: PHresher]
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
I ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me
Just keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me
Don't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me
I die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work
Teamwork, teamwork make the dream work

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
Teamwork make the dream work, half these rappers never seen work
Bad bitch, new Celine purse, she gon' suck dick 'til her knees hurt
They don't want smoke, they don't want pressure
Name a nigga on the West fresher
BK with my nigga PHresher
Fishscale, you can see the texture
If I put money on a nigga head, be the only time a nigga worth somethin'
Seminary niggas gon' murk somethin' and your baby mama gon' twerk somethin'
Twenty-sixes on a Benz truck with a bad bitch from Dikeman
She Dominican but she light skinned
My niggas beat that indictment
Hit Lush just to celebrate, got a thousand ones and a thousand guns
Them Seminary boys get money
Where you from niggas just a thousand bums
My Philly bitch got a fat ass, she only bartend on the weekend
She mad as fuck at me right now 'cause I was in her best friend DM
It's Philthy
