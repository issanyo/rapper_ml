[Verse 1: Stunna Girl]
Bitch, you ain't touchin’ money like you say you do
Better tuck your ice, nigga, 'fore I put the play on you
Bitch, you ain't gettin’ money like you say you do
Better tuck your ice, nigga, 'fore I put the play on you
Yeah, take me on a long vaction
When I drop the addy, pull up in your Wraith
When I drop the addy, pull up in your Wraith
Pull up in your Wraith, nigga, pull up in your Wraith
When I drop the addy, pull up in your Wraith
Hah, pull up in your Wraith, nigga

[Chorus: Stunna Girl & Philthy Rich]
Nigga, pump your brakes, bitck, break your pumps
Bitch, hit that Blade, bitch, make them bucks
Hop in them trucks, slow feet don't eat
Bitch, ain't no sleep, better move your feet
Yeah, I bent it over like I lost somethin'
He wanna feel on this ass, he know it cost somethin'
Yeah, I bent it over like I lost somethin' (Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga)
I told him what I wanted and he bought somethin’ (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, bitch wanna fuck, I need a fee first (Ayy, I need that)
Stop playin’ a dumb role, you need to rehearse (Stupid bitch)
Respect a nigga pimpin' like it’s worth somethin' (Respect somethin')
I can't respect your hoein’ if it ain't worth nothin' (Uh-uh, bitch)
Fly little bitch, but I can upgrade you (Is that right?)
Bitch fagged off and came back a month later (Faggot)
Twenty thou' or better, bitch, or you can keep it (Chump change)
He punched his best friend's man and couldn't keep a secret (It's Philthy, ho)
Bitch break your pumps, don't pump your brakes (Ayy, do that)
Take your pumps off when you in the Wraith (Foreign)
Club Truth in Detroit, eatin' lamb chops (Ayy, eat it up)
Bitch, I'm everything that your man not (It's Philthy)

[Chorus: Stunna Girl]
Nigga, pump your brakes, bitck, break your pumps
Bitch, hit that Blade, bitch, make them bucks
Hop in them trucks, slow feet don't eat
Bitch, ain't no sleep, better move your feet
Yeah, I bent it over like I lost somethin'
He wanna feel on this ass, he know it cost somethin'
Yeah, I bent it over like I lost somethin'
I told him what I wanted and he bought somethin'
