[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit

This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
This one for them niggas that's been hatin' since day one
This one for my jeweler, got my chain with VS1's
This one for my sons, yeah I love them boys to death
This one for my Atlanta bitch who got to Georgia Tech
This ones for my niggas that I got locked up in prison
Pussy nigga mad at me 'cause he's the one that's snitchin'
This one for them four foreigns sittin' in my garage
This one for my niggas in the kitchen cookin' pies
This one for my nigga at the counter tryna slide
This one for that bitch that said she love me but she lied
This one for my niggas that be hustlin' in the trap
This one for my hood because I put 'em on the map

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
This one for my old ho, this one for my new ones
This one for these simple-minded bitches actin' stupid
This one for these niggas who was hatin' on the low
This one for you pocket watchin' niggas goin' broke
This one for these hoes got me on child support
I'm ballin' anyway, I'll never ever go to court
My kids super straight, got everything that they ever want
Paid my lawyer with all hundreds, I ain't goin' to the joint
This one for my mama, told you I'ma make you very proud
This for all my niggas dead and gone, I know you lookin' down
This for all my trap niggas, just ran up and buyin' a pound
This for all my niggas buyin' a brick and flat-footin' it down

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the bitches said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
This one for the niggas said I never would be shit
