[Intro]
It's Philthy, free JBay, look, look

[Chorus]
Free JBay, I been sending money through the JPay (free JBay)
Collect calls, got bad bitches on three-way (hello?)
He just like mine, I'ma make sure your son straight (he is)
We gon' hold it down 'til you touch down on a one day (it's Philth)
Free JBay, I been sending money through the JPay (free JBay)
Collect calls, got bad bitches on three-way (hello?)

[Verse 1]
Fuck Instagrams and websites
What happen in the dark come to the light (it will)
Drop a deuce in my cherry Sprite (syrup)
I'ma chunk a deuce if she don't fuck tonight (bitch)
Ain't nothin' guaranteed but death (uh-uh)
I was outside on the front step (I was)
I been having everything but stress (I have)
He been smokin' cigarettes 'til the butt left (it's Philthy)
Twenty-thousand on the paid lawyer (that's twenty thousand)
In the hood with the SIG sorted (I keep it on me)
Tennis bracelet with the ninety pointers (bust down)
Double-R Wraith with the angel on it (vroom)
Hit Quentin, then High Desert (goddamn)
Them pussy niggas, we apply pressure (pussy)
Got a bad bitch from the Tribeca (pussy)
And a new foreign with the fine leather (foreign)
He took fifteen with the L (with the L)
When I was fifteen I first seen a scale (I swear to God)
Residue up under my fingernails (thirty-six)
Had the best dope and the clientele (it's Philthy nigga)
No money didn't change me (uh-uh)
It just changed the people around me (is that right?)
Four rings on like an Audi (bust down)
Spent two years in the county, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Free JBay, I been sending money through the JPay (free JBay)

[Verse 2]
It's Philthy nigga, look
I been buyin' all this Goyard (designer)
My brother locked on the fort yard (he is)
Took him away from his only son (his only son)
He can't see him grow up, that's the cold part (ayy free JBay)
Your nigga ain't on my level (broke nigga)
Them fifty pointers in the Rollie bezel (bust down)
Outside in the coldest weather (Seminary)
With a zip of dope and an old Beretta (it's Philthy)
Your son like my son (my son)
I was beatin' up the pot son (I was)
No we ain't happy with the outcome (uh-uh)
It's when the income is the outcome (I need that)
On the phone with Lil D (hello?)
He talkin' about he proud of me (good lookin' nigga)
From Seminary, I'm proud to be (I am)
I don't owe a nigga no apology (pussy)
I was raised by Mone and Main (Mone and Main)
He say he from here but I don't know his name (I don't know his name)
No Superman, no Lois Lane (uh-uh)
Just thirty-six and the whole thing (thirty-six)
Rest in peace my nigga Jodie Boy (rest in peace)
I think about you when I catch a ten and four (I do)
Stuffed chicken with the dinner roll (is that right?)
He say he gettin' money but in a rental though? it's Philthy

[Chorus]
