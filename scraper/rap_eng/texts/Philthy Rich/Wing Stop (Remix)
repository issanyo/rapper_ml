[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Respect a man who can turn his own key
Twenty women in the crib, I'm talking hide and seek
The lifestyle that I live, niggas deserve to see
So I let you in my crib just as a courtesy
To put your on niggas, what your goals for
That's why I bought the Wraith and two ghosts for
Making music but the snitches say we dope boy
Woke up to US Marshals kicking the door, boy
Black Dali in my all black Impala
Or red Caprice where I'm known in these streets
Come to your city nigga and I'm never checking in
Cause my hitters who hit it never respected him
We put your home address nigga off of LinkedIn in
Man, who hotter than Yowda, my nigga Meek and them
Fifty financial woes, I never speak of them
Years ago Pimpin’ Curly we know we ethered him
At the Mayweather fight, I got my gun tuck (Boss)
Second row and I'm smiling just like I'm Young Buck
Young king, drug ring, Bun B, Pimp C
Rep mine as I ride on my enemies

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
I need a ten piece of lemon pepper
Don’t hit my phone unless it’s 10 or better
I tell the bitch, look, hold the ranch
All these hundreds busting up my bench
You want this whole chick, meet me at the Wing Stop
You want this half a bird, meet me at the Wing Stop
You need this nine pack, meet me at the Wing Stop
A four and a  baby, meet me at the Wing Stop

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, niggas talk but they don't live it right
Yeah, I'm talking what I'm living, right
I'm getting chubby so I'm living right
Play Shakur, give it to you tonight
A couple dollars for the drop off
Come up short'll get you knocked off
These niggas 'round here wearing knock offs
I told a nigga he better knock it off
A ten piece of the lemon pepper
That's a code, he want ten of 'em better
Shit, I can get you ten whatever
Matter of fact, I can get you ten forever

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, I need a ten piece of lemon pepper
Don't hit my phone unless it's in a battle
I told a bitch, let her hold the wrench
All these hundreds busting up my bench
You want this whole chick, meet me at the Wing Stop
You want this half a bird, meet me at the Wing Stop
You need this nine pack, meet me at the Wing Stop
A four winged baby, meet me at the Wing Stop

[Verse 3: Yowda]
Let's trap at Wing Stop, I'm in the kitchen with the chicken
Guaranteed to numb his face if he finger lick it
I had to raise the price, cause it was slim pickings
Copped a foreign now it's time to do some rim picking
Pulled a Miami out, we use Louisiana here
Go over the work, Louisiana run
Caught a million dollars, you can get a ten piece
Your bitch treat my dick like a ten speed
I bring in so much snow it's like a land slide
City to city, boy, I'm tryna franchise
Twenty-one minutes, I can get your chicken right
He out of state, ordered yesterday
He'll get his shit tonight

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look, I need a ten piece of lemon pepper
Don't hit my phone unless it's in a battle
I told a bitch, let her hold the wrench
All these hundreds busting up my bench
You want this whole chick, meet me at the Wing Stop
You want this half a bird, meet me at the Wing Stop
You need this nine pack, meet me at the Wing Stop
A four winged baby, meet me at the Wing Stop
