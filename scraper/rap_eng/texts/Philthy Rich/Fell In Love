[Intro: Philthy Rich]
Ayy it's Philthy nigga, uh-huh, look
Bust my first hammer then I fell in love
Seen my first brick then I fell in love

[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
Goin' through some things, money hide the pain
Can't get on this train, don't lose your life over a nigga chain
Bust my first chopper, I fell in love with sticks
I'm at the pharm with this shit, I fell in love with scripts
Fell love with that road that changed a nigga's life
Turn around and I continue to get the whole price
My first time tastin' drink I poured the whole pint
I doubled back, did it again, we did that shit twice
Fuck written, we gon' buy 'em, that's just how I'm feelin'
I'm really winnin', I'm just chillin', I just made a killing
You either real or you fake, you can't be in the middle
Catch a nigga while he slidin' by and get his shit riddled

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Bust my first hammer then I fell in love
Bust my first Rollie then I fell in love
Seen my first brick then I fell in love
Hit my first lick then I fell in love
First piece of pussy, almost fell in love
Then the bitch gave me head and I couldn't nut
That lean had me snorin' and I fell in love
Drove my first foreign and I fell in love

[Verse 2: BandGang Masoe]
Seen my first Glock and threw my first shots
We ain't just playin' with these bitches, pussy knock you out your socks
We ain't layin' with these bitches, I might let her give me top
With Philly totin' the Glock, made me feel like I'm on our block, yeah
Hit my first lick with brodie, one off the bench
I might tell the ho I love her, she come with a hundred slicks
Every nigga with me icy, could buy up a couple bricks
I ain't bought my first foreign but I'm comin' for it you bitch
'Bout to ice my niggas' faces we lost, real as it get
All these niggas causing problems, can't buy a pot if he hit
It ain't coming easy to you, lil brodie grind for this shit
Stayed a hundred, came from nothing so we shining and shit, bitch

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Bust my first hammer then I fell in love
Bust my first Rollie then I fell in love
Seen my first brick then I fell in love
Hit my first lick then I fell in love
First piece of pussy, almost fell in love
Then the bitch gave me head and I couldn't nut
That lean had me snorin' and I fell in love
Drove my first foreign and I fell in love

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
I say good drink when I'm in the D, bad bitch, she into me
Niggas hatin' on me that's a penalty, eatin' pasta like I'm in Italy
Lean in my kidney, I lean in my Bentley
Push start, I don't need a key, I jumped off and I bought a key
I remember my starter piece, I remember we broke the lease
We ain't have nowhere to sleep, I ain't been asleep in a week
In the trap we was runnin' hoes, outside with a runny nose
I was wearing my brother's clothes, I done spent a whole month in those
Locked up playin' dominoes, canteen full of Top Ramen ho
Been thinkin' 'bout my styrofoam, them sucker niggas, we don't get along
Seminary, that's my hood, V12 under my hood
Twenty-four still ride good, when I'm on P-Rock I'm good
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Bust my first hammer then I fell in love
Bust my first Rollie then I fell in love
Seen my first brick then I fell in love
Hit my first lick then I fell in love
First piece of pussy, almost fell in love
Then the bitch gave me head and I couldn't nut
That lean had me snorin' and I fell in love
Drove my first foreign and I fell in love
