[Intro: Philthy Rich]
Zaytoven
Yeah it's Philthy, nigga
Cook with that shit dope
Pullin' up on these pussies
Everything white
Everything black
Everything paid for
Lah, look

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
All my foreigns white, nigga
I was cookin' that white, nigga
Feds tryna indict niggas
Give the whole hood life, nigga
Your bitch ain't my type, nigga
You made a ho yo' wife, nigga
Bust down this ice, nigga
Double cup my Sprite, nigga
All my foreigns black, nigga
Same color of my strap, nigga
I was in that trap, nigga
Double up, get back, nigga
Where I'm from, we smack niggas
Cold pimps, drug dealers
Watch me make a million
While they whippin' coke up in the kitchen

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
I was a underdog on the Murder Dubs
Thirty six when I started to rob
In the kitchen with the burner off
See stacks on 'em, that's a murder car
Pullin' up in these white foreigns
Hit those black with the right arms
These chains on, I'd die for
If you hit the trap, we out the side door
Got a side bitch, damn I'm beller
Door to door the bitch with the long fella
F&N with the chrome barrel
If I could meet the plug in '98 Valero
Twenty four, sittin' on the wraith
It gets bad, but now it's in the play
Went from choppin' O's on a paper plate
Now it's twenty thou' sittin' in the safe
These diamond chains, they dangle
Rosé? No, Cîroc mango
Get Jose for the yayo
Hunnid bricks in the Dodge Durango
Now, I ain't signed with the Birdman
But I'm in the kitchen with the birds, man
Cookin' dope out a burnt pan
All day, 'til I got a hurt hand

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
All my foreigns white, nigga
I was cookin' that white, nigga
Feds tryna indict niggas
Give the whole hood life, nigga
Your bitch ain't my type, nigga
You made a ho yo' wife, nigga
Bust down this ice, nigga
Double cup my Sprite, nigga
All my foreigns black, nigga
Same color of my strap, nigga
I was in that trap, nigga
Double up, get back, nigga
Where I'm from, we smack niggas
Cold pimps, drug dealers
Watch me make a million
While they whippin' coke up in the kitchen

[Verse 2: Cookie Money]
Streets talkin', cookin' filthy, out here folk gettin' naked
They gettin' money, they the richest out in Oakland with it
Smokin' dope in the Ghost, yo' bitch suckin' dick
Youngest nigga in my city, Patek on my wrist
All black foreigns, forty zoned all my shit
Glock 27, thirty shots and all these clips
I got it all on my own, you can't tell me shit
Old niggas hated on me, put they tax on zip
I stack my money on 'em niggas 'til I copped a brick
Same niggas fell off, now I serve them shit
You ain't stand out, the way you fell in love with a bitch
In the streets all day, I fell in love with gettin' rich

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Look
All my foreigns white, nigga
I was cookin' that white, nigga
Feds tryna indict niggas
Give the whole hood life, nigga
Your bitch ain't my type, nigga
You made a ho yo' wife, nigga
Bust down this ice, nigga
Double cup my Sprite, nigga
All my foreigns black, nigga
Same color of my strap, nigga
I was in that trap, nigga
Double up, get back nigga
Where I'm from, we smack niggas
Cold pimps, drug dealers
Watch me make a million
While they whippin' coke up in the kitchen
