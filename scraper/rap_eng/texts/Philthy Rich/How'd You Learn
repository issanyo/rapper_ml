[Intro: Prezi]
Let me hear that shit

[Chorus: Omar Kadir]
Do I look like I got all night long?
I'm fly as I ever been and I get that you need me
But I got a long flight back home
Show me what my time worth, show me how far this dime go
Now how’d you learn that on your own?
She want me to believe her, baby, I can't believe that
So how'd you learn that on your own?
She said, "I swear, you taught me everything I know"

[Verse 1: Prezi]
I got money waitin’ on me, I can't stay long
I ain't gotta flex a check 'cause she understand that I got it
Why they wanna knock me off of my throne?
They havin' spiteful conversations and Prezi name be the topic
I'm the king of my city, no debating, I correspond with the politics
Don't I make it obvious? I'm in love with my cockiness
Knew since a youngin, to make it, I needed confidence
Constructive criticism, I’m cool with that like they compliments
Thick skin, they talkin’ 'bout me but I love this life
Catch me state to state and I’m touchin' down on all kind of flights
All bark, no bite, I swear them niggas all kind of hype
Believe in me, baby, I'm comin' back when the time is right
And I made this shit happen on my own
And I’m barely gettin' sleep like, "Where the time go?"
I taught you everything that I know
But now I catch you doin' things that I don't

[Chorus: Omar Kadir]
Do I look like I got all night long?
I'm fly as I ever been and I get that you need me
But I got a long flight back home
Show me what my time worth, show me how far this dime go
Now how'd you learn that on your own?
She want me to believe her, baby, I can't believe that
So how'd you learn that on your own?
She said, "I swear, you taught me everything I know"

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Ayy it's Philthy, nigga, look
You can't move off emotions 'cause they temporary (Uh-uh)
New foreign off the lot, the paper plates temporary (Foreign)
Spending money before you can have a bitch spend the night (I was)
Real estate and property, can show you how to spend it right (It's Philthy, ho)
If you see I cut him off, then that nigga was flawed (Fufu)
We don't cooperate or conjugate with the law (We don't do that)
41 Prezi on my main bitch (Day to day)
18 karat gold, no stainless (Bust down)
Me and that nigga Fatts on the FaceTime (Hello?)
Movin' all these packs 'cross the state line
Fuck what you heard through the grape vine (Huh?)
If a nigga say I'm broke, bitch, then they lyin' (It's Philthy)
I fucked my enemy bitch and her pussy stink (I swear to God)
Lost a couple zips in this kitchen sink (Thirty-six)
Big-face Patek, take out a link (Is that right?)
Winter time baby, put on some minks, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Omar Kadir]
Do I look like I got all night long?
I'm fly as I ever been and I get that you need me
But I got a long flight back home
Show me what my time worth, show me how far this dime go
Now how'd you learn that on your own?
She want me to believe her, baby, I can't believe that
So how'd you learn that on your own?
She said, "I swear, you taught me everything I know"
