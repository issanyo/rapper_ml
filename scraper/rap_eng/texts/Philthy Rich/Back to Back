[Intro]
This is Jay P Bangz music

[Chorus: Mozzy]
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Never not take a trip, as long as I live
I ain't got a half a dollar to throw to the bitch
Happy bladadah, I bless lil' bro with the stick
Kicked the cup 'cause my mama an' them want me to quit
Soft 80K play, I could show you the wrist
Many mansions and things, ma, let me show you the crib
It's multis in the stogie, what's doper than this?
Watch his mama overdose, lil' homie and them sick
To this gang-related sign, I'm loyal forever
Maserati redskins, imported the leather
Fourth Ave and Santa Bruz my corner forever
Gang war advocate and supporter forever
Hit Prezi, them sticks ready, I'm on the way
Real Sacramento nigga, in love with the Bay
Ayy, it's 100K or better, you fuck with the play
You know it's Funk or Die, nigga headhuntin' for game

[Chorus: Mozzy & Prezi]
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him (It's Prezi)
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted

[Verse 2: Prezi]
Feelin' better than I used to be, and now they noticin'
They get a dose of me, they can fit it all in they ovaries
I'm so proud, I'm successful just like I'm 'posed to be
It's dangerous where I'm from
So take caution when you approachin' me
Long flights, but thank God I be first class
'Bout a bag, but if she broke then I gotta pass
She ask me do I love her, that shit made me laugh
The bitch ain't even notice me when I was doin' bad
Flyer than I ever been
Let me get you out your element
These hatin' niggas be irrelevant
The club I get the hammer in
They can't tell me shit
You niggas couldn't buy the game if I was sellin' it
Ain't had to let my niggas feed me, but I was gettin' greedy
Broke the bitch for everything, and now she say she need me
I'm that nigga, I swear to God I don't need no reason
These niggas salty, it's obvious they don't need no seasoning

[Chorus: Mozzy & Philthy Rich]
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
(It's Philthy, nigga)
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
Uh, look
Fifty thousand on dogs, yeah that my side hustle
Pups ten thou' a piece, I watch this money double
I got a bitch in Minnesota say she really love me
But when I was doin' bad, she ain't throw me nothin'
Rest in peace Nia Wilson, that fucked the city up
Hi-Tech in my system, might fuck my kidney up
These niggas want my position, they gotta take it from me
I don't give a fuck about rappin' if it ain't makin' money
She keep my trap on the dresser, my pistol in her purse
I'm always thinkin' 'bout Fetty, I miss him and it hurt
I reinvented myself and threw on all this Gucci
Them bitches back on my dick like they ain't never knew me
Back to back takin' losses, got me sick and nauseous
Niggas close to me plottin', so I'm stayin' cautious
Back to back takin' losses, got me sick and nauseous
Niggas close to me plottin', so I'm stayin' cautious
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Mozzy]
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted
Back to back losses, we built for it, we bosses
You couldn't imagine what all of these diamonds costin'
They gave him life for a hot one, that's what it cost him
Run it up on these niggas 'til we exhausted
