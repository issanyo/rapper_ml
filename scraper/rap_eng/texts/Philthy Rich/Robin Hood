[Intro: Sada Baby]
June, you're a genius
Ayy, find they hood, ayy
Shoot them niggas, ayy
Like Rodney Hood, ayy
Huh, huh, I doubt they fire back
I doubt they fire back
I doubt they fire back

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
Who them niggas? Ayy
Find they hood, ayy
Shoot them niggas, ayy
Rodney Hood, ayy
I doubt they fire back
Ah, Robin Williams, ayy
Ah, rob a rich nigga
Ah, Robin Hood, ayy
Ah, who them niggas? Ayy
Ah, find they hood, ayy
Ah, shoot them niggas, ayy
Ah, Rodney Hood, ayy
I doubt they fire back
Ah, Robin Williams, ayy
Ah, rob a rich nigga
Ah, Robin Hood, ayy, ugh

[Verse 1: Sada Baby]
Pussy ass nigga, don't bother me
I hold my Draco awkwardly
Mom said I can't have company
Nigga better not ever not come for me
Knock a nigga out of his Robin jeans
I'm up but still commit robberies
Hollow hit him in the stomach, colonoscopy
Break a bitch heart with honesty
Pour my drink, that's Honest Tea
Lil' bitch with me got gonorrhea
Like I can't pay her no mind
Fuck around and get to actin' crazy like
Like I can't pay her no mind
Fuck around, she tryna have a baby
I throw a bitch off the backboard
Slam her back in, Scuba Tracy McGrady like huh
Hmm hmm, let me tell you somethin'
My young dawg here tryna sell you somethin', huh
Pull a four-five on a nigga then I just lay him
Guess that's where the hell he from, hey
No cap, I'm filthy rich
Big homie gave me fifty bricks, ayy
No cap, I'ma hit your bitch
Block her number after she suck my dick like huh
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang in the living room
Auntie give my shit to Philthy for me, she gon' send it to him
A nigga say he ain't got my re-up, then we gon' get into it
I might have the whole Seminary put them pistols to him
18, left him 'bout thirty, hmm
Twelve shots went to a murder, huh
Seventeen bars on Wednesday, hmm
Two-three fives by Thursday, hmm
Five hundred dollars for the Bulova, hmm
Twenty-eight thousand for the Rollie, huh
Twenty-five thousand for the crib game
Better not steal 'bout five dollar Rollies, huh

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, I say, hundred thou' out a bad bitch
She a centerfold, nothin' average (Uh-uh)
Still the number one draft pick
Three to win the game off the glass, bitch (It's Philthy, ho)
Amiri jeans cost a little thousand (Designer)
Amiri jacket cost two bands (Designer)
Skinny jeans with stupid bands
Tell Skuba Steve do the Skuba dance
In the D like I'm from there (Ayy, what up, though?)
Name a nigga ever did that (Ain't nan' one)
Play with me and get kidnapped (Ayy, do that)
We slid up and slid back (Slide)
Hundred thousand with gold or somethin' (Chump change)
Another hundred thousand or a hundred (Swear to God)
Bought my Asian bitch a pair of buffs
She ain't even wore them bitches once (It's Philthy)
In the red zone with some reds on (Red bottoms)
Seminary nigga, kill zone (Seminary)
Smokin' on gelato, kill zone (It's five nothin')
Ten thousand, boy, the pills gone (Is that right?)
On the East Side, nigga, 7 Mile (East Side)
Told the plug I need the big amount (I need that)
Bitch say she wanna settle down (Bitch)
Talkin' 'bout she want a wedding now (It's Philthy)
On the turnaround, nigga, me and Smoke (Turnaround)
Ten years fora  key of coke (Thirty-six)
They flick they lights, I'ma run they ass
This a track car, all they seein' smoke (Swear to God)
Chanel bags for my bottom bitch
Every year the ho stayed down (Solid)
Chopper ringin' off in the hood
Better grab the hoods off the playground (You better)
Steak, lobster, and shrimp, bitch (What else?)
Fried rice with the combination (Ayy, eat it up)
Fuck his baby mama with the F&N
Make him give up the combination (You better, nigga)
Fifty pointers in the diamond chain (Bust down)
New rose gold set from Gary (Bust down)
Fast money like Big Berry (Fast money)
Broke nigga, he secondary, it's Philthy
