[Verse 1 - Philthy Rich]
Where I'm from they close caskets before they
Nowadays it's 4k just to book a show
The last four years, twice a week, I been booked fo' sure
No manager, just me and my niggas when we hit the road
Don't burn the bridge, that shit might have to cross later
See when the traffic die down, you can cross later
I been sliding on ice like I'm from [?]
Let AJ and Regine is all love this
Lil Larry that's my brother, blood couldn't make us closer
He bang the third, I bang the sem, we both bang the toaster
I line you up a few dollars, we gon' get it done

[Hook - Philthy Rich]
But I don't have to give 'em shit, they do it for the love
I've been goin' through some things, so I'm smokin' heavy
Double cup on my serve, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
Lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy
We been goin' through some things, some smokin' heavy
Double cup on my syrup, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
A lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy

[Verse 2 - Lil Blood]
Rep the red, lil' nigga, syrup, still got the fourth
Shirt tucked in my jeans, it's Dark Town with dirty red in it
And everybody seen a shooter, still don't know who did it
And everybody salute the shooter, leave no fucking witness
I'm a king from war, what can I do the dishes
Premonitions of plenty riches and pretty bitches
And prep, wanna make the law, I just wanna trap the more
The fact that I can snot an axe, roll cap and high bow
I promise on my momma, I will roll in a half an hour
Show you with that choppa, show you with that coppa
Illuminate, all appositions get vicious propositions

[Hook - Philthy Rich]
But I don't have to give 'em shit, they do it for the love
I've been goin' through some things, so I'm smokin' heavy
Double cup on my serve, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
Lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy
We been goin' through some things, some smokin' heavy
Double cup on my syrup, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
A lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy

[Verse 3 - Lil AJ]
We creep trhough late night smash your lifeline
Really with the street shit, rocking with this Glock 9
I'm on some other shit, fucking with my crip niggas
They really hitting hundred thousand dollar licks niggas
It's Last Money nigga, I got my own camp
You niggas boosie shooting niggas over coochie
No BFE, my niggas on that P shit
Don't get it fucked up 30 still on that seat shit
I'm tryna switch it up on that fucking rapping shit
Cause you other niggas still telling on that ratting shit
We slide through, yellow tape it's a done deal
Mickey Mouse bouncing out after that nigga chill

[Hook - Philthy Rich]
But I don't have to give 'em shit, they do it for the love
I've been goin' through some things, so I'm smokin' heavy
Double cup on my serve, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
Lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy
We been goin' through some things, some smokin' heavy
Double cup on my syrup, I been sippin' heavy
And this 40 I been carrying, man, it's so heavy
A lot of shit on my mind, got it feelin' heavy
