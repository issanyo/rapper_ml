[Intro: Prezi]
Fuckin' with them niggas, I knew better
Time to change the scoreboard, these suckers tryna move clever
Homies ain't slidin', we can do better

[Chorus: Prezi]
I put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better

[Verse 1: Prezi]
Fuckin' 'round with them niggas when I ain't have to
Mama told me be cool, them niggas bad news
Put my trust in a bitch and she fagged too
Commissary week and she ain't even bring the bag through
I'm back now, most of these niggas got ho tendencies
She say she love me but you know just how these bitches be
Murder charges 'cause you know just how these snitches be
Shit'll drive you crazy if you ain't prepared mentally
Touchdown, I wasn't going for no field goal
Too much on the line 'cause me and my daughter real close
I knew better, who think they fucking with me?
Hammer on me, brothers with me, shit ain't nothing to me
Collecting money for Lee until my nigga get back
You said you love him, shit got tough, where you niggas was at?
You knew better you'd do better, them niggas faking
Caught up in your old ways, you niggas ancient

[Chorus: Prezi]
I put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I ain't talked to my sister in damn near a year
She just had a new baby but I ain't took the time to see her
I done did so much for her but she don't appreciate shit
She'd rather steal from her brother, lil petty ass bitch
Niggas locked up, only call when they need money
I don't complain about the shit, I just find the shit funny
My bitch on some square shit, keep asking for a baby
But if I tell a ho no, is she still gon' pay me?
Man this life crazy, I been stressed out lately
Owe two hundred thou in taxes, the IRS waiting on the payment
My baby mama keep threatening me with child support
Told her what you waitin' on? bitch I'll see your ass in court
I remember '06, you couldn't keep your legs closed
Came home, found out you cheated, grabbed my hammer and my clothes
It's all good, seven more years he'll be eighteen
Free JBay, my brother took fifteen, it's Philthy nigga

[Chorus: Prezi]
I put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better

[Verse 3: OMB Peezy]
Okay I hit the lick when I knew better
Fuckin' with some new niggas
They done took this shit to a new level
Fuck nigga turned stool pigeon
Pussy nigga tryna move clever, but ain't no hidin'
I'm welding shit when I use the metal
Ain't tellin' my mama 'bout no beef, how the fuck she findin' out?
Keep callin' my phone, tellin' me to come home, fuck that, I'm wildin' out
Fuck it, I'm pissin' in the street, ain't tryna find a pot
Bitch these the wrong chains for you to reach for 'cause you bound to die
See blood when I close my eyes
Found out he tryna plot, fed him when he ain't have a dime
Made your bed now, it's time to lie, can't rest when you testin' my mind
Blessed, I'm the best of my kind, missed it, better press the rewind
Seen so much shit sometimes I thought it'd be best if he blind
Spending my time checkin' the blinds, goin' to rest with that iron
Flexin' get you checked with that nine, don't stress, just prepare for the ride
Spending my time checkin' the blinds, goin' to rest with that iron
Flexin' get you checked with that nine, don't stress, just prepare for the ride

[Chorus: Prezi]
I put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
Yeah, every time I turn around he got a blessing for me
It's been progressive and them L's just a lesson for me
You know the syrup necessary, pay whatever for it
My nigga gone, they say that heaven place is better for him
The yicky on me, I gotta keep it, you know I do
Them niggas breathin' on the fella, fuck I'm 'posed to do?
I'm out here eatin' mama, what's the point of goin' to school?
When I'm helpin' you with the rent and payin' for all this food?
Saw fifty for the jewels, that was somethin' light
Emerged from the trenches and doin' better, I'm lovin' life
It's somethin' 'bout the Benz engine when it come to life
The leather in the loft is from Italy, Katy Perry white nigga
You say these bitches is trifling and you ain't ever lied
Crackers keep kickin' in mama door, they been on my line
Death before dishonor, loyalty is hard to find
Shout-out them niggas in my corner when it's in me shine

[Chorus: Prezi]
I put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Put my trust in a bitch when I knew better
Hit that lick when I knew better
Fucked with them niggas when I knew better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better
Family telling me to do better, I'ma do better

[Outro: Prezi]
Do better
Move better
Better, better, better
