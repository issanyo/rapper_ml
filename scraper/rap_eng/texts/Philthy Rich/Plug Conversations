[Intro: Philthy Rich]
It's Philthy nigga, uh-huh, look

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, I said now plug talk, nigga plug talk (plug talk)
Designer on me, nigga blood walk (designer)
Atlanta niggas want to mud talk (ATL)
Detroit niggas want to crud talk (ayy what up though?)
In the trap gettin' drugs off (Seminary)
Two for tens and them dubs off (two for ten)
All that fake shit done rubbed off (huh?)
To a real nigga you real soft (pussy)
Actavis with the seals off (syrup)
If it ain't on 'em then the deal off (uh-uh)
Diamonds on me make me chill off (bust down)
Nigga touch one and I peeled off (he will)
Where I'm from I'm the big dog (Seminary)
Got good girl, got real dog (real dog)
All this ice like a mil on
Them broke niggas, I don't deal with y'all (it's Philthy)
We ain't never in the field with y'all (uh-uh)
Nah we ain't never slid with y'all (never)
We ain't never hit a lick with y'all (never)
So we ain't tryna get rich with y'all (never)
We ain't never did a deal with y'all (uh-uh)
We ain't never did a drill with y'all (never)
Never countin' up a mil with y'all (never)
So we ain't tryna be seen with y'all (never), it's Philthy

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation

[Verse 2: Allstar JR]
Ran up some racks on niggas (I did)
I ain't look back for niggas (fuck 'em)
Got your bitch acting different (fuck yeah)
Let me rub on that ass and pinch it
Trap nigga with a hit single (yeah, yeah)
Dope spot my income (trappin')
Tried to like these little hoes
It's hard to 'cause I been fucked (knock them hoes off)
I ain't want to drink, this nigga Philthy got me pourin' that
Twinkle wrist jettin', yeah that crack done got me glowin'
I was sleepin' in the house with one bedroom
Now I'm makin' bales move
I stash and sell blues
First the bezel, boss it up and get the band blue
We run the eastern market, look at all this damn food (work)
Hit the Yay with percs and yay, that shit like Steph and Klay
When this conversation over, make another play, nigga

[Chorus: Philthy Rich]
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation
Two bosses sittin' at the round table, it's a plug conversation
On FaceTime while we count the paper, it's a plug conversation
Connect ain't answer but he got me waitin', it's a plug conversation
Bitch irritating, you see me concentrating, this a plug conversation
