I8 cost a buck fifty (a dollar fifty)
When you add the Masse that’s 750 (and add it up)
You know I still got the Panamera (you know I do)
And I still got the Aston Martin (you know I do)
Still got the chameleon Masse (you know I do)
Boy that’s more than a million dollars (it's Philthy)
I know a million niggas wanna rob me (a million tho)
But them niggas bet not ever try me (uh uh)
You know them niggas really killin' bout me (Seminary)
Fuck around and have a million bodies (I swear to God)
You know the foreign's parked in the lobby (foreign)
You got a play? You can run it by me (is that right?)
You lookin' for me? Nigga come and find me (slide)
Best believe we don't do no hidin' (it's Philthy ho)
Rolls-Royce on 24's (24's), on Figaro, down 20 toes (I am)
Right now I'm only two deep (just two deep) but nigga out trap like 20 hoes
Pulled up in the new Benz (huh) that cost me like 210 (huh)
Tied up my loose ends (I had to), no time for no new friends (uh uh)

Look, sippin' all this Actavis (syrup)
Used to hide the dope under mattresses (36)
Stack it up no magic trick (stack it up)
Probably see me out wit' the baddest bitch (it's Philthy ho)
No rental, no more middle (uh uh)
Niggas goin' broke wit' a cold feelin' (broke nigga)
Outer space in the new Wraith (huh, huh), I can count stars in the solar ceilin' (it's Philthy)
At the dentist fixin' four fillin's (I am)
In the kitchen I’m a cold chemist (skurt, skurt)
Ya niggas never tag me in your mentions (never)
So how the fuck I know who you dissin'? (pussy)
Them niggas mad that they in a rental (they is)
Kinda sad and they sentimental (it's kind of sad)
Play wit' me and I'll send a demo (huh, huh)
You niggas pussy, you ain't get the memo? (It's Philthy)
They say all I rap about is stuntin' (is that right?)
But bitch a nigga really come from nothin' (Seminary)
Now a nigga finally got somethin' (it's Philthy ho)
You niggas mad 'cause you ain't got nothin' (I know they mad)
In the i8, nigga why hate? (hater)
The bitch wanna be my date (bitch)
I have the bitch home before 8 (I will)
I left dick in the bitch face
