Yo, man
Niggas know how I got my name, mayne
(Mac B-l-l-l-ast!)
I put shit on Mac Blast and I blast niggas, you know
That's what it is, mayne, so you know
(Yeah)
Even if you my potna, I can’t have fake love for myself if you be fake
(Hell nah)
Now I might not expose you
All that type a shit
(Nah, mayne)
But when it come to a nigga
I ain't gon' be fake and lyin’ to my motherfuckin' self
(Fuck nah)
Same thing with these niggas that be gettin' high
Playin' around all up in the closet, nigga
(In the closet)
I'm not no child molester, nigga
(Sucka-ass shit)
I'm not 'bout to be sneaky about what I'm doin’, nigga
(Fuck all that shit)
Feel what I’m sayin'
Now if it’s some crime, criminal shit, of course
But I'm sayin', that's the game
(Fa sho)
Bro, I’m in the 'jects, nigga
I'm gettin' high, bruh
(Yeah)
Young nigga, teenager
Nigga I'm doin' weed, know what I'm sayin'
Fuck I look like, I ain't some-
That's how them dope fiends get
(Stupid ass nigga)
They know they ain't supposed to be smokin' crack
Know what I'm sayin'?
They got fake love for their fuckin' self
They know they ain't 'posed to be doin' somethin' so they're bein' sneaky
(Scared of theyself)
You become worse
When you run from yourself, which is impossible
You got fake love for yourself, you become a knock
(Stupid niggas)
Know what I'm sayin'?
Uh, another example of fake love
Is when a nigga got a lack of love for your nigga vision and ambition
You feel I'm sayin'?
(Come on, mayne, gotta have love for that)
And the police be hatin' on Philthy fa sho
(Fa sho)
Hatin' on his vision and ambition, feel what I'm sayin'?
For all our shit, you feel?
(They don't want us rich)
From the beginnin'
With the arrestses and in and out of county jail and the probation
(Into the back)
You feel what I'm sayin'?
But now with him
The gift and the curse
Was the stayaways from Sem, you feel what I'm sayin'?
(That Oakland shit)
Now his ambition done changed, his vision didn't change
(Nah)
But the path to get there had to change
(Yeah)
Good thing the path that he chose was music, right?
Now, 'cause
The reason I say that 'cause
Seminary got a long rap history, you know
(Long rap history, nigga)
Uh, $hort
Fuck with huh, that's what I'm talkin' bout
(You can see us over there)
That's a longshot
Pooh-Man fuck with Sem, know what I'm sayin'?
But that shit, you know, that's a longshot, you feel what I'm sayin'?
Stone, you know
I know fa sho he done got like a quarter million dollars
Can't do this rap shit when you in this shit
Know what I'm sayin'?
But bruh locked up, you feel what I'm sayin'?
(Locked up)
The Gov, you know that nigga really got locked up
(Super locked)
Feel what I'm sayin'?
Fuckin' with, uh, Pac and all this shit
(Man)
The handlebar breakers out in the end of it
So that nigga, you feel what I'm sayin'
But he caught up, too
(Yeah, bruh's caught up)
So now, that leaves one other person with hella lines
(Who, man? Who?)
His dog, Dane Fame, feel what I'm sayin'?
(Exactly)
Man, outta Fame own mouth, feel what I'm sayin'?
(Come on, man)
He said the worst rap decision he ever made was not fuckin' with Philthy the way he should
(Shouldn't have been no decision, though)
You feel what I'm sayin'?
For his other situation, I'ma leave that alone
Feel what I'm sayin'?
To me, I'ma keep it one hundred
It's less about the decision and more about fake love
(Yeah, that's fake love right there)
I've never had the rap lines
(Yeah)
But I had the money and had the love
So I cashed out the studio
(Fa sho)
Put the studio at Major D house
(Major D, cool daddy)
Every nigga I got love for that can rap can get on a CD
Now I'm not gonna sit here and name I put on the town rappin', but
Can you imagine me not writin' for Weezy?
Not lettin' him on a CD?
Bein' a rapper or not, nigga, I love this man
Nigga, I love this nigga, this bruh, nigga
(Mayne I love this nigga, on pimp, niggas know what's up)
So imagine me bein' from Sem, with super rap plugs
And not havin' love for my young nigga vision and ambition
No time, folks, that's not gonna happen
(No time, no time, no time)
How you gon' wanna change your life
And the nigga with the plugs don't help you
Now, if Drake fetti had the plug, psh, it's a sure shot
You feel what I'm sayin', 'cause it's real love
Drake one of the main niggas that believe in bruh's vision
You feel what I'm sayin'?
That's why bruh rep lil' cous' to death
You feel what I'm sayin'?
(To death, nigga)
Now, stayin' on topic
(On topic, nigga)
Now if my bitch kick me out
Now that's just for example to go on with this bit
(Hahahaha)
So if my bitch kick me out, and Philthy let me use the van
You feel what I'm sayin'?
To go get my clothes and all the shit, feel what I'm sayin'?
Or, if I'm at Jack London
And I see the opps, you feel what I'm sayin'?
(There go the opps)
And I call Philthy like, "Bruh, man, what's up, man, bring that hammer thang"
(Ring, ring)
"Hammer time, let's get it started, nigga"
Bruh slide up with the niggas, know what I'm sayin'?
"Boom, where they at?"
At this point, nigga we fuckin' with you
(Fa sho)
You one of my young niggas, know what I'm sayin'?
(He solid, bruh)
So when he do his rap thang, he might even wanna impress me
When he write his raps and all the shit, feel what I'm sayin'?
Based on genuine love
(Genuine love)
So I can't make no wor- no worse decision than that, know what I'm sayin'?
(Yeah, ain't no decision to make, mayne)
It's always gon' be, "What can I do for you, lil' bruh?"
You feel what I'm sayin'?
So he didn't make no decision, know what I'm sayin'?
When he brought that motherfuckin' hammer, feel what I'm sayin'?
Or let a nigga use the van, feel what I'm sayin'?
It's like I say, stayin' away from that lil' new street-ass nigga, know what I'm sayin'?
Game recognize game, and me bein' a Mob nigga, that's fake love, feel what I'm sayin'?
(That's fake love)
If I'm fuckin' with you nigga, I'm fuckin' with you
Know what I'm sayin'?
If I'm willin' to give you a pistol, or go knock a nigga down for you, nigga
(Mac B-b-b-last)
I got to be boomin' to do some square-ass shit like plug you into the fuckin' music scene, nigga
(Exactly, exactly)
That's a easy decision, it shouldn't even be no decision
That's where you niggas fuck up at bro, know what I'm sayin'?
That shit is weird to me, nigga
(Real love, though)
I'ma give you a thang, nigga
Or slide for you and all this type of shit
And I can't put you on, nigga
Put you on your feet, man
Bruh out there givin' niggas APs and all type of shit
(Throwies and all type of shit)
Gotta swoop that, bro, and that's what it is, bro
(Love you, man)
Know what I'm sayin'?
(A real nigga, though)
So if you got some fake love in you, bro
Nigga, don't sit here a-a-and try and defend yourself
(Nah, nah, that's fake, too)
Just recognize the fakeness in you
Liberate yourself
You ain't gotta tell nobody or nothin'
Nigga, look in the mirror, be like
"I been doin' some fake shit, I gotta get back, I gotta do right"
So you ain't gotta keep tryna get high
(Yeah)
To forget this, to forget this
(Exactly)
Smoke hella weed, forget that, forget that
Nigga, nah, nigga, stop bein' fake
(They ain't gotta see it)
Ask the good creator for the answers, or Jesus, or whatever you believe, mayne
(You can't run from yourself)
Ask yourself, nigga, for forgiveness
Apologize
Nigga do what the fuck you gotta do, man, know what I'm sayin'?
(Stand up)
Stop bein' fake, nigga
Salute this shit, you know what it is, man
(Gotta respect that, bro)
Yeah, yeah, fast lane, fuckin' with it, man
(That's some real game)
From The Sem to The Jets, nigga
(Fa sho)
Stop bein' fake, nigga
(Sem- Sem- Sem City in the house)
