[Intro: Ralo]
Yeah, whoo!
Fam, goon
Oh Twysted
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell 'em I'll never look back
Got the game in the book bag
Got the streets in a choke hold
We gon' get them bricks by the boat load
Stay down, ten toes, them bricks in, they get sold
We ain't never goin' back broke
Nigga, fuck a friend where that pack go
You ain't gotta tell 'em [?]
We ain't goin' back and forth about a ho
All that hatin' shit, it's out of control
Never talk to a ho 'bout the bro
Never switch up, never bitch up
Get the picture, I don't miss her
I don't love her, I don't want her
I don't need her, I never did

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Pockets bigger than an elephant
Got the F&N with a felony
Remember they ain't wanna let him in
Now I'm better than [?]
Percocet with the ten, yeah
Grab my bitch and go in, yeah
Ask her, can I fuck her friend, yeah
That lil pussy gettin' big, yeah
Drop the top then I burnt out
Fuckin' freak hoes got me turn't out
In the parking lot fuck a parking spot
My shit cost a lot, yeah
My shit cost more than his, yeah
A young nigga with them M's, wooh
Got more money than my peers
And they been workin' all the years

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell 'em I'll never look back
Got the game in the book bag
Got the streets in a choke hold
We gon' get them bricks by the boat load
Stay down, ten toes, them bricks in, they get sold
We ain't never goin' back broke
Nigga, fuck a friend where that pack go
You ain't gotta tell 'em [?]
We ain't goin' back and forth about a ho
All that hatin' shit, it's out of control
Never talk to a ho 'bout the bro
Never switch up, never bitch up
Get the picture, I don't miss her
I don't love her, I don't want her
I don't need her, I never did

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Die [?] got me stressed
Last nigga try me, he deceased
Two hundred thousand on the piece
So when I die, you can bury it with me
Rap niggas, don't compare 'em to me
In the trap I was wearin' a key
Baby chopper, hundred rounds to the knees
Greyhound, a hundred pounds of the [?]
Nigga, I was really stuck in the streets
Front line when it come to the beef
You the nigga be promotin' the piece
Hundred [?] I can let of the leash
Ask Gucci, had him on my street
Hit Gucci, twenty thousand on sneak's
[?], I'm the king of the east
You catchin' niggas still and bring 'em to me
Rolls Royce, no Wrangler Jeep
Balmains, no regular jeans
Actavis, no regular lean
He text you [?] stay on this D
Private jet, lookin' out at the wings
Broke as fuck, I couldn't afford me them wings
Now I'm ballin' up here in my team
Stay down, do you know what that mean?
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell 'em I'll never look back
Got the game in the book bag
Got the streets in a choke hold
We gon' get them bricks by the boat load
Stay down, ten toes, them bricks in, they get sold
We ain't never goin' back broke
Nigga, fuck a friend where that pack go
You ain't gotta tell 'em [?]
We ain't goin' back and forth about a ho
All that hatin' shit, it's out of control
Never talk to a ho 'bout the bro
Never switch up, never bitch up
Get the picture, I don't miss her
I don't love her, I don't want her
I don't need her, I never did

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All my niggas want the same thing
[?] treat the rap like the dope game
Tell her, Ralo, we like [?] and [?]
We ridin' in, got the frame
Still in the hood, we ain't gon' change
Op shit, pray to her Lord when I aim
Pop shit, my nigga pull up, bang, bang
[?] this ain't no joke
Iced out my Cartier frame
Geeked, fucked that lil freak like my main
You better put some respect on my name
Lil bitch when you on it, you ain't even change
You want the money, you can have the fame
Poppin' champagne with the bust down brain
Shoot that shit up like a [?] game
Young nigga fresh like Novocain
I'm rich and fly like a [?] on a plane
Fifty thousand [?] I do is plan
Flippin and kicking it, it's a coincidence
That my plug and my bitch is from Spain
She wanna fuck a real nigga, you lame
Pop a perc' I can't even feel the pain
Got the mud, that lil dirty, the rain
Flex on a new 1017 chain

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell 'em I'll never look back
Got the game in the book bag
Got the streets in a choke hold
We gon' get them bricks by the boat load
Stay down, ten toes, them bricks in, they get sold
We ain't never goin' back broke
Nigga, fuck a friend where that pack go
You ain't gotta tell 'em [?]
We ain't goin' back and forth about a ho
All that hatin' shit, it's out of control
Never talk to a ho 'bout the bro
Never switch up, never bitch up
Get the picture, I don't miss her
I don't love her, I don't want her
I don't need her, I never did
