[Intro: Team Eastside Peezy]
Niggas say we fucked up but I can't tell
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread
I’m a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell
No matter how much time they offer, I just can’t tell

[Verse 1: Team Eastside Peezy]
Funny money ass niggas, call 'em Sinbad (Niggas broke)
Don't be playin' with this shit you get a shit bag (Fuckboy)
Four of Wocky got me leanin' like a kickstand (I'm leanin')
All these rides at the crib, feel like Six Flags (Yeah)
Everybody keep on askin' when that album droppin’ (It’s comin')
In a minute, shit, right now I got a package droppin’ (I'm busy, nigga)
I was broke and niggas act like they forgot about it (Oh yeah)
Just might have Golden Sun make me a platinum chopper (Ugh)
Nothin' like your favorite rapper, he a fuck nigga (He a fuck nigga)
Nigga short me one-forty, get a buck-fifty (Uh-huh)
I don't care how much you poppin’, you can't fuck with me (You can't)
Need a line on that *woof* than get in touch with me (Hit me up)
Niggas say we fucked up but I can't tell (I can't tell)
No matter how much time they offer, I just can't tell (Nah)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (For real)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread, bitch

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
Niggas say we fucked up but I can't tell (I can't tell)
No matter how much time they offer, I just can't tell (Fuck nah)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (For real)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Nigga)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread, nigga)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (Yeah)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, Bentley truck, no lease (Is that right?)
Had Golden Sun make the Bentley truck beast (Bust down)
Mike Amiri jeans with no crease (Designer)
Can't bring that nigga 'round me, he a known leak (Philthy)
Tell that bitch break bread or play dead (Broke bitch)
He ain't sippin' Hi-Tech, he pourin' fake read (Karo)
I used to serve his mama, she a basehead (18)
Fifty thousand to my lawyer, now the case dead (It's Philthy)
The enemies of my enemies is my best friend (Pussy)
I get the job done for a light ten (Chump change)
The Wraith white on white with a light tint (Foreign)
The rims on the S63 cost ten, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
Niggas say we fucked up but I can't tell (I can't tell)
No matter how much time they offer, I just can't tell (Fuck nah)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (For real)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Nigga)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread, nigga)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (Yeah)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Let's go)

[Verse 3: Icewear Vezzo]
Yeah, hundred thousand, all jewels, put that pressure on him (Bitch)
I ain't steppin' in the club 'less that weapon on me (Nah)
Got a Glock-19 with the extra on us (Bah)
Buyin' pints, best believe, bitch, I'm steppin' on it (Skrrt)
F&N and the semis so the shirt tucked (Semis)
Got on all designer shit, 'bout to murk somethin' (Yeah)
She ain't tryna give me neck give that skirt up (Give that skirt up)
Started poppin' Percs but gave the syrup up (What?)
All this water on my chest got me seasick (Ugh)
Bought Patek, could've went and got three kicks (Facts)
Spent sixty on mines and Ki shit (KiKi)
Watch the murder rate rise off C6

[Chorus: Team Eastside Peezy]
Niggas say we fucked up but I can't tell (I can't tell)
No matter how much time they offer, I just can't tell (Fuck nah)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (For real)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Nigga)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Break bread, nigga)
I'm a hustler, it ain't shit a nigga can't sell (Yeah)
Tell them niggas play dead or either break bread (Let's go)
