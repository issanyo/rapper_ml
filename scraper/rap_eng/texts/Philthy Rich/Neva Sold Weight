[Hook: J. Stalin]
There's rules to this game how a nigga play (play)
Cause niggas out here dying every day
I just keep my strap on me and my money straight
But you wouldn't understand if you ain't sold weight
[x2]

[Verse 1: Lil Blood]
Nigga you ain't never trapped out no trap house
Slept on the floor with the roaches and the rats out
You ain't never rolled behind that black gate
When the block was slow we brought it back by selling 2 for 8's
What you know about that pineapple coke
In the drought, we the only niggas outside selling dope
Instagram, broke his wrist daily in the dope vine
Hitting it with the skert, making sure we keep the fattest rinds
Locked the hood down, we has junkies watching every corner
They gone scream highwater every time they see the rollers
Nigga tell me what you know about the trap house
We really had them goons out front, posted with the mac's out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Blow]
Check a real nigga out though
There's rules to this game you better abide by em
Broke niggas ain't up in it they just sidelinen
Up in the Bay you rep the Mob or your LiveWire
Me and Ray gon' get rich or we gon' die tryin'
I ain't never left the state and I ain't fly with pounds
G-lock wit a ladder when I ride around
Shit for tech up in Seattle 75 a ounce
Tell the lean man slide through and ima buy him out
Bitch know she made a band after four dates
When I sold weight was making bands on a slow day
Niggas dying every day just like the song say
Never faking, fuck you if you taking it the wrong way, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil AJ]
You ain't never sold weight where your ice at
Pink slips and shit lil nigga been coppin whip
I been selling weight but know I'm a lash kid
One button car park itself now I'm the nig
Fell out wit a nigga (?) knew a lie
I ain't trippin bury his ass you try to hit the spot
We on four five strap that's that mecka block
Any nigga run up I swear get them nickel shots
I fuck wit Keesa and Lil Wee they gon' go for me
Just knocked a black bitch in Sac she gon' hoe for me
Rest in peace Jacka, we keepin' 2 K's
Claiming other niggas just rappin'
Swear they ain't with the blazing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Philthy Rich]
I was funking before rap you better learn your facts
He told on you, you told on him, you still labeled a rat
I rep my hood in ever song I put it on the map
Rest in peace my nigga Jacka he tatted on my back
My nigga Dame came home he did ten years
More touched down in January he did ten years
(?) in a halfway house my nigga halfway out
Now JBay locked up because a nigga ran his mouth
Nigga you ain't sold dope on one corner
How everybody from your hood snitching but you condone it
Nigga I was in the kitchen 36 whippin'
You wasn't in the house before the streetlights you gotta whip it, pussy

[Hook]
