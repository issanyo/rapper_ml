[Intro: FMB DZ]
Got Wood on this motherfucker
Hmm, yeah, ayy, huh
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
I'm down with my niggas if they right or wrong
Wake up, say my prayers with my jewelry on
'Bout to be rich around this bitch, it ain't gon' take me long
What you laughin' at? Your mans look bad, you need to put him on

[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
That nigga need a loan
That's your dog? Throw his ass a bone
Smokin' birthday cake with stones, this shit super strong
You ain't on my level, my first Rolex was fully blown
It's really hard to believe you home when you don't own a home
See these niggas wanna act like me, I think I got a clone
Shoot you in your dome, get you gone, send a nigga home
Expensive shit, this my life, I'm really livin' it
These lyin' ass rappers get in the booth and start killin' shit
I'm down

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
I'm down with my niggas if they right or wrong
Wake up, say my prayers with my jewelry on
'Bout to be rich around this bitch, it ain't gon' take me long
What you laughin' at? Your mans look bad, you need to put him on
I'm down with my niggas if they right or wrong
Wake up, say my prayers with my jewelry on
'Bout to be rich around this bitch, it ain't gon' take me long
What you laughin' at? Your mans look bad, you need to put him on

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Ride for my niggas bitch, right or wrong
That syrup had me high, I couldn't write a song
Wake up first class, what flight I'm on?
He on the buddy pass, that shit take too long
Fell asleep in the trap with all my jewelry on
I'm good in the hood, you need to take it home
Costume jewelry, get your faking on
Used to sip an eight a day to the face alone
Thirty on me nigga and my gun alone
Plus a hundred niggas with me, I don't come alone
Your man looking bad, need to put him on
Forgiatos on the Bentley, 'bout to put him on, it's Philthy

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
I'm down with my niggas if they right or wrong
Wake up, say my prayers with my jewelry on
'Bout to be rich around this bitch, it ain't gon' take me long
What you laughin' at? Your mans look bad, you need to put him on
I'm down with my niggas if they right or wrong
Wake up, say my prayers with my jewelry on
'Bout to be rich around this bitch, it ain't gon' take me long
What you laughin' at? Your mans look bad, you need to put him on
