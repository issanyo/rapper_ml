[Intro]
It's Philthy nigga
Uh, niggas went broke and they changed up, hah
Look, look, look

[Verse 1]
Niggas mad at me 'cause I been doin' me
Before I met you nigga I was doin' me
I been havin' me, I been in the streets
It might be new to you but it ain't new to me
Bitch I make money, music, and enemies
Pussy niggas, all they did was envy me
They like when you broke, they hate you when you rich
That ain't my fault my nigga, I ain't make you snitch
The best offense is defense
He passin' out names at the precinct
Fuck what you had in the past tense
'Cause I accepted you nigga as is
He was on paperwork way before I met him
Niggas tried to kill him and I wouldn't let 'em
Niggas tried to tell me but I wouldn't hear 'em
Man I couldn't believe it 'til I finally read 'em, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Look, niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
Niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up

[Verse 2]
Fuck who had first, bitch who had it the longest?
Bitch I got the torch and I had it the longest
He say he took it back 'cause he really didn't want it
Nah he took it back 'cause he really didn't own it
I cut them niggas off, now they really not poppin'
Bitch that CD whack, ain't nobody gon' cop it
Bitch I'm my own boss, ain't nobody gon' stop it
Seminary nigga 'til I finally get bodied
He used to fuck with me, been fuckin' with suckers
Them the same niggas you said was the suckers
No I never changed, you said that you loved me
But you changed on me for a little bit of money
You can ask DN, I never switched up
Even back then, as broke I was
Bitch I stayed down 'til I finally came up
The hottest nigga from my town and I never changed up, it's Philthy

[Chorus]
Look, niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
Niggas went broke so they changed up
In his feelings over hoes so he changed up
I been ridin' foreigns, never changed up
That nigga turned informant so he changed up
