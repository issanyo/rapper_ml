[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Understand that I was made for it
When I was down I ain't wait for it
Therefore I deserve this moment
Just take a look what we came from
I was down and I was lonely
Looking for a way and you didn't show me
You ain't giving, we gon' take something, take something
All or nothing, we gon' take something, take something
How we coming, we gon' take something, take something
No questions, we gon' take something, take something motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Ain't drove the i8 in months so the battery dead
No remorse for that sucker, I'm glad that he dead
JPays to JBay on the weekly basis
Get released on parole and get an ankle bracelet
My sister and my baby mama went against the grain
My bitch wasn't sold either, I found myself to blame
A sucker knocked me down in field, take care of your brother
I'll never do for one what I'm doin' for the other
Deal and Dame, them my brothers, fuck a last name
The same niggas that was around me 'fore the cash came
I can't lie, I been kickin' since I stopped sippin'
Yeah, we can win a trial if niggas stop snitchin', it's Philthy

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Understand that I was made for it
When I was down I ain't wait for it
Therefore I deserve this moment
Just take a look what we came from
I was down and I was lonely
Looking for a way and you didn't show me
You ain't giving, we gon' take something, take something
All or nothing, we gon' take something, take something
How we coming, we gon' take something, take something
No questions, we gon' take something, take something motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 2: YID]
My same niggas, they gon' take somethin', ayy
Fuck them Glocks, yeah them K's comin', ayy
Fuck a lake, how we gon' fade somethin'
If they put you in that room you better not say nothin', ayy
You gon' die if you try to rob me
All of this pain built up inside me, that K kick like karate
At my empire, talkin' plays with Gozzi
I know you see the shooters that's behind me
So nigga try me, it's gon' be bodies
So nigga try me, it's gon' be bodies, yeah yeah
All in, yeah that's how we comin'
Stackin' that money on money, all my niggas be thumbin'
Ain't talkin' Nick Cannon, yeah, but you know we be drummin'
And you wouldn't understand nigga, 'cause we came from nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Understand that I was made for it
When I was down I ain't wait for it
Therefore I deserve this moment
Just take a look what we came from
I was down and I was lonely
Looking for a way and you didn't show me
You ain't giving, we gon' take something, take something
All or nothing, we gon' take something, take something
How we coming, we gon' take something, take something
No questions, we gon' take something, take something motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 3: Slimmy B]
Catch a sucker leaking, we gon' take somethin'
Niggas better tuck they chain 'cause we gon' take somethin'
Get up off your ass broke bitch, go and make somethin'
Ridin' through the V with that draco tryna paint somethin'
I don't play no games, I don't say no names
Ain't no white flaggin', ain't no tuckin' chains
I spent forty on my Benz 'cause I'm fuckin' paid
And if your bitch don't like me then she fuckin' gay
This lifestyle I live, I was made for it
Ain't have shit, on my dick, I had to take for it
SOB the gang and I'll spray for it
And if a nigga hit my bitch he have to pay for it, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Yee]
Understand that I was made for it
When I was down I ain't wait for it
Therefore I deserve this moment
Just take a look what we came from
I was down and I was lonely
Looking for a way and you didn't show me
You ain't giving, we gon' take something, take something
All or nothing, we gon' take something, take something
How we coming, we gon' take something, take something
No questions, we gon' take something, take something motherfucker, yeah
