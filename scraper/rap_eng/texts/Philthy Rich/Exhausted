[Intro: TK Kravitz]
TK Kravitz, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Once I started bein' myself I start bossin'
When I lost my partner, bitch I lost it
Went and flooded out my neck like I'm a faucet
I'm tired of fuckin' these hoes, I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
Yeah bitch, I'm exhausted

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Shawty gettin' the same results, she got through somethin' different
No this ain't the same foreign, we in somethin' different
Every nigga from my hood, I put a chain on him
If you ain't from my blocks you can't hang on 'em
Fuck the baddest bitches up in every city
Had to kick the cup, it's fuckin' up my kidney
Countin' all this money got me exhausted
All this designer hanging in my closet
Raised by the streets, I never had a dad
Almost lost my mind when I lost Dre and Chad
Diamonds drippin' on me like a runny faucet
I remember runnin' with the pistol, tryna toss it

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Once I started bein' myself I start bossin'
When I lost my partner, bitch I lost it
Went and flooded out my neck like I'm a faucet
I'm tired of fuckin' these hoes, I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
Yeah bitch, I'm exhausted

[Verse 2: TK Kravitz]
I can't be fuckin' these hoes like I want to
'Cause the first thing they gon' do, go to The Shade Room
They so messy
Why the fuck they wanna be messy?
That's probably why the man upstairs always blessed me
I'm 'bout my music, why the fuck they wanna test me?
And to be real, ain't no motherfuckin' recipe
If you ain't one hundred you can't stand nowhere next to me
I never claimed somethin' that I knew I wasn't
Bitch I started poppin' then I gained a hundred cousins
But they not my kin, lord knows I sin
If I fall off I gotta take that to the chin

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Once I started bein' myself I start bossin'
When I lost my partner, bitch I lost it
Went and flooded out my neck like I'm a faucet
I'm tired of fuckin' these hoes, I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted
Yeah bitch, I'm exhausted
