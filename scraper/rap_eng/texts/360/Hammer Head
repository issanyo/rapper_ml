[Verse 1:]
I'll challenge your team to a brawl, motherfucker, I won't mean it at all
So, if this shit hits the fan, I ain't cleaning the walls, no
I'm with a grumpy whore, looking for some drugs to score
We need to pull it together, tug of war
When I was born I wasn't fucking around
Doctor pulled me out the womb, I punched the cunt in the mouth
(Oi, you touchin' my mum?) Check out my bone structure
Look, Styalz man, I'm so fucking good, even my own mother would

[Verse 2:]
Yo
Yo I'm a motherfucking thug homie, hell yeah, I like to rob a lot
I ain't no b-boy but you'll see me poppin' locks
I'm a break into your bottle shop, smash all your dodgy Scotch
And start lining up some Vodka shots
Everything is looking up right now
Maybe that's because I'm hanging upside down
If I get famous I'm a brown eye the Paparazzi
After I tat my arse cheeks just to camouflage me
(Whose arse is that?!)

If you wanna, you can come and get us

[Verse 3]
Yo, uh yeah, I'm a be the first Aussie up on MTV cribs
Showing you my room full of M16 clips
(What, cunt?), yes me Three Six...
My next tat is gonna be an mp3 link
I got a drug problem and that problem is
I have to have double the amount to get fucked off 'em
Itâ€™s three sixty, or Russian, three shixtay
Check the website for my free mixtape

[Verse 4:]
The colour yellow is the shit, that's why I think that Elmo is a prick
I gotta let you know I got an elbow on my dick
So if you're interested, then come and watch me flex it
And maybe you can sex it, and you will leave impressed, bitch
We drinking Mai-tai's, then we say goodnight, bye
Head home and have sex while we listen to The White Stripes
Nah, I'm a nice guy, yeah, I like the lime light
But I'm confused as fuck cos it ain't tasting like a lime, why?
