[Verse 1:]
Yo, He tries to stay positive, living in a dead town
He can't keep his head up, he has to keep his head down
He only sees ahead now, the loneliness has left
And he's focused and he's over being left out
He don't need anyone now, he's giving everything now
Look in his eyes and see it's evident now
When he, told himself he would never be left in the ground
For those who told he would never be anything now
He's known what he wants want he grows up
He'll do anything it takes, 'cause it means so much
And it's his ego telling him he sees no love
But now he sees it's irrelevant, he needs no one
But see, as he's chasing up the outline
He found a plane he created to take him from the downtime
And as he wait for it to land, when he makes it up to cloud nine
All he's gonna say is it's about time

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

[Verse 2:]
And from the start though, they always tried to single him out
It was hard though, it almost started bringing him down
And now he laughs at attemps it’s always peaking him out
But now they can’t he ain't listening now (he ain't listening now)
They use to hit him, it would shit him so he’d fight back
And then he stopped once he figured out thy liked that
He knows exactly what it’s like to be the underdog
Words had led him thinking an surprised him at the fucking top
And now they got him, he’s backed in a corner, he’s trapped
But if he starts to relax he’s a goner
In fact, he doesn’t wanna be that kid at all
And they talk, but now he doesn’t hear that any longer
He’s fighting to make a million
Hiding away and feeling
He’s trying to make a killing but he’s dying to make a living
And now he’s knowing it’s a state of mind
Hoping in his day and time maybe he’s finding that place within him

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

[Verse 3:]
And he sees the big picture, what’s the point in being narrow minded?
The ladders high, but he’s knowing that he has to climb it
All the shit he’s sacrificed, knowing what he has inside
He’s ready and he doesn't need a map to find it
It’s the muscle in his chest that he’s pumping all the blood until he’s dead
Knowing nothing will be left
And he can’t let it go, it’s hard to let it be
And you can call it pride, but he can’t accept defeat
And this for those who ain't got no voice
It ain't whether he can do it yo, he’s got no choice
Now he’s got his armor on, and they cannot stop him
Shoot what they want to, watch the bullets bounce of him
He finds it funny now that people had doubted him
Have a look and you’ll see that they’re around again
Because they know now (they know now)
They see him just standing in the corner with a smile as it goes down

[Hook:]
Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)
