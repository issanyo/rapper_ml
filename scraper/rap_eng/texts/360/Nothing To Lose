[Chorus]
This is my world (uh)
Music's my girl (yeah, '60)
Now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose (Uh)
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby (yeah)
Nothing to lose
Baby (uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When I started this album the pressure was on
Couldn't have nothing weak, it better be strong
And I know that I got some incredible songs
And I could never outdo "The Festival Song", wrong
See I know that it's all upstairs
But why did I have to go and crawl up there?
People saw me as a hype man for PEZ
Thought I'd quit rap to be a hype man instead
And they ask "Why is PEZ always getting shine?" (Getting shine)
I'm like, "It's all good, yo, it's PEZ's time"
He deserved it, apart from the beats that we murdered
The time all for me, it was worth it (Worth it)
It feels good to have a major label
They warned us, "Don't ever let the major change you"
And now you're thinking we could probably change the game, dude
And honestly I'm thinking the same as they do

[Chorus]
This is my world
Music's my girl
And now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
It took a while, but I found my feet
Found a producer with the sound I need
And now I'm me with something to prove
It's all 3' with nothing to lose (yeah, uh)
So I could grow and in time we both change
And do my own thing, and find my own way
And people thought it could be a curse
But now I know we're gonna get the push it deserves
I don't wanna live up in my head anymore
And I won't be out walking the fence anymore
Now I ain't out tryna impress anymore
I don't wanna be compared to PEZ anymore (anymore)
But I know that there's things we can teach one another
We ain't out tryna compete with each other
Now you seeing I got something to prove
It's all '60 with nothing to lose, bye

[Chorus]
This is my world
Music's my girl
And now I can chase it
So time isn't wasted
I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby
And they might give hate
And get in your way
You shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause I got something to prove
Baby
Nothing to lose
Baby

[Outro]
Yeah, cheers for coming out
Falling & Flying coming soon
Please Be Seated
