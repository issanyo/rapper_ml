[Verse 1: Bliss]
Direct from the Secret Garden, next to my hovering castle
I break it down fresh like the crunch of an apple
Shit, so just plug in my channel
It's that nutty motherfucker with a bundle of cashews
In his head, I just sled, as the jungle unravels
With my satchel, my lasso, I jumped on my camel
Set forth with my pallet and my colouring pastels
Jonathan Swift-ly writing his Gulliver's Travels
At the Bliss brewery, guzzle a bubbling glass full
Went under my chateau, where I hung up my shadow
From the mantle, free from the government shackles
I can handle anything the governor tackles
They have grappled deep with these troublesome vandals
You can catch me in my hoodie when I come to the battle
In my crooked canoe, pick the puddle to paddle
Still a wonderful chap, who tipped the slumbering cattle

[Chorus: Bliss & Eso]
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
And I can't see you if you coming at me sideways
Bitch

[Scratches: DJ Izm]
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Welcome to something you've never seen before."

[Verse 2: Eso]
It's the rainy days vs the endless summer
The place she made, God bless my mother
It's the laws they make, the laws I break
The highs, the lows, the windy roads
The knowledge in rhyme, versus the bullets in your pistols
The dollars they dive for, the pusher with a Pit Bull
The too cool for school, but never under pressure
The rebel with a cause, whose ready for whatever
So catch me in my hoodie, flipping off the pigs
Don't come around here, there's no shitting where I live
My whole platoon reps one love daily
Mad like Stewie yelling, "Fuck you, pay me" (Got my money?)
On the double 'cause I'm trouble if you don't
Motherfucker there's no muzzle on my nose
I'ma bite back, you like that (Hell yeah, kick it Macka)
I don't need a bike rack, I ride that shitty tractor

[Chorus: Bliss & Eso]
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
And I can't see you if you coming at me sideways
Bitch

[Interlude: 360]
B n E
And 3 n P Easy
Yeah

[Verse 3: 360 & PEZ]
What up bitches? It's B n E and Forthwrite (Yup)
We 'bout to take you on a trip, I'm your tour guide ([?] mate)
And if you missed out on seeing us perform live
Never mind 'cause you'll probly see us on a porn site
(Bitch) Yeah, so sit back and get clappin'
For P Easy, 6, Bliss and Big Macka
I think I'm kinda like a younger Mick Jagger
If he was better looking and a fucking sick rapper
Ah, Jesus, I'm on my shit now
I reckon any and everybody should sit down
I need a drink now, someone get me Cristal
Bliss pulled a spliff out (6, take a hit now)
Yeah, I hope this shit's loud coming out your speakers
And while you sit down, fucking put your feet up
Try to keep up if you want but see, I
Gotta be honest, not a lot of rappers will beat us

[Chorus: Bliss & Eso]
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
And I can't see you if you coming at me sideways
Bitch
