[Intro]
360
La la la, la la la, la la la
What you're seeing, what you're seeing
What you're seeing is what you get now
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 1]
Hey yo, I try to find a common ground
And I sprint from the start while everyone else is joggin' out
And yo, I got the right plan with a nice fam
All I need is a mic stand in my right hand
I'll do it myself, no need for a hype man
I'm never stoppin', spread my wings in this life span
And I think, as I stare at the sky
"60's not a hip-hop stereotype"
And I dress well, not a derelict guy
For my views, yo, I'm ready to fight
'Cause I always hear the same dudes every year, rapping next to us
The same crew from back then with added extras
And yo, I wanna be part of a scene
But not a part of this scene that needs to part at the seams
You start to believe that I harness the dream
60 ain't my real name but, regardless, it's me

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 2]
Uh, sometimes, it might hurt and
Your eyes try to decide but life's worth it
You might try to find the right person
To help on your way, then you find they're a type burden
Every day, you effect the air and breath you take
And definitive days when your friends are fake
(Nah, I try) I think of what helps
And then uh, sometimes, you gotta think of yourself
But maybe is that selfish? Or maybe not
Maybe we can decipher what made the plot
People forever tryin' to take your spot
If you don't let them, then you're safer
What I wanna do is bring the musical raps
So you know you'll enjoy when you're choosin' a track
In this life, yo, I try to be the odd one out
'Cause you know all the rest you forgot about, let's be honest now

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

[Verse 3]
Uh, I won't apologise, I dress to impress
'Cause deep down, I'm an approachable, respectable head
You should never forget that I plan to be sincere
'Cause I wanna make the music that my family can hear (ye-yeah)
While turnin' the page, I'm learnin' that hate
Is workin' a stage and cursin' 'til you're certain to break
And I'll sing my favourite song to people who don't know
I'm gettin' hated on for smiling in photos
And, whether rockin' thongs or wearing kicks
I'd rather look porno than dress a bit like a derelict
Because I don't want chicks thinking I'm hardcore
I'd rather have 'em see my face in their heart's core
You want more? You want me to keep going?
While rocking the beats, knowing that honest MCs know him
It's not a disease, no, I'm just on top of my feet
I'm getting dissed but coppin' it sweet, hopin' for more

[Chorus]
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now
