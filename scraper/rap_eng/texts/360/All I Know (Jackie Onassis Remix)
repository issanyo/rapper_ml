[Intro: Kai]
The Son, 360, Jackie Onassis, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
I know, I know that I can be a juvenile
And you know, you know that you can be one to and I'm
Never growing up but it's going down
Never in my mind, all I know is now
Yo, I'm in it for the

[Ad-Libs: Kai]
Alright, I'm warmed up now

[Verse 1: Kai]
I said I'm higher than Mariah [?], bitch I'm on fire
Got the wind beneath my wings, man, I'm feeling like a king
Even thought my career ain't really all that far
She still come around to do me like a star
Like I ain't in trouble with these payments on my car
Like we still don't smuggle brown liquor into these bars
And it's just one of these nights we get wasted and make bad decisions
But who the fuck am I to go ahead and break tradition
Young, white and foolish, got one life, got two drinks
Got three chicks in the bathroom, we all fried like fast food
Got that new style but I'm old school, I just might go postie
That J.O., that One Day, we cut this [?]

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
I know, I know that I can be a juvenile
And you know, you know that you can be one to and I'm
Never growing up but it's going down
Never in my mind, all I know is now

[Chorus: [?] (360)]
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
All I know

[Verse 2: 360]
I am Ironman, Spiderman, with my giant hands
Eating buildings with my motherfucking tiger fangs
Eating children with my motherfucking iron gang
We drinking till we get retarded 'cause I am Sam
And I ain't buying into bullshit, I'm buying land
And everything I spit is flames, I'm a fire ant
I smoke weed and I admit I'm a fiend
I'm pro-green and I ain't talking bout that British MC

[Bridge: Kai]
Yeah, oh yeah, you say that you know
Oh yeah, you say that you know oh-oh
I said, you say that you know
Ayy, but did you even

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
I know, I know that I can be a juvenile
And you know, you know that you can be one to and I'm
Never growing up but it's going down
Never in my mind, all I know is now

[Chorus: [?] (360)]
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
