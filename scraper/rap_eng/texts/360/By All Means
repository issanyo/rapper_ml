[Intro: 360]
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, can you keep a secret, dude?
We'll keep this shit, between me and you
I've only ever told one person, my girlfriend
So i thought i'd go and let the world in
Look, brother, I love ya, but we're a health risk
Using false wings to escape where no-one else lives
We can't help this
But I'm making myself sick
At how you and I are always making ourselves sick
It's like the drugs are the only thing that'll help this
Really it's that shit in our past we haven't dealt with
I'm scared if it was something I dealt with
I'd be in a cell or have my arm where the belt is
Cause I'd find where that motherfuckers house is
Ask where he got the cards in a hand that he dealt us
Hey yo, I'm sorry if that's selfish
I just ain't afraid to say the shit that no-one else is

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

[Verse 2: 360]
Listen, yo, this is the mindset i called in
While chasing after your dream
When you needed more sleep you gotta stay awake
If you want to make it a sure thing
When life gives you the short string
Confusion is the core thing
Spend time just wondering what it all means
If somebody could guide me, by all means
I had to put the bottle down
And the pills, i don't pop em' now
Always escaping from what got me down
Blocking out a memory i'm wishin' i had forgot about
They wanting my singles to be playful
Light hearted fun shit that young kids relate too
No-one wants to know about the planet i escaped to
As therapy i used to get rid of something painful

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

[Verse 3: 360]
Don't take this song as me complaining but
I know that I'm saying crazy stuff
My close friends are always telling me i say too much
But those that have been through it tell me I'm brave as fuck
I'm sorry if I'm rambling, it helps me out of the bottomless pit that I crash landed in
I've never quite understood why the self-destructive me
Is always sabotaging something good
I was out of control, not all there
Destroying my body, with not a care
Now i understand everything that got me there
In a dark tunnel trying to find a light that wasn't there

[Chorus (Extended): Sam Bruno]
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly
Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly
