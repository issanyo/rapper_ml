[Chorus: JOY.]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

[Verse 1: 360]
Breathe me in, keep me inside
I'll be your friend, I'll teach you to lie
I'll bring you to life and I'll teach you to cry
You got a demon inside, hard to swallow when I'ma eat you alive
Yo, it's time to stop
I created all of these feelings that you keep fighting off
That commitment that you keep hiding from it is kinda gone
Why deny it for?
Meant to be with no strings attached, now we about to tie the knot
"I'm forever yours," no, you're forever mine
Without me happiness is something that you'll never find
'Cause I define you, listen to me and I'll guide you
You're defensive of everything I do, 'cause I've got you believing that I'm you

[Chorus: JOY. & 360]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

[Verse 2: 360]
Don't ignore me, I know you hear me, I ain't quiet
That wall you think is gonna keep me out, I walk straight by it
You're so fed up, try to run but I won't let you
You don't get it, like to think that you know better but you're no better
Will you leave? No, never, see I don't let up
One day I'm gonna come around and put you so low that you won't get up
(You won't) See, they say you're ill
There's something wrong with your head and that you gotta take some pills all because how I make you feel
But I'll make you feel, feel this
What would you rather: feel shit or not feel shit?
The meds will silence that devil in your ear
Until we're toe-to-toe though I will never disappear

[Chorus: JOY.]
You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall
