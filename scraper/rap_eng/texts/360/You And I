[Verse 1: 360]
When I was young I bought two wings
Then I got myself airborne
Felt the rush of this new thing
The only thing that I cared for
Would've never of guessed it
So strong I don't get affected
Doesn't matter if you never get it
Levels ahead, but stay level headed
Spent years in the sky
Lucky that I'm here and alive
Cause' that come down when you touch down
You fear for your life
Hadda really decide
Get on course and then steer to the light
In the sky for so long
It'll make it a little unclear in your mind

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
You and I
You and I

[Verse 2: 360]
Found a way that I'll open doors
Now I know that I'll grow for sure
See it'll open my mind;
Take a second, let it open yours
Had you here with me for so damn long
But now I am a new me
And now i know that's what I needed
I don't want to ramble on
But I let go of everything
That I never had a handle on
Check the cloud that I landed on
What the hell are you waiting for?
Tell me something you're praying for
Say the things that you're grateful for
Feel it coming and wait for more

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
You and I
You and I

[Post-Chorus/Ad-Libs: Styalz Fuego]

[Verse 3: 360]
Is it real or what?
Eyes closed, I feel the buzz
I'm knowin' where freedom's from
Mind open and clear as fuck
I was feeling stuck
Now I don't need no drug
Eyes closed so it doesn't matter
Life's shown me what really does
Never felt love like that
Now I'm sending the love right back
I hit rock bottom
Shake it off and just come right back
I ain't chasing the rush I had
Yo, I'm cool with the rush I have
All it took was a little bit of time
And a little bit of pain and just like that

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
