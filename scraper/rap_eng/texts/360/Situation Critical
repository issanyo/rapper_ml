[Verse 1: Infallible]
I'm sick of MCs that freeze and have a rhyming disease
You're like [?] spitting only [?]
So listen to me, I know what you're destined to be
If you're messing with me, I'll leave your corpse dead in the sea
Seeing critics want addition but they never wish for it
Speaking [shit] behind my back and, even then, they whisper it
We're talking shit without proof, you lose another tooth
The honest truth, in the booth, I hit harder than Costure Zoo
These geeks on the internet scheme
[?] infinite, tell them to get fucked then hunt their modem internet
The joke's on you, wailing like your opinion was relevant
My damn meaning is adamant, you're just cynical and arrogant
I'm fuckin' annoyed with toys talking shit
Behind backs, so you void like promises delivered by Steve [?]
I've got the time for Cyclops [?]
[?] the moment this rhyme stops, I'll have you with my [?]

[Chorus]
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical

[Interlude: Hunter]
That [?] was good man

[Verse 2: Hunter]
Cunts sick of it, bustin' shit, about to stick
On some critics, I'm gonna catch a flick with your missus
Whisper sweet [?] and disses in the ear
While I fucked you up, drinkin' all of your beer
I heard you're queer, not that there's anything wrong with that
But you hang around Peran and charge two bucks for [?]
You dirty rat, you're just a pussy cat on [?]
With Trials' styles, truly unique
Infallible (what?) I was just saying that I'm infallible
I don't bail at any game that I play
It's a game to me 'cause I came to Mel' to see the big lights
Get down and dirty like pig fights
Reignite to [?] any cunt who wants to battle
Me or [?] from the townist in Fremantle
Wood on your saddle, go fuck yours
'Cause I'm Hunter and I stay this coarse
Situation critical

[Chorus]
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical

[Verse 3: 360]
I smack cats while leavin' their tracks blind
They act phat when they just spittin' some wack lines
I jam-pack some anthrax makin' a van slide
If you act kind, I'll leave you with a flat line
I make lyrics to break spirits and take minutes
Out of their lives, sayin' how much I hate critics
Talkin' in the newspapers, tryin' to steer [?]
Their ballsacks about the size of my earlobes
Kiss my arse, suck my dick!
Stick your dick in a toilet because you're fucking shit
Look at these lame cockheads, these bloody name droppers
And they're just lame honest, I'm breakin' their frame on it
And if you step to me, you step to your idol
My lyrics state the [?] like celebrity titles
Showin' you cats, I've got the master, see
Name yourself one-eighty, you're only half of me

[Chorus]
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical
This the situation critical, the media subliminal
They pack the shit before it gets physical

[Verse 4: Versa]
To get ahead of this scene, you're riding dicks like a saddle
These critics accuse me of using pre-writtens in battles
But they can't handle when I dispose the flows that are pitiful
With lyrics full of words that rhyme of an artist ain't shitted on
Knock 'em down like skittles if they refuse to back down
Dissing established artists when you haven't got a track down
A lot of people these days are writing the same dummies
Think you're an MC because you've seen 8 Mile?
All right, because I'm about expressing myself
If you're expecting the well, then here's my confession of doubt
Neglecting the crowd, wack even if you doping shit
These media critics only give us props when it's appropriate
Otherwise, it's lame to be teaching kids about violence
Aerosol artists using Krylon to [?] graffiti tyrants
After you're finished distinguishing, the crew has been diminished
I suggest you keep your distance 'cause I'm finished with these critics
