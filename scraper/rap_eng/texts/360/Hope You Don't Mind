[Intro: 360]
I'ma get on my sort of emo shit on this one
Gonna vent a little
I hope you don't mind
Yeah, listen

[Chorus: 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
And can I let it all out?
See I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (yo)
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, I wish I had a time machine
To change the way that my mind perceives everything my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happening behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray, press play
Lookin' inside, the best way to express pain
Fucking up is becoming something I'm used to
But sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listening sorry for being emo
But fuck what the doctor says, this is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walking into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down
Almost became addicted to the painkillers
'Cause without that feeling, yo, the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly dying to feeling so enlightened
To nearly crying and feeling only frightened
Releasing this is hard, yo, it fuckin' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to terms wit' it
And this is Matt here, I'm giving you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me

[Refrain: 360]
And I know you're probably thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 2: 360]
And with the partyin', I think I needa settle down
To be real, I'm getting a little messy now
A few drinks and I'm stressing out
In another state, looking for my own mum to come and get me out
I got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the fuck alone
I'm only being real, the depression comes and goes
Ignore it, 'cause tonight there is yet another show
Looking in the mirror like, "What the fuck am I staring at?"
Not recognisin' the brutal mess that is staring back
So I'm giving you the deepest shit you'll ever hear
So if you got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hoping that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path, the end for 360 is gettin' near

[Refrain: 360]
I know you're thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 3: 360]
I see my mates like my brothers, yo
I hardly see 'em anymore, the last time was a month ago
They either working or getting in relationships
I should do that too, but, yo, I hate the shit
Don't get me wrong, yo, I love women
With what I see though, it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities'll swallow me whole
And, when they arise, yo, I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like, "Look at that dude, '60, that motherfucker's too skinny"
I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But, from a stranger, it's something that I fucking hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to fuck off then fuck off
That's not being immature about it
That's me admitting I'm insecure about it
And yo I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain

[Refrain: 360]
But now it's got me thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain (I hope you don't mind)
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane (like I'm goin' insane)
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (let it all out, yeah)
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (let it all out, yeah)
Yeah
