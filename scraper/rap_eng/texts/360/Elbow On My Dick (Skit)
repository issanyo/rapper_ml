[Intro]
I got that swish dick, Andrew Gaze's extension
Swan neck on my dick
Yo

[Verse]
I got an elbow on my dick, yeah, an elbow on my dick
When I show it to a girl they're like, "Hello, what is this?"
And when it talks it says, "Hello, this is Six"
But you gotta understand, I got a elbow on my dick
Yeah, you mighta seen me in my battles, right?
Mightn't know my tracks, only know me as that battle guy
But see they never get their angles right
Talking 'bout my bent dick, at least it ain't angled right
Hey yo, look at this, Sixty got a crooked dick
Fucked your girl, wouldn't fit, all she did, took the tip
You think I give a fuck, homie? It is metre's large
When it comes to winter time, I love it, I don't need a scarf
Eiffel Tower, probably massive as that
And you just want it 'cause it's honestly happy and fat
Gotta be having a crack, but if I say
I'm going on a raging bender then I'm probably having a wank
Slap my elbow, slap my, slap my elbow
Shit is real curvy, looking like a bent cellphone
Stupid bitch, hell no's
Laughing, tickle me: Elmo
Uh, yeah, bitch we are on deck
Got a dick bent, looking like a fucking swans neck
Yo, it's the jump off, you don't like it? Fuck off
Check out my bent dick, Andrew Gaze's jump shot
Yeah, no chick is saying that "It's not for me"
You should see this shit, looking like a squatting knee
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
Yeah, I'm not bent, but my cock is
