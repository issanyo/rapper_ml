[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Verse 1: 360}
Yeah, sleeping on a fat yak
Unclean, yo I'm chillin' where the rats at
No shit dick, bigger than you've ever had
So damn big, you can't fit it in a back pack
Tried to post it on twitter though
Couldn't fit it in a hashtag
So I put it in a video
Better believe you couldn't fit it into snapchat
Put me first, never coming second no
I know that it's a long road, but I got a plane, any minute I'll be headed home
What happens now? Homie you will never know
Gonna receive it like a bad jester, so you gonna get beheaded though

[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Post-Hook: Miracle & 360]
Rolling 'round in my city
Eddie Jones
Eddie Jones

[Verse 2: 360]
(Fuck it) I barely have used my incredible bath
(Fuck it) whenever I want I can get in my spa
(Fuck it) The bitches all drop when my engine'll start
Glen Rice my sex drive, spend every night getting head in a car
(Fuck it) Tall; lanky, like Shawn Bradley, they fallen short
(Fuck it) They can't start me, I'm Dan Marjerle from quarter court
(Fuck it) A buffalo but I dunk so sick
Leave me the fuck alone, â€˜cos you're Muggsy Bogues to Mutumbo bitch

[Hook: 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Verse 3: Miracle]
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who the illest of them all?
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who the illest of them all?
Rolling 'round in my city, still haven't paid my rego
Got your girlfriend with me and she'll do anything I say so
Huh, I'm the leader of the new wave
Gold chains I'ma new slave
Putting rappers in a new grave
Eddie Jones, I ball like a toopee
Better call the ambo
Black Rambo
Never out of ammo
Rocking camo
Two lowies in the van though
Takes two to tango
So I humped twice like a camel

[Hook: Miracle & 360]
Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

[Outro: Miracle (360)] x2
Rolling 'round in my city
Still haven't paid my rego (Eddie Jones)
Got your girlfriend with me
And she'll do anything I say so (Eddie Jones)
