[Verse 1: 360]
The shit is pear-shaped, this is a final straw
You had a good thing goin’, look at this life of yours
Yo, we’ve lost the plot, what are we fightin’ for?
We need to come together, but they divide us more
I’ve been at rock bottom, it’s cold and nothin’s there
I know you must be scared but it’s only up from here
It’s time to knuckle down and get a handle on it though
‘Cause anytime you fail that becomes a chance for you to grow
Make the hatred that you hear from your Satan disappear
From that devil on your shoulder to an angel in your ear
And grab life by the horns and never stumble through
When they say dream on, that’s exactly what you fuckin’ do

[Pre-Chorus: Teischa]
I hope things will come
Together, 'cause I’m
Runnin’ out of ways to go and I’m under
Pressure

[Chorus: Teischa]
‘Cause I’m tryna find a way out
But there’s somethin’ in the way now
But I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Verse 2: 360]
You need to show 'em you can do it, you got somethin' to prove
'Cause if you lost everythin' that means there's nothin' to lose (uh)
When you finally believe that it's a blessin' just to feel
They say you can't, that just reaffirms you definetly will
(Yeah, you will) It's your time, it's all right, remember that
Shake off [?] that dust now, what you once had you'll get it back
Never thinkin' what you coulda been, what you shoulda been
'Cause you never listened when they told you what you couldn't be
It's time to leave and climb up the wall
And when you reach the top don't be frightened to fall
You can't believe it while you're speechless at the height of it all
Don't be afraid, just admire it more, you found a way out

[Chorus: Teischa]
‘Cause I’m tryna find a way out
But there’s somethin’ in the way now
But I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Post-Chorus: Teischa]
And I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’
No, I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Bridge: 360]
I know this ain't even really where you wanna be
Ain't no reason you should give 'em an apology
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
I know this ain't even really where you wanna be
Ain't no reason you should give 'em an apology
Let go, let go
Let go, let go

[Pre-Chorus: Teischa]
I hope things will come
Together, 'cause I’m
Runnin’ out of ways to go and I’m under
Pressure

[Chorus: Teischa]
‘Cause I’m tryna find a way out
But there’s somethin’ in the way now
But I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’, keep on runnin’

[Post-Chorus: Teischa]
And I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’
No, I’m not layin’ down, layin’ down, layin’ down
For nothin’
