[Chorus 1]
They always fantasise on stepping up
But see, I understand, I know why
But you can go ahead and get prepared
But acting like you're never scared, buddy, don't lie
'Cause see they always coming up to me
They tryna find a angle but go ahead and just dig away

[Verse 1]
But what I'm saying is to dig your grave
'Cause coming up against 360, you better get afraid
You're gonna leave here with more than just your ego bruised
You'll kill yourself, or come close like that Keynote dude
You retarded losers, you ain't got the heart to do it
See I've been ninja fighting, yo, I got the scar to prove it
You a pussy, I can tell when I look at you
And keep on saying what you want because I'm bulletproof
And what that means is that you can't get a bullet through
Honestly, if I was you then trust me, yo, I wouldn't shoot
Yo, you can try and risk it, but you will die from this shit
And we will film the whole thing so you can find a witness
I see him trying, I don't know the reason for it
I guess they wanna die, either that or seem important

[Chorus 2]
Yo, you can go toe-to-toe with me
And I'ma kill you while I look you in the eye
I ain't even gonna try
And you ain't even got a chance, no
And you can go away and train for years
But my advice is you probably shouldn't try
Or else you're gonna die

[Verse 2]
Yeah, homie, I can be prepared, yeah
I can do it all with people there
Faggot, yo, I ain't afraid, keep giving your evil stare
You see the people placing judgement, I control them dudes
You see the crowd that keeps surroundin', I control them too
You must be stupid, you expecting to win
I'm in the best mind-frame that I have ever been in
Yo, I'm a killer, yo, this is me confessing my sins
And, yo, I've mastered this, so, homie, let the lessons begin
And some have said that I've been beaten but it's still not true
Go and gimme anybody, yo, I will not lose
That ain't arrogance, it's confidence, so go ahead and try, bro
But break a leg, motherfucker, I hope you die slow

[Chorus 3]
It's the need to succeed, so you gonna die
They call police, 'cause of 3 and his homicides
They wanna be what they see and they wanna fight
But, yo, I gotta give respect because they wanna try
So let it just be known, if you stepping you will
Definitely go up to Heaven or they're sending you below
I should probably leave these centipedes alone
While they hearing this noise while I'm stepping on their home, like

[Bridge]
Uh, yeah, yeah
That's the noise of me picking up a building and throwing it to the sun type shit
Or having my way with the limousine and not calling it back
Motherfucker, uh

[Outro]
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
