[Intro: Daniel Johns (360)]
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Na na na na na na na na)
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Na na na na na na na na)
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You love it, you love it
You love it (Ha ha ha ha)
(Yo, yeah)

[Verse 1: 360]
Coming to terms that I might become a blind guy
If I do I'll only ever look on hindsight
Yeah, but if I do lose my eyesight
I don't give a fuck cause I'll be looking through my mind's eye
If there is a God, can I get a life-line?
With my vision now I'm forced to look on the bright side
Feel like my life is a really short timeline
So I smoke on cloud nine, die watching time fly
I've played so many incredible shows
But because I'm so fucked I don't remember 'em though
Fear is an emotion that none of us should be scared of
If you need help, play this and it'll wear off

[Refrain: Daniel Johns]
Don't wanna talk about it baby
It's just a needle in the hay
And I can feel nothing lately
Anytime, anywhere, for anything

[Chorus: Daniel Johns & 360]
We take drugs to fake love
We gotta get our shit together
Impossible, Yeah!
We're playing numb to stay strong
We gotta keep ourselves together
Impossible

[Verse 2: 360]
Listen, Yeah
I gave music a wedding ring
And I'm willing to have nothing so I can have everything
Got an A&R calling me a junkie
When he barely even knows me so who is he to judge me?
Yeah, yo I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin'
In a dream I don't have to sleep in to be in
Plus now my budget, probably ain't the best
For a young self-destructive, unhealthy fuck-wit
Alcohol, sex, caffeine and ciggies too
Shit, what haven't I been addicted to?
If you're with me then reach for the sky
Pour a drink and celebrate that we're even alive, yeah

[Refrain: Daniel Johns]
Don't wanna talk about it baby
It's just a needle in the hay
And I can feel nothing lately
Any time, anywhere, for anything

[Bridge: Daniel Johns]
I just wanna feel something baby
Another time, another day (baby)
But it's impossible to change me
Any time, in any way, for anything (baby)

[Chorus: Daniel Johns & 360]
We take drugs to fake love
We gotta get our shit together
Impossible, Yeah!
We're playing numb to stay strong
We gotta keep ourselves together
Impossible, woah oh
We take drugs to fake love
We gotta get our shit together
Impossible, Yeah!
We're playing numb to stay strong
We gotta keep ourselves together
Impossible

[Outro: Daniel Johns (360)]
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Na na na na na na na na)
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Na na na na na na na na)
You love it, you love it
You love it, you love it (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You love it, you love it
You love it (Ha ha ha ha)
