[Intro: 360]
Yeah, yeah
360, PEZ
Forthwrite, uh
I paint an image with words
I paint an image with words
I paint an image with words
I paint an image with words
Grab the pen and paint an image with words, like

[Chorus: 360]
Yo, it's the artist you'll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are sent to me
Yo, it's the artist you'll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are sent to me

[Verse 1: 360]
It's like, wake up, pursue the mental paintbrush
Each work unique, never the same stuff
Pain, love, or anything that comes to the heart
Any story told from any brush of the art
Expression from an innocent soul
The main source on our history's told
It goes back in the days (What?)
When they were covered in mud
Paint the story while they’re trapped in a cave
With no easel, no structure, no payment
No signature to recognise what their name is
No claims, just a form of expression
Send a message, it’s all for a lesson
For the future, telling a story and how it used to
Be, now people are aligning to see
And what’s it worth? Tell us what the price is
Their memories can’t be sold or told because they’re priceless

[Chorus: 360 & PEZ]
Yo, it’s the artist you’ll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are sent to me (Yeah, uh)
Yo, it’s the artist you’ll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are sent to me

[Verse 2: PEZ]
[?] slow storm, words that won't form
Before there's a verse, at first, a flow's born
Which you, in turn, interpret, hope, pause in bursts
And shows words with work that pros forms (Yeah)
Then reforms, what can I say?
There's no win or gift, the decision's already made
Our only job is envision a pen and page engaged
And then allow 'em all the power to flow
High from the sky it provides a connection
Eyes are the guide for direction, uh
Express your source, thoughts and confessions sought
It’s all to profess the cause and enforce
What you receive from the plot you conceive
It’s what you believe not just what you can see (Yeah)
You concede once a rhyme is complete
Go to sleep, wake up and let the cycle repeat, repeat

[Chorus: PEZ]
Yo, it's the artist you'll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are said to me
Yo, it's the artist you'll never see
Stroke the pen on the canvas, word paints his remedy
Stroke pictures and images with my energy
And speak out and paint words that are said to me
