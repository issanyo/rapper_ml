[Hook: 360]
Because you know, homie, you're gonna blow, homie
You need to pull it back out and go slow, homie
Go slow

[Verse 1: 360]
I heard about this dude who used to have a sick rep
But nowadays he’s only known for his sprint sex
He used to think he could have sex all day
But now he better start using less foreplay
Yo, is PEZ your name? (yep) Dude, yo, I know you
The same dude that puts it straight in then he blows (true)
At this rate, you’ll never have a permanent lady
I can’t figure out, you’re either nervous or crazy
You're fuckin' like a virgin, a baby
The bottom line is you need to learn from it
Maybe you should try and go and monitor
And analyse every thought you think about
‘Cause you’re like a microwave dinner – in and out
How can you not be mad, mad with what the ladies say?
You need to head towards for the chemist for that nasal spray
It’s a problem, you don’t amount to none
Maybe think of doing farm work when you're about to cum
Yeah, you used to have a rep like you were John Holmes
You need to take advice-vice homie, fuck slow
And when you're fuckin' and you're feeling like you're gon' blow
Take your penis out and let your fingers squeeze your nob closed

[Hook: 360]
Fuck slow, homie
And grab your testicles hard when you’re tapping that arse
And fuck slow, homie, you're gonna blow, homie
You need to pull it back out and go slow, homie
Go slow, go slow
Because you know, homie, you're gonna blow, homie
You need to pull it back out and fuck slow, homie

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Now, I’ve been listenin' and I'm hearin' what you're sayin'
But I like the way I root so I don’t really wanna change it
I understand your plan is tryna mediate
The situation at hand and I appreciate
You trying to help me through, but it won’t help, see (nup)
'Cause I'm a selfish dude (uh), it's all about me (ha ha)
Yeah, when I get a girl, I'm not trying to make her yell
I'm just trying to get the quickest nut I can like Dave Chappelle
See I'm a speed fucker, and when it's sex time
Right from the start, yo, I'm just tryna hit my best time
Forty seconds is my personal best
But with time, I hope to get it down to thirty or less, yes
It's that simple, as long as I can spit a verse this fuckin' well
Then, yo, I’m always gonna finish first
Maybe when I get older then I'll cum last
Until then, I’m in Forthwrite so I fuck fast

[Hook: PEZ]
And there's no time to waste, 'cause for me, it's a race
So fuck fast, homie, real fast, homie
If you want to compete then fuck fast, homie
Fuck fast
