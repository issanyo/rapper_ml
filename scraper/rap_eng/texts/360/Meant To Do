[Intro]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
I dunno what I want to do
And I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Verse 1]
See you know the girl, yeah, you know the type
Yo, she doesn't know the world, but she knows a fight
She wants a boyfriend now, go and have a closer look
Talk about a bad choice like she wrote the book
She been talking to this guy for a while and he wants in
But he's a nice guy, so she don't want him
But why is it that the ones that are bad for you
Always seem to be the ones she's attracted to
Yo, it's the same shit, yo, you have to chill
You turn a small thing into a massive deal
See you don't have to care but
We have a good week and then it's back to square one
In this life that you lead most the time
You just fight with the weak then you cry as the cycle repeats
But you don't think it's a problem
I guess the first step is admitting you've got one

[Interlude]
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Verse 2]
Yo, I don't know who you are, where'd you come from? (from)
Why you getting so mad, where's the love gone? (gone)
Why I feel like there's somethin' that I've done wrong? (wrong)
And why I feel like you're someone I should run from?
Hey, yo, it's endless
Listen to me, come on, I don't wanna punch on
I feel like I'm fighting myself with no gloves on
Why is it that the ones that are bad for me
Always seem to be the ones that are attracting me?
'Cause she love me, she love me
But why she always wanna fucking erupt me?
It's never me though, trust me, it must be you
'Cause you always turn nothin' into something
True, but you stay upset
Yo, I can't count each and every day I've left
I give it twenty-four hours till we break up next
But I guess it's all worth it for the make up sex

[Chorus (Condensed)]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
And I dunno what I want to do
That ain't all though, I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?

[Verse 3]
Living in the sex and the drugs and the rock and roll
I'll admit it, though, I lost control
I met a girl with a positive soul
She regretted that she ever went and got involved
Couldn't handle all the people talking
I let 'em keep going and I keep ignoring
I'm past those days always keeping score
And I said it and I meant it, that ain't me no more
They see the lights and it's seeming exciting
But see as time goes by it is blinding
But see I really, really want to meet wifey
But the way that I'm living ain't likely
Yeah, being a rapper ain't getting me far
I don't have a house or a pet or a car
I'm twenty-four living in my parents' garage
Safe to say that I'm off to a terrible start

[Chorus]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
And I dunno what I want to do
That ain't all though, I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

[Outro]
I dunno what I want to change
But I know I shouldn't stay the same
I dunno what I want to do
And I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad
What the fuck am I meant to do?
