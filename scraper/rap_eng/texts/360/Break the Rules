[Verse 1]
My author was R.L. Stine
Ch-ch-choose your own adventure
Dig deep and remove it from the centre
Do what you were sent for, something that it was meant for
You, look where you can end up
And when it ends up, who will you remember?
Me, go and set the trend for
Anyone who’s met ya, you will be the benchmark
We all on the starting five, you've secluded to the bench
Have a think, though, who are you to them?
Get ya arse up and remove it from the fence
My integrity says: “I can't get a job, never again
I do what I want and whenever I can
'Cause we only live once, in a second it ends”

[Hook]
See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t
See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t

[Verse 2]
There’s some new faces
We change the game but can you blame us?
All they care about is who’s famous
What true fame is, but fuck ‘em, game on
Who they kiddin'?
Fuck Facebook and new age critics
I'mma do it like Bruce Wayne did it
Get a new cape fitted ‘cause I do save innit
Is it gonna be a new age gimmick?
Is he gonna rap with 2 Chainz, eh-eh
How much can a dude make, millions
How do you think I bought a new plane, I did it
Now I really got a new place fitted
I ain’t stupid, I do save with it
Never gonna get it with a suitcase fitted
How you'll gonna know, though, if you ain’t in it?
Forget it, go and get prepared
Fuck fear, we ain’t never scared
I know what'll get us there
Like "fuck it, we’re already there"

[Hook]
See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t
See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t
See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t

[Bridge]
It's a cruel game, huh?
Fuck what you made up
We’re tryna break some rules
Before the rules break us, fuck it
Fuck what you made up
Fuck what you made up
We’re tryna break some rules
Before the rules break us
It's a cruel game, huh?
Fuck what you made up
We’re tryna break some rules
Before the rules break us, fuck it
Fuck what you made up
Fuck what you made up
We’re tryna break some rules
Before the rules break us
