[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah

[Verse 1: 360 & Pez]
Yeah, here's the dream, I want to go for it
Doubt's got me feeling so cautious
See my folks thought I should probably let it go cause
I'll have nothing to show for it
That's when I told six back in '04
I know we can make it, I'm so sure
I know it's just us [?] if it fucks then we both fall
But we won't, alright P, just leave it with me
I know I got a job, but I'll leave it quickly
I gotta say thanks for believing in me
'Cause hearing you made a believer in me
That's all that I needed 60
All these other people just reason with me
Always trying tell me be realistic
But I can't so please forgive me

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego (Pez)]
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh—oooh (ayy, I apologise)
If I seem naive
I would never want to (I just really feel this is meant to happen you know?)
Force your hand (uh)
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah

[Verse 2: 360 & Pez]
See it took a few songs to get a bit of buzz
Come to think we'd forever live it up
As if to say we'd already lit it up
But you can't have everything at once
We can't just live what we think in our thoughts
We're gonna have to dig till we dig to the core, or
Everything that we're ever gonna give
I'll only ever wanna give a little more, more
Now we got a lot of push behind it
We ain't even gonna look behind us
There's a place that is put inside us
And now we're both knowing where to look to find it (yeah)
See we don't need a book to guide
But it can act as good reminder
Why're you acting we could well find our dream
'Cause I know that we should, that's why I

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego (360)]
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
If I seem naive (yeah)
I would never want to (we got this)
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah

[Verse 3: 360 & Pez]
See there's times where you're hiding
Times where your mind isn't clear
See even though you're excited, feeling inspired
Still you get blinded by fear
Now we got it yo, it's finally here
Can't believe it, it's like we've been fighting
For years, there's no better timing
It's been an upwards climb our entire career
See these people, they all around ya
No matter what you do they're gonna always doubt ya
See the haters wanna call us out, but
Compared to the love they're a small amount, uh
That's the reason we keep our distance
We know who we are, we don't need to listen
They're always gonna feel the need to diss
But they don't mean it so please forgive them

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
If I seem naive
I would never want to
Force your hand
Oh-oh-oh—oooh
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
Oh-wow-wo-woah
