[Ad-lib]
Let's go

[Hook]
Yo I came here to collect
Came here to collect
We don't wanna hang around yo we came here to collect
We came here to collect

[Verse]
Aye, we know how to steal a show yo take it from the best homie
Follow my lead, you ain't taking it again from me
I am in the zone playing at my best, yo we push the game forwards
Why you staying on the fence homie
You ain't even hopping off at all
Got the jump in real life you barely make it to the net
Working background crew but you staying with the press
Only work the front that's why you staying on the bench
Yo the game's nearly finished, you ain't playing in it yet
The baller that you think you are is made up in your head
You made up millis when you were making a percent
You ain't paving a way homie you paving the cement
Put your money where your mouth is
I'm aiming for you head boy
The deal you got is barely paying for your rent boy
How you number one you ain't stadium yet
You just post it up on Facebook, creating an event boy
I call the shots, if I say it then it's in
Money off the glass then I'm banking it again
Take the money that you score and start bragging to your friends
Take the points off the board, you ain't having them again
Whole team took an L, you should take it for your friend
But instead of taking blame you just naming all of them
Start owning your mistakes instead of blaming on the rest
Taking charge like a man, stop blaming the offense
You ain't dropping out of anywhere, save it for the net
I didn't come here to be your friend, I came here to collect
In a matter of a day you get taken by the feds
And in the matter of an hour you get...
