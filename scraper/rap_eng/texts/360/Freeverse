[Intro]
Argh (Straight to your face), yeah
I haven’t been pissed off in a while (360, what?)
I’ve been doing that funny [?]
(Haha, This ain’t fun though bitch)
Something’s buggin’ me right now
This ain’t directed at no one, but
This is the kind of shit I write when I’m in this mind state
Yo, yo

[Verse]
The ex-apprentice MC, yo I learnt from the best one
If I go and make commitments to my work, then it gets done
Queens Bridge slang, yo, this verse is the best done
How long it takes me to start earning respect, done
Yo, your journey’s a fenced one
If you’re the last of a dying breed, then I’m the first of the next one
The fathers of rap will get a permanent chest bump
I stared down ya kid and now he’s turned to a step son
I’m [?], pennin’ the best sentences
And sexin’ all the sexiest breasts while you're text messaging
And all the feminists sendin’ me death threats
Well, then I’m steppin’ in the flesh while these peasants are FedExin’ 'em ([?])
I’ll show you how my words are endless
Because I’m known to serve a sentence like they found me with a murder weapon
I’ll show you how my words are endless
Because I’m known to serve a sentence like they found me with a murder weapon

[Outro]
Yeah, uh, sloppy mixing
When you’re in this state, you could give two fucks
Yah
