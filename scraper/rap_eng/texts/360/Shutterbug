[Intro - 360]
Yo, Please Be Seated bitches
Number two bitches, what up bitch

[Verse 1 - 360]
Yo I don't understand your shit yo explain it first
Nerd rappers need to rap in Layman's Terms
For me though it's fuck safety first
It goes alcohol, drugs then safety's third
In the last months I have fuckin' wrecked shit
I'm a ball breaker, pun intended
I'll bust ya head 'til none forget this
Don't come correct then you'll come corrected
Fuck the world go unprotected
Keep on going until it's fucking pregnant
I am never early
If i'm booked in at 6 then expect 360 at 7:30
Hey yo bitch cook me some eggs
And if they ain't runny fuckin' cook 'em again
The last time I got stuck in a booby trap
Yo I was like "where the fuck are the boobies at?"
And this is how I be livin' in tune with rap
But why you gotta get rude with that
Cause these hoes on my dick, cause I'm lookin' like Ted Danson
Maybe so but Teddy is less handsome
I used to wake up first thing blaze up
Yo my taste buds only ever taste bud
And me and Mary had a break up
See I didn't want to but I didn't get the same buzz
Sick of living like a king for two days
Then spend the next fortnight living off loose change
I think I need a new name
Because I ain't made for living underground like Bruce Wayne
Uh this the definition of Aussie swag
I got the crown come get me if you want it back
360 rocking over Shutterbug
Because I, I, I am a funny cunt

[Hook]
Now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbugs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy stop, I'm just playing let me dap you up
Baby baby, you're in my system
Baby baby, tell me you're listening

[Verse 2 - GMC]
I said fuck you dickhead this is me styling
Callin' you inferior and this is me dialing
I own this microphone
So go fuck yourself, yo like my tone
Back I'ma fuck you [?] ignant
I don't even know who the fuck you is
Non-discriminatory
High on skill my flow got me feeling euphoric
It's GMC so guaranteed this speed gonna need a burial for it
Now I don't skeet watch me go ahead
And do a bunch of motherfucking aerials off it
I stunt with the flow, nobody double lead it
Write my own shit, like Robby Rodriguez
Ride my own dick, like I lovin' my penis
Also in love with Rosario Dawson
Things I'd do to Rosario Dawson
Would both be scary and awesome, Miranda Kerr
That's the question that I answer first
But then I gotta big load and I hand it to her
Buckle your seat belt, motherfucker
You buckle your seat belt now
Sending you like an email now
Ladies and gentlemen please be seated
Tres-seis-cero and GMC

[Hook]
