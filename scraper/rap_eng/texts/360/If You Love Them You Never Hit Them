[Verse 1: 360]
Yo, I wanna know how you feel man
What you think you a real man
What about your children
This shit right here's gonna kill them
Thought she married a goody
But she married a bully
Fuck that, yo she married a pussy
A real man never puts his hands on a woman
No way is it okay, whether male or female it goes both ways
It doesn't matter who's the higher rate
You never touch somebody in a violent way
You're so alone though, you might die if you don't go
See it's hard to take, you can't escape
It's like you're imprisoned in your own home
One second you get a nice kiss
The next you might get a right fist
It could be any night
You knew he had a temper
But never like this
What a monster he's turned into
Now mentally you're turning too
It's not just hurting you
If you don't leave know he might murder you
You thought you were gonna be great
Now you wanna escape
But you're scared as shit
You're afraid of the dark
And the darkness right now is where you live
You don't need to be brave
Stop leaving it be
Your kids are the reason you stay
But they need to be the reason you leave
That's it you've got to leave
I hope they don't understand what they see
And if they do understand
Then I hope they view him as what not to be
I believe it's time for peace
Here's some words a wife will need
You got to know that abuse is the issue
As soon as he hits you its time to leave
Never knew he was crazy as this
Feel so trapped no escaping this shit
It ain't about taking a hit
He'll say anything just to make you forgive
No apology will ever change what he did
Can't ever take back braking your ribs
You gotta do it for the sake of the kids
So they know it ain't cool to be raising their fist

[Hook: 360]
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them

[Outro: Sia (sampled)]
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
I've lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
