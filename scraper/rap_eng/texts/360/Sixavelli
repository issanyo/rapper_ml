[Verse 1: 360]
I'm at the Kwik-E-Mart to find where the Simpsons are
I got money to give Bart 'cause he ticked me shard (come again)
Yo, someone tell me where the strippers are
I get it poppin' like throwin' ninja stars in a titty bar
It might be a bit bizarre
But I'm at my best friends funeral I'm cryin', but my dick is hard
My mate showed me his minibar (check out my minibar)
I couldn't stop askin' the cunt where the fuckin' midgets are
Last week, I bought a Nixon mask
Stole Bill Clinton's car and drove it into Monica Lewinsky's spa
My girlfriend's a Gypsy with a job to do
I'll sign your CD, she'll rob your shoes and your wallet too
Drive by in a Commodore, ride right to the bottle shop
Rock tie die, no knife fights I'm a white guy with a tomahawk
Pause and ask the owner if he knows the fuckin' soccer score
If our team's losing then we're fuckin' up his shop some more

[Hook: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yeah, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah, I got it by mistake

[Verse 2: 360]
I think from all the benders I've rocked and all the ecstasy popped
I suffer memory loss which means I don't remember a lot (what's that mate?)
I like machetes because it's the weapon I've got
Use it start connect the dots and your freckles and spots
Even when I'm not right I'll never be wrong
I'm levels beyond, on a level that you won't ever be on
I take a photo of how Jesus died and I'll text it to God
Message across
I got a question for God, if we got the first Testament wrong
Tell us where we got the second one from
Yo from this day I never will flop, you want proof?
I'll stab the end of my cock with this adrenaline shot
Hey yo, my cock is a Cyclops, got Nikes on and they're high tops
Meet you then tell you that your girl got a nice box
Everything I do in life is quite wrong
Need an apple a day, so I stole your fuckin' iPod

[Hook: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
And I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
And I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

[Verse 3: Lunar C]
I getting it in when I get in the ring
It's a left right to the chin, I side step then I swing
Got two bisexual identical twins
In my ride, dressed up as gimps on a wild ketamine binge
Getting more head than forceps
You get T-bagged for sleepin', I let my balls rest on ya forehead
If you're wondering why I haven't said pause yet
And presumin' I'm talking about a dude then you're bent
Speakin' at the court hearing naked, with my balls shaven
That's what I call a bald statement
Whole world on my shoulders, didn't think that I could balance it
But it's lighter than you think like Michael Jackson's kids
You don't know where the fuck you been, from Bradford to Melbourne we run this thing
Took your chick to go fuck but the slut just sucked my dick till she bust a lip
Fuck what I said before, I ain't got no money bitch
Girls call me an arsehole 'cause I'm tight as fuck and full of shit

[Hook: Pancho]
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
And I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
And I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
