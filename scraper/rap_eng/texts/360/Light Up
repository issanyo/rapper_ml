[Intro]
All right, are you recording?
All right, yo, uh

[Verse]
I ain't invisible, I'm giving you the real me
So put your hand out, I want you to feel me
Really, listen while I'm gettin' on that honesty tip
Yo, pretend there's no beat and let me talk for a bit
If being honest and only going off skill alone
Fuck it, we better hurry up and build a throne
Promoters booking us for gigs, but we billed below
You see we ain't the main acts, but we steal the show
I feel we're the best and yeah, I know this country want it
I know we joke a bit but I'm being fucking honest
And with my friends lately I'm a little bit distant
The music that I'm making is a little bit different
I locked myself away to make a masterpiece
Open up my heart and I'm giving you a part of me
Now the singles, I hope we picked the right one
Try and run with the best to represent what I have done
And understand it's so important that the radio plays it
It can make it or break it, what I'm basically sayin' is
That I ain't tryna cater to a market
I'm tryna be creative as an artist
And if you don't feel what I felt it's all good, homie
'Cause I keep it real yo, real to myself
Yo, this is what I wanna do yo, listen dog
This is me, why would I write it for you, huh?
Don't get me wrong though, I ain't hatin' boom bab
Yes, I am a fan of that, but I ain't gonna do that
I knew when I was making this I would cop flack
But I stand behind what I'll do so I'll cop that
And friends sayin' I should diss dudes on track
But see I'm twenty-four now, I'm beyond that
But see, I gotta leave my ego at the door
So from now on I ain't gonna see 'em anymore
Peace
