[Intro: Gary Clark]
Pray for the love of the children
I pray for the ones that have killed them
I pray, but I don't know who to pray to
Help me to understand

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
It’s like hate’s been popularised
Love turns to hate at the drop of a dime
I’ve seen my own fans crossin’ a line
But if they’re fans of hate, I don’t want ‘em as mine
It’s got me confused, yo, I’m not gonna lie
I've got Muslim friends, they don’t want me to die
They ain’t tryna build a mosque to provide
A place where they can go and build bombs and to hide
Look, a burka is not a disguise
It’s foreign to you, so it’s a shock in your mind
All you need to do is spend some quality time with ‘em
To know they just wanna live a positive life
See, that’s the nature of human kind
In a life they just [?]
They see a war goin’ on and they wanna survive
And not see their whole family get hospitalised
It’s got ‘em thinkin’ everythin' that Islam is
Where every Muslim's a terrorist, a Jihadist
And every Westerner is a target
But look at ISIS, America is who armed ‘em
And they plantin’ the seed of the fear in the street
So when you see a man with a beard you retreat
Got you scared of a face full hair, but what’s makin’ him
Ain’t what he wears it is really beneath
I understand though, we have to discuss it
All the progress is actually nothin’
We wanna live in peace, but the shit in the middle east
Is still goin’ on where the acts are disgusting
If you ever raise a fact on the subject
All we ever do is attack and get upset
If you wanna evolve and help the problems to solve
Stop bickerin’ and have the discussion
What a joke, people killin’ each other
Over a book, and they suffer a lot for land
I love some of the scriptures, but fuck a religion
‘Cause I’m suddenly thinkin’ that I’m askin’

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, the scriptures are full of lots of knowledge
But I feel like it’s misunderstood
It’s easy to misjudge a book
When people start killin’ in it’s name, then it did nothin’ good
I’m not saying that I’m right at all
I’m just speakin’ my mind, I wish others would
But it grew from a cult to a big brotherhood
Where you do what you’re told though, ‘cause big brother looks
As far as religion’s concerned
I hate to see the innocent's hurt
Hundreds of years of abuse towards kids in a church
And still Islam is considered the worst?
We can’t go back, the damage is done
Compassionate is what we have to become
I don’t blame all the catholics for what was actually done
You don’t taint a whole group for the actions of some
Instead of worshiping a power that’s higher
We need to understand that the power’s inside us
The hours in time are allowed to remind us
Any goodness within you, allow it to guide ya
If I’m wrong, then I trust He’ll forgive
Everything I say comes from love from within
Stop lookin’ down on others who sin
And if you do believe in God, leave the judgement to Him

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
The trouble with God
The trouble with God
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

[Bridge: Gary Clark]
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Outro: 360]
What I’m sayin’ isn’t definite, right
I ain’t sayin’ what you fed was a lie
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me, I just can’t go accept that it’s right
The core to religion’s fundamentally right
And the Bible might work as a general guide
But a story that’s told over centuries
Surely it's eventually gonna get embedded with lies

[Reversed Audio: 360]
I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me
I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me
