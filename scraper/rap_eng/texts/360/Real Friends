[Verse]
Have you ever not trusted yourself?
Or wished that you were somebody else?
Like you're barefoot running through hell?
There's nothing worse than a messy junkie with endless money
Especially one on an empty stomach that's getting hungry
I seem good, but lately I've been better, trust me
Tears up on a steel frame and I'm getting rusty
I'm from a good home, I'm knowing that my parents loved me
But it's like my dog's the only one who'll never judge me
One year clean, something that is hard to get
I give it everything, I put my fucking heart in this
You wanna know the hardest bit I nearly can't admit?
'Cause when I do I'm feeling like an narkie bitch
'Cause when I'm seeing friends I used to party with
I've had to cut ties 'cause I'm feeling like I can't resist
When you get clean, it's not drugs you've parted with
Friends and lifestyle are just as much a part of it
See I would love to catch up and have lunch
But when I see you, I just wanna rack up and that's fucked
Stop being angry and fucking mad
Are you a loose end, because a true friend would understand
Never force the progression of a soul
Give me time, let me get it in control
I'm doing well for someone that was never in control
Doing well for someone that was never in control
Let me get a hold on it and then we can evolve (Yeah)
See the devil on my shoulder's now embedded on my soul
Real friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me you want the tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on the FaceTime
Even when we was young we used to make time
Now we be way too fucked up to make time

[Chorus]
Ever fucked with real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, and throw dirt on him
I guess I get what I deserve
