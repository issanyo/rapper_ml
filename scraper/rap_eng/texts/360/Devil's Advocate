[Intro: Esoterik]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round as you will witness a story to be told. You will not see me coming, but mark my words, you will feel me inside you, for you are I, and I are you *Laughs Maniacally*

[Ad-Libs]
Fuck yeah
Uh
Uh-ah uh-ah-ah, uh-ah uh-ah ah—ah

[Chorus (Partial)]
Because I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Verse 1]
You won’t see me the flesh, only ever in the mind (nup)
Which means I’m in the flesh, but it's the head that I’m inside (yep)
You'll never see a better vessel ever been designed (nup)
Everywhere you look you’ll see a devil in disguise (yes)
The mind that I’m inside, yo, I try it on for size (let's go?)
If I’m liking it, then I just might just commit a crime
(Kinda suits me, ayy?) Then rightfully it's mine, if you with ya mates
And hear “Speak of the devil” that means I finally arrived (I'm here)
I might be in ya mind, but I’m dead forever (always)
And if there’s hell to pay then I’m the motherfucking debt collector
(Give me your fucking money) Last year sat on Seth Sentry's deltoids
Helped him write a song called "Hell Boy"
(You are so full of shit) I’ve never felt joy
And I don’t speak much, the last time I said hello
You heard it in Adele's voice (from the other side)
'Cause of me heavens gates are ruined
If I’m in ya mind then you'll never make it through 'em (nup)
Every time the coppers find a death and they pursue it
Yo, the killers last words were "The devil made me do it"
But God made earth in seven days, bitch
It's been a pleasure to fuck it up every day since
I’m here to bring a balance to your mental health (yep)
I'll make you feel the worst that you’ve ever felt (I will, I will)
I’m the worst card the earth has been ever dealt
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

[Chorus]
In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like "Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why"
'Cause I'm raising hell (raising, raising hell)
It ain't gonna raise itself (raise it—raise itself)
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Verse 2]
I went motherfuckin' undercover, as an alter boy in the bell choir (yep)
Just to swap all the holy water with hell fire (fire)
I might look like Voldemort but I smell nicer
Lost the plot more than an older author with alzheimers
(Where am I?) I choked out Soulja Boy with a belt, right
Farted on his son then sold his daughter to Al-Qaeda
The advocate, not the devil himself
I was sent here to help, a senator ascended from hell (I'm here)
The opportunity presented itself
I couldn’t say no, 'cause down there is sweaty as... well
I’m why America's wealth's in debt to itself
And Kennedy fell, and nine-eleven as well
They bombing kids aged eleven and twelve and blame a terrorist cell
And never mention all the oil that they gettin' as well
Fathered George Bush, raised him well (yep)
I had him on the right path by the age of twelve (I did)
But I’m ruthless, the motherfucking truth is
When he was fifty-four’s when I really started raising hell (kill 'em)
The devil's never been red before with a set of horns
With a pointy tail and a motherfuckin' metal fork (nah)
You’ve been lied to, everything you’ve ever thought
The devil is the banker with the money funding every war (facts)
When I’m around you’re inclined to write FML
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

[Chorus]
In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like "Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why"
'Cause I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

[Spoken]
Now watch all these fucking cunts in Youtube comments say that I'm in the Illuminati and shit, 'cause I started dropping videos on the sixth of the sixth, and the Spotify playlist is Six. "That means he must be Illuminati." I fucking wish I was, cunt. Pay off this fucking mortgage

[Outro]
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
