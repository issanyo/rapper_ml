[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Get out your memory hats
We're going back, uh, yeah
Get out them brain photos
Try and think back
It might be different to you but this is my old school
It's 360, with M-Phazes
Reminiscin' shit, check it out

[Verse 1]
Yo, with the video games, playin' GoldenEye on 64
I swear I coulda played that game till I was sixty-four
Or Double Dragon or maybe playin' Ninja
Turtles workin' the whole time on savin' Splinter
Young discos, it's funny when you have a dance
And not afraid to leave your house rockin' happy pants
Yo, I love to make my family proud
That's why I rock free dress days in hand-me-downs
And watchin' TV, hated A Country Practice
I chilled by myself watching Monkey Magic
Or maybe SuperTed, Eric the Bananaman
Rockin' down to Granny May's and checkin' out the lava lamps
"Smells Like Teen Spirit", I was a Nirvana fan
Ridin' down to the milk bar in my pyjama pants
For Bubble-O Bills and a stack of Warheads
Or maybe meetin' with mates to throw a Vortex
And Transformers was classic with Optimus Prime
When Megatron killed him, yo, I honestly cried

[Refrain]
It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

[Chorus]
I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts? (uh)

[Verse 2]
I was a fiend for the basketball, preachin' that I had a dream
Every month I'd buy a One on One magazine
Dreams of meetin' Michael Jordan in 3D
The closest I came was Come Fly With Me in Three-Peat
And with the hip-hop, it happened in grade six
Me and mates writin' down the credits from skate vids
Method Man to Smith and Wesson [?] the stages
My first hip-hop CD was 36 Chambers
And Michael Jackson, my definite best age
Obsessin' to press play and wreckin' cassette tapes, like
"Smooth Criminal" and "Thriller" and "Bad"
I watched his movie, I was glad I didn't live with his dad
And with any type of music you're forever learnin'
And a Midnight Oil fan, yo, my head would turn for Beds Are Burnin'
And when it come to Slim Shady I'm a real addict
Big L to Nas, 'cause Illmatic is still classic
Every item of clothing was bought at Kmart
But it'd always get ripped down at the skatepark

[Refrain]
It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

[Chorus]
I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts?

[Outro]
Hahaha, yeah
That's my old school, it's 360
