[Intro]
Hey, Lleyton
I've been told a couple of times that I look like you, right?
Now, I don't mind that
But, in my opinion, I deserve Bec a lot more than you do
I've put in more ground work, I've been there a lot longer
And I love work a lot more than you do
So, I think it's time to give her up
Please!

Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it

[?] Mamma Mia
Yeah, this one's for Snuzzleberry
That's my pet name I gave her

[Verse 1]
Yo, I remember watching this girl on Home and Away
Wouldn't miss an episode if I was home or away
I really wanna put my little hands up in her bra
While I'm glancing at her arse, watching Dancing With The Stars
Little Aussie queen I define, how's that?
I really love the way you get them eyebrows waxed
You'll see me every year, lurking in the grandstand
Eyes locked on Bec while the rest of the fans chant
This whole time, I've been dreaming of a lap dance
I'll show Lleyton the true meaning of a backhand (take that motherfucker)
And, really, he should be an honest register
As a non-competitor that could never beat Roger Federer
And I'll be honest though, Australia's hoping
For Lleyton to stay away from the Australian Open
(Nah, you can't come in) He wants to slap me? He better get the stilts out
She was hot before, guess what?, she's a milf now

(I see you every year at the Oz Open)
Please look at me next time!

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's like every year at the Oz Open, I'm feeling loneliness
Switch up my style every time, hoping that she notices
And, last year, I thought I'd go in as a chauvinist
Pull the helicopter out and yell "Please notice this!"
I find pictures of her, surfing the net
Or you'll see me on the main court, surfing a net
And, everywhere she goes, you'll see be perving on Bec
I'll lurk under steps if she's in a skirt or a dress
I'm sorry Bec but I'm really jealous of Lleyton
I've seen you cook breakfast, I was smelling the bacon
I died when I found that you were marrying Lleyton
But I like cornflakes (that's an irrelevant statement)
You've got the worst voice for a TV host
I'd still let you talk on my CD though
Everybody can see it, even BP knows
We all agree, you need to break up with that peewee, yo

(I dream about you every night
But you don't love me, you don't love me)

[Verse 3]
I was with Bec Cartwright in my bed last night
The dream was so good that I slept past nine
But, when it comes to really having sex, I'm fine
I've got my Woman's Weekly magazine when I have a dream
Mamma Mia, the mother of Mia
Could turn me from a Satan to a mother Teresa
We'll get food nasty, having fun with a pizza
I'll be your only lover if you chuck me a Visa
Cheesy but true, sleasy but smooth
I'll show you another sport that's easy to do
Yeah, so what? I use a mic and not a tennis racket
But you could get a real rock star like Lenny Kravitz
Yeah, it's true that I like celebrity types
Because the TV bimbos are what kept me alive
And now, I've got my sights locked on Jennifer Kye
Why? 'Cause Greg Norman said the sex was all right

[Outro]
All those celebrity females, watch out
That's my whole thing, that's all I'm about
That's the only reason I rap, is so I can get closer to you guys
At the awards nights
Lara Bingle, Bec Cartwright, Kerri-Anne Kennerly
Fuck yeah, you're all gonna get it
It's all gravy Lleyton
Don't take offense, little boy
Come on!
