[Intro: 360 & DJ A-Style (Scratches)]
This is it
This is just too good to—to leave ya
I’m not going home [?]
You know I'm something to find
Because I'm one of a kind
3—3—3—360
The Alfred Hitchcock
The Alfred Hitchcock of Melbourne hip-hop
360
One of a kind

[Verse: 360]
Hey, yo, it’s me, myself, I, yeah, it’s '60 now
It mighta seemed like a dream since I’ve been around
I’ve been and found my feet, killin’ nouns and beats
I’m still a clown, don’t worry yo, I’m still around
I’ll only call Melbourne home when this album’s known
And I’m rockin’ sell-out shows down at Telstra Dome
I’ve felt I’ve grown, clear of all the yes man
It’s weird, my favourite MC's also my best friend
What up, PEZ? Man, I’m grateful you help me
That guidance that you gave me will be making us wealthy
This album’s fine and proud, straight from the underground
It’s got some uplifin’ shit for anyone who’s comin’ down
It’s my flow, mixed with lyrics that I write yo
People say their albums, but to me it’s like my bio
And from the crack of dawn it’s the same kid in the rap performance
Who ain’t afraid to rock a catchy chorus
And what I’m giving you, experience I’m livin’ through
Inspired by my own life and shit I listen to
And this is life, I’ll be rhymin’ 'til I’m 65
I make golden era hip-hop with a 60 vibe
I know you’re excited, but try and breathe and settle
Check all these tracks and get to know me on a deeper level
And stay positive, maybe [?] comedy
Whether deep reached or straight in your face honesty

[Outro: 360]
What you're seein’ is what ya get now
I stand my ground and I won’t be left out (Yeah, I’m pretty excited)
I still believe in myself to get proud (Yeah, yeah)
I’ll never let myself fall or step down (360)
What you're seein’ is what ya get now (Uh)
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
