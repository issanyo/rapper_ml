[Intro]
Ah, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
Funk, soul and hip-hop
Ain't nothing else you need, yeah
Yeah, let's have a bit of fun
Yo, check this out, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ayo, there's no set method, just kick back and sit and vibe
Crank the drums and jam out and improvise
Intertwine while you're kickin' it and listen live
Empty, it's better, it's evident when it's simplified
Respect those that've passed away
Like Marvin Gaye or even Jam Master Jay
We get tricky with a sexual healing
Same atmosphere as a festival feeling
I'll get respect while I'm skillin' for the wealth
With my headphones 'round my neck, chillin' by myself
This ain't business, see I started vibe and jam
And stay different, me? I'd rather ride a tram
The young silhouette, singing away
Now with the image set, killin' a bass so I can give you a taste
And have you tappin' feet, movin' with some goosebumps
And make your spine tingle, groovin' to the smooth drums

[Chorus]
Da da da da da da da
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
Stay doin' the funky bedroom
The funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'
Da da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
We keep the soul bangin'
And keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I lead stop, live in the spotlight
And go to any measurement you know I want high
The melody raps, I'm tellin' these cats
Irrelevant facts and takin' all their elements back
Ha, the young dude that'll laugh a lot
It's sort of funny that it's hard to stop, man, I'm hard to top
I stay livin' in a life that's so care-free
But don't dare me ever to vote fairly
Never be broke, barely make enough to survive
And that don't bother me at all, I'm still lovin' this life
I still love what I write, havin' fun on the mic
I still make enough money for a son and a wife
You know I'm somethin' to find because I'm one of a kind
I kill that rhythm and tilt back the mission
For another day (yeah) I'm encouraging a noisy time
Take the breaks off people, and enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
Da da da da da da da
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
Stay doin' the funky bedroom
The funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'
Da da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
We keep the soul bangin'
And keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away

[Outro]
Skip, bap, boobidy bap bap bap
Skippety bap bap bap bap bap
Skippety, bippety, bippety, bippety
Beep bap, boodoo, beep bap ba-boodoo (ha ha, yeah)
Stay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'
