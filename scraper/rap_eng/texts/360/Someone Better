[Intro: 360]
Ha-a-a-a-a-ah
Yeah yo, yeah
Sort of a song about sort of booty calls and shit
(Yo, yeah) Check it out, yo

[Verse 1: 360]
Hey yo, it's times like this when you really need to choose a song
To tell a girl the perfect way that you're moving on
I know it's harsh but you're doing nothing for me
And we were just helping each other out when we were horny (Yep) Don't get me wrong, yo, I really do respect women
But that don't mean that I don't wanna have sex with 'em
You broke the rules though, we had an agreement
From the start we agreed no attachments were needed (Come on)
But I'm the one that's stupid for the fact I believed it
I was about sex, and your attraction was deeper though
We wanted sex though with no strings attached
And you say you love me, what kind of no strings is that?
Yo, I think you're really cool and you know you're mad fine
But to fall in love, yo, I think you picked a bad time (You did)
And the fact that you weren't down for whatever
I know it's pretty harsh but I've found someone better
Damn, yeah

[Chorus: Jill Scott (Sampled) & 360]
I've got someone better at home
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah {Laughs} Hey, hey
It's the breaks, I got someone better at home
Get over it, get over it, alright

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, it's times like this when I really need to choose a song
To get me by when it's time for me to move along (What?)
She's bored, now she's doing nothing for me
"We were just helping each other out when we were horny"
Now have a look at what I've gone and done did
This time I'm the one who falls for dumb shit (So stupid)
We wanted sex though with no strings attached
And I said I love you, wish I could go bring it back but (I can't)
I couldn't help it, the shit was so wonderful
Never thought that it would be me to be the one to fall (Uh)
I think you're cool and I love it that you're mad fine
To fall in love though, I think I picked a bad time (Yep)
I love every minute landing together
The sex is so good I thought I'd found my forever (Nup)
Relationships, I was done for whatever
And then she went and told me that she found someone better

[Chorus: Jill Scott (Sampled) & 360]
Told me that I (Damn, fucking hell)
I got something better at home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Feel so stupid
How could I let that happen, you know?
I got something better at home
Like, I thought I was on top of my shit, but I obviously wasn't
Alright, here we go again

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo, it's times like this when you really need to choose a song
To warn everybody not to get too involved (Yep)
If you help each other out when you're horny
As soon as that begins, that's the end of the story (Written off)
There's no such thing as "no strings attached" (Nah)
'Cause with no strings you're gonna see the whole thing collapse
(Fall flat) And you're thinking they were down for whatever
Be warned 'cause they probably gone and found someone better

[Chorus]
Okay, all right (Yeah, yeah, goddamn)
'Cause I know (Damn, uh)
'Cause I know, know, know
I know (You know it, you love her, wow)
I got something better at home
(Yeah, dude, I really like Jilly, Jill Scott)
I know (Jilly)
(Jilly from Philly) I got something better at home
(I don't even have to say that, you know I would)
{Ad-Libs} (Uh, I love that curvy shit)
(Yeah {Laughs})
All right, all right, all right (Jilly) Let's calm down
[?] (That's a pretty sick voice though, ayy?)
(Good stuff, Jilly Scott)

[Outro: 360]
I wake up in the morning and yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
I wake up in the morning, yeah
