[Chorus: PEZ]
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here
You think performing would be fine right
Scares the shit out of me
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: PEZ]
'Kay, check it out

[Verse 1: PEZ]
The hands of time tick away
As I sit there waiting to go
Standing by, anticipatin'
'Cause it's the day of a show
Yeah, and there's that buzz in the air
But amidst the excitement, inside I'm
Tryna control my stress
And I sit backstage and hold my breath
Up in my mind, up in my mind
I think I'm already heading home
And I've been tryin', and I've been tryin'
But I just can't seem to let it go
Yeah, I'm so nervous right now
Heart racing as they turn the lights down
It's like I feel insane
Because I can hear my name, and

[Chorus: PEZ]
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here
I wish I could (that's right)
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: PEZ]
Okay, yeah

[Verse 2: PEZ]
But you know that it's just a phase
And so that notion begins to fade
An' drift away the
Moment I hit the stage and hear
As a roar erupts from the crowd
And I just fall in love with that sound
Now I'm gone, up in the clouds
And I'm not sure when I'm coming back down
Then all my
Fears disappear
This stage is all mine
It's like I'm in a dream
And when their energy's up
I swear it is such an adrenaline rush (yeah)
This buzz is better than anything
That I could get from a drug

[Chorus: PEZ]
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here
I wish I could (uh-huh)
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here (yeah)

[Bridge: PEZ]
Can somebody hear me?
Can somebody hear me?
Can somebody here me now?
Oh—oh—oh—oh
Can somebody hear me?
Can somebody hear me?
Can somebody here me now?
Oh—oh—oh—oh

[Pre-Chorus Ad-Libs: PEZ]
Yeah, uh, uh

[Chorus (Extended): PEZ]
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here
I wish I could (that's right)
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here (yeah)
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here (uh-huh)
I wish I could (whoo)
I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay right here
