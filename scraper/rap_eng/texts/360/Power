[Intro: Illy]
Yeah, Illy Illy, uncle 6 Dog
Stand the fuck up, cunts
Yeah

[Verse 1: Illy]
And I hear motherfuckers dissing me, tryna bait me or battle me
Berate me to rattle me, it's pitiful
Already gave a few K to charity, so I ain't giving any leg ups
To any fuckheads calling me faggot switch up your strategy
Like "Shoosh cunt", it's hard to keep it passive every day
When you're incessantly attacked for every action that you take
Every statement, every track, though I brag you can't escape
The fact, my arrogance is purely my reaction to the hate
'Cause I would never step on people's toes
For real, I think it's honestly 'cause nobody expected me to blow up, but
In thirty months I've gone from practically unknown
To practically the biggest fucking name without a plaque to show
But some don't matter what I give it, I could wrap it up and gift it
They'd skip it and say whoever on the track with me ripped it
Same way they say my album missed and actually think
Someone who's only heard hit singles has a valid opinion, nah
I hate feeling like I need to justify this, like
Because I'm doing must be writing just so fuckers buy it
What a cop out, haters brush aside my sacrifices
Tall poppies in a sea of ply punching pirates
Came up in the scene, paved my route
From seventeen I been giggin', thought I paid my dues
Only took a few rave reviews, a Triple J play or two
For all the knives to aim at guess who, fuck am I to do?
I don't beg no one for help for shit that I can fix
And I don't blame nobody else for sitches that I find I'm in
Ain't never withheld admiration for the pioneers or kings
So why the fuck would I begin to, I just do my thing
All haters got for their venom is jealous talks
Fuck a twenty for their disc, ain't got a penny for their thoughts
When I'm questioned with hate my only answer is love
Forward slash Illyal, tell 'em Stand The Fuck Up, right

[Verse 2: 360]
Ayo, my plan is unstuck
And when they question who the best is, yo, the answer comes up
With 360, check the madness uncut
Yo, I said Please Be Seated but Stand The Fuck Up, yeah
I was smart to give a taste in what I'm gonna do
So sit and watch and see lotta dudes follow suit
I understand if it's not for you, true
But I wrote it for myself and it's exactly what I wanted to
I got a name from the battle scene, battle scene
I got featured in some magazines, magazines
Just another kid who had a dream, but see
I'm knowin' where I came from, I'ma never stop battling
Shut the fuck up haters
Yo, I can't battle someone nameless just to make another dumb cunt famous
I'm living in the twilight zone
Where we treatin' every battle like it's fight night though
And I'm winnin', I will never let the limelight go
But yo, I seen a lot of styles, gotta find my own
But conform to what you want, I'd rather slice my throat
And when it comes to business, I mind my own
See it's not quite underground, not quite pop
And it's not quite indie and it's not quite rock, no
I never listen, doin' [?]
Keeping everybody happy, yo it's not my job, no
So you can have fans that like it
Then they turn their back on you the second that the masses find it
But not knowing that you made a lotta sacrifices
But when the haters get you down, let 'em go, you don't have to fight it
Uh, I'm a believer in good music
If I like the beat, fuck the politics, I should use it
Yeah, them times were raw
But it's two-thousand-eleven and these motherfuckers rappin' like it's ninety-four
You can never go dispute my fuckin' passion for it
I enjoy making songs that have a catchy chorus
Never lackin' in my raps at all, plus
I am always energetic, never see me give a flat performance

[Outro: 360]
That's power, bitch!
