[Verse 1]
Ay yo I hardly read the shit up on my Facebook wall-posts
Cause some kids are gonna hate me although
I read one from a kid who was in his teens
How he hated life and he didn't have shit to be
He couldn't take it, he hated this place
And he was gonna kill himself but didn't because of me
Yeah, I ain't a saint and I ain't perfect
But posts like that make the hate worth it
People say the fame hurts of change
All I've done is grown up, your still looking at the same person
If my views can re-arrange your beliefs, oh
If my songs can be saving a teen, yeah
If my words go and change how you think
Then I'ma make 'em believe in chasing in dreams
You see that rock I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

[Hook]
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

[Verse 2]
Making music is nothing like working a job
People think I ain't deserving this spot
Being real yo, I know that I deserve it because
I worked my arse off so I feel I've earned what I've got
See me battle different rappers, always serve 'em a lot
Try to clown, bring 'em down taking personal shots
Then a certain response
Made me understand when I said faggot really how hurtful it was
I didn't mean to offend at all
But those stabs I won't have in my vocab anymore
I ain't standing here defending myself, just to gain new fans, I'm trying to better myself
I'm trying to better the world, I rap to get my point across
I used to be the dude you'd avoid a lot
Now I'm making a living out of my voice
Staring out at the stars and the moon and playing join the dots

[Hook]
Keep my head above the ground I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
We can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

[Verse 3]
Ay yo I never just thought that I'd be anything more
Than a shitty rapper filling out a Centrelink form
On a level I thought I could never be on
Addicted to natural highs like when I perform
Got out the hole that they buried me in
Got sober, more grateful now than anyone is
I wouldn't change any of this, if I can have whatever I wish
Cause I'm stronger now than I ever have been
I don't wanna preach, but the message is this
The past happened, if it sucks then accept that it did
The past is all mental, in your head it exists
So live in the present and then it won't effect you a bit
Channel all my energy to capture the moon
Had it keep revolving and naturally grew
See that rock in the sky I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

[Hook]

And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
