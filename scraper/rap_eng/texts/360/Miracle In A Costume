[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, listen, before music was a piece of my life
I used to play basketball, that was me every night
I wanted to play college to, yo I'd reach for the sky
Until, at eighteen, I caught some disease in my eye, yeah
I had to stop playing, what should I do?
When ball was the only thing I wanted to do
Listen, that forced me to focus on music
Pez sat me down like "bro we can do this"
After hearing that I didn't need more really
Going half blind made me see more clearly
Yo, I've learnt to take the good with the bad
I'm half blind yeah but now have a look where I'm at
When something seems to turn negative in life
You can always go and turn it into anything you like
So if it happens just remember every time
Yo, a tragedy can always be a blessing in disguise

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, uh
When I was young I was attracted to the dark side
I wanted everyone to see me as the hard guy
Walking around with my mates trying to start fights
Hoping they wouldn't want to cause I can't fight
Thinking back now that shit could of ended crazy
I'm just glad that situation never faced me
Back then I was thinking you could never change me
What a dickhead, that's not how my parents raised me
See I wasn't facing the facts
Acting crazy, wishing I could take it all back but
It took one of my mates to get stabbed just to realize
This shit wasn't a game, it was wack
That's how I wrote "So Fake" so easily
'Cause, apart of those dudes, I could see in me
So, if somebody is wanting to fight
Just swallow your pride and leave it be and that's real

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

[Verse 3: 360]
Yeah, yeah, uh, I nearly died in an accident
Yeah, and so I wrote this story
It's funny though how the worst thing to happen
Probably was the best thing for me
Falling and Flying shouldn't take this long
But thanks to the crash, yo I made this song
So now I ain't afraid to see the day that I die
Because, with this, I'll be staying alive (I'll be staying alive)
Yeah, I believe in believing the sky's the limit
Have a look and you'll see me up there, flying in it
It's a nice view, sometimes you might lose
But understand when you fall you can fly too
Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do
Don't let them enter in your head because they aren't you
And understand you could have anything you want
If you put the effort in to remember what you've got

[Hook: Gossling]
When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume
