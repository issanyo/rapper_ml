[Verse 1: 360]
All these jealous motherfuckers are old now
Saying don't rap and go back to my old sound
(Buy my old shit mate) And people saying I've sold out
Yeah man, I have when I'm performing to a whole town
Yo, it ain't true, you work a nine to five
That you fucking hate for the money, what does that make you?
The difference is that I'm in love with this shit
And I'm doing me, fuck what you think (Damn 60!)
Hey yo, I aim high, never low, they try getting close
If they ain't getting with what I say, I let 'em go
Wait, hide, then explode you see me take flight
An insane height, you want it? Then come and get a dose
I hear 'em talk but honestly all that realness bores me
I went my own path, I knew I'd kill it surely
Those who used to hold the crown in this field before me
They're the same motherfuckers who now kneel before me

[Hook: 360]
Here's a toast to living in the life I chose
Heaven knows it's the one that chose me
Nothing comes free when you're hungry
Staring down two roads trying to get the money
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream

[Verse 2: 360]
My brain's kind of fried, gimme a sec
It's been about five weeks since I been in my bed
I work, I can't recall the last minute I slept
I ain't running from 5-0 but I'm resisting arrest
I can't sleep until I'm the best
I will when I'm dead, I took that in a literal sense
And while the rest of you just sit on the fence
I'm starting point guard, go and give a kiss to the bench
Hey yo, in hip hop, you get props
The second that you let 'em see your shit's pop, they're pissed off
"Keep it real" and piss off
Thought of every goal I wanted
Wrote a list of all my biggest dreams now every one of 'em's ticked off
Hey yo, I can't look at life on the bright side
The only hours I leave home is at night time
I'm an emcee, no care, stress free
Needed no one to accept me, except me

[Hook: 360]
Here's a toast to living in the life I chose
Heaven knows it's the one that chose me
Nothing comes free when you're hungry
Staring down two roads, trying to get the money
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream
Here's a toast to living in the life I dream

[Outro: Sam Bruno]
Carry on, carry on in your world
Cause I'm on, cause I'm on to my dreams
Carry on, carry on in your world
Cause I'm under my dream
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers
Here's to my dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Here's to my dreams
Carry on, carry on in your world
Cause I'm under my dream
And I'm never gonna wake up
From my dream
