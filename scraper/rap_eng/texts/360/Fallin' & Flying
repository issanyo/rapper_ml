[Verse 1: GMC]
Yo
They used to say, "If you aim for the win, you hit the top of the tree"
If you aim for the top of the tree, you never leave the ground
So my path is much more than just me and now
I gotta risk falling if I ever wanna reach the clouds
Sometimes branches don't feel steady
Sometimes your man just don't feel ready
I can feel edgy but still jump in the
Unknown and not ask for answers, I don't need any
I don't know how it's supposed to be done
Livin' my life between both the rose and a gun
Destiny hints to me that it's chosen the one
That's why I fly till I float too close to the sun
And if I fall and come back down from the high
I'll turn around 'cause I can't back down from the sky
'Cause I remain faithful, even when I'm dying
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying

[Chorus: GMC]
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, yo, people ask what I wish for
Man, I wish that everybody on this Earth would just wish more
We could wish for some better things
But I'm grateful to even be grateful for anything
And that don't mean I don't walk on the edge
'Cause I'll be doing anything I want till I'm dead
I do what needs to be done to feel contentment
In a hope that I live a life with no regretment
Hungry ain't even a word to describe me
I'm starving, that's the proper term that defines me
Even at the highest of highs, I'm still climbing
Swimmin' in the clouds with the stars, where you'll find me
Remain faithful, even when we're dying
'Cause even when we're falling we're flying
We must remain faithful, even when we're dying
'Cause even when we're falling we're flying

[Chorus (Extended): GMC]
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
And I feel
Like I'm falling
'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying
