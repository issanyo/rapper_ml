[Intro: 360 & PEZ]
Yo, yo (Yes)
It's full throttle, I pull bottles
Smack your head in until you fools hobble
Yeah, with the H2GO, you're way too slow
With your gay new flow
Fuck youse, I love to win
Smash your head in with a rubbish bin
Check that ill shit, I kill shit
Here we go

[Verse 1: PEZ]
I'm a self-confessed psychopath, might attack
Any cats writin' raps till, inside, their eyes are black
Despise crowds, find out we'll fight loud
Right now, not hittin' switches but I'll put your lights out
The type of kid to beat you to death with a pencil case
And use your blood to see what picture the stencil makes
Kickin' back, spittin' raps, rip the tracks
So of course I'll split your back with a fuckin' cricket bat
I'll fake my death till doctors check the carcass
Escape during the autopsy just to run starkers
Through your block of apartments, full cravin' a chick
Both arms missin' but still wavin' my dick
I rap bars exactly tracks scarred
Sneak in your backyard, slap your mum's fat arse
For hanging clothes on the line, keep my flows in time
Fuck all of your thoughts, 'cause I'm imposing mine
Let's get this paper, dog, "A4 or A3?"
Don't give a fuck what it is just as long as you pay me
Nah, I'm just jokin', not into flowin' with chains
All the bling shit's the reason why I'm goin' insane
It's expected, grab the mic and I wreck shit
Turn the tables on my life so my nickname's Techniques
Outkast won the Grammy but I wanna beat the boss
Big fights with stereos till I see the speaker box
And smash this shit till I leave it in the gutter
Yo, I'll crack your skull in with a jar of peanut butter
Or Vegemite, let us fight and I bet you might
Step aside 'cause every time I just wreck the mic

[Pre-Chorus: 360 & PEZ]
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da

[Chorus 1: 360 & PEZ]
I'm a fucking nutcase
I am, I am
Just a fucking nutcase
I'll cut off your nose (yes)

[Interlude: 360 & PEZ]
PEZ is talkin' about wavin' his dick
We'll get your grandma and wear duct tape on her lips
To make her my bitch
Yo, fuckin' breakin' her ribs and makin' her twitch
And I'll stick her in a grave in a ditch (yes)
We're fuckin' grazin' her skin and fuckin' shavin' her chin
Where's your daughter? I'm breakin' her in
Stick her fuckin' face in a bin (yeah)
Let the motherfuckin' rapin' begin
We're makin' her sing (ooh)
We're fuckin' namin' her Glinn (yes, yeah)
(Yes, fuckers) Figure it out
While lickin' her out, I'll stick my dick in her mouth
And she'll get fuckin' shived on her couch
We want a drunk chick, Kylie Minogue type with one tit
Tight pussy to make me cum quick
Yo, dumb bitch (ah shit)

[Verse 2: 360]
We like to carve women, fat chicks with lard in 'em
And make 'em anorexic and jam my shaft in 'em
My last victim copped an arse kicking
Your heart sinkin', plus my fart stinkin' like Bart Simpson
Since my last chick, I've been in a foul mood
Only happiness, I get [?] when my bowel moves
We shout crude words [?], check mate
You'll get raped like a cripple in a neck brace
I think I need a piss, so open your gob
You might as well stay down, I feel like a bog
You better stop, I've got the sore behind ya
With quick fingers, if you talk, I'll blind ya
My cock's known when it mauls vaginas
They compare it to the Great Wall of China
A psycho, and if you hate it, tempt me
I'll confess to the kidnappin' of Jaidyn Leskie
And he's sayin' "Please grab a blade and neck me"
'Cause he's sick of bein' the ice in my favourite Esky
I'm a crazy MC, if you make a threat, g
Then I'll raise my leg and break your neck and make your chest bleed
Don't hate, I'm friendly, the school dropout
I just followed the crowd, it seemed like a cool cop-out
I'd rather be fuckin' a slut groupie
Muff bruising, my boys watch me fuckin' her plump booty
Fuckin' her up, fuming, check it
And after I'm done rooting I'll cum in her mum crudely
So fuck uni, it's all right as a hobby
But you'll see me in a trench coat, hackin' her body
Your bitch might play 6, so kids might hate this
They'll have fucked thoughts of a midnight rapist
Me and PEZ are known when we fistfight gay kids
If you say a word, watch us flip like Matrix

[Chorus 2: 360 & PEZ]
I'm a fucking nutcase
I'll stab you to death
I'm inside your wardrobe
I'll chew off your legs
