[Verse 1:]
Jump on my cloud, we can float to the sky
We can go to my home if you like
We can go to where nobody flies
All it takes is to open your mind
We be heading up crazy high
So come if you ain't afraid of heights
Come aboard and we'll chase the sky
But know you will literally change your mind
It's all good, we can take our time
Where we're going yo there ain't no time
I want you all to meet a mate of mine
And if you see reality then wave good-bye
You would never think to go here
Yo, you're going to have a grin from both ears
When you finally find this place you can hide away while we live with no fear

[Hook:]
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 2:]
Here, take a little bit of this and
Wash it down with a little bit of drinking
Watch it now any second it will hit
But don't over do it in a minute it'll kick in
Looking down from a bird's eye view
See me running from a world like you
Yeah it might be your first time
But with me you don't need a return flight, true
This is what the galaxy's for
We'll come down when gravity calls
I understand that there has to be more
You ain't seen this planet before
All it take is to ride the right cloud
You just gotta look inside to find out
If you wanna have the time of your life then
Stop thinking the time is right now

[Hook:]
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

[Bridge:]
Do you want me
We're a thousand mile away from anyone
Do you want me
If you want then run
You want then run

[Hook:]
Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
