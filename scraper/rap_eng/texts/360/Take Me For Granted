[Chorus: Oso]
Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home
I tried so many times
So many ways
Don't throw it all away by
Sayin' you love me
You didn't mean it
You just got my heart and left me cold (Uh)

[Verse: 360]
These scattered memories, a list of broken photographs
All the things I wanna know, if I could only ask
It seems always accustomed to have a broken heart
But honestly we both should start admitting that we've grown apart
And in the past years, I've only grown to hating love
'Cause all the beauty is ruled out by the pain in love
And don't get angry when I say that I'm afraid to love
Because you took too much advantage when I gave you trust
And now I try to see it normally and clear in my eyes
But now I can't 'cause of fears and the lies
I try to make it work, but know that really it's died
Every day I'm sitting praying I can feel it alive
For just a split second to taste the feeling of life
'Cause every time it gets remotely close, I feel it's a lie
I try letting down the shield in hope of healing my eyes
Now I'm barred of all emotion, now I'm merely alive
But why?

[Chorus: Oso]
Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home
I tried so many times
So many ways
Don't throw it all away by
Sayin' you love me
You didn't mean it
You just got my heart and left me cold
