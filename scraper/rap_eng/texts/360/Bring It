Ground up!

[Verse]
Yo
I'm disliked 'cause I’m clean cut, I don’t even seem rough (nup)
All this hate fuckin' shits me like this scene does
I'm as real as you, rappin' is my life
But I smile in my pictures 'cause I'm happy I’m alive (I am)
When rap started, it was meant to be the positive sound
These days, it's gone the opposite route
And I rap like a bully, you act like a pussy
So-called veterans but you rap like you're rookies
Fair enough, to drop an album, you will take your time
But you’ve been workin' on your album since like eighty-nine
I was gonna take years, yeah, maybe five
But that ain't takin' time, that’s a fuckin' waste of time (uh)
A whole album of your flows flippin' syllables
Quick to hate others when your own shit is pitiful (wack)
Why don't you try and be your own individual?
Everything you stand for is so hypocritical
You hate on us because of photo shoots
But when you pose to look hard, they're called photos too
And if you're poor, evil and rough, the scene'll love yours
But get commercial media love then you're done for
I'll pay you dudes respect when I actually feel your music
You want to know we smashing and rapping in here? The youth is
Call us pathetic, I'll tell you what pathetic is
This whole scene's topic range is always something negative
Yo, the girls like us, we dress with impressive taste (what?)
They hate you, you dress to impress your mates (true)
I went for it when I looked at the risk
I got balls, jumped up and dissed the Hoods at a gig
Now a bunch of dudes, when they see me, really want to break my jaw
But the hood status is exactly what I’m aiming for
And now these tough emcees want to see me fuckin' bleed
It wasn't a threat, that line was only tongue in cheek (fuck)
This scene is hard to find the energy for
This is heart on the sleeve rap, leave the rest at the door
And I lost a fan base just like never before
I've been shunned 'cause I ain’t workin' with Trem anymore
I was stoked to be down with the Lyrical Commission
That style wasn’t me though, I was innocently driven
And watch you run and say that '60 went and dissed them
That ain’t a diss, you dumb-arse, it's a difference of opinion
It takes a man to admit it, yo, it wasn't me
I love that raw style but honestly, it's not for me
It ain’t me, yeah, you can’t hate me
'Cause I love Lord Finesse but I'd rather listen to Jay-Z
So if someone hates me, they react physically
I wonder why? They can’t fuck with me lyrically
And you can hate me 'cause I’m singin' on tracks
But if you got a problem, then come and bring it on wax

[Outro]
I'll burn you, yeah
That was to anyone, I’m fuckin' over it
Someone
