[Intro]
Uh, yeah, yeah, well (No, don’t look at that girl)
My, my name is Bob (Yes, his, his name is Bob. My name is Tom)
(We are same person, just different name) Yeah, yeah
(That, that concrete has a good rivet, is that a good one?)
May-maybe try and touch that one (Okay, I’ll look at it)
Sometimes I smell like strawberries (Thomas here again)
Yeah, my hair’s not brown, (Not, not anymore) that’s okay (Look at me though)
Yes, so, jus’, my name is Bob

[Sample]
“I go places but I can’t get there. I see things that isn’t there. I do things that’s out of the ordinary for human beings. You’re crazy, you’re crazy.”

[Chorus]
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason (“You’re crazy, you’re crazy”)
This is part of my life that I live in now
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason
And this is part of my life that I live in now

[Post-Chorus]
And you know that I’m crazy, that I live in now
That I live in now
And you know that I’m crazy, that I live in now
This is part of my life that I live in now

[Verse]
The sky’s purple, I’m feelin’ my heart racin’
Talkin’ to invisible friends (Hello, hello. How are you doing today?)
But half the time, I don’t get a reply
So I end up havin’ sex with a fence (I had a splinter on that one)
And people say that I’m crazy
What would they know, what would they know?
I think it’s ‘cause I ate a mushroom
I found on the side of the road (Hi, my name is Bob)

[Chorus]
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason
This is part of my life that I live in now
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason
And this is part of my life that I live in now

[Bridge]
Please don’t say I’m crazy
Please don’t say I’m crazy
Please don’t say I’m crazy
Please don’t say I’m crazy
Please don’t say I’m crazy (No, no, no)
Please don’t say I’m crazy (No, no, no)
Please don’t say I’m crazy (No, no, no)
Coldplay – they think I’m crazy
For us, it’s a hard knock life (Crazy)
Please don’t say I’m crazy ([?] crazy)
Please don’t say I’m crazy ([?])
Please don’t say I’m crazy (It’s a hard knock life)
It’s a hard knock life
It’s a hard knock life
It’s a hard knock life
But you don’t notice when you’re crazy

[Chorus]
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason
This is part of my life that I live in now
I feel hungry inside, I stay breathin’
But can’t feed, no wonder I can’t see things
Always suddenly snap for no reason
And this is part of my life that I live in now

[Outro]
Stop callin’ me crazy, I’m not a fucking psycho {Wails}
