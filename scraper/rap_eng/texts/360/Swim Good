[Ad-Libs: 360]
Uh
Yo, yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
I'm being honest, yo, I think that I'm a good dude
But I have no idea lately what I should do
I just can't believe the test that I've been put
And I just got no choice but to be strong and push through
Had a simple plan, now this shit is different, damn
Unexpected negatives and everything has hit the fan
I wanna run, but I gotta be the bigger man
The shit that's going has me feeling like a little ant
And if you really understood then you would not blame me
And people seeing my success and see I'm complaining
I know my song's played every single day
But apart from all the music everything is going wrong lately
And if you don't know me well then you won't know
I've mastered the art of feeling that I don't show
And don't go and judge my life if you don't know
Half of it is high, but the other half is so low
And music's good, but unfortunately
I've seen a standup family get brought to their knees
Normally he'd [?] deal with it would talk to a beat
But lately that ain't an option and frankly that is a problem
You see I wanna write these words 'cause it helps
But I can never put it out 'cause it'll hurt someone else
Listen, so the pen is like my psychiatrist
And the music is the only set of wings that I am flying with
It's hard to describe exactly what I get from music
I'd be a fucking nervous wreck if I ever lose it
I've got problems and this shit is therapeutic
I start hitting rock bottom if I never use it
I love life, but honestly I'm stuck
See it's got me in a rut, I wanna run, but that's the worst way
And sometimes it makes you wanna turn to drugs
But the drugs are the reason that it's fucked in the first place

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Verse 2: Prime]
They got us fighting for control over somebody no one's ever heard of
Swearing on a bible that we don't believe a word of
Too cool for a mentor, there's no one we can learn off
This show's getting too real, I vote that we should turn off
But every channel's the same, reality's changed
You can't tell who's putting on an act for the game
I can't tell if I'm actually sane 'cause people tell me
I'm different when everyone else is exactly the same
Or how even though I'm attracted to fame and people tell me
"Shoot for the stars," all I do is practice my aim
So you can say what you want, you can say I'm deceitful
I can say in a song what you can't say to some people
You been keeping up appearances, I was coming on slow
60 tell me "Tryna get my game on pronto"
I was at the party, off my face on Cointreau
I was tryna party, get my rage on: Rondo
Career had a tag without a name on: John Doe
If they identified it as dead they were wrong though
It ain't a crime, I wanna live clean
Doing what I done best since I was sixteen
I got a small opportunity, a big dream
Tryna see both points of view like a split screen
My ears pinned back, ready for the future
Till I get my cape on and everything is super

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Bridge (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
No flares (Broke my heart)
No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

[Chorus (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Outro (Sampled): Frank Ocean]
Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no, oh no no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no, oh no no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
