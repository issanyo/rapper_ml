[Verse 1: 360]

Uh
If I'm looking at you in the eyes then you better run
Never talk shit, if I want it I just get it done
Anybody sending me a threat yo they never come
You'll be knocking at the front door with an intercom
You could have your whole city there I'm like "bring it on"
I feel the change in the atmosphere
I'm amazed at the way that you act so scared
I'm afraid that I have no fear
I'm the one to watch
You gotta know right now I'm a underdog
On my way back up, yo I love the top
To reclaim that crown that I fucking lost
Imma kill em' all
If they hit me in the face I'm like give me more
If they want it in the street then we gonna brawl
Everybody want a piece, I'm like "give me war"
I'm messing you up
Hit you so hard that you'll never get up
Can you feel the adrenaline rush?
Better than any energy you ever will get from a drug

[Hook: 360]
Understand me it's (lights out)
Disrespect me it's (lights out)
If you want to go toe to toe we'll go blow for blow 'till it's lights out
Underrate me it's (lights out)
If you underestimate me it's (lights out)
Yeah, we'll go head to head so protect your neck or it's lights out

[Verse 2: S-A-M]
Sun on that come down
Sitting view while I come up
Don't want beef from them punchlines
You can get it like Ronda
Difference 'tween me and you
Nigga
Phones up while my phones off me
Me and '60'll leave you 6 deep, and we still yelling out one love
Take it on this bump off
I'm straight ill like I'm on drugs
Got a lot of people that do not believe in me
Cause they ain't mean shit where I come from
Walking 'round with my chest up
Block my dreams, better vest up but it
Don't matter, still gets splattered
Bitch I'm aiming for the neck up
The headshot
You fucking with a nigga then you're really gonna get it
On every beat I be killing it
I never see a limit I don't know where the finish is
In every race I be running motherfucker I be winning it
And I swear it's been a minute since I seen another kid writing records on the Guinness
If you wanna know the name of the next kid
Check back, insane, have a guess, bitch

[Hook: 360]
Understand me it's (lights out)
Disrespect me it's (lights out)
If you want to go toe to toe we'll go blow for blow 'till it's lights out
Underrate me it's (lights out)
If you underestimate me it's (lights out)
Yeah, we'll go head to head so protect your neck or it's lights out
