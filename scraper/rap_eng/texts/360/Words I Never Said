[Chorus: Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 1: Justice]
Yeah
This is more than music, it's a way of life
You can call it stupid, you can hate it, right?
This is not some torture, this is self-inflection
It's what happens when you scream and no one else is listening
This is ugly, this is tasteless, this is imperfection
It's adultery, this is hatred, this is indiscretion
This ain't David Blaine, this isn't misdirection
The music is the drug, the lyrics are the intervention
This is placebo effect, man, this is Panadol
It's free falling, no, shoot down that rabbit hole
It's the equivalent of TEC's guns, lock and load
It's the epitome of sex, drugs, rock and roll
It's your deepest fear, unbearable to think of
It's what I see when I'm staring at a ink blot
This is my brain, my eyes, this is my spinal chord
This is my state of mind, this is my life support
This is the truth underneath all the lies, but they know
That they fall deeper and deeper the higher they go
And even though you're on the edge an' you're tryna say no
You end up right back here, so might as well just let go

[Chorus: Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, with this I can reach a higher state
But without it, I'm fucked up and wide awake
I can't handle thinking anyone's above it
Can't even live until everybody loves it
And now I've gone and found the rules that I live and die with
Found myself tryna fight those who criticise it
Try to prove what it meant when they'd simplify it
To realise that I'm the one I'm in the fight with
Because I don't need this
But if I'm happy with myself, then they won't mean shit
I drop names so I might see some repercussions
I'm being honest though, so if they get offended; fuck 'em
I'm not a fighter; I'm a lover, mate
But if you are standing in my way then I'ma bite you in ya fucking face
Wait, 'cause that ain't even a threat at all
I'm just never stopping in this shit that I was destined for

[Chorus (Extended): Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
Never said
I can't back the words I never said

[Verse 3: GMC]
A gift can be curse, a talent can be a burden
Could mine be one of those talents that's never hearda'?
Just another echo in a hallway full of has-beens?
Just another rapper who will always be the last in
Line? You get my piece hungry, like my last meal
But forget my priest, look
I ain't dying, I'm fighting to live
The only real fight that I gotta win is the fight in my head
And such is life, Cay-sa-ra-sa-rah mafucker
I'm on my grind mafucker, and such is life
For us generation F.L.Y
So stay tuned, the revolution gon' be televised
In the comfort of ya living room, watching us falling
Fly and find out what a mafucking milli' do
Yeah, so we'll see you when we touch down
Matter fact, fuck that, we ain't gonna come down

[Chorus: Skylar Grey (Sampled)]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
