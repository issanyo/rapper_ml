[Chorus: Hein Cooper]
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I
Won't be by your side
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
When I realised
This is my goodbye

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, have you ever been dogged
By a best mate or even by a friend that you got?
Well, you been gettin' 'em wrong
They put a knife in your back to get ahead in their job
You been definitely gettin' 'em wrong
All this hatred, where the hell have they been gettin' it from?
Every time you succeed like you're settin' 'em off
It's like your life is somethin' that they're envious of
Don't get jelly when they win though
Anytime they're killin', go and cheer for 'em
Don't be happy when they get low
Hit 'em up and let 'em know you're here for 'em
Throwin' hands what you're gettin' ready for
Never been a friendship where there's never any flaws
In the rulebook there's forever been a clause:
'Never bring a life down just to get ahead in yours'
Yo, tell 'em

[Chorus: Hein Cooper]
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I
Won't be by your side
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you (said my prayer for you)
When I realised
This is my goodbye

[Post-Chorus 1: Hein Cooper]
I feel that I
Realised
My goodbye
Is goodbye

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah, I know it hurts to get backstabbed
Your first reaction, you wanna go and stab back
It doesn't work, there's nothin' worse
It's undeserved, now they're spreadin' lies and it fuckin' hurts
They prob'ly did it out of vanity
What's killin', they were meant to be your family
The shit'll burn, but give 'em worse
Live and learn, swallow your pride and be the bigger person
That's the problem with friendly competition
Only gonna end as opposition
You don't ever wanna get in that position
Tell 'em but they never gonna listen
Yeah, if you do that's some shit that you'll regret it
Either isn't gonna end well or isn't gonna end
Forgive 'em, start wishin' 'em the best
'Cause while they prayin' that you fail, go and hit 'em with success
And kill 'em

[Bridge: Hein Cooper]
You gotta know, you gotta know
How you've betrayed me
And you oughta know, you oughta know
I hope you make it
Until you grow, until you grow
Out of this hatred
You'll never know, you'll never know
Until you change it

[Chorus: Hein Cooper]
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I (feel that I)
Won't be by your side (by your side)
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you (said my prayer for you)
When I realised
This is my goodbye

[Post-Chorus 2: Hein Cooper]
I feel that I
Realise
My goodbyes
My goodbye
I feel that I
Realise
My goodbye
Is goodbye
