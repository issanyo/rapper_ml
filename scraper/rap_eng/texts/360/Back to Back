[Verse 1: 360]
My life, my life is like the craziest fantasy
So I got the urge to be escapin' reality
I write my best shit when I'm sayin' what's bad for me
So in my subconscious I'm praying for tragedy
On that real rap shit, yeah, I'm back on it
Some are thinking that I went and turned my back on it
I just hear a dope beat and then I rap on it
But what's being real to me is if I rap honest
Watched The Secret, got up on my goal shit
Last night stayin' up ticking off the whole list
If you honestly what you're wantin' to achieve
You will probably receive it gift wrapped
Uh, I started followin' my dreams
And I got a little cream when I saw I had a gift: rap
Grateful, can't believe I did that
And now I'm gatherin' everythin' I can give back

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

[Verse 2: 360]
Now I gotta keep it goin': no endin'
And keep the ball rollin': momentum
They wanna bring us down but we won't let them
Fail is a little word that we don't mention
I feel like it's still not true
Put me next to BnE and them Hilltop dudes
But everythin' is me and I guess I'm bein' me
Now I found a winnin' syrup and I will not lose, no
Takin' aim while I scope the crown
It's only gettin' closer and I'm focused now
Got told by the suits I should tone it down
They can go and get fucked, they don't own me now
I hope this doesn't sound negative as hell
But we did on our own without anybody's help
Fuck censoring myself, 'cause me being me
Is a essence of my sales and a credit to myself

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

[Interlude: 360]
{Chuckles} About six years ago I was an apprentice chippy, and, uh,  PEZ told me to quit and focus on rap, and my boss told me that I wouldn't be shit. Look at me now, dickhead

[Verse 3: 360]
Uh, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Uh, I'd rather be fit and wired
Yeah, I'd rather be givin' time
To makin' an impact and leavin' these kids inspired
Now I'm someone they can look up to
If you're down, brother, know that you can look up too
If they gettin' in your way you can push on through
And if they tell you that you can't tell 'em, "Good, fuck you"
Never thought as an innocent teen
That this'd be me, the shit that I breathe, but I love it now
Understand there's a difference between us
Livin' the dream and livin' in dreams, I am above the clouds

[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]
Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away
