[Hook]
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
While we're on that subject
I'm pissin' off the fuck-heads and puttin' 'em in such stress
Cause everything I want in life I haven't even done yet
I set 'em off, line 'em up then I get across
Anything that you hate about me is everything that you're jealous of
Like tennis courts, and centre-folds
Everything that you never got, I just went ahead and bought
King, I'm the motherfuckin' ruler God
Obey Six: motherfucking rule of God
My suit is on, come and check for that new Vuitton
Every day up at Vue De Monde, that's they type of food I'm on

[Hook]
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck-head the finger
Who's upset that I bunk bedded their sister
Some said that they're bitter, then come check me and get up
They talk about me then walk around me, they can't step to the winner
I'm ahead of my time, bet I'll be crossing the enemy's line
They forfeit, they try to rhyme but they force it
I'm awesome, they awkward
Talking about me in forums but when they see me it's all good
If haters wanna talk about me ya'll should
Promote my name whether love or hate, it's all good
Whatever you say it doesn't affect me, ya gettin' me payed
Just remember the name, at the end of the day

[Hook]
I don't care what you say
If you're not behind me, stay the fuck out my way
I'm livin', no speed limits
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
(You know, I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less)
(I used to give a fuck)
