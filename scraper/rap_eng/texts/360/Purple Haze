[Intro:]
Yeah
Eso and 60
Bout to browneye the world

[Verse 1: Eso]
Yo
Eso and 60
Yo you're fucking with wizards
So imagine my imagination running with scissors
In the kitchen, bitches
Cooking something explicit
Burning buddha man I'm cooler then a cunt in a blizzard
When I hold the mic I alter time
I'm cold as ice like Walter White
I rhyme like a typhoon
I shine like there's five moons
So ease back, relax and let the words fly
Off the paper major lazer's at my third eye
I can't control it, it's too hard to handle or hold it
It's real and still hungry
I feel like Filth Dunphy
See basically I got a head full of images
That can mind fuck the world with just this pen in my fingertips
And the oracle will only mess with your mind
I know the geo, Neo is just second in line
See this is what it looks like when you master your craft
And you can make the big bang look like a fart in the bath

[Hook:]
My recipe is Jack Daniels, non-filtered Camels
Crates full of samples, dutches and examples
One Nike in the grave, one Nike in the rave
It all makes sense after the ‘shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, yeah
A lot of rappers think they're actually dope
Move a few units then imagine the throne
It has to be known
It's true they get views on youtube
But I kill them in the number game that matters the most
I was so broke I used to make the girls laugh
Now I got a mansion with a first class bird bath
Wanted to go worldwide but they can't understand my damn accent
Like Brad Pitt in that snatch flick
Imagine the success that I aim to get
When in my eyes I still haven't made it yet
If we find a planet that's as crazy as us
We probably have a massive bender takin' alien drugs
That's the only time I'd put a needle straight in my blood
No pun intended but I reckon I'll be spacey as fuck
Take em back to earth get em wasted with us
And see if they can last a bender with Australian cunts

[Hook:]
My recipe is Jack Daniels
Non-filtered Camels
Crates full of samples
Dutches and examples
One Nike in the grave
One Nike in the rave
It all makes sense after the ‘shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze

[Outro: Eso & 360]
Hey yo six
I feel like I'm swingin' off fucking King Kong's balls
With a parachute open and a firecracker out my ass mate
Right now I feel like the most majestic centaur that has ever graced the planet
And jizz the colour of black and yellow so it looks like I'm shooting out bees cunt
I feel like a forty foot magician
Dressed in lions fur
Playing beethoven on a piano
With my motherfuckin' dick
If a unicorn had a platinum horn
That's what I would be motherfucker
With two dangling testicles running down
With veins the size of fucking trampolines mate
Nobody understands mate
I feel like I've got the power of a thousand angels penises
And my rainbow technicoloured coat is resistant to any of your ammunition
Oh fuck
Oh fuck mate
