[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
Yo, what’s attracting people to the life of fame?
The nights away binging, getting blind for days
Would you expect a tidal wave of guys
All disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made?
When you’re famous, you’re the person people like to hate
Are you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say?
Yo, looking back at life, I’d never thought I’d go this far
Yo, I’m just thankful people welcomed me with open arms
All these new friends and people that I hope to trust
Try to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are?
Girl, if the light's on, on your iPod
And it’s my songs then drive on 'cause a fan is not what I want

[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of-
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?
What’s the price of fame?
What’s the price of fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
What’s the price of fame?

[Verse 2: 360]
Yeah
Imagine it, never thought I’d be havin’ it
Keep belief and be confident
But stay away from that arrogance
Yeah, I’m cashing in
That ain’t what’ll bring happiness
And I’m lucky, making a living off of this music
That’s what my passion is
And I could go and buy a crazy, fresh Mercedes-Benz
But I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent
Yo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8am
After I’ve been placing bets and partying for days on end
Look what’ll happen if I never see the same success
Yo, in the schemes of things, I think there’s better ways to spend
When I was young, I saw my grandpa get laid to rest
And what I’ve got, I’d trade it in
If I could see his face again

[Hook: Gossling]
Fame, cars, lights stay on you

I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of-
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?
What’s the price of fame?
What’s the price of fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
What’s the price of-
Fame, cars, lights stay on you
Cameras flashing for you
I’d trade it all on the way
To happiness. What’s the price of fame?

[Outro: 360 & Gossling]
Ain’t about all the money made
What’s the price of fame?
Think about what you wanna pay
Ain’t about all the money made
Think about what you wanna pay
