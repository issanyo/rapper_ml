Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Most people wanna say something but it takes 'em, a day, you see
I'll tell you 'bout somethin' taken away from me
See I've forgiven people makin' mistakes
But different places they were basically just changing their face
I can't imagine living life with no control
And blocking all feelings in your heart frozen cold
Living fake is something you can't undo
And you've lived it so long that it becomes you
For no reason all the hate made it so wrong
But you can only hold a brave face for so long
The brave face soon turns into an evil one
It's like the wind changed took away your peace and fun
Dig deep past the front and you'll start to yell
Shit I know, yo it's hard as hell to ask for help
But me, I'm coming with the welcoming mat
Even if you think I'm, weak I put myself in a track
See, if I have emotions then I'm coughin' em up
Over years and years, you dudes bottle em up
There's no wonder you don't hesitate to fight a dude
It's the only way you let out what's inside of you
You can call me weak for having an emotional track
But you're more of a pussy because you're holding it back,
You always talk about the bloodshed,
The only reason you don't cry is 'cause you don't want your boys to see you're upset
You're scared they'll laugh taunt and belt you
If they were your real friends they'd fucking help you
Then behind closed doors, you let your dough poor
And let it all out and cry till your throat's sore
See if I'm feeling down like what everyone fears
I'm not afraid to let it out if anyone hears
If I had the power, I'd change you to the old you
And take away all the people that control you
You're in denial and you're stuck in a binge
You don't think for yourself, you're just a puppet on strings
I know you're insecure motherfucker, just think
Why else would a song like this get under your skin?

[Hook]
You're so fake (yeah) you're so fake (uh)
You're so fake, why can't you be yourself? (why not?)
You're so fake (huh) you're so fake (listen)
You're so fake, you're never gonna be yourself

[Verse 2]
Honestly, fuck taking my time
Yo, I'm after the spotlight and I'm making it mine
And I had the haters claim that I was faking my rhymes
But I've left that shit behind, fuck saying goodbye
Because I love hip-hop but I hate the Australian type
A bunch of meatheads acting all crazy in fight
Yo, I'm brave enough to say what I say on the mic
On some real shit, I'm staying that way till I die
Optimistic and I place all the hate to the side
Hate these days, always patiently waiting inline
I know I shine but it's making me blind
There's heaps of beats to destroy and paper to find
You're all caught in an image ashamed when you cry
I'd rather cry then have my face imitate a disguise
It's like I'm always being faced with these lines
It ain't my life but you say that it's mine
I used to take it in stride, wish I talk with Australian pride
But I hate this country, I hate what you like
Superficial, highstrung, protencious and fake
The fucked thing is ninety percent will never relate

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, have a think about that one
If you think it's about you then it probably is
That one was meant to be taken to heart
Yeah, 360, Pabstrakt, what?
