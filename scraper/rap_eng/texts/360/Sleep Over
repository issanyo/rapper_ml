[Intro: Travy P]
[?]

[Chorus: Travy P]
I know that she good, she could get it right
She gon' show me if she bad, she could stay the night
Can I kick it like tribe, wouldn't that be nice
Come and bunk wit' me girl and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
Yeah, it's all good, we gon' get it right
Take a trip wit' me girl, I might change ya life

[Verse 1: Travy P]
When you coming over, I hit you on my line
She say she misses me like all the time
Wanna come kick it, her body so defined
I just wanna lick it, I love to see her smile
Yeah, you know I'm wit' it, girl, don't make me show you
Been out on my grind, now she grindin' on me
She can make it work, I ain't loosing grip
Head in the pillow, hands on your hips

[Pre-Chorus: Travy P]
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
Girl you gon' love it like this, she love to be hittin' the splits
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
But girl don't say I'm your only, 'cause I ain't one to get homely

[Chorus: Travy P]
I know that she good, she could get it right
She gon' show me if she bad, she could stay the night
Can I kick it like tribe, wouldn't that be nice
Come and bunk wit' me girl and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
Yeah, it's all good, we gon' get it right
Take a trip wit' me girl, I might change ya life

[Verse 2: 360]
See, I been broke and I been rich, go broke again? Never that
6 wasn't the best youngin, love meant nothin': Tennis match
Your father might be a sick cunt, guarantee I got a better dad
Only spend the cash if I can get it back, you know it's over: Checkered flag
Never happy, yo, I think I wanna mill', only givin' 'em that million dollar feel
I'm about to go to fuckin' work on 'em, hold a hammer up like, "This is not a drill"
Nothin' more than fuckin' sauce, aisle five, bruh, try and find us
Come aboard then cum aboard, mile high club, I'm a fly fuck
Get rich, and then get rich, and then get rich, and then throw it to me
Eatin' out while fuckin' with a small french chick: Bon app√©tit
Rappers'd die for this actual life
It's funny with everybody throwing shade all I'm catching is shine

[Pre-Chorus: Travy P]
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
Girl you gon' love it like this, she love to be hittin' the splits
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
But girl don't say I'm your only, 'cause I ain't one to get homely

[Chorus: Travy P]
I know that she good, she could get it right
She gon' show me if she bad, she could stay the night
Can I kick it like tribe, wouldn't that be nice
Come and bunk wit' me girl and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
Yeah, it's all good, we gon' get it right
Take a trip wit' me girl, I might change ya life

[Verse 3: Travy P]
4AM, and I feel her rolling over
Tap me on the shoulder and she feeling all up on me
Must of left a good impression, probly 'cause I ain't stressing
I ain't even flexing, I'm just doing me and finessing, and
When I ain't home she calling on phone
Or leaving messages, she won't leave alone
I don't wanna cut her off, so I just don't hit her back
Then I hit her when I need her and I lay down the facts
I know that sound harsh, in some ways cruel
I just didn't wanna get our feelings misconstrued
So when I talk to you I only tell the truth
I can't change my ways, but I keep it real wit' you
'Cause

[Pre-Chorus: Travy P]
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
Girl you gon' love it like this, she love to be hittin' the splits
Do it like this, bitch, do it like this
But girl don't say I'm your only, 'cause I ain't one to get homely

[Chorus: Travy P]
I know that she good, she could get it right
She gon' show me if she bad, she could stay the night
Can I kick it like tribe, wouldn't that be nice
Come and bunk wit' me girl and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
And just spend the night, and just spend the night
Yeah, it's all good, we gon' get it right
Take a trip wit' me girl, I might change ya life
