[Verse 1: Seth Sentry]
Yo
At all times now I hear the darkness calling
Yeah it's closer than it was and I just can't ignore it
So this is paranoia
Where every finger's pointed
Where everything looks haunted
Yeah so this is madness for ya
Is crazy something a man is born with?
Or just some marijuana or the acid talkin'
Or the alcoholic in me, shit I wish I had the answers for 'em
But all I know is that it has it's claws in, and I just can't avoid it
Now every shadow is a tar pit boiling over, it's so close I feel my back is cornered
And if I had a small wish, I wish I hadda fought it
But now it's too late, cause everything's too damn distorted
Yeah, man I wish I knew what started all this
I need some help and sure I can't afford it
Nah fuck your help I need a lighter now to spark the joint, because I'm fading away to the same place that Drapht was falling
Seth is gone, death is storm, this the calm before it
I'm just trying to summon the courage to bite the bullet
(Do it)
The walls are talking, I swear to god this apartment's haunted
Could all this be paranormal?
(Nah this is madness for you)
And so it goes without saying this is my last recording
Cause if you're hearing this now it means I must have done it
First off I really need to tell you just how much I'm sorry
I know that the news of my death was gruesome and hard to stomach
I'm sorry too for those who end up in the bathroom scrubbing up the mess
I guess I was clumsy, this shit was far too bloody
Plus the blade it was blunt and it couldn't cut me properly
I was in such a hurry it's close and I can't outrun it

Goodbye

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh
Ever since a kid I felt this way
The black sheep, I can never rid myself of hate
And some will say it's a mental disease
Well I just pray that I can make it to the end of the week
It's like I'll only find happiness when dead or asleep
They say in time it'll get better for me, but it forever repeats
It's like I'm on the search to find my inner peace
And the fact I know it's never there is killing me
Cause I'll be honest I'm trying to make it work
It's all I can think about but it's likely to make it worse and it hurts
Am I positive, no, I just wanted to go
It's like I'm trapped in my mind and I'm not letting go
They try to help me but I won't let 'em touch me
Until you've been in my shoes don't ever judge me
The only thing that ever seems to excite me is the thought of me leaving this life
It's the demon inside me, it screams to release and it needs to be leaving
I make myself bleed just to see him
Don't be scared it doesn't hurt while I bleed
I live in hell, if you go and search you'll find me
I don't think this world and this earth's what I need
And I don't think this place is for a person like me
Is that really such a bad thing?
And people always point fingers but really don't understand him
I need to chill I wanna leave here, serious, I'm being real I don't wanna be here
Period
Hey yo fuck it my life's hell I hate it
99% of my life's dealt with anger
See I just wanna get a shotty, go and end it properly
Doing everybody and myself a favour
And they say that your life's what you make it
I didn't ask for my own life, but I'll take it
