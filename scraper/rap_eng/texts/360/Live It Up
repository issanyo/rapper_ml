[Refrain: Styalz Fuego]
There ain't no limit to us now
'Cause eventually always comes around
Oh, whether we die old or whether we die young
Gotta live it up till it’s gone

[Chorus: Stylaz Fuego & Dennis Dowlut]
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone

[Verse 1: 360]
Had a cloudy head, yeah, I know that
Since the fog cleared I’d never go back
And I’m grateful they shot me down
Or the person I am I would not be now
Yeah, it ain’t good to be bulletproof
'Cause in the end that bullet’ll be good for you
When I think of all the things I wouldn’t do now
If it wasn’t for that one little bullet wound
That means you gotta learn from mistakes
And no one person's the same
Don’t run from anything that hurts you to face
Each step you take you get further away
There’s a time when I thought of giving up
What I was living my life for it didn’t come
Now I haven’t got time for what I wouldn’t die for
I know that our life's short, so live it up

[Chorus: Stylaz Fuego & Dennis Dowlut (360)]
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone (gotta live it up)
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone (gotta live it up)

[Verse 2: Pez]
Yeah life's a journey I know that
And it doesn’t come with a road map
So you know to get through this maze
And along the way I made a few mistakes
Ever since then I
Left it all behind life's never been better
Head up in the clouds where it oughta be
Did it say life’s ordinary? But it’s not
Still for a minute I got in a rut
Imprisoned, I was limited and feeling stuck
Had my glass half empty, had to fill it up
Now I think I wanna get myself a bigger cup
That’s how the cards are dealt
Will it stay that way? Only time will tell
When I, think I wanna cry for help
I just try remind myself

[Pre-Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
There ain't no limit to us now
'Cause eventually always comes around
Oh whether we die old or whether we die young
Gotta live it up till it’s gone

[Chorus: Stylaz Fuego & Dennis Dowlut (360)]
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it’s gone (gotta live it up)

[Verse 3: 360 & Pez]
I don’t know what the future holds
I don’t know if I’ll achieve my goals
I just know life’s beautiful
Maybe that’s 'cause I’m living on cruise control
'Cause truth be told it doesn’t matter if ya
Make it the whole way up the ladder, just as
Long as you’re living out your dream
They used to tell me it was out of reach, but now
I am flying at a thousand feet
Never looking at the ground beneath
See I got rid of all the doubt in me
Who I was ain’t shit on what I’m about to be, because
Growing up all I heard was the same story
And if I don’t learn well the blames on me
So I started saying yes today
To all the things I said ‘no’ to yesterday

[Outro: Styalz Fuego]
Oh, whether we die old or whether we die young
Gotta live it up till it’s gone
Live it up till it's
