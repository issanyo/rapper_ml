[Intro: PEZ]
Uh
Yo, what up homies? Forthwrite's here
I know that you love us 'cause it's all I hear
Yep, PEZ and 360, come on, let's go
It's Ground Up 4, yep, you already know (Yo)
Three-six

[Verse 1: 360]
Hey, yo, my biceps define sex, but they're way too fuckin' big
Man, it makes it really hard for me to write cheques (Yeah)
That's the reason that I failed my sight test
And you should see how awkward it is when I do a mic check (One, two)
I only eat white bread if it's dyed red
'Cause my parents say it's easier to digest (Fuckin' eat it!)
And I'll be honest, yo, I really am a Nike head
That's why you see my mouth talkin' from a Nike tick (Hello, I'm Nike)
You better be warned, me and P are sendin' a storm
You would've seen it in your weather reports and warm
Your hands up and go and head for to door
You wanna stop it? Then you better applaud (Clap)

[Verse 2: PEZ]
'Cause when we perform, you see a sea full of people who tend to throw fits
So when I leave, they're all screamin' out "PEZ, your flow's sick!"
No shit, you don't think I know I'm dope bitch
I'm so fuckin' good that now I'm even on my own dick
And so Six, but shit yo, I'm so sick
Of livin' with no money to spend, I need some dough quick
'Cause I'm that broke kid who's so rich
That even though I own six homes, I'm still homeless with no crib
(Any change mate?) I get inspired to admire what is Showbiz (Uh)
But then inside, I'm sick and tired of havin' no gigs (Fuckin' hell)
I've had enough, the only reason that I don't quit
Is all the funny stories that I get from on our road trips (Check this one out)
Just last week, I was bathin' with a blowfish
My toe slipped, I hit the soap dish and left my throat slit
Plus my nose broke open 'cause my bones split
My hand snapped so I've got no fists, just low wrists
Which makes it fuckin' hard tryna smoke spliffs
'Cause they won't stick, so it's hard to get the dope lit
I'm so sad but me, knowin' I need dope
I light whole bags and just lean over the weed smoke
It's been so hard, still I'm tryna see hope
I keep starin' at my stumps, prayin' for some regrowth (Come on)
But it's not happenin', either I'm gonna snap or I'll
Be so seedy that you'll see me at a peepshow
Each and every week, close teeth with a C note
Tryna find a cheap ho to deep throat my meat loaf (Take it all down)
Eatin' free roast till I feel my ego
Is sweet and redeemed then a leave in a speedboat

[Verse 3: 360]
Ayo, PEZ, I feel a chill on my neck
'Cause when I said I'm rockin' ice, I meant a literal sense
It's Forthwrite motherfuckers, yeah, it's Sixty and PEZ
The same dudes who ripped it to shreds on Kick to the Head
I down four grams of coke, yo, I'm thinkin' I'm dead
Next life, I'm thinkin' I'll stick to the biccies instead
I'm a criminal head, I reckon prison's the best
'Cause they give you free dinners and they give you a bed
Yo, I think I'm the best, that's why I stick out my chest
With so many fly kicks, I'm leavin' ninjas impressed (Wah)
Yo, there's all these scene heads man, they're callin' me gay
'Cause I don't shave my head and wanna brawl with my mates (Fuck off)
I was born with a fork and a cork in my face
Mum had an abortion, the abortion was late
Yo, it took me five months to get her water to break
Then I popped out, lookin' like a corpse in a lake
Brunettes in group sex, yo, the orgies are great
But they caught me on tape like Shane Warnieâ€™s mistake (I'll bowl a flipper)
Yeah, I'm not the type to go and claim that we're the next shit
'Cause everybody already knows we're the best, shit!

[Outro: 360]
Now
I shouldn't have to repeat myself
But I'm going to
We're the best
Peace (Ha ha ha ha)
(Yeah, Forthwrite)
