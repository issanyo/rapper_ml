[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
Yeah, you will only ever be an angel to god
Five finger discount; I take what I want
Know what to in my race to the top
Now I know what my minds capable of
Male Aussie version of Amy Winehouse
I know the secret to stay alive now
I know my future I make it myself
That's right boy I create it right now
And fuck the mainstream
And fuck anybody who believes it changed me
If you really knew me you'd see the same me
You're probably mad at the world cause you ain't me
Now I know why my backs bent funny
Had a long career as a crash-test dummy
Yeah, that's the mentality of six
Get high all the time cause reality is shit

[Hook]
Tell these bitches
Ain't nothin' good come free
So keep on talkin that shit
You ain't even fuckin' with me
Let's go and tell these bitches
That I got nothin' to hide
So go worry 'bout your own shit
Instead of fuckin' with mine
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches

[Verse 2: 360]
I'm a different breed, come and see
What you all wantin' to be
Never be like three, I am he
Homie don't fuck with a king
When I say the word bitches
I ain't talkin' 'bout women
I'm talkin' 'bout jelly little fuck boys hatin'
I'm talkin' 'bout you if your with 'em
Ayo, wait for a minute
I'ma hit 'em in the face with a [?]
Yo save a chunk, it's my label cunt
In the end I make the decisions
They call me executive six, professional dick
I show 'em what effortless is
They want it then get in the ring
They never have seen so many consecutive wins
Finally here, walk in, breathin' fire in here
Earn more but you'll buy me the beer
One show's your entire career

[Hook]
Tell these bitches
Ain't nothin' good come free
So keep on talkin that shit
You ain't even fuckin' with me
Let's go and tell these bitches
That I got nothin' to hide
So go worry 'bout your own shit
Instead of fuckin' with mine
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches
Let's go tell these bitches
