[Ad-Libs: 360]
Uh, uh
Yeah
Yo
Yep, uh

[Verse 1: 360]
I was sent below, followin’ an endless road
Progression slow, but I’d rather that than never know
A lot of small things I feel I need to question though
And I know I’ll be better if I let ‘em go
I think back on which lesson to quote
But I can’t, can’t seem to remember the notes
And every second I hope to see a memory float
I’m in a bottomless pit so please send me a rope
I hate fakin’, the pain’s taking control
Try to tell the difference between my brain and my soul
To confront the emotions I feel
I hope and appeal to understand devotion is real to myself
Any odd pain, I turn and run
Every day I’m hopin' and prayin’ that my purpose comes
Will I make it in this earth as one?
Please be up front, ‘cause false hopes are worse than none, yeah

[Verse 2: Jeremedy]
I’ve got that ex-psyche ward type mind
Scribe rhymes on the type writes, tryna find a kind of finite
Answer, which is kinda like a phantom
Its presence can be felt but it can’t be physically fathomed
Shit, I've been to the maddest spaces in my imagination's atlas
Travelin' places for affirmation, a axis
But all I ever really found was understanding
Understanding that I could never quite understand it
I mean all of this, all of this in front of us
How could we ever try to comprehend the point of it?
Even if we figured it out, wouldn’t it be kinda spoilin’ it?
Then in the end we would really be missin’ the point of it
So I’m just avoidin’ it, you know, all these questions
I’ve been there, I’ve asked that, too much time invested in it
Guess my questions are in the form of raps and a beat
Not to figure it out for you, but to understand it for me

[Chorus: 360]
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand

[Verse 3: Jeremedy]
Take it back to the days when I wasn’t quite all there
Let you know where I got the ex-psyche ward stare
A time where my various personalities were all there
And they were all scared, yeah, a mind for the warfare
Found myself in a white room wearin’ all white robes
Never woulda been on this road if I'd have known
Spending all night alone, heavy crying and chokin'
Seemed like fire but [?] that I was smilin’ and copin'
But my soul was shut like, like Charlton Heston's heart
Now my head’s lookin’ like a big fuckin’ question mark
[?] so many times, I forget, where’s the start?
Your remedies pass full of the most dreadfulest scars
But it took an experience like that (Yeah) to understand
The fact that I’m alive is what I’ve come to thank
So if you need to question the truth, keep doing what you do (Yeah)
Not to figure it out for me, but to understand it for you

[Verse 4: 360]
Yo, I live in the present, feet embedded and I’m standin’ my ground
It might never be evident but, man, dammit, I’m proud
To stand in the clouds and show the world exactly what I’ve grown to be
Flaunt the inside of feelings that are known to me
I hope to see my mission's finished and refined
To the perfect expectations livin’ in this life
Innocence combined with an easily changed belief
Keep it the same and don’t just leave it as tainted dreams
There’s endless time for you to send a cry for help
But try and recognise and identify yourself
With substance, meaning and a purpose to grow
When you’re truly content, well then the curtains will close
And then it’s over, completed it’ll help you to fight
I can’t tell you the price for my value for life
I held on and strived to be a man, happy and attached with pride
Unearthin’ in the deepest me, then I’m satisfied
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
(Understand the way)
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) Uh, uh
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) But we'll never know
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) So let it go

[Chorus: 360]
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand (Understand the way)
