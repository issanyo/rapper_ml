[Verse 1: 360]
Looking at an angel with a devil in her ear
Saying four letter words
That are making her turn, to everything she fears
Follow them and they'll clear whatever's in her head
As it burns, it gets worse
It's a curse and she'll turn, depression will appear

[Refrain: 360]
The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
O—oo—o—oo—ah

[Pre-Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Forced her halo away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

[Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing

[Verse 2: 360]
Lookin' at an angel with a devil in her ear
Now the roles are reversed, and she's breaking a curse
She's nearly in the clear
Fly away from anyone telling you to steer
To the person you were, cause without 'em you're perfect
Now heaven will appear

[Refrain: 360]
The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
O—oo—o—oo—ah

[Pre-Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Forced her halo away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

[Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing

[Verse 3: 360]
Why do we all have to find love?
Instead of just letting it find us?
I cannot tell if I'm blind drunk
Or live in a way that the sky does
I signed up
For that mind fuck that that high does
Wait for the day that that time's up
Cause I'm sick of just spending our time up
Feel like I'm loosing my head
Viewing the end, don't want a funeral yet
Cannot go through it again
Feel like I'm writing the plot of a beautiful death
And they say that, if you love somebody, set them free
So, even though this shit's hard to do, you gotta let me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Forced her halo away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

[Chorus: Kiara Fox]
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
With a clipped wing
Spiral down, spiral down
