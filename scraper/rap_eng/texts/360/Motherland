[Verse 1: PEZ]
Yeah, I heard a calling
Looked up to the sky, all of the words were falling
So that, I felt like in that moment
That I'd been chosen to live out my dream, but now I see
Anything and everything that I ever wrote
Has taken me down an endless road to see her, but will she ever show
Her face, or this place just a figment that I'm tryna chase?

[Chorus: Raymes]
I've been waiting all my life
To get (to get)
To the motherland
To the motherland
I've been waiting all my life
To get (to get)
To the motherland

[Pre-Verse: PEZ]
Yeah
I just
Never thought it'd come to this

[Verse 2: PEZ]
'Cause when I was younger I guess I foresaw a particular way I'd be living my life
I just never thought I'd be sitting here watching it as it went by
Stuck in a group of my minds and that I'm always frightened
And unsure, it's like I don't know what I'm writing
Anymore, and I'm sure
There's a reason for these demons that won't leave, but I can't ignore
This feeling deep down in my soul, it's telling me
I should believe what I've been told, or is it believe what I've been sold
It's all a question now, are you there? It's hard to know
Ask myself, my heart says no, still I keep feeling like I can't let go
And I know, it's crazy to complain
But I guess I keep hoping that you'll save me from this pain
I'm in, I've been

[Chorus: Raymes]
I've been waiting all my life
To get (to get)
To the motherland
To the motherland
I've been waiting all my life
To get (to get)
To the motherland
To the motherland

[Bridge: Raymes]
It's the same old story
Written on a page again
Looking for a way out
Of a maze I've lost in for a while
And I want to find it
But I just don't know how
Please send me a sign to say
Where you are hiding

[Outro: Raymes]
To the motherland
