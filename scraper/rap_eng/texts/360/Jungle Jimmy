[Intro]
Motherfuckin' yo
It's Tommy Sixx
Jungle Jimmy cunt
What's good cunt?
Let's fuckin' get it cracking cunt

[Verse 1]
Do you feel what I say? (I do) 'Cause I say what I feel (Whoo!)
I'm high as fuck without takin' a pill (sober!)
Not aimin' for a killing but I'm aimin' to kill
Won't say no that I'm makin' a mil'
Plenty of fish so I aim for gills (straight for the gills)
I start rolling, arsehole with my arms folded
Mark Holden, say something that ain't nothing, my heart's cold as
[?] anybody want it, they're like "hell no"
I just want to know if Adele wrote "Hello" doing hard times on the cellphone

[Bridge (sampled)]
They ask me what's my goal, then they like "what the fuck"
'Cause I don't want the crown, for me, that's not enough
Yo, I can see the future, I'm the best that's ever livin'
And I've got four years, that's twenty-twenty vision

[Verse 2]
Bent dick's what I'm known for
Bagged a ten since o-four
She see the D she like "no more"
She feel the tip she's like "No, more!"
I'm so raw, you don't wanna be the one to know more
They turn it out, go work it out
I got a perfect house, no floors
Three-Six-O the name brand, check it while I rain-dance
I yearn for the moot, head first in the bush, faceplant
Findin' yourself is like findin' your keys
Find the best tits and you sign them and leave
If you be cold and you're likely to freeze
Hug on my dick 'cause it's ninety degrees
(I hope you actually get that) I had to redefine peace of mind
(Whaddup?) Kidnapped DJ Khaled just to key his ride
That's another one, anybody want to get into it
Yo, they never do it 'cause they fuckin' run, won't stop till we number one
I gotta shout your mum ('sup babe) yo, that's my favourite lover
(She is) 'Cause, when we fuck, we like to do it like we hate each other
(Take it bitch!) I'm on a beast mode tip, I got the cheat code bitch
Go find the best porn star, tell her to deep throat this
(Deep throat this mate) See you don't know how big my ego is
Yo, I might travel the world now that's an ego trip
I'm on fire, I don't have to warm up
Yo. I thought that Instagram was an app to score drugs, go

[Outro]
Yeah
So, I might be sober and off all the drugs and all that shit, but
I'm still kinda scattered from my last bender
So, I'm still gonna make out of it songs like this all the time
Uh, my brain is forever fuckin' cooked
Jungle motherfuckin' Jimmy
Tommy Sixx
Forthwrite bitch
