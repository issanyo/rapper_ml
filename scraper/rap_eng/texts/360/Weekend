[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Verse 1: PEZ]
Man, you know I tried my luck at a few day jobs
And every single one I had I used to hate on
I swear to God, I'd wake up every morning with a fake cough
Hoping maybe I could get the day off
I knew the safe option was to stay on
Still I couldn't help but muck around till I got laid off
Rapping all day long tryna make songs
Thinking to myself 'I hope this hard work pays off'
So I told my friends "I'm an emcee"
And they were like "PEZ, you're a deadbeat" (yeah)
How're you gonna make the ends meet
Rent's steep, you won't even make it to the next week
And it seemed like
There was a pretty good chance they would be right
But I just kept holding onto my dream like "Nah
I'm gonna get there in the end, but in the meantime"

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Verse 2: 360]
Before rap I was different in a way
Tryna make a living as a chippy in the game
My boss figured out a minimum to pay
He was giving me a wage, I was literally a slave
When's this motherfucka giving me a raise?
I can barely afford to put some dinner on my plate
Spent every day wishing it'd rain
'Cause every time it rains you'd be finished for the day
PEZ told me to give the shit away
"Fuck work, there's something bigger we can chase"
Taught about belief and the difference it'd make
Little did he know I would quit within a day
And while at work I was dreaming (dreaming)
Always thinking 'bout the weekend (weekend)
I couldn't wait till the week ends
And it will end, but until then

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Bridge (Extended): PEZ]
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend
Is on my mind
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend
Is on my mind

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
We all live for the weekend
Just tryna get by
But losing track of time
And we never need a reason
To leave it all behind
There's only one thing on my mind

[Bridge: PEZ]
In the deep end
On the grind
'Nother weekend
Is on my mind
