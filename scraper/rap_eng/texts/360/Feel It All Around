[Verse 1: 360]
Uh, I never thought when I'd written down my goal list
That I'd be standin' here ticking off the whole shit
And I'd be sittin' there like, "Oh, shit"
Prob'ly forget 'cause most of my memories gone like a goldfish
Let's go, Benzo with a Valium
Nose takes cocaine, feelin' like a stallion
And you feelin' what I'm tellin' 'em it's all because I'm free though
Words form together from the weed smoke
That uncut shit, that puff puff shit
On my back skin pink lookin' sun-kissed
Thinkin' 'bout back in class doin' dumb shit
Couldn't play an instrument but mastered the trumpet
Roll that spliff right, roll that shit tight
We will sit tight, hittin' it till midnight
I'm in a cloud of smoke, but I don't write for nothin'
No, 'cause this shit is a dime a dozen

[Chorus: Ernest Greene (Sampled) & 360
You feel it all
Around yourself
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah
You know it's yours
And no one else
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, you know the shit you only read about
Shit you only dream about, anythin' is possible, I've seen it now
But if only I could teach the crowd how
I just said fuck the fast, I'm gonna take the scenic route
I ain't drivin' [?] 'cause I don't own a car
I got a licence to blaze towards an open sky
I am flyin' away on Noah's arc
Been glidin' for days findin' a place where I can go and park
Stop carin' what these other rappers think
I can hear my angel tellin' me she understands my wish
I ain' carin' if I'm gettin' paid a hundred grand a gig
I just wanna make enough to make my fuckin' family rich
I ain't braggin', I'm just keepin' it real
And I don't believe that I can, I believe that I will
Fast break all day, I've been ahead from the start
But I am so fuckin' high, my best friend is a star

[Chorus (Extended): Ernest Greene (Sampled) & 360
You feel it all
Around yourself
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah
You know it's yours
And no one else
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah
You feel it all
Around yourself
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah
You know it's yours
And no one else
It took a long time to get up, to get up
All I know's I gotta keep my head up, yeah
