[Intro: Chance Waters & 360]
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
That sounds ridiculous

[Verse 1: Chance Waters]
I don't make
Catchy songs with claps and tongs
[?] management wants
And I'll never drop some catchy lines that
All my fans could rap along with
You probably think I'm sad and whatnot
But those who know me know I love carryin' on
Just last week I went to Katie Holmes vacation home
Then camped out the front yellin', "Marry me, Tom!"
Well, that's a lie, but I did steal their family dog (uh-huh)
And then I tried to ransom it off (yeah)
That's not true either, but I'm happy a lot
I just don't make songs 'bout the candy shop
I've never snatched a watch or carried a Glock
I've never bashed or robbed or acted the boss
You won't catch me off on some arrogant pop star shit
My album might flop, hell, bring it right on

[Chorus: Joyride]
We go write catchy
Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune
That's stuck in your head
Just ignore it

[Verse 2: Smizzy]
If you think I make catchy songs then you're actually wrong
I knew a kid who used to and he got bashed a lot
So my songs are only half sick, shit, ask 6
Musically I'm a fuckin' Maxibon
And yeah, I could write and sing all the same stuff as James Blunt
Pack out stadiums with ladies and get paid tons (I could)
But I keep it raw like Tame One's [?]
Flip it back and forth like Forthwrite all night
And we could climb the charts till I'm pickin'
Lobster meat out my teeth with my least favourite ARIA
Without goin' "La—di—da—di—da, la—di—da—di—da"
Soundin' like we're tryna party hard at the Mardi Gras
Kanye tried and looked awfully stupid
Look at him now, he's gettin' bored of music
Next thing he'll probably put out a porno movie
And even then I bet the bitch'd have autotuning

[Interlude: Smizzy]
"Glad you got Kanye [?] that good, that good, that good"
"Oh, Mr Fishstick"

[Chorus: Joyride]
We don't write catchy
Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune
[?] stuck in your head
Just ignore it

[Verse 3: 360]
Uh
What's the definition of catchy? ([?])
Is it some'in' that's repetitious and happy? (Yep)
Yeah, you can bet I'm killin' my cabbie
If he plays catchy shit, but I never been in a taxi (I haven't)
I don't get down with beautiful tune shit
And I fuckin' hate musical music (fuck)
I wanna slap any dude that'll do this
If you got talent singin' don't use and abuse it
Some call it hate, some call it jealousy
Music's so great as long as there's no melody
And anytime it sticks in my head
Is the only time Iwish I was dead, "Can you kill me?" (Please)
I hate everything that Nova plays
Even "The Festival Song" is overplayed (ha ha)
It's enough to make me go insane
And there's too much catchy shit, here we go again, like

[Chorus: Joyride]
We go write catchy
Songs that all the
Kids can sing along
With
And I'm sorry if
We wrote the tune
That's stuck in your head
Just ignore it

[Outro: Joyride]
Just ignore it
If it's stuck in your head
Yeah, yeah
If it's stuck in your head
Just ignore
