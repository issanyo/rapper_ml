[Intro]
Slow it down

[Verse 1: 360]
Uh, I'm here to talk about love
A certain feeling when you walk with a buzz
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout the person, yo, it's more than enough
I'll be upfront, I'm kind of scared of falling in love
It's the falling part, I'm scared of being caught and then stuck
Inside of her mind kind of design with no control
Walking in with everything and leaving with a broken soul
All hope's revolve around you try to see in hindsight
Nothing else matters now, it seems you got a blinded mind
I try to find the right girl in the right time
I need to breath and proceed to read the right signs
Where's the guidelines? I need some sort of help for now
I speak to anyone who thinks that they can help me out
I've held it out in front, I'm feeling kind of guilty though
That if I didn't change my ways it woulda killed me slowly
My shields up 'cause real love conceals me
And when she knows the real me whether she'll really feel me

[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Verse 2: 360]
It took me years to reach the level where I'm at
That confused way of thinking, yo, I'll never get it back
And you've got years to grow, I know it takes time
But I can't be your boyfriend and your teacher at the same time
'Cause I need you on the same level I'm at
'Cause where I'm at now my brain's at a climax
And why's that? 'Cause I learnt to love my own company
And underneath my blood I've got a lot of love for me
Your physical's good if were bumpin' for the night
But what turns me on is if you're doing something with your life
'Cause I'm gonna wanna chick who's ambitious
Passionate too and who sticks to plans, listens
And got her shit together and she's hardly in need
Open honesty, always wears her heart on her sleeve
And that's it, when you find yourself you'll find me
But this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

[Verse 3: 360]
I know it ain't easy to say ya need me
Believe me, I'm gonna be pushed away if you needy
Need and want, they're two separate identities
But now you're in a state where you'll go and try anythin'
To be around me, can't be alone by yourself
Don't rely on me though, because I won't be your help
That's not harsh, I'm actually helping you in the long run
But once you found your feet you'll go and get that job done
But that don't mean that I'll never be around
'Cause I'm here whenever I can, whenever you be down
But if I'm the only thing that can pick you up
I can't have that pressure whenever all of this shit gets tough
You gotta sort all your own shit out first
Work it out yourself when you're feelin' like an outburst
This song's here and it's out to help
But know you'll find me once you've found yourself
It shows

[Chorus (Extended): 360 & Countbounce]
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need
All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need
