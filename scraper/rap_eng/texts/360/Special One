Ground Up!

[Intro: PEZ]
Yeah, I know what you think
Forthwrite, they talk a lot of shit
They don't have any feelings
Well, you're wrong
We've got those special girls in our life
And we just want to send the love out
Let 'em know about it
Tell 'em how we feel
We're not afraid to do it
Here it is
Set it off, '60

[Verse 1: 360]
She was my high school sweetheart
She looked a bit like a retard
Unique in every single way she moved each arm
That companionship, I'll never get back
You used to drool, you can't get more special than that
I loved how her bottom lip was incredibly fat
I was attracted to her lockjaw and bend in her back
The hardest worker, yeah, she won a medal for that
She had a Terminator smile with the metal attached
And when I think about her, the night won't glow
With her cute little face with her eyes so close
And the way you kind of snorted whenever we kissed
My little special thing, you'll forever be missed
From me

[Hook: 360 & PEZ]
You are my special one (ayo, I feel that 6)
You are my special one (that's love)
You are my special one (uh, PEZ)
You are my special one

[Verse 2: PEZ]
She was my high school fat chick, she looked a bit like a spastic
The way she'd miss her mouth when she had chips
Askin' for its cause and effect
So because she had a limp, she had a pause in her step (yep)
I used to love it when the class was in session
The way she'd always stutter when you'd ask her a question
And her obsession with tryna buy food
Even though it was so hard for her to do (it's true)
All she wanted was a doughie with some jam and some damn cream
But they couldn't understand her at the canteen
(What's she saying?) Man, I miss her being in my car
'Cause that handicapped sticker made it easier to park
I love you

[Hook: 360]
You are my special one
You are my special one (my special one)
You are my special one (you are my special one)
You are my special one
You are my special one (my special one)
You are my special one (my special one)
You are my special one (I love you)
You are my special one (yeah)
You are my special one
You are my special one
You are my special one
You are my special one
