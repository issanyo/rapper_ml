[Sample]
Was wird daraus? Wenn der Bruno mal tot geht?
Wo landen diese Sachen, wo landen diese Instrumente?
Was wird daraus?

[Intro]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
Where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
I done made it through the pain and the strife
It's my turn now, my world, my might, my light
My life, my life
My life

[Ad-Libs]
Uh-huh
Oi, stand the fuck up, idiot!
Tommy Sixx, bitch
Yeah
Flight so rare, it's too fast, I don't care

[Verse]
Hi, I am off my face
I am happy because life's great
I am usin' the music I do
While refusin' to do any job I hate
And I party like nobody else
And if you ain't down then I'm on my way
Wakin' up on a random couch
Like, "Who the fuck are you? This is not my place"
I am ready for whatever they bring
If you think you the shit, yo, step in the ring
Competitive as ever, I am everything
And put in energy to never think a negative thing, no
"So why do you call yourself 360?"
"Wanna rap, ayy? Fuck out of my face" Fuck off
Stop thinkin' you can take my crown
All of y'all should just lay right down
Stop sayin' that I changed my sound
I'm on top of my game right now
Give a fuck if my sound is changin'
You should see the amount I'm savin'
And plus I'm attracted to beats
When you're listenin' in and the ground is shakin'
Watch everybody love my shit
I ain't even on that punchline tip
Bring the haters out, you can hate me now
Guess what? You can suck my dick

[Outro]
'Cause this is my life
This is my life
