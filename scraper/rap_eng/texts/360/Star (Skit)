[Skit]
Yeah
Baby, it's been a while
It's been a while since I've had my last singing lessons
But I'm back now
Maybe you can make it up to me?
We're both humans, we're both spiritual humans
We're both beings on this planet of Earth
Beautiful, beautiful on the inside and out
Oh, don't be sorry, don't be sorry, Dianne... you're quite in tune
But maybe there is one thing
Give me one of them rim jobs I've been hearing about
You just gotta twinkle your tongue around my star
Around my mudflap, around my entrance, virgin purity
I ain't gonna go down on your front bum
You're just gonna go down on my back hole
Put it in my stink, that's the way we want it down here
And then we'll call it even
Just make sure that your tongue moves in a circular motion
Semi-circles or full, it doesn't matter

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been a-waiting for you, now I see you looking at me
Maybe you can eat my star? Mmm
But, baby, never worry, I clean after every borry
Come on, baby, eat my arse
And whether on the boat or maybe on your leather sofa
You can lick me in my exit wound
So, baby, lick my ring and when you do it, I might sing
So people hear us in the next room, yeah

[Refrain]
Eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, lick me on my arse
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star
Baby, eat me on my star

[Ad-Libs]
Ooh, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ooh, that's so good! Yeah! Yeah, lick me on my arse!
Lick me on my arse! Lick me on my arse!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yoooooo!
Penis and poo-poos, penis and poo-poos
And pubic hairs and Rubik's cubes
