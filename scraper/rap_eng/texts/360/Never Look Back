[Intro]
Ha ha, yeah
That's the way, uh
Rest in peace J.D
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
It's 360
Forthwrite
Yeah, yeah (Uh), yeah, yeah ([?])
Ha ha ha ha *clears throat*, oh yeah
Yo

[Verse 1]
It's the nice dude who's easy to speak to
To know what life's about without seein' a preview
And easily see-through the dudes who ain't real
Choose my fate even if losin' a late meal and
I like my songs to have feelings
And whether speakin' out crap or letting out what's concealed in
All these dudes love trains, every ride is planned
But I'm different, me? I'd rather ride a tram
With my headphones on, I'm daydreamin'
To pave the way, take it to slate 'cause it ain't even
I stay breathin', awake to the inner city
Walk a different path to plan like I was sippin' whiskey
Go to Vanilla Bay to say “hey”
Down paninis when I'm takin' the paper the same day
I'm a loud mouth, I fiend for the loud crowd
Rock a show hard then lounge down at the town house
And when it's time to wake, I bounce out
As I fiend for the people to love me and bow down
As I fiend for the people to love me and bow down
Give us a proud crowd and say that it's ours now (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I can see all this life just happenin'
And I can see all this stuff just happenin'
And I can see all this rap just happenin'
And when it does, yo, I won't look back again
And I can see all this life just happenin'
And I can see all this stuff just happenin'
And I can see all this rap just happenin'
And when it does, yo, I won't look back again

[Verse 2]
And when I left the scene, it felt like some fresh air
To not walk around a bunch of nutters giving death stares
Is this kid really serious? Yeah, maybe
What? You don't think he is because his hair's crazy?
He loves to run around, representin' Forthwrite
'Cause he knows they're bringin' the noise like an exhaust pipe
Only money made is Centrelink on fortnights
Battered with bad vision, the opposite of hawks' eyes
But then he saw his mask, it left him torn apart
Born to ask questions about this [shit] we callin' art
It's sort of hard, we're out livin' a confused life
He'll talk his heart then they're givin' him a bruised eye
If you're the type to see or believe sin
The only way to talk, you need to be preachin'
Don't follow when you don't believe what they're teachin'
And speak out, bring the freedom of speech in
Yeah, speak out, bring the freedom of speech in
Yeah, speak out, bring the freedom of speech in
MCs just make sure you speak out
Peace out, I gotta just leave now, uh (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I can see all this life just happenin'
And I can see all this stuff just happenin'
And I can see all this rap just happenin'
And when it does, yo, I won't look back again
And I can see all this life just happenin'
And I can see all this stuff just happenin'
And I can see all this rap just happenin'
And when it does, yo, I won't look back again

[Outro]
Ha ha ha, yeah
You know you like it
Signin' out
