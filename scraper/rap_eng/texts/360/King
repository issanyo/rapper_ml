[Intro: Martian]
Yeah
All right, all right, all right

[Chorus: Martian]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Whoo, said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing

[Verse 1: Martian]
Yeah, uh
They see me gaining speed, they treating me like royalty
I'm 'bout to build a dream where all these fans be spoiling me
I'm 'bout to build a team so go and pledge your loyalty
Now that my green is mean these fiends be tryna foil me
I came here with plenty of promise and emptied them pockets
Somewhere between earning plenty of profit and being a prophet
If you and your crew get to talking that shit I suggest that you stop it
They told me to go for gold, but I prefer platinum to be honest (Man, I'm feeling obnoxious)
Tell me where the crown at? Now, where the best girl in your town at?
Got my red robes in a backpack, star wise I got king down pat
I'm ready, on my work, yo, I keep it steady, on the bass, yo, I keep it heavy
On the crowd, yo, I keep 'em ready, I'ma work till I keep it sweaty
Lights up and it's showtime, getting head so deep that I blow minds
I flow fine with dope lines so don't try to cosign, I'ma showboat mine
I'm so fly make waves like a boat drive, so ask your girl who she been texting
See your next chick is my ex-bitch, yeah, I wreck shit, homie, you guessed it

[Chorus: Martian]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing
(Ayy '60)

[Verse 2: 360]
Trust me yo, they don't want it, most of 'em going through
The motions with their flows, yo, they robotic, bro, stop it
Nobody can say that they the realest when I'm so honest
Me, myself, and I, fuck me off and you'll know both of us
Trust me yo, we won't stop it, making sure our own job is
Balling 'round the world like the Globetrotters
Every day we thrown offers, chilling in that throne office
Reaping what the throne offers so never taking the throne off us (Nup)
Ain't talkin' my massive dick, but yo, I'm so cocky
State of mind is always on that bogan shit, 'No worries'
Yeah, I made my own lane then I drove on it
Everybody wanna set a trend, we the motherfuckers that have both done it
Sound now's going down south, everybody wanna go or go on it
My gal now's got a foul mouth, she get more beeps than the Roadrunner
(Like damn) I can't preach 'cause I'm no prophet
They say time is money, or money is time
Either way I make the most of it

[Chorus: Martian & 360]
I'm a king
Yeah, said I'm a king
Said I'm a mo'fucking king
And we ain't worried 'bout a thing

[Outro: Martian & 360]
Yeah
Mini Coop, 360
Level up, haha
