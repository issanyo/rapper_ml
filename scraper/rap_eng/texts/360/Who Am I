[Ad-Libs: 360]
Uh
Yeah
Yeah
Yo

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, honestly I try and keep my head in the sky
And keep reminding people always that it's better to fly
It's meant to be fine, life should get better with time
But it's hard to see the positive in negative vibes
And I'll never be remembering the lessons that they sold us
Yeah, I've got some shows but no energy to roll up
It's getting hard to take the pressure on my shoulders
The need to succeed is getting stressful now I'm older
Pez, I'm praying that our chemistry will hold up
I hate always pretending to my parents I'm a solider
And if it really came to offing myself
I would, to make them happy I would offer myself
And in five years I'll go and get a job if it helps
But give me one shot, and if it doesn't work I'll fuck off
And with music, yo, I'm hungry with an appetite
I'd rather die than sacrifice where my passion lies
I'm on the grind to make it happen, I don't fantasise
I'm really living right now, I don't need to act alive
You're scared of losing your job but it's not anything
You need to understand prosperity's not everything
Religious nuts who think they've come to meet their maker
You don't worship anything except a fuckin' piece of paper
Don't get me wrong, yo, I would love to see a saviour
But I got a life to live, I'll deal with brother Jesus later
And talk about world leaders getting named in songs
Anybody put into power's gonna get hated on
And yo, I'm sorry, yo, this verse might be crazy long
But I'm just writing every train of thought my brain is on

[Ad-Libs: PEZ]
Yeah
Real talk, uh

[Verse 2: PEZ]
So do we have a cause? I wonder, damn, I'm too undermanned
Tryin' to understand what this planet's for
There's a manic force that's attacking back and forth
Anxious thoughts only 'cause they only make me panic more
Afraid to sleep 'cause the same dreams I had before
Keep on coming back for more and so the pain repeats
Honestly, I know there's probably a way to be free of this shit
But I'm not seeing it, shit
See, I'm well aware that my awareness is a rareness
But I'm scared it's gonna be the death of me 'cause it's tempting me
Damn, I hope that's not the reason it all ends for me
I'll try to keep my head up-up until the Reaper's sent for me
But there's these questions and they never seem to let me be
Every week so tense, shit, it's an effort just to get to sleep
I feel my body now covered in tension
I didn't wanna end up here, nah, I had other intentions
If I was different then maybe I'd see some movement
I'd take it and keep on moving, nah, I'm just being stupid
The truth is, I can see this wisdom is a gift
I don't know why I always try to say it isn't 'cause it is
But I can also see the reason they say ignorance is bliss
Looking back from where I'm at, see, it's the innocence I miss
Give me just a little bit, if there was anything that I could
Wish for with a wish, I'd say you've gotta know I wanna go
Back, back, and live with a mind
Back in a simpler time so I don't think all the time (Time)
Shit, I'm sorry if I'm raving on, I didn't mean to take this long
But that was just the train of thought my brain was on
