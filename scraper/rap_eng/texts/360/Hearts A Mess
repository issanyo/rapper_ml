[Chorus: Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah, yo)

[Verse 1: 360]
Fuck I'm sick of this anxiety
Feel like my brain is a massive gang fighting me
It's the last thing I want but it's fast in
Feeling like this shit is taking over and I can't think
Honestly I'm on the brink of insanity
With no luck and no fuckin' grip on reality
I try to block it out but it's too hard to keep ignorin'
How can I when I don't know the reason for it
I wish I didn't have to react
This depression, yo, it has to be that, I'm having panic attacks
Doctors want to give me anti-depressants
But fuck that I know that it won't answer the questions
Yo I need some love, tried to see a shrink
But I fuckin' hate it, always feel like I'm being judged
To most people yo I know I'm not seeming fucked
I've got the best shield I'm knowing how to keep it up

[Chorus: Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah)

[Verse 2: 4TH]
It's like I always live in the past tense
Think of the steps to here, quick to discard them
Always missing a mark and
Pickin' apart what I did and what I can't get
Best friendin' me to myself it seems
My energy's giving a selfish means
My self esteem's driven by my never content nature
I love the chase, never shelf the dream
No matter how unattainable it may be
'Cause even if I fall short, it's all forward, maybe
Till the devil that's on my shoulder
Tells me silver lining looks better a little golder
Damn, in the mirror like "Look at yourself
Where's your head at? You're crooked as hell"
Got me reaching for that angel, in need of a halo
Instead, I'm right here, speakin' to a stranger

[Chorus (Extended): Gotye (Sampled)]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
