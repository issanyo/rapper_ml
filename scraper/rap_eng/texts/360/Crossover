[Verse 1: 360]
Let's headbutt clouds, I got a feeling you ain't falling down
Now I've reached a certain understanding what it's all about
Of such a small amount, life is what we talk about
You could be the shortest out, feel like you the tallest now
Go ahead and use me 'cause I'ma use you
And don't worry, I won't judge you if you use too
And you should probably use one, but I'ma use two
Don't be shocked about it, this is somethin' that I'm used to
Just love life with me, 'cause love's fine with me
Just unwind, come fly one time with me
I can feel it now, I'm way above takin' off
The negative, just shake it off, starin' in the face of God
I like to play a lot, play a lot
Maybe you can be the one to make me stop but, then again, maybe not
But, see, I'm knowing I should set you free
Now, my mind'll never let you leave, I think I'm crossing over

[Chorus: Katy B (Sampled)]
I could out your every wrong to right
I will be your sanctuary tonight
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
I'm the only friend you will need to know
Give me all your troubles, let them go
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside

[Verse 2: Infinite]
Yeah
Late night (late night), another black hole suck us in
We wondering where we are, wonder when the tunnel ends
It doesn't seem close, but I'm feeling good
And I hear that devil in my head, telling me I should
What's the innocent, never missed a step
But, tonight, the steps get harder since we've met
I was getting tired, you were wired, what a bad mix
But it's thriving on a thrill too, so inviting, need to have it
On a tail, I bite, like I ain't have any say
And let the cycle motion on and grab us away
Slow motion like I'm floating when the gravity fades
The lights flashing like I'm out on a stage
I know it's bad, but I doubt I can change
Though I try, but failure doesn't seem to counter the pain
So it helps, though I know it won't last forever
Still, the next day, I'm at it again, I think I'm crossing over

[Chorus: Katy B (Sampled)]
I could out your every wrong to right
I will be your sanctuary tonight
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
I'm the only friend you will need to know
Give me all your troubles, let them go
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside

[Bridge: Katy B (Sampled)]
It's way too hot outside
And you can't trust anyone
You've had a long, hard ride
And the day's hardly begun
You've got nothing to lose
They took it all while you looked away
I know you've paid your dues
Do you need somewhere to stay?

[Chorus: Katy B (Sampled)]
I could out your every wrong to right
I will be your sanctuary tonight
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
I'm the only friend you will need to know
Give me all your troubles, let them go
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
