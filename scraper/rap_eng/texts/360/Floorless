[Chorus: Travy P (360)]
They can hear me, they don't see me though
Nowadays on my UFO
In a league of my own
Don't tell me what they want
Don't say it's been my time (Ayy)
Right now I'm just living life (Ayy)
You know what I'm hear to do (Yeah)
So I've got nuttin' to prove (Let's go)

[Verse 1: 360]
Fuck money (Why?) Poor, no (Oh)
Sex cells (Yeah?) Hormone (Ha)
Take off (What?) Your clothes (Yeah)
I got it down to a T (No wardrobe)
We came a long way from selling albums in the boot
Now we drop a song and see the shit has landed on the news
When you're makin' money watch what family do 'cause
That's how you decide whoever's relative to you
If you rate this and feel this dog then make a playlist
Of the real 6 God and be the channel with the views
Money so high up but it fuckin' won't die
But if numbers don't lie then I'm tellin' 'em the truth
I"ll rock a purse, that crazy bitch
When I drop a verse, yo, a fat lady sings
I think my mum and dad should get back making kids
If I ain't the best born fuckin' Matt Damon is

[Chorus: Travy P (360)]
They can hear me, they don't see me though
Nowadays on my UFO
In a league of my own
Don't tell me what they want
Don't say it's been my time (Don't say it's been my time)
Right now I'm just living life (Livin' life)
You know what I'm hear to do (You know what I'm hear to do)
So I've got nuttin' to prove

[Verse 2: 360]
Hey yo, I'm grimy, recording every verse up in a payphone
Do it by the book, but I'm skimming every page though
You'll be bored as until the time you see play though
Even as support act I'm still the fuckin' main show
I can find a silver lining every time it rains though
Grab the pot of gold while they lookin' at that rainbow
Ninety-five percent is the amount I'ma save though
The other five is fuck around money, call it Play-Doh
Why does everybody in this game rap the same?
I can put a fuckin' stop to this shit: Drake flow
Body all these unknown bitches: Jane Doe
When I say bitches I'm talkin' 'bout how many
Figures will I aim for, I can figure eight more
Grade me on the paper, boy, why you want that A4?
You ain't in the same league, let alone the same sport
You can't put a baseball player next to a racehorse

[Verse 3: Travy P]
Been a minute, now I'm back in it
Thought I was down, now I'm back winning
Thought I would lose, huh? Yeah
But I ain't no loser (Travy)
I ain't ever fell off
Always been a good fella, yeah
Veteran like De Niro
So now I stack hella zero's
Pent house on the top floor
I guess I ain't got no floors, dog
Girl, suck me like she jawless
Shang Tsung, I be flawless
Shang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah
Shang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah
Shang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah
Shang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah

[Chorus: Travy P (360)]
They can hear me, they don't see me though
Nowadays on my UFO
In a league of my own
Don't tell me what they want
Don't say it's been my time (Don't say it's been my time)
Right now I'm just living life (Livin' life)
You know what I'm hear to do (You know what I'm hear to do)
So I've got nuttin' to prove
