[Intro: PEZ]
It’s that Forthwrite sexual shit
Yeah
Uh

[Hook: 360]
It's time for some dry sex, we ain't gotta take our clothes off yet
We can wear our pants and just rub and hug
'Cause see I don’t wanna fuck
Before we make love, let's make our fabric touch

[Verse 1: 360]
I love dry sex, so there's no need for a condom
Yeah, go ahead, girl, and leave your socks on
I like your cotton, dreaming of your tees and scarves
You might even see me hard for a leotard
I like those socks, I like those tops
Fuck a blow job, I'd rather get a clothes job
I want pants, I want just jeans
My dick stings while I'm rubbin' on that front seam
But I like it, rubbing on the blue's clues
You could wear a boob tube or your shoes too
Any brand, even Fubu
And if you haven't got your hoodie on, you better go and put it on
Gaze at any girls who's wearing some linen
I don't just glare at the women, yo, I'll stare and admit it (ahh)
You got mad 'cause I saw you in the change rooms
But you were wearing clothes, bitch, so I blame you (yeah)
Clothes are everything, skin's not a better thing
Anything that's leopard skin, denim things are better thick
Yeah, girl
Just leave 'em on (clothes)

[Hook: PEZ]
It's time for some dry sex, we ain't gotta take our clothes off yet
We can leave our pants on and just rub and hug
And maybe roll on the ground
Before we make love, let's, let's fool around

[Verse 2: PEZ]
I love sex, but I always cum real quick
So let's keep our clothes on so I don't feel shit (yeah)
And I can rub on your Dolce & Gabbana
While we're rolling on the carpet and you hold me on the arse
It feels good (yeah) well, actually it doesn't
'Cause it practically does nothing
But let's keep on rubbing anyway
I like your bras and lingerie
'Cause without 'em, those parts would be on display
And I don’t like that, I don't like flesh
I like tight skirts, I like dresses
I like foreplay, get some ice cubes
I wanna rub 'em on your jumper and your nice shoes
You can rub 'em on my shirt and my tie too
But you should tighten up my belt 'cause it's quite loose
I wouldn’t want my pants to come undone
'Cause then we’d start havin' fun, and that defeats the points of

Dry sex, we ain't gotta take our clothes off yet
We can leave our pants on and just rub and hug
And maybe roll on the ground
