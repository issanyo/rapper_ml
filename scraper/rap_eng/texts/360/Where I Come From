[Verse 1: Iron Solomon]
My grandfather Solomon was wiser than the norm
Never met him 'cause he died before I was ever born
But then my father in his honour dubbed me with his name
His legacy remains and his blood is in my veins
They said when I was born you could feel it in the room
Oversee the baby boy get delivered from the womb
With the ghosts of all the poets and the killers and the goons
And the souls of fallen soldiers who were buildin' the platoon
Breathing life into my lungs like air in a balloon
So they can see me rise above from the ceiling to the moon
So that when I'm dead and gone and I'm buried in a tomb
Then my music can live on and my spirit will resume
So I'm delivering my own recital, influenced by all my idols
Singing every note as Michael, spitting like I wrote the bible
Swinging like I hold the title, hitting like I'm homicidal
Kicking like a loaded rifle, this shit is the older cycle

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in

[Verse 2: Okwerdz]
Yo, where I come from it's a short line of workaholics
So at birth I already earned a lifetimes worth of knowledge
Where I come from who you party with the night before
Could get murdered by the morn', by the time you wake up, life is short
Where I come from wasn't always so supportive
Years of touring, lots of torment, had to build up my endurance
But now I'm with my fans throwing deuces for the pigs
Got a hold of my dream and I ain't loosenin' my grip
Nah, no matter what gets up in my way
Lost a few fake fans from decisions that I made
But most of them wouldn't even admit it to my face
So I don't believe the love and I don't listen to the hate
I'm just doin' me, I know exactly where I came from
The [?] page were champions or made up
And I don't need no bandwagon fuckin' fans
So if I lose you along the way I completely understand, goodbye

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo
Yo, where I come from we started playin' sell out shows
Now these narrow-minded fools think we sellouts though
I might not always rap on hip-hop beats
But guarantee I'll be all up in that kids top three (it's true)
Yeah, I ain't scared of the rise and the fall (nah)
Frankly I'm more afraid of the height of it all
And in my mind I am fightin' a brawl
Reading off invisible ink that you might find me writing on walls
Listen, I am way up here (yeah)
And fuck the negativity you bringin', I'ma stay up here (yeah)
When I dropped "The Take Off" things started to take off
But no way I'll ever be forgettin' where I came from (uh)
I see success in dudes gettin' their hate on
I'd be selling out to make songs for what they want
And understand we all chasin' the same dream
Reppin' on the same team, all of us the same breed

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
You know my grind came for dollar after dollar, boy, we gets it in
That life could turn kids to men, woman dope needle prick the skin
Barrels on a plate can spin, real niggas that twist ya brim
Church go and switch the sin, no confusion, we gets it in
[?] with mamas that visit [?] in Michigan
Settle beef in advance, wear the pants with the pistol in
My close circle move in silence, that's why we whisperin'
Make no mistake about it, get outed and see we gets it in
