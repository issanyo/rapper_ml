[Verse 1: 360]
Hi, could you spare some change?
I've been living at these stairs for days
Days like this I can barely take it
'Cause people don't really seem to care today, shit
And they're afraid 'cause I talk to myself
I wish I didn't have to, I talk 'cause it helps
Any time that it's silent and my mind's still
I hear the screams from the people that I've killed

[Chorus 1: Lisa Mitchell (Sampled)]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a house on a hill and a bed for three?
Oh, do you have a story? Do you have a story for me?
Do you know the one where we all live happily?

[Verse 2: 360]
Tell me, what's it like for you to judge me?
You cross the road, does it frighten you to touch me?
It's funny that you can go from fighting for you country
To getting locked away for fighting 'cause you're hungry
When I get money I get high 'cause I'm a junkie
I never used to do it, but I like it 'cause it numbs me
I've barely made four dollars
But I'd appreicate your help because I wanna escape

[Chorus 2: Lisa Mitchell (Sampled)]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen

[Verse 3: 360]
Ayo, I take a lot of shit 'cause I need to
It helps me to forget it all, so gimme the needle
And honestly I've killed a lot of innocent people
Sent by a country where that shit is illegal
And if you kill in your country it's no way
But if you do it for you country it's suddenly okay
I would end it, but I never follow it through
So maybe spare some money, just a dollar will do
Thank you

[Chorus 2 (Extended): Lisa Mitchell (Sampled)]
Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen

[Outro: Lisa Mitchell (Sampled)]
Do you, do you
Do you, do you
