[Intro: 360]
Uh, yeah, Forthwrite
60
P Easy, Please Be seated
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
I feel that something inside
Right when you feel there was nothing inside
I know now that it's somethin' this time
Now I feel ready, I got nothing to hide
Yo, it's funny things come when you least expect it
Right when you're just about to reach the exit
And now you're hoping that these people get this
And those who admire will at least respect it
See, a lotta wanna watch you fall
Why the hell they wanna stop you for? You don't have to though
They wanna see you drop the ball
Now they got you thinkin' "What's it for?" It doesn't matter though
I write while inside I bleed
Got a hang on every word that your timeline reads
'Cause I'm cool with the life I lead
If you wanna follow suit, yo, it's fine by me

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
Feel like a star [?]
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Yeah, yeah [?]
I was focused on my destination
While thinking "I can get there!" with an exclamation
[?] all my first attempts to make it
Were just clouded by hesitation
Had to sit down thinkin', find my style
Couldn't fix that quick, had to bide my time, this time I
Won't let that bit of me talk negative
To ensure I never repeat that lesson
Now I won't wait, no way, gotta make my own way
Sometime soon or it's done, I'm through with it
Shit, I'm too close to the finish
To burn out, turn 'round and pack up, are you kidding?
I won't let that happen, no chance, won't even
Think of backtrackin', nah, there's just no time
And I prove it, I can free the ghost in me
I think it's time I start living where I'm sposed to be
Thank god

[Chorus: Styalz Fuego]
Feel like a star [?]
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside

[Chorus (Extended): Styalz Fuego & James Mercer (Sampled)]
Was it all for show?
Feel like a star [?]
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside
Feel like a star [?]
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside
