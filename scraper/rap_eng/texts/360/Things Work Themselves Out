[Intro: PEZ]
Uh, uh
Yeah
Forthwrite

[Collision: Oso]
I pray another day
I try to make a stance

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, I focus my energy to capture your mind (mind)
Force you into a feeling you don’t have to define
It builds up, your sensors try to map the design
And find out that they're too happy to find

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Just like your passion inside gets retracted by the facets of life
It disappears, so you're left with this feeling that isn't clear
It appears, interferes into fear
And destroy your foresight, your voice is more like
A force in the wrong direction, first you want progression
But get caught in the thought of it, now you want possessions
I speak out on how it's found in the lesson
That even things you care about will wear you down if you let 'em
It's like that

[Verse 3: 360]
And honestly, we've got the policy knee deep
For me, I think equality's a quality we need
To see more of and stop runnin' away
And prepare your whole life for another day

[Chorus: Oso]
I pray another day, the way things sort themselves out
I try to make a stance but shit don't seem to turn out
I've seen these streets fall red
From black to brown that burns my town
I’ve sold this kind of ground, so drip some down
But if I was a city

[Verse 4: PEZ]
I've always had a vision of a different way to go
I know you're thinkin' that there isn't but I think it may be so
I'm on my own on the road less traveled
But I know this battle I can win 'cause I'm in
Too deep now to think any other way about it
I know I must fill myself with trust, still
I'm feeling sucked still, trying to get some motion
But emotions seem to get in the way, every day

[Verse 5: 360]
We accept change to get in a better headspace
Press play and never forget the next day
Can bring something new, yo, it's up to you
To live life till you're comfortable
And if you dislike somethin', we ain't lobbyin' against it
I'd rather just ignore it than flood it with detention
But if your whole life is flooded with some tension
Then maybe you should sit back and flood it with a question

[Chorus: Oso]
I pray another day, the way things sort themselves out
I try to make a stance but shit don't seem to turn out
I've seen these streets fall red
From black to brown that burns my town
I've sold this kind of ground, so drip some down
But if I was a city
