[Verse 1:]
Here's someone I'd like you to meet â€“ rock bottom
You can hide it sometimes, today is not an option
You want to tell your friends, and you wanna spit it out
It's pretty hard to do, you'd hate to think you'd bring 'em down
But even though you'd want 'em to if they were in need of you
Even though the front is hard to hold, it's still easier
And every day it shows its face, you're getting killed inside
It's so twisted, it's the thing that makes you feel alive
So you can't leave it, it's like you half need it
That inner demon, it makes you want to quit believing
I know how you feel and really, oh, I know it's true
'Cause, honestly, that's exactly what I'm going through

[Hook:]
My wings are broken
My wings are broken

[Verse 2:]
You're in the eye of the storm
Should be glad in a way, that's where lightning is formed
All these clouds that surrounded around you, fighting a war
You've seen this violence before, but you don't know what you're fighting it for
It's so hard to let your heart embrace it
You see it's hard to take it, it's getting larger and you can't escape it
It's like you can't uncover this grey cloud on you
So you sit there, hoping it rains down on you
It'll swallow you whole. You know that that's standard
You see the ground, but it's bound to be a crash landing
You need to be here now, you always go within
You want to touch down, it's hard to do with broken wings
It's like your hearts pain is everything you can't take
Forget about your past days, remember that our scars fade
I know how you feel, talking 'bout it won't do
But you'll be fine that's exactly what I'm going through

[Hook:]
My wings are broken
My wings are broken
