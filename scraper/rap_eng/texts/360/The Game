"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Like—like—like—like—like" "I get busy"
"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Our music"

[Verse 1: Pez]
Check, check, yeah
Now when I look I see a lot of rappers around
Some old and some young, tryna hold up a front
So under it I'm wonderin' what they must think
You just spat a whole verse and didn't say one thing
If you wanna talk about your lyrics then I wanna say this openly
No-one anywhere from here is really comin' close to me
It ain't a joke, we both know that I'm a dope MC
Who the fuck are you supposed to be? You're nobody
I don't believe you really are who you appear to be
I can clearly see, you don't look real to me
You think I really care if you're not feeling me?
All that's telling me is that you're really not hearing me
Maybe open your ears, have a listen
Instead of being set of indebters and trying to diss it, bitches

[Verse 2: 360]
Fuck yeah!
Ayo, you nice to my face, then you hate me? Damn, bitch
You're fuckin' lucky you can shake my hand, shit
Now you tough, you gon' make a stand?
Switch up your whole style and go and make a sand—wich
With hip-hop, I didn't make a plan
I just rocked up lookin' like a ladies man
And in one fuckin' night we can make a grand
Let me support your show when we take your fans, damn
I get pissed off reading these magazines (yep)
They're as shit as the Australian battle scene (fuck)
A bunch of nobodies living in their faggot dream
Bring your mates so you're guaranteed to have a win
Yeah, that's right, I rhymed "win" with "dream"
There's whack and there's terrible, you're in-between
I'll be chilling in a limousine listening to "Billie Jean"
Skippin' a show so I can head to the Philippines
