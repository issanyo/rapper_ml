[Intro: 360 & PEZ]
Ha ha, yeah
Uh, 360 and PEZ
Forthwrite
You know we rap on that disco shit
Yeah, believe that, believe that
Ah, yeah, yeah (Believe it)
I don't know if you guys are ready for this shit (Probably not)
But it's fuckin' on

[Hook: Simon Lord]
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
It's the same old song that I always sing each year

[Ad-libs: PEZ]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Let's start this shit
PEZ, uh

[Verse 1: PEZ]
Now, I got so much belief in myself it's crazy
Yo, I'll tell you this and you will probably think that I'm crazy
I believe I got a job working down at the bakery
So the baker down the road comes and actually pays me
I can feel like I'm drunk and already at a nightclub
When I'm out the front and they won't even let me line up
Shit, I believe that I got flown to the moon
When I was really sitting here all alone in my room
Yeah, the point I'm makin' is it really doesn’t happen (nah)
It's like right now, I'm not really fuckin' rappin' (nah)
You believe I am, so that really doesn't matter
See you listen to this verse, think you hear me and you're happy Yeah, I believe in believing itself
Ask Seth and 360, they believe it as well
And you know I got so much belief in myself
That even when I need help, I don’t need any help

[Hook: Simon Lord]
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
It's the same old song that I always sing each year

[Verse 2: 360]
All right, let me just say I love belief
Uh, that shit's a front for me
Man, I don't believe (why?), I have no belief (oh)
Everything I set my mind to, I won't achieve
Ask my dad, everything I believed in
Always seems to fail every time with no reason
And every night I dream of my own passion
My only belief is believing it won't happen
I didn't try when I started high school
Mind was empty, everybody's glass was half-full
My English teacher was Mrs McGee
Everything that she teached us I didn't believe (like English)
And I went to call her out when I was givin' a speech
But nobody believes that they should listen to me
And I like to play sports but basketball's hard
Instead of trying to win games, I'd rather not start (uh)
And if I get a wife, I bet that she'll leave me
And even though I don't, yo, you better believe me

[Hook: Simon Lord]
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
I believe you can be
What I need to believe
