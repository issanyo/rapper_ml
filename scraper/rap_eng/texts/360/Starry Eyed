[Intro: Ellie Goulding (Sampled)]
Starry-eyed

[Hook: Ellie Goulding (Sampled)]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, this music shit's a funny game, where people talk and yo
It doesn't change, yo, I feel like walking 'cause it's fucking lame
And I ain't met this bird, she acting like she sorta knew me
'Cause it's a gig, yo, I'ma treat her like some sorta groupie
She got her guard up, something that she has to do
See I understand though, I guess that's what us rappers do
Yo, it's a fact, it's true, go ahead and judge my moves
I'll be honest though, I sometimes do, see
The more you do it though, the more you're gonna need of it
It's all your ego and all it does is feed off it
You find a girl to say your goodnight to
Then say your goodbye's like, "Yeah, I had a good night too"
Peace

[Hook: Ellie Goulding (Sampled)]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, my mother's saying I should find myself a nice girl
Ayo, I'm trying to, it's tough to live in my world
Especially if I'm to meet them at a gig
'Cause what's meaningful to them is always meaningless to him
See they're either up for anything or definetly scared off
Or things boring, the infatuation wares off
'Cause in a second they be offering you sex
'Cause of your rep, I ain't expectin' you to get it just respect it
But see it ain't about sexin' 'em all
Most the times I can't see it being anything more
But see I love it and I hate, let the lesson be told
But if I'm only known as 60 I ain't gettin' involved, no

[Hook: Ellie Goulding (Sampled)]
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding (Sampled)]
Lightning
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
