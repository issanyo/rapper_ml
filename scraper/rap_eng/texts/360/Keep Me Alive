[Verse 1: 360]
We might have lost control
See the writing's on the wall
See 'em all try to hide it from us all
But we might've lost it all
And we need to see the light
I see all the people read the signs
Don't know how to read between the lines
We gotta heal this planet
That's the way that I feel about it
It seems that we're gonna kill it now
But how you expecting to live without it?
Some say we're in code red
Some say they're thinking that it can't stop
I don't think that it might go wrong
At this rate I'm thinking that it can't not

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive

[Verse 2: 360]
It—it ain't about global warming
That—that ain't the only warning (warning)
It's about the road we on
We gotta figure out what's most important
It ain't about a total score and
It ain't about us owning more things
If only we could go beyond our overall
I wonder when we might realise
Stop believing these real lies
At this rate that we kill and we fight
I'm wondering, "will we survive?"
See? This is the scene of the crime
We need to be bleeding it dry
Where evil is winning and people
Are dying and pleading to keep me alive

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive

[Bridge: 360]
Yo, I'm thinking it's time we left
'Cause not much time is left
And I don't want to die just yet
'Cause I know a lot of life is left
And I'm needing to find my breath
Right now, we're reaching the final steps
Soon enough, you're going to find me dead
With no one taking the time of death

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
