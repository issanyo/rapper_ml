[Verse 1: 360]
To succeed is what we dream of
They say we can't, that's what we feed of, yeah
And while you see floors, this shit's about to blow without the C4
Because we're never content, because we need more
Climbing these walls to the top and leap off
Don't respond to those who doubt us, we just keep on
No guts, no glory, no buts, it's so boring
For us there's no corners, if we want it we go for it
I can feel the sky, flying pass really high
Having freedom is the only way we feel alive
Warriors and rebels make it through
For the unity and victory we're dedicated to
It doesn't matter if they slept on us
The crowds are forming for us, head on up
Ain't no stopping it, best of luck
I'd like to welcome you to Defqon.1

[Verse 2: 360]
All aboard, this is easy, for real
We don't think that we can, we believe that we will
So come on, let's do this shit that people only dream about
Forget the fast lane, we're gonna take the scenic route
All it takes is belief, so we will make 'em believe
That they can achieve and have the things their brains can perceive
We're giving you the best of us
I'd like to welcome you to Defqon.1
