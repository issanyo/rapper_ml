[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, listen
I ain't the type that'd ever choose lovemaking
But with you though it's something that I love making
And when we do I don't feel the need to fuck around
'Cause the sex is so good and I love it now
I been partying for days, baby, come around
'Cause the sex is my wings while I'm coming down
I'm prepared to do whatever you want
Give you everything of me, but the neck is the spot
I start at, move south as I head to the spot
With the muscle in my mouth, I'm connecting the dots
Yeah, hip grinding, lip biting, ignited
I'm feeling like I'm in flight inside ya
I can't finish first, that ain't never fair (Yeah)
Let me make you win, 'cause that respect is there
And if you ain't the type that'll climax
I promise I'll do anything to get you there, yeah

[Chorus: James Blake (Sampled)]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in

[Verse 2: 360]
It's the love that we're making
And when it's heated I honestly won't leave you marks
(Nah) And if we're doing our thing and then I grab on your neck
Ayo, I promise I won't squeeze too hard
See it started with the sex, only getting off
But now I can't really tell if this is sex or not
I know I haven't asked you at all
But can you feel what I feel? Are you starting to fall?
Listen, I ain't saying that I love you
And I ain't worrying at all if you don't love me
But I ain't saying I don't trust you
It's just that where I'm at in my life, yo, I don't trust me
Yeah, I'm unsteady, wasn't ready for this right now
I feel heavy, I'm stressing, ain't ready to be tied down
Like G said, I might be overanalysing
But I'm so over analysing

[Chorus 2: James Blake (Sampled)]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
[?]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in
