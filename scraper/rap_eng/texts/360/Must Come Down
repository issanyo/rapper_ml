[Verse 1: 360]
The only muscle that I'm working out is beating in my chest
So every time it bleeds , it is feeding me some strength
I swear that I'll wear it on my sleeve until I'm dead;
That I hold it in my hands, when I need a BPM
My closets full of skeletons I'm eager to forget
It’s time for them to leave, so I need to get them dressed
I try to ignore the demons in my head
I won't speak to them again
But at the same time, they keeping me in check
I'm grateful that I figured out the secret to success
Now any goal I’ve wanted, I’m believing I can get
If I keep my head clear while competing with the best
With my eyes on the target, then my feet will do the rest
Stay humble to my fans and the people that I've met
'Cause arrogant motherfuckers are easy to forget
And I'm thinking I should strive to be addicted to sobriety
And try to make the most of this gift that is inside of me

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Searching for some happiness and went got it
Feeling on the verge of having anything that I ever wanted
To be honest, it’s weird cause when you living in a life
That’s so surreal and sometimes it’s hard to know who's real, for real. Still
It’s my life I’m not giving it away
I’m sure these people hanging around who I can’t trust, but fuck it, Let's toast of success
Celebrate it;  couple more fucking faded
I could stay here all night hoping to get a little bit more high
Off a payment that all came
From having a bit of foresight
And I’m just trying to make my way through all that ego
Haters taking shots, you stave them off and then they reload
No point trippin’ off of people that I never met
Finally realising that this life I got is Heaven sent
With opportunities a lot of people never get
It’s gone by so fast and I'm just trying to keep a level head
Yeah

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
