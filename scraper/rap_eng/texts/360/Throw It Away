[Verse 1: 360]
Hey yo, money makes the world go 'round, we know that
Is it gonna change your life if you own that?
Is it gonna have you high in the sky where you're so glad
Will it just define what you're known as?
While I'm wishing that I had a mint
I'd share it round if I had some riches
See with money though yo it can't bring us happiness
But it will bring the things we'd be happy with (indeed)
While the homeless are begging for some change
There are some who are begging for a change
You disagree, start begging for a change
We need change but everything's the same
I can't be another one running in a rat race
Living in a life where it's all about the cash mate
So forgive me, I'm a go and practice me
'Cause I feel like that's for me so...

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't want to know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't want to go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo meet generation yes, we party so much
Got our folks worried that our hearts will blow up
It's funny that we can't say no but
I hope we don't hit it too hard and go nuts
Yo, we will know in time
Man this shit that kills us is why we all feel so alive
And get paid on Friday from working all week then
Forget it all by blowing it on the weekend
And some will say 60 is a fool
The kid's a beginner because he didn't finish school
Yo it wasn't for me mate
Working in the office on weekdays is not what I'll be mate
It ain't 'cause I'm broke that I'm wanting to seek change
I'm a treat this like my job and I'll see pay
So forgive me, maybe it's my lack of sleep
But I feel like I have to dream so

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

[Bridge: 360]
Hey yo I can't be one of them dudes no more
I ain't gonna be wearing them shoes no more
Won't waste time all for the loot no more
With no idea what I can use it for
Yeah, yo I don't wanna work 'til I'm fifty
And then spent what I've earn't 'til I'm sixty
So forgive me, I know it's got a hold on me
But no way is it controlling me, no

[Hook: Josh Pyke]
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away
I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away
