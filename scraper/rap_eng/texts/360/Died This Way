[Verse 1: Bam Bam]
Yeah, ah shit, six, we fuckin' running it now
Bam Bam, remember the name, suck it down
Yeah, I came to be famous and take the place of your favourites
While all these ignoramuses came here to fuck around
I'm amazin', but I'ma save it for y'all to say
And get 'em wasted, but I'm embracin' it all the same
And if you hate it, you probably take it straight in the anus
Ain't no way that I'm changin' it, babe, I was born this way

[Interlude: 360]
I'll take a bottle of Lanolin, squirt it in your fucking eye
And make you cry them dry moist tears
That you've been waiting to hold onto for years
You fucking soft cunt, I don't give a fuck!
Pots are probably your favourite type of material
Because you like flowers, you fucking pussy
I fucking hate you
Ketamine!
We don't give a...

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, if money grew on trees, yo, I'd smoke that shit
If I'm meetin' Mother Nature, I'ma poke that bitch
I'm a creep, but you motherfuckers know that shit
Such a pervert, fuck, even my phone has tits
It's probably for the best that I don't have kids
'Cause if my daughter farted on me, I would choke that bitch
Don't ask me for money 'cause I don't have shit
All I've got on me is this pipe that I smoke crack with

[Verse 3: Bam Bam]
Yeah, Stand The Fuck Up ain't just the name of the mixtape
It's what six says to me after the sixth day
Of a straight bender with no intention of ending it
No sleeping or eating and no sense in our sentences
(Can you pass the doob) We ain't ever giving a flying fuck
Flyin' as high as a kite, wired and fuckin' fired up
But on the off chance that you catchin' us driving drunk
At least it ain't with Ryan Dunn (Too soon?)
We don't give a fuck!

[Verse 4: 360 & Bam Bam]
Yeah, I was driving drunk with Ryan Dunn
But I survived the cunt, look, I'm alive as fuck
Man, you nearly died and I really thought that your time was up
That's why I did a line of drugs as long as his tire marks
I saw you crawlin' and climbin' out from behind the shrubs
Right after your car transformed like Shia LeBeouf's
I know the line was harsh, but we're just rhymin' bars
And if you analyse it, fuck it, yo, it's kind of smart

[Verse 5: Bam Bam]
Forever speeding, I'm always leadin' the fast life
Hard crime, doin' a bag of coke just to pass time
I'm still going from last night and it's half past nine
In the morning, I'm pourin' a glass of this cask wine
I really need to get home, yo, but I can't drive
Last time that I tried it, I passed out in the car twice
I've got to make it, I got a lady that's waitin'
A hot little-waisted Asian chick, but her titties are half white

[Verse 6: 360]
I ain't caring what you think, fuckhead
'Cause your girl's looking at me thinkin', "Six, fuck yes"
She told me what she wanted, yo, we discussed it
And everything she said has left me disgusted
If you believe in God then I think you're a faggot
I wrote the Bible, I was trippin' on acid
Understand, motherfucker, I am six foot four
And with a line of coke I am six foot more
We don't give a fuck!
