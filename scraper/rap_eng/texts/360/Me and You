[Chorus (Sampled): Alana Stephens]
Are you ready, do you know
I feel it too
Are you ready, I got to show
I feel this for you
I feel this for you
I feel this for you
I feel this for you

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah
Hi, I'm from the Generation Y
See they really wanna label us and separate us, why?
Look me in my eyes, we in a better place in time
And fuck what they be thinkin', I'ma never change my mind
Yeah, hear me out, I think livin' in this country's great
But there's a few things this government should fuckin' change
To our soldiers, man, lest we forget 'em
How the fuck are we still warin' when it's twenty-eleven?
Wrong, we move forward, but take steps backwards
Like those of us who don't believe in same sex marriage
Yeah, this is the modern day segregation
See, I defend and praise 'em, I could give a fuck if you resent and hate them
So if you with me on this track then throw your ones up
And if you racist in this age then grow the fuck up
I'm being real 'cause that's how we do it son
We representin' one race motherfucker, the human one

[Bridge (Sampled): Alana Stephens]
Oh yeah
Me and you

[Pre-Verse: Tys]
When you hear this
It's gonna make [?] stop
All I really wanna see is
A little piece of me inside your mind
When you hear this
It's gonna make [?] stop
All I really wanna see is
A little piece of me inside your mind
When you hear this
It's gonna make [?] stop
All I really wanna see is
A little piece of me inside ya, uh (Come on!)

[Verse 2: Tys]
I play this game, I can see you're tryna break me down
And kill me to fill me with all your hatred and your pain
You ain't gonna take me out, can't throw me or slow me down
Nah, you must me crazy to be thinking I'd let you manipulate me
So come on, I won't give up
You've tried for so long, but they go on 'cause you're not strong enough (Yeah)
Now that's life, pick any one reason if that gives you reason to fight
And stay alive and maybe in time you will find what you seek in this life

[Chorus (Sampled): Alana Stephens]
Are you ready, do you know
I feel it too
Are you ready, I got to show
I feel this for you
I feel this for you
I feel this for you
I feel this for you
