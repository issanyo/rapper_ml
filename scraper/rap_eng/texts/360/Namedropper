[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm mentionin' names, someone will be coppin' some flak
And, like Debris' arsehole, I will be coppin' some Flak (ha ha)
You're honestly wack, you about to get smacked mate
To top it off, he's AKA, he's fuckin' Fat Face
And put the mic in the sack
You sound like a fifty-year-old bikie trying to rap (yeah, yeah)
Enough of that shit, let's see who's next
A fuckin' retard who calls himself Fubex (faggot)
Anymore and I'm smackin' this feather
Someone tell this cunt to go back to Eurella
No matter how hard you try, you're pitiful g
When I say you're spittin' to me, I mean it literally
I grab both my hands for this crew 2Up
And pick two fingers because your fuckin' crew sucks
Talkin' about how you hate corners
When you dress and look like some reject bloody skateboarders
And now I'm dissin' you cats
Let me bring out this dickhead who's thinking he's black
And I'm about to let you know about a thug rapper
I'm talkin' 'bout this Judge fella, he's a fuckin' grudge [?]
You see your face in the news [?]
That's too bad, white kids ain't supposed to wear Doorags
When you rhyme, you should cover your mouth you slob
You wanna-be-50 Cent, jockin' how to rob

[Verse 2]
Now I'm dissin' these dudes, Suffa and Pressure and shit
The Hilltop Hoods, they can suck and just press on my dick
These guys suck cock, they named their album The Calling
Because they're getting called to fuck off
And I've got the better style
Reason loves his job at teaching because he's a fuckin' peadophile
This dude thinks he raps original
I know for a fact he told dudes he was aboriginal
I'm not being racist so listen through
He's not aboriginal, his fuckin' kid's a Jew
You're dead kid, you better believe it bitch
I'll leave you headless just like your penis is
Yeah, I diss this maggot, he's gonna get flopped away
Don't cry pussy, go to a fuckin' mosque and pray
Stop sooking you little bitch
And maybe you could get Little Mick to touch your little dick
I'm talkin' about Unknown, you little whore kid
You know that faggot you get to sing your chorus?
You thought no one would ever rebel
But your music video was just pathetic as hell
And you're a nerd, just listen
I use words of wisdom while you practice the art of circumcision
And you'll forever be shit
And maybe quit rapping and stick to sucking Pegasus' dick
