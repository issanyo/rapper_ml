[Round 1: Justice]
I'm gonna take everyone back to Scribble in '05
I went into that shit with like little to no lines
I came up against The Saurus and shit on him both times
Now he's got a vendetta and he's bitter with no pride
I seen the evolution of The Saurus, you going from A to A
The way you rapped five years ago, you rap the same today
And after I beat you in '05 and gave you a pat on the back
I caught him back stage crying in Illmaculate's lap

[360]
Who the fuck brought Newman from Seinfeld?
You know you're fat when you can use a hula hoop as a tight belt
And you two look like some [?] right now
Why the fuck are you even hear you should be moving some guy's couch

[Justice]
If you got to your nearest library and walk and around and look
You'll find Madness and The Saurus, I ain't talking 'bout the book
Look, this is not the natural path that evolution takes
Freddy Krueger's face, seven human's waists

[360]
If you think that Kramer's harsh, '60 can get racist hard
But I won't come with race remarks cause I can't tell what race you are

[Round 1: Madness]
Alright, so like 360 is like, "I can't tell what race you are."
I can't tell your either but I know living with AIDS is hard

[The Saurus]
I just wanna wonder how long you pre-rehearsed
Cause I've rapped the same since '05 and you rap even worse
Yo Decoy said we battled the best team on the entire circuit
So for the last month I've been writing verses for Prime and Purpose
This dude is a bitch
You look exactly like this one rapper who used to exist
Won Scribble, had one shot at a future and missed

[Madness]
You little prick
And you're just a faggot
You think you can really see a team of The Saurus and Madness?
Y'all probably live action role play the whole day, think you can transform into dragons
And porn has good acting

[The Saurus]
Us losing doesn't normally happen so I hope you're preparing to die
When I won Scribble after you I thought we'd be on a path to parallel lives
Come to find out, no one in this own country cares for this guy
Cause he apparently tries to rap so Americanized

[Round 2: Justice]
Before The Saurus said, "Why'd you retire, you ain't been battling in years?"
That means you think battling is an actual career
What a dickhead, the biggest faggot that you'll hear of
His daughter's first words were, "Daddy get a real job."

[360]
You just made it clear that your appetite is great
It must fucking suck having that apple pie face
Aye Saurus, maybe next year when it's Valentine's Day
Don't give your missus a card full of battle rhymes, eh

[Justice]
How'd your mother give birth to a man of Snuffleupagus girth?
The pussy would've stretched so wide it would've covered the Earth
For real you can fit a man in a truck inside of Madness's gut
And still have room to fit in a fucking passenger bus
And Jabba The Hut

[Round 2: Madness]
He wants to talk about how my mother gave birth to me
Let me explain you in a better way
You look so fucking young you give a new meaning to the term 'born yesterday'
And you are both shit to me
You've been gone so long you probably still say "lyrically"
I kill MC's, especially two that moonlight as Jim A and Mr. G
From Summer Heights
Yeah I see that you fucking right
And you probably bone your mum at night cause you live that Bad Boy bubby life

[The Saurus]
We battled five years ago but somehow you look like even less of a youngin
So I'm guessing that Justice's government name is Benjamin Button
And you faggots don't got a chance against an American made missile
You knew you'd get raped that's why you're wearing a rape whistle

[Madness]
360's interests are hair with the frostiest tips
Surf boards with the awesomest grips
You are both honestly shit
And let me reiterate, you don't want it with this

[Round 3: Justice]
I am Benjamin Button with the cycle that I'm aging
So when I'm 50 I'll fuck your daughter at her high school graduation
Yo, I'm half Chinese but I'm questioning my religion
Cause I can't tell if Buddah is Mexican or Sicilian

[360]
Yo, he likes to masturbate over beautiful large men
And he gets teary when he thinks of food in the past tense
And he reminds me of the little boy from 2 And A Half Men
Which is ironic cause he looks like two and a half men
Me and your fucking girlfriend we had a great affair
I had her laying there [?] Australian [?]

[Justice]
And fuck what you think you ain't the world rap champ
You a nerd rap fag like Dirtbag Dan

[Round 3: The Saurus]
I'm the world rap champ and this faggot never made it there
The only great affair you ever had was with his facial hair
I spit the great rap schemes
I'm just wondering, do those gay ass jeans come with an AIDS vaccine?
Hold up, there's some shit that needs an explanation
In WRC he was on a different team but were quick to leave and left him hanging
360's not a perfect circle so this would be the best equation
Minus 50 G's, Kevin Bacon needed Six Degrees Of Separation

[Madness]
And I'm just wondering
When you sold out and made the festival song
Did the contract say one of the requirements was to have your testicles gone

[The Saurus]
When you went to the prom I had sex with your mom listening to 'Let's Get It On'

[Madness]
Listen, Antedote was the first face that I seen and then you were next out of my window seat
[?] hiding in your hairline, cause I bet I could skydive off of your fucking widow's peek

{Judges call for overtime}

[OT Round 4: Madness]
This cunt got his name because he wanted to change his living habits
So he took his life and did a 360, and yep, still a faggot
Yo, Dirt' was right you do look like that Microsoft Word paperclip
That ass shit
And I put a million stacks bitch that you got a herpe covered little ass dick

[The Saurus]
Yo, I guess today you came to be ruined
Don't be mad at me cause I made a living off of something you're afraid to keep doing
He said he'd fuck my daughter but the closest he gets to fucking women
Is when he's watching '60 in front of the mirror trying to tuck his dick in
Yo, and I know this motherfucker's a Stan
Cause he said, "I'm never washing this again" after touching my hand
I don't need none of my punches to land
Cause they're so skinny, these cunts couldn't stand in front of a fan

[Madness]
Now listen, listen, I will rape both of you broads until my cock's red
You teaming with Antedote looked like Gumby reuniting with one of the blockheads
Ayo, and I will fucking begin to start the murder
Better yet, you look like the reuniting of shark and surfer

[OT Round: 360]
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, blazing these fucking haters
He raps with a chip on his shoulder, in case he gets hungry later
Yo this faggot's a bit lost, I know why Madness is pissed off
Cause he can't figure out how to eat the SPAM in his in-box

[Justice]
Listen, this guy is massive on Youtube, not cause he's hardcore bitch
You are massive on Youtube cause it's the Star Wars kid
Check it out, I don't even give a shit about you I don't know what your name is
But I've known him for ages, it's Toady from Neighbors

[360]
Aye, this fat fuck would probably break a sweat at a game of chess
I'm surprised he doesn't take a step and break a leg
I will bust in your home and kidnap your daughter and shave her head
And play classical music while I powder lips and paint 'em red

[Justice]
These motherfuckers are both Greek and Italian
So don't expect shit to come from each of their albums
Cause the only decent epiphany to come from Greece or from Italy
Is that [?], Euripides and fucking pizza delivery
