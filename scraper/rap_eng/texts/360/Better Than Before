[Verse 1]
Now I’m stealin’ beats from my favourite Canadian cat
So I could hit him with Australian raps, now I’m taking it back
To make payments with no paper or cash
Every word I spit is truth without stating the facts
My statement is that no one not once taking me back
If there’s hate in what you’re sayin’ then my name isn’t Matt
‘Cause I’m waitin’ very patient till my name’s in [?]
And there’s no excuse for hate, so go on take it on back
And yo, I’m thankful (For what?) Yo, I’m thankful for that
Thankful for every question that you bank on a [?]
Hopin’ that he might stumble, fallin’ flat on his back
And so polite, most the times no one’s thankin’ him back
It’s that socialite, a certain few are hopin’ he dies
But hoping is inaction so they know he’ll survive
He’s grown to his height, regardless, you still know that he’ll rise
And realise you’ll always see him if you open your eyes

[Chorus]
I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road
Crooked footsteps underway
Never knowin' where to go
No realness, all a dream
Starin’ at my life below
Hope my life’ll form a trail
To get where I wanna go, I don’t understand

[Verse 2]
You have doubts believin’ you’ll be somethin’
But doubts are your enemy, lead you to see nothin’
You can’t help it, you’re eager to see somethin’
You’re seein’ your dream stuck and you’re needin’ the freedom to be
One with yourself and you’re runin’ through hell
Lived a life of others, never fell in love with himself
And that’s what’s needed to ever be completed and knowin’ what’s true
Always defeated ‘cause you never will focus on you
And yo, it’s good to be compassionate
But give yourself an itch or somethin’ or your spirit takes some damagin’
There’s no accidents, just fate and destiny too
So why have a million friends and one enemy – you
And I can tell you callin’ for help
You gotta try and work it out and maybe call on yourself
And put down the shield and maybe talk to yourself
That’s your main biggest problem, you’re at war with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
In your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before
And in your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before

[Chorus]
I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road
Crooked footsteps underway
Never knowin' where to go
No realness, all a dream
Starin’ at my life below
Hope my life’ll form a trail
To get where I wanna go, I don’t understand
