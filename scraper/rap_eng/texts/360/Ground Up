[Intro: 360 & PEZ]
Motherfucker (ha ha ha)
Da da da da (yeah)
Da da da (Forthwrite)
(For my homie Gs) Da da da (PEZ, 360)
Da da da (Ground Up)
Da da da da (PEZ, uh)
Da da da (yeah, yeah)
(Three-siddy motherfuckers) Da da da (okay)
Yo

[Verse 1: PEZ]
Write my words at a show 'cause they're perfect to quote
All I need is bourbon and coke and my verse will be dope
I got that averb mercellous and murderous flow
I only think that I'm the best because I'm certain, I know
I'm lurkin' but I'm not snatchin' purses for dough
I'm just cold so I'm tryna roll a person for clothes
That's right mate, gimme ya fuckin' shirt and your coat!
You too bitch, go and get me a skirt and a robe!
And I'm always in the water since I purchased my boat
Not the beach, I've got a castle, I just circle my moat
When it comes to ridin' waves though, I'm learnin' the rope
So, to play it safe, I surf on the road
Last week, I found this canister of ooze that had this permanent glow
So I gave it to my turtle 'cause I heard it would grow
I tried to feed it pizza but it turned and said no
And then got injured ribs, fightin' infant kids doing ninja kicks
Plus it couldn't flip
Which means that all the martial art moves in the cartoons were just full of shit
It was hard, I had a little purple ninja turtle
It copped shit because it couldn't even spin in circles
Yo, today I bought myself a punching bag
I tried to hit it but it dodged and started punching back
After one attack, it went and grabbed a club and bat
And then, all just for fun, it smacked my back until my lungs collapsed
And, growin' up, I gotta say my mum was slack
She used to sleep in and never had our lunches packed
To keep it under wrap, she used to feed us tonnes of crap
Every single meal of every day I ate was something fat
My mates told me go to Macca's 'cause the buns were flat
Still I only ate my burgers down at Hungry Jack's
It wasn't personal, was all because my tongue was hacked
Off so I had no taste buds and had to trust the ads (the burgers are better at Hungry Jack's)

[Chorus: 360]
They're those dudes you hate (ha ha, yeah)
Who you wanna kill (yeah)
You might hate our sound (fuck yeah)
But can't deny our skill (that's right dickhead)
Those dudes you hate (word up, Ground Up)
And they're paid to love (uh, it's 360)
If you wanna (cover your mother)
You might never see us alive again

[Verse 2: 360]
People say my image is wrong
I'm kickin' writtens while I'm sittin' in thongs
I'm sippin' Crisp with your missus while you're rippin' a bong
And I heard you called me wack when I was spittin' a song
Cool, that's your opinion but your opinion is wrong
Yo I'm sick of Earth and always hangin' with kids
Because I'm fed up with people like a cannibal is
Bitch, I'm that rich, I mack chicks for a day job
And Brad Pitt's my brother, yo, we came from the same box
Yeah, I was made hot, I've got a license to steal
So I'm finna get my name swapped to James Bond
I spend hours at a time watchin' Bay Watch
I've got a dirty mind that needs to be brainwashed
And I was workin' full-time at a cake shop
I hate jobs and fake coughs to take the day off
And every day you'll see me sittin' in the same spot
Drinkin' from an empty cup and talkin' to a fake dog (sit)
To write an album, yo, it takes me an hour
If you don't like my shit then I'll be playin' it louder
Plus I'm the best rapper that ever was or ever will be
So, if you want a sense if pride then you better kill me
It doesn't mean 'cause I dress in hammocks and leather jackets
Like Lenny Kravitz that I'm just another trendy faggot
Yo, my balls are stressed and battered
'Cause every night, I'm stayin' up late, trying to have sex with hammers
I'm a member addict, and that means
I'll sign up for every gym, club and team and event you haven't
I'm the furtherest thing from a scumbag
I flew in Louis Vuitton to design me a cum rag
Yo, my life's a porno
And that's how I afford clothes from designer wardrobes
I wouldn't say my shit ain't as tight as yours though
'Cause I'm so fuckin' good I can rhyme in Morse Code
Like "beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, be-beep, bop"

[Outro: 360]
Ha ha ha, yeah, shout out to Steve Zudd (da da da)
Yeah man (da da da)
I've said if before, we're the best rappers here (da da da)
I think it's startin' to sink in
You're startin' to fuckin' realise (da da da da)
Pay respect faggots (da da da)
Get on your knees and wash my fuckin' feet with your hair (da da da)
You know the deal bitches (da da da)
Uh, Forthwrite, takin' over
Ground Up, yup, yup
