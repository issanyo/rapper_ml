[Intro: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, I've done stupid shit that I need to make up for
Your biggest nightmare can be your biggest wake up call
And I'm lucky I ain't still poor this life is what I'd kill for
Thought I got everything off my chest but there's still more
I'd change a lot of shit if I had time again
The price of fame is costin' me the life I crave
I can't believe these girls who wanna fuck me
When they know I got a girlfriend it honestly disgusts me
I bet before the fame they probably would of judged me
If I wasn't 360 then they wouldn't even touch me
All this substance abuse is so disgusting
I get over one thing then another drug gets subbed in
Went from a drunk kid to being a drug pig
Tellin' people that I'm clean, What a fuckwit!
Look at this random chick actin' like she knows me well
I'm sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Verse 2: 360]
Uh, yeah
Now all I want in Australia is a private life
To leave my house and not be seen, I need the right disguise
Sunnies to hide my eye and a scarf to cover the tats
I'm so anxious, fuckin' relax
See me and [Crystal] are done for sure
Stop askin' why is it, yo it's my business and it's none of yours
These little kids were so hopeful about us
I guess it's my fault for being open about it
It was hard for a while but I've moved on dude
But now both her and the public need to move on too
Now word on the street, she fuckin' an MC that I know
A dude I thought was my mate but needless to show
That even though I helped him get a name and feet on the road
I'm happy either way as long as she leaves me alone
Yeah, now look at these kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself

[Chorus: Gary Clark]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

[Bridge: 360]
Look at this random chick actin' like she knows me well
Sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself
Look at these little kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself
Look at this random girl actin' like she knows me well
I'm sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself
Look at these little kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself

[Chorus (Extended): Gary Clark & iK!D]
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, so
Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again
