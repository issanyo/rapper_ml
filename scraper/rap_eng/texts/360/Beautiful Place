[Verse 1]
Yo, yeah
Equality's what's needed, when that honesty stays
I have a feeling we'll be livin' in this wondrous place
In my view we need to make the poverty change
Not just hide it like we did during the Commonwealth Games
Yeah, they got the money, they should give 'em a bed
But you know they'd rather dinners instead
With their infinite endless supply of easy living with cheques
And decorated for our visitors friends to leave 'em impressed
Why the fuck are they deleting the trees?
It ain't a known fact that everybody needs them to breathe?
I gotta say now, why wasn't David Hicks back?
Needed to be at home so he could face this riffraff
Uh, save the chitchat excuses you've made
There's never an excuse for the youth you could save
(Never, never) I know the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' at an infinite day, come on and tell 'em more
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' and you're livin' in a beautiful place

[Verse 2]
Now hear me out, I shouldn't need to repeat
We can all afford words with the freedom of speech
And me, I chase goals, I believe in a dream
And most of all I believe in belief
So I speak to the teens and let 'em know there's hope if you want it
Fight for what you wanted and be openly honestly
And gain profits, I'll be screaming out love to the people
'Cause I'm living in a place where the guns are illegal
(Shot down) I feel cops need to stop the real crimes
Instead of enforcing petty little laws just to kill time (True)
I feel fine 'cause I'm living in the most liveable place
I find it's like an infinite taste
Of what's to come, uh, any day you're under the sun
And any second, yo, the thunder will come
Then I run in to find you all the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' at an infinite day, come on and tell 'em more
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' and you're feelin' like you're livin' in a beautiful place

[Outro]
Melbourne, it's a beautiful place
Victoria, it's a beautiful place
S.A., it's a beautiful place
Australia is a beautiful place
New South Wales, it's a beautiful place
Queensland, it's a beautiful place
Northern Territory, it's a beautiful place
Australia is a beautiful place to live
W.A., Tasmania too (Place to live)
(Yeah, it's a beautiful place to live) A.C.T
And if you didn't know you sure will, sucka
