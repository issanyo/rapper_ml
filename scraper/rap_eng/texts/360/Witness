[Pre-Chorus (Extended)]
I keep tellin' 'em "As God as my witness
Who I'm runnin' with is none of your business"
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
I can't wait until I'm free of ya
I keep tellin' 'em "As God as my witness
I'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness"
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Chorus]
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Verse 1]
I wish my grandpa could see me now
I wonder, would he be disgusted? Would he be proud?
It ain't about the choices that you shouldn't've made
It's about what you did when they couldn't been made
See I'm dancin' with the devil, one foot in the grave
The eyes are windows to your soul, take a look at my pain
It's all about the risks that you lookin' to take
And fuck what anybody says, yo, it's good to be brave
Focus on the positives, don't look at mistakes
I shoulda been a failure if you look at my grades, ayy
Feel that inner zen, in a sense
Innocence is just a lack of inner sense, mmm
I don't rate success in the numbers I am paid
I rate it from people just tellin' me their lives were saved
Wasn't the person the media would try to paint
Haters read the headlines, fans read the entire page

[Pre-Chorus]
"God as my witness
I'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness"
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Chorus (Extended)]
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

[Verse 2]
Yo
There's a monster growin' in me, and I have to feed it
The last one to go, the others though I have defeated
I'm self-destructive, perhaps I need it
I know deep down I gotta do everything that I can do beat it
I don't have the key, it's locked away deep inside
My chest in a place I hate goin' so I have to leave it
I don't know if I ever can gather the strength
To grab it and face up to it and get my hand to reach it
Every time I just lose my fuckin' mind
Whilst it stands over me again and again and I'm trapped beneath it
So maybe I never can and that's the reason
I portray this image of a better man when I haven't been him
It goes back to when I was a child
Life is meant to be all smiles
Instead it took away my innocence, where everything in life
Became negative and ever since it I keep tellin' 'em
"As God as my witness"

[Chorus]
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
