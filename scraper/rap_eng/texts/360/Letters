[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late
Mr Future can you send a letter my way?
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing?
When it comes to girls would you play the same game?
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Verse 1]
If the future you could go and write a letter to yourself
Imagine all the shit that it'd say
Makes me wonder if you reckon it'd help
In the way that you treat girls and the different it'd make
I wonder if you would switch it up and respect women
Instead of tellin' all these lies just for sex with 'em
There's nothing wrong with having sex, but what's being a dog
Is you leadin' 'em on just so you'll get with 'em
Would you hit then kick her out so she's all alone
Instead of doing what's really right and walk her home?
Would you call 'em bitches? Would you call 'em hoes?
Or would you be riddled with guilt that you called 'em both?
'Cause when you go and have a baby girl you call your own
Those words, what if someone went and called your daughter those?
I know learnin' from your past is important though
I just think there's certain little things that you oughta to know

[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late (quite late)
Mr Future can you send a letter my way? (my way)
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing? (same thing)
When it comes to girls would you play the same game? (same game)
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Post-Chorus: Carl Dimataga & Whalan]
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later

[Verse 2]
When you're young as fuck you run amok, always fuckin' something up
It's funny though, that attitude eventually will come undone
If your stomach's rumblin' and churning like there's something up
That's the beginning of you learnin' how to trust your gut
If you're hurtin' just be open, never suck it up
Force it out, homie, 'cause there's none above your mothers love
Back up what your brother does, always bring each other up
Make sure your father's proud of everything his son's become
I realise your guard's up and that you stubborn, but
Listen to your fam when they tellin' you you fuckin' up
Believe in yourself with no doubt, you're number one
Fuck shootin' for the fence, go ahead and touch the sun
When it comes to life, if I had to go and sum it up
The meaning of it all to me is simple: love and love
I know [?] shit can sound corny though
To me it's real as fuck and somethin' that you oughta know

[Chorus]
I believe you become who you were
When you're old, but you get it quite late (quite late)
Mr Future can you send a letter my way? (my way)
I'ma have a guess what the letter might say
If you could see who you were to become
Do you think you would do the same thing? (same thing)
When it comes to girls would you play the same game? (same game)
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name

[Post-Chorus: Carl Dimataga & Whalan]
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later
Maybe I will see you later
I'll see you later

[Outro]
So when you go and find your own wife you need to have your own lives
Have each others backs so you both strive, ayy
What's so important though is having your alone time
But even more knowin' that you don't mind, ayy
A life you cosign, live's that you both like
Never watchin' life as it goes by, ayy
What you got together's crucial that you both thrive
Otherwise the shit is gonna nosedive, ayy
