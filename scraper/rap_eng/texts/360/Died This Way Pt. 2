[Verse 1: Bam Bam]
Yeah
Ah shit, '6, I'm back at it
But this time my bags [?] caps and acid
That's the best way to celebrate the fact
This is the last track and absolute smashed it
Fuck yes, I came for the fame
And the success, but I guess stayed for the dubstep
If it's making you upset, couldn't give a fuck less
Let 'em eat it up, '6, hit 'em with it

[Verse 2: 360]
Pull my dick out like "Hi hater"
Swingin' it around like a lightsaber
Yeah, my shit don't stink and my dick so big
When I lie down it looks like a skyscraper
(Look at that view) I'm retarded, dude
And if my son is then karma's true
Naked in the street yellin' "Melbourne city!"
Finger in my arse tryna shelf a biccie

[Verse 3: Bam Bam]
Damn right, we're back in the building
'60 and Bam Bam bad for the children
Black minivan, kidnappin' 'em all
We're givin' 'em alcohol till it actually kills 'em
I've had too many damn drugs
'6 said he quit, I'll get him to man up
Quick, somebody get him some damn nuts
'Cause I want him so drunk that he struggle to stand up

[Verse 4: 360]
If Jesus is really gonna save us all
Tell me, what the fuck is he waiting for?
If he does come, cool, then praise the Lord
When he rings the doorbell, I'ma break his jaw
(Boo) On some real shit, I'm so famous
Now, I don't know what my own name is
I know everybody, it's a great look
I even got Dane Cook on Facebook

[Chorus: 360]
We do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
What you fuckin' people say
We do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
What you fuckin' people say

[Ad-Libs: Bam Bam]
Not one single fuck was given
Ever
We don't give a fuck

[Hook: 360]
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See, my middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck, like

[Verse 5: 360]
I'm the type of dude that'd fist my cat
My arm looks good when it's inside that
Believe me, I'm high and I need it tonight
Can see in it's eyes it'll fist fight back
Off to the shop for a midnight snack
I ain't gonna pass, I'll hitch-hike back
You wanna kill me but you never will though
I'm six feet deep but my head'll still show

[Interlude: 360]
Youâ€”you understand what that means?
Like, you wanna bury me six feet deep
But I'm six-foot-four, so there's gonna be
Four feet of head, just stickin' out of the dirt ya dumb cunt

[Verse 6: Bam Bam]
I am a fucking animal
Tear you to pieces, eat you: cannibal
Rip through your house with a chainsaw blazin'
Naked, strapped to the back of a cannon ball
Catch me pissin' in public
Or takin' a shit while I listen to dubstep
Or wasted as fuck while I'm blazin' it up
No wonder that I'm failin' a drug test

[Chorus: 360]
We do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
What you fuckin' people say
Do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
Do not really give a fuck
What you fuckin' people say

[Hook: 360]
See? My middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See? My middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See? My middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck
See? My middle finger's up 'cause we don't give a fuck, like
