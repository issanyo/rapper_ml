Ground up!

[Hook]
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world

[Verse 1: PEZ]
It's always been this way, since the first beginnin' of time
'Cause we're all livin' to the rhythm of the tickets supplied
So inside, from age ten, I was scared by the threat of endin'
Just another nothing so instead of spendin'
All day in my mind, tryna fly away
I became more inclined to fight and trying to find a way
To change it, still I wonder if I'll ever listen
When television is tellin' women irrelevant things
All just to make a buck, like you can make yourself
Happy if you just pay enough, so they keep makin' up
All this new shit you need to buy
It's the same old shit with just a different reason why
Why do we always let 'em push us till we back down?
That's how we ended up stuck here in the background
In the first place, let my verse play, take a closer look
At what the words say and write back, it's like that

[Hook]
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, has it always been this way? Man, the problem is this
Believin' people who don't know what honesty is
We're full of fear, always watchin' a risk
And if it does, then I'm hopin' that it wasn't for this
And I don't believe the stories that they sell on the news
These days, you're never knowin' who is telling the truth
A bunch of liars in irrelevant suits
They get paid to tell the story and they sell it to you
It's a needle, injected in the minds of the people
They have the rights to decide who is equal
It's evil, living fools in a dumb world
Just look at what's considered cool to these young girls
How many people will accept being undermined?
How many people really say that they love their life?
How many people will fight for a fuckin' right?
Most of all you shrug it off saying, "such is life"
Now take a stand
Take a stand

[Hook]
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world
It wasn't for this, it wasn't for that
Oh, best believe a better world
