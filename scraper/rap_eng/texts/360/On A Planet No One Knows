Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home

[Verse: 360]
Uh, I can't take this shit
Looking down on the earth and the way we live
How the fuck do these parents raise their kids
And what books are they educated with?
I went on my Facebook, I displayed a pic
Of me and my mates with different shades of skin
Came back ten minutes later then
A lot of the comments are on some racist shit
And I see that shit and it makes me sick
I don't believe in God
But yo I pray to him
They're my haters sins
I don't wanna have fans that are racist pigs
We're all humans
Earth is the place we live
That's how Australia is
'Fuck off we're full' yeah that statement lives
Yeah we are full, of all you racist dicks
Uneducated, basic shit
A topic I have very little patience with
And I shouldn't even say this
If I see a group of lads with a flag I bet you some are racist
It's cool to be loving where you come from
And it's cool to be patriotic
But real talk I'm seeing a lot of hate for Aussies 'cause
A lot of us are fucking racist cockheads
Yeah don't take me wrong
Most the time you saying something
You're unaware it's something you probably shouldn't say at all
All I'm trying to do is educate you more
That ain't the way we're supposed to exist
Now I'm on a planet where nobody lives
To try how Utopians think
Where we don't change the tone of our voice for the tone of your skin

Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home
Even though I want you near me
I'm on a planet no one knows
So even though I've never been here
I've never felt so at home

[Spoken: Joss Whedon (Sampled)]
“Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.”
