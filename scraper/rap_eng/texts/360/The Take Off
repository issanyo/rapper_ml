[Pre-Intro (Sampled): Diana Ross]

[Intro: 360]
Hey yo, it's me myself and I, yeah I'm back again
I played the background watching what's been happening
I never thought, when I was fucking up in school
That this shit would even work, if it doesn't I'll be cool
Even if, for now, I only manage to scrape by
As long as I'm living off of rap, it's a great life
So I'ma take my ways I create this
And take time, cock back and aim at a great height
This is it though, I'd better step forward then
It's a chance to be forever airborne
But I'm never happy with the second best score
While I'm chasing after a dream, I never slept for
Just to get my rap on, talking about whatever I have done
Find believe even when I have none
So fuck it, I'm about to have fun
And not think about this life 'cause we only have one

[Verse 1: 360]
I'm sorry that I'm so late, yo I slept in
You can't blame me, I was having the best dream
I was watching my life up on the big screen
Had the present on pause, flicking to the next scene
It had me and everybody coming together
Sky high while we're running to heaven
Let me take you to a place where it's summer forever
So there'll be no chance in hell of feeling under the weather
But look, I know that I can be whatever I believe
I keep my feet grounded and bring the sky to me
Most people have grown egos
But it's so see through, I'll show that there's no need too
Even go that route
I did it before, but see I know that now
But see I know it's hard, but I laugh in the face of death
While living life on the edge without a safety net, let's go

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Verse 2: 360]
See I know that it's a fight to the top
And any other day, yo you're likely to flop
Some lies will arise in your eyes and entice you to stop
But the sky is the prize that I want
And how to show my style and to boast my skill
And I don't know how but I know I will
'Cause I have to be the best
It's win win for me 'cause rap relieves the stress
The industry now is in a big crisis
It's innocently down by these kid pirates
And if you listening now and think this shit's fire
Stop being ignorant now, you think it's sick? Buy it
Uh, I understand if you don't buy it
Supporters need the supporters who go find it
But for now I'ma go fly and
I'm so high that you won't find me so don't try it

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Bridge: 360 & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
The sky is falling
'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
I know you're trying call me
Down, down (the sky is falling)
Before the sky can reach the ground

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

[Outro: Styalz Fuego]
Sky is falling
