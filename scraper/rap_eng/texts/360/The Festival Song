[Intro: PEZ]
Yeah, for all the festival-heads
Check it out

[Verse 1: PEZ & 360]
All right, it’s that
Time of the year you’ve been waiting for for months now
Saving up your pay, tryna figure all your funds out
It's kind of funny when you think of all the fun how
It's taken this long to shake last year's come down
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don’t get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass, these days a week late
Can mean paying triple when you BPAY off eBay (True)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want
Should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don’t listen to rock
Nor hip-hop, I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there, you’ll think you’ll never forget
You’ll probably get that wasted, you won't remember their set
If you're a festival head, then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit, 'cause you're going on a trip

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
For those summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
For those summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
"Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front"
"Nah, bullshit man"

[Verse 2: PEZ & 360]
Now when you finally make it there
From driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you’ll be stuck there lining up in a queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts
All to get your car searched
Yeah, and with your alcohol
You're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bag (That's right)
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn’t matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once you're through, start picking your spot
Unpack and realise all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
(Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks)
And dudes are too excited, already sitting there sloshed
You know it doesn’t take long
Before you find somebody blazing up
"Mate, what are you doing?
I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd!"
And it's always the cheap fuckers who ain’t paid enough
But please note that we don’t condone taking drugs

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
"Man, how cold is it inside this tent?!"
"I know, it's freezing, man, Jesus Christ"

[Verse 3: PEZ & 360]
Now as soon as the sun rises you’ll be ready to start
At six o’clock, standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn’t end when it's dark
We all know you’ve got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you're peaking while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into backstage
(Man, let's just do it, who cares?)
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
"Nah, they're not those pills, I need 'em for my back pain"
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates, "I love you, man!"
Or on a walk so they can go
And call their mum and dad (That's PEZ)
And then there’s people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody, tryna have a D&M (Yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite
Gettin' wasted while you bake in the sun
What can I say, yo? It's a fuckin' good way to get drunk

[Chorus: Pez & Hailey Cramer]
I love summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
"Hey, what happened to you guys last night?"
"I didn't even hear the countdown or anything"

[Verse 4: PEZ]
Now by the last day you're probably thinkin' summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packin' to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again

[Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]
I love summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days, summer days
Summer days
Summer days
I love summer days
Summer days
Summer days
I love summer days

[Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]
I was gonna say I love festivals
Didn't really have the same ring to it though
Yeah
PEZ, 360
Of course Matik on the beat
Yeah
Play that shit loud
