[Intro: Bliss & Eso]
Hey yo, Macka, how you feeling today?
I feel unified, mate. Shit, I'm feeling the same
This is paradise, so enjoy the weather
A perfect time to get the boys together
We need old school, new school pioneers
Who can flip that shit like primal fear
Sun's up, man, I'm callin' the lads
One love, that's twelve balls in the bag

[Verse 1: Eso]
Yo, my crew's on some bullshit
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a poo that a bull did
I'm talkin' 'bout what sets the bar
BnE, Seth, '60, PEZ and Drapht

[Verse 2: Bliss]
He said "sets the bar", that'll blow like Escobar
Six dogs out the reservoir
Let's play connect the stars
And paint a circus in the sky, yeah, PEZ can start

[Verse 3: PEZ]
Yeah
Now we thought this crew should pull
Out something a little unusual
Sounds a bit like a musical
It doesn't matter, we make any kind of music cool

[Verse 4: 360]
Yeah, uh, when I heard the word footpath
I just thought it meant it was a foot large (I did)
But then I walked on a footpath
And I had a look, and I swear it was a good yard

[Verse 5: Drapht]
Yeah, rule of thumb
Never been the one to open up a can of worms
Never underestimate
'Cause some say we the best to date like Miranda Kerr
Hi Seth

[Verse 6: Seth Sentry]
News flash alert
Something stirred underground where the rappers lurk
In a cloud of weed smoke, with a hand full of Cheetos
I'm in Beast Mode, you better enter a cheat code

[Chorus]
Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just "give me the mic" so I can take it away

[Verse 7: Eso]
I'm like Outkast mixed with South Park
And my rhyming flow is like Dynamo
So when I bust on the beat
I'm rude like Cube yellin' "fuck the police!"
Raise 'em up
It's like all your Christmases came at once
Yes, we're too much for these rookies
Seth, let's knock the dust off their pussies

[Verse 8: Seth Sentry]
Man, I feel awesome, nah, I mean awful
Yeah I'm pretty sure I've put on weight since Autumn
Pass me the pork roll, don't really walk anymore
Ever since I invented a gun that shoots portals
Yeah, my body's gone bad
Tried to get myself a Hollywood tan
Me and Drapht went to Bali for a holiday, man
I must've put the weed in someone else's bodyboard bag
Fuck

[Verse 9: PEZ]
Leadin' from the get go
Yes, I believed it, even when they said no
Yeah, fear's like half of your thoughts
Follow your heart, that's par for the course
Of course it ain't easy
I can tell you that first hand, but it's all good
Look at us, went from studying the fundamentals
Back when we were young and now we're up here on another level

[Chorus]
Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just "give me the mic" so I can take it away

[Verse 10: Drapht]
(Yeah, check it out, yo)
This sounding like some Austin Powers shit
Someone gotta tell '60
This ain't the sixties, this ain't the same mixed
Bag of lollies, that ain't the same Frisbee
Interesting, yes, I guess
I can adjust, I guess it just means
That we gotta do it different. Good
And I'm glad 'cause the records are wrecking my Discman

[Verse 11: 360]
When I heard the beat on, I said turn it off
I thought it was the theme song from Circus Oz (turn it off)
I'm being serious, I don't give a fuck how
Turn down the sample and switch up the drums now
I got the sick drum loop
Walking 'round the city in my pink gumboots
If a hater wanna talk like "Six, fuck you"
I tell my bodyguard "Smash this cunt too"

[Verse 12: Bliss]
Last shot of the six slug revolver
Tree swingin' in on a big fucking Cobra
Shit cunts, it's over, with my honourable brethren
It's destined, Mr Orange done stepped in
The card shark, the way I play in the carpark
Doing doughies, spin a rapper out like Nardwuar
And Izm, here's a line to scratch
Hate, "Ain't nobody got time for that"

[Pre-Chorus]
Good god look who's up in the mix
You can dream but you ain't seen nothing like this
So there goes the neighbourhood get elevated with us
It's like "UNITY" it's a celebration, bitches, good god

[Chorus]
Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just "give me the mic" so I can take it away

[Turntablism: DJ Izm]
"Once again ladies and gentlemen"
"Right now it's showtime"
"Are you ready?"
"Bliss n Eso"
"Yeah, Forthwrite"
"Seth Sentry, I'm gettin' totally [?]"
"Drapht"
"That's some classic shit right there"
"Legendary mate"
