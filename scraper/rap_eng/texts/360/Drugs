[Verse 1: 360]
Straight out of the bottle shop, I'm just a hitman with one target
The worst killer in history, love carnage
You know when I'm around, it becomes darker
But it's worse when I'm not, 'cause it's much harder
You wouldn't even know when you run past me
Though many face God you won't unmask me
If you wanna know then just ask me
One minute a dumb bastard then suddenly I'm up market
You a masochist, no breaking jaws
You know it's gonna hurt but you take some more
How can you stop a killer who doesn't break the law?
Mind control, you can fight it but I'll make you poor
My spirit's gonna end up breakin' yours
There's no money but you wanna save some more
Every week though I'm gonna take it all, yeah

[Chorus: Savoi, Janeva, Reija Lee, Thief & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh (said no—o—oh)

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, I'm here to take a spirit though I'm not a distiller
Got the right shots if you wanted a killer
Yo, I'm positive, I'm not an optimist
I'ma leave you more broken than my promises
Genie in a bottle with no wishes as all (wishes at all)
The only wish you get is you wishin' for more (woo)
Cheers and booze at the same time (same time)
Ayy, every victim I have made blind (made blind)
Ayy, sucker punch and you swallow it with guilt
Another cup then I promise it'll heal
Half-full, don't stop until it's filled, yeah

[Chorus: Savoi, Janeva, Reija Lee, Thief & Styalz Fuego]
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh
'Cause no one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo, no—o—oh
Said no—o—oh (said no—o—oh)

[Post-Chorus: 360 & [?]]
Shots in the morning, keep it going
Shots through the evening, stay lonely
Another day gone and we ain't notice
Oo—o—oo—oh yeah
Shots in the morning stay flowin'
Shots through the evening, chain-smoking
Another day gone and we ain't notice
Oo—o—oo—oh yeah

[Bridge: Reija Lee]
I give it up to find [?]
There was just too much to lose
Now there's a lot of fans of mine
That can love me just like you

[Verse 3: 360]
How many lives will I kill today?
A storm is brewin', bound to see people hurt
I pretend I'm gonna take your guilt away
But all I do is make it even worse
I'm everywhere from reflections of any wine glass
To the echoes of emptiness where you hide flasks
Destruction perfected into a fine art
Justice would kill me instead of sitting behind bars

[Outro: 360]
No one loves me like the
Drugs used to, oo—
Oo—oo—oo
Oo—oo—oo—oo—oo—oo
No one love me like the
Drugs used to
No one love me like the
Drugs used to
