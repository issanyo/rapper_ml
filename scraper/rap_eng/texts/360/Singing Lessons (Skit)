[Intro]
Drop those panties, girl, show me your front bum
Can I get my sing on for you tonight, girl? Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I've been doing this for a while now
Finally starting to kick off

[Hook]
Doing my singing lessons, girl
(I do it on a regular week, yeah)
Ah yeah, doing my singing lessons, girl
(Every Tuesday night, 7:30, Dianne is her name)
Doing my singing lessons, yeah
(Yeah, Dianne is old but quite in tune with her spirit)
Doing my singing lessons, girl

[Verse 1]
Uh, all I wanted back then was some singing lessons
Mum got me five months as a Christmas present
Never would expect that I would sound smooth
Busting out all these notes but with no moves
The white Denzel, stylish as hell
Sometimes compared me to Tyrese as well
If you want some white chocolate, then I've got it
You'll see me singing around in your bifocals

[Hook]
Doing my singing lessons, girl
I'm doing my singing lessons, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, I know you like it smooth like the velvet rain
That drops from the sky's winter storm
