[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They say the best rappers have died
So make way for the best rapper alive
And they hate gets sent back in a line
And some have come close, the rest haven't survived
I got it yo, it's my turn [?]
Pay attention and you might learn something
360, I'm like Biggie Smalls
The difference is I'm white, thin, and tall
Yo, I dominate locally
After that yo, I'll dominate globally
I'll be patiently taking it overseas
And show the world ain't got nothing over me
Yo I'm looking for some heads to kill
Step to the 6, you can test your skill
Bring 'em all out, they get kicked in the mouth
And the king's in the house so the rest should kneel

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
All along the Eastern shore

[Verse 2]
Damn, '60 getting on his techno shit
Jumpin' aboard the electro ship
But the beat is impressive, how the fuck
He gonna get any love for this metro shit
Since the song with Pez no shit
With girls, I haven't heard the N.O. since
Heard some on that yes no tip
Know they shouldn't but they wanna like yes no shit
Hip-hop yes, yes it'll change
For beats like this I'm accepting the blame
Sent them away 'fore we left in a plane
Gettin' trapped in the sky while the rest will remain
I've been doing it since grade 5 dude
And to get here it takes time, true
Motherfucka I done paid my dues
It's game time (Hey?), so they might lose

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Do what you

[Verse 3]
Yo to get where I'm at yo it took its time
Gotta keep going, never look behind
And I ain't thinking I should be fine
'Cause I know that I will be, I'll go till it kills me
Keep looking up inside for the rescue
Understand that in time it will get you
Fuck the stars, I'm flying to Neptune
I'll get what I want, in my mind is the menu
Now I know that I'm finally there
While you're striving and fighting for guys to respect you
You can tell that it might be the year
And it's time, and it's rightfully mine, I can end you

[Outro]
