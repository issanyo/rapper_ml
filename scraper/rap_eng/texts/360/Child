[Hook 1:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 1]
I had a father who came from nothing
He took that and he made it something
He’d seen it all by his twenty-first, right
His mum and dad both left this Earth, why?
It was the drinking that killed his mother
He’s watching the same thing kill his brother
And he doesn’t say it much but he really loves us
And he doesn’t want the same thing to kill his sons
When he sees me with a drink in my hand
I understand now why he thinks that it’s bad
'Cause he knows that it’s so evil
But he knows we’re our own people, so he lets us go

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 2:]
See, I don’t know if God’s real
But, if he is, I can image how God feels
And there’s things I’d discuss with him
I bet he wouldn’t change much but there’s shit he would have done different
When my grandpa passed away
I remember saying bye on his last few days
And I’m hoping there’s a heaven
I want to meet again
And I never met anybody as positive as him
Not many were as sick as him
But he didn’t let the illness kill his grin
And that’s why I went ahead and inked my skin
'Cause I remember the smile when I think of him

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

[Verse 3:]
I didn’t know that my brother got bullied in school
If I could go back now, I wouldn’t be fooled
He probably thought mum and dad don’t fucking care
But it wasn’t even that, they were so unaware
Living in a family where money is favoured
Makes us want to say, I fucking hate it
Brother though, we gotta feel blessed as fuck
Just remember, they only want the best for us
We got a mum that’s an angel, I’m thankful
Just to even have her in my life, I am grateful
Family is anybody that close to you
See this song right here, it is overdue for you

[Hook 2:]
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
