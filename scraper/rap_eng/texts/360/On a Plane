[Verse 1: GMC]
Running from my gravity, getting high on the low-low
She never smoked so this her first time riding this coco
Pilot to the island, tropical weather is oh so
Perfect, in a dream state, and I can't even see straight
Smoke up in the apart-e-ment, setting off the alarm again
And we living this life with no consequence, the game we playing, there are no benches
Slo-mo in that greyscale like a movie picture or magazine
Eyes low when I'm deep in it, I'm wide awake, I never had a dream
Feel this realer, even be this vivid
Baby, look up in the sky to see the life I'm living

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home

[Post-Chorus: GMC (360)]
And we high and we fly when want to
And we roll and we go where we want to
And we ain't gon' take nobody else, you ain't gotta worry 'bout
Anything when you're this high (Yo)

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, I am everything you really hate, genuinely feeling safe
Don't forget to take your pills today
You got that medicine to heal the pain
You know those chemicals'll kill your brain
Kids are taking ecstasy to feel awake
And little girls are getting pregnant like it is okay
But it isn't, mate, do that shit on a different day
Now with the methamphetamines and the ketamine is streetbound with no shit to chase
Now, who am I to talk and who am I to y'all?
I paint the line I walk 'cause life is short till lyin' in chalk
Does it matter the time, just stop
We making that music that's timeless, watch

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home

[Post-Chorus: GMC]
And we high and we fly when want to
And we roll and we go where we want to
And we ain't gon' take nobody else, you ain't gotta worry 'bout
Anything when you're this high

[Verse 3: Daniel Merriweather]
Fighting my demons 'cause they'll never leave me
Alone
They trying to keep me but reality's holding
[?]
The devil keeps calling me, but I never answer
The phone
Now we speak different languages, so all he can hear is
The tone
I was flying on the highest, flying on the highest
Altitude that's possible to be
They be wearing their disguises, wool over their eyelids
And now it's impossible to see
Forgot about the times we had
I tore apart the boarding pass (flight canceled)
Denying the hand and the card that they dealt you
The eye of the storm is just looking right past you
Flight note: flight canceled
Flight note: flight canceled

[Chorus: GMC]
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
And you can see me on a plane, flying with nowhere to go
Go, go, go
And if you leaving on this plane with me you will never wanna
Come home, come home
