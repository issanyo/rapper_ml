[Intro]
Naomi Campbell

[Verse 1]
Uh
I got a pet midget, I call him Muggsy Bogues
He's my best friend, and he's got stunted growth
All the drugs he takes; the reason that he's under-grown
But mess with us and we will start chucking phones like Russell Crowe
I'm watchin' money grow, yeah, I got my wealth on me
And I'm about to book my trip to see Schapelle Corby
I'm just tryna help her out because he cell's boring
And I just stumbled on some weed that she can sell for me

[Chorus]
Naomi Campbell
Naomi Campbell

[Verse 2]
I got a fantasy, a fantasy of partying with Kate Moss
Retarded everyday and going harder when they say stop
They wanna get inside our heads, fuck 'em
Yo, we ain't bending it like Beckham, yo, we bending it like Ben Cousins
We ain't stopping till six in the morning
Fuck that we ain't stopping till our chins hit the floor and
We are out for life, everybody passes out, goodbye
And 28 Days Later's what our house looks like

[Chorus]
Naomi Campbell
Naomi Campbell

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I party the way that I want to, so go on and judge me, I'm not you
Yo, this is the way I've been living forever and yes, I'm admitting I've got to
If you can bring Jessica Biel, yo, we got the ecstasy pills
We'll meet you in Beverly Hills, we already paid for the medical bill, for real
And still we running from cop cars
This paranoia from never working this job's harsh
We spend our days just living like we rock stars
I guess in every way we are without the rock part

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong

[Chorus]
Naomi Campbell
Naomi Campbell
