[Intro]
All right, yo

[Verse 1]
There's certain things that make me angry
Like almost having car accidents with a crazy taxi
Or letting 'em in front and they don't wave to thank me
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
And it's like when you're chillin' at the best party
And these dudes rock up like they're a flex army
No surprise at all, they're rockin' Ed Hardy
([?] bounce [?]) (I hate you)
Or, or when you see a bunch of wasted lads
And they ain't wearin' shit except the Australian flag
I wonder if it comes built in with racial slags
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
Or when you go into your mate's house in middle-December
He lives one stop away and this is minimal effort
Then you get off and run into some ticket inspectors
(Um... from Sydney)

[Chorus]
So I'm like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da"
Like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da"

[Verse 2]
It's like going through a stage where you haven't had sex for months
Then you head home with someone you've slept with once
And then you're so nervous that you can't get it up
(Just work [?]) (I hate you) Uh
You want my mate in the bedroom, wanting him to sex you
Saying be quick 'cause your boys in the next room
Then you crack it 'cause none of us'll respect you, no
(Bitch) (I hate you) Uh
Yo, bitch, you were so thick, oh shit
Those lips you bought have you looking like a blowfish
And you could prob'ly knock me out with those tits
(Hats, boobs, bangers, chest pumped, dang) (I hate you)
And when I'm in a club dancin' with a beer
And a dude comes up and starts rappin' in my ear
Wanna know what I think like I actually can hear
(I can't fucking hear you, mate)

[Chorus]
So I'm like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da"
Like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da"

[Verse 3]
Uh
Ayo, I'm cool with a homeless dude bumming some change
But if I say that, "I'm sorry, I got nothing to pay"
And then you're pissed off up in my face like you got something to say
(I hate you) And, uh
If I'm with a mate, tell him that it's my 'round
Dude, don't go thinking that it's my shout
Now you're acting like I'm paying for your night out
(Cheap fuck) (I hate you)
Fall in love with a girl, feels like it's the best thing
Give her anything, can't wait for the next day
Argh, the whole time she's using you for your best mate
(Mate) (I hate you)
Uh, my mate slept with a girl and he tried to hit the exit
Six months later, she was kinda gettin' hectic
Didn't know he was the guy she was obsessed with
Kept him there the whole time lying she was pregnant

[Chorus]
So I'm like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da"
Like, "Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da
Da"
