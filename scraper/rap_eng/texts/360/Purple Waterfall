[Intro: 360]
Feel like I'm in paradise
Watch that purple waterfall
Got me feelin' rich, so rich
Never go and poor it all

[Verse 1: 360]
Come see the cloud that I live in
I mean the couch that I sit in
I said I stopped but I didn't
It's another world that I been in, listen
When I'm on it I think I'm a king
Top of the world without doing a thing
When it's gone, I'm literally sinking
And I'm tryna look for a lizard with wings
Let me get some sleep
And some rest in peace
Got me scratching a lot
And my head is nodding without hip-hop beats
Eyes closed, where'd sight go?
I think time's going to waste
We're mind blown
I think mind's goin' to space

[Refrain: 360]
Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me
But I'm jaded, no escapin'
The escape I need
Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me
But I'm jaded, no escapin'
The escape I need

[Chorus: Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

[Verse 2: 360]
Leanin', can't stay up
On one, that main buzz
Purple all of my paint brush
Found a way to make pain stop
Made up a nocturnal breed
Stay stuck in this perfect dream
I'm faded, but I
Wake up the second that the curtains bleed
And I'm slurring speech
Yo, I think I needa learn to speak
Been a while you ain't heard from me
But I stay, drown in that purple stream
Eyes lookin' like it hurts to read
And it burns to see
But if I lose spit, then just let me know
If my eyes close I deserve to sleep

[Chorus (Extended): Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

[Bridge: 360]
I'm feelin' wide awake, wide awake
I'm chasin' the dragon to hide the pain, hide the pain
Come see the cloud that I live in
I said I stopped, but I didn't

[Chorus (Extended): Daniel Johns]
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough
My purple waterfall
Slow drip (slow drip)
I've said enough
And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough
