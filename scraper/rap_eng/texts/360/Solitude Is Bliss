[Verse 1: 360]
Ugh, 60's back
Yo, it's been a little while, bet you miss this cunt
I'ma give you facts, my advice: you should like this
Ninja, I can fly kick a fly's dick
That's mad ninja shit
Mad shit, even my ad-libs are sick
Yo, I came to do this
A battle MC who makes crazy music
And you can step in a ring and you'll be worse off
I ain't religious but I'm ready to serve God
And there be no O.T
You might know 360, you don't know me
Yo, I'm so low-key I wanna fly to the Netherlands
And go and get so high that I never land
You suckers ain't close to me
Because I'm looking up knowing where I'm sposed to be, like

[Chorus: Kevin Parker (Sampled)]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Verse 2: 360]
Yo, yeah, yo
Ayo, talk if you wanna get pushed around
'Cause I'm awesome, homie, I ain't looking down
Talk shit a lot, but you're shook around me
When I die they'll even write a book about me
360: The Chronicles, dude
If there's no vodka the chronic'll do
I'm so fly and I'm high that I'm off to the moon
Sick of wings in hospitals, dude
In the winter always got my sunny's on
Why's that? 'Cause I haven't slept all summer long
To me this is sorta like a summer song
And we killed that shit so run along
Packing a MAC in the back of an actual Ac'
Like Big Pun, but I'm actually fatter than that
I got what you happen to lack
And I ain't married to rap, homie, that'd be faggoty as

[Chorus: Kevin Parker (Sampled)]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
