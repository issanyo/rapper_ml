[Verse 1: Bam Bam]
Yeah
I don’t really plan for the future
I just wanna sit around and dance to the music
Hold hands, romance under moonlit stars
And get a bit of a buzz and a few spliffs
I wanna feel the vibe, wanna come alive
And get sweaty having sex in the summertime
‘Cause I don’t wanna die regretting that I
Let it slide instead of me trying whatever I liked, uh
But some people got it all backwards
They needa live a little more like it all matters
Take a day off, and do whatever makes you smile
Quit work and get away for a while, huh
Spend a little time on yourself
And I promise you will definitely find that it helps, so
Make the most of every single moment
Now ‘cause at any given minute it’ll be over

[Chorus: 360]
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
‘Cause I won’t throw it away, throw it away
See all this time I’m takin’, why do it for?
I won’t waste it, so I do it all
Life, life

[Verse 2: Bam Bam]
Yeah
Some people think this type of life isn’t smart
It’s a little hard but you fight it regardless
Uh, ‘cause in the life of an artist
You always gotta find a little light in the darkness
Yeah, and I be lovin’ every minute of it
I don’t ever wanna be the one to be wonderin’ what if
I never had this? What if I never gave it a shot
Or went at it with everything that I got, uh
‘Cause I don’t wanna work for a livin’
If it isn't what I love, what’s it worth even livin’?
I’m on a mission to pave a path out of my passion
And so far, so good, no lookin’ backwards
I gotta say the bright lights are attractive
But one day, that’ll fade to black and that's it
So I gotta make the most of now
And hopefully I can grow to be the poster child
Haha, I’m just livin’ my life, yo

[Chorus: 360]
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
‘Cause I won’t throw it away, throw it away
See all this time I’m takin’, why do it for?
I won’t waste it, so I do it all
Life, life

[Verse 3: Bam Bam]
Yo
Whether you’re one of the ones that believe in
A dream or even if you’re an under achiever
You’re a freelancer workin’ nine to five
You got trust fund money or just tryna survive this life
You gotta allocate time for the little things
I did it and I’m feelin’ alive from it ever since
Make the most of every minute you have
It’s a fact that you know that you’re never getting it back, so

[Chorus: 360]
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
And I be livin’ it day by day
‘Cause I won’t throw it away, throw it away
See all this time I’m takin’, why do it for?
I won’t waste it, so I do it all
Life, life
