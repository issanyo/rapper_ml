[Intro (Sampled): [?]]
Now please move on

[Chorus (Condensed): 360 (PEZ)]
It's all the same as I keep on walkin' (yeah)
It doesn't change but I keep on walkin' (uh)
It's all the same as I keep on walkin' (yeah)
And move my feet till I find me another way (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: PEZ]
It's that lone vision inside, but my flow's written
So different that, shit, it's simply unnoticed when most listen
They say death, and it bears a heaven or devil defined
The step it's indefinite [?] send me a message and try to
Help me out, wish I could speak to a [?]
Just tell me now, meanwhile, what's held me down till now
Is that inner force that brings the thoughts to my head
To fall to my pen and form it all before it gets read
So I sit down and open a page
Focus and wait a moment till I know what I'll say
And I think how I wonder why that fear is
A mind trapped to life that comes right back here, where I
See defeat in every word that I write
I turn in my mind and find myself immersed in uncertainty, why?
It's like a curse, when it occurs I deter
And I try to fight it internally till it's worse and I'm nervous, in fright
We're in this world givin' birth, but I've hurt my entire
Time on this earth 'cause I can't determine a purpose for life
PEZ is the person that's observant inside
Tryna interpret the science side and emerge on the surface and glide
We get one turn, you can't rehearse it, return and then try it
Again instead just be alert for the turbulent ride
On this journey and this search for a permanent high
Where you're more likely to be a servant and work to survive
I've learned to rely on fate to reshape what I say
And fate to erase all the weights and pain'll get taken away
It'll break all our hate and they can mistake or convey
The faded belief, you perceive it's evil that's making me say:

[Chorus: 360 (PEZ)]
It's all the same as I keep on walkin' (yeah)
It doesn't change but I keep on walkin' (left to right)
It's all the same as I keep on walkin'
And move my feet till I find me another way (yeah)
And I keep on walkin' (uh)
It doesn't change, but I keep on walkin' (left to right)
It's all the same as I keep on walkin'
And move my feet till I find me another way (uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: PEZ]
Now I'm flippin' it back and this is a rap for anyone listenin' that
They keep on just hearing this music and [?] the people involved and they're sick of the fact
I spit it with tact, creative with words, so label the gift of the gab
Uh, it's hidden with facts [?] see it and so all the critics attack
And they're too quick to judge; way too quick to judge
But even the people around me do it, ah, so this is love, ha
I guess there's a curse to let your words combine with a pen and the paper
Converting a verse, forgetting what hurts and not even thinking till later
Begin on your own, it's written alone, but people who listen they carry it
See, air can hurt, they hear one rhyme and suddenly question my character
You gotta be kiddin' me, thinkin' and sayin' that shit could be breaking my spirit (uh)
Try handle the fact that I might just not mean everything that I say in my lyrics (yeah)
So this is me right now, to those who speak: "pipe down"
But nevertheless, I'll never accept [?] the heat die down
Thinkin' [?] might sound, ''cause Matik can kill with the sample
Uh, oh shit, there's an example

[Chorus: 360 (PEZ)]
It's all the same as I keep on walkin'
It doesn't change but I keep on walkin' (left to right)
It's all the same as I keep on walkin'
And move my feet till I find me another way (take [?] down)
And I keep on walkin' (yeah)
It doesn't change, but I keep on walkin' (left to right)
It's all the same as I keep on walkin'
And move my feet till I find me another way (yeah)
