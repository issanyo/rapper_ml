[Intro]
It's 360, we're gonna play a bit of rapper tag
So usually in a rap cypher, there's a circle of rappers
There's the guy rapping, and the next guy next to him is the person to go next
So seeing as we're not in a circle right here and it's just like a YouTube cypher, you have to call out the person you want to go next
So I'ma start this off

[Verse]
It's 360, we about to play rapper tag
So I need to know where about's the rapper's at?
You hear the beat in the drums, it's a massive track
So if I mention your name then you have to rap
Three months ago I crashed in a Go Kart
It's cause I'm so fucking good that I don't park
So don't ask how real is that
But I ain't talkin' Go Karts when I kill this track, like
I had a problem with my balls, yo, you don't know what
Some had thought it would be Photoshopped
Yo, I woke up this morning like I'm RoboCop
Stormed outside to go and make my Coco Pops
Yeah, chocolate cereal, gangster shit
Mum poured me the cereal, I said 'thank you, bitch'
Nah I didn't, don't think I'm a G
Yo, I said 'thank you mum' and gave a kiss on the cheek, yeah

[Outro]
Boom son! Rapper tag! I'm calling out - I'm calling out old mate Urthboy. You're next - you're next bro. Don't leave it hanging too long. And then you tag the next person you want to go after you and so on and so forth. Alright, peace out
