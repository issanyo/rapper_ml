[Intro: 360]
The Son, 360, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
I know, I know that I can be a juvenile
And you know, you know that you can be one to and I'm
Never growing up but it's going down
Never in my mind, all I know is now

[Chorus: [?] (360)]
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
All I know
All I know

[Verse 1: 360]
I am Ironman, Spiderman, with my giant hands
Eating buildings with my motherfucking tiger fangs
Eating children with my motherfucking iron gang
We drinking till we get retarded 'cause I am Sam
And I ain't buying into bullshit, I'm buying land
And everything I spit is flames, I'm a fire ant
I smoke weed and I admit I'm a fiend
I'm pro-green and I ain't talking bout that British MC

[Pre-Chorus: 360]
I know, I know that I can be a juvenile
And you know, you know that you can be one to and I'm
Never growing up but it's going down
Never in my mind, all I know is now

[Chorus: [?] (360)]
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
(Yo, I'm in it for the)
All I know

[Verse 2: 360]
You make zero sense like a fucking rapper nazi
Your cheesy shit is getting burnt like Saganaki
If I have a party, people will arrive glammed and classy
And leave the shit looking like a pack of carnies
When I eat Japanese food I'll be that freak dude
Throwing food around the room like it's Teppanyaki
I don't make hip-hop, I'm making sick songs
But if I'm getting pissed off then someone's getting pissed on

[Chorus: [?] (360)]
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
Hear my mind
The limit is the sky, sky, sky
All I know, all I know
I'm in it for the right, right, right
Right
