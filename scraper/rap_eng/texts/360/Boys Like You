[Refrain: 360]
Ayo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't trying to play around
I need it, I need it, you can probably see it
You'll probably think I'm going to rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave you
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me, but you gotta be fair
Though you might've heard about the numbers that I sleep with
That's not all I am, but at least there ain't no secrets

[Chorus: Gossling]
Now, Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

[Verse: 360]
Ayo, you've heard about me, right?
You're knowin' that my rep's renowned
Your friends will tell you, "Stay away", because I've slept around
That's how it works though, the word'll get around
Back in the day, it didn't phase me though
But lately, it has kept me down
And yo, I brought it on myself, but I ain't mad about it
I kept count, but why the fuck did I brag about it?
But I'll admit it though, my rep is deserved
But I'll be real, I want to kill it though
'Cause having that rep is a curse
My last girl cheated on me with a close friend
That's two relationships, I had to watch 'em both end
But see, it messed with me, the two people I trusted most
I could shrug it off on drunkenness, but fuck 'em both
See, that switched something inside of me
A beast came alive in me
And started just eating away the pride in me
Because we're known to make mistakes
And I've grown to make a change
I was different back then, but now I ain't the same

[Chorus: Gossling]
Now, Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

[Refrain: 360]
Ayo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't trying to play around
I need it, I need it, you can probably see it
You'll probably think I'm going to rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave you
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me, but you gotta be fair
Though you might've heard about the numbers that I sleep with
Yeah, that might be true, but it's you I want to be with

[Chorus: Gossling]
Now, Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you
