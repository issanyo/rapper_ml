[Verse 1:]
If you don't know we were sent to kill
Some have mentioned and said we're ill
They don't know what our illness is
So we're left to just kill this shit
Take a look and see the armies forming
Hear the steps as we're marching forward
Fight back and just ask for more blood
One touch turn your arse to sawdust
We step from above
Burning our feet on the edge of the sun
Murder the streets in a way that it's never been done
Who said this ain't meant to be fun?
Pray to Jesus cause he's your savior
Right now not even he will save you
But at least you're gonna meet your maker
Tell him that 60 said hi, I will see you later

[Hook:]
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
How would you feel to know a killer, killer?
What if I was a killer, killer?

[Verse 2:]
You can go ahead and judge me but
You don't know how good this feels
What it's like to be finally murdering something that should be killed
Yo, I gotta get my license to kill
So I'm down here to tighten my skill
If I spend the right time in the field
Then I know that I finally will
No more fear is inside of us
No laws here gonna apply to us
Better be aware, you'll be seeing your death bed
'Cause of us, a lot of people have slept there
This is intimidation, right?
The kingpins, you can face em
Gotta see there's a killing to be made
So it's off with their head, win win situation, killer

[Hook:]
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
What if you were to know a killer, killer?
How would you feel to know a killer, killer?
What if I was a killer, killer?

[Outro:]
Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killer, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't know we were sent to kill-kill
Know we were sent to kill
Some have mentioned and said we're ill-ill
I-i-i-i-ill-ill
If you don't know we were sent to kill-kill
Know we were sent to kill
Some have mentioned and said we're ill-ill
I-i-i-i-i-ill-ill
