[Chorus (Sampled): Robin Pecknold]
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do

[Ad-Libs: 360]
Yeah, 360
Fourty K balling, bitch!
I know I said "We just got started," but fuck that shit, we haven't even begun
I hope you're ready to stand the fuck up
What's that? Shush cunt, that's what I thought

[Verse 1: 360]
Yeah, I'm on another motherfucking level
I'm sick of hearing all these others, yo, they're nothing special
I don't understand why these little fucks respect you
What you sparking with? Why you lying, bitch?
I'm seeing life and gonna be a massive high
Why? Because I'm sitting on a satellite
Bye, and I am ready for the action
Getting used to all the flashing lights, fuck being camera shy
So if you really think about it
We'd probably die without music, 360 can't live without
It's all expected to go and get a suit and tie
The way I see it that is death or mental suicide
Where I come from rapping ain't a real job
But I have to do it, if I don't then I feel lost
They say invest in some real prospects
But we only live once though so really what's the real cost

[Chorus (Sampled): Robin Pecknold]
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do

[Bridge: 360]
I'm looking down on Earth from a massive height
Because I'm sitting on a satellite
And even if I never grab the mic
I know that I'm alive so I'll always live a happy life

[Verse 2: 360]
Whaddup people, I really hope you're feeling good
It's been a fucking great day so you really should
But if anybody telling you to fucking quit
Even to the fucking chicks tell 'em all to suck your dick

[Hook: 360]
Oh-oh
If they wanna even talk they can go ahead and bring it on
No-oh
If they standing in my way, I don't care, I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all
I'ma kill 'em all

[Verse 2 (Continued): 360]
Yeah, I'm now working at building to make the flow more ether
We got no ceilings, but no floors either
Staring at the sky, always seem to be counting sheep
But every sheep never seems to amount to sleep
I'm in a room doing lines of coke with a dane chick
While you're with your best mate fighting over the same bitch
I'm getting faded while driving slow in the Matrix
And after every show I'm flying home in a spaceship

[Chorus (Sampled): Robin Pecknold]
Sunlight over me no matter what I do (I'm that fly)
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
