[Ad-Libs: 360]
Yeah
(Please be seated! Thank you!)
Yeah
360, "Pass Out"

[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth (Sampled)]
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting large now
And I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now
Went to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out
Then I told 'em how I'm gonna murder "Pass Out"
Let it rain, let it pour away
(Yeah) We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Verse: 360]
Ayo, I guarantee you suckers that I'm one of a kind
Change your perspective and have you wondering why
I'm being honest when I'm saying that I'm loving my life
If life's a bitch, yo, it's 'cause you ain't fucking her right
(You're pretty loose ayy, 6?) Yeah, mate, I reckon
I'll pass out drunk on the stairway to heaven
These bitches wanna see what making love will get them
Dangerfield shirts; I got a crazy dumb collection
Had these labels in a bidding war
Had to decide that if we're gonna be signed and what figure for
Gotta lock 'em in a [?]
But I've gotta make a killing 'cause I can't be fucked living poor
I don't do it 'cause I think it'll sell
I'ma do the same shit if it sits on the shelf
But I gotta go and treat it like a business as well
So if the shit ain't gonna kill it I'll be kicking myself
Me and Pez are gonna see more and get more
The champ is in the building, go and gimme my belt (Cheers)
A major label ain't the be all and end all
But trust me, motherfucker, I'm convinced that it helps, yo
I don't feel like swapping the flow
Keep doing what I'm doing and I want you to know
That it's a one way street, but I'm blocking the road
With no choice but to sit there and watch it explode
Yeah, head overseas, man, burn it down
And fly back, watch him fade in a blurry cloud
And if you got a big sister go and turn it loud
The show's over, so go and put the curtain down (down)
Check your size, bitch, you're below me
If you pouring me a drink you better pour it slowly
I ain't pouring out liquor for my fallen homies
Nah, I'm pouring out liquor 'cause I'm awesome, blow me

[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth (Sampled)]
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting large now
And I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now
Went to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out
Then I told 'em how I'm gonna murder "Pass Out"
Let it rain, let it pour away
(Yeah) We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Bridge (Sampled): Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
Whoa
Whoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh
Whoa
Whoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh
Uh, look at me I've been a cheeky [bastard] man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I'm
In here laying on my back
Saying DJ won't ya gimme one more track

[Refrain (Sampled): Tinie Tempah]
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Chorus (Sampled): Labrinth]
Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out
