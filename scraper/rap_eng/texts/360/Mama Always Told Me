[Chorus: Madison Love]
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Ayy, they talk a lot
Your friends say "He’s troublesome"
“Don’t do it, you’ll get hurt”
But, they don’t know where I’m coming from
'Cause if I do make you the one
I could never love another one
I’m just saying, give it a chance
I don’t see what you’re running from
Love is pain, love is risk
On the flip side, love is bliss
Honestly, let’s go for this
Take a shot, not gonna miss
All started with just a kiss
I walked up and grabbed your wrists
Fast forward the crash course
Now we’re here, imagine this (you know)
Love comes for a season or a reason
Some things you gotta know before you leavin'
Know this goes against everything you believe in
But I'm crazy about you, this ain't pretend

[Chorus: Madison Love]
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Label me as a bad guy
Safe bet, I'm the anti
Chastise, throw dirt on me
That’s how it is, don’t ask why
Everyone’s got their opinion
But I don't know why cats lie
I would never let that fly
Honestly, I’m not that guy (I'm not that guy)
Now, don't believe everything you hear
All these people wanna interfere
Fuck ‘em all, it’s our world
Can’t let 'em get into here
We could really build something strong
Think where we could be in a year
You've gotta give me a fair chance
Before you tell me we’re finished here
Already know you’ve been hurt before
Understand what you're afraid of
Talk's cheap, actions speak
Let me show you, I'm demonstrative
We could rewrite the old story
Let’s get it started, let’s get creative
'Cause I'm the one
Honesty and loyalty is what I'm made of

[Chorus: Madison Love]
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don’t hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don’t mess around with boys like you
