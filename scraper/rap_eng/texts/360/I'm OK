[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

[Verse 1: 360]
Uh yeah, welcome aboard, we don’t want to make this album small
So, tell you mates that we will sell some more silly
Man, I’m hoping that Melbourne’s all with me
Take them on the road to help perform with me
I ain’t even gonna waste a breath
And I ain’t even gonna break a sweat
I came with the aim to get the same respect in one year
As these lames that have played for ten
See a lot of them have played to death
Yo, I don’t hate them but honestly I ain’t impressed with them
See you gonna wanna change directions
They be second but don’t place me next to them
I’m in a league of my own
And if they don’t like it, then each to their own
See, I don’t listen to the hate, I don’t need it to grow
And I know that I reap what I sow so go ahead and

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

[Verse 2: 360]
I was a young kid, overly known for dumb shit
I had a big mouth, I was known to run it
Only some didn’t think I’d overcome it
The only percentage that I know's a hundred
Yeah, I ain’t following leaders here
Nah ah, cause honestly I ain’t gotta compete with them
Nah, I gotta team I gotta believe in
And it’s my turn to be on the receiving end
We won’t ever be fallen
I brought em a life they will never be bored in
I walk in the life while I'm kicking the door in
And show the motherfuckers that I'm putting my all in
Uh, they can see that my sound is changing
'Cause, to me, I believe that they are outdated
And it seems that the crown’s vacant
And to take it I need to be ground breaking and so

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

[Bridge: Styalz Fuego (36)]
The fear is gone and I don’t care, I feel fine
(Yeah I’m OK)
The fear is gone, I still don’t care, I’m feeling fine
(Yeah I’m OK)

[Verse 3: 360]
Uh yeah, yo ah
Yo, I don’t like thinking what could have been
But I can’t help hating what shouldn’t be
See a lot of people wouldn’t dream
Even when they are put to sleep
But you can tell when you look at me
There’s things that I’ve wanted to say
I’m gonna bring in a positive change
That’s a promise I’ve made
And I’ma take that blame
And haters are all good, I’ll be a OK

[Hook: Styalz Fuego]
Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK
