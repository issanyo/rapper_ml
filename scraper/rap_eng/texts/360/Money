[Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

[Verse 1: 360]
Life is all about gettin' paid, make it all at that mental rate
Go and put the shit where your mouth is, showin' off your expensive taste
Ayy, livin' it up, not givin' a fuck, all you wantin' is a million bucks
Spendin' every little bit in a month and showin' you richer than us
Yep
Shinin', shinin' wow, how you buy that nicer house
Always spendin' that high amount, what you wearin' is hired now (woo)
Got you thinkin' that what you're makin' it'll buy the crown
What you spend it'll make you better than everyone in your entire town
Boy, you got mad loot, ain't nobody that is boss as you
You will never be the one without real ones so you go and get a squad tattoo
Look, where you shop at, yo, you drop stacks, and you pop tags, and you got cash
That Fendi that was not bad like, "Where the fuck did you cop that?"
Like goddamn, these younger kids they've have gone mad
They see the way you livin', homie, they want that too (want that)
When you fuckin' grow they'll come to know that it's nothin' though, but it's funny, yo
You got a money phone 'cause their contacts as lost as you, you're gone

[Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

[Post-Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)

[Verse 2: 360]
Hustle, hustle everyday livin’ for that paper, boy
Sellin’ drugs and be your own boss so you ain’t employed
Money over bitches (what?), money over bitches (what?)
Are you really gonna go and tell me that it’s money over women? (oh)
I was the guy who was fine with it all, up in my mind I was dying for more
I took advice from the guys who had tried it before
(They took an L) Decided my life was designed to be more
The sky was my callin', I took it all, and we’re only alive for the tiniest portion
Acquired a fortune, livin’ it up, life—it was sorted
Buyin’ up all of society’s thoughts and make me a guy who was highly important
Life was so awesome, finally scorchin’, throwin’ around until five in the mornin’
Addicted to money and diamonds and thought it was all about that and the high of performin'
Kinda distorted, the title was awesome, decided to call it
Falling & Flying, but kind of ironic, ‘cause suddenly shifted from flying to fallin’
Funny how everyone think of the poor, thinkin' their life ain't worth livin' at all
Go and visit some kids in Nepal and see that the poorest are richest of all

[Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

[Post-Chorus: Sydnee Carter]
Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money
