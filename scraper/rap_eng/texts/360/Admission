[Verse]
The most successful people I know have taken more than ten l's
They just kept fightin' while the rest fell
I know success well, but first I had to
Come to understand failure and use it as the best help
See, I learnt more from one time failing
Than all of my success combined, so don't stress now
When everything gettin' sent south
For the height you wanna end up, in time you will be sent down
You prefer how success felt, yes
Instead of cryin' a river it gets you ready to set sail
That's a story lots of men tell
I can't imagine what it's like for women knowin' that flesh helps
I ain't talkin' stem cells
Sex sells, if your chest is XL then you'll excel
If you demand respect
It doesn't matter if you dress well, what matters, where your head's held
Understand knowledge is the best wealth
Put trust in everything your common sense tells
And always give your best self
And no matter how it ends up you knowin' that you meant well
Get it together whenever you mess up
You'll be better than ever, you never been better
But see, the more belief you got the more better you get
Whenever you get in a beef go and dead it, whatever
See, the paper comes and goes, but a friend is forever
Understand time is money, go and spend it together (spend it together)
Chasing the stars, endeavour together
And get your team out the Matrix: Nebuchadnezzar
Keep walkin' a line, we walk on an edge
With no fear in our heart, we got a death wish
We on that next shit, they stay thinkin'
In that Blockbuster video mind, we on that Netflix
You're not defined by the dollars you're in debt with
Investments, all the celebrities on your guest list
The profession that you were blessed with
Friendships, or the many that you have sex with
Uh
Take away the money, fame and drugs
And check out how many exit and cherish the ones you're left with
That's why they call it friendship
'Cause one falling out could rock the boat enough and make the rest sink
What defines you is the hurdles that you're met with
The wounds you accumulate and how you go and mend it
You see a child's birth and how they cry and hurt
From this dyin' Earth and how we left it
I feel sorry for the next generation of kids
And the state of society that they're left with
'Cause we're literally slaves of the digital age
Instead of sayin' what we think we just text it
What kind of message is that sending?
Instead of stepping to our problems we're pretending
Instead of ownin' our mistakes we get defensive
We can't even talk these days without offending

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking in the mirror
Looking in the rearview
Watch should I admit to?
[?]

[Chorus]
Admit that I am evil
Admit that I'm deceitful
Admit that I am me
Admit that I am me
