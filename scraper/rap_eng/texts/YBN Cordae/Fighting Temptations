[Intro]
I don't think they ready for this one
I come from the gutter
It's that country shit man

[Verse 1]
I came from the gutter, the bottom
The fuck is the problem? It's always trouble in Gotham
If he stutter, they robbin', we catch the shuttle to Harlem
Makin' plays like huddles, it's no rebuttals, they solid
The code from the OGs, the Jordan, the Kobes
I be studying game, get the score from the nosebleeds
When you tourin', exploding, its more important than voting
Little niggas getting killed and now we forced to be toting
Cuz I done lost some lil' homies, couple cousins, it's crazy
A lil' brother straight bustin', now he stuck with a baby
And he like fuck it it's gravy, it's just another occasion
Was some luck that gone save him, but shit he stuck on probation

[Chorus]
And it's just another day in the life
When you raised in the trife
Now I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions
Lay awake in the night
Gotta pray to get right
In the shade gettin' high like I had to get it

[Verse 2]
Made a couple transactions, felt fantastic
That retail therapy is just a scam tactic
A new wave of new slaves to the brand package
Boy my gas be supreme, not a damn jacket
I ran rapid, sheep niggas with lamb habits
College kids doin' xans, acid, and cram classes
Procrastinate on exam passes and slam asses
Fast forward, my fans massive, my plans mastered
Speakin' from experience, I seen from these lames
Your potential isn't tapped, where will it even begin
My whole team gon' be eatin', don't mind feedin' my friends
Cuz dog, I'd rather be in meetings, fuck tweetin' a trend
On the outside strong but I'm bleedin' within
I know you tired of all the cryin' and the grievin' the sin
God gave LeBron height and blessed me with a pen
A real nigga but most of all, a leader of men

[Chorus]
And it's just another day in the life
When you raised in the trife
Now I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions
Lay awake in the night
Gotta pray to get right
In the shade gettin' high like I had to get it
