[Pre Chorus: Cordae]
Not stepping out
Walk walk ohhh
Walk walk walk
Walk walk walk

[Chorus: Cordae]
Not going out tonight, I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs, it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside, I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help, this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone
I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here
Don't wanna show all my tears
'Cause I'm down, down, down
I'm tired of going down, down, down

[Verse 1: Cordae]
Hold on, ay when I hop up outta my sleep
I just be feeling so weak
Stress coming from my head to my feet
Everyday I'm moody that's how i be
But I switch mood swings, onto some new things
Cute face and dem blue jeans
She left I ain't trippin' no shoe strings
Everyday we all lose dreams
But you gotta catch it, everyday life living reckless
Eating disaster for breakfast
Bad decisions damn that shit is my preference
Turn a bag, now a nigga been stressin'
But its all self inflicted, mad 'cause I failed to listen
20/20 bro the vision, with bail decisions
Never jail or prison
Thank god I'm compelled with wisdom
'Cause when that peer pressure hit ya, I'm a miraculous nigga
I'd rather rap to get richer
I thank my pastor for scriptures
They photosnappin with pictures
Mixed with the pack and the liquor
Then the disaster is quicker
And they blasting with triggers

[Chorus: Cordae]
Not going out tonight, I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs, it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside, I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help, this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone
I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here
Don't wanna show all my tears
'Cause I'm down, down, down
I'm tired of going down, down, down

[Verse 2: Adrian Stresow]
Yeah, yeah
I've been trynna get my paper up
And get famous enough that I don't have to pay for stuff
I've been so stressed low-key staying up
The life I live I couldn't make it up
And my phone on silent, I've been hidin
They want me to call, but I been on an island
And all thats on my mind is how am I to find the way I'm tryin
Ayye I'm sick of all these hoes, I'm sick of all the highs and the lows
Nowadays I don't know everytime, I go I don't wanna be home
And I know girls just wanna have fun
And I just wanna have funds
So I stay to myself and I don't never talk to no one

[Chorus: Cordae]
Not going out tonight, I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs, it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside, I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help, this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone
I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here
Don't wanna show all my tears
'Cause I'm down, down, down
I'm tired of going down, down, down
