[Intro]
Yeah, uh
I said I think I do better
That I think I do better

[Verse]
What is life without love? What's life without dreams?
What's life without goals? Everything ain't what it seems
What's life without friends who remain genuine?
Don't care about the money or what type of crib you in
Who can withstand the test of time? As it's a guess of mine
Here in real life homie, this is not a set design
Not on TV screens or the magazine covers
Sitting and observing as the travesty flutters
Why we gotta beef shit, I'd rather be brothers
Trips to Tokyo with some Japanese lovers
Lost boy in this world full of hatred and greed
See a young nigga make it what they hating to see
Never complacent I be on the chase for the cream
Cash rules everything but you facing a king
Let's step up to this parliament, every fucking bar legit
I know you in denial like an alcoholic father is
Hold up let me pause a bit, nobody is as raw as this
Word to Jesus Christ I hope nobody ever cross the kid
Damn, yes men of the main Judas
But I will remain as true as my problems I aim through it
This that thought-provoking that leave you lost and hopin'
Voices in my head be lying so my heart has spoken
Rap niggas far from potent, they just out here saying random shit
Had to drop a classic 'cause I heard they was demanding it
Anxiety is damaging, but what's the pressure?
Make that shit that's from the soul but with a touch of effort
Nothing lesser; real love, it ain't nothing better
I swear I need that real love, it ain't nothing better
See what's life without purpose? What's life without verses?
Lost boy in this shit, what's life without churches?
What's life without belief? What's life without goals?
What's life without me? What's me without soul?
My God

[Outro]
I said I think I do better
I said I think I do better
