I swear hate you but I love you the same
You help ease my troubles help me go through the pain
And if it were not for you I'd be goin insane
But for real you need to stay in your lane
I mean I love so much I be eyeing you out
And when my lips touch yours I fly high in the clouds
And you always wake the neighbors baby you just to loud
But you always calm me down that's why I keep around
But it's time for change where our paths will criss cross
You made me fail that drug test baby I'm pissed off conservative big boss
You know my persona
Why you always on my sack girl that is a honor
I mean I'm gon off the ganja
Girl you powers are magical
And the statement that I'm leavin you is honestly laughable they different view you show you me of the world is impractical
Cause honestly exposure is a trait I'm attracted to
But a change is needed and you know it's truth
But becausethat's the one thing that's more potent than you
Member when we was alone
And I would flow in the booth
The inspiration you gave it made show and improve
And for that I'm so thankful, and you know that grateful
And if everyone tried the world wouldn't be hateful
But you got your own faults it ain't no lying at sin
You fuckin up my community kids try you at 10
Now let's try this again 2nd time we round the troops
Your impact is amazing ppl die for a ounce of you
You even make em try a hash tag but I'm pounding you
But damn the way you the make us go crazy astounding boo but you always got benefits
You making my niggas rich
And quite a few go to jail for you so you split in it
Member days we'd be getting kicking it
We'd be watching the stars line
You even let start to sell you out through the hard times
Never let me go broke
I kept bread in my pocket
So i stop the using you and I used you profit
And for that I'm so sorry was no reason for shopping you
I kept believe I pimped my main girl to a prostitute
But you make niggas rob and shoot
And you ended a block or 2
And you limit potential you make me wonder what I could do you make some grow addicted so it ain't nomo stopping through
Cause me in blowing in this rap shit is not optional
So girl we threw
Sorry I got to do this
And if I choose it you know my choice is the music
So I'm saying goodbye you just apart of my old life
I knew for a cpl years knew rap for my whole life
