[Intro]
You make me feel, baby, baby
You make me feel, baby

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
You make me feel like I never ever felt before
So what's the deal? Never answer when I’m at your door
I got the juice, I'm surprised you haven't heard by now
So what to do? Got the foreign, we can cruise the town

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin’ boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off
Hit the gas on 'em, leave 'em lost
Blow a bag on 'em, what it cost?
Pull them racks out now they lookin' lost
Two arms up, flex on 'em
You do it easy, you don't gotta break a sweat on em

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
This a mild summer, need new crib, a house hunter
I’m a wild gunner, she go long like route runners
If your spouse wonder, she come to us, a clout gunk
All over with, I promise you that your trial done up
So get back, hit that, gave me whiplash
Get cash, flip packs ’til your wrist crack
'Cause I know you know just what we like
So anything can happen for the night

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin’ boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off
Hit the gas on 'em, leave 'em lost
Blow a bag on ’em, what it cost?
Pull them racks out now they lookin' lost
Two arms up, flex on 'em
You do it easy, you don't gotta break a sweat on em

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Gucci shades, you don't let 'em see your eyes
You tired of niggas, they keep tellin' you these lies
Red bottoms in the European size
Bought you a watch for your birthday surprise
Don't mind your friends, all they do is criticize
Dick up in her stomach, now she got butterflies
Matte black Lamb and the doors suicide
Might get down on one knee, hold up, bitch... I lied

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin' boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off
Hit the gas on 'em, leave 'em lost
Blow a bag on 'em, what it cost?
Pull them racks out now they lookin' lost
Two arms up, flex on 'em
You do it easy, you don't gotta break a sweat on em

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh
