Verse 1:
Now let me tell you bout this rap nigga who would never blow
He got all the Fucking talent yea the kid is hella dope
Couldn't see through all phoneys should've bought a telescope he was aiming too high so he had to settle low
Shopping label after label
Never signed him a deal
So retarded couldn't find the appeal
Didn't matter bout the work or how he rhyming with skills
Just another young nigga tryna grind for the bills
I mean I never was too tall or skilled to go shoot ball
I know i'm a move far
But dammit it's too hard
Imagined if you starved
But dreaming of shoes cars
And everyone around you is just wishing that you'd fall
But nah I refuse see a nigga came to carry a mission
People all from different places come with varied intentions
I'm a great and I knew that from the very beginning
But barely ambitious
Not to mention the larry I'm piffin
Ain't no friends people wanna you buried or prison
Me and all these others man it's scary the difference
I'm too ahead
Plus I alway kill tracks and I shoot em dead
The difference is blue and red
And I never salute the Fed
Cause the system so corrupt they just after the loot and bread I rather just lose my head
Think shay would pastor do instead
My guidance when I'm arriving
Through all of the flashing lights and
Love for the passion writing
But dying a crashing Viking

Hook
They never love you forreal- keep it subtle and chill- on my way to top about the bundles and mills- oh how what a wonderful feeling

Verse 2:
I'm thinking back to into time before my life was obsene
At times I be the only enemy just fighting my dreams
This rap shit is whole my life it's like a pipe to a fiend
Or better no metaphor it's like a mic to a me
I Reminisce my childhood and I ride my bike in the street
And we go straight to Marcus he get to slicing a beat
And we in school till 2
But shit was writing by 3
But that was back when it was fun it was enticing at least
And then I almost lost it all and used to cry in my sleep
And lay awake And always pray something the righteous could beat
Take me back to the days when I used to work at the mall
Take me back when I wasn't perfect at all
And when you climbing from the bottom it never hurts when you fall
Got some problems I been hiding but I'm working to solve
Don't let me blow and realize it wasn't worth the recalls
Lay a verse and into the earth and pop a perk till I'm off

Hook
They never love you forreal- keep it subtle and chill- on my way to top about the bundles and mills- oh how what a wonderful feeling
