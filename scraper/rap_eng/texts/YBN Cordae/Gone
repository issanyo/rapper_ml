[verse 1]
Need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just looking where My grandmama stay at
Graduating school see the debt I gotta pay backing
My money looking rocky I need some more of it ASAP
So Here's the tape all a nigga fucking working on
That's all my verses long
Cause the hurt is strong
I told I was the greatest and not word was wrong
I'm was searching For my purpose
And I murders songs
What's the verdict
Minds lurking that's the herb I'm on
Everybody call my line with alerted tones
Rappers don't want beef eat a ceralion
What's at steak (stake) is my fate
And my verbal thrown
No pun intended
A nigga I was born a run this business
Account balance is always sayin my funds suspended
I'm Tryna buy a beach invited tons of women
Dive in the water slidr ain't no fun in swimming
You should know they from exotic places
Black and white girls man I'm not a racist
Future house so big couldn't find the basement
All Tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Presently these goals is just manifested
Cause rn pockets is anerexic
People hating on the grind and I can't respect it
Gotta vision for the future damn my plans is hectic

[verse 2]
I bring heat to winter
Roll my sleeve when I enter
Blow trees eat dinner
Beg plead to a winner
Not needing a damn thang
Y'all popping champagne
I start a campaign
Can't stop a rampage
Man I go off
Fa sho boss
Y'all so soft
And I underrated and undefeated got no loss
Im colder than February and snow with 11 flurries but my life's in a golden state like I'm Stephen curry
I told momma I'm blowing up so she never worry
And to the haters that's plotting on me be dead and buried
My second tape
I elevate
See better days
Forever paid
I'm here now y'all never stay
A real nigga
No hillfiger my bills bigger
The same people that chill witcha
Will kill quicker
I seen it happen
Hurricanes and fema laughing
A leader passing
Say nothing a just feed the madness
The a bleeding passion metaphors for me with rapping
Hip hop is so dead just clean the ashes
The sweetest fashion
Man I'm flyer than 3 Aladins
On the carpet with a jasmine she the baddest
