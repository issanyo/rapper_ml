[verse 1]
I come from a different breed got a different approach
Cause what's life without grind and you living for hope
But man these be like 9 and they hitting the dope
So we fall in da plan they consider us jokes
These all true facts but you knew dat
I mean I flew back
To city to drop a new track
I'm so anxious
But the listeners they be so brainless
So keep your stupid ass opinion up yo anus
You get the method
They catching bullets like interceptions
RIP KING STEELO man this shit a lesson
Cause kids don't play tag they got a smith an western
They quick to shoot your ass up if you disrespecting
Crips, bloods, and pyru's
Pull up with 5 dudes
Come snatch your fly shoes
Reminisce high school
I've never been to one to hideaway confrontation
Especially from these bum rappers who not as patient
Amazing that they blow up my time a come soon
We different like ying yang or the Sun moon
Bragging bought your cheap chains like you dumb coon
White folks mad see our posters on his son room
And we got them so scared
We compelling the youth
They attracted to my music cause I'm telling the truth
Roomate saying nigga nobody better than you
I swear he never lied cause we move like a veteran move and


[verse 2]
I never hideaway from pressure I'm never afraid
I can't wait for the years where I'm better than Jay
And I'm talking bout accounts I'll have cheddar for days
Flippin stocks show them niggas I'm clever with ways
Will flip a beat
Till its misery
This shit is history
That's word to legend Tye Tribett I got the victory
Your shit is weak
That's a known fact no mystery
I blow up and shonuff it's meant to be
Visions of future
I'm timid with Luther
Nailing notes to my wall
Fuck we posing and ball
All this explosion I caused
How Cause the emotion raw
Feds is imposing the law
Killing us choking us all
Now they unloading the dogs
Tempers is rising
Oh you dun started soothing
You know niggas be violent
You done gave us reason
Now we major we bleeding
On the crip of the evening
Come equipped with a deacon
Because prayer is needed
They got a layer defeated
But we just busting through
Nigga that's up to you
I learn knowledge through experience we say fuck the schools
I pop a pill like I'm bill but I'm no Huxtable but I'll never run away nigga
