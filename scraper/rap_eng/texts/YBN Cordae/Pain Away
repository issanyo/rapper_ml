[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood, we gon' spark that shit up
It's gon' take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past, my brothers they passed
Pray my life it won't fade away
Spend a few bands on my drip, look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist, it cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Niggas gon' hate cause we up now
We throw a party, that shit gon' get shut down
The people that's talking that mess gon' be broke
So why do they still take the bus 'round
I had to spice up my lifestyle
Tell my momma that I gotta shine now
My brother got booked for a minute
So I had to go and make grand mama real proud
So I'm stuck in these streets
Even with all this money I still keep my heat
I'll leave you dead in yo' seat
If you thinkin' 'bout killin' then takin' from me
Body bag, whippin' a four door
Man these niggas they really don't want smoke
Never switch on my bros that's the bro code
For all of my brothers go loco

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood, we gon' spark that shit up
It's gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past, my brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip, look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist, it cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit
Told my bro roll a wood, we gon' spark that shit up
It's gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past, my brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip, look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist, it cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit

[Verse 2: YBN Cordae]
Only the real can stand with us
Stressing, I'm smoking on cannabis
Just made a trip to Los Angeles
It's funny, man, I used to lay on the bus
Enough now, this game is so crazy
It made me not know who to trust now
And we shinin', Nahmir copped the bustdown
Then we grinding we not letting up now
'Cause we know this shit meant to be
And this stress got me fucking up mentally
And just like my lil' brother
I witnessed my mother she crying
He gone for a century
And that fucked up my mental
Feeling revengeful
Nigga just check my credentials
Shit that I been through
Damn, it made my life so eventful
Shit, it's a cycle like menstrual

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood, we gon' spark that shit up
It gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past, my brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip, look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist, it cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit
Told my bro roll a wood, we gon' spark that shit up
It gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past, my brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip, look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist, it cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit
