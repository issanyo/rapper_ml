[verse 1]
I knew that life has its wonder i merely have to explore
You ever give you someone your all and they still asking for more
You ever witness all your dreams fucking crash through the door
You ever have a open mind about until it blast through the floor
But but I won't give my up hope
The shit all that I got
Respect to ones who would love whether I'm balling or not
Cause when you fall from the tops- dog it's a hella of a crash ignore the haters and doubters with they irreverent ass
Man I just wanna make music
Like fuck the cheddar and cash
Cause it won't bring me to piece
And money never would last
I mean I'm better than that
I mean it shouldn't have changed
And I can't wait to break out and put my foot in the game
And tell them all about the song and won't mention your name


[verse 2]
I heard the cage bird sing and it's a beautiful sound
But it so be much damn better girl if you was around
And I see you still got a man
But damn dude is clown
I'm sorry that I had to look, I heard you flew through the town
Bet shit I settle for less
Damn I'm never the best
Cause the only thing that really last forever is death
Go and shoot  a couple videos wear sweaters and vest
Just to show them that I'm different and I'm clever as chest
But honestly I'm the greatest and I'll dare to admit it
But others disagree  if talent don't compare with the the digits but money don't mean shit if you can't share with your niggas we all eat if I eat that's something rare with these niggas
I mean why squeeze on the paper you can't take it with you
And buying shit a stress relive and I'm facing issues-  you know doing right something when the hate official
But please baby pay attention cause I cause pray they miss you


[verse 3]
It's always sunshine after the rain
And it's a some crying laughter and pain
And I don't know how to prepare for the disaster and fame
Who I go to for guidance cause the pastor the same
I hate the struggle and mostly just how shitty it feels
And momma Car got stolen twice got round hickory hills we was catching the bus, but never a missing a meal
But I appreciate the time it made a nigga for real
Moved to the burbs necessary bettered the living
It was a wonderful choice
And I don't regret the decision
Plus I made some great friends that I'm never forgetting
I got a love for the music but the pleasure is missing
Don't appreciate art they never treasure the vision
But i still beat the odds
I'm not dead or in prison
So I'm grateful for the days and I'm not in debt to the system play the song and just pledge to the rhythm
Cause baby we going far
