[Verse]
I need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just look at where my grandmomma stay at
Graduated school, see the debt I gotta pay back
Money getting rocky, I need some more of that ASAP
So where the tape all the nigga working on
That's why all my verses long cause the hurt is strong
I told them I was the greatest and not a word was wrong
I was searching for my purpose and I murdered souls
What's the verdict? Mind's lurking, that's the hurt I'm on
Rappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin
What's that steak in my fate in my verbal throne
No pun intended, a nigga was born to run the business
Account balances always tellin me my funds is spending
Tryna have a beach house, invite tons of women
Dive in a water slide, ain't no fun in swimming
And you know they from exotic places
Black and white girls, man I'm not a racist
A house so big couldn't find a basement
We tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Previously these goals is just manifested
Cause right now my pockets looking anorexic
Got a vision for my future that my plans are hectic
Nigga, mass appeal
