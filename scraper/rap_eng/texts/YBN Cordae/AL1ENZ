Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Denzel Curry]
[?]
Damn, this shit hard
This on Logix man? (G-way)
Day-Daytrip took it to 10
Hey

[Chorus: Denzel Curry & YBN Cordae]
Me and YBN, we be some aliens
I'ma take your bitch and then I peel off like potato skins
If I slay your girl, it's a must I gotta slay her friend
Bitch, I be a player, then that means I gotta play her friend
Me and fucking Curry
[?]
I jump inside the pussy like a god damn Kakuja

[Verse: YBN Cordae]
I made a song, it got a ratchet feel
None of these rappers ill
360, you got a half a deal
Soft as a daffodil
Young nigga, I got the master skill
Living in lavish hills
Gangster, I got the mass appeal

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
[?]
And a nigga move rocks just like tectonics
Plates, bitch

[Bridge: YBN Cordae]
Great shit
Shapeshift my old bitch because that hoe was basic
No ass, fake tits
Facelift, gracious
Then I leave that hoe and then I peel off in my spaceship

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Me in the booth 'fore I drop too hard
Say the Lord of the Rings, lookin' like two towers
And a nigga too clean, like I took four showers
Never know what I say, feelin' like boom-pow
I'm a South Florida nigga, but I'm not from Broward
Everything is gonna slap, but I might need powder

[Verse: YBN Cardoe]
Dunkin' on a nigga like I'm Dwight Howard
Run a nigga over like 10 high towers
