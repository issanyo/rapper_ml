I got them hits like I'm Derek Jeter
Only smoking in the rarest reefer
Got a girl man I dare to meet her
Producers hat  me always I tear they beat up-member days never rock designer
Now a nigga only shop for finer
Catch me eating at hottest diners
Man that boy entendre is finest rhymer
I'm going back to my old Ways
Don't fuck with haters cause they so fake
My girl tripping I go OJ
Squad pimpin we the Coldplay
We all home ain't no free squad
Catch us riding in a speed car
Lil dev popped 3 bars- and you know we all laced in G Star
Soon gang be Giuseppe stepping
So I never do the heavy stressing
I swear  my mind is a deadly weapon
And Use it just about it every lesson
Im on the grind and I'm getting bigger
Why they watching damn these niggas bitter
I hit the stu and you hit the Twitter
Do something that'll get you richer
Never been a hater
I'm a innovator
Girl I'll penetrative ya in a minute
Moving weight that's the fitness
Nigga hate on some bitch shit
