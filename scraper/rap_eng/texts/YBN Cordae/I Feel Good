[verse 1]
I'm feeling good today
Top down roof missing in hood today
To the party ain't no way that I wouldn't stay
So happy fuck niggas just couldn't hate
Damn how the fuck I'm so full of joy- got problems most people hope would avoid
But I'm chilling real hard at ocean views
Even though a most a nigga bills overdue
Don't give a fuck dawg I cop more clothes and shoes
Wearing fly shit that most bad hoes would choose
Took his girl now this nigga bouta blow a fuse
I out even take it serious I'm so amused
Why stress over life it's a beautiful day
Not to mention God blessed with my musical ways
Always have  good energy the Buddha would say
Cause most problems escalade uprooted from hate


[Chorus]
Problems solved I feel today
No stress no strain I cuz feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today
