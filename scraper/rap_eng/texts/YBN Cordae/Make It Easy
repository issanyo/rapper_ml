All I ever wanted
(x12)


This for the ones never heard of me
I kill a track and I murder beats
Gotta fix up the game that's the surgery
On the pac I be geeking like Urkle be
Got that gas boy I'm smoking on purple tree
Nigga I spit that fire to 3rd to degree
All these rapper be liars they purpin b
I stay humble and kill it that's word to Reek
I spit that raw shit
You should be causious
Flow is sick leave it you nautious
I do this often
You niggas soften
Lyrics puttem in coffin
Hit them like I'm Kenny lifton
Run the game niggas crawling
My bank be calling me artist
Cause all I'm doing is withdrawing
Hit the plug lemme hold a pound
He just front me cause he know the sound
My brovas good no one broke around
A nigga crazy then it's going down
Fuck the violence this the last time
I don't fuck black on black crime
I be feeling bad bros blast nines
So my karma coming this a bad sign

I switch the style and I make it easy
I change my friends because they was greedy
(x2)

All I wanted
(x6)

Codeine crazy got me lazy
Bitches that wouldn't fade me
Want my baby
Couple years I be pushin that Mercedes
Free lil bro used fuck with em daily
Now I be blowing dope in the club
I used shovel snow for the dub
Y'all still go to hoes for a hug
I just notice bros showing love

And that's
