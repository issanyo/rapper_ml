[verse 1]

My whole life for hours I been writing convictions
Temptation to striking a Christian
While he fighting position
Almighty forgiven, while looking for a righteous religion
Hopefully getting my people out of lightest positions
And then, one that maybe don't have cost a dime or cent
Where I gotta pay tithe to hear common sense
Rhyming since, like a god and shit in my consciousness
Some say he insane and I'm just out of it
Cause wack rappers that's ass backwards is getting clout
Taking pictures with guns they don't know shit about
It's giving me not the bittest doubt I'm the realest out
They begging me to hear him out cus' they fear me now
Why try to act hardcore or hard for
They hopping that I break a leg no Paul George I'm so fly that I sky walk like Star Wars
Push so hard For Waldorf then fall forward

[Chorus]

I mean in actuality we all stuck in a frame
Can't get out so we just busted in chains
And all these rap niggas straight frontin for fame
Stupid that they think it's something to gain
(Background) Welcome to the Jungle, the jungle the muthafuckin jungle YEA !

[verse 2]

To all you fuck niggas who bust triggas, wassup witcha
Kill ya own kind and reading corrupt scriptures
See the through the light despite the rough picture
And spoke to the death and kept the tough figure cause nowadays they doing madness shit the cops shoot the blackest kid and claim it was accident
Then they wonder why we tired of the cops they riding the block next thin you know roger got shot
No Coincidence horrific shit
I'm tired  I'm sick of this
Ironcally no witnesses
Was written in genesis
Even TV dawg it's all mind control
Rather have designer clothes
Then honor roll
All worthless new slaves to Michael Kors purses
Led by corrupt leaders and false churches
Healed by my sharp flows and raw verses
Not one to judge though I'm far perfect

[Chorus]

I mean in actuality we all stuck in a frame
Can't get out so we just bested in chains
And all these rapper niggas straight frontin for fame
Stupid that they think it's something to gain
(Background) Welcome to the jungle, the jungle the motherfuckin jungle YEA !

[verse 3]

See you gotta grip the steel have dribble skills or get a deal
I chose option number 3 cause my shit appeals
Got everybody respect because this niggas real
See we gotta diet better eating shitty meals
I guess Afro American starter pack is jail time high cholesterol then a heart attack
The harder facts
Is that lying is just apart of rap
Cold bastard, dope rapper
And artifact
