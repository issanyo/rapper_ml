[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
Uh, okay I'm the type to come in the game and just launch pain
With LeBron's frame and a tattoo of my mom's name
This industry has nothin' to offer beyond fame
Time to take these niggas to school like LeBron James
Lesson 1: I'm a bad teacher who give the class seizures
I smash divas, stash reefer in the lab freezer
Know I'ma get mine, troll rappers with shit rhymes
Flowin' like I'm ten feet tall, you just 6'9
Chill, that's a height reference and money is my preference
Dollars, I'ma get it abundantly, that's a high blessin'
Know these rap niggas can't stomach me, try digestion
Seein' Kapernick wearin' Nike, that's how I'm dressin'
Instagram models have a massive disorder
Can't find a real job, you was cappin', I caught up
Prolly look at North West like a Kardashian daughter
Gettin' fucked like little boys with a Catholic father

[Verse 2: Tobe Nwigwe]
Pimp hand strong, watch how I back slap the track
Where I'm from it's heavy metal like Black Sabbath is back
And they pack ratchets, strapped like backpackers with gats
And they make it hard to breathe like bad asthma attacks (Huh)
Breathe easy, I'm heaven sent
My etiquette is eloquent to the desolate
Hell my rhetoric is benevolent and take precedence
Over these candy cane rappers who sweet as peppermints
Ugh, unless you got a sweet tooth
Seek who never would lead you to folk who are deceitful
I'd rather feed you a flow that's healthy for you
But at the same time nastier than beet juice, ugh
Sip it slow, sip it slow
I give Fat love, she give it back, quid pro quo
That means you give something expecting something in return
Boppers yell "Tobe, we love you" I say "let it burn"
Word to Usher and every form of indigestion
I been professin' what a blessin' it is to make connection
With someone who's reflection shows the affection of the spirit
Lowkey should hop on my high horse and Paul Revere it
Not 'cause the British are comin', but just to prepare a woman
Who thinks the man she seduces with her looseness is comin'
Over for more than top and box
If you think he is you dumber than a pot of rocks
The fish you catch depend solely on the bait
Wait, can't let every fishing rod in yo' lake
Shake the Devil off, cut the head off the snake
Swear the serpent's whole purpose is to make sure you can't relate
To truth, salute, the dude who proves
With couth, it's cool to use the hue
On you, they view as poo, it's proof
That this sun kissed melanin really is the doo doo
Wipe me down

[Verse 3: DUCKWRTH]
Well since this is my introduction to the world
Hello I am DUCKWRTH comin' straight up out the 'burbs
I'm just kidding, South Central raised me since a kiddie
Bounced a couple places, now I'm back up in my city
Big stackin', main attraction, just a bouncin' in my city
It's that big W with the rest of my committee
Last year I signed a deal but somehow I keep it indy
Prolly 'cause I don't dependy on a writer or a cosigner
Big timer, go 'head and hop up off the titty
The world's run dry and you been thirsty since a milli
Now it's two thousand and the one eight
Thought Hilary had the victory, but Trump hit the pump fake
But honestly if I could spit a fact right now
Damn it feels good to be black right now
Everybody wanna rap, they wanna rap right now
They wanna feel the essence, glow, fat ass right now
But collagen ain't sponsoring the answers to your confidence
So give it up like Ramadan, that's including the condiments
Pick your jaw up, I like it better when you talkative
Your bottom lip is bottomless, I'll tie it to a rocket ship
I'm gone

[Verse 4: Blocboy JB]
Ooh, I'ma slice a nigga like a pool
I was in the school, we were breakin' plenty rules
I'ma hit a nigga, he just stick like cool
Ridin' on [?], know she fuckin' on the crew
Ice on my neck and you know it's frozen
What's in my mouth, bitch you know it's golden
Every time I keep it packed like it was frozen
Ridin' with my niggas and you know them niggas holdin'
Put that in the back, whole lot of shot
Who that in the back? A whole lot of op
Late night, we was creepin', we gon' make some shit pop
Ridin' with my niggas 'til the day I die though
I'm insured baby you can call me Geico
Ay, I'ma heat a nigga like some [?]
This some beef, oh [?]
We gon' ride with the heat, oh, know I'm gon' tuck it
Got the [?] eat the people and you know she fuckin'
I'm a real nigga, I ain't never been no lame
Ooh, yeah, check the shine
Ooh, 2018, bitch is mine
