Watch how I flex like woah
Noah Boat I am the goat
Ferragamo on my toe
That's fifteen hunnid' on my toes
Spent my money now I'm broke
Money funny you a joke
Pockets hurting on D Rose
Pockets hurting like D Rose

Pull up crashing in a porche
Pull up crashing in a porche
Pull up crashing in a porche
Spent my money now I'm poor

You will not see me on forbes
But didn't get punched on my tour
Girl you getting X'd out
None of my money is yours

All i do is smoke purp
Don't pop the xans or the perc
(Don't do it)
No Rihanna whippin' work
G-Star on my shirt
But 8 dollas' on my wrist
Yeah my jewerly cheap as dirt
Yeah my phone never poppin
I dont ever get alerts

All about benjamins
Livin' in tenements
Dead broke and it don't got no benefits
I just need a Little Pump like adrenaline
Yeah my girl bad and she tasting like cinnamon
Breaking borders like a illegal citizen
When im rappin why y'all call me illiterate
Special needs you should be more considerate
16 I'm a badass degenerate (aye)

Watch how I flex like woah
Noah boat I am the goat
Ferragamo on my toe
That's fifteen hunnid' on my toes

Went to neimans copped margielas
But bank account said "No"
Swiped my card at the gucci
It declined said "No"

Extended clip on the canon
Wild N' Out Nick Canon
Killing beats doing damage
It's Noah Boat don't panic

Just did a couple of shows
But I didn't get jumped
All my men got the gas
They just need a little pump

Love Live Serve
Bustin swerves
