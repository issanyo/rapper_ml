[Intro: Andy Samberg & Adam Levine]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk
Yeah

[Chorus 1: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Uh, you only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas
And never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste

[Hook 2: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!

[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

[Bridge: All]
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

[Outro: Andy]
You oughta look out
