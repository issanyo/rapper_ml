Well I'm a hustler, that's just what I do
I'm always hustling on the avenue
I can sell water to a whale
Or even a shell to a snail

I'm a hustler, life of a hustler, that's me
I've been this way since I came out my mama's puss
I'm always thinking of a scheme
I'm good at what I do
And I know a thing or two about hustling

You have to be born with a certain swag
A je ne sais quoi, that makes hustling your bag
Hey, at 8 years old I got my hood pass
Then at 9 I got my first piece of ass

Ice to an eskimo, spaghetti to a wop
I know that sounds racist, it's just how I talk
In the crap game, I am the number 1
I wouldn't mess around, you'll get your money taken

(Jumbled)
Never talk on the phone, that’s rule number one, I'll punch you in the spine
So many rhymes on my brain, sometimes I feel insane
I’m in the kitchen, cooking up crack
(Laughing) So anyway, that’s probably uncool, right?
