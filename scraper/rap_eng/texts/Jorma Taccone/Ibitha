Dedicated to the people of Espa√±a

There's a party tonight in Ibitha
We're gonna dance and eat pizza
Zesty, spicy, tasty, and lifely
Super sexy, not sexy slightly
Everyone is showing skin
DJ, let the record spin

In Ibitha-tha-tha-tha
Every day the fiesta-sta-sta-sta
Speakers boom on the dance floor-floor-floor
Everyone is a star-star-star

Our tummies are full of Paella
Here's a recipe of the Paella
Steamy broth sweet peas and lobsters
Tonight we eat like the conquistadors

There's a place far away making lots of noise
Where the boys are girls and the girls are boys
The vibes are full of love and peace
And people sound like they got their gap in their teeth
But they don't
