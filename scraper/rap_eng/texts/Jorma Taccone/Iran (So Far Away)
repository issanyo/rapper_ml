[Intro: Andy Samberg]
They say true love comes only once in a lifetime
And even though we're from opposite ends of the earth
My heart tells me you're the one for me
Mahmoud

[Verse 1: Andy]
I remember when it started
Saw you on the news
You were hatin' gays
I was eatin' food
I was feelin' you
And even though I disagree with almost everything you say
You ain't wrong to me
So strong to me
You belong to me
Like a very hairy Jake Gyllenhaal to me
Mahmoud make my heart beat right out of my chest
My mind says no but my body says yes
Nuclear threat, the only threat I see
Is the threat of you not coming home with me
Our love for each other's like when atoms collide
I can't express how I feel
Ey yo Adam, let's ride

[Hook: Adam Levine]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Is your home
But in my heart you'll stay

[Verse 2: Andy]
He ran for the president of Iran
We ran together to a tropical island
My man Mahmoud is known for wilin'
Smilin', if he can still do it then I can
They call you weasel
They say your methods are medieval
You can play the Jews, I can be your Jim Caviezel
S&M, nestlin' when we're wrestlin'
You could be the port that I park my vessel in
So I try to mute the TV but you can still see me
With your sleepy brown eyes
Butter pecan thighs
And your hairy butt
Yeah...

[Hook: Adam]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Come home
And in my arms you'll stay

I used to look at the stars and dream
'Round the world same stars we're seeing
And the twinkle in your eyes, Mahmoud

[Verse 3: Andy]
Talk smooth to me
Without a tie
Your pants high-waisted, damn so fly
We could take a trip to the animal zoo
And laugh at all the funny things that animals do
Like Eugene
You got me straight trippin', boo
Hope you look in my eyes and say "I'm trippin' too"
You say Iran don't have the bomb
But they already do
You should know by now
It's you

[Hook: Adam]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Is your home
But in my heart you'll stay

[Outro: Andy]
You're crazy for this one, Mahmoud
You can deny the Holocaust all you want
But you can't deny that there's something between us
I know you say there's no gays in Iran
But you're in New York now, baby
It's time to stop hiding
And start living
