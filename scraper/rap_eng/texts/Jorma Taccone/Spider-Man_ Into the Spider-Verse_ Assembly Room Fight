INT. PITCH BLACK TUNNEL

Miles shines his light into darkness. This is SCARY. A LONG, BLUE TUBE, stamped ALCHEMAX, arcs into the DISTANCE, HUMMING. Miles’ spider-sense continues to direct him.

Another surge of SPIDER-SENSE hits Miles and we hear competing thoughts in his head.

MILES (V.O.): Slow down!/What am I doing? What am I doing?

Miles picks up the pace, jogs around the corner, where Miles TURNS, a BIG SURGE OF SPIDER-SENSE and multiple voices are heard together.

MILES: Look out./I don’t want to be a hero!/Look out.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE #1: You’re like me.
