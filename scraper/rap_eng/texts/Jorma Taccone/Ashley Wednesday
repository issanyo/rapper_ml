[Verse 1]
I landed in London
At a quarter to noon
So excited to see her
Took a cab to her room
I know she's exquisite
So I had to visit
Pushed my back to the front of the door
And you wouldn't believe what I saw

[Chorus]
Ashley Wednesday
A spectacularly beautiful chick
With impeccable style  and spectacular eyes
When we met, both of our souls clicked  like a plug in a socket
Ashley Wednesday
Oh you hit me like a tonne of bricks
With illuminous hair and your sturdy teeth
I want our hearts to be joined at the hip so to speak

[Verse 2]
I gotta know
What is your stance on marriage?
Girl I really gotta know
Cause we never talk about it
But now I am proposing
Get this girl some diamonds
Please freaking say yes girl
I'm an American man
This is my native land
But for you I'd summer in England
But I will not go to France
On that I take a stand
But I hope you'll take my hand
Both in life and marriage
Step into my carriage
We'll park inside my garage
And live inside my house
As husband and wife
