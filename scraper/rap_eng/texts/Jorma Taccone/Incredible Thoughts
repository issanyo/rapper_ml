[Intro: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts
Incredible minds
I'm so overwhelmed
How did my brain conceive them?

[Verse 1: The Lonely Island]
A snow white dove in the pitch black night
A rain drop falls from tremendous heights
A wave crashes off of a cliff in Scotland
A child bites an apple, but the core is rotten
TV is free, but what is the cost?
We have GPS and yet, we're still lost
A carrot in the desert, a camel in the garden
A man with giant ears begging your pardon
What if a garbage man was actually smart?
A common misconception that we're tearing apart
And to a dog, dog food is just food
And to a sock, a mansion's just a big shoe
A milk dud, sitting in the acid rain
A house cat addicted to the cocaine
No teeth, unlimited floss
These are just a few of our incredible thoughts

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
Too many great ideas inside
It's a miracle my head can contain them
My spectacular brain
For all human kind
Changing how we think about space and time
Now it's time to share them with the people

[Verse 2: The Lonely Island & Michael Bolton & Mr. Fish]
A ballerina waits for the bus
A number one dad trophy covered in rust
An nun dunked a basketball living the impossible
A man breaks his leg inside a hospital
We just thought of that and it can change the world
World like a smart oyster full of pearls
Such as an ultrasound of a new baby
With a Santa hat drawn on, yeah that's my kind of Christmas card
What if a butterfly was made out of butter?
These small thoughts could destroy Big Brother
The world's cutest kittens just hugging a dog
Just one of many of our incredible thoughts
What if one thought could cure the people
What if one song could end all evil
Imagine if a fish could play guitar
And also sing, it would sound bizarre like
My name is Mr. Fish
These guys thoughts have granted my wish
And that may have just changed the course of time
I swear my mind blows my mind, incredible

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
Too many great ideas inside
It's a miracle my head can contain them
My spectacular brain
For all human kind
Changing how we think about space and time
Now it's time to share them with the people, my brain is a genius

[Outro: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts
Incredible minds
I'm so overwhelmed
How did my brain conceive them?
