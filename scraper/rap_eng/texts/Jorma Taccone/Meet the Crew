Lonely Island!
We got the whole family here
Time to meet the crew, Y'all!

My name is Jorm
You can call me J-orgus
Ride around town bumpin' Fugees in a Taurus

Yo, I'm Artemis Prime
Also known as Young Sandwich
The Lonely Island got amigos like my man John Landis

Akiva in the house
But you can call me Young Dad
Rockin' pink Adidas, never wear plaid

I'm little Tony
I'm always playin' pranks
Make you run out the room cause my booty stanks

I'm the fat one
They call me Fat Bob
I get all the ladies even though I'm a slob

I'm Piccolo Pete
And a part of the crew
You'll know that it's me from the sound of my flute

Hell, I'm Sick Eric
I'm always sick
You can catch me on the corner taking antibiotics

They call me Smooth Guy
Cause I be drinkin' mad smoothies
You think I got my name from my voice?
That just ain't true, G

They call me Creepy Zeek
You know I do my own thing
My rhymes ain't good but I'm fun in small doses

They call me Boring Steven
I don't know why
My rhymes are dope and my whip is fly (it's fucking bullshit)

I'm a rich guy
I'm doing this as a lark
My sense of humor is extremely dark

Well I'm new to the crew
And no one trusts me at all
If they'd get to know me they'd see I'm a ball

People call me Tiny
My name is ironic
I'm 12 feet tall. My life is hard

I'm a little lost
Is this the right studio?
I work for Rod Stewart, you know what? I'm gonna go

I wear stripes that match the wallpaper
I'm hiding now but I'll surprise you later

Well, my name is Greg
And I'm on the phone
It was my mom's birthday so I had to fly home

We're the Buddha Twins, all we smoke is Buddha Bless
Never puff sess, Buddha Bless is the best

Hey, I'm Rod Stewart
I'm looking for my tech
He's always wandering off, what a pain in the neck!

So there it is
One third of the crew...
The rest couldn't be here or phone in...
But best believe they are missed
Lonely Island, we out
