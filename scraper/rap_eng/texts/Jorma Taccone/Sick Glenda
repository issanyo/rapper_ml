Glenda I love you, you are my number one pick
But every time I call you, you say that you’re sick
Glenda, are you dying or just avoiding me?
Either way’s a bummer but I hope you’re dying
Glenda, I’m sending the doctor to you (to you!)
And if he finds you well, my heart will break in two (oh!)
Sick Glenda, are you a coward or do you have the flu?
Sick Glenda, sick Glenda, get better or fuck you
