[Intro]
(Scratched Sample): "Came to the party"
(doorbell)
"Hello, welcome to the party"*
"Hi, I've never met you before."
"I know."

[Hook]
Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
(Having a good time, having a good time)
Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
(Having a good time, having a good time)

[Verse 1]
We'll burn the roof off
This party's going off
You think that we're soft?
You get tossed

Guy Number One
I love to dance
My fancy feet moves putting you in a TRANCE

It's a friend thing
Friends are everytwhere!
In the kitchen, the den
Hanging out on the stairs!

Spinach dip
Real hot chicks
Spike the punch and take a sip

Guy Number Two
Come to chill with you
P-A-R-T-WHY ?
Cause we got to!

I like playing games in the pool
Who invited Steve? That dude's a cunt!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now everyone in the house say Guy Number One
("Guy Number One!")
Now everyone in the house say Guy Number Two
("Guy Number Two!")

Dude, quit tripping
You're ruining my high
My loaded gun makes you reach for the sky
There's a knock at the door
Who could that be?
Why won't the cops let our party be?

How would you like to be.. shot?
Me and my friend.. smoke pot
No jocks No jerks
Just fun with girls
Having fun Guy One?
"The most fun in the world!"

[Hook] (2x)

Party over here
Party over here
Party over here
PARTY OVER HERE
