[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, what

[Verse 1]
Rock hard, bitch disregard everything
Anything, anyone, everyone got a gun
So you don't have to tell me shit
Whip out my dick and take a shit
Think I'm not a alien, fuck you trick
I just took a shit (Out my motherfucking dick)
My grandmama is hot it makes me sick
It makes me wanna make out with her and suck on her tits
But that's just me, I'm Hunter the hungry
Rather fuck you cause your girlfriend is fugly
Which in my books if for fun and giggly
Hehe-hehe-hehe
Teepee, teepee where I live
Eat raw meat like the Indians did, bitch

[Hook]
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, fuck your ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, what's up bro

[Verse 2]
Not a god damn thing (x8)
Call friend, ring ding ding ding (Hello?)
I'm the lawnmower man, only more perverted
If you ain't seen that flick then your head is hurting
Fuck your whole team and that horse you rode in on
Seriously the horse looks great (Hunter!)
I wanna fuck right now
Your horse looks great so you better get down (Hunter!)
Song was a hit even though I gave a shit when I wrote it

[Hook]
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, fuck your ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya ho
Hey ya, hey ya, what's up bro
