Turtle neck n' chain
Turtle neck n' chain

[The Lonely Island]
My turtleneck fat and my chain so thin
And I'm sipping light beer, and my crew right here
Chain razor thin light beer in my cup
And my sweater on turtle with the neck on puff
Huge turtle neck and my chain so skinny
Beer light all night, stand up get dizzy
Light cup, beer drink, thin so chain, neck turtle fat, man I won't say it again

Turtle neck (check) with another on deck
In case I spill something on it (Like some light beer?), yeah!
We be bragging about who's chain be the thinnest
Turtle neck thicker than Delta Burke swimmin' in a Guiness (Now bear witness)
But they can't see my chain
Metal so thin it dissolves when it rains
Got more chains than the snow patrol
Everyone razor thin like an insect stripper pole

Chain so light when a breeze roll by, I made it flow (I made it flow)
And my beer so light you could see right through it, like a ghost
And I also wear turtlenecks
Sweaters swallowing my chain like it's stuck in the couch
Looking like cookie monster flossing his mouth
Find me cooling on the corner sipping light beer foam
You can tell by my turtle neck and chain that I bone
Turtleneck, light beer and a thin ass chain, and that's it
Turtleneck, light beer and a thin ass chain, and that's it

[Snoop Dogg]
The rabbit kicked the bucket, dog said fuck it
Get my 2 step on, with my turtle neck on
Thin ass chain, light beer in my glass
Mackin at the bitches, the ones with the ass
Girl you know it's true, tell me what it do
Oh you like my style, say you like my crew
Say you wanna' be under my chest, this turtle neck is like one of my best
Say you wanna' be under my chest, this turtle neck is like one of my best
So I guess your dress, no stress, staying fresh is my vendetta
I'm a crook, so my look, I'm a game go getta
The fatter, the puffier, the fluffier, the bigger the turtleneck
The more gangster it is
