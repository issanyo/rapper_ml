One, two!
One, two, one, two, three

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We're gonna cheer cause we are here
With all of us together, we have nothing to fear
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We're gonna cheer cause we are here
With all of us together, we have nothing to fear

[Verse 1: The Lonely Island]
Now all of the ladies say, "Woo!" (Woo!)
And all of the fellas say, "Crowd!" (Yeah!)
We're drinking beer and doing cheers
Been crowds like us for millions of years
We are all here, we're not at home
As long as we're together, we can't be alone

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
We are a crowd and we are loud
We're cheering as a group at our favorite event
We are not one, we are a ton
There's safety in numbers, so now it is fun

[Verse 2: The Lonely Island and Kiv]
We are a crowd, crowd, crowd
Yes, we are a crowd
And so we shout, shout, shout
Because beer is allowed
And there's no doubt, doubt, doubt
That we're helping out
Because without-out us, there would be no crowd
We are a crowd
