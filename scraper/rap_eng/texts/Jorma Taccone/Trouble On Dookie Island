Yo hopped out the whip,pop the heater out the clubby
Ski masked it up, bout to jack these fools, it's lovely
Blasted through the door blazing hell with the shells flyin
Spiderwebbed the flat screen in one shot, babies crying

Got these bitches nose bloody, face down in the shag
This bitch is flippin-Shut the fuck up and fill the bag
All of a sudden- BOOM, shots from the back room
It was a set up, dude yellin: "get lit up"

Yo we bust out the back, dookie flyin outta my pants
You got the keys, yea boy now make that engine dance
This shit is stallin, fuck man they strapped up
Lets make a brake for it to the crib for the backup
We hit the pavement, dookie bustin all out of my jeans
You hop the fence, so we can get away clean

We hit the dirt, this rottweiler snarlin and smilin
He ripped my pantleg off, a bunch of dookies went flyin
I had to blast, dog brains all in the grass
Mixed with the dookie, yeah man! nighty night! Time to smash

Yo we cut through the park, dookies poppin outta my shirt
A hail bullets from behind, like lead fireworks
Dookie fillin up my sneaks bought to bust, No doubt
Pulled off my Isotoner glove, shook the dookies out

Yo it's The Jakes, they want us to be chased
Yo duck over here, I gotta ditch some dead dookie weight
Whipped off my skully so I could dump the dookie
Cop blazin out the eucalyptus tryin to shoot me
I blew out his back, that's all she wrote man
Yeah, on his chest left two dookies for the boatman

They comin man, quick throw these dookies in the trash
Hold up more dookie, they comin out fast
Yo I can't move my leg, cause I'm stuck on dookie mountain
Fifty guns open fire, blood spray like a fountain
Now our bodies all shredded, shots blaze right through me
We're deader than dust, done in by the dookie
Trouble on Dookie Island
