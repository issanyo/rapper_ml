[Intro: Chester Tam]
Aiyyo fam, check this out
I was just at the club right?
Heard these two dudes talkin'
One of them said to the other one
That they knew someone, who said you guys are WACK!

[Hook]
Who said we're wack? You said we're wack?
You take it back! Who said we're wack?
You talkin' smack? You're gonna get smacked!
(You sayin' that I'm wack, but it just ain't so)

[The Lonely Island]
Someone said we're wack, why would they say that?
I don't think we're wack, who said we're wack?
Who said we're wack? I can't believe that
They must be smokin' crack, to say that we're wack
Say that we're wack, you probably get smacked
If you said we're wack, did you say we're wack?
WHO SAID WE'RE WACK? I'll paint your eye black!
Once I check my facts - who said we're wack?

How could a person up and call a person wack?
How could the devil turn the blue sky black?
How many babies born will never reach their dreams?
And how could a person call another person wack?

I heard a rumor that somebody said we're wack
I think that's wack, to call someone wack
I AM NOT WACK, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
WHAT DID YOU SAY? DID YOU SAY I'M WACK?!

[Outro]
All the ladies in the house put your hands up
All the fellas in the house put your hands up
Now whoever said we're wack put your hand up
Now everyone else, put your hands down
(Oh there he is, there he is!)
