[Intro: Andy & John Waters]
Haha, yeah
Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is the Creep

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
When you’re out at a club and you see a fly girl
Do the Creep (ha)
Do the Creep (ha)
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 1: Andy & Akiva]
Well, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It’s real easy to do and it’s called the Creep
Let your hands flop around, like a marionette
Pop your knees up and down and shakin’ your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood
And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your sneakers, you a certified creeper

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
When you see a country peach laying out at the beach
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep (ooh)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 2: Andy & Akiva]
I was six years old when I started creeping
My parents took it to their room and I started peeping
You can imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed
And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born
Get popping out my momma like some kettle corn
And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking
Cause I came clean and I came out creeping

[Interlude: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]
Nicki (uh), Nicki (uh huh)
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & The Lonely Island]
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and ogling
Little did they know that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And they would dance: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So pop your peepers and squeak out your sneakers
Don’t sleep, come on, get your creep on with me

[Hook: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]
Go on and get you sweating off the bride at her wedding
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
But when you sneak into a wake and you see a beefcake
Do the Creep (ooh)
And do the creep (ha)
When the judge is a hottie and you can’t control your body
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
So get your knees flexin’ and your arms T-Rexin’
And creep, haha (ha)
Do the Creep (ha)

[Outro: John Waters]
And don’t forget to smile
