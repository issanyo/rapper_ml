WE BEGIN ON A COMIC.

The cover asks WHO IS SPIDER-MAN?

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): Alright, let’s do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker.

QUICK CUTS of a BLOND PETER PARKER pulling down his mask...a name tag that reads “Peter Parker”...various shots of Spider-Man IN ACTION.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): I was bitten by a radioactive spider and for ten years I’ve been the one and only Spider-Man. I’m pretty sure you know the rest.

UNCLE BEN tells Peter:

UNCLE BEN (V.O.): With great power comes great responsibility.

Uncle Ben walks into the beyond.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again and again and again...

Spider-Man saves the city, kisses MJ, saves the city some more. The shots evoke ICONIC SPIDER-MAN IMAGES, but each one is subtly different, somehow altered.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): And uh... I did this.

Cut to Spider-Man dancing on the street, exactly like in the movie Spider-Man 3 (2007).

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): We don’t really talk about this.

A THREE PANEL SPLIT SCREEN: shots of Spider-Man’s “products”:

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): Look, I’m a comic book, I’m a cereal, did a Christmas album. I have an excellent theme song. And a so-so popsicle. I mean, I’ve looked worse.

MATCH CUT: Peter, PINNED to a WALL by a mechanical tentacle arm. KINGPIN punches Peter. GREEN GOBLIN fights Peter.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): But after everything, I still love being Spider-Man. I mean, who wouldn’t?

Peter runs toward a SUPER-COLLIDER, something we’ll see quite soon. Peter SLAMMED TO THE GROUND.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): So no matter how many hits I take, I always find a way to come back.

Peter GETS UP... in a shot that we will also remember, RIGHT BEFORE GOBLIN GRABS HIM. The collider EXPLODING, the force of the blast rippling through New York.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.): Because the only thing standing between this city and oblivion is me. There’s only one Spider-Man. And you’re looking at him.

Spider-Man WINKS. Man, he’s cool.
