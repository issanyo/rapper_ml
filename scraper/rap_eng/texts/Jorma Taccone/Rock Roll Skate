[Intro]
Y'all ready for this

[Hook]
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick

[Verse 1]
I got a 40, dog! What you wanna do?
I got my dick hard, yeah we do too
I put a dick in your ear, cock in your minds
Sac-Town represent we came to drop bombs
Rolling with my brothers, pipe bomb shit
Smoking cotton candy with some rain drops in it
Sac-Town president two years straight
Check the yearbook, most likely to penetrate
Cops tryna get me, take me under with the stunner
Pigs you could suck my dick, so take a number

[Hook]
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a bag of shit
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a motherfucking dick
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick
Style Boyz in the house and we gives a fuck
So whip out your nuts and shut the fuck up

[Interlude]
Calling all cars, be on the lookout for three intoxicated young men wearing a Starter jacket, expensive jewelry, Girbaud jeans, and big dicks

[Verse 2]
I'm on the boardwalk, cold eyes of a cougar
Selling devil's rock with a hand on my luger
Kid Brain back to 80 with the ladies
Every fourth girl I mother crush like crazy
My penis, the h-o-t-ness
Girls give me so much brain and I'm a genius
This is that rock-roll music, that cock pole music
So get your face out of my face before I bruise it

[Hook]
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a bag of shit
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a motherfucking dick
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick
Style Boyz in the house and we gives a fuck
So whip out your nuts and shut the fuck up
