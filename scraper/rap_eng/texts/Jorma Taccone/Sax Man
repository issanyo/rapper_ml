The Lonely Island (Ft. Jack Black) â€“ Sax Man

[Jack Black]
Wellllll he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee
First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three...weeks old
And when he blew into that horn all the people gathered 'round
Club manager jumped right up and said "Boy I gotta have that sound!"
Scream "Hallelujah Lord!", I said the Sax Man's got my soul
Everybody gotta move their feet, when the Sax Man started to blow
Now blow it Sax Man!

{*farting saxophone sounds*}

Mmmmmm'kay he's a little shy, but his genius cannot hide
Cause when the Sax Man starts to wail he's gonna take you on a ride
Take it Sax Man!

{*two saxophone notes*}

Ow! Take it Sax Man!
Okay he'll be right with you folks!

All right, Sax Man, that's my fault, I put you on the spot
But now you're all warmed up and this-a next one's gonna be hot
Kick it Sax Man! (C'mon!)

{*one bad note*}

(What the fuck are you doing!!)

{*another bad note*}

Haha, okay! Why don't we have a little inspiration now
You know this game, Sax Man!
Repeat after me
Here we go, and..
Shibbidy bop bop, buda bop bah {*one note*}
Dip dip di-dip, dip dip di-dip dip {*two weak notes*}
Arrip da di-dip, bop ba-doo-doo day-day {*no sound at all*}

Okay, movin on!
