INT. SUPERCOLLIDER ROOM

He is now in an ENORMOUS CHAMBER containing a SUPERCOLLIDER.

MILES: Woah!!

Miles looks around the room, confused.

MILES : What is this place?

Spider-Man and Goblin BURST through doors above him. Miles falls STRAIGHT DOWN, but Spidey spots Miles and swings him safely away, high and far from the action. They are on an OBSERVATION LEDGE overlooking the collider chamber.

A beat as they appraise each other. Then:

SPIDER-MAN: Did you know your shoes are untied?

MILES: Uh huh.

SPIDER-MAN: This is a onesie so I don’t really have to worry about it.

A beat. Spidey senses something in Miles. Their spider-senses RESONATE. Like a mind meld.

SPIDER-MAN: (thrown) I thought I was the only one. You’re like me.

MILES: I don’t want to be.

SPIDER-MAN: I don’t think you have a choice, kiddo. (gently) Got a lot going through your head, I’m sure.

MILES: Yeah...

SPIDER-MAN: You’re gonna be fine. I can help you. If you stick around, I can show you the ropes.

MILES: (so relieved) Yeah.

SPIDER-MAN: I just need to destroy this big machine real quick before the space time continuum collapses. Don’t move. See you in a bit.

IN AN AMAZING, MIND-BOGGLING MOVE, Spidey jumps away and uses the MASSIVE CHURNING SUPERCOLLIDER to WHIP HIMSELF UP until he’s ON THE CEILING, hundreds of yards above, and eyelevel with a CEILING PANEL.

MILES (V.O.): How does he do that?

He RIPS THE PANEL OUT, reaches in, pulling out COMPLICATED WIRING. He pulls a STRANGE COMPUTERIZED KEY out of his suit and tries to plug it INTO A HANGING PORT. Miles watches, IMPRESSED.

Spider-Man tries to put the key in the port, but it’s the wrong side, he flips it around, that’s wrong too somehow.

SPIDER-MAN: I always get this wrong.

As he finally gets it, a SURGE OF SPIDER-SENSE.

SPIDER-MAN: (looks up) Oh boy.

A PURPLE BLUR streaks overhead. TWO PUNCHES from nowhere. Dazed, Spider-Man looks up and sees a lanky opponent in a purple MASK and SUIT wearing mechanized GLOVES and BOOTS. It's THE PROWLER.

As they FLY ACROSS THE ROOM, FIGHTING...

SPIDER-MAN: Prowler! Man, I was in the middle of something!

Prowler THROWS HIM HARD TO THE GROUND.

SPIDER-MAN: (hitting ground) I am so tired...

Prowler lunges towards Spider-Man but Spider-Man expertly dodges the claws and spinning rocket boot kicks.

SPIDER-MAN: Are you mad at me? I feel like you’re mad at me.

Miles watches from down below, helpless. He SNAPS a picture on his cell phone.

SPIDER-MAN: Is that all you got?

The GREEN GOBLIN appears and pins Spider-Man to the ground. His giant blue tongue lashes around angrily, hitting SpiderMan with GIANT GOBS OF SPIT.

SPIDER-MAN: Uhh, so gross.

MILES (V.O./THOUGHT BUBBLES): I should go up there and help him! Who am I kidding, I should not do that.

PRELAP: THE SOUND OF LOUD, DELIBERATE FOOTSTEPS. THE CLICKING OF A PEN.

INT. CONTROL ROOM

TERRIFIED SCIENTISTS work as SOMETHING HUGE walks through the room from behind them.

REVEAL KINGPIN, an elaborately-tailored HULK OF A MAN. He walks through the control room towards the windows that face out over the collider room.

KINGPIN: (creepily singing Spider-Man theme) Dooby do, dooby do. Watch out, here comes the Spider-Man! (then, over a P.A.) You like my new toy? It cost me a fortune. But hey, you can’t take it with you, right? You came all this way. Watch the test. It’s a hell of a freakin’ light show, you’re gonna love this.

SPIDER-MAN: (panicking now) No! No! Don’t do this! Stop! You don’t know what it can do, it’ll kill us all!

The collider ROARS ON, lights MOVING UP THE WALLS toward the top, as it CRESCENDOES WITH-- CLUNK! A TINY ATMOSPHERIC METER in a BOX lowers down, blinking, with a TINNY WHIR...

Spider-Man confused as the SENSOR LOCKS INTO PLACE.

BLAM! The collider behind Spidey ACTIVATES, firing PARTICLE BEAMS at the BOX, which FREAKS OUT, it’s readings ON HAYWIRE. IT’S CRAZY LOOKING.

Kingpin watches, a huge smile. A DREAM COMING TRUE. The scientists are growing EXCITED.
