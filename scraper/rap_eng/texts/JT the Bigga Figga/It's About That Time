[Intro dialogue]

[Verse 1]
One, two, checka, microphone wrecka
And I betcha never thought the Bigga one would catch ya
Feeling the flow, now it's on, roll in a car with DJ Dome
Hat to the back with a gat and a sack, chopping it on a cellular phone
Straight to it, business as usual
Get Low Productions, not the average criminals
Coming from the studio, shit kinda phat
Three ADATs and a 24-track
Peepin' out the scene, laying down my vocals
Got the proper singer straight from Acapulco
Got a show at 8, do my soundcheck at 4
Get the hotel room and fat sack of indo
The Get Low P, man, we just chillin'
Beats and raps from the floor to the ceiling
Trippin', now we on the road again
Packed up the shit and hopped in the van
Hit the highway for a 10-day mission
Pumped up the beat and hit the air condition
Mashin' down the way way, a show day's a payday
Ya heard what I say, you do it my way or no way
So tear off the funds and give us the mic
'Cause tonight's the night to get your ass outta sight
And let me get a fee for what they came here for
They wanna hear me biggedy-bust and riggedy-rhyme hardcore
You better check yourself, 'cause I'ma check my rhyme
Put that ass on the grind, nigga, 'cause it's about that time

[Chorus]
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9
Stuck to me grind, it's about that time
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9

[Verse 2]
Tip toe, tip toe once again but I'm back, bro
Creepin' through the back streets looking for my niggaro
Bankin', gankin', looking for some dank and
Get to the studio because a nigga be making
Hits on top of hits on top of hits
Flip the script once again 'cause you know I don't miss
Here to take what's mine
And to get what's yours
And to bust the floor and to knock down doors
What you mean, what you mean, got your dome on a beam
When the light turn green, close your eyes 'cause I mean
Business, what is this, some type of game
'Cause it ain't no thang when you're truckin' like a train
That's the end of the rhyme, so it's back to the grind
Stayin' strapped with a 9, nigga, 'cause it's about that time

[Chorus]
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9
Stuck to me grind, it's about that time
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9

[Verse 3]
Taking a chance with me Glock 'cause me pop like that
Riggedy-rock riggedy-reggae riggedy-riggedy-riggedy rap
Bustin' a cap, pullin' a jack, puttin' the shit on the map
All the way from the back 'cause you know that it's like that
Check it check it out 'cause I know y'all feel me
The miggedy-mack daddy's about to get real indy
Check it out, nigga, pump up the Vega
Put your hand on a trigger, buck buck 'til you give a
Hot one, he caught one straight to the dome
It's the Mister Bigga, the Figga that's poppin' the shit on the microphone
End of the rhyme, so it's back to the grind
Stayin' strapped with a 9, nigga, 'cause it's about that time

[Chorus]
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9
Stuck to me grind, it's about that time
Me coming again, me coming again because me strapped with me 9

[Outro]
Nuff respect to the man called JT the Bigga Figga, bwoy
'Cause it's about that time
