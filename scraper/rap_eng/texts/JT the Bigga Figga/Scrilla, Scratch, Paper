[Intro: JT the Bigga Figga]
Hahahaha, yeah, mayne, haha
Back up in this muthafucka
You got your boy JT the Bigga Figga, mayne
Just chillin' with my folks 11/5 and Cougnut up in the studio
Premier productions puttin' it down from a G's persepective
And I got my boy TC in the muthafuckin' house
You got your boy JT, mayne, we layin' it down
That Frisco shit, check it out

[Verse 1: Maine-O]
Who you pullin' your weapon to? Nigga, who you think you steppin' to?
I'm packing two Glocks, and if I see your weapon, fool, I'm letting loose
You're trying to take away my Peruvian
Well, click-clack, put in a casket is what you'll be instead be doin'
That suicidal G shit, and I know I won't rest
'Cause all I know is pimpin' them hoes to make cash and blast, nigga
That, lotta money and drugs, keep Vega's and bust
And I ain't got love for you bitches, I just got love, uh

[Verse 2: Hennesy]
I'm sick of niggas smiling in my face but don't like me
Jealous of my fame and my game but won't fight me
Telling all my hoes that they think a nigga's shiesty
Because I'm clocking dough and peeling hoes and laying pipe
See, I throw from the shoulders 'cause I'm a soldier from the Bay
And if you wanna play then make way for the AK
Nigga, say, what you want but you can't stop it
I'm laying you on your stomach with the gat then rip them pockets

[Chorus]
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Tryna get my paper but they just don't know, playa
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Checking my grip, I'm getting my mail
I'm thinking about my clientele
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Going out to my Frisco homies, yeah
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Tryna get my paper but they just don't know

[Verse 3: Cougnut]
I pack a Glock in case I gotta pop a shiesty muthafucka
Tryna set up shop on my fuckin' dark block
200 block dog mackin', millimeter packin', head crackin'
Young BG's down for the scrilla jackin'
Get your Glocks ready 'cause I'm 'bout to throw a fit
And pistol whip all you bustas with that hoe ass shit
You talk good ones, muthafuckas, but you're scared to stop
You set up shop, nigga, I'ma play connect the dot

[Verse 4: Taydatay]
Jump into the bucket, hopped to the fuckin' scene
Slangin' the A-1 yola candy on them corners, making that green
Having that cream, nigga
What you gon' do if I be on your block?
Bustin' at you niggas set trippin' and shit
Better duck before I bust you out
Better watch your back, better watch your step, better watch your muthafuckin' shit
Before I creep and leave you niggas wet, dead as fuck
And I be mobbin' to the death
To you bitches, Taydatay; to you niggas, Taydatay

[Chorus]
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Tryna get my paper but they just don't know, playa
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Checking my grip, I'm getting my mail
I'm thinking about my clientele
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Going out to my Frisco homies, yeah
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Tryna get my paper but they just don't know

[Verse 5: JT the Bigga Figga]
Coming to get that green, the nigga that stack that paper
Take that, making my money bundles
'Cause niggas be coming with dope and they running to Jake
So then it rumbles
Remember the game, the 50 and swang
Come in the game, you cooking your thang
You're bringing the pain, I'm making it swing
Stacking my chips, scooping the grits daily
These niggas be in my face but I be knowing these niggas hate me
Acquired a grip, I'm checking my mail, I'm thinking about my clientele
I'm moving my game to multiple stacks and flipping the tracks, I'm making it swell
Can't you tell, these players be balling by the Bay
They getting their paper, so what in the fuck you got to say?
I wanted to be, a hustler that delivered the flavor
You place your orders and come to the borders, dope is on the table
Now I'm able, to give up the game and make it kosher
While niggas is posted and lifted off Canadian doja
Keeping it real wherever I'ma have to make the
Fool ass nigga, scrilla, scratch, paper

[Chorus]
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Tryna get my paper but they just don't know, playa
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Checking my grip, I'm getting my mail
I'm thinking about my clientele
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Going out to my Frisco homies, yeah
Scrilla, scratch, paper
Scrilla, scratch, paper

[Outro: JT the Bigga Figga]
