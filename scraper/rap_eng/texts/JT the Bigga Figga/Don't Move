Yea, yea, yea, yea
It's yo folks Mac Mall ???
Always keep my shit mayne. Ya know?!

Where it's at nigga?


Verse 1 *(Mac Mall)*

I'm a cut throat nigga
I told her, gone off that Nitro
Go mani on yo block makin ??? sleep wit the lights on
Mr. Vicious down to do wrong
Wit a pack of savage niggas that'll come an get ya outta ya jones
Damn them squares ain't safe
Got him for the briefcase
A big face
And I was bare faced
I know ya hate the taste of my name in yo mouth
You know what I'm bout
Quick to test yo d-boy clout an leave ya laid out
Busta I never liked ya keep a thousand yards stiff
When I'm mashin by, ya pussy posse ain't gon' appear
Like if I hopped out, told ya to run yo shit playa
We both know that the moss will leave yo ass dead
I run the hood like a jungle
King of the beast
Head hunters after me, I make 'em all bleed
Fuck the rollas man, they betta not run up on my plot
Cuz I won't dump until I drop my semi on cops
Blowin my top
Lettin loose like a nut
Should all the stoppers bag me up that's how ya bring the funk
So when ya see me comin, folks ya betta watch ya shit
I start to mobbin in this BITCH! MUTHA FUCKA!


Chorus *(Mac Mall)*

You know I want it nigga
I know you got it nigga
When you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga
You know I want it nigga
I know you  got it nigga
When you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga
Don't flinch
Don't Move
Don't break
My bottle will make ya body shake sucka
Don't flinch
Don't Move
Don't break
Or today is gon' be your last day
(Wha?)
(Wha?)
(Wha?)

Verse 2 *(JT Tha Bigga Figga)*

As I rumble through the clothes in yo dresser
Hopin I catch ya
Wit a bundle of bread cut him up an get him for his vest
An his pistol
An his sacks
Stuff my pockets
Out the back
An I'm off to the track
4-5 an a vest an I'm all in black
An i got me a gat
Cuz you know an I know that war field
That broke niggas provoke niggas
An dumb niggas gon' go there
But oh well
It's all official, comin to get ya
Niggas wit dope sells
An if you wonder we gon' split ya
Niggas wit mo mail
This Cali livin' ain't no jokin
Paper chasin on my hustle to the day I go broke
Satisfied wit my riches
Never that I keep it goin wit my
Cut him all in the back of a bucket we blowin
Test the nuts of these ridas
Man it's on, on sight
Got my pistol in my pocket an I'm ready to strike
We foldin 'em up like blankets
Tuck 'em away like Ben Franklin's
On a day-to-day basis, different places an leave 'em stankin
Don't Move nigga


Chorus  *(JT Tha Bigga Figga)* 2x

You know I want it nigga
I know you got it nigga
When you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga
You know I want it nigga
I know you  got it nigga
When you see me pull out my heat, juss come up out it nigga
Don't flinch
Don't Move
Don't break
My bottle will make ya body shake sucka
Don't flinch
Don't Move
Don't break
Or today is gon' be your last day
