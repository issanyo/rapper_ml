[Verse 1]
How far would you take it? How far would you go?
How far would it be before you let them playas know
Do or die, you reply, think before you speak
‘Cause the wrong attitude’ll get you laid out in the street
I’m not flexin’, no need for your Smith and Wesson
Good conversation for the station for the times that you’ll be facin’
So put yourself in place before I have to lace your boots
Or my homie Rack Skerz will have to pull ya by your roots
So think twice and be nice and that’s the way it goes and
Get yourself prepared for the storm before it rolls in
And everything’ll be alright
So put your mack hand down until it’s time to strike
I put it down

[Chorus]
Playa, put your mack hand down
If you represent your town, mayne, then you gotta put it down
Playa, put your mack hand down
And stay away from perpetrators and them busta browns

[Verse 2]
I turned my back, this is their one chance for hope
They used the red beam to burn away the rope
Yell “GLP” and everybody heard this
1995, all them playa haters nervous
Someone tried to bite—who could be this trife?
Knowing goddamn well I’m in the lab every night
But uh, I don’t be trippin’ ‘cause I know they try to ruin
Because they see me doin’ the game that they pursuin’
If they break, they broke, but don’t choke off the simple fact
Game is thick up in the Moe, that’s why we hit the ‘gnac
Dedicated to this game I spit
But I, meditated and I came with hits
So I, snatch my props and then I can’t say please
Give me the microphone and let me stack my G’s
Moved on up to bigger thangs, and then I bring the pain
I let the mobile ring, so let the 50 swing
In the cuts of the Motown
Where the hustlers and players like to throw down
In the middle of the night ‘cause we game tight
For the 1995, mayne, it’s time to strike
I put it down

[Chorus]
Playa, put your mack hand down
If you represent your town, mayne, then you gotta put it down
Playa, put your mack hand down
And stay away from perpetrators and them busta browns
I put it down
Playa, put your mack hand down
If you represent your town, mayne, then you gotta put it down
Playa, put your mack hand down
And stay away from perpetrators and them busta browns

[Outro: Pom Pom]
Put your mack hand down…put your mack hand down
Put your mack hand down, yeah, yeah yeah yeah…
Ooh ooh, I…I’m gonna put my mack hand down
Put my mack hand down, gon’ put mack hand down
Put my mack hand, mack hand, mack hand down, yeah
I…I…I…I…
