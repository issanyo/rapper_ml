[Verse 1: JT the Bigga Figga]
Peep game from the mack on track with these
Got the tapes and the wax, checking stacks with ease
‘Cause it’s the Bigga, the Figga, the ones who came to see ya
A funky type of style of rappin’ ‘cause we flowin’ like a river
Never ever ever have you seen a player like me
Poppin’ so swell, I got the clientele
So what’s up, what’s up? Can I pass to my brother?
Don’t get mad because we bounce like rubber
Now I told ya, we wasn’t gon’ stop ‘til we major
Hooked up flights with Skynet pagers
From coast to coast, we won’t brag or boast
We’ll take a toast, to the boys that flow, you know
Me and D-Moe, two playas from the Get Low
Straight up outta Frisco, so now you suckas kniz-know
Feel the flow, feel the flow, I know you know we good to go
We mackin’ ‘em and stackin’ ‘em, and afterward, we crackin’ ‘em
We packin’ ‘em up, we wrappin’ ‘em up, we shippin’ ‘em off to Boston
They try to play some players so you know it’s gonna cost ‘em
It ain’t no thang to make it swang and make the beat saucy
Write the raps, lay the tracks, then you know it’s bossy
Peep game

[Verse 2: D-Moe]
Just P-double E-P some G-A-M-E
From D-dash-M-O-E, the Y-O-U-N-G
S-T-izA, ‘cause in 9-trizzay
I gotta get paid and can’t fade minimum wage
‘Cause I be comin’ saucy like spaghetti, tryna get my fetti
Do you feel me? ‘Cause I felt me
Now tell me do I need to be bad like hangin’
On the turf moving work, smoking dank? Nope
I’m posted in the studio like daily
Keepin’ funky verses but the radio won’t play me
They say we always cuss every time I start to bust
And plus at a concert, my homies from the hood kick dust
But a must is a must, so we must get our currency
Tapes and concerts, posters and CD’s
So take a piece of game from a brother that’s a gamer
Put me in your clip, and cock me in your chamber
‘Cause we be shootin’ lyrics like a 4-5
And we be poppin’ game like a Tec-9
So respect mine and the rest of GLP
And one love to my folks and for Jt
Peep game

[Verse 3: JT the Bigga Figga + D-Moe]
It’s like a gangbang thang, mayne, the way the beat just gon’ swang
But only gang that we bang is checkin’ mail for our game
My homie O-Z-D-to the R-to the E, upcoming rapper from the SFC
Brought it to my attention I need to mention some of my generosity
Addicted by them rappers, them none act street jackers
Put out our own tapes and turf out here to be nothin’ but packers
So that’s what me and D-Moe do, so do the dope to take advantage of the rap game
Poppin’ so swell, being in the game in ‘85 and ain’t nothin’ changed
Living the game, so insane, tryna maintain my currency
Does work off in the dirt, steady tryna murder me
The Y-the B-the G is coming sicker than a flu
On some liquor when his finger’s on the trigger
Peep game
