[Intro]
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Hahaha, '95 baby, it's going down
Tell 'em, baby

[Verse 1: Seff tha Gaffla]
Tell me how does it feel to get played by a hoe?
Nigga, I wouldn't know, my destination's Fillmore
Feel me though
Pimpin' hoes on the daily is my hustle
Trying to survive so I strive using muscle
The step where I'm from, if you don't pimp, you don't eat
From the valley to the Flavo-C up to pastry
Page me when you need a pimp to talk to
Fillmore's the turf where the proper hoes walk through
Independent player with the major conversation
Had two roads to go, pimp or die of starvation
I chose to pimp, couldn't see myself singing the blues
Keep a bitch broke, I flow and buy your hoe tennis shoes
So she can run around the block with the stack
Definition of a Fillmore nigga, pimpin' is a mack
Stay on track, get all the fetti that you can get
Seff tha Gaffla comin' through in the '90 drop 'Vette

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Can't be idiotic off the chronic
The last time that they heard some of these cats, man, they plotted
But they cannot stop it, my forward progress is constant
Nonsense in Fillmoe, '95, us niggas do not value our lives and
Strive to survive is like each in a piece, we can't come together with the peace
Each and everyone got a gun so you know they release
Watch the increase in homicides, a gang of my homies locked
Behind the walls beating on their balls, looking up at the sky
Wondering when that you're down again, loungin' friends
But they do not know niggas starving, we ain't having ends
Death walking around with his mug on under a hood
Up to no good, nigga, you should
Hold on, since my opinion sending me nothing
Let me save my breath, your kind ain't got too much time left, gangsta

[Verse 3: D-Moe]
Body cold, ice froze, so captivated
To the devil or the Most High, a young life is compensated
I made it 20 years, seen many friends get bucked down
And fears that I'd be trucked down is why D-Moe don't fuck around
I'm like a bloodhound and I smell the funk
Of a dozen dirty dogs with the scent of a skunk
Hella drunk off that Grand Ma', dozing off that doja
I quickly reminisce about my dawg, Young Ova
I got my motto peeling caps, fuck busting raps
Killing the cats that pulled their straps and laid him on his back
But I'm on track, intact with these ghetto games
Don't go against the grain, my main thang's to make a change
Inside my brain, shit is blurry
I'm fighting my anger with a fury, I seen 'em blasted and buried
Now I'm worried about my own life, 'cause it's a fact
All the dirt that I've done since age 1 is coming back
Watch your back as I attack with the Mac-1-0
It's D-dash-Moe from 924, blazing blunts by the 'Sco

[Verse 4: Blue Chip]
I'm feeling happy but I'm hurting, pulling down a curtain
Damn, another player took up off the earth
Who did it? Where they from? What, another homie?
Man, back in the days, it was real but now love nowadays is so phony
Can't be forsaken, so many family's hearts steady breaking
We need to have a 'stop the violence' presentation
And have thousands of participants and teach
Education to our slowly dying young that's strong generation
I know I'm hurting my mother but it's the poor and the rich
And I'll be damned if I get the short end of the stick
Yes, I stack the dollar, but beg for a dollar, fuck that
I stack a major fuckin' grip and still charge a punk bitch in this game
Focus on the dopest
Shit that you heard, the skids nigga wrote this, bitch
Don't deceive, I have greed, just perceive
Living lavish, smoking the indo, we the players stacking major cabbage
Your life or his life, no matter what side
The nigga with the gun or the brother who died
So I pick and choose, nigga, you lose, you know the rules, stay real
Or be an overnight gangsta off the booth

[Verse 5: JT the Bigga Figga]
What goes on when I finish spitting game?
Shit gives us problems like seeds in the rain
More power to you, motivated by your pay
Stayed away from double agents but you still caught a case
Young homies on the block with their dome straight hittin'
This is going out to the homies up in Quentin
Folsom, Suzy, the players in the 'Ville
The homies in the county but you got to keep it real, feel
Me when I be buckin' through the town
I represent the Low so they represent the crown
Frown on your face when the bass hit your speakers
We all is the victims and the Feds is the creepers
Crept up in your house, if you're dirty then it's over
58 G's and four pounds of doja
Hit your other spot, found the scale and the chop
Same homies that you kick it with the one's that got you popped
Or you're striking in your bucket but you know you're looking shifty
Holding the cutty with the clip that hold 50
The way the homies teach 'em, man, we never knew you had a crew
Sharp and in your bucket freeloading up the avenue
Revenues turning, Vogues on the street burning
Face the facts, their stacks were milly macks
Or tracks they try to chill, then they try to kill
Cut a nigga throat and then they act real ill
Get the bill from the coroner, so I'm warning ya
From the FilthyMoe town in the state of California
Take my place as the rightful owner
Fuckin' with my folks, mayne, you's a goner
Moving on the double causing trouble
Take it from the Figga, mayne, you know it's time to bubble
Above and beyond for the game that it shows
The Get Low Playaz straight down doors, ya froze

[Outro: JT the Bigga Figga]
Haha, that's how we do it, mayne
We come tight from The GLP, baby boy
Right out the Fillmoe town, you know what I'm sayin'
