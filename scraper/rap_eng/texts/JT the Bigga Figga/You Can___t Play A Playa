[Intro dialogue]

[Verse 1]
You can't play a playa, back so I could check my pimpin'
About you good for nothin' niggas and you no good ass women
Tell my so-called homeboys, the ones that's salty
They got no game, mayne, because they faulty
Now I'm slippin', slidin', walking around my hood glidin'
Off them dank pills my boys hooked up, ridin'
High-sidin', pushin' to one of the beats that my boy made
Stumpin' and jumpin' and bumpin' them rhymes 'cause shit's played
Now I'm rolling down the strip
With the chronic that keep candy paint on hit
Taxin' and waxin', maxin' on the scene
Them little hoochies from the hood tryna get me for my green
No way, Jose, you hoes get no play
You're dealing with the Bigga, the Figga, the niggeta from the Bay
And you're talking about the mack from the Moetown
You're lowdown, slow down, 'cause I could make the whole ground
Shake and bake and take two to the chin
Laid that ass out, we coming again, me coming again
So um, back the fuck up before I say'a
Mister Mayor, huh, you can't play a playa

[Verse 2]
Playing on the scene every day of the week
Mister J to the T from the Get Low P
Got my microphone clutched in my right hand
I'm the man with the plan to make you say, "goddamn"
Moving through the crowd, stepping on your toes
Throwing chin blows 'cause the Bigga boy knows, huh
'Cause I'm hyper, riper than an apple
Bust a cap and laugh, hoe, shake and leave you baffled
Tic, tac, knick, knack
Grab your gat, black, too late, you got jacked
'Cause this is going out to the players
Not the player haters but the players
The boys that peep game, the ones that stack mail
The ones that come from the shoulders and straight swell
Not the ones that come from the trigger
Try to act like a giant 'cause he think he bigger
Just an overnight gangsta tryna earn stripes
'Bout to get wrapped up by the spray of the TEC-9
Niggas ain't playing in the '93
Even young OG's with automatic heat
That's why I mind my own and stay bolo
Playa hatin' niggas need to be rolled on
And then I stack and mack and get fat
The track is on hit 'cause you know I'm back
To test the best and rip shop
Puttin' in much work without even using a Glock
Because I'm shakin' 'em, breakin' 'em, movin' 'em, makin' 'em, takin' 'em, breakin' 'em down
Make that shit pound with this underground sound
So kick on back before I say'a
Mister Mayor, huh, you can't play a playa

[Interlude]
Mayne, guess what, mayne
What's up?
Man, I had that nigga JT bitch last night, mayne
Nigga, I'm serious, mayne
Nigga, how you had that hoe?
Man, I had that bitch at the telly giving nookie ass, mayne
That's real, mayne

[Verse 3]
Peep game, bro, you could have that hoe
She been jockin' a young player since '84
And about them hoes, mayne, they ain't no good
They'll try to play a player if they think they could
But they can't play me, so they must play you
I've been peeping the game, it ain't no thang
Driving them punk ass hoes insane
When it comes to the mackin', 'cause mackin' is actin'
Especially when your bitch stackin'
So the next time you're trippin' off your hoe, let that hoe go
'Cause when you let that hoe go, one gon' come, fa sho
Again, you could kick back and pull up a chair
And peep game from the muthafuckin' playa, bitch
