[Intro: D-Moe]
Back in the muthafuckin' house for the 9-trizzay
My boy JT the Bigga Figga, young playa from the Bizzay
Flippin' the script and snatchin' grip
Throwing way too many shots at to you mark ass niggas domes
Know what I'm sayin', y'all can't fuck with the Get Low P, mayne

[Verse: JT the Bigga Figga]
You comin' to get, you checkin' my style
I'm flippin' it well on top of the pile
I'm breakin' it down to put on accounts
So jump in your bucket and swing it around
Remember the plan, I gave you a gram, so siggidy-scram this party
Figgedy-flip the triggidy-track, I'm making it phat by trickin' my stack
You're breakin' your back, you're breakin' your bone
You pick on the suckers who ready to roll
Y'all humblin', bumblin', fumblin', talking about the suckers who mumblin'
Bubblin', doublin' up my miggidy-mail while making it swell
For shiggidy-show and tiznell for doing the shit wiznell
Making my own, making it dome, making the shit to shake your home
You rattle and thump and jiggidy-jump, I ain't no punk busta
Cream of the crop, crop of the creep
Running the ones who ready to sleep
Making the beat complete, so saucy that they turning their cheek
Deliver the blow, I'm lettin' 'em know
This is the way I fliggedy-flow
I'm from the town, I'm breaking it down legitimate, get rid of it
You shoulda hit the button, I'm cuttin', they bluffin'
Shake up the cake, make it and bake, 36 O's of
36 soldiers on the strip smoking doja
I told ya, I rolled ya, now I gotta throw ya
And if I hold ya, who gon' hold me?
How you gon' stop a G with a whole ki?

[Outro: D-Moe & JT the Bigga Figga]
Now that's what the fuck I'm talking about
Niggas can't fade the Get Low flow 'cause we coming way doper than yayo
Mail stack so capital but don't get dramatical
The bullets go automatical
So if it's static, go, roll up the window and light the indio
And oh, I'm D-Moe, and that's my folks, the Bigga Figga
And we gon' hit the way way for 9-trey-trey
And get low and to throw your back door in 9-4, you knid-know, hoe?
Yeah, we know what time it is, boy
They can't fuck with the flavor
Break it on down
So, Bigga Figga, you making beats and shit like this now, huh?
Yeah, you know I'm making that shit
Oh, they can't fuck with me on no beats
Young nigga poppin' that shit and laying them tracks, you know what I'm saying
At the house at that, ha
Yeah, the Get Low P coming way too tight for 9-trey, 9-4, and 9-5
Just a little something to ride to
Yeah, check it out
