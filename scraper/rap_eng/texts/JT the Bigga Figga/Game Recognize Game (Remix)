Got me so confused

[Scratched Chorus 2x]
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
In the Bay mayne, in, in the Bay mayne

[Verse 1: JT the Bigga Figga]
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
The Biggity-mack to stiggity-stack on them triz-acks
Coming to kick them fiz-acts for you players
About to lace your game tight so pull up your chairs (huh)
And don't trip off them wanna-bes, you wanna see
Cause I'm-a have it going on like the fifteenth
First of the month, strapped with your blunt
For your paper, docked in the spot so you can take a-
-nother dose of major, all players in the game
It's a '94 thang ain't a damn thing changed
And on them beats mayne, you best to get with me
A mack like myself gots to keep my game crispy
Tight, tighter than the tightest
Laying them tracks down cause you know I've got the finest
Skills in producin' cause I can get loose-in'
And when it comes to mackin', you know that I be stackin', so

[Refrain: Scratched Chorus and JT the Bigga Figga]
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
And you know it don't stop
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
In the Bay mayne, in, in the Bay mayne
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
We bout to take it to the top
Game recognize game in the Bay mayne
Game, in the Bay mayne, in, in the Bay mayne

[Verse 2: JT the Bigga Figga]
Astronomical, let's play some dominoes
He owe me money but I know you got drama, though
Gift of the gab for the tag that I'm takin'
Coming up in this market and you know we 'bouts to make a
Cause when you asleep, I got to get the beat
Number one macker not a cracker for the century
Cause I been doing this for way too long
I goes on and on to the break of dawn
I gots to get my props and chop all the tops
And make sure it rocks and check all my wops
Independently, is a friend to me
Gimme all my money cause I ain't got time for splitting it, G
Mackadocious, cause I gets ferocious
The number one player is the one who gets the closest
How many tracks would it take for me?
To open up the door for the GLP?
Rack Skerz, D-Moe and them verbs
The young baby boy San Quinn coming in perved
And the rest of the Get Low P
Coming in dope with that player JT cause, um

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: JT the Bigga Figga]
Why must I dust off these hits?
Come with these grips so let me check all these grits
Thick in rotation, I got to get my mail on
Coming around the corner doing 100 about to swell on
Submission to the one and only most high, never to try to scheme
You gets trapped with the triple beam
So what's the difference in your distribution?
Cause I can take you to another level and find the solution
Popping like a player, won't pay them cause you're popping
Got the underminded macking on your mind, you're chopping
Up, the data, because I got fatta
Step in my way hear these lyrics rat-a-tat-a
And now I'm posted in my studio
I was thinking about the time when I want to shoot this video
I was punked, thought I wasn't?
Got rushed by my cousin with a bigger budget
So now we on the way-way, headed for this payday
Maxin' (Lights, camera, action)
And you know we gonna wreck it
So peep game from a player, and chiggy-chiggy-check it cause, um

[Scratched Chorus 2x]
