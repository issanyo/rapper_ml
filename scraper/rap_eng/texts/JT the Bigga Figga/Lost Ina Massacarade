[Intro]
Here, here, here we go again y’all
Give it up and then we then we go again y’all
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You see it’s nothing like the drama but it just don’t stop
Anticipating, marinating, now you’re ready to pop
You’re ready to break a thang, and bake up a cake, and make up O-Z’s
You steadily getting your paper on the block, stacking your G’s
You’s a rapper but you’re trying to get your money too
Splitting up your time between your hustle and your baby boo
Niggas plottin’, ain’t no time for hurtin’
Standing up on your toes and rolling your Vogues, so now you’re perpin’
Playas giving up dap, teeth with the gold caps
Feds got your phone tapped, now you’re tryna stay strapped
You shoulda listened to that young San Quinn
And traded your rocks and your gat for that pad and pen
Them niggas done snitched, now you’re through—what are you gonna do?
Rotting up in the county or you’re copping to a lesser, fool
Retaliation but you might get sprayed
One more player in the game lost in that masquerade
And that’s real

[Chorus]
Straight ballin’, lost in a masquerade
You slipped in quick and tried to get paid
You tryna get your paper but your paper don’t make me
I set up the deals, you put up the skills, I bet’cha you’re fake, see
Straight ballin’, lost in a masquerade
You slipped in quick and tried to get paid
You tryna get your paper but your paper don’t make me
I set up the deals, you put up the skills, I bet’cha you’re fake, see

[Verse 2]
Commissary for the moment but it ain’t no joke
A hundred and twenty dollars on your books, you’re ready to smoke
Hooked up with the kitchen crew, drinking up the Pruno
Court in the morning, 5:20 up in Bruno
You shoulda broke ‘em down and played the role of a smoker
Coulda gave ‘em three for 50 then you wouldn’t have had to choke ‘em
Made my way to the office, stayed away from double crosses
Player haters in your camp trying to set you up for losses
Now you weigh the situation but the game was overlooking
Contemplated too long, now your power’s overtooken
Tryna be the major baller in the town, that is your purpose
Got the bread that you made but you didn’t scratch the surface
Million-dollar contract slipping through the border cracks
Setting up the artifacts, kicking out the quarter stacks
Kinda healthy with a spot in the shade
‘Cause I’m down with Allah and not that masquerade
And that’s real

[Chorus]
Straight ballin’, lost in a masquerade
You slipped in quick and tried to get paid
You tryna get your paper but your paper don’t make me
I set up the deals, you put up the skills, I bet’cha you’re fake, see
Straight ballin’, lost in a masquerade
You slipped in quick and tried to get paid
You tryna get your paper but your paper don’t make me
I set up the deals, you put up the skills, I bet’cha you’re fake, see
