I told you once I told you twice
The Bigga Figga nigga ain't nothin' nice
So get your game for the day man I would advise ya
It ain't the meal it's just the meal it's just an appetizer

Start the flow show playas gotta get low
Poppin' at the ho hoes in the front row, row
Don't mack on a bitch for the hell of it
Because it's not irrelevant
But still she gotta do it
I do what I want to do the boys in the blue
Wanna fuck with the niggas in my crew
Knowin' it's the top notch there with the functions
Better known as the Get Low Productions
Passin' them licks going nationwide
Shit was thick when I was taking that ride
Tryin' to get a show here trying to get a show there
Mothafuckas trippin' but a nigga didn't care
Bumpin' my shit everywhere I went
Gettin' my money in dollars and cents
Jiggin' my tapes on Mac Daddy boulevard
Didn't give a fuck if you had a hot credit card
Playin' my demo rollin' in a limo
Me and young Herm SB with the indo
Two mack daddies dog and a caddy
Pitbull drop gold Z's and a candy
D-Moe the Youngsta, Seff the Gaffla
JT The Bigga what more could you ask for?
Maybe you could ask for Steve or Gigolo
If I didn't tell you then they will let you know
Peepin' out game so you better try to wise up
It ain't the meal it's just the appetizer

Yeah that's my boy JT off up in this mothafuckin' record for
You just a little appetizer, but now we got the full
Force meal cause you know the deal ya know

At the party at the Hyatt hotel
You ain't got a room too bad oh well
You can be a baller with a fat stack
But forger the ass if you ain't no rapper
Poppin' at a bitch but that ain't shit
The nigga that qualified got a platinum hit
That's right groupies playing like Snoopy
All I want is the oochie coochie
Tryin' to get them before they get me
Plottin' on the one with all the money
A Honda Accord and a gang of ass
On my tip for a backstage pass
Tellin' me to come whenever I'm ready
Asking more questions than Fab Five Freddy
End of the summer and shit kinda cool
Wanna give up the ass before they go back to school
Notice at a party bitches be in fresh clothes
I see right through them they ain't nothin' but turf hoes
Straight pony tails and clothes that they borrowed
They look good now they won't look good tomorrow
Niggas goin out for punk ass bitches
Keepin' 'em fresh and a pocket full or riches
Get some game is what you better do
Find a trick and sell her a dream or two
That's how it's done in the city of Frisco
Niggas be mackin', niggas be gettin' low
Not going low on them hoes like them others
Being myself I can't be like them brothers
You better get some game and you better try to wise up
But if you eat the ass then that's your appetizer

Yeah what's up my nigga you done that shit what's up
My nigga JT's in the mothafuckin' house kick some more
Of that shit for your boy

Startin' my last verse straight outta Frisco
Comin' from the shoulders don't need no pistol
Niggas always talkin' about how they gangstas
Pop a nigga quick but I'd rather bank ya
And wake you up and bank your ass again
And go to the store for some juice and gin
And walk to the house and make me another hit
SP-12 coming out with some funky shit
Like this song here called Appetizer
Just to let you know and just to remind ya
Poppin' much flavor is it spicy enough?
Or is it too tender, or is it too tough?
I think I put it together just fine
Ya hear me once and ya wanna rewind
So that's just lettin' me know that it's on hit
You hear my style and niggas can't fuck with it
Try to play deep and they put on a show
Goin' toe to toe they can't fuck with my flow
'Cause you know my style too sick
Like the crazy mothafucka named Gin, the pit
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up shake 'em
Drag him in a cut cause now it's time to break him
Tear it off nigga what you got
Tip toe tip, toe to the mothafuckin spot
