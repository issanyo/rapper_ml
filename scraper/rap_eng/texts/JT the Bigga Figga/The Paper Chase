[Intro]
Yeah, man, I hope niggas get this chase on, mayne
Hope you got your running shoes, boy
Huh, that's real

[Verse 1]
On a paper chase, chasing papers, pulling capers
Flipping a dope ass ride when it's time to glide
Shit's so thick it ain't funny
Especially when you're flipping a car off another nigga money
And niggas so dirty, they roll around with ya
Squattin' all over the fuckin' town with ya
Knowing they done got this nigga for about 10 G's
Went and got at the next nigga and bought hella O-Z's
Quick to flip, hit the strip, pop the clip
Strapped at all times so the sucker won't trip
Down and dirty on the block about them snaps
Niggas up in your mix so it's time to bust a few caps
Talking about, "How you come up so quick and where the fuck you get that mail from?"
Stay out my shit like this, punk bitch, you better run
Sideways on a mission to the Moe, gotta lay low for the time being
Coming so ridic', come inside, they even worth seeing
Made a big mistake, bought a cake from a F-E-D
With the profits from the O-Z
Knotted, better hide it, 'cause if you won't, trot it
Or when you ride it, 'cause if you don't, fuck
You'd be stuck like Chuck for the century
In the penitentiary calling shots like an OG
All because of the paper you was chasing
And all because of the goddamn lives you was taking
So vicious when it comes to the stack game
Get your money all the time rolling in a chrome 9
And that's how it be in the '93
Fuck a Glock 17, bought a Glock 23
So peep game and pump up your bass
And check what I'm talking 'bout on the paper chase

The paper chase, nigga, the paper chase
The paper chase, nigga, the paper chase
Paper chase

Pass me my Zapco, mayne, pump that shit up

[Verse 2]
Street life on the Westside of Frisco
Critical, but it's time for a jack, hoe
Robbery, a 211 in progress
Strong Black male but you know you can't fade this
To watch my back, I got a 9
To make sure everything go fine, hmm
They act like it's Black Season
But I'ma give their punk ass 17 reasons
Not to fuck with a G
'Cause yes, I'm an OG straight from the cold streets
California lifestyle from all the players
Hoods and convicts, gangs with strong rep
Brothers doing dirt on a daily basis
Always on the run 'cause they tryna take this
Game from the ganker, money from the banker
Even tried to get my homie D-Moe for the dank'a
But check it out, nigga, that ain't shit
Niggas on the street tryna check a grip
I mean, getting it on, I mean, taking your chrome
Cutting off gauge barrels, putting 'em to your dome
I mean, running in your home, mayne, fully loaded
Jumping in your shit 'cause it's time to roll it
Squattin', plottin' on the next nigga, creepin' through the cuts
Yeah, they know what's up 'cause they don't give a fuck
Two to the face, but don't catch a case
That's how it is, mayne, on the paper chase

The paper chase, the paper chase, nigga
The paper chase, on a muthafuckin' paper chase
