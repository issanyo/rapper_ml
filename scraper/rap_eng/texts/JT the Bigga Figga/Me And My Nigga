[Intro]
There this fool go right there
C'mon my nigga, we got some business to handle
It's your mothafuckin' time

[Verse 1]
Me and my nigga, rollin' through the streets of Frisco
Strapped in a bucket, puffin' the indo
Waitin' on a call from a nigga named Woop
'Cause he want a quarter pound of the sticky green chew
Now I never leave my house without my nigga
I got the hand, and he got the trigga
A perfect combination like Daytons and Vogues
A proper show stopper that'll feed you with hoes
Now I'm on my way to my destination
Stopped at a light, with a confrontation
By marks on the side a me, tryin' to trip
So I grabbed my nigga, popped in the clip
Now if I set trip, they'll try to waste me
And if I mash, they'll try to chase me
So the best thing to do is hold my composure
Niggas start blastin', damn, I told ya
I gotta peep game and I gotta be cool
'Cause I feel kinda safe in the four forty-two
But the niggas straight popped, but a nigga popped back
JT not the one sittin' there gettin' jacked
Now I'm rollin', on my way back to Fillmoe
Niggas on my shit in a five point oh
I don't know why, I don't have a clue
But handle my business is the only thing to do
'Cause a lotta young niggas go through this
But a nigga like me'll just do this
'Cause you know I'm not down with killin' off the black man
But at this time, that's my only plan
I'm in trouble, as you can see
So I gotta get them, before they get me
I liked the way, that things was goin' down
Now these fools was in my part of town
Niggas didn't know about the YBG
So I led them fools to a dead-end street
Then I jumped out my shit and my finger was itchin'
'Cause the punks musta been outta ammunition
Ran up to the car straight blastin' ass
Then I hopped in my shit and mashed on the gas
They didn't know why and they could not figure
Didn't need no help, just me and my nigga

[Chorus]
Me and my nigga, me and my nigga
We got to get paid
Me and my nigga, me and my nigga
We gotta get, where's my nigga?

[Verse 2]
Damn, why would you ask this?
He's kind of small and he's made out of plastic
You can't see him, so don't even trip
Only one in the clip, with the hallow-point tip
So back up and get it together
Father named MAC, mother named Beretta
Had a big brother and his name was TEC-9
He did the crime, now he gotta do time
JT's in the house, the one on the mic
Yeah that's me, yeah that's right
The one that can flow, the one that can pop it
Play a funky beat and you know I'ma drop it
Let me tell ya little story about a long time ago
When we did a little show, but a nigga didn't know
When it's time for funk, suckas go to the trunk
But all that is, is a high powered punk
In the midst of the crowd, with the young and the old'n
Didn't need no gap, 'cause I could come from the shoulders
Security with my nigga on stage
'Cause in the back, we had the TEC and the twelve guage
Niggas gettin' tipsy, drinkin' Grand Marny
Smokin' dank, freakin' hoes in the party
Brothas in a rush, gold rings and such
From the slightest touch, there's gonna be a bum rush
'Cause you no they don't understand grattitude
'Cause every fuckin' nigga in the party got an attitude
Bitches on jock
Tryna get with a nigga who's poppin' so they can get a cock
Shit was kinda proper
Walked through the crowd so I could look at the roster
Check it out, see what it say
First Huey MC, then us then 4-Tay
What a way to go about
But before we could shock it, young punks tried to turn it out
'Cause you know we like to rap a lot
But everybody's takin' the fuckin' drama to the parking lot
Shit's so thick, I feel static
Niggas ain't playin', huh, niggas got automatics
Against all odds, we had a pump and a TEC
But a player like me, demands my respect
And you're talkin' 'bout peace?
Brothers start lettin' rounds off in the street
Tryin' to play Rambo
Rat-tat-tat-tat, now my man dead bro
It was so much confusion
I was hopin' that it didn't have to come to this conclusion
Damn, a nigga can't even chill
'Cause tonight, it was kill or be killed
They didn't know why and they could not figure
Didn't need no help, just me and my nigga

[Chorus]
Me and my nigga, me and my nigga
The nine millimeter, and the Bigga Figga
Me and my nigga, me and my nigga
The nine millimeter, and the Bigga Figga, fool
