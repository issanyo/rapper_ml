Welcome
Let the games begin, and we’re uninvited
This yo’ bread bakin’, Fed shakin’ Frisco city counterpart
JT Tha Bigga Figga, Game Recognize Game in the Bay, mayne
On this intro for the young Mac Dreezy
Man, I remember when we first hooked up on a humbug
In the Big Oaktown, Jack London Square
Diamond shoppin’ and collar poppin’
Never to know we the top of the Rompin’ Nation
Paper chasin’ and Chevy racin’
That’s our occupation
But he fresh up out the feds though
With his new album Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
Guaranteed to have every ghetto nigga sprung
So peep this here game, mayne

I was sixteen-years-old, fresh up off the ranch
Got an extra 45 days, got caught with a half a tamp
Too Hard for the Radio poundin’ in Chevy Novas
Young soldiers off killa doja, blaze the roper, I told ya
What’s Really Goin’ On was the name of the song, hoe
The California Livin’ got me On My Toes
I’m Y-double-B out the family tree of them Crest Macs
The Romper Room, Crew Thang, Loced Out and the SES Fac
Now the Crestside Country Club ballers and baby thugs
My nigga came home and the ‘more showed love
But he back up in yo’ face representin’ the Bay
So peep game from my cuddie, playa potna Mac Dre
