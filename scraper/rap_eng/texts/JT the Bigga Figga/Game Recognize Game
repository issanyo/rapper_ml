Bucked around and fucked around made another hit
Comin' again from the top about to tell ya about this  shit
This shit that I'm poppin, game is what I'm choppin
Never underestimate the mack when he rockin'
Cause me and Mac Mall standing tall for tha trey
On our way from tha Bay so what tha fuck you got to   say
Game recognize game is tha way tha shit flow
Break tha beat down, smoke a dub and Get Low
Vicious as I come cause I come kinda vicious
Missing little snitches cause you know I'm about to   spit this
Rhyme for tha number nine nigga
Grab your gat cock tha hammer back and pull tha    trigger
Squatting in the buck buck cause I don't give a fuck
Puffin' on the blunt now ya know I'm kinda stuck
So when ya hear me goin' bust a move and Get Low
Recognize game cause your boy about to flow

(Chorus)

(Mac Mall)
Game recognize game, in tha bay mane
And bitches jock for cash, this shit'll never change
So I maintain and always keep my gat on my lap
For tha simple fact the grind is low so niggas jack
But I can give a fuck about a P.H
My clip pack thirty, so watch me decay
A captain save-a-ho and watch him fall to the turf
And my cuddies gone beat him to a burst
Can't put him in a herse the trunk of a chevy let him  squeeze
And them I'm going sess-ways throwing up tha ST's ST's  SP's
I went to Frisco and smoked about a O
And now I'm in tha studio feelin' two-toed
Wit JT The Bigga Figga
Came up wit a rap and a beat to get the
Hoes on a fuck and the niggas wanna thump
Blaze the blunt, blaze the blunt
And watch me and JT smoke the track
My mug on mean as I stack, mothafucka
Lil sucker (Yeah ho)
