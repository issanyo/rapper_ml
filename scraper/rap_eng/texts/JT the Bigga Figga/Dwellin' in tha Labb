[Verse 1]
Totally my mind on my mission, fishin’ in the sea
Dwellin’ in the lab, tryna stack my G’s
Quicker than the thoughts of a rebel in disguise
Many opportunities, surprise surprise
Evolvin’, revolvin’ around the dough
24-7, it’s time to flow
For the next episode, I’ma kick it like this
With the twist of the wrist of a total eclipse
Now, shine influential, got much potential
Bustin’ freestyles over funk instrumentals
No thang, more game for an example
Step in the way of progress, you getting trampled
Kick the facts so I can set the track straight
Breaking down game for the fools who tried to playa hate
Play your post with the brotha most
Back in your face for the ’95 season with another dose

[Chorus]
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s

[Verse 2]
Back it up, back it in, let me begin
With the fortified funk in my gold-plated pen
That’s the way it goes ‘cause the fetti’s demandin’
Fools get mad because I’m steady expandin’
Never did they know that I’ma break it on down
Headin’ into the lab to create my own sound
Break out the track, represent like the keys
To the scales with the funk, 36 OZ’s
‘Cause the water starts to boil, cook it down to the DAT
No sign of baking soda so it comes back fat
Got my slot in the shade, razor blade and I’m choppin’
More stops at retail, they fiend to be coppin’
I mean to poppin’, you know that I’ll be ridin’
Posted in the lab, you know it’s time for stridin’
From a 16 channel to a 48 track
So you know I kick facts, so just step on back

[Chorus]
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s

[Verse 3]
Excellent when I represent, take a hit
Capable, unbreakable when I spit
The gift that I got from the Most High
Don’t try to deviate from the plan, you wonder why
Master the ride, the one in control
The one with your life, the one with your soul
You best’a recognize ‘fore you end up mad
Giving thanks and praise when I’m dwellin’ in the lab

[Chorus]
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7
(“Comin’ to kick the fizacts for you playas”)
Dwellin’ in my labb, 24-7 ‘cause the playas in the game be stackin’ them G’s
