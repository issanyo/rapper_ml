[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I'm a god in the city of god I'm a dog in New Orleans a don in B-R
Show in Detroit I don't need no semi when the drink online I'm a buy too many
OK, really when I felt like dying went hard couldn't cry but the pain ain't ended
Emotional strains, strain ain't endin'
These niggas pretending, fuck is you gettin'
See it in my eyes I'm a soldier really
These teardrops don't make me serious
They just tell a story, consider me a poet
On parole ain't no ego
Fell in love with a stripper could you blame me for it
Baby just lie don't tell me the truth
Truth still hurt and my heart is still proof
Never loved no bitch I ain't part of no crew
Everybody 'round look 'em dead in the eyes
When trouble come 'round they 'gon turn on you
Turn on who, I'm a hold it down for my niggas in the pen doin' life won't change up
When I tell my brother Mazi that I love 'em he don't ever say it back to a nigga before the phone hang up
Hope a nigga know that if he touch what I love on the hush motherfucker you 'gon give your brain up

[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Me... You
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do
Runnin' 'round my city on flu
Niggas don't want no brew
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do

[Verse: JT the Bigga Figga]
I'm Cali bound
Motivated
Flow contagious I've been gone for days
And every day I've been on I got the song amazing
Got my apron on I got the blow appraising
I cut the check, check is cut
Send in my homies to get the register
It's only a strong arm the weapon tucked
I'm very involved so learn your lesson bruh
Who think that you was creepin' on
Who you think that you was speakin' on
Kick in your face until your teeth is gone
I got Dr. Dre's you got your speakers blown
I'm kind hearted
Kickstarted
I'm a real nigga, not a Messy Marvin
Want a real price, not a grocery bargain
Don't shop at Target I'm a ball regardless
Fillmore niggas are just some of the hardest
While I'm a whoopin' a nigga, right in front of the garbage
And I'm a signing a deal, taking his artist
And I'm countin' the money on a Persian carpet
When I left the block, [?] breath again
Coke, weed, molly having Jesus [?]
It ain't like a nigga don't need the ends
I don't need a bitch and I don't need a Benz

[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Me... You
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do
Runnin' 'round my city on flu
Niggas don't want no brew
Every Little Thing I Do
Every Little Thing I Do
