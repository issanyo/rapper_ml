Ahh, marvelous, we're finna do this again

[Verse 1:  D-Moe]
Victim of the vapes, or should I say vapors?
Now in nine-deuce, young niggas makin' paper
Hoes on the dick, niggas on the nuts too
But I ain't really trippin' to you marks sayin' "Fuck you"
Back in the days, you was trippin' on me
Sidin' in your cars, steady dippin' on me
But see in nine-deuce a young brotha straight clownin'
Smokin' on dank, makin' bank, ride clean, you know loungin'
And your bitch'll get slammed like dominoes
'Cause you know, me and JT, yeah, you know we poppin' hoes
But at first it was a thang to you
Had to talk and walk and pop game to you
But here in this day and age, niggas make cash flow
Top-notch hoochies, late night turf hoes
All get fucked when the crew come through
Some on dank, some on chew'
Some on brew, others on Hennessy
Grand Marnier, Tanqueray, gin and juice, G
Hoes in the crowd all wanna seduce me
Big time ballers wanna talk and produce me
But naw, it ain't like that, my pockets already fat
Fool you wanna jack, I'm packin' a chrome gat
Punk mothafuckas can't fade the youngsta
Bitch-type bustas, them hoes a hustler
Fools know what happens when the 'moe's on the rampage
Comin' out the sunroof, bustin' with a twelve gauge
It ain't shit but a thing to me
'Cause a gang of y'all fools can't hang with me
But back to the goddamn peach
While bitches and niggas pay a fee to see me
A nigga named [?] born in Frisco
Fillmore, smokin' on indo, hangin' out the window
Clownin' all the turf hoes
Sippin' on a four-oh
And poppin' that Five-O
Now he made a date, holdin' that vape
Now they searchin' for the Vogues and the clean candy paints
Niggas wanna play me, but fool, I ain't goin' out
I'm throwin' these dogs well, and I can buck niggas out
And I'm about to rip shit up
For you [?] who want to slob on a nut
Me and JT make gangsta shit
[?] in the cut, about to pop the clip
Niggas [?] smokin' dank and drank and juice
Drop the top, hide the Glock, let's make the move
To the top and don't stop 'til we major
Niggas that are bigga, droppin' flava, gettin' vapors
To you mothafuckin' stank hoes
Low rank hoes sheistin' on a young nigga's bank roll
Mack 'til we're bitches, young black gangstas
Gold 'n Vogues, material hoes
Swingin' from the nuts of a nigga makin' G
Who was known, for slingin' MZs
I mean shit, summertime [?]
With the dank and drank, 'cause the nigga needs a hit
Fuck the niggas and bitches that want to see a brotha fade
You know, victim of the vapes

[Verse 2:  JT The Bigga Figga]
Niggas kept sayin' "JT" (JT)
"Why don't you put your pen down and stick with the D?"
And quit tryin' to be a rapper
Keep [?] stealin' cars and bustin' caps at
Suckas in your neighborhood
And keep livin' your life up to no good
Fuck, a jealous ass, broke ass nigga
Straight ass-kissin', no-cock gettin'
[?] as stick to my balls at a party
'Cause I'm smokin' dank, clockin' bank and drinkin' Grand Marny
Fuck that shit, hoes on my dick
So you want to be in our click?
So you can roll non-stoppin'
Yo we havin' hoes, makin' money and we poppin'
But it don't work that way
Not your way, but my way, so niggas now what you wanna say
I remember rollin' up in a limo
I asked a mothafucka, to listen to the demo
Getto Boys was rockin', UMC was next
Hoes in the crowd, was givin' up sex
Quick, quicker than the quickest
Talkin' to the bitch, because the bitch was the thickest
Knowin' I'm a mack, a player in the game
I gotta do my thang and show no mothatfuckin' shame
Yeah I'm The Bigga Figga, comin' out of Frisco
You know I gotta let 'em know, this is how we do it in the 'moe
But when it come to rhymin', you know I can't fake it
But some young punks don't want to see us make it
Feelin' my flow, like they drinkin' on juice
Bumpin' the bass on a Zap' or a Zeus
Talkin' 'bout my lyrics, oh yeah I found 'em
They're high as a mountain, our beats are poundin'
And I keep rockin', and you can't stop 'em
And every concert man we gonna shock it
The Zeniths, the Vogues, the players the hoes
They everywhere you go in the city of Frisco
The macks, the homies, the brothas, the fellas
The broke mothafuckas is the ones who's jealous
'Cause a few wanna see the downfall of the MOB
But as you all know, misery love company
So go to the store and get the CD and tapes
This is goin' out to the victim of the vapes
Biatch

[Outro: The Little Figga]
Fuck that
It ain't no thing to me
It's The Little Figga nigga
You know what I'm sayin', huh
Yeah, The Little Figga
Poppin' that shit
For the '92
Ha, yeah, for my nigga D-Moe, boy, he tore that shit up
My nigga JT came through with that, you know what I'm sayin', he done that
So, uh, hold on, let me see, I gotta rap something
Yeah, it's The Little Figgaa, comin' through
And my nigga The Bigga Figga
Poppin' that shit
And we outta here for the '92 bitch
