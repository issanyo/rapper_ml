[Intro - JT the Bigga Figga (talking)]
It ain't nuthin' like that Mob Life..

[JT the Bigga Figga]
It ain't nuthin' like that Mob Life
Putting it down, young niggas mayne doing it twice
Coming through with the throughest rights
Nigga understand, eighty bars nigga four hundred grand
Ain't talking about that real shit, talking bout that filthy Fill-moe
Get the steal shit, put it down, get the deal bitch
You betta know the game
JT the Bigga Figga mayne, throw them flames
Put it down with the gamblers, handle the rock
Assassin in the cuts mayne, ready to pop
We ain't popping with no pistols, we popping with game
Putting it down nigga, the money train
Like I told you last song, this shit is so real
Putting it down mayne, trying to get the skreal
Call me J-T Figga roll, hold them birds
From Fill-more to the Dirty Jerz, serving them words

[Chorus (x2) - Cablez]
It ain't nuthin' like that Mob Life
Fill-moe and Derty Jerz niggas get right
We stack chips, stay on point cause our game tight
East coast, west coast, Mob Life nigga, Get Low!

[Cablez]
From the east to the west, niggas feel my shit
I move in and out of hoods, just to stack my chips
Niggas recognize the realest, when I spit my shit
I'm my own hood legend, and an industry rookie
So you know I got the hood locked, nah kid I won't stop
Even when shit get heavy, dog we on top
J-T and you know the kid Cablez
We make moves that these niggas can't handle

[Chorus (x2) - Cablez]
It ain't nuthin' like that Mob Life
Fill-moe and Derty Jerz niggas get right
We stack chips, stay on point cause our game tight
East coast, west coast, Mob Life nigga, Get Low!

[Cablez]
You know how my niggas on the west side do it
Thugging with they converse and they khaki suits
We over here on the east, with jeans and wife b's
Some ill ass Nikes, and a long ass white tee
No matter how you put it, from the east to the west
We all in the same hustle, the same struggle
Only real ass niggas get money together
Player haters talk shit but never step in the game
I made my fame, thats why niggas know my name
Blood in, blood out, I'mma ride for my team nigga

[Chorus (x2) - Cablez]
It ain't nuthin' like that Mob Life
Fill-moe and Derty Jerz niggas get right
We stack chips, stay on point cause our game tight
East coast, west coast, Mob Life nigga, Get Low!

[Outro - Cablez (talking)]
Mob Life Records, motherfucker
Get Low Records nigga
It's your boy Cablez
JT the Bigga Figga
My nigga Hella Tight with the banger kid
Yeah we here now, believe that
We out
