[Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it (I'm just sayin' you could do better)
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this (Tell me, have you heard that lately?)
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I (I'm just sayin' you could do better)
Beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same (And I'll start hatin' only if you make me)

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Drake]
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Say my name
Say my name

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Drake]
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
