(feat. Cheryl T. "Wifey")

[Intro: music]

[Chorus:]
I think you better fall back (Whoa) Fall back
You ain't gettin money she ain't tryna rap
Kin Folk fall back (Whao) Fall back
To get with her mane you gotta have stacks (stacks)
Don't play with her (don't play with her)
She serious (Oh)
Don't play with her (don't play with her)
She serious
Don't play with her (don't play with her)
She serious (Oh)
Don't play with her (don't play with her)
She serious

[Kia Shine:]
She got vouton on her arm true allisions on her a**
She run her own business and she make her own cash
She got her own car and she got her own pad
If you ain't talking bout money conversation won't last
If you ain't got no guoop then you probably won't smash
And if she let you pop then you know what she gone ask
Where the where the cash at she ain't being funny
This is how she grin this is how she get her money
She love go-getters that really go get it (really go get it)
The rose mo-cycles that hit the club crispy
In them fresh a** whips like the x-550, or that fresh drop bently
Or that new 750, or that super charge raine it's the super charge daines
She got a super job all she do is charge lane, listen to me mane
I'm tryna put you up on game, (game) if you f**k with her she gone charge
You out the frame

[Chorus]
(Go play with some body else) (Aight)

[Kia Shine:]
See I'm a fly dude, I kno fly sh*t, if I kno anythang, I kno a fly bi**h (Aight)
No matter what state what race what color, like her, (right over there)
She fresher than a motherfu**er
Her stanna frames on, she stay behind tint, she see pass you niggas
That's 99%, and wut I mean by 99 is that you ain't 100
Ain't talking bout no gal, I'm talking bout a real woman (real woman)
Who ain't messin with ya less she makin real money, cause don't no gal want
No dude that ain't doing nothin
She see you broke from a mile away she see you coming
Before you open up yo mouth before she know you stunt'n
So save all yo game and yo cheezy lines, she ain't messin with you
Playa don't even waste yo time, (waste yo time)
She f**k with real niggas, that's really on their grind
Unless you getting it like Kia Shine you better fall back

[Chorus]
[Kia Shine:]
Kin Folk
If you ain't gettin that money
She don't want cha (she don't want cha)
She don't want cha (she don't want cha)
And if you ain't stacking that paper
She don't need cha (she don't need cha)
She don't need cha (she don't need cha
If you ain't gettin that money
I don't want cha (I don't want cha)
I don't want cha (I don't want cha)
And if you ain't stacking that paper
I don't need cha (I don't need cha)
I don't need cha (I don't need cha

[Wifey:]
They call me wifey I'm miss. mary inage
I hold it down at home and I take care all the business
So messing with that hattin and that she can rap shh
Don't under estimate me ain't cha average rap
When no one was around I had em down right grouted but now
We coming up and all these girls made at me
Ya boys ain't half of me so don't even start
Wifey's got a man (I got a man) plus wifey got heart

[Chorus]
[Wifey:]
You ain't talking bout nothing, mane we all gettin money
And it ain't no thang to me
