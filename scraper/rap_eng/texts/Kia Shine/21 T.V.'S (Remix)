[Verse 1: Kia Shine]
( And here we go)
It's yo boy Nakia Shine
Y'all can suck that in
And that boy got the money look at the truck he in
Icy White tire hold with the vet engine
Before you ask yes, them 24 inches
On a slab lady night with them halogen lights
See my diamonds grippin' with them, 15 carats [that's bright?]
Turn my TV's on and I lit up the road
Put my CD's on and I lit up the dro
Purple Chess-a-berry, Icy White Burberry
Next one I got the Icy White Fer-rari
24's on my tire, they'll make your heart stop
Holla at my nigga Boo-Goo, louvit hard rock
Icy White candle, Icy white cell phone
You lose, you fuckin' with Shine, that's what I tell hoes
Bout to hit Melrose, catch a bite on Northwest
Rap hustlers, Icy White quartets

[Verse 2: Skinny Pimp]
Dre bake, Jack Frost the boss of everytown
No matter where I go, Fo' Sho' I shut it down
Watch me ball out, till I fall out
Fuck what it cost I'm buying the mall out
Icy White Headbands, Icy White tens
Icy White Air-force Ones, on my [Feet]
That's street apparel, cousin, don't get it fooled
My attire got more Jazz than Karl Malone
I hit the spot X poppin', Ho knockin'
I don't gotta speak, Slow bunnies come hoppin'
Jones if a carat, that's around my arm, or in my ear, or in my charm
These hoes Icy White, nigga that's my life
When I pull up at the club it's a hell of a sight
In a Icy White Jeep Wagon with TVs, My rims grown men
That just turned into a machine
[Hook: Kia Shine]
[Verse 3:Yo Gotti]
Memphis, Tennessee finnatech young town
North Memphis niggas in this bitch shake down
Air Force Ones, Reeboks laced tight
If you wanna start a fight step on the Icy Whites
