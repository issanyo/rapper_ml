(Verse 1 - B-Real)
See the meteoric rise, see we going for a ride
Yeah we never looking back, we keep our eye on the prize
Like the harvest, cut you down to size
Put the dab on the nail, dry 'em out, give 'em California highs
Need a dose? I can give it too ya, load you up on jet fuel
Fly you fuckin' outta here, fuckin' with your mental
See it's on, when it's on and it's on in ninety-forty packs in the trunk
Po-po flow behind me
I don't care, I'm the doctor, I'm silk like the shocker
Got the bitches smoking hard, baked out like Betty Crocker
Put my foot in your ass like I stored it in the foot locker
Rep my fucking city like the vest with the bottom rocker

(Chorus/Hook - Ab-Soul & B-Real)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words can never harm me (Keep talking)
No sticks no seeds up in my weed
The prettiest penny what it cost me (Blaze it up)
I hope you got a couple iron lungs in yo' chest because (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)

(Verse 2 - Ab-Soul)
Everywhere I go I'm smokin' dope
Is my name So-High or is it Soulo?
When you on top of the game they want you to throw 'em rope
You get hung tryna hang out
I'm Willie Lynch in reverse
You show boat but should've bought a yacht first
When the loud around you in the death row, like a Pac verse
Ya heard me? What the business is?
My niggas curry chicken in the coup like Carribeans
Angel wings on a villains back
That's how I rap
And when I travel I never pack without the pack
Hit Dr. Greenthumb to schedule an appointment
He told me smoke two zips and call him in the morning

(Chorus/Hook - Ab-Soul & B-Real)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words can never harm me (Keep talking)
No sticks no seeds up in my weed
The prettiest penny what it cost me (Blaze it up)
I hope you got a couple iron lungs in yo' chest because (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)

(Verse 3 - B-Real)
Listen to Mike, do a hundred dabs
Get the nail hot, bitch got the finest slabs
Throw your flowers in the air, it's up for grabs
Now your face is gettin' tighter, I'm cuttin' shit with dabs
We get 'em high like the holy ghost
Batman smokin' kush, thinkin' holy smokes
Got you faded out while your homies joke
Give you the prescription, hit the loud while your homies choke

Hey yo Ab, keep the engine running
Lace around the weed like its the Vikings and the Indians comin'
Funky feels on the tip, come on hit it
Takin' out your suckers, and you don't know how I did it

Throw me out a window cause I'm real stoned
David slew Goliath when he threw me at his fuckin' dome (owch)
Brick top, you get mopped tonight and guarantee
No one's gonna say a thing, hear a pin drop

(Chorus/Hook - Ab-Soul & B-Real)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words can never harm me (Keep talking)
No sticks no seeds up in my weed
The prettiest penny what it cost me (Blaze it up)
I hope you got a couple iron lungs in yo' chest because (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)
I told you (This right here is not a test)
