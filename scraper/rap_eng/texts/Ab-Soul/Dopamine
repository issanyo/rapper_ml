I want to show you/How we do/Just to get you wired/We load'em up/Shoot'em up/Smoking'em Up/Who's dope as us?/We load'em up/Shoot'em up/Smoke'em up/We dope as fuck

F.Y.I. aka Foreshadow (Verse #1):

Welcome to major league big ball Manute Bol Too tall
Foolish n*ggas Fool ya'll with Foosball Saw'em dancing
Soft and cuddly While I'm romancing Beautiful flows Against Foes
Often ugly Grimey with it Step out of tubs And see patterns Ears ring
Astonishing buzz Keeps me on Saturn
Light Years Ahead of these bars So I'm a handle'em
We eat the weak Tell these tortillas nias It's a wrap
No pitiful penmanship Lost souls stroll the globe
Searching for genesis Get wisdom in an aged word
Far from a caged pterodactyl I was meant to crack you in fly fedoras
Bright feathers My life is Barnum Bailey crazy Freaks with tight leathers want a spanking
I smack her dominant And turn her ass dominatrix
Fiends asking Foreshadow can you help us?
We see your splash nigga Michael Phelp us

Chorus 2x

Ab-Soul (Verse #2):

You know how we do Oversee you Are we top dawgs or bald eagles?
Hiiipower in your mouth Shoelaces in your ass
Especially if you print my name without the dash In between the b and the s
And I ain't taking no BS from bitch You know me man The worst thing you can do is think you have a chance
That is unless you playing monopoly with your friends Then I'd understand
As for this rap thing You wouldn't kill a bowl of cereal I'm the Son of Sam
I'm CRUCIAL Who's dope as us? We dope as fuck? We stick'em up
Then we sprinkle sodium on open cuts Ab-Soul and Those Chosen You need to quit
Close colon No shit Wait One Moment Who's dope as us?/We dope as fuck
You running low on dopamine You'll never be as dope as me....SOUL

Chorus 2x

KornBread (Verse #3):

Critically acclaimed Soliloquies of flames No pity for these lames In the city of the gangs Shush-bang!
Any opposers Watching for the cobras Keep'em on they toes Like some corudroy crokers
Something like Jonas In the belly of the beast Told the homies that I'm on it
Put the own its on me I'll never come back with empty hands I bring heat
OT on a mission Blowing grams of some keef To my tribe I'm chief They call me Cochise
On some Coolie High fly shit But poppa don't preach To these prima donnas
Battle ready No kinks in armour 4 Finty popper Goonie Cyndi Lauper
Cause time after time Niggas want to test your kindness So I'm coming for they pride Leaving with they hyenas
Never look behind us I live in foresight Clairvoyant Amethyst An uncut diamond

Chorus 2x

Japetto (Verse #4):

Developed an addiction for the lines that I wrote Customers on every coast
O.D.'ing on every quote Provide the right prescription
Supply and Demand This high quality brand Got fans waving they hands
The sound of my voice Can take your lady friend paradise
Check the record One track can change your life From zombie to angels
Fitted caps to Kangols We be the connect Ya'll niggas chase rainbows
Fear the storm Those Chosen beyond the norm Beat junkies with a habit Wack n*ggas been warned See and feel the magic every time we go on
Craving The vibe of the song is strong You leaving spaced out like rocket You hear the logic
We have substance You get abused when we drop it You want it
We got it for whoever needs a fixed Catch me after the flow You know they move quick

Chorus 2 x
