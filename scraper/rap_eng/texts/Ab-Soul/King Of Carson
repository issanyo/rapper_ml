[Hook]
Alert, covert operation
Competition is runnin' scared, we runnin' it
Cups out, blunts up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
C-AR-son where you at?
C-AR-son where you at?
We ridin' on 746 shit, ya dig
East side
East side east side, come on
East side, come on, east side, come on
West side
West side west side, come on
West side, come on, west side, come on
South side
South side south side, come on
South side, come on, south side, come on
North side
North side north side, come on
North side, come on, north side, come on

[Verse 1]
Alert, covert operation
I'm gettin' way too much observation
Like a test tube, can't even use the restroom
Without a camera snappin' at me like a mousetrap
Do, do that, soul brother number deuce
Hip hop king, shout out to King Blue
For bringin' me food
Yeah I eat beats on GP like guys property
In all honesty I gotta be the greatest
I gotta be the greatest like a cut dog
Rollin' on the corner on daytons
I gotta be the greatest, I gotta be the greatest
Put that crown down, you got next I got now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, can I fuck it up
Throw my city up, regurgitate it on your latest until you give it up
I got it covered like quilts
And you couldn't block me if you was Wilt on stilts
This is where I was built, this is where I was made
This where I put it down, this where I was raised
You wouldn't understand, it's a Carson thing
Use your head homeboy, it might cost your brain
I'm on Carson street across the street
From the motherfuckin' [?] incarcen me
If all else fails, call Carson me
Ab-Soul de Lamo, God knows

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Told y'all
A-B-A, D-A baby
CA sunshine, but I'm cool in the AC
05 Carson High, the classic classes
I told you to raise your glasses, the doja
Got my head spinnin' like 10 Tazes
And when I'm dead tell 'em I spread
Carson to the masses like mayonaise on sandwich bread
Who askin'? Tell 'em I said
One more time
