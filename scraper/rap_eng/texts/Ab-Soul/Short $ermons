[Verse 1: RetcH]
Seduce dykes in the moonlight, I move like
Them cats that wear two strikes, at night I blew dice
Cee-lo, you know he 'Lo like a hero
Turn zeros into C-notes fucking with Nino
A tree blow in the beam-o, I lean low
The grill is looking like it's cheesing, so appeasing
Catch me leaning, leather seats is heated
Jump out the zenith, that's a naked skeezer
She with whatever, predict the weather
Distressed leather under vintage sweater
Resemble cheddar, the centerpiece is clever
The endeavors of a young cadaver
I roll the reefer, read the prison letter
Free my mans [and them]
With more beaches with the Jordans with the sand in them
I'm on the premises with pouches with the grams in them
'Lo socks, boxers with the dick-hole
The tea was fresh up out the kettle, so I sip slow, whoa

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Black lip pastor, don't know if my raps or a gat spit faster
The horror in my oral vernacular'll collapse ya
Fellatio in the Uber if the driver's cooler
We got it in, sheâ€™s no Karrine, but the head was super
Intended for it to be intricate for me to lose her
But she in love with a loser
My bitch friend snooping through my Instagram
When I'd much rather crack a Backwood and twist a gram
Me and 'Lo God we both gods below God
Pick up line for divas that I'm Jesus with a bigger penis
Shout out to Lord Legend, shout out Apostle Agent
The games Nebuchadnezzar and I'm just Daniel dreaming
Or maybe David in a lion's den, with a plate of steak
Don't make the same mistake, I'm blowing dumb trees
State to state and out the country
Accidentally ashing on my Polo, getting dome from yo' ho
Soulo
