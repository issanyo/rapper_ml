[Ab-Soul]
Yo, check, Sway
Sinister literature
Read my rhythms, it'll get rid of you
Quicker than Ritalin
Redbones leave me with a ridden stick
How real is this?
Think of cinammon cinema, sweet
'Til the serpent serves you the vinegar, it's deep
Simple as finding algorithms in statistics
Walking with your children in the red light district
Look at me, dancing with Alori's ghost
Hope I don't got two left feet
You know I love you momma
Keep my ear to the street
Concrete jungle at the top
Dog eat dog homie, stay humble
If it'll be, it'll be
Damn straight, my plan A was to beat up a beat
Put words together like Scrabble, dazzle a audience
At first it sounded like babble but now it all makes sense
I brought it round full circle for y'all squares
Bad to the bone
You goodie-two-shoes couldn't compare, yeah
If fair's fair, I'm the air
Not next to the king, but what you breath
You may not see, but believe me, I'm there
Just inspiration, I been here before
I'm on my 777th incarnation
Soul
