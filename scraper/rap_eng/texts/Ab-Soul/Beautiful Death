[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
My only fear is fear itself
I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself
Niggas lookin' at me like I don't hear myself
Like I don't know pain, I been here myself
This life will drive you crazy – only if you let it
I'm just an American expressin', give me some credit
Won't be surprised if before I rise I'm beheaded
These are the days of our lives
Nightmares of a thief comin', takin' my life
I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up
In this reality at least I keep my bed made up
I just wish they all could see what I can see
If we could stop it with the violence
And apply a lil' logic, I believe
We could thrive to be a promising civilization
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time until it's our time

[Hook: Ash Riser]
Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die

[Verse 2: Ab Soul]
All I see is confusion and chaos
Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me
And got me often thinkin' about offing me
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' broke, and even worse
The upper class act like they don't want me on this earth
This life will drive you crazy – only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward, and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand? Who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand!
You could be the victor in this situation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's our time, until it's our time

[Hook: Ash Riser]
Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die

[Verse 3: Punch]
Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shootin' back on the balcony
Escapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Alpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga, show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitchin' in his genes
Accordin' to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture to its very being
It's not political, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Tragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece
Put down your piece!
I wish you all a beautiful death — peace!
