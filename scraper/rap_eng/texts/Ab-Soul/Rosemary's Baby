[Verse 1]
Hotdamn, hoe, here we go again
Black Lip Pastor at the podium
Called in the Guns and Roses I roll in my hands
Even got the logo tatted on my skin
And I've been livin' so wicked
I ain't got no intention on repentin' for my sins
These Hades be hatin' on a nigga
Hades be hatin' on a nigga, man
Had your wifey come again just to cum again
Make her twerk for some merch for her boyfriend
Clear my guilty conscious cause he was a fan
It could happen to me if it can happen to him
These Hades be hatin' on a nigga
Hades be hatin' on a nigga, man
Luckily I feel like Hercules
Eye for an eye, that's why I got 3, rest in peace

[Hook]
I brought the Gods back for you
Treat the microphone like the rod of Moses
Looking into the burning bushes hoping they talk back to me but they never talk back to me
And I ain't a false prophet, I'm just makin' real profit off the E
This my Dead Sea Scroll flow
They respectin' him like the Nephilim, Hercules
Hercules, call me Hercules
I brought the Gods back for you
They call me Hercules, Hercules
I brought the Gods back for you, hoe

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers motherfuckin' with the motherfucker
Really fuckin' mothers up in other countries
Undercover semis, mothers fuckin' love it, ho
47 karat gold, I'm the one that threw Prometheus a lifesaver
All my lines are breathtaking
Gladiator, packed stadium, they came to see Hercules
You in a hearse, and it's the universe versus me
Are you not entertained, is this not why you are here?
When you look yourself in a mirror, do you appear?
Would you hold a world on your shoulders that wouldn't do the same for you?
Snake the snakes that came to snake you?
Who mixed my cannibus with tannis root?
Cause Hades be hatin' on a nigga, man
The creature's baby was an angel, not an Adrian
She came out of labor saying, "damn"

[Hook]
I brought the Gods back for you
Treat the microphone like the rod of Moses
Sink into the burnin' bushes so they talk back to me
They never talk back to me
And I ain't a false prophet, I'm just makin' real profit off the E
This my Dead Sea Scroll flow
They respectin' him like the Nephilim, Hercules
Hercules, call me Hercules
I brought the Gods back for you
They call me Hercules, Hercules
I brought the Gods back for you, hoe
