Set the night on fire
Righteous white lighter
The lone lifer
As I'm gazin' at the flame of the tip of my blunt

Reduce to small talkers

The science behind rockets
Mean medians and modes
Theorems and postulates
Mixing lean in the beaker
This is preposterous
Loch ness monster on the mic, you know what time it is
When givings better than receiving, heres why
If we all giving that means we all got - if the god decides not

[Asaad]

Sick beast from the half-life capital
Sick at elle and a weed killer
Smoking like a vegan
Choking like im breathing
Open like a ceasing
In a room with no ceiling
Enlighten was the feeling

Its javota (?) when our worlds collide
Manifest a finesses a man up on the dress up again a protect collector
Rare tea city
Penny a perks a many
Bathing Ape meets Fendi (?)
Count baseball money smoking bats
My nigga doe burger slid on me with the pack
Black lip pastor

Four foot prints in the sand where ether I stand
