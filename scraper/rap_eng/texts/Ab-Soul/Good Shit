[Verse 1: NIGHTLIFE]

(Yeah) Grizz
Humble yourself (Yeah)
Or somebody else will (Yeah)
Look
If it's not mine man fuck it
Then I don't want it
Working my ass off
I've been running
My circle so small
I've been talking to myself
I don't trust a soul
N- I don't trust a soul n-
Look
Why you wanna talk if there's nothing to talk about
Watch out how you talk to me
I swear I'm get loud
Hard work beats talent on any given day
Look at what happened Rodney fills
Look at what happened Rodney fills

[Chorus]

Losers make excuses
Winners make it happen
Good Shit
I'm a man of my word
Fuck what you heard
Good Shit
Good Shit (x10)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]

(It's all to the good my n-)
Soul!
If it ain't mine dog
I'm a tell you right off Top
Motherf- a handout, shout outs to BC the block
This that win in team
You can't fuck with them rocks
(No they ain't fuckin' with Soul x2)
These days... I reinstate these systems of control
Cause these n- out of control
Yeah these b- out of control
In this concrete Jumanji this fame will make you go cray
(Seen what happened to Robin Will x2)
Backwoods, back to back (That Good Shit, that Good Shit)
My b- bad, Her b- bad, her b- bad (I'm juking)
Once again this the win in team so I never lost, G
P.S get lost
Peace
