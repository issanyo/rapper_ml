[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you'll enjoy as this much as I do
Are we ready? I am
'Cause it's all about control, and I've got lots of it

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho, the one and only
You niggas know me, your bitches want me
Determination, I got a grip
9-5 locs, I am not a Crip
Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers
Your short-term tall tales won't sell here
And Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here
Let me get a "hell yeah"

[Hook: (Jhené Aiko) & Ab-Soul]
(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is
(It's about that time) Soulo on one again
(It's been a hell of a ride) You niggas know what it is
(We live one hell of a life) Say Soulo on one again
I'm still on my shit
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, they still on my dick
You niggas know what it is
(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is
(It's about that time) Soulo on one again

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, manipulatin' minds
Reciprocatin' time spent on my amazin' rise
Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon
We can see you half-steppin', I should somersault
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
'Cause I really did everything I say I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
The same reason why I'm stressed
The same reason why I'm blessed
I stopped prayin' and I started plannin'
I stopped playin' and I made it happen
We mapped it out and now the map is ours
Raised my stats all from records, check an almanac
Thank God, Punchline knew I had a knack
Down to die to get my point across like craps
Control System, cut off your radios, cut off your television

[Hook: (Jhené Aiko) & Ab-Soul]
(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is
(It's about that time) Soulo on one again
(It's been a hell of a ride) You niggas know what it is
(We live one hell of a life) Say Soulo on one again
I'm still on my shit
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, they still on my dick
You niggas know what it is
(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is
(It's about that time) Soulo on one again

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Truth, I'm turnin' their heads and I'm earnin' respect
Grinnin' 'cause niggas ain't know I was next
Pinnin' this shit in the wind, literate as Oscar Wilde
Bringin' the terror and tearin' the concert down
The spliff will get lit up 'til we look like we come from Chinatown
Missin' Alori Joh, it's been a minute since I saw her smile
She's the reason why I go as hard as I do now
Fuck a foe 'cause I'm focused as four bifocals
I'm prone to leave a vocal booth totaled for the right total
The bad boy, you boys pussy as Total
Or Dorothy's dog Toto, I'm tellin' niggas
I'ma need a few wings like Frodo, I can't say YOLO
Because I've been here before, so def that I've been reborn, Soulo

[Outro: (Jhené Aiko) & Ab-Soul]
(Open your eyes) I know you can see me
(It's about that time) They ain't goin' believe me
(It's been a hell of a ride) Nothin' was given
(We live one hell of a life) We still livin'
