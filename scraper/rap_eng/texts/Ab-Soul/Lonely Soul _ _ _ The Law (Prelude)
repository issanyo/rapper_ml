[Part 1: Lonely Soul]

[Intro: Thundercat]
I am a lonely soul, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone (You gotta think for yourself, this is it)
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I'm conflicted to my amazement, I'm just amazed
Slim, silver spoon in my mouth
Spoiled little Carson kid with chandelier up in my shed
Future's looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
Uh, cause Punch told me to punch him in the face
Make a statement, lead slaves to salvation with my way with words
I kept the Soul in the alphabet
The alpha-male in my era, I'm here to baffle them like the Baphomet
They ain't know what the cover of my second album meant
I'm in the booth if I'm asking you where the bathroom at
Before the whole wide world eye balled Top Dawg
They wouldn't even give this cat a rack to perform
Sure Lori was more than empathetic
But the seven hundred I got took her to Lawry's instead of IHOP
My high-school sweetheart turned my ticker so bitter
Still staying strong for Ray, CJ, and all our little sisters
Vaneesha just had Jaleel, that's my third nephew
Cory's adorable and Cody still missed you
All my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
If you was Nuit you would know what I mean (Nuit!)
Hundred proof Absolut in the back of your Acura
Donny Hathaway on repeat
My mentor asked me "what happens after Control System?"
Wanted to tell him "the system controls me," please

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
They can't hate, they don't want
They can't take it
Long lost member of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Getting high with a little bit of help from my friends
The rifles to my rivals all my homies got a homie
That bodied one of my homies, yo that cycle is psycho
A coward killed my brother Jorgiano and his momma
And I'm complaining about a album, what is my problem?

[Interlude: Punch]
Soulo, you know God was alone for eternity?
Yet he wasn't lonely
You gotta love, love is create
Create, create

[Verse 3: Punch]
They shot Mirelli Pervis in the face
He survived due to God's grace
Ironically him and my uncle share the same birthday
Is it fate or is it faith?
I just might be in your hood still
Lonely soul itching for a love that I've once known but I've outgrown it
I told Famous be patient, I'm in the hills
While this world is caving in and I'm living a vacation
Or so it seems, to the wig it's all in
Won't hesitate to find a coffin to make these niggas crawl in
I tried to stall him but I ain't have no alternative
I told him to think smart, he told me get it how I live
Point taken, Lord, why have you forsaken us?
Blasting at Satan for salvation, feels Pagan
Graced in the Land of Canaan
But my new world translation speaks of a different arrangement
When Death meets death, eternal breath fills my lungs
Death forever paid in the name of God's son
Currently wasting away in this wicked system
Scared to pray for forgiveness cause I ain't sure if I repent it
Oh what an existence
In fact is this really living?
Drowning in my own expenses
While tryna make Soul listen to my infinite wisdom

[Outro: Ab-Soul & SZA]
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

[Part 2: The Law (Prelude)]

[SZA]
Love is the law, love is the lovely law
Love is the law, lovely love
Love is the law, lovely is the lovely
Love is the, love is the, love is the, love is the
