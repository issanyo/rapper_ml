[Verse 1]
Your momma told me read the Book of Job
They shoulda called it the Book of Soul
I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health
Caught Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome when I was ten years old
Internal and external fever, 80%
Fatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit
Severe pink eye, my eyes swollen shut
For like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck
Oh, and I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than its original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check
The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'm alright
My first years of Junior High School were not alright
Them dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod
I mean not even you, we eventually got cool
But I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school
Or the world to me, not saying that 'cause I'm your dude
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed to
Ironic we always had the same classes
I copied off your work, and you ain't always had
The right answers but it worked, mama, thanks a lot
Probably wouldn't have even graduated had you not
Somewhere down the line, we became an item
The love was in the air like this flight I'm lighting
The first few years was so exciting
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
My money got funny, you wanted to go on dates
I had a Sounwave beat tape tryna beat Drake
Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it
For me and you, you sing too so you knew the business
I know it was hard but you stayed down
My fam had doubts, you told me you was proud
I did some things, you did some things, always came back together
We knew the only way to make it work was work together
Seven whole years, seven whole years
It was supposed to end with our grand kids
Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short
I'm such a nice guy, why, Lord?
Why Lori? Why'd you have to take her from me?
I guess He needed your angel face for all of heaven to see
Your picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary
I swear, I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now I'm so doped up, I think I'm flyin'
I hope the spliff'll never finish
I guess the Mayans wasn't lyin'
2012, my world ended
You used to say that I could see the future
You was wrong, 'cause you was in it
And I was just with you the day before
You said you loved me, I said I loved you more
And as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu
And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you
I gotta stay 'cause I remember that day
I looked you in the face and told you
"Nothing can stop me, not even you"
Stick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme
Signed, sincerely yours, I live to let you...

Dot-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Everything I love the most gets taken away
My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Kurt Cobain
I still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke
Unless we talkin' symbolically, then I might agree
But if you really wanna look at it that way
Then, hey, man, God don't like me
I refuse to believe that, but what's acceptable
Is anything's possible, but nobody's special
My ma took my TV, Clem took my radio
Now I'm on TV and on the radio
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul

[Outro]
(Soul!)
