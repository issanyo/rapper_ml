[Hook 1]
The pain is gone!

[Hook 2: Ab-Soul]
Nah that bitch never leave
Got me waking up in cold sweats, yo I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates but my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
A minute ago, I was riding bicycle
And I can buy a Now & Laters with 5 nickels
When it was washing dishes and homework, cable and bullshit
I hit the block and never left
It was exciting watching life bring light to what I'm writing about like
A lamp in a cave, while I'm trapped in this maze
But Frankie Beverly wouldn't walk in my all-stars for a day
I watched kids play and think ignorance is bliss
Then I watched Kid-N-Play on House Party
And wish I was them
See you could say I'm brainwashed
Cause I came from an era where niggas don't care about nothing
And you're judged by how much your J's cost
But me being the rebel I am, I never gave a damn
Leave it to Beaver and the rest of you suckas
I'm complex like the magazine say I'm abstract
Like a trigonometry quiz and science lab rats
If I wasn't I, you could see the pain in my eyes
I watched brothers kill brothers over system of legal tender
Deteriorating my loins with liquor looking for joy
I put my soul on a platter, enjoy
I do this for the regular people who out the in crowd
Make it popular to be unpopular
Cause if we all came together, ain't no stopping us
And it hurts me so, to think how they divided us like an island in the road
Just in control if you ain't know and yo
Lock my body can't trap my mind
I got two decades of experience on my resume
Say I don't qualify and I'll call you a lie
I'm on a whole 'nother plateau, you still trynna be fly
And that goes for the narrow-minded whose ancestor was the pharaoh
He went from number 1 to zero
Let's take it back

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Punch]
Nah she still on me
She stalking my innermost thoughts, I guess she want me
Cause her primary fear is to die lonely
I got no disdain for Ms. Pain
She leave me love letters sealed with a kiss
Lipstick stains on the mirror
She help me see things a little clearer
Couldn't experience joy if she wasn't near us
I remember throwing shots back 'til I collapsed
Waking up hung over in a effort to give her the cold shoulder
It never worked
As soon as I sobered up, I couldn't avoid her tender touch
Like when Hezekaia died, couldn't look his momma in the eyes
Feeling I contributed to his demise
Guilt stricken, heart victimized
Postpartum Syndrome, blacking out
She wishing it was me, she cried
Each tear was like a symphony orchestra
Beethoven over the organs, a snag of tremendous proportions
Take this recording as the truth distorted
Through the eyes of a man who reaped the fruits of her courtship
And no fortune could ever overturn the misfortunes I absorbed in
The pain made me impure like foreskin, more that I can bargain
For, still I love her forever more

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
And even when I die, she gon' follow my kids
Soul brother, Ab-Soul
DJ Davis
Where'd that name come from?
Ab-Soul, it derives from absolute-ly of course
Absolutely
It's genuine, Precise was my first, one of my first names
Changed that cause of copyright issues
Then it became Absolute, changed that cause of copyright issues
Then it became Ab-Soulute, changed that cause of copyright issues
Ab-Soul just stuck, it's just been workin' for me
It's soulful, like, this type of music you're doing is soul, hip-hop soul
Is it in that sense or what?
Hey, funny story, like Soul, I added the soul because my sister was doing this production
The Dream Girls, right, and I seen Jimmy Hurley
Jimmy Hurley?
Jimmy Hurley in the part when he be like
"Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soulll!"
