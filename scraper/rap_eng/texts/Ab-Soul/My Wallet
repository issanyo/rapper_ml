[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Reach in my pocket and pull out my new wallet
I just got a Louis Vuitton
It's too poppin
But too often people will judge it's too awkward
But I don't give a flying fuck
I'm too ostrich
I walk inside of Saks like "Waddup bitch?"
I'm boutta fuck this cash up
And turn the 5th to a 6th
On my left is a chick
I think she wanting the dick
Probably because she seen the wallet that I speak of is thick
Like do she want me
She seen the Louie V and now she on me
But she don't know that I ain't got a job, they call me Tommy
In fact I borrowed this wallet from Clay, this shit is not me
As soon as she noticed that I was broke she didn't call me

[Hook: Jay IDK]
My wallet
My wallet
My wallet
Your wallet
My wallet
My wallet
My wallet
Your wallet
My wallet
My wallet

Your wallet
My wallet got these bitches and these niggas going crazy
Wallet got my family and my friends actin' lazy
Wallet got the thugs sayin' fuck you pay me

[Verse 2: Jimi Tents]
Reach in my pocket and pull out a gang of ones
Throw 'em on a stripper and dry hump her lady lumps
Got rain and thunder, her ass ain't clappin', don't save her number
My wallet empty so my bae won't let me graze her bumper
I got a sign that say "I need some money"
If they say no I say "God bless you" and whisper "That's why yo baby's ugly"
My wallet cost five hundred
It's filled with seven ones and a dusty condom I got from robbin' my brother's pockets
Shoutout to Chinese lady for shavin' dollars off the cost of laundry
I brought her thing, she want me
I gotta say the older the berry the sweeter the juice
She probably sweeter than swedish fish cause she like 92 with the juicy fruit
My wallet
My wallet
Your wallet
In need of a plug who out here sellin' off the sockets
Don't play with me, broke all day, dealers makin' plays
I might do the same on the corner sellin' lemonade
For my-

[Hook]
Wallet got my family and my friends actin' lazy
Wallet got the thugs sayin'

[Verse 3: Saba]
Fuck you pay me, I'm off the AC
It's hot in my room and cartoons cartoonin'
I'm wearin' a watch, the minute hand broke
But it go stupid with this outfit I just thrifted
But I make this shit look new and I put on my cousins shoes
I'm on my way to the greenline and I'm runnin' behind
The bus just left although I ran and make it in the time
Alloted a lot of niggas fake the lotto and ain't win
The pocket of the city that I'm from preaches patience
I walk to the train then like fuck it I'm late anyway
Fuck it I'm just goin' to school, it's not like I'm gettin' paid
My diploma put on hold, on the train with my earphones
Some niggas say "Run them pockets"
I ain't even got shit though

[Verse 4: Michael Christmas]
Look, I don't give a fuck Louis Vuitton or Clays
If it's comin' out ya pocket then boy it belongs to Jay
You better know what's at stake
I ain't really into beef but I'm down to run your pockets if I know I got to eat
Michael Christmas wallet is on my wish list
7 dollars, a condom, I save that for the bitches
Money is the motive, I'm just being specific
Thought I was hella passive, you rappers on my get-list
So gimme that, that's-
