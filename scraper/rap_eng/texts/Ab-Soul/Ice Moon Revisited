[Verse 1]
I would die, and say
I been wasting, all of my life
On this, moment
Like we, go all day
Fly away, you go and I
For it
I'd rather be with you tonight
I'm tired of the truth, just lie to me
I wanna run away!
I wanna go home!

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Verse 2]
I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Who's wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

[Chrous]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Put the herb in the air, take control of your life
Get them leeches out your ear, nothin' but leaders over here
We ain't drinkin sprite
I can quench your thirst, I can dim the lights
You can cum first, shit you can cum twice
Long as you coming baby, you ain't gotta hide
You ain't gotta lie
We can lay together, No more lonely Septembers
Cold and stormy weather, I know you remember
And whether or not we decide to tie a knot or not
I rather had than had not
Don't be afraid

[Chrous]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

[Outro (x3)]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
