[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
I am Alice
I'm in Wonderland
Where's the rabbit?
He is late again
Goodness gracious
I can't wait for him
Who has got the time?
Round and round and
Round and round we go
It's just like the
Same scenario
Good for nothing
Feels like somethin' ain't right

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I might
I might've got way too high

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I am trippin'
I keep slippin'
I cannot recognize
What's the difference
In pretending and
Living a real lie?
Ha ha ha ha ha
Everything is spinnin now
Ha ha ha ha ha
Have you seen the ground

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I might
I might've got way too high

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
(Break it down, roll it up)
Mountains and valleys, seashells from Sally
Ego removed but still in tune exactly
Pride set aside, third eye winking at me
My what a ride, real trippy shit
I glimpse with a squint but I can see a whole grip
My retinas red, my vision is crystal
Didn't use pencil but it's true I led
My way to this sedated state of mind I always tread
My daddy did it this is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man
I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams
So I take a deep breath, Puff, puff, pass
Pardon my paranoia, I'm just a product of my past
I show you how to let your soul sail
Sparking lala, talking to Allah
(Might of got way too high)

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I might
I might've got way too high
