I came up with this staring at a beautiful bitch
Nice ass, nice tits, nice legs, nice hips, wish
I could take you home and strip you butt naked then
Put you in a cage and feed you grapes all day long
I'm a dreamer, please forgive me baby, I'm just so determin-ated
To get you to demonstrate what you do with the men you dated
Pin me against the wall and give your all
I'll never point no fingers (I ain't got no gavel)
And since you been good
I slipped a present in that drink you drinking
And since you been good
I slipped a present in that drink you drinking
And since you been good
I slipped a present in that drink you drinking

You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Ain't no coming back, you're gone

Herbert the pervert, all three eyes up her skirt
I won't stop 'til I got it, w-won't stop 'til I get it
Persistence is the key, real shit she gon' remember me
And she got straight A's in grade school, she'll take the D
I need that, make it easy like A-B-C
I ain't into playing games, don't own a Wii or Playstation 3
Don't be shy, make it nasty, I won't mind, I like it nasty
My flow is nasty, my dough is nasty, I'll put my tongue there if you ask me
Politely, you feisty? I like feisty
I like good girls, I like bad girls, I like ratchets, I like wifeys
I like virgins, I like mamis so let's get more acquainted
And since you been good
I slipped a present in that drink you drinking
And since you been good
I slipped a present in that drink you drinking
No, you ain't never coming home

[JMSN]
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Ain't no coming back, you're gone
