[Hook: Ab-Soul]
One time for my niggas poured up yup, match a line
Get screwed up like the neck on Frankenstein
Purple weed, purple drank, purple swag, purple tag
We be getting throwed, we be, we be getting throwed

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Just copped a pack of Backwoods, I'm sitting high as hell
This OG kush suits this Honey Berry well
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a fo, that's right I'm tryna get throwed
Hit my nigga Agent, heard he bought an 8
My nigga Legend blessed me with a cup the other day
Hit my nigga Carver D, Dough Boy and YayCracc
Tell him it's a poe party, ASAP
Bumping out the speakers, coffee cups with lids
This way nobody accidentally ashing in my shit
Got a few two liters and it's 'bout to go down
Phenergan is the prescription of choice, just call us the Phenergan boys

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a fo', who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a fo', who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
One time for my niggas poured up, yup, match a line
Get screwed up like the neck on Frankenstein
Purple weed, purple drank, purple swag, purple tag
We be getting throwed, we be getting throwed

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I got this funny little dream of buying out the bar
Then flexing in my section like a fucking star
They ask me what I like to drink and I say I'm alright
Then all you see is my purple sprite, glistening off of the strobe light
No jolly ranchers please, this Ac' is all I need
I hope it ain't clich√© to shoot Pimp C a RIP
As well as DJ Screw since I made up this tune about lean
But as of late, all I see is poe like Section 8
The homie say he's got a few teens
That's three 16's and a whole lot of cream
I crack a seal, then drop a deuce, now I got mixed emotions
From here on out, it's slow motion

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a fo', who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a fo', who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know

[Outro: Ab-Soul & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Coming down, still sipping
Draped up dripped out, still sipping
Coming down, still sipping
Draped up dripped out, still sipping
I love the po', more than you'll know (I love, I love, I love)
Gotta let it show, I love the po', hey, yeah (I love the po')
