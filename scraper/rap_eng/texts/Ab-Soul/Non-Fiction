[Intro: Raheem DeVaughn]
Yo, 9th Wonder, we got one
Never, never done (Rapsody)
And Radio Raheem DeVaughn
Church on the move

[Verse 1: Raheem DeVaughn]
My birthplace was the Bronx
Adidas with the fat shoelaces
Cazelles on the frames of our faces
Boom Bap, out the boom box
We've been building this 40 years strong
The game is for the taking this is history in the making
And let me make it clear (Ooh la la laa)
This ain't no bubble gum rap with 9th on the track
And Rapsody (Ooh la la laa)

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
This is, this is (Hip Hop)
This is (Ooh la la laa)
The Real (x4)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
I stay on my Ps and my Qs - Ss, Ts, Us
I'm always working, how you spell success in the stu
Some get they money, like to blaze in the coupe
Was raised to spend days practicing like the hoops
We the truth, none realer, too uncommon like Dilla, The Light
I shine, my rhymes come paired like the Williams
Two 22's, I'm a sister worth millions, lyrically
They all fear the flow like Big Williams
Polo dipped, loco whips
Weren't impressed if the flows won't potato crisp
Rap back like the NATO, connect with gods
Cause my odds of being large weighed out like Chris
Yo, Biggie the goal, I'm really the mold
Of what you really want to be if you hadn't of sold
Your soul, I burn slow like fo'-fo's hitting
'95 spirit, in the days it was written
Cats stay trippin', but rip and I never stop
Got a little buzz now I bubble like a kettle pot
I know the devil watch and wanna touch me
But like metal box, I stay locked under this Hip Hop forever God
Reckless, necklace, flows all hang 'em
Real coming back, now these rappers all changing
Fearful careers, I don't cower, the new power
Duracell it never runs out for an hour
Keep destroying, smoke 'em like sour
Break 'em all down to rebuild 'em like towers
That's the Real

[Raheem DeVaughn]
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)
This is this is, hip hop
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)
This is this is, hip hop
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
The modern day saints of our stories
New torch bearers, we the children like Corey
Gunz of the ones that ran Nation of Millions and watched Mike in Delores
Used to ride to Nore, now the people inquiry
About the 5’3” emcee with ovaries
Got a bite on the mic like the likes of ol’ Lauryn
Hip-hop, score gotta settle it's the flip flop
Back to when cats rolled Lexus like wrist watch
Elbow out the door, bumpin' Nas 'til the speaks pop
Couldn't see me eye to eye, keep pumpin' your Reeboks
Rattle rear views, clear view, I don't fear you or you
You keep an ear to the streets, too, to hear true I been in the booth, yea killin' on the daily
Jamla representer another baby of the 80’s
Katy Perry, I grew up on Mary
The flow varies cause I studied those old from the erry
Of the gold, why I shine like that find it scary
The game over, I kill wack emcees, all buried
It's the real

[Break: Raheem DeVaughn]
The game is for the taking this is history in the making
Let me make it clear (Ooh la la laa)
This ain't no bubble gum rap with 9th on the track
TDE, ladies and gentlemen Ab-Soul!

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
And while you niggas keep bangin' the same drum
I'm smokin' like I ain't got the same lungs
I had when I started, pardon my ignorant rants
I rap like I move keys but Apple S can't save 'em
There's only so much you can show 'em
They been reading his story so long, they think they know him
I'm sewing up the game, I need needle and thread
Some people lead sheep
Some people just need wool, the shit cuts deep
Rugby toughin' the feel, you be where the rugs be
In the house nigga, with the rest of the house niggas
Thug life, rolling, my homies are screaming "fuck life"
Showin' love at the same damn time
I'd say the future is looking bright contrary to CNN
Give me a mic and about three nights
I turn straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Man I made a man cry vibing to Be A Man
Walking like an Egyptian, life ain't fair oh
Boy just got shipped and the judge don't care
I'll take my steak rare, maybe it will help me bare
With all the bloody consequences obvious in this here
So I guess I got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til it's gone
Til' every terrain on this plane experience sunshine
Two fingers up and fuck one time

[Outro]
So allow yourself to get caught up in the Rapsody
And the 9th Wonder of the world actually
Raheem DeVaughn
Soul!
