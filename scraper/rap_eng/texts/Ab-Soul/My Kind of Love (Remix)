[Verse 1]
I can’t buy your love, don’t even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won’t make you happy, still I’m not gonna lie
But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you
I know I’m far from perfect, nothin’ like your entourage
I can’t grant you any wishes, I won’t promise you the stars
But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you

[Chorus – part 1]
Cause when you’ve given up
When no matter what you do is never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That’s when you feel my kind of love

[Chorus - part 2]
And when you’re crying out
When you fall and then can’t pick your heavy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven’t stuck around
That’s when you feel my kind of love

[Verse 2]
You won’t see me at the parties, I guess I’m just no fun
I won’t be turning up the radio singing, “Baby You’re The One.”
But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you
I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what I don’t mean
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve
But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you

[Chorus – part 1]

[Chorus - part 2]

I got you uh
Ab-Soul, yea

[Verse: Ab-Soul]
You could lie to me, you could steal from me
I’d still ride for you, I’d still die for you
Even if you forget and everything you leave behind
I never lied, I love you in a place where there’s no space and time
I mean what I say, I say what I mean
My heart’s on my sleeves, I threw all my tank tops away
And if it’s meant to be you will feel the intensity
She said she’d rather twerk than turn the other cheek
The key is to discern the pure from the tainted
My heart beats only for you, I’m not playing, it’s true
I may look like a fool to you but soon you’ll understand
The power in God’s plan
You’re treading on troubled waters, well I was once told when it
Feels like hell then
Heaven’s around corner, the weather is fair
But tomorrow will bring rain
So when you cryin out and nobody's around, I’ll be there
Don’t question that yea

[Bridge]
My heart beats only for you
My heart beats only for you
My heart beats only for you yea
My heart beats only for you yea yea

So don’t ever question

(Chorus – part 1)
