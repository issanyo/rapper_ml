[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]

Straight out of Carson, Asshole, Ab-Soul
Broke in probably '05 like my graduation tassel
Everybody treat me like I wake up in a castle
The little engine that could
More horsepower than a saddle
And why would I battle
When these other niggas infants with the penmanship
Shit, that ain't a mic, that's a rattle
As soon as you remove your bib we can get it in
Stand up nigga, even when I'm sittin' in
Pull your pants up nigga, getting too big for your britches
You fucking with a dude that did it with no digits
Just dope written, you're spoiling the art
Like a kid with no siblings, uh
And I'm still the most pure
Even having unprotected sex with a coach whore
Hip-hop till my heartbeat cease
I ain't a cash cow, but I do eat beef
Movin' in the right direction, map quest the cross streets
If you cross reference all of my efforts with perfection
You'll see I pole vaulted like an election
Over the bar ya'll raised, or the standard ya'll set
Never with the extras, on or off set
It's a rap, not a lecture, you ain't gotta pay attention
But I'm a music soul child, please just listen
And my mother ain't the virgin Mary
But I'm so religious with the lyrics I'm a Christian
On the verge of crucifixion, Non dash fiction
You lower class livin' with your poor performance
You're bringing the house down, fuck a mortgage
Fuck a chain, I'm a free man, first name Morgan
And when I die I'mma donate organs
Show 'em how it look to be this live on the inside man
And know I had it mapped out like the inside man
I ain't robbing no banks I'm just real strategic
Greedy as a motherfucking glutton
Both hands in the pot like I'm paraplegic
I take pride in knowing no one is remotely close
Soul brotha number two, even a dead druggie ain't overdose
Get a clue like blue
Cause even niggas with the flu ain't in the stu like dude, uh

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]

And I'm still on my shit
Just like Elvis I'mma die on my shit
I'm holding my pelvis writing this shit
Middle fingers up to those who oppose
Like when niggas started wearing skater clothes
I kept a fresh pair of vans, but who didn't
And in my city I'm the man, but who isn't
It's the untold story of the unknown glory from the unknown city
Don't show me no pity
Ab-Soul, Carson, we gets busy
Really I'm from Del Amo!
Who's with me?
(Soul!)
