[Part I: Produced by Curtiss King]

[Intro: Audra the Rapper + Ab-Soul]
Quiero vivir como los árboles
Breathe easy!
Trees, trees, trees
Soul!
I just wanna—I just wanna—
LT3 shit, nigga, look

[Verse 1]
I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But I'm about to go on tour
Can't wait for wind, pollination to plant my seeds in the soil
Around '07 TDE struck oil
It's my turn, Mr. LongTerm of turmoil
I'm holdin' up the terminal takin' flicks
I'm irritated but they're the reason that I'm gettin' rich
Cheese, give me an upgrade, see
Then I'll be on my way, I'm on my way to NYC
Last time I was there I swear I sold out SOBs
In Times Square with my circle of G's, you nah mean?
You shoulda never gave us niggas money
We comin' for everything, you nah mean?
Fuck you niggas with your hands out
Suck my third leg while I branch out

[Hook]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Shit don't grow on trees, breathe easy!

[Verse 2]
I got most of you mothafuckas stumped
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Lord forgive me but my pennies turnin' into dubs
I'm losin' my sense, they say I changed up
And I don't feel no different, I'm still the same nigga
Maybe my brain's bigger, gettin' brains quicker
Used to cop a little deuce
Now I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite stock a boost
Ab-Soul, yeah I'm gettin' loot
Bitches walkin' bow legged out my dressin' room
Was at the Travelodge but now we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
And my backpack more OG than your hood, dang
Hey, can't live without the Benjamins
But I'm interested in photosynthesis

[Hook]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Shit don't grow on trees, breathe easy!

[Bridge]
Me and she sittin' in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Fuck that! I'm just tryna get up in your panties
Where the trees, trees, trees
Where the trees, trees, trees, trees
Burn the mothafuckin' trees, trees, trees, trees
With the trees, trees, trees, trees

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
It's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Nigga it's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team

[Break: Ab-Soul]
Heaven ain't far Curtiss, it ain't far at all my nigga

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Check, Joey I know I told you, quote it in a verse
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
Wha gwan Jah no rassclat me
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Rarely do I bark, hope you get the analogy
Top Dog embarkin' on the whole industry
Niggas get to bitin', I be like breathe easy!
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I'm Canibus smokin' cannabis, sippin' Actavis
Before the Mathers diss I used to work at Magic Disk
With a dollar and a dream, why you think money is green?
Color of vegetation, the most important thing
Trees

[Outro]
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some

[Part II: Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Intro:]
Ayo, Dahi, what' up, my nigga? Drop that shit!

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Uh, I feel like I'm finished Soul searching
I feel like I know my sole purpose
Colder than a Winter Solstice
You're a dope dealer if you sold this
Yo, Soul everywhere if you ain't notice! (YEAH!)
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't console (YEAH!)
Known to consolidate hope into those listenin'
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm solicitin'! (YEAH!)
Soul Plane, Soul Train, those are no-brainers
Soul so thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day and a half, in these 8 and a halves
I solidify why I’m the greatest to rap (Soulo!)
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo (YEAH!)
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go? Soul gon' shine
Everybody knows like Beyonce and Solange!
Uh, what the fuck is Soul on?
We really out here but we ain't at the Salon
Look, a pair of Persols that cost like fo'
Kid from Del Amo, with a flow that's so universal... Soul!

[Outro]
Oh-oh yeah and I'm the soul-lution nigga!
Soul-lute me!
That was a stretch...
I'm Ab-Soul-lutely the best
Yeah!
