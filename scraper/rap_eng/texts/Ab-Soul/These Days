[Hook: O'My's]
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
(Swear to God this the only time Iâ€™ve used this flow)
I'm more than man, I died and I rose again
I left these holes in my hand just so you know who I am
An alien, extraterrestrial, ET's a mini me, you understand?
Look what I did, smoke like a chimney
Then add to that, that I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70's
So many styles I write with a ghost
Like I had assistance, but this is just dope, dope
Bottles of Belaire, the prince is the freshest
Tree by the elbo we get for the LO
So I should be happy, but this shit is stressin'
Staring at heaven like ''fuck is perfection?''
I'm popping downers to deal with depression
Cause when you the plug here come the finessing, finessing
Smoking dope with the hitters
Don't know no new niggas and business is business
Can I get a motherfucking witness?

[Hook: O'My's]
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
