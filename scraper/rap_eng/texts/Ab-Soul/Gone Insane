[Verse 1]
I feel like, I'm affiliated with the illuminati, bitch
All seeing fucking eye, this is your enlightenment
I'm lighting this, fire my supplier always like to give
Higher than I've ever been these heights are mighty frightening
Your hands up as if you wanna strike like lightening
Don't shoot, you can't fight a viking on Vicodin
Can you? Hmm, I would like to see you try it then
I be eating rappers, that's the only way I'm biting 'em
That was yummy yummy, dummy dummy, nothing's funny funny
Give a bitch a sippy sippy, then I get some sucky sucky
Sucky sucky now, think the nigga must be lucky lucky
She's such a doll, I guess that makes me Chucky
What's up with y'all other than nothing at all?
Bitches licking my balls, you ain't nuttin' at all!
You ain't nuttin' at all, neither am I
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!

[Bridge]
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick, pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill (Fly nigga, fly nigga)
Party every single night, mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone (Die nigga, die nigga)

[Verse 2]
Life's a bitch, but she won't let me hit
So I just masturbate to her naked flicks
I ain't got change for a dolla, but I think I'm making sense
I do resemble my father, but do I really know I'm his?
Sometimes I like to go on a tangent of random shit
Stay with her Black and Mild out and a handful of ass and tits
Skywalker in the blunt, Darth Vader in the cup
You don't get lifted with us, your elevators stuck
I never gave a fuck, my name never came up
But now that I done came up, I think I'm King Tut
I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government
He probably think I'm sniffing cocaine and some other shit
I'm on some other shit, Black Hippy, ho!
Yippy ka yeee, Yippy ka yoo
Tilt ya head you see me in the sky
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!

[Verse 3]
Drowning in Moscato, popular pothead
Feel like I hit the lotto, and I just got head
From a famous model (Who?) Gloria Velez
Lusting for Cubana's culo you know what it is
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, experience my fate
All I'm missing is a band of gypsies and some purple haze
But now it's O.G. Kush and Ayiro instrumentals
No need to insinuate, miss me with the innuendo
Ya outlooks lousy someone needs a new window
I'mma win I just don't know when though, you bimbos know
What you in for some info to make you exercise your mental
A seed small as my pinkie can be your weeping willow
I'm so ill, I'm held hostage at a hospital
Doing it big like not little
Tivo the revolution when it's televised
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!
