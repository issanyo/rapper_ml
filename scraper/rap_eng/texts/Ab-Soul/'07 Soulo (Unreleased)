[Verse: Ab-Soul]
If your word is bond your bars are harder than my last bar
All that other shit is feble we're people get jacked for it
Don't make your face another bulletin on the wanted tack board
Crash court DA call the task force
We off the 91 freeway this what you asked for
Fast forward, we in Cahoots, with the rival troops
Fuck the rivalry, when you can get more loot
Like, fuck the ice if you could get more suit
Stick a swisher in my suit when I die and I'll be cool
Smoking cools outside of the school, no cruel
My niggas that graduated and I'll be out soon
Make sure my plan is saturated for the (video ends)
