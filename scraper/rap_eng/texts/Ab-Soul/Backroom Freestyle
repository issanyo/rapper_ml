[Ab-Soul]
Yo Ab-Soul, y’all know me
HiiiPoWeR, throw up that three
Pour up…that thing, f the consequences
Y’all mean, living reckless, doing the most
Wanna vote for the president but they be swaying those
Doper than what Jose bring on the boat
You all gassed up yo, faking the folk
TDE the amazing group
Victory is sweet, you can taste the fruit
Got the whole world saying Soulo
You made music that was made to mute
So I might raise the roof
Drive y’all crazy then change the route
Was hungry, watching Paid In Full
And that’s why now my plate is full
I’m eating but it’s moe I need, no really, it’s moe I need
Pop champagne like Rhyme Rouse, her back arch like eyebrows
Ain’t no taking my style, ain’t no taking my flow
Carson Californication, United States of Del Amo
Soul brother number two, you are under my control
I’m on the corner of Park and 106
And I just killed the backroom, don’t front, I’m that dude, Soulo
