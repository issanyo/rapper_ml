[Intro]
Try to relax, try to relax
Cause I know you're anxious, baby
I know you're anxious, for me
But you just gotta try to relax, try to relax, try to relax
I wrote the majority of this rap on a bean bag under the JMZ train tracks
The bro P on the motherfucking boards, homeboy
(And if you don't know, now ya know nigga)

[Chorus]
Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doin' what I want to
You know what I'm up to (git something, nigga, git something)
I hit the Bodega for the Backwoods
Pack of Dutches if you lucky nigga
Cups with the ice
Just doing just doing what I want to, you know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git something, nigga, git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to

[Verse 1]
I swear to God I wish I wrote this fucking verse on Mother's Day
That ain't got shit to do with this or does it? Fuck it, Anyway
I've been miseducated, mislead, misinterpreted
Misunderstood, mistaken, misjudged
That's why I'm a misfit, up to mischief
On a mission, in a missionary, hittin missionaries (missionary)
That was all misses, terms with 'mis' prefixes to be specific
All you feminists should be on my dick for this shit (word)
But listen close, this where shit get tricky
What all these words have in common is that they're all iffy
Hence misogyny, obviously
I'd switch the 'y' in 'mystery' with 'i' if I could (I would)
If you was Nuit you would know it nigga
But you're not so I guess y'all good
Uh, so one time for the women
Two times for the ladies, three times for the bitches
Uh, don't forget about the bitches
Adam's rib ain't adding up, this story must be more extensive
(YMF nigga) Meiosis, mitosis and some mo' shit
Noah had motion in the ocean before his boat did
And you know why, I love my mama so much
And I can't watch my lil' sister grow up, so I

[Chorus]
Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to (git something, nigga, git something)
I hit the Bodega for the Backwoods
Pack of Dutches if you lucky nigga (cross your fingers)
Cups with the ice
Just doing what I want to, you know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git something, nigga, git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git something, nigga, git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git something, nigga, git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to
(You gotta git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to

[Outro]
I, Soulo, still a member in good standing of the He-Man woman haters club. Do solemnly swear to be a He-Man and hate women and not play with them or talk to them unless I have to, and especially, never fall in love, and if I do may I die slowfully and painfully and suffer for hours, or until I scream bloody murder
