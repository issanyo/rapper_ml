As far back as I recall
I was liking it all
Nah I wasn't liking it all
It was love
We talked on a regular basis
She was so amazing
I had to move into dating so I dropped my girl and hopped on it
Got caught in, the mix
I know it felt awkward as shit
When will she offer the kiss
She showed me that she was my soul mate
This shit felt so great
But a week later, she had to settle her ends
She hit me up on the phone, told me we'd prolly be better as friends
All like she was kinda scared
Id leave her and that the idea made her feel kind of weird
And right there I was lead to discover
I ended up with a best friend instead of a lover
And man not to boast
But that's her loss; though I gotta suppose I let her by cause I got too close man
