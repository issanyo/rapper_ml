[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I got 700 dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So, baby, won't you fall on through?

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
It's been a little while
Since the last time I saw you
What's up with you and old dude?
I hope everything is all cool

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Can you feel what I feel
When I feel what I feel?
Empathy, empathy

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Lady, if you would just give me the time
You could leave all of your problems behind
You got a past, but that's in the past
And we all know that, you can't press rewind
I understand, we're all human
I'll lend you a hand, if you wouldn't mind
Pamper you, and stand for you
The man to make everything right

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul + Javonte]
I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
But baby, don't stress it
I hope you learned a lesson

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
I tell you, I've been down that road before
If anyone can feel you, it is me
So won't you let you garments hit the floor
And let me let you feel me

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Javonte]
Lights please, lights please
Light-skinned, mighty fiesty
Ojo, I see, I see
You like me too

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Can you feel what I feel
When I feel what I feel?
