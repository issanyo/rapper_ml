[Intro: Snake Hollywood/Ab-Soul]
Snake Holly, Ab-Soulo-Ho They know, smokin reggie-they ain't ready for dat million dolla flow, they gone choke!

[SOOUULL]

[Hook: Snake Hollywood & Ab-Soul]
Just another day rolling through the hood
Ridin round up to no good-- (Ab-Soul) tell these niggas hollywood
You can ride to it, you can smoke
You can puff pass til ya, til ya choke, til ya, til ya, til ya choke

[Verse 1: Snake Hollywood]
Burnin' Jays of that dour bud nigga
Turtle wax, triple polish-Cowabunga nigga
No amount of words could define this hunger my nigga
When a nigga's famished he could eat the glue off a stamp-BUT I CANT
Im God... dont compare to them others
Cause they dont bang (ungh) word to the mother
If you ain't slangin that killer or that OG Kush
Dont approach me like you know me, Im OD Stush?
Boss individual, Hoff givin you
Swag on a kilogram through them blog interviews
Brooklyn raised me, taught me how to swerve
& taught me how to break a zigzag down wit the herb word
My fingertips anointed, roll batches of white widow
No ordinary Boss, strawberry cough cigarillo
Know my accomplishments, Hoes wanna follow him
Milk me for my doe but im lactose intolerant
I get a leg up on these bitches like an ottoman
Who real? You ain't
Way before the butane flow wit the blue flame
When I was ridin round spazzin, snatching rings and chains on the Q-train

[Hook: Snake Hollywood & Ab-Soul]
Just another day rolling through the hood
Ridin round up to no good-- (Ab-Soul) tell these niggas hollywood
You can ride to it, you can smoke
You can puff pass til ya, til ya choke, til ya, til ya, til ya choke

[Verse 2: Snake Hollywood & Ab-Soul]
(Snake) Me and Broke is a oxymoron
Finna get my Pac Shakur on, Lord Knows
20 Million dollar ambition im driven
A champagne wish and a caviar dream lets get it
Flooded rocks, black diamonds when the summer drops
Charging these niggas like im Juggernaut
Hard to be real when you ain't from the block
We smoking blue straight off the boat
You can taste the paddle & canoe in every toke (cough?)

(Ab-Soul) Im in a rover, me and doe we rollin heavy smoke
And you know we got that loud like a heavy note
Backwood boxes devoured in a couple hours
And the homie laced me wit an ounce of the sour
You get the money & the power then you earn the respect or
End up in a Urn I guess my actions is affirmative (soul)
Pass the herb to blacklippastor herb Im high as hell hell
Thats a classic contradiction
Dont mind me im ganja twistin

[Hook: Snake Hollywood & Ab-Soul]
Just another day rolling through the hood
Ridin round up to no good-- (Ab-Soul) tell these niggas hollywood
You can ride to it, you can smoke
You can puff pass til ya, til ya choke, til ya, til ya, til ya choke
Just another day rolling through the hood
Ridin round up to no good-- (Snake Hollywood) tell these niggas Ab-Soul
Snake Holly, Ab-Soulo-Ho They know, smokin reggie-they ain't ready for dat million dolla flow, they gone choke!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It ain't a myth my lungs black as my lips
In different area codes, running through zips (ungh)
Back to back, dabs of wax
Had batches of hash before you hashed ya tag-you mad
I had the game in the bag like a point 6
Like the d-boys showin love on the dimes of that piff (I'm)
Somewhere gettin high in my downtime
Makin space jams, I slam dunk when I rhyme
You choking off that reginald, that ain't acceptable
Professional puffers nigga, no swishers or dutches nigga
OG 28 percent THC, flew into JFK, I know you smell me
Hollywood Snake Holly, we high as we can be
Im smokin that Tahoe, you rollin that Camry....
(Snake Hollywood interrupts) ayo Solo... lemme borrow them shades for a minute my nigga. I'mma give em right back to you...

[Verse 4: Snake Hollywood]
I'mma KDot Killa, Herbert Stevens the senior
Snake Holly and my Son Soulo on the reup
Been a minute since you Compton niggas stomped into war
Little Rock Arkansas took yall title in 94
& this nigga Kendrick, he dont want that drama wit New York niggas that'll chop ya body up, feed u to Rottweilers & pits
No evidence (nah), ain't no forensices for that cold case
Hop up out the swimming pool, tell me how the ocean taste
The beast from the east, I'mma a monster I body ya roster-devour ya squadron, fuck Sherane put my cock on her tonsils
Talkin bout king of new york, nigga im Christopher Walken
Laurence fishburne wit the nots at the chicken spot
Lickin shots from Audis, Bugattis, Maserati drops
Ask ya man Solo... he know...
He could tell you clear as day that my lyricism is fury ?
& given my past is a problem if I'm on yo ass
The boogeyman standin right in ur livin room, screamin out harsh obscenities-twisted off shots of Hennessy
Cause you dont understand him that dont mean that he nice
It just means u corny as fuck when you speak into mics
Im from the home of the great Daddy Kane & Rakim
Pac, Nas, Notorious Big, the Lox & them
Jaz-O, Jay-Z, Pun & Joe Crack Papi
Jeru The Damnja & the Mash Out Posse (Ahki)
How can we compromise, niggas tellin lies
The revolution of Snake Holly will not be televised
This is not a cheap shot or publicity stunt, this that heat rock
The opportunity to give you niggas what you want
I got my money right, my bars is up, regardless of what you fuck niggas is talkin bruh, my shit hard as a Tonka Truck
Conqueror, conquistador
Bodies fallin all over Slauson, they dying before they reach the floor
I dare you respond, this Napalm bomb, I transform to a Goblin?, like Im Rae Dawn Chong
You a good kid in a mad city, I'mma gully youte
Thats why you fucking fools is scared to interact wit me
Inhale that Sensi Mina, that Platinum Kush burnin slow
I got you shook cause Im aimin for ya dome
I dethrone priests, prophets & kings, my posse fixing to swarm
Come see defeat, through the optical lense of the Don

I'mma Kdot Killa, Jay-Rock die too, looking out for SchoolBoy Q when I find you... weak muthafukkas dont deserve to breath, Snake Holly-AbSoulo on the flow, yo these niggas gonna choke!

[Ab-Soul] Snake Holly, Ab-Soulo-Ho They know, smokin reggie-they ain't ready for dat million dolla flow, they gone choke!
