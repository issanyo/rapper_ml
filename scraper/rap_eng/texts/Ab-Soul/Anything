[Verse 1]
You've been my man since I don't know when
When I was new to the hood, you broke me in, and I'll never forget
You never followed the reg, you'd rather follow your head
Even when I chose another route you held me down
Your house is the spot, your moms is the best
Took us to and from to the mall and the party on request
Never stayed low key, you was the loud type, do it now type
They shoot at us, we gotta shoot 'em down type, better believe in honesty
You found a wallet on the floor, yeah you kept the dollars
But took the rest to the lost and found, always considerate
That's why you'll always be my nigga, Chris
They call you Rocky but I call you Capital
You keep it real with me, not cause you want to, because you have to
Me and my boys gettin' money international
The guy I can always rely on
I would give you my right arm if you asked, coz on the real

[Hook]
I'll be your boy 'til I pass and go on, cause I would die in your honor
That's on my momma, I'd do anything for you
There ain't a task too large for my dogs, barefoot through the frost
I swear to God I'd do anything for you
You ever need it, make the call and I'm on it, mission accomplished
I promise, my word is bond, I'd do anything for you
When comes to shove I'm right there by your side, down for whatever
Whenever, cause on the real, I'd do anything for you

[Verse 2]
My best friend, you'll probably be my best man
Always overprotective of me, and out for my wellbeing
We wrote our first verses together
Who would of thought that we'd both be in this for cheddar
Remember when I hit you in your throat that time we was going ?
It felt good, don't tell nobody
Because you were always stronger
Wish we could go back to those junior highschool hallways longer
Me, you and Chris up to mischief
My nigga lying about, girls that we fucked back in the days
Laughing away, ?
Former john cuffs, ?, shift shirt
And your ? was whack, but you still came exact
When I heard your fathers car blown up
I swear to god that my heart froze up
?, Rest In Peace JT
I got your son, I'll make that pact with you
Till God send him back with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You changed my life really, ? my down to earth mommy
Open my eyes to so many things
To the table you had, plenty to bring
Taught me about hip-hop and it's flaws
The bottle popping and whores, don't really mean much
Corporate Americas in hysterics when they see us
The game really needs a clean up crew
Had me looking into history, dug deep in my soul til' I found my identity
The real me, your moms took me in, when moms put me out
Offered me change, thats out of love, or she's awfully strange
Wanted to be your man, man, you ain't see it happening
I got the message, got with Lori, now you stressing
Cause you worried that, imma leave you all alone
I never left, I'm calling you frantic, trying to salvage whatever's left
I hope we still good and you ain't just saying it, I pray to this
Split this joint in your play list and know that

[Hook]
