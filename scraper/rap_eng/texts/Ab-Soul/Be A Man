Lifestyles of the Broke and Almost Famous

[Verse 1]
"Herbert Anthony you need to get you life together"
That's my momma bothered by, how I'm living life like whatever
They say im pressed for time, but I don't press the issue
I just stay on my grind,chain smoking marijuan help me free my mind
What a coincidence, like feeling guilt stricken by your innocence
In a sense im livin in my second childhood
Dont pay a lick of rent, where I eat, sleep, and shit
And when you twenty-two that don't sound good
Maybe if I went to school it'll be cool
I've have something to fall back on if this rap don't crack
Perhaps i'd have a better story had I sold crack
Lets go back, to Carson high fluctuating my goals
Writing rhymes through the lecture knew I should've took notes, yo
Sometimes I think im running in place, chasing hopes
So is my name as Ab-Soul or is it average joe

[Hook] (x2)
All this commotion goes in one ear, out the other
I'm still gone make it, one way or the other

(quit acting like a kid herb, gone be a man
It's a man's world, how you suppose to feed your fam
You need to act more like an adult, pull up your pants
I know you do music but what's your plan B man)

[Verse 2]
If I knew when I was younger would I grew to know
I coulda tackle things more different, coulda been more defensive
Coulda been more responsible, coulda been more persistent
But I didn't and I ain't repenting
My parents wake up in the morning to a cup of coffee
Then go off to work. It kills'em when im still in bed snoring
Only if they knew, their young boy was in the stu
'til like 5 AM cookin up classics to make them
Proud as house niggas that could stay in
That was rather brash, but you can replace these scraps with straight cash
I told jay I'mma buy her a house one day
I'll probably send Katie and Kira off to college too
But right now I'm broke as a joke, I should do comedy
Dude, I need a job, somebody hire me fast
So I could win my girl over, she probably cheatin on my ass
You motherfuckers better try and snatch her while she up for grabs

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Ab-Soul talking)
Its like real difficult to articulate it
It's like you got your goals. You got your aspirations
Your dreams, and you chasing that, you pursuing that
But in-turn it cost for you to sacrifice alot of your availability to go out their and get this paper, nah mean?
Its hard to say you a man still and livin at your momma house..

Yo, I had a conversation with my step-pops
Basically inquiring the time frame when I'mma pop
I told'em I ain't know but I'm determined to blow
Not like a fluffer, more like plaques that's platinum and gold
Thats on my great-grandmother
He shook his head and said:
"I don't know much about the music industry but whats been said
The people ain't making no bread, lets be more realistic
How you gone take care of a wife? how you gone feed your children
Im on my knees everyday tryna provide for yall
I bought that car that you dippin, but you don't chip in
You shouldve went to UCLA, like your cousin Jay
He got a big signing bonus, every year like 80k"
I looked him in the face and said "It ain't about the money
And honestly, buying an education sounds funny
But have a little faith in your son, I'll come through for ya,"
He said be a man Herb, thats all I really want from ya
