[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Drugs and girls

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
Show me some love, my love
Last time I checked, you loved my love
Place nothing above my love
If you leave, come back, like above your butt
No ifs, ands, or buts
You're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up
(When loves runs high)
Just when you thought enough was enough
I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty
Ho, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind
I wanna touch up and down your spine
(When loves runs high)
A perfect 10 living on cloud 9

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)

(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now stop... and just groove.)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q + Jay Rock]
Uh, faded off life
See the dopeman, time to get right
Open up a bud light
Don Julio, coronas, comas
Bad bitches, bad bitches, call up bad bitches
Bring your friend to be a witness
(When loves runs high)
Whatever that mean
Need a shot, you the vaccine
You pumping through my veins
I'm a crack fiend, you're the crack
Drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur
Bend you over in a rover, it's over
Never sober my cup runneth over
(When loves runs high)
Better know, girl, you fuckin' with a soldier

[Hook]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)

(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now stop... and just groove.)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock + Ab-Soul]
Blunts and broads
Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God
Baby tryna grab my draws
They call me dozer, I knock down walls
Jose, that's my homie
Yeah I hear you callin' earl in the hallway
(When loves runs high)
I gotta come down just to party
I'm turnt up, maxed out
Willie Manchester, blow your back out
Baby girl my advice, better back out
Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house
Listen ma, I got a role you can act out
And then like prince pant's get your ass out
I don't need a princess, I need a mistress
Whose sticking dick in a damsel in distress

[Hook]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)

(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now everybody in the place!)
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now stop... and just groove.)

(When the love runs high
It's-)
