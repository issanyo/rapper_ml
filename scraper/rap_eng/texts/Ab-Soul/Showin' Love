[Intro]
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love

[Verse 1]
Pants still sagging to the floor
Sagging through your turf like I own this fucking earth
That's on my fucking life, I'm just living fucking life
This ain't House Party 5 but what's popping for tonight
I got a lil' more dough to spend
Let's rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smoking y'all joking
Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm toking
Bum house on Skid Row ain't this potent
Holy shit, I'm God-Scent, admire my stench
CÃ¡llate la boca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right
True achiever, new Adidas still tryna earn my stripes

[Hook: Ab-Soul (Kendrick Lamar)]
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)

[Verse 2]
It's easy to assume we doing decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
And you'd agree, as sure as one and two is three
You'd have this music down to a tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a key
It's only one in Ab-Soul, still open doors
Don't forget the dash, I might leave you with a gash
I ain't doing no more shows unless I'm getting cash
Phillies full of hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put Del Amo on the map nigga
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complaning
And everyday I'm raining got the most precipitation
Soulo, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, wear your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch, apply patience
And watch us pop across the population

[Hook: Ab-Soul (Kendrick Lamar)]
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)

[Verse 3]
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run this shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clowning when you see me styling
Joking, smiling, scoped your poker face through these black shades
(Smoking on hay) in the middle of the barn
At least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 & 38 (Great)

[Hook: Ab-Soul (Kendrick Lamar)]
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
(Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit)

[Verse 4]
Motherfuck the government, democrats, republicans
Can shove it up, where they take a shit, we in this bitch
In a sense, I'm militant with a trigger finger itch
Cause I'm always killing it, you see this shit in my cerebral I invent
It should be illegal, I admit, surrender quick
I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach
Eighth grade or you move weight like a gastric bypass
Get a good look at my ass before you kiss it, sons of bitches
Get well acquainted with it, we gon' be here for a minute
HiiiPower, pissing on the Declaration
Of Independence and you can bet my John Hancock the biggest
Fuck a proposition, 'less it's in my best, interest
Kissing ratchets in the mouth, lift her dress and show address
Don't be so upset, show some love when you see a thug
Getting pita bread, I put the nina to your head
You heard what I said
Soul
