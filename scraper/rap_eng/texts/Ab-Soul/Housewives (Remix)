[Intro: Ab-Soul]
I got it
I got it, it's lit, it's lit
Yeah

[Hook: Bas + Ab-Soul]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope from the quotes I never wrote
Tell em' me and my bro Doe Burger came for the dope only
Benjamin Franklin them folks owe me
Bassy told you my nigga, I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit, but ain't pay off all my tuition
Now I'm back in the town from rapping for crowds
A nigga been searching for purpose
And guess what I found?

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Pastor Black Lip join my diocese
Warn the people sleeping on the legion
I'm a Dreamvillain talking major keys
Think DJ Khaled playing Mavis Beacon
Soulo found the loud and lit it back woods
Back to back, it's like I'm mad at Meek
Burning brain cells with my nigga that just made bail like last week
Still ducking strays in the plies like submissive bitches
With my dogs at the top and we in heat, fuck all ya'll 'til I'm in the box
Six feet underneath the gravel, casket made of 47 karat gold
Hear the trumpets blow, Jesus banging the gavel
Soul

[Hook 2: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives

[Verse 2: Bas]
Soulo hold up let me get it back
Had to run the borough, bring the city back
Got the power in my head, yeah, yeah
Been a year since I fit in fitted caps
Go and tell them niggas that Bas brought the East back, eat that
Niggas play my album and repeat that
Niggas play your album, hear them weak raps
And delete that, that's soft shit
Need some wheatgrass
Better boss up, awh fuck
Got your bitch starstruck, all fuss
Got five figures in my offers
My how the times have changed
I might leave tour and go buy the Range
I see the snakes, I see the fakes
I see 'em straight through designer frames
I just got crib out in L.A
I get my pick at the thots, but she can not stay
If she had her way she'd be picking the locks
Got a shower big enough to dance in
With your favorite singer and the dancers
In the party, in the back booming
Rep the city like I'm Pat Ewing
Fiends high as bald eagles
And my product all legal
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit

[Hook 3: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Like I do my Saint Laurents
She can't wait to take 'em off
Complimenting my expensive jeans
Turn your housewife to a thot-ty
Thought a bitch cadance made a thizz face
All these niggas do is copy, wait what?
We ain't buying none of that shit, that shit
For the birds and the fact is, you just a gnat to a pterodactyl
However unbalanced that is, this ain't about status
We cease and desisting y'all, the teachers dismissing ya'll
Insisting you give it up
Cole World, codeine in my cup
Fiends

[Hook 4: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
(You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives)

[Outro: Bas]
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit
Pissed off my scholarship quick
Now I'm back in the town
I'm back in the town
A nigga been searching for purpose
There's nothin' around
