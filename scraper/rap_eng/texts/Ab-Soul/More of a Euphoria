[Intro: Ab-Soul]
You know it feel like that, though

[Verse 1]
Yes, you were designed to fail
No, you will never attain everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Don’t take responsibility for your actions anyway
In any way, shape, form, or fashion
Dont be rational for goodness sake, a-dapt
There's no need to stand up, act like you got bad back
Spasms that you can't take
You are not invincible, imbecile you can break
I pity you, pitiful and I hope you go to hell
Even if the pit is full
Let's make that a mandate
I hope you hate what I did to you, did I get to you?

[Hook: Alori joh]
Everybody, wants to, be victorious
We can make this (world) more of a euphoria

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yes, you were designed to fail
No, you will never attain everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Think of all the bad decisions you made
In the past even to this day
Drive yourself mad, run out of gas on the information interstate
That might be a bit much if it is in my intents to offend ya
And leave dents in your confidence
Blow your fuse, sabotage your views
So you can keep a funky attitude, like the parliament
And everyday I do, that’s why you never grew

[Hook: Alori joh]
Everybody, wants to, be victorious
We can make this (world) more of a euphoria

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
No, you weren't designed to fail
Yes, you were meant to attain everything
What a magnificent brain
Such benevolent ways, look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look her straight
In the face, come to grips with who you are and
Who you ain't
Where you going, where you been
Help your family, help your friends
Plant a seed, teach, he or she to be the, deity
The media will never perceive us
As, get your five dolla' ass up
Make change, make a way for today
Tomorrow was yesterday
Find a fine line between time and space
Contact the cosmos and you'll hear 'em say

[Hook: Alori joh]
Everybody, wants to, be victorious
We can make this (world) more of a euphoria

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
The veil is being raised
For many, we are living in the last days
For us, it's only the beginning
One love, one conscious, one kinetic mind
HiiiPower!
