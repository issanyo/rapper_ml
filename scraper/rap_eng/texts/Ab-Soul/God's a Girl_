[Intro]
Hey Soul
Wassup Ju Ju?
I finally figured out why the chicken crossed the road
The sun rose, so she sucked the cock's cock to keep his beak closed

[Interlude]
Thank God for girls
God's a girl, gorgeous girls
God's a girl, too good to me
A bunch of girls, thank God for girls (ay man)

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' lie, you got me cryin' with a hard dick (amen)
How I love you so much that I hate this shit?
I get it, get it, I (don't stop)
You ain't doin' your job if she don't say (oh, my god)
Come have sex with Jesus
Come have sex with Jesus (Soulo) come have sex with Jesus
I get it, get it, I (don't stop)
You ain't doin' your job if you don't say (oh, my god)

[Pre-Verse]
Every single time, yeah
And all I got is goddesses, I'm a heroine addict

[Interlude 2]
That's it, that's it
Yeah cause I.. I really wanted to talk about like
You know, it's crazy how, you know
How Jesus is in the bible, he don't get no pussy at all
A 33 year old virgin, yeah it's crazy
Like all the drugs are girls (white girl) Mary, Molly
Yeah for real, they're all named after girls
And they're really like female plants and shit
Bet you they gon' shake they ass to that though for real, on God
Yes Lord (Black Lip Pastor)
We in Frankie's castle with the pack though (Soulo)
(Motherfucking PaKK Music)

[Verse]
Top want me to go to rehab, told him I would go too
Probably just relapse, cause that's what ill niggas do
Real ill, won't even pop a bottle without poppin' a pill
Can't have a meal without picking up the bill
Should be more concerned with my health
But I'ma die trying to get this wealth, pay attention nigga
I've been going platinum, they just politicking
Fuck boys acting up, like an adult film audition
I'm just eating these rappers up, sending artists to the mortician
I'm just with my niggas hanging, case of champagne
Need some water but I'd rather me a martyr for the cause
Nigga y'all niggas still don't get it
The juvenile that never went to juvenile hall
It was 400 degrees on Turmont
The homies playing with the strap off safety
And my lady at the time she stayed on gun lock
The irony in that alone is crazy
I come up with shit like that that's why they say I'm crazy
Maybe, I'm with the shits, I'm off the shits
The (YMF) (Soul!)
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
But I guarantee she make it to the penthouse naked
You niggas been outdated
Like the bitches I dated way way way way back when
Now I'm getting brain in the tinted Maybach Benz
It's rented but I'm in it nigga
I done paid back more insufficient funds in the last 5 months
Than you gonna make in this whole year
On the mountain top about to cry
Cause it gets so lonely up here, shit
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?
In this jaded generation of complacency
Siri don't even take us seriously
But that's some other shit just being honest with you
Right hand on the bible with you (amen)
My ancestors came on the mothership
So I got to take it farther nigga that makes sense
My head in the clouds
Getting head in the clouds by an angel in disguise
She an angel in disguise
And D'evils gonna be my demise, I swear that God's a (girl, bitch)
