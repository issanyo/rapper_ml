[Intro]
(Soulo taught me...)
See, yeah, my nigga, see
See yes this where sci-fi meets swag, my nigga
Like, like, like the Holy Bible in a Gucci Bag, my nigga, swag
['Cause I'm swagging on 'em]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Oh you the kid, I'm Joseph Kony
Chip off the block, since puffy socks in my Saucony
I touch stock, she suck cock
She dancing Secret Sundays and I'm 'bout to prey
I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
She got that magical vaginal, let me hocus poke
Row, row, row my boat gently down your stream
She into Alexander McQueen but she ain't met the king
(Soulo, Soulo, Soulo, Soulo) kiss the fucking ring ho
TDE we got the belt, hold it down if nothing else
And this is my new single, cut the cheese it's bout to melt
Lean in my cup, pinky up like Dr. Evil (zip it)
Currently we seeing deeds like Adam Sandler
ScHoolboy Q, OG, and dirty pineapple Fanta
And I ain't never been a mothafuckin' lick
'less I'm right around the clit, druggys with hoes, O's and 4's

[Hook]
I'm smoking dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag so mean, on them fucking hoes
I'm smoking dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag so mean, on them fucking hoes

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Oh, that's your bitch? Well, bruh, she on me
I made her lick my sack, then work the top, then fuck the homies
Got the block hot, cause I set it off
No I'm not Weezy, bitch, I'm wheezy from that chronic cough
Yeah, I'm smoking dope, you can smell it in my beard
Have no fear, saviour of the gangster rap is fucking here
Word around town, SOPA tryna shut it down
How that sound I'm from the underground, they're gonna make me slang a pound
Figg Row (Figg Row) Figg Row (Figg Row)
Bitch, what you know about Figg Row? (Figg Row)
This is original gangster, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Smoke it, shoot it, sniff it, smell it, inhale it, sip it, whatever
Just mix dope with your flavor uh, uh, uh, yeah
In interviews they always asking me about a list
Knowing damn well I'm looking like I'm slinging bricks
Ever see an ex-student get a half a ticket
Think I'm lying, just ask Jimmy, that check was mine as soon as we signed

[Hook]
I'm smoking dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag so mean, on them fucking hoes
I'm smoking dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag so mean, on them fucking hoes

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q]
Soulo ho! Groovy Q!
I'm high as fuck, nigga me too
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Fendi on, I might throw a fit
Deadline, hoodie on like Trayvon
Heard it through the grapevine
We got extra pills, lean and shrooms
Life for me is just weed and brews
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)
