I feel like I'm finished soul searching
I feel like I know my sole purpose
Colder than a winter solstice
You're a dope dealer if you sold this
Sold everywhere if you ain't know this
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't con soul
Known to consolidate hopin' those who listening
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm soliciting
Soul train, soul plane, those are no brainers
Soul so thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day and a half of these eight and a halves
Solidify why I'm the greatest to rap
Yo, yo, yo
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go, Soul gon' shine
Everybody knows like Beyonce and Solange
Put the fucking soul on
We really out here, but we ain't at the [soulon?]
A pair of parasoles, they call slight [?]
Kid from Del Amo with a flow that's so universal
Soul
