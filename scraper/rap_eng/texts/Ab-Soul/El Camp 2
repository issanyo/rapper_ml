Verse 1 [Ab-Soul]
They found me under the sea, with three dollars and sixty cents
So why would it make any sense for me to not make any since
The curly head, black lipped kid
That works at Magic Disk, be on some shit
I take a stand then make you sit
You take a stand, and then you snitch
What part of the game is that huh?
Pardon my frame of mind, but if you get out of line, it'll be a disaster
I take trips and pass out the most
Monumental rapper, don't ever go toe to toe
With those who's over dosing, on the antidote
Effortless I wreck this shit
Ab-Soul-loutly definite
Bet your deficite, that you ain't testing it
I'm excellence on ecstasy
If you can fathom such a combo, off the Humboldt
Smellin' like I'm lightin' a pine cone
Feeling like my mind got caught in a cyclone
I should put a spell on you niggas, like a typo
TaeBeast, TDE, El Campo
Carson, K-I-N-G, Del amo

Verse 2 [Schoolboy Q]
Uh, sittin' in my homeboy's apartment
In them dirty halls, burner in my dirty draws.... watch it!
For the boys that want it all, just got into altercation at the mall
But niggas know my protocol, ready for my homicide
Put me in a position, to have my finger itchin'
Don't jump up in the game if you ain't ready for the kitchen
Cause best believe the stove hot, cooking up beef up in the box till my time stop
Barb wires and pig cops
Every door get into locks, phone ain't got no dial tone
Look up and the clouds gone, hungry and my childs gone
Solitary mind state, push ups help me stay straight
Noodles help maintain, reading helps me isolate
Troubles help me concentrate, enemies evacuate
Let me hyperventilate
Hoping that my girl'll still be on it and the mother fuckers call me in the mornin'
(Roll it up!)

Verse 3 [Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck that shit, I'mma blow it up
Fuck that shit, I'mma load it up
Dump that clip, like a movie script
Whether blood or crip, I don't give a fuck
I'mma live it up, my time is now
Time and time again, I got that sound
That'll drown, Titanic, in Atlantic's ocean
I'm hoping, that they both go down
Nigga please, nigga hand your bitch your keys
So she can push your humvee, to my place we can smoke your weed
Pray to god that I'm not god, MC bumped in your ipod
Simply I am the CyHi of Centennial High don't give me no tie
I ready made my business mine, dec-i-mals are definite
Deficate on music mates, and bet, I do it delicate-ly
Ignore your celiba-cy and then tell you fuck you
Aye what the fuck you want, my fucking dick, you fucking cunt
Get off my n-u-t, s, he yes, got that unorthodox flow
Niggas is trapped, they don't hold no wraps but they calling 5-0
Smash in a El Dorado, whip it straight, till the fender break
In the middle of the street, where the criminals be
While I blaze this heat from the Tae Beast.... tape
Kendrick Lamar
