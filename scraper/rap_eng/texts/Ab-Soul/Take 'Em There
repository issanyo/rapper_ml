[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Ha, supernatural
Tae Beast, Ab-Soul, yeah
Blink twice, and I’m goin’

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I just wanna vent, you know
Get on some shit you don’t
They ask me how I do it
I tell ‘em you askin’ the wrong human
Soon as I hit the booth it gets humid
I’m shootin’ at vanilla skies
My dreams are lucid
Hallucinatin’, creatin’ the unheard of
I try to give ‘em life, but they just want murda
So should I sacrifice my integrity and write like they like
So I could become a celebrity?

[Hook: Ab-Soul and Alori Joh]
Should I take ‘em there? (Hey)
Can I take ‘em there? (Hey)
Can I take ‘em there? (Hey)
I know that I can go anywhere with music, music
Can I take ‘em there?
I know that I can go anywhere with music, music

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
It’s just, I just wanna speak from the heart
Remove the first two letters, and you got art
I don’t wanna give it too much thought
I just wanted to come natural
Whites used to hang blacks
Now Barack hanging in the White House
Is this something that we should value?
Or is it just, somethin’ to cover up
The more corrupt, shit that’s around you?
I found a penny on the ground that read that
Things don’t ever change over Abraham’s brain
And I know it sounds strange but there’s a kid right now
Savin’ up to get a Range and a couple gold chains
Before a place to stay, priorities gone astray
Like a child without an owner or bullet without a name
And honestly I’m the same, just in a different way
So I say

[Hook: Ab-Soul and Alori Joh]
Should I take ‘em there? (Hey)
Can I take ‘em there? (Hey)
Can I take ‘em there? (Hey)
