[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
There's sixteen ounces to every pound
Some shit is 'bout to go down
Got sixty-four of 'em
That's four of 'em, smoke somethin'
Burn it down, this shit is four for a pound
Y'all need cream, that's equivalent to a sixteen
See, when I'm rappin' I'm trappin'
Wasn't really good, well, subtract
Then I'm steady addin', this is just a fraction
Blunt matchin' after matchin'
Matchin' after matchin'
All by myself, ask Michael Phelps
Bean pies and Philadelph' cheesesteaks on the menu
Projects' right across from the venue
After the show, I went outside and mingled
I'm feelin' safe with the homie named God who's great
Elijah Muhammad the 8th
The Muslim homie told me he's straight
Sent him a dub and a demo tape
Penetrate the streets with the heat
Like [inaudible], global warmin' in December
Bathe in the [inaudible], that's how the kids' raised
So a burner ain't nothin'
Shoot him in his back for cold frontin'
Let him hold somethin', he with the Devil down south
Tell his ass to walk it out
Burner in his mouth, blindfolded on the couch
Give me the loot, give me the loot 'fore I shoot
Rip a tooth and your tonsils too
Exit out your neck bone, man, your shit gone
I'm [inaudible] and notorious
Niggas always gettin' me understood
Better ask your hood, they know what's good
Warnin' shot, Q, bitch

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I could stand in a pool of gasoline lightin' a blunt
And never catch on fire
How come? You silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the Devil over the cheek
Gave him a third-degree burn
Iced it down the same week and told him, 'You'll be okay'
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplanin'
They hopin' that they catch they big break
What are you sayin'?
I feel I'm the one like a magician
With a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane
I gets ignorant with you
Snap your picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world with nuts in my palm
And drinkin' Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shootin' arm
Now that's a stretch, Ab-Soul
Like the fifty-mile strip when I'm pimpin' these hoes
Call me Dolemite, no, I take that back
Found out he gay as a [inaudible] or the way that they rap

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I wish I had the very first verse I wrote
I'd spit it right now
So you can see the vast progression and the style
Started as a child
Now I'm a grown man like Benjamin Button in his fifties
Fuck with me
Still ain't learnt the power of a dollar, disregardin' Fif'
Not cause I don't like him, just cause I don't save shit
So high on my horse
If I fall off I get kicked by a hoof 'fore I hit the hood
And that was over they head, but I wish a nigga would
Disrespect my intellect, I'm a cocky individual
No subliminals, try to attack and I'll react like chemicals
The doc should've brought him some of my mom's inner tubes
Cause now I'm in the view of millions, takin' interviews
I got interludes better than your singles
Won't stop till I got a better reason to [inaudible]
And if any of y'all want a piece of the God
On 12/25 we send grief to your squad
The only problem I got now is label offers on the table
Like a table cloth is but I'm cautious
I'm like what Jaws is to crawfish
The big shot, that's why I talk my shit
That's why they on my dick
Like them little tricks that I taught your bitch
She'd probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies
You need to quit it, knock it off
I'm in your girl ear like a cotton swab
And anythin' I say, I'm a blame it on that alcohol
Like T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx
I'm here cause it's my time, you came to watch
Every day it's ceramics class, pass the pot
