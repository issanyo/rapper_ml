[Intro]
Aye............This thing on??
Yeah, what's going on y'all??
Once again.........Soul!
Just want to give you a piece of how I'm living

[Hook]
Lets talk about my lifestyle, I'm broke but almost famous how can I explain this?
I'm so close but yet so far, they say I'mma a star but that ain't quite my lifestlye
I'm broke but almost famous how should I explain this?
I'm so low thats why I get high, and that ain't a lie, it's just my lifestyle

[Verse 1:Ab-soul]
Fresh off the L.A.X tour no pay, no per diem, no shutting down stores
Hype manning for Jay Rock yeah it was fun of course, but the set was too short
To perform one of my songs, I reaped a few benefits and met some important people
That if people see you with they gonna' want to meet you
We torn down stages, got groupie love, got high, stupid drunk, even scuffled in the club
I made it back in one piece thank the man above
Hadn't come to grips with niggas thinking I'm a blood
It's over when your neighborhood is full of crips
Luckily for me they shoes tied and niggas never trip
Scrapped up enough change to pay my phone bill
I got a past due balance but it's owed still
That's the shit I write about I swear I'm so real

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Jay Rock]
Chyeah, Soul!
Roll us a swisher up, lets get high
My mind right, im focused now
I know the trials, and tribulations
I ran wild, threw on an apron
Dishing birds out, imagine a boston market in a nickerson gardens
You ever seen a blood bargain?
Got fed and saw them Feds often
I never sleep you do that in coffins
Now, I can recall being down to my last straw
Thirsty for a burglar gun in my draws
Now I step on stage, people applaud
That alone should show you hard work pays off
My daughter is my world thats a blessing from god
And even when she cries I see myself in her eyes
For her I got to provide, till my demise, shit even if I died I'd probably come back to life
Nothings gonna stop me

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Ab-soul]
The homie hit me said he seen me on B.E.T
Like whats the deal with that??
You getting big homie, I use that type of shit as motovation
Which is important as a lawyers opening statement
If I bet a dollar bill my flow is worth a fortune
Would that mean I was cheap or that I can't support it
Some people see me as an icon, half of them show me
They got me in their iPod(good looking.........yeah)
But still my stories more relateable cause real is relative
As you and yo' momma's kids
An no I ain't as big as drake, but I'm capable
An I may not smoke an ounce but an eigth will do
An I promise you're safe where I'm taking you
On a journey through a day in my shoes
Where everybody thinks you're some kind of celebrity
But you can't even take your girl out for some food
Many would argue that i made a lot of wrong moves
But i stand behind myself like a shadow, when I'm in
A certain position under the moon, just think it all
Started from a text battle
What up D.Cash my nigga novik to, snake hollywood
I got it my nigga, swear to god I'm a phrophet like Elijah my nigga
And ain't nothing gonna stop it my nigga
