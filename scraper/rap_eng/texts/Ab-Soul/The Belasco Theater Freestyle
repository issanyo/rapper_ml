I've got so many styles
So many different ways that I can detract this track
My train of thought (?)
The air horn (?)
I'm out of control, systematically synthetic, uh
Supremacy of what many may know is Top Dawg
The army, better yet, the navy, bark, bark
The boys who cried wolf don't be lying 'round these parts
Pardon my reverent, if you ain't mentioned it yet, I rather that
I believe everything happens for a reason
Like, some niggas do get me young for no reason
But, some niggas be makin' some B.o.B tour freezin', cous
Stop, walk, stop, walk
How? (?), I'm the highest in the street
These bitches freeze up when they see me
I mean, you see me and you seaweed like the ocean
I make your waviest (?), she probably over there
