[Verse 1: Da$H]
Finger paints all on the paper got the joint tastin' like
Now-A-Laters, I fuck her now and then she shower later
All of my power seems to cower haters
Cars ?, get my flowers catered
Weed on delivery 'case you ain't hearing me nigga
It's clear to me nigga
Most of these rappers ain't what they appear to be, I'm who they here to see nigga
It's only evident, Grandmama said my talent Heaven-sent
But I still fuck hoes, get bent
Think Hell is my home address
In my loaded Guess, rollin' through your city in a stolen vlex
Hoe get flexed, while I choke the chef
He overcooked the meal, battle scars on the whip, I named it Seal
Weed by the field, dark liquor, niggas who's trained to kill
Crackin' the seal on the brick, measure and pour up my fix
Prescription beverage give me leverage on the bars that I pick
Mentally sick, think I'm criminal minded
Lost my brain, leave a message on my line if you find it, motherfucka

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, don't forget the dash
My nigga Da$H, FifthGod, full tank of gas
I light a match and write a rap, you ask why?
It's 'cause I blew/blue up just like the sky
Clever yessir, bet your bottom dollar
Or your favorite pair of red bottoms, it's not a problem
I don't give a fuck, no condom will be needed
You lookin' for luck? No skill or preparation to receive it
Peel the plastic off a pack of 'ports, took a drag and ashed it
The apple of your eye is probably last night's applesauce
Jack your apple for less than a bowl of Applejacks
Real Hip-Hop, you rabbits had just been jackin' off
And these days I'm getting high enough to bite the clouds
I don't know which way is up, but it's going down
And this a Blank beat like not a sound
Sssssssshhhhh

[Verse 3: Radamiz]
This shit is a prank
She fuckin' for "Nike's", just keeping it Frank
I'm the one but I'm keeping the franks (hundreds)
I get rid of your stank
Fill me with thanks
Or I'm leaving your wifey like a Hillary Banks
Watch her hubby go die on a channel
Trigger finger the shit I can't handle, uhhh
How to blow in IRL and a URL
Without going D4L, this is Brooklyn pussy, get the details well
Hookah hoggin', Henny hoardin', eyes italic from mixing both up
Nasty like I'm doing it for Ill Will still
Put a mill' not a pill in the pockets of my real real real real real real
Uncle caught a body, crib got hit with robbery, all this made me 'bout it
You'd kill your mother for 100k plays and get fame through an internet router
Panic attacks and still play a show at Baby's All Right & shoot scenes for "poweR"
Debit don't swipe with a retweet or like, need enlightenment and prayer and dollar
My brodie was going through Coke fits
If he ain't spray the cane he thinks he not the man
Sage in my hand fuckin' roasted, no cleaning my mind I got too many plans
You made me confessing to God
Yesterday I could've did, died
I was 'posed to go a couple years ago, I write so I can stay alive
