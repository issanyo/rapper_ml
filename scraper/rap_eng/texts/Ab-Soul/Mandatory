[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I was raised in these streets boy you can't tell me nothing
Hop out the Crown Vic' with the fo' fo' dumping
My mama said I need help my cheese slipped off my cracker
Don't bring your bitch around me, if you do I'ma crack her
The hood made me who I am so that's who I'ma be dawg
Act tough sliding the 38. to be dawg
No one hotter I got lava I pop shotties at your neckcollar
Shed down stoves to buy Prada
If rap don't work, shit, I'm back at the spot
Selling good to the fiends, selling fly to cops
Gotta watch for them raids they damage the franchise
Nowadays gotta keep the toilet on standby
You snitchin' in the hood you ain't the one to stand by
Cause you could be a target once we order this homicide
Choppers come out and all hell breaks loose
See the devil in the flesh once it's aimed at you
Shit I walk around the 'jects with eyes at the back of my head
Some niggas wanna put my lifeline in the red
I pop the pistol if it's a issue to make my hand hot
Rip the tissue, your family miss you, I make your mama cry
"Oh, that boy he gone, he ain't never gangbanged he ain't doin no wrong"
Shut the fuck up, that nigga was a killer like me
Under his belt, he had ten killers like me
Niggas pray that they can remove the sinner like me
Come through, broad day, bad bitches with me
From South Central to Queens I make them talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be on the 1-0-5 in the wind
Pistol on my lap, wanna die you can bring a friend
It's mandatory
It's mandatory, my dude, if your chain shining bright Imma blow out your fuse
Run up in your dope spot like "Nobody move!"
Kill you right after I rob you, the unwritten rule
From South Central to ATL they talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be rollin' up chronic, sippin' Hen
Flying kites to my niggas doing life in the pen
Wanna die? bring a friend, we can make this a double date
So go round the block catchin 'em chilling and hit the brake
It's mandatory, it's mandatory that's most def
Check the murder rate, over here got the most death
Obama made president, but we still peddling
We want it in white, 100 game relevant
Carry shine don't slippin' insult my intelligence
Something in the trunk like the nuts in an elephant
Came for the paper and mayhem
Come between that, think twice get your bitch ass laid down
Mandatory!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Crown Victoria need a oil change
But I’m still feeling notorious, word to Biggie's name
Capital K. Dot
Revolutionary
Black stronger than Hancock
Hand on my cock
Fucker
The Los Angeles pitbull causing the racket
Serena Williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
Fuck with the man/wolf reekening your possession
I stare at the moon and then howl no question
Homie!
This is the part where you spaz out
Like if a nigga spit in yo' mouth
Or called your momma a bitch
Now that’s some ignorant shit
I’m a ignorant nigga
Think of Bernie Mac & Richard taking pictures with ya
With the brain of a million geniuses
Fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
Fucking faggot
You suck a dick and you laugh it to the bank, Bob Saget
Give up the chips and make the life with paralyses, chaos, havoc
Boycott who evers the best, including Khaled
I pray to God you love your success cause when I have it
You’ll never get a piece, I lay careers out in the streets
If a meteorite had hit me, I be good in a week
If a alligator had bit me, I bet he'd break his teeth
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, my dude
You a square beyond squares like a rubix cube
I would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
To the peddle of this vehicular Porsche I move
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
One man man slaughter tell the world to record me
I don’t care if he’s 6'7, I’ll come to him shortly

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I ain’t lying, been a john since a nigga was a shorty
Young nigga smoking bub, but I’m wise like a 40
Aye rappers
You rappers are papier-mâché
Meaning I could build you up & break you down the same day
It’s Mandatory!
It’s Mandatory my nigg!
Word, sentence, paragraph, story my nigg
Fuck-niggas must fuck niggas
Cross genders
I’m psycho on the microphone
Pick up niggas
It’s Mandatory!
Now get me some more of that beat

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
Hol' Up!
I got it Ab-Soul let me go sea floor deep
I’m C4
You a fool if you don’t pick up your heat
Then Bonsoir
Bombs away nigga, bon appétit
I’m Rodney King as I endure beat after beat
Week after week, like you & him lifting weights in the streets
I do my thing and take a breather, then come again
Aiming for your temple like a preacher, as I sin
It's Mandatory!
