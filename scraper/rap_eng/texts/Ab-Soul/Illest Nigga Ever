[Hook: Kush Kelz]
Lord knows
I've been waiting for so long
My heart cold
Spit one verse and they all froze

[Chorus: Kush Kelz]
Illest nigga ever
White mink down to the floor
Don't touch me
Illest nigga ever
Hopping off the plane jet lagged
Don't rush me
Illest nigga ever
Blunt after blunt after blunt
How you do that?
Illest nigga ever
Been one-hunna from the start
Y'all knew that

[Verse: Kush Kelz]
Chauffeur open doors on arrival
Mink to the floor,  let it rock though
Showing up three hours late, (I'm late)
My bad the whip hit a pot-hole (Damn)
Check out the loafers
These cost more than the sofa
Same season everything obey
2015 Rolle
Trying to get in position to make a mill
I can't give a fuck how a hater feel
Most of these niggas still owe money
I did this shit with my own money
Investing, I had to get a lot
Imagine it started with cinder blocks
Now these bitches drink from the bottle
I'm serving them penis coladas (You nasty)
Walk around daily with 20 large in my pocket
Just in case I see shit I like
I think i'm the illest dealer ever
Need my a plaque just for living life
And when you see me
I don't know you nigga
I just say what's up to you yo be polite
Been 100 from the start
And I swear to God I don lived twice

[Hook: Kush Kelz]
Lord knows
I've been waiting for so long
My heart cold
Spit one verse and they all froze

[Chorus: Kush Kelz]
Illest nigga ever
White mink down to the floor
Don't touch me
Illest nigga ever
Hopping off the plane jet lagged
Don't rush me
Illest nigga ever
Blunt after blunt after blunt
How you do that?
Illest nigga ever
Been one-hunna from the start
Y'all knew that

[Verse: Ab-Soul]
Dropped a dose in a Kelz Orange Soda
Just landed in New York but I'm smoking California
Soulo Ho the prophet and I got it in my pocket
Nigga, when you getting green, it's impossible to stop it
I be getting high just so I can drop the knowledge
Nigga I ain't broke a sweat in these thousand dollar joggers
So when I say I'm fly, that's an understatement
And I treat the paper just like the cockpit
I pilot. (Soul)
I heard I was underrated
I prefer rated-X
Told them I gotta eat
I ate and made a mess
Blew a lotta cash on
Drugs, high fashion, and sex
Acquired by my writings
Deciphering ancient text
But roll that weed nigga
Shake that ass hoe
I'm the illest nigga, check my Wikipedia
Steven-Johnson syndrome.(soul)
Bathe an Ape, Boxer-briefs
300 dollar belt for nothing
Bastard passed the back to pass the Black Lip
As he passed the passage to the public
Lord knows
They been waiting for soulo
Soulo

[Hook: Kush Kelz]
Lord knows
I've been waiting for so long
My heart cold
Spit one verse and they all froze

[Chorus: Kush Kelz]
Illest nigga ever
White mink down to the floor
Don't touch me
Illest nigga ever
Hopping off the plane jet lagged
Don't rush me
Illest nigga ever
Blunt after blunt after blunt
How you do that?
Illest nigga ever
Been one-hunna from the start
Y'all knew that

[Outro: Kush Kelz]
My heart cold
Spit one verse and they all froze
Illest nigga ever
White mink down to the floor
Don't touch me
Illest nigga ever
Hopping off the plane jet lagged
Don't rush me
Illest nigga ever
Blunt after blunt after blunt
How you do that?
Illest nigga ever
Been one-hunna from the start
Y'all knew that
Illest nigga ever
Y'all knew that
Illest nigga ever
Y'all knew that
Illest nigga ever
Y'all knew that
Illest nigga ever
Y'all knew that
