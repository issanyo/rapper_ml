I've been getting a taste of how the world spins
Watching my childhood slipping away
Willing to pay
To turn the hands back on the clock
When I was passing the block
With my hat on cock
Troublesome not many accomplishments, fatherless
And out of all this; still I press
???? All eyes ???????
And the tide is spinning out of my grasp it seems; like
When I'm gone will any of y'all ask for me; I'm
The rap competitor
No different from the snotty nose who stole cash from the register
Ill smash through a plethora
Of obstacles and blocks mentioning with being relevant now
I'm just tryna get to heaven and smile , y'all
I'm passing you
And like a tide I'm absolute
