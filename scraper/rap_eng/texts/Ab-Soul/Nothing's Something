[Interpolation]
Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

[Verse 1]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
‘Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
I can't even take a piss, without a nigga tryna take a pic
I just want to fuck a few hoes, take my pick
Backwoods with the hash in 'em
Bad bitch, skinny jeans, fat ass in 'em
You ain't never seen a lime of light
I might fuck around and do a line tonight
Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fucking to the Weeknd, on the weekend
That ain't too provocative, is it?
If it's not, that's just a warning
Know I got it if you want, and

[Bridge]
I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothin'
No, this shit ain't about nothin'
But it's gotta be somethin'
They say I'm so selfish, I ain't think about nothin'
'Less it's making me somethin'
Matter fact, fuck that, I ain't worried about nothin'
No, I ain't worried about nothin', it's always somethin'

[Hook]
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
It's always something
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights

[Verse 2]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
‘Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
We in the world of material vixens in your videos…
Hermes belt, shirt will make your ho melt
Issey Miyake all over my body
My heart beats off beat, still the life of the party
YSL, iPhone wireless cell
I'm high as hell, by the end of the night
I might need bail if a nigga test my might
I ain't a bitch for nothin', end of discussion, and

[Bridge]
I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothin'
No, this shit ain't about nothin'
But it's gotta be somethin'
They say I'm so selfish, I ain't think about nothin'
'Less it's making me somethin'
Matter fact, fuck that, I ain't worried about nothin'
No, I ain't worried about nothin', it's always somethin'

[Hook]
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
It's always something
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
