[hook: Javonte & Ab-Soul]
The chicks be on me (hi haters)
I know they want me
But me i'm balling
Got the fellas hating on me (Hi haters)
The chicks be on me (Hi haters)
I know they want me
But me i'm balling
Got the fellas hating on me

[Verse 1]
Hi haters, i smell at them
Steady getting wild with them, outlasting
All competition my swag is pass your comprehension
But you don't need hooked on phonics to read my moves
Hooked on chronic with a page to moto
Wait up, please bring over a few bottles
Of the best champagne , and put it on ice (ice)
If you gonna put it on her , put it on right
Black cocktail dress, put it on tight
If you looking of a man of honor
I'm robert de niro or Cuba Gooding Jr all night
Long as a [???] , you waking up the plummer
You go to sleep to a pipe dream
I make her melt like ice-cream
And now she wanna cold it back to my team
Which reminds me...
