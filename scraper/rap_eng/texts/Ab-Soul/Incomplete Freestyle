[Verse 1]
Yo,yo
Truly on point naturally on task creating history everyday and my name's Ab Dash
Soul motherfucker at least ask Etta James
As a Cadillac record played? Me never that
Act like you know, don't get rammed shacked
By the rat pack see I'm the black Humfrey Bogart
Puffed in black stone hella smart ass hole
See this my culinary art how I cook up
Such food for thought clear the kitchen it's finna get hot
Uh, master chef, no account to cash your check
You niggas ain't half of half of half my best
Uh, champagne wishes some green in my swishers
A Nicki Minaj with two 5 star bitches
Ladies and gentlemen this is a look inside the mind of the demented
And everything I said I swear I meant It
Listen fascinated by the tactics of a Jeffery Daumer
Eat your ass up a cannibal for the dollar
It's tangible I'm off the top rhyming noodles, that's understandable
The Last Samurai here to tear a guy apart
Tie a piece of barbed wire around his heart
If he's gased up he gets boa constricted until he farts
If he talks and it don't correspond to his walk
He walks the plank Captain Hook went hard Peter was gay
You'll never never land a spot on our roster that way
Not a Rasta but I smoke like a wailer they know
In serving niggas tip the waiter before you leave the table
God dammit just found another crack up in my halo
Are you comprehending am I condescending
Or am I kindly sending you a message kind of quickly
I never get to busy to get busy, simply stunning your Mrs. can't miss me
Engine gunning headed for the finish line but not the sneaker store
I need that first place prize the blue ribbon in the ski
I'm Stevie Wonder getting high
What you even speaking for you're iller
When mute is on carry on ha-ha
And I ain't gotta talk that white to bury y'all
The truth will set you free and me I'm whip and chain free
Literally no car no jewelry just a brain full of buffoonery between you and me
