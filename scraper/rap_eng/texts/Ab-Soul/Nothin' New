[Intro]
Yeah, this is how
Ab-Soul and AAhyasis live

[Verse 1]
Hello, good morning, this is more than just a feeling I reckon
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans in France playing my records
I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it
Don't forget the dash in my name, when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it
I'm a god MC, not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
Let a reverend run in my Adidas
He'll see that despite all his dislikes, I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments, but I don't seem to break
To many of them either, try to understand me
Obama said “Yes we can,” but that can't be
Cause we was raising money for his campaign, T-shirt, plates, and mugs
But won't do the same in our own community, what the fuck?
I said what the fuck?

[Chorus]
And it ain't nothing new, all I do is eat, sleep and shit
Reflect on my life, find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Depend on my sight, ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return
It ain't nothin' new

[Verse 2]
How's it going, good afternoon
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
It's funny though, I could have just told a lie
And made it true to taint the mood, you think I am what I ain't
Like a saint or fake
We could go toe to toe, your choice it's no debate
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams here coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
In sheer disbelief, tell me how I can get high
As the sky and keep my ear to the streets
At the same time, no diamonds in my watch
Can I still shine, will anybody watch?
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean no disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect, not to reject
Don't press eject, I said don't press eject (Soul!)

[Chorus]
And it ain't nothing new, all I do is eat, sleep and shit
Reflect on my life, find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Depend on my sight, ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return
It ain't nothin' new


[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
Free in body, mind and soul

[Outro]
No idea's original, it's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
If you base your happiness around material, women
And large paper, that means your inferior not major
