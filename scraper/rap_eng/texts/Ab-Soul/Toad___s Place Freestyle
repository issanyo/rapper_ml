[Verse 1]
If this is Greece, I'm Socrates and you're Plato
We're shapin' the universe
While my classmates play with Play-Doh, I tell no fable
The evils'll make you want to sell your halo
Deceitful bitches with they intention to deplete your riches
Won't you open your eyes
Chain-smokin' tryin' to free my mind
I got it twisted like Twizzlers, but trust me, I'll be fine
'Cause every dark cloud has a silver line
Which means I'll turn my silverspoon to gold in no time
Ab-Soul, loot in my pocket
Reefer on my back, knowledge in my noggin
I pour up four and roll up four blunts
So much for my sorrow
And we gon run it back if I live to see tomorrow
