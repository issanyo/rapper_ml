[Introduction: Asaad  aka Young27]

It's Young27 nigga
Flame up
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Asaad aka Young 27 & **Ab-Soul**]

$600 on my Rock Tee, shopping just exhausts me
A Starbucks- good garnered up cold coffee
Tell them don't get exposed, don't get exposed!
**(Don't get exposed)**
Highly decorated niggas feelin' the flow
$600 on my Jesus sandals
Good designers, long lasting
Blunt wrap, Raw paper rappin' never at all passin'
Tell them don't get it exposed!
Don't get it exposed!
**(Don't get it exposed)**
Highly decorated niggas feelin' the flow

[Verse 2: Asaad & **Ab-Soul**]

White lighter and the system jolted
Voss water, but we into potent
The antiquated ultra innovative
Truly great competition get eliminated
Finally adjusted thrusted decorated
My enemies and foes they get decimated
Milfs like pies, pussy on the Vulvic
Their eyes were watching God but they wasn't open
Solo a stoner like my nigga Soul **(Soulo!)**
Distractions never happen once you reach a goal
It's such a feeling when the Grim Reaper's sleepin' over
Angel's uber in my chauffeur, devil on one shoulder
Papa was a rolling stone, I'ma speeding boulder
In the morning making waffles, your bitch sleeping over
Fully awake, immune to sleeping powder
Specific ass facts, I'm sippin' TÅ· Nant in the shower
Overdose on new ideas every hour, colored people time
You know- 5 minutes...
That's the end of the beat?
