[Verse 1]
Why is it they pray I fall?
Cause I'm close and they far?
They ain't raw, more like medium-well
Do like a loc in all blue in a room of Pirus
See for yourself cause I do
I'm even evil as hell
Froze over by the flow, niggas started with snow
Ride the beat like skis down an aeroslope
Finna start an avalanche, find shelter for your quotes
Shh, I'm on a whole 'nother boat
Y'all niggas need to get a grip, your whole shit a joke
I'm off the top, y'all slow
Take it back a couple notches while I travel up
Ab-Soul, bang the gavel or what?
No judge, I'm just in this bitch, actin' nuts like cashews
And I rap dudes around gas axles until they blow up
Fire, matches, you want to test, uh, Ab, fantastic
And I never stop, never slack like zoo bottoms
Y'all stuck in leather hats
Back in the eighties, I was doin' this shit
Still ain't had no babies, but I'm the man
Got my girl tied up
And I land somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle
So you can try angles if you want, but I doubt it
Reasonably, yeah, uh, leave your fleet and all types of shit
Like dogs in the motherfuckin' fall, no hydrant to piss on
Ab-Soul, don't piss me off, dog
Cause once again it's on like (?)
Got (?), I'm way (?), y'all niggas actin' like May, dude
Minor hot, but I'm June
So y'all'd stay tuned, Ab-Soul got it from a day out
Correspond to the the day I lay in the tomb
Y'all know what it is, absolutely the best
Yeah, no diamonds on my wrist or my neck
I'm still fresh to death
Might've seen this or you might've seen that
This the True Religion shit, pants all red
But that's fashion, so why have it?
Ab-Soul, shit, movin' through traffic with no car, just bars
