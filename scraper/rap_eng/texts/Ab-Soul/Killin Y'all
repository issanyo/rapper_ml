[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Black-lip bastard, destined to be a bastard Crip
But I passed on it to make classic hits
I pray I'm forgiven for not being down or
Putting the work in that certain niggas did, reason behind they service
In the pen partially why I don't write
I just pull it out the wind, sometime I can't sleep at night
I be thinking 'bout my friends, know they up to no good, it's all bad
I seen the yellow tape at Del's and almost had a heart attack
You never know with this shit, I don't understand
Kids carry cannons on Instagram, but crying when the cuffs on they hands
It's out my hands, it's two sides to every story
And I ain't a judge or signed up for jury duty
My youth was stolen moving too quick, it's sick, though
Cause Vince know what I know now when I'm 26
We still moving further, hope seeds grow to be
Trees and not just bushes hiding burners

[Hook]
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without--

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Call the gang unit, they know the name, foolie
I truly was built for the shit
I'm in the ring cooling right by where the enemies live
You know you can't kill a giant with a lucky shot
Aim for the head when you fuck with God Jehovah
I hopefully be speaking the colder the beat, snitching
We doming your niece, homies as cold as police
Momma had told us as kids never to shit where you eat
And got a clip for the heat, .357, I think I'm Itch Dawg
Niggas know I'm 65 'til I'm six feet
Under where they took us undercovers parked on Orizaba
Dogs up in the yard of the abandoned where we hide the choppers
I couldn't hide from the Karma, you see, it followed me
Fuck it! Get it cracking in public, these niggas rap for the fashion
They want the mansion, they puppets
A puppet master will bust and that chamber talk but I'm muzzled

[Hook]
