[Verse 1]
This that dopamine, I mean dope
Do the drugs, don't let the drugs do you
I'm morpheus on morphine in the Matrix - to be continued
(There is only one nigga)
Y'all don't see any 0's
I don't have any foes
I go over so many fore heads
Head before sex, yes
Pull my card and you'll find I was a warrior this whole time like American Express
Might roam the wrong necks
This roaming fee is more than your rent
You know how many times I've blew checks?
You think you're really verified by a blue check?
Aw, nah
Middle fingers to all y'all
Dry snitching
I got cotton mouth
That's like chocolate for water
Common ground? My nigga calm it down
I leave quiet storms on wav. files
I made those days mocking a common sound
Then they wrote me off like I wrote it down

[Hook]
Right (solo)
Kitty Flip!
Top Dawg nigga
Kitty Flip!
Don't talk nigga, what?
Top Dawg nigga
Kitty flip!
What's that?
Kitty Flip!
