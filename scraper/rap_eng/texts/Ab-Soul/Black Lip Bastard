[Intro]
Yaow!
Yaow!
Yaow! Yeah!

[Hook]
Black lip bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffing on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs blackened out
Smoke 'til I'm blacking out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime

[Interlude]
Do it! Do it! Do it! (Black...)
Do it! Do it! Do it!

[Verse 1]
Black lip bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffing on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs blackened out
Hot box like Pacquiao packed in the steamroom
That ain't eucalyptus you sniffing, it's weed, fool
We in this motherfucker, thick ass, high like my bitch
Gimme room like a Motel 6 or meet your doom
And tell 'em this: I got more participants
That think it's just a myth (yeah...)
Adjust your motherfucking stereo so I can drop the bomb on you
And watch your fucking ears explode
Soul!

[Bridge]
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
Nigga, squaaaad, bitch!
And all we do is do it!
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
Nigga, squaaaad
And all we do is do it! (yeah!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the highest nigga at the bottom of the totem pole
And I ain't sweating shit, man, I'm cooler than where sodas go
Fuck so and so, long as Soul show up, ho
Tell Doe po' up, I'm finna go in
Blowing Ls, not taking Ls, go win
Do a nigga squad, you will not survive
You ain't on this side, you are living lies
Put two and two together, I'm the one, high five (haaaa!)
Mobbing like I'm tryna catch a case
The dick make your chick jaw drop, Ma, catch your face
Eating rappers on a plate like etouff√©e
I do this every day, this verse is a eighth of yay
When you look at me, what do you see?
If I wasn't in Black Hippy, I'd be the fourth Fugee
Unruly, seeking redemption in light of Tookie
The game is all ours like violent movies (oh!)

[Bridge]
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
Nigga, squaaaad, bitch!
And all we do is do it! (yawk!)
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
Nigga, squaaaad
And all we do is do it! (uhh!)

[Hook]
Black lip bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffing on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs blackened out
Smoke 'til I'm blacking out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime

[Verse 3]
Black Panther party reincarnated, y'all hate it
Niggas tryna put a hex on me like the Star of David
Everything I say is real
Got a few jewels in high places, you know the deal
Fuck you niggas talking 'bout?
Your run is over like the Oprah Show, walk it out
Geah! They say I'm really out my mind, mane
All do is get high and play mind games (hannh?)
This is my game, I payed off the referee
Been fouled since I was born like Jeffery
The only MC with telepathy
Fuck that, the only celebrity in 11-D (mmm...)
I swear to God, it won't be long
I have Tyler lighting bongs and reciting Psalms
I'm an angel with an angle, what I mean, well
I'm just a demon that means well

[Bridge]
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it
Nigga, squaaaad, bitch!
And all we do is do it! (Q!)

[Outro]
Hey, Ali, you know what they call me?
You know what they call me, Ali? Huh?
Black lip bastard!
Big bitch!
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
Geah!
