[Hook: Ab-Soul]

See that's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
That's the sound right there
(Turn it up some Dot)
That's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
That's the sound right there
That's the sound right there

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]

Can you hear it?
This type of shit pulsate my spirit
This ain't pass interference
This is past interference
X men out like an action series
Hold on, mama I'm looking for some night cap, come
But I ain't playing no games I mean business
And every boss need a assistance
So is there anything you can assist with?
I need to know, like a yes man tryna let it go
I'm so professional, and I'm cold with it
Feeling a simile with eskimo
I been on point, it just don't equate with my decimals
Breaking down a swisher in a suite with a vista view
Rollin' up the vegetable
Friends looking at me like, "what's gotten into you?"
I'm looking back at em like, "life"
Same dudes who never gave a fuck about a kid
Now they want a feature cause they presentation weaker
Best thing making noise since the motherfuckin' speaker
Turn me up

[Hook: Ab-Soul]

Cause that's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
That's the sound right there
Said that's the sound right
That's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
That's the sound right there
That's the sound right there

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]

Open your ears
Fill you in on what's been going on over the years
Before I had the cue to go to the studio
I was on the desktop mic making music yo
No engineer, no EQ
Just a old Lox instrumental with a weak loop
Sorry if you out the loop
You should try a hula hoop
Steppin' to the mic after me is a death wish
Blow the candle of your career out, don't test this
I'm off the kush, why stress this?
Been used to getting criticism from skeptics
Now I can write a song full of flaws better than your whole catalog
Just playin' with it, need a analog, I'm saying nigga
I'm Santa Claus, slaying niggas
Cookin' up, souffle-ing niggas
I would say food for thought
But y'all ain't got taste, why waste it for?
I'm ready now they saying, "wait some more"
Chalking niggas up and erasing your boards
I'm in the Mitsubishi cause I couldn't afford
That's the sound right there, must have came from the Lord
God MC, yea
I'm just putting Los Angeles on
I only wear a fitted cause my halo is gone
Born center of attention, listen up
Like a eardrum on the tenth floor, goin' up!

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Cause that's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
Cause that's the sound right there
That's the sound right
(Look) That's the sound right there
Disrespect lil' homie if you want, I don't care
Cause that's the sound right there
That's the sound right there

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Yea, I wasn't born here, was dropped out of the air
Was fourth wheel, now I'm the heir
Before I made music it was musical chairs
Before I laid tracks I was wrapping du-rags around my hair
Lines on my forehead, I ain't care
Just wanted the bitches to know I was there
You niggas going through a identity crisis
Pumpin yourself up, you caught similar ices
You niggas wack, what's your life like
I already left man, y'all don't even write right
I'll put you to rest fam, night night
That was tight right
My wordplay is like none other
You can't even categorize, just check "other"
I'm rude like stepping on your step
