[Hook]
Broken dreams lost in the night
Pieces fallin’, pick ‘em up again
If I don’t win I swear I’ll die tryin'
Die tryin'

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
This Long Term shit real, check my motherfuckin' résumé
While they was gettin' fly, I was tryin' to levitate
Dabble through my catalogue, and after all you better say
I done keep it funky from the jump, but it doesn’t stank
And that might not register with he or her
Who doesn’t think, who doesn’t think he hasn’t earned
His spot in history without a body burned
It’s not that I’m an alchemist but I can turn
Any metal into gold, nothin' into somethin'
And when it feels like hell, I know that Heaven’s close
And it ain’t up for debate so change the subject
Sometimes I feel more awake with my eyes closed

[Hook]
Broken dreams lost in the night
Pieces fallin’, pick ‘em up again
If I don’t win I swear I’ll die tryin'
Die tryin'

[Verse 2: Fred The Godson]
Everybody needs somethin’
They see my show and it’s sold out
Wrists rocky, so the money I still loan out
Niggas buggin’ out, need an exterminator
I leave your body covered in chrome: the Terminator
I’ll change a hater’s concerns to be concerned with paper
Then he’ll produce like Erick Sermon, hear the sermon later
For now, I read they comments, I browse
Supreme, I’m on my taxes, I’m raisin' they eyebrows
You might be jumpin' out the window: Ron Browz
Comin' at me simple with my style, nah
Broken dreams led to fixed realities
I was trained like the Santa Fe, fatality, God

[Hook]
Broken dreams lost in the night
Pieces fallin’, pick ‘em up again
If I don’t win I swear I’ll die tryin'
Die tryin'

[Verse 3: Tsu Surf]
I’m lost dreamin', the walls screamin’, see y’all demons
Room spinnin' in hell and sin, what y’all breathin’?
Precautious paranoia keep me boxed in
And I ain’t lock a soul out, I got locked in
Blunt of loud to make light of my current fame
Current game, trio trippin' me Molly in this current day
Overseas women, I’m sinnin’, but that’s a current change
Still got a shot: Steve Kerr at range
No bullshit, you a victim at this current range
Wonder when I thrashed the concept that I was insane
Or that them and I was the same; block full of candles
Seen what’s-his-names turn to "what’s his name?"
Closet full of problems that’s irrelevant by every bid
Layin’ next to the skeletons in the evidence
Closet full of problems that’s irrelevant by every bid
Layin’ next to the skeletons in the evidence

[Hook]
Broken dreams lost in the night
Pieces fallin’, pick ‘em up again
If I don’t win I swear I’ll die tryin'
Die tryin'
