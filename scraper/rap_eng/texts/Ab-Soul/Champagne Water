[Intro]
I was so high, couldn't get over it
So low, couldn't get under it
So I closed my eyes, had a dream
And dreamt that I was

[Hook]
Jesus Christ, Jesus iced out in your chain
Say my name when you feel something, say it in vain
I’ll turn your water into champagne
Yeah, I’ll turn your water into champagne
Guys with the cash out, girls with the dress with the back out
Credit card maxed out, drink till we blackout
I’ll turn your water into champagne
Yeah, I’ll turn your water into champagne
Cause I know how to have a good time
Let's party like we stayed in the garden before the snake and the vine
Let's party like we just played the Garden and everyone know my name
Everyone scream my name, ya everyone scream my name Ya
They say Oh My God!
Jesus Christ

[Verse 1]
My best friend from high-school
She went to a rave
Then she scored some E, then she got real brave
Then she got knocked up from by a white boy with long hair
Ask her who the daddy is  she’ll say "I swear it’s..."

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I took a man's confession
This is what he said
I told the girl I loved her just so she'd give me some head
I know it’s wrong to lie but life’s not really fair
And I said "man, who ya tellin’? I was there."
On the nights them light skin girls stole your wallet
Called up your baby momma, told her you an alcoholic
That you spent your child support on cheap liquor and weed
Honestly, y'all both look like angels to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Aye, man, if you knew better, then you would do so
But aye, man, who are you to say what’s better, though?
Aye, man, I bet the news will never show
Aye, man, carry the crucifix on cruise control
Kept it soul up in this ho
Soulo, ho, them niggas know
47k gold, that’s without the chain on
Goddamn, why these humans so devilish?
Who the fuck Led Zeppelin?
To put the stairway to heaven in
Commune with bread and beverages from Lamb’s hemorrhaging
It’s not too much, just a little bit of everything
Aye, man, my drink pink like an Easter dress
That Jesus juice, still seek the truth like an Easter Egg
Reap what you sow, am I a demon?
Fruit biting was forbidden, like Eve in Eden
Then amen, if I’m the reason, so be it
For all my niggas with Jesus pieces that need a piece of Jesus
Singing

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
The best things I’ve ever done
People judge me for I say "fuck it", with a smile
They don’t know me, oh

Jesus Christ
Say I'm like Jesus Christ

[Outro] x2
Jesus loves me, this I know
Turns the water into the wine
Makes the green grass grow
Give me pills when I'm in pain, can't feel no more
Cause Jesus loves me

Jesus loves me
Oh my God
