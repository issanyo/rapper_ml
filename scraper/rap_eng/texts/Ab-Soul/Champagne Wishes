[Verse 1]
Truly on point, naturally [inaudible]
Creatin' history every day and my name's Ab
Dash Soul, motherfucker
'At last', [inaudible] said to James
Classic as a Cadillac record
Play me, never that, act like you know
Don' t get ransacked by the rat pack
See, I'm the black Humphrey Bogart
Puffin' Blacks though, hella smart, asshole
See, this my culinary art how I cook up such food for thought
Clear the kitchen, it's finna get real hot
Uh, MasterChef, no accountant, cashin' cheques
You niggas ain't half of half of half of my best
Uh, champagne wishes, some cream to my Swishers
A Nicki Minaj for two five-star bitches
Ladies and gentlemen
This is a look inside of the mind of the demented
And everythin' I said, I swear I meant it
Listen, fascinated by the tactics of a Jeffrey Dahmer
Eat your ass up, cannibal for the dollar, intangible
I'm at the top, ramen noodles, that's understandable
The Last Samurai here to tear a guy apart
Tie a piece of barbed wire 'round his heart
If he gassed up, he get boa constricted until he fart
If he talk and it don't correspond with his walk
He walk the plank
Captain Hook went hard, Peter was gay
You'll never, never land a spot on our roster that way
Not a Rasta, but a smoke, like, a whaler, they know
I'm servin' niggas, tip the waiter 'fore you leave the table
Goddammit, just found another crack up in my halo
Are you comprehendin'? Am I condescendin'?
Or am I kindly sendin' you a message kinda quickly?
I never get too busy to get busy
Simply stuntin', your missus can't miss me
Engine gunnin', headin' for the finish line
But not the sneaker store, I need that first place prize
The blue ribbon in the sky, I'm Stevie Wonder gettin' high
What you even speakin' for?
You're iller when mute is on, carry on
And I ain't got to talk that white to bury y'all
The truth'll set you free and me, I'm [inaudible]
Literally, no car, no jewelry
Just a brain full of buffoonery between you and me
