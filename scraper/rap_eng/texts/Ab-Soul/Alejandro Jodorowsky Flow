[Sample]
What would you give
What would you give in exchange for your soul

[Verse 1: Asaad]
Silencers on my quiet gun
The cruelest nightmares what my life's become
When I say I got bodies know I got more than one
The first time was stupid the second is the important one
Rainy days is special especially when somebody die
Brother's retaliation fueled by a mother's cry
Fuck with me, have your body covered in lye
And I be cheesing hard like I don't know why
I'm blatantly underrated, they hated and labeled crazy
North Philly baby, never turn my back on who made me
And I'm really in the field and Rooski my only mentor now
Niggas ran from me cause they couldn't calm my temper down
Niggas turned their back on me, what's up with all these fake friends?
Only created Saudi Money cause I had to make ends
It only hurts if you caused it and that's the sad part
Parkside mark berry, scary in the dark, what?

[Hook: Asaad]
(What would you give?
What would you give?
In exchange for your soul?)
This that Alejandro Jodorowsky flow
Two accidents in a year, and I survived them though
This that my best man died and I revived him flow
Young God god body move your body flow

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
The black rose that rose out of the asphalt
Probably find a filet mignon in my trash talk
I'm fronting on the black blocks with the black Glock
I never let the mac pop like a laptop
Or lipstick, asshole, dipshit
Cold-hearted, mami move her body on my big stick
Religious rhetoric, spiritual innuendos
Monetary monster, money blowing in the wind though
Peaking out my mentor window, indo burning strong
Circa 1987 Keisha birth a don
Jesus Christ I'm such a pompous pilot
Catch you in the cross-heirs then wash my hands in silence
I still think about prospect from time to time
A lot of my guys did time, I won't cry to God this time
Just take it with a grain of salt like a Margarita
Alien homo sapien, it's nice to meet ya

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
(What would you give?
What would you give?
In exchange for your soul?)
This that Alejandro Jodorowsky flow
Caught that virus when I was ten, but I survived it though
This the love of my life died, I'm still riding though
Young God god body move your body flow
