[Intro/Hook]
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario (x2)

[SchoolBoy Q]
Crept up in this muthafucka soundin like a stun gun
Fresh up out the hotbox got me smellin' like marijuana
Flyer than a Desert Eagle when it’s starin’ down lookin’ at my people
Shootin muthafuckas down just because I’m evil
Live and direct like Cable TV pay-per view pay me
Who Q? Ha-chu yeah blessed it, beautifulest tune
You’ll tune on the record
Everything is coke so I kick like Liu Kang
Thinkin you can really get with this man you playin
Get you a platoon, yeah floatin’ like balloons
Get so high got to space then I shitted on the moon
Went into a rage now the sun won’t shade Mars
Know I got bars so I’m aimin for the stars
Everyone applaud, praise to the genius
Never would like to let the hoes bow to the penis
Feenish

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick relentless in other words a dentist
I’m in they mouth without a doubt
It’s funky grab an incent
Grab a honkey, grab a nigga, grab a wetback, grab a chink
Then put ‘em in a box like Michael and Leon Spinks
Then tell me what you get for cultures feeling me
As if they was blind and braille on my sleeve
Peace, to hip-hop, down to earth
Word to the voice of Chris Rock
Can I rock like a '88 Camaro and T-Top
Whoa, the scenario seem to flip like an aerial
As I dip like a pull-up bar at the gym
Won’t you witness the gem
I’m a troop from Angola and
You a cop on patrol that’s trying to Axel Foley
As dumb as Napoleon Dynamite and I’m quick to blow up then BOOM
Combustible like flames and petroleum

[Jay Rock]
It’s Jay Rock
Niggas know my status
Flip flows like a gymnast on a apparatus
Leave yo body in pain if I hit you with this ‘matic
Don’t even speak if you ain’t talkin cabbage
Loyal to the cash, thinkin’ ‘bout a marriage
Committed to the block that’s somethin’ niggas cherish
Hmm.. if you dissin’, you missing Parish
Then I’m on a mission, fishin Paris
Lookin’ at some dimes, go get your cameras
Black Hippy emcees and we got hammers
Gang member slash rap nigga
The name’s Rock, all the hoes call me that nigga
Never relax, never do that
Soon as you relax, them lames is stealin’ ya swag
I’m the truth in the booth I’m killin’ the track
To the point of no return no bringin’ It back
I’m so fluent on the beat just spittin’ the facts
You lames lyin, think you chief
You bridgin’ the gap
I’m the fountain of youth, you niggas is tap
Like bugs in the phone, you niggas is wack

[Ab-Soul]
Enter the mind of the utmost divine
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Twilight zone, war with the star
Hans Soulo
Top Dawg, not Todo, notch logo
On my hand, knock you out
Goddamn!
Say I’m not lethal, inhumane
Squeeze juice out a beetle
Offended John Lennon come to cloud 9
That’s where the cockpit is
Me and Kendrick Lamar startling all contenders
ScHoolboy Q, gangsta with a USC student IQ
And Jay Rock a fuckin’ fool
You make the wrong fuckin move
He like “DON’T FUCKIN’ MOVE!”
Aimin’ at you with the tool
I’m like what am I to do?
Crazy how the shit we make come out phenomenal
Black Hippy, and as for me I’m the black sheep passin’ weed
To Miss Bo-Peep
Peep!
Soul!
