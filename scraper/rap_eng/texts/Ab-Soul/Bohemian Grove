[Intro]
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
That's right

[Verse 1]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you, I'm just livin' how I'm livin'
Patron with a lemon, pineapple in the Ciroc
Vanity, more homes than Sherlock family to roll through
Smoke up, fuck with a broad or two
I'm broader than you
(Murda!) I'm slaughterin' you
She ain't gotta be a genius to see it
I just hope the brain make me say: Jesus! (Christ)
No religion, I'm just so explicit
I coexist in places you would never know existed
(What, what?) Soulo here
Take a photo like a 4-seater
Top notch to my fuckin' socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, that's reasonable
If she pop a Xanny, and give me the panties

[Hook]
She'll never leave me alone
Shit, I swear I just met shorty like 40 minutes ago
And it's a go, man, I hope she don't think I think she a ho
Got me harder than sneakin' a bitch in Bohemian Grove
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches, the bitches

[Verse 2]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you, I'm just livin' how I'm livin'
Hennesey and Coke, 1800
We mixin' dark and light like the 1800's
And we gettin' blunted, what it do? Yes, indeed
Bet I got some weed like Schoolboy Q (Q!)
Let the festivities begin, we in here
(What?) we in here (what?) we in here
Where them hoes at? I'm sincere as Nasir
Belly of the beast, I might feast on my dear
We night ride like Paul Revere
Spillin' Mai Tais all on her brassiere
Top notch to my fuckin' socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, put the key in the door
If she pop a Percocet and give me the sex

[Hook]
She'll never leave me alone
Shit, I swear I just met shorty like 40 minutes ago
And it's a go, man, I hope she don't think I think she a ho
Got me harder than sneakin' a bitch in Bohemian Grove
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches, the bitches

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Hey baby, I been thinking of you
Hey baby, I been thinking of you
Hey baby, I been thinking of you
Hey baby, I been thinking of you
Look at my mind, floating away
I get so illuminated

Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system!
Motherfuck you, I'm just livin' how I'm livin'

[Interlude]

Control, Control, Control
Stimulate the hoes
Control
Educating my niggas
Control, Control

[Outro]
Now, having said that, I'll go back to this document. This was a meeting, okay this was what he said:
“Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register, or suffer being unable to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.

Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption, and we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.”
