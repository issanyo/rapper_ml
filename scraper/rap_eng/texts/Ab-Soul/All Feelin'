[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, my life is like a movie
I’m broke, but almost famous
Meanin the bitches holla, and them niggas be hatin
But all I got is a dolla for the dolla...menu at McDonald's
Fucked up I know this
Its why I get fucked up
Tryna let shit go, like it was stuck
I thank god for the flow, niggas say I’m so real
It it wasn’t for Hip-Hop I’d hang myself with a rope
That’s just how I feel

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Look, my life is like a movie
I'mma keep it real
I came up on Power Rangers and oatmeal
Then it was BET and Internet
Then it was white Adidas and cigarettes
Then it was black and milds and blasphemy
Then it was weed and women’s physical anatomy
Now I dabble in em all
My life style is ill, think I’m wrong?
Fuck you with a condom on
That’s just how I feel

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Listen, my life is like a movie
I guess that means I’m acting
I’m the lion in the zoo; main attraction
It's my time to kill Samuel L Jackson
Easy as ABC, coulda been the 6th Jackson
Ab-Soul the epitome of talent
All started with a mechanical pencil and this yellow tablet
Put my mind to it
Like enemy turf I rhyme light
K Dot on the Ecstasy pill, that’s why I’m nice
That’s just how I feel
