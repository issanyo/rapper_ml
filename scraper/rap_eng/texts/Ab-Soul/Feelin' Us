[Intro]
6:19 in the morning, nigga

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Let me start off with this statement, I'm the mothafuckin greatest
I ain't even have too many haters, all my niggas knew I was gon' make it
From performing at pep rallys, showcases, talent shows
That I had to sell tickets for, just to get up in that ho
Now raise your hand say Soulo ho, raise your hand say Soulo ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo ho, raise your hand say Soulo ho!
I'm rolling up in the tour bus, just rolling up in the tour bus
Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia
But I'm finna continue, pass the fire to my nigga Tone
Couldn't find a fire but this far from home
But we still trying, I mean we still chiefing
She thinks it's cool, she took a puff, she still freaking
I popped a bean, fell asleep, woke up, and started thinking

[Hook: Ab-Soul & RaVaughn]
Man this shit pays hanging in the House of Pain
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Cause they feeling us, they feeling us, they feeling us
Are you feeling us?
They feeling us, they feeling us, they feeling us
Are you feeling us?
Cause everywhere I go, man I swear they know my name
Make your girlfriend cry when she see me walk by
Cause they feeling us, they feeling us, they feeling us

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Yeah I'm liquored up, this a celebration
TDE the shit, thanks to all you haters!
I'm Jay Rock, yeah the OG, me and Soulo blowing OG
Hit the stage, then beat the case, then get the cake, then burn trees
Shake hands, kiss babies, show love, throw 3s
I was on the block with a quarter key, like what the fuck is a 16?
I was so anti-social, nigga wasn't outspoken
Till I picked up a mic, story of my life!
Uh, came with the piece so keep the peace
Uh, I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't sweating no vendetta, champagne on my breath in the hotel lobby
You feel me? Damn right you feel me!
Got them sigh she feel me and the paparazzi film me, feel me?

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I'm feeling fine and dandy, staying awake off this Xanny
Noddin' off this weed can one of y'all find another Backwood please?
I just know that I can be, an example of what you can be
Making a way for my homies, making it easy for my family
So mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
No mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
Told me I'm smarter than you, you just gotta trust me yo
I stole from the record store, still selling, records though, yeah
(Love you Grandma!) Ain't no shame in my game
They know my name in Montreal, they sing my songs
Cause they relate, they feelin us, cause we can't be touched
Thank God for Top and Punch, ho-ho-hold on, drop the drums

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
These bitches love Soulo, Del Amo to Soho
Fucking with them Top Dawgs, you'll just look like Toto
Do it all for Soulo, I don't even know them
Hol' Up here we go again, Justin bring the chorus in!

[Hook: Ab-Soul & RaVaughn]
