Lyrics: verse 1: Larry Murvin
I feel like I am next... yep
I feel like i can be the best... yep
I feel it all in my chest... yep
When i touch the mic i become crest... yep
My mic skills make a man strees
Even if you dont believe me you can put me to the test
I ain't all about the money but i do want respect
I do got alot of muscles but i dont flex
Im all about the peace nothing more or less
Im a modern- day Malcom X with a Tec
Even if you dont believe it you are blessed
Get them demonds off your back dont be stressed
God doesnt disciminate or go against
Even if your job on the regular is having sex
Even if your job is selling Rocks to little kids
All you got to do is get on your knees and repent
Thats what i do when i touch the pen
But, even if you feel like the devils going to win
And your body is filled with satans Sins
Times not a factor your not a minute men but your still...



[Hook: ScHoolBoy Q]
Stay, blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga (X2)


Verse 2( Larry Murvin)

A true story about a friend... wait
I promise i will never tell again... wait
If your stressed never think of this again... wait
Even if your filled with hate... Make
All your oppertunities dont wait
Suicide was on his brain
Anonymous i will never say your name
In his mind he was really going insane
You tried to suficate yourself like Bane
Living in a world with so much pain
People geting on your nerves, when life give you curves you dont keep driving you break
Never went to church, instead dived in lakes
My mistake, Metaphorically sex all day
A sinful life is not that great
In life we all make mistakes
If your stressed more or less
God put you to this test
Stay yourself, keeep your head up, good luck
Cause your still



[Hook: ScHoolBoy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga


[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere
And I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everwhere
But I'mma always be right her
