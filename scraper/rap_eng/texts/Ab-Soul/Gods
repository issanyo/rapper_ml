[Intro: Jaye]
East side, east side, east side
Til I die, 'til I die
Yeah, fly mob shit, nigga
Fly motherfuckers get with it, nigga

[Verse 1: Jaye]
I got noodles on the stove, fridge full of O's
I pour the champagne and give myself a toast
Yes I mean to boast, swag I hold the most
I hang around with goons, I got a closet full of gold
Rep that ET straight east side, where we let that beef ride
Fuck around and get deep fried, Givenchy rag in my Levis
Been fly since knee-high, your bitch was stolen by the new guy
Smokin' weed got borin' and man, I'm lookin' to find some new high
Baby girl, give me two sides, super-size with those leg and thighs
Get in that pussy and improvise, I get it wet then I go inside
Best believe I gotta shine, best believe I go for mine
Super-villain, Megamind, you just a eight and I need a dime
Long paper, short gangster that's semi-9 fit me fine
Hit a nigga like twenty times, you try to run, hit you from behind
Fuck niggas better stay in line, gettin' paid off fuckin' crime
Take a look at how a boss ride, Scarface, the world is mine

[Hook: Jaye]
All I do is stack, I don't fuck with you niggas
All I want is these bitches, all I want is these riches (Money)
All I want is this money, all I want is these bitches
Pop beans when I lean, it's like it's all a dream
We like Gods
(Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
We like Gods
I can't die, my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby)
We like Gods
(Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
We like Gods
I can’t die, my Boo-Boo’s bout to have my baby)
We like Gods

[Verse 2: Jaye]
Strapped up like I'm Rambo, swaggin' out in my camos
Makin' niggas examples, I thought I told you go HAM ho
My Sprite dirty, I sip it slow, bitch bad she dip it low
She do what I say cause I get the dough
But fuck that bitch, I'm tryin' to get me mo'
The fuck you think that I'm in it for?
I done came up in a Benz
Bad bitch and her friends
All this money I fuckin' spend
I can't do nothin' but fuckin' win
Here I go again tryin' not to sin (Sorry)
Fuck it, orange juice lots of gin
Shit fuck it, okay, I'm drunk
Man these bitches better swallow dick
Hollow tips on these pussy niggas
They not real, they counterfeit
Bad bitches make my dick bigger
Niggas mad, niggas mad, they don't fuck with that little nigga
Wouldn't have it any other way
Fuck anything that them niggas say
Fuck them niggas, boy, get your pay
Hustle hard like every day
That bad bitch, I turned her out, she so in love what a nigga 'bout
I ain't tryin' to fuck, I just want her mouth
Sippin' lean like I'm in the south
But this shit in the Midwest
Praise the lord to my last breath

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, new God flow
Imagine Kanye West pushin' a ton
Yayo in my vocals
I'm flippin' the bird and flippin' the tongue
Middle fingers up to the Po-po
Still no love to these hoes though
All I want is these bitches (Soul-o)
All I want is these riches (Soul-o)
Bird crumbs to you pigeons
I'm gettin' high in the lo-lo
Gettin' head while I drive, but, I don't even drive yo
Make a right at that light
Pop a bean, I just might
Bag your bitch, I just did
She said she seen me on VEVO
Easy call, west side
We keep the peace and pull straps out
You in the back, I lead the pack
You either pack or get packed out
I eat the track, I send it back and deposit checks and pull cash out
You blowin' cot, I'm blowin' pot, I'm throwin' rocks at your glass house
Fuck you think I do it for?
I done came up, fifty grand in like fifty days, Goddamn
I wrote this shit faded in Amsterdam
Jesus pieces ain't enough
Chop that lamb and paint it blood
Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep

[Hook]
