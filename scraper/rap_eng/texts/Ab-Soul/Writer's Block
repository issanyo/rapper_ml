[Verse]
(stone cold)
Stone cold, killa soul, back, with a iller flow
Packed, like a sack lunch with a rap that'll detach ya like Velcro
Spit a sixteen then hell rose
(talkin' out ya ass)
I bend a nigga like a elbow, for talkin' out his ass
But I don't hear shit less he talkin' bout this cash
Flip em like an hour glass now that's dirty shower fast nigga
(The game)
I got the game mad, like star face throwin' a tantrum
Seed to the root of all evil deeds, don't plant em'
Ab the miraculous to rap what math is to calculus
(Big figures)
Look out for dis' no other nigga figure, could amount to this
I'm bigger than jigga's home boy from the sty
And I dont dot em I just got shades over my eyes.....SOUL
(the gift)
Lord knows I got the gift
Why you lookin' surprised swallow your pride
Before you choke and need the Heimlich Maneuver
You a threat? I'm Nortan anti-virus Ima remove ya bet
(Top dog entertainment)
It's Top Dawg Entertainment, fuck y'all pups
I tell my bitches let ya hair down, leave on your pumps
My doors always open, you can leave when you want, yup!
(Top notch)
Top notch to my socks, and my shoes fit perfectly
Start me out I'm finna start shitting on niggas purposely
Call me out like an umpire and ima fire
(fucked up)
Like when an employers budget is cut
As long as y'all ridin' my dick I'm fuckin' you up
No gay shit back to the basics fat laces in my ACIX
(Slavery)
Got it mastered like a plantation owner back in the 1800's
You niggas love it you starvin' I'm grubbin
Open the oven and have a bite that's equivalent to how I write
(Food for thought)
Its food for thought for your appetite
Hand me a compass, nigga I'm lost in this afterlife if I'm readin' these chapters right
Was heaven bound, but hell, that ain't happen right
(Black hoodie)
Oh well, I make the best of what I got when it's hot
Black hoodie on attractin' more heat than a spot
Wit crack rock by the zip don't let your kanine sniff
And be surprised when he go stiff, im poppin like a 4 5th
In yo function humpin yo bitch, she come home fussin
Thats cold, it must be december or sumfin, she slipped and fell on my dick and I ain't yell timber or nuffin, shit
(Writers block)
This what I come up with when I got writers block
Win by any means necessary tie a knot, A-round ya voice box
A B, soul heat stroke any man come across this line, finito
I wipe my feet on ya CD cover like welcome matts
Bien venido, how bout that
Got my hand on my GAT no im lyin thats my testicle
And its growin like vegeteble
Get off my groin homosexuals I tell you niggas time and time again
Perpetual, liars on the mic get fried like rice & wontons in hong kong
