[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Do you really want a test, you better study real hard before you end up with an F
Be my guest, soul's what every soul wants to be I guess
I'm with the B-I pardon me I be a phenom
Heard you was a fag in L.A. like FILA
Whatever happened to the U-N-I-T-Y?
Like Queen Latifa see you steam
As a little teapot (How so?) short but not too stout
Ya cloud fabricate what you 'bout
I'm bout done fuckin' wit' you small time MC's
Nigga I'm competin' wit' Pun
Run up and get done up like a prom hair-do
Top floor still on the come up, where are you?
It's one million ways to die I'm livin' proof
Matter fact let me rephrase that (Try me)

[Hook]
Actions speak louder than words!
Actions, actions speak louder than words!
Actions speak louder than words!
Actions, actions speak louder than words!

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Committed to my cash, loyal to my projects
But AR knock off a nigga bicep
I'm a go getter, I'm a gorilla
Nigga im the shit, shit on shitters I'm realer
I'm so exquisite, bitches they love to visit
Fuck'em and Send them home with their fucking thongs missing
I'm what the game missing that why them rappers hatin'
Next nigga who try me Imma leave his head vacant (blah)
Goon to the death, thanks to my habitat
See before you speak you better watch who you yappin' at
And if you speak then be sure I'll  be clappin' at
One shot, one kill no clappin' back
I'm in the streets, I hear you niggas talkin'
Claimin they killers and that ain't even in they hearts
They something like ink on a piece of paper,  marks
Im something like a razor blade, sharp

[Hook]
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Wanna compete with this technique big gun take a seat
I can blaze for days but me, rather take a freak
Touch socks in the suite, big name in the streets
Top Dawg ENT, GED, TNT
40 Glock pop shit, bust into the Glock click
Semi-automatic lips spit when the pin itch
Tighter than a closed fist
Product make your nose twitch
All that bullshit have you buried where my dog piss
Tortoise speedin' through the game like cautious
Fortress, thousand dollar frames like our porches
Cautious, clock it and explode the track your brain
Over wax it, solved over rap
Shots breathe, got power tell the cops freeze
Countin' all this bread, Aftermath not eve
Big league I'm the best my spot's earned
You niggas disagree? (try me)

[Hook]
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words

[Verse 4:Kendrick Lamar]
Anybody can get it
Send 'em in a cloud if you think sky's the limit
Im foul like a elbow intended
In the game no winning even if it is a scrimmage
You can get coached right now
Black Phil Jackson maxin'
Cooler than George Bush when the planes went down
As far as rappin', I should be a wordsmith plus GT
Swerve like cursive (beep beep)
Y'all wait on Wayne to drop C3
I drop C4 Bomb on 'em (I mean war)
No white flag put 'em in a full body cast
Like a sitcom I make 'em sit calm I sip Dom P, bumpin' the Isely
With a bitch on my wee wee like I been in France to long
Need another level been advanced too long
Niggas want war come on

[Hook]
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words

[Verse 5: Punch]
Ugh
This nigga tryin' to meet the architect
You going about this thing the wrong way that kinda far fetched (kinda far fetched)
What's the reason for this nonsense?
You listen to your boys, you should have reasoned with your conscience (naw)
You wasn't built for this content I send a chick at you that dabble in bondage
Tie you to the bed post as you respond in kindness
Even let her blindfold you, you love how she dominate
My Spanish chick from Brooklyn bed sty
Was specialized in givin' Brazilian Neckties
While I sip a Maitai cause my time is far more important than to be shootin' it out with tough guys
And I still flow like faucet water
My niggas half step like foster daughters
My mic can slaughter a nation like the angel of god
You thing this lyrical homicide nigga

[Hook]
Actions speak louder than words
Actions, actions speak louder than words
