[Verse 1: Retchy P]
Yo I done had 20 racks and blew it all to the ground
I sold nickle bags and peddled the pounds
Can't even talk drugs and bitches in my city
Without saying my name
Snotty nose used to pitch in the rain
Now my bitch play with my dick in the Range
She start beef and I'm just catching a flight
It's probably drugs if I'm sipping the Sprite
You know my life
Drink, smoke, roll some dice
Shoot the club up on open night
Hit a bitch in a wig, tall nigga got caught on the leg
I hit the sherm and go dumb at the feds
I'm on your block, come kill me
The purpose always doing me filthy
Ruin lives and I ain't never felt guilty, nigga walk with me
A couple racks at the sound of a chirp
I'm smoking dope while I'm baggin' the work
Had the building at the top of the staircase
I'm probably getting top in the staircase
Fiends take a bump and can't stand straight
Yea, I'm a firm believer in god
But it get cloudy you when the times gettin' hard
It make a nigga wanna get up and rob
Wasn't for me a lot of niggas will starve
They needed work so i give 'em a job
Feed your peoples nigga
A lot of niggas don't share them views
So the TV gotta share that news
You know the streets in these made up rules
Cause niggas ain't pay them dues
They show a tarp and some beat up shoes
Shit is wicked, and most of these niggas is duck
Plus keep it tucked or you pressing your luck
You know the peeps get to searching the truck
They smell weed, now they bringin' the dogs
Run up your name thirst to give you a charge

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
The only thing better than sex is when the words connect
I'm a pisces with a chicken fishnets, difficult to catch
It's pivotal to know that Soul don't play round'
You got wordplay, i got word playgrounds
I make sounds do tricks and flips
I had a tech deck before we needed a tec on deck
We never can be neck to neck, the naked truth is you suck
I'm just worried but who imma get the neck from next
Next level reason and rhyme, one word at the time
The versatile flow , .... You know
You at the Podium, we throwin' tomatoes at your show
Ayo, is a tomatoe a fruit or a vegetable , I don't know
But I beat up every beat i put my heart to
And I made it all of making cartoons
I'm only getting started , the flow is so retarded
I could get away with murder fingerprints up on the burner
No I ain't got no wallet but ....
Running through them racks and we shot for the designer
Last year the first year a nigga ever paid taxes
In Manhattan with a model catchin' all my taxes
Hold up, wait a minute; y'all thought i was finished
I been chasin' dreams since a nigga was an infant
Now we really in it, 50 for the ticket
10k for the feature, but only if you illy
Top Dawg Entertainment, slap your momma silly
Life is like a cycle, I'm about to pop a willie
I'm just tryin eat, I hope the Lord forgive me
'Coz the root of all evil is what keeps my world spinnin'
So pay me what you owe, not a penny short
'Coz there is only one, no two cents ain't important
