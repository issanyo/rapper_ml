[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm finished soul searchin'
I feel like I know my sole purpose
Colder than a winter solstice
You're a dope dealer if you sold this
Yo, Soul everywhere if you ain't notice
Solar power, solar system, told you so
If you was a compartment in your car, you couldn't console
Known to consolidate hoping those listening
Nothing but facts in tracks I'm soliciting
Soul train, soul plane, those are no brainers
Sole so thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day in a half in these eight and a halves
Are solidified; why I'm the greatest to rap
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go, Soul gon' shine
So everybody knows, like Beyonce and Solange
What the fuck is Soul on?
We really out here but we ain't at the salon.
A pair of per soles that cost like fo'
Kid from Del Amo with a flow that's so universal
Soul
