[Intro]
"This Northwood, this is where I slumber at. You know what I'm saying?"

I got my mind on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush.... Rush

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I was on Avalon, in a Avalon
With the window down, two notche for TV on
Yeah, that’s what he be on
California sunshine, heater on
I laid the text but sometimes niggas read it wrong
Still a slave to the page, no beeper on
If the sky tell lies then let me lie (where?)
In the same home that the reaper own
Fire, feel the degrees rising in this song
Keep the degree pollutin' your speakers till I’m gone
Became a tree, mama your seed is growin'
Niggas see me, see where I’m going
Uphill, and I keep going
Through the red lights, through the roadblocks
My headlights blind the opposition
Ain’t got 200 on the dash but I’m doing half

[Hook]

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street I’m always in a rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
I’m always in a rush

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Rolling down central, in a bucket but I’m feeling presidential
Breaking down swisha’s, filling 'em with indo
Ho’s trying to date a nigga like info's
I’m flying right by 'em like holla back
Hoping they won’t see me through the tinted windows
Bending corners like I ain’t got a bookmark
Ain’t got the most paper but I’m booksmart
I’m speeding through life like fuck it all (My nigga)
I got my word and my fuckings balls (My nigga)
And that’s my word I’m a fucking ball (My nigga)
Control the earth so I can have a ball (My nigga)
I’m moving at a fast pace and I ain’t slowing up for Nathan
Paparazzi follow me but they can’t keep up the tape
You ain’t talking longterm and you ain’t talking my language
Don’t trip, we still popping like a stainless
Fo' real

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street I’m always in a rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
I’m always in a rush

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Del Amo, Del Amo
Eyes on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush.... Rush
