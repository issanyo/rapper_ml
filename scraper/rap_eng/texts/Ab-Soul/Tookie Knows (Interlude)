[Intro]
Everybody get low, get low!
Head shots, head shots, head SHOTS!
YAWK! (How you want it?)

[Bridge]
Sniff it, then I inhale it, fickle me blowing powder
Sprinkle me, inhale it, sniff it, head bobbing
Sprinkle me, inhale it, sniff it, head bobbing
Sprinkle me, inhale it, lift it, head bobbing

[Outro]
Giving away toe tags, toe tags, toe tag
One tag, two tag, three tag, four tag, YAWK!
(Where's the mothafuckin' money, my nigga?)
TOOKIE KNOW!
