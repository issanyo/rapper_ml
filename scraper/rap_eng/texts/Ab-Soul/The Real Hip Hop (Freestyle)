[Verse 1: Ab Soul]
Did you meet Rock from Cali to Italy?
It'd be like something you've never seen, literally
Soul brother, this rap shit is like a cult
But I don't give a shit, I'll wear it like a coat
You know, I'm so hip hop I love it to death
From a DJ Scratch to graffiti on yo set
B boys that could spin on they head, you know the best
I had the karaoke machine, recording cassettes
Fill up my cup like support for breasts
I reflect back like when niggas used to flow for respect
But its all marketing now, if you ain't got a gimmick
Know what’s his name, or you ain’t got an image
Probably won't last a minute
Then you wonder why these old-heads, wonder whats happening with it
Back in the day, when a album came out, yo you had to get it
Prior to iTunes my room full of LP's
Like a Ma and Pa shop
All thanks to my mom's pawn shop
Boppin' on it since birth
And I'm all in on hot
More cuts than a club sandwich
Here to cause all you industry thugs damage
Live from the 310, and we wan't more
Like eeeny miney, serve anybody
Hand me they keys, I'm only trying to unlock my dreams but
Ha ye Ab Soul
