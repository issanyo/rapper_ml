[Hook]
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what you're saying
Go on with all that hate
So it's fuck you, pay me, I said
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what you're saying
Go on with all that hate
So it's fuck you, pay me

[Verse 1]
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
You a tattoo to a statue
Run a mic like Michelangelo draw, too
While I turn this bitch into Saw II
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
And you down there on that totem pole
I'm on the road and I'll fuck your girl
And I'll put this dick up in a whirl
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
And you down there like a little nigga
I'll buy you up on that rent card
You still around? You better thank God
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
I ain't worry what's down there
I'll take a step, look on my shoe
And you'll be splattered everywhere
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what none of y'all talking 'bout
I'm on top of my mountain
And y'all just started climbing rocks step
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what you're saying
Go on with all that hate
So it's fuck you, pay me
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Don't care what down there doing
Cause up here, up here, down there, down there
And you don't moving how I'm moving

[Hook]
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what you're saying
Go on with all that hate
So it's fuck you, pay me, I said
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Can't hear what you're saying
Go on with all that hate
So it's fuck you, pay me

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Come on girl, is you down?
You with it? I'm with it
Go on 'head, go down, uh
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Puffing pot on a mountain top
Dipping in that bag
White girl on my countertop (Soulo)
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Drop it like it's hot, ho
I ain't move no birds, but
She in love with my cock, though
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Looking down on you little niggas
Got a 16 with a seal on it
Shot glass with a pill in it
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Y'all all under my telescope
So much that I'm squinting
You ain't snitching, but you can tell I'm dope
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Hah, can't hear what you saying
Smoking on that strong, strong
Like a Super Saiyan, saying
(Bitch, I'm way up here)
Soulo, yeah, HiiiPower, Top Dawg
All dogs go to heaven, not y'all
