[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah mane, you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song, man, like a damn... rapper. Oh man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt & Mac Miller]
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow, I been drownin' again

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman while that cape was off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain did his last number, mothafucka

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's
He got a lil Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now?
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down
Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street
Yellin' "play my shit or wake the baby up!‚Äù
I get her faded, put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always called my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war unknown
Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of the glory hole (Woah)
Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat
Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road
Look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics
Hate myself up to strangers
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies
This could be my last breath, I'ma take my time
Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standing in the shallow soul
You are speaking with the shallow soul
Shallow soul
I've been drowning with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
