Pt. I: Portishead in the Morning

[Broadcast]
Reporting live from the...
February 23rd 1987: “Quintessential” supernova burst on the scene. Light from the brightest supernova of the 20th century reaches Earth from 168,000 light-years away. At the University of Toronto's observatory in the foothills of the Andes mountains, 30-year-old astronomer Ian Shelton was looking at photographic plates in the wee hours of February 24, while listening to Pink Floyd‘s The Wall

[Chorus]
I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me, make me take my light back

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Demigod with a record deal
Everything's puny to me, you a newbie
I'm from Nibiru, microphone check one, two, three
Master of ceremony no matter the territory, I'm cozy
Oz. of OG, my brain playin' Ring Around the Rosy
The fried egg in my head defies science
I'm Bill Nye, goin' to great heights to stay the highest
Call me Soulo ho the Prophet
But do you really comprehend it? (No!)
Is it prophet meaning messenger
Or profit meaning expenses?
Pick it… ah, forget it!

[Chorus]
I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me, make me take my light back

[Interlude]
See, right here, right? We need that chick from, uh
You know that chick from Portishead
“When he walked outside the observatory”
I'm the brightest silver lining
And none of y'all don't feel this shit?

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
The philosopher gettin' stoned
It's no doubt in my mind I found the philosopher's stone
Thought these were just songs that I write? You're wrong
Move my mouth and move a mountain with ease as well
Dead ass, I'ma live forever like the HeLa cell
My nigga Hatchet said: “Ab, you a genius, but you gotta go stupid
Sometimes in order to win, you gotta lose it”
My goal was to hip the hitters to glitches in the system
Do we really want to go to Heaven?
Ain't no bitches mentioned (This is a man's world!)
And I ain't-a sexist, I enlighten sisters too
And, oh yes, it's Bohemian Grove baby, not groove
One time for the women
Two times for the bitches
I'm from another galaxy, I'm actually an android
Look me up on your Galaxy's and your Android's
The Devil was created, he is not a creator
And energy can neither be created or destroyed
It's YMF, nigga, YMF, nigga!
If I ain't the Messiah, I'm a mess, nigga
YMF, nigga! YMF, nigga!
If I ain't the Messiah…

[Chorus]
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me make, me take my light back

That spot did turn out to be supernova 1987A. When he walked outside the observatory, the object was visible to the naked eye. The plates covered an area near the Large Magellanic Cloud, when he spotted an exceptionally bright spot

Pt. II: HER World

[Chorus]
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands

[Verse]
Aye, man, there's more than one reason why there is only one
Remember that first or end before you've begun
I rhyme like I'm God's only begotten son
She so loved the world she gave Soul the world
That's why I just have fun
And use my third eye like I just had one
God gotta be a thot, the blood from your erection
Come from your brain and your feet
So you can't think and you can't run
