[Verse 1: Ab Soul]

Yo, y'all listening?
Ya'll ready?
Check
I feel like I finished soul searching
I feel like I know my soul purpose
Colder than a winter solstice, you're a dope dealer if you sold this, yo
Soul everywhere if you didn't notice
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't console
Known to consolidate hope in those listening
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm soliciting
Soul train, soul plane those are no brainers
Sole so thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day in a half in these eight and a halves
A solidified why I'm the greatest to rap
Yo, yo, Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
I left America with a bottle of slow blow
So everywhere Soul go, Soul gone shine
Everybody knows like Beyonce and Solange
What the fuck is Solange?
We really out here but we ain't [?] Soul line
A pair of [?] cost like four
Kid from Del-Amo, with a flow that is so universal
Soul
