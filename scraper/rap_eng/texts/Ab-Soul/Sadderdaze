[Hook]
Lost in this world still looking for myself
Ain't looking for no help, nor a book upon to shelf
I got no one to tell so I might as rebel
Fuck it I'll go to hell, it beats being in the jail
Lost in this world still looking for myself
Ain't looking for no help, nor a book upon to shelf
I got no one to tell so I might as rebel
Fuck it I'll go to hell, it beats being in the jail

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Nothing but jewels, when I shine they said it'혲s the Don
Rastaman, rest or rant in the restaurant
All events get sabotaged when we packing bomb
Overpopulate or, take up space then we blasting off
Don't try to censor the message you send sir
Money what I hope these hoes know they won't get a cent of and
Since the placenta, that what they loved the scent of
Father figures were brokers buying time shares rather than to tryna spend some
I need a cleansing just to cleanse sins
My pros been killing shit, know that and peep the forensics
Private eye investigaters see that my f-riends sick
Been thankful for my blessings while I'm strengthing my senses
Felt detached like my tendons wasn't in attendance
Ascending past the Andes until I know when the end is
I chose not to epitomize, written lines, people criticize cause they critter size
Feel incline there's at hand, I could bring to light
King revive, living life get honor as of night
I know I'm close, but no I won'혲t be overthrown
You'd swear nobody know em, while he was smaller than a gnome
Frequent flyer spittin' even the higher-ups know that I've flown
Few bucks short to cop a water, found ten then I overflow
Line for line, blow for blow, no one knows as I overdose

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Heaven knows that we're living in hell
But I cherish every day that we live and inhale
Toxins of this boxed in
Earth I dwell, yeah earths a sphere
But this the shit every single person on earth should fear
The competition is copping out
Cause I ain't move keys but have the keys to lock 'em out
I'혲m rolling up my sleeves like I'혲m about to knock 'em out
Just to show the tricks I've been holding this whole event
You enterprising, though, and I like it, it's coo
With the top dawgs yo, I gotta bite ya, let's go
Soulo, hola, soular system, I'm spinning on my finger tips
See I'm as real as it gets, I'm realer than this
Wave of consciousness across the seven continents
Drawing the law of oppsites
On the noggin of novices
Hold the... cropping out their accomplishments
On Instagram who gives a damn how many likes you get?
I'm likely to flip, like gymnastics
Ima tell you I'm the illest till you get sick
Sometime the villain wins in the end, but that's how it is though
I find it real weird that Zimmerman get to live
Oh well, crack a seal peel a wood for the greater good
And don't be stingy with it, share it with your friend
Cause both of y'all could be gone tomorrow just like (snap) ...think about it, nigga
