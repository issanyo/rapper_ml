Because it's 1-8-7 on a under cover cop
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco? (Gotta be made)
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Because it's 1-8-7 on a under cover cop
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco? (Gotta be made)
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
He wore a leather coat, Cazal shades
A gold pinky ring, I mean he's got to be paid
Or maybe he's a mobster, probably made
Except I never seen him around, ought to complain
But I got the kids info, heard he was a jeweler
From up up the block I thought of my friend Mueller
That would be our introduction
Call it an ice breaker
I brought him a broken watch just to start a conversation
Who am I
Ugh, Young Lefty my name
But I need not explain
Bled blocks with cain
Over 20 something bodies I'm trying to get out the game
So I ain't got a problem with poppin' one in your brain
Kapeesh
Ride with me but under one condition
Over stand a position this is grown man business
Listen
I can take you under my wing
Or I can take your lights out and let this Desert Eagle sing
Because it's

[Verse 2: One-2]
Aye Yo, my cousin introduced me to his homie
Who told me about some money making schemes he gone show me
G's he gone grow me
To help me get started, I thought it seemed like bologna
Thought he was a phony
But then, a couple of weeks past
He calls me on the cell-y and tells me to meet fast
Brought a brief case with a couple of G's cash
Talked it over with Fash
And gave him the G-pass
He knew all about the spots that we smashed
The robberies, The jewelry, guns, the weed stash
It's usually easy for me to smell a pretender
At the family meetings he's a regular member
Deep in our circle, but I follow my intuition
And tried to warn the bosses, they thought that I was trippin'
Told the guard to pat him down, I fear he's a liar
I put one in his dome, caught him wearing a wire
