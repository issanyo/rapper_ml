[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I recall it like it was yesterday, though it's so blurry
No worries, I was never in no hurry, the time ticks
I'm just a little dude in middle school
Tryna be hard with my little crew, I was pitiful
On a soul search with little to no worth
Grades suck cause I never did my homework
I was no jerk, but I tried to be fly
None of the girls wanted to ride with me, tryna see why
To raise up I had to be gangsta
But I didn't have it, so
I didn't have the holes and designer fabric clothes
That was the life I wanted, to be a popular big shot
And I miss not havin' a care in the world
Except to stare at the girls to hug me
Only considered a buddy
It's funny when I look back to yesteryear

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
It's like a revelation for me here
I finally hooked up with the girl I was chasin' for three years
All like this is me, yeah
Who gon' touch me? It's the old buddy
With a girl so lovely
Movin' up the ladder of importance
Or it's just all in my head, so I often regret
Titling myself as high shelf material
I was never that, I'm forever that
Straight hair and dark lip dude that's half nice
From the female perspective, and he raps tight
That's my name in the hood
It's me, born and raised
Since the 4th grade at Cheapwood
We had a lot of fun nights
House parties and the water gun fights
I was never in 'em
But I loved to watch, I feel restless here
When I look back to yesteryear

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
So now, when I ride through it's kinda crazy like
I'm a senior in high school and I'm lovin' it now
The whole hood's lovin' the style
From the graduates to the little kids runnin' around
Young buck showin' me love, I don't even know
[?] but they just go with the flow
I remember the park dances when I would walk lonely
In the throwback [?]
But it was peace there, always people to meet there
And we had a great time
But lately I recall the days
We clowned around at Mickey D's and Shakey's
Half of the week, just me and capital three
No other way I would have it to be
Actually, I'm connected here
It's crazy when I look back to yesteryear

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear
I'm takin' a trip back, and it's a trip that
The time pass so fast, I really miss that
Feelin' I had, I hope that my message is clear
When I think back to yesteryear
