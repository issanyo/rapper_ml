[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Say hip hop! (Hip hop!)
Say hip hop! (Hip hop!)

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kokane]
A-L, now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody, ‘cause He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes, He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Nuclear power plants and missiles
Real warfare
Yeah, this where the wealthy need welfare
I’m an immortal man on healthcare
Yeah, my cautious conscience give me nightmares
I stopped dreamin' many eons ago though
I paid my dues and rocked the bells, like Quasimodo
On the low though, Soulo only artist on CROWN
Without a solo album in the stores though
I got my opinions, form yours, what do you suggest?
It's been a drill to be ill, you ain't really sick
Who you amusin' next? (Z, Z)

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kokane]
A-L, now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody, ‘cause He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes, He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you, I'm just livin'

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Aye, man, I'm a sort of a rock and a hard place
Like a guitar in the Hard Rock Cafe
They argue about me in barbershops when I got crop
Hmm, what a paradox!
I'm borderline crazy, with a stamped up passport
Gettin' past TSA with shit stashed
Smellin' like a hundred ashtrays
Little white kids askin' for my autograph
Hey, man, I'm off half a Xan, off to my aircraft

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kokane]
A-L, now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody, ‘cause He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes, He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you, I'm just livin'

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
So I say, so I say, so I say, catch another plane
Represent my hood in every state up in the USA
I'm feelin' good today
Feelin' good to be from D.A., I had to do it

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Back to the music, back to the fact I'm actually stupid
Stupid meaning genius, come suck Jesus' penis on Venus
Back to reality, sadly I'm actually Jewish
Or whatever you wish to call me
I don't wanna offend nobody (l'chaim)
Just remind them all, that it's real
Like where the Ark of the Covenant is still
Foolish humans, this is faith without the H
The work is never done, dummy, the lazy will be late
A stewardess who was familiar with my music
Said: “You must be living the life.”
I looked at her with my red eyes
Like, “I ain't going on no vacation
I ain't going on no vacation
Baby, I ain't going on no vacation
'Til I fulfill my vocation."
My vocation, vocation

[Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kokane]
A-L, now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody, ‘cause He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes, He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
He is I and I am Him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

[Outro: Kokane + (Ab-Soul)]
Soulo, Soulo
(They ain't me and I ain't them)
Soulo, Soulo
(They ain't me and I ain't them)
