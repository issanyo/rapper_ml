[Verse 1: Alori Joh]
Don't feed the fire
I'm already steamin' hot boy
Where you been missing
Don't tell me you didn't call 'cos you forgot boy
As soon as think I'm trippin'
Always find a decoy
Out the door there you go
Avoiding my question
Got me here guessing like
What the? (Hahahaha)
Glad you think it's funny
You make a mockery out of me
'Cos you think it's cute when I'm angry
Okay I'll play your little game
But only 'cos I'm anxious to know where your ass been nigga
(Been at the studio man, you trippin')
I already know where this is going
I'm gon' start yelling, you gon' start smoking on the couch
And I'm gon' be ready to spaz out
So in order to avoid all that

[Hook]
Can we find a happy medium
Can we find a happy medium
Can we meet in the middle (happy medium)
Can we find a happy medium

[Verse 2: Alori Joh]
A woman's intuition feels suspicious
Because of his actions
Tired of assuming jumping to conclusions
So can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway boy?

[Hook]
Can we find a happy medium
Can we find a happy medium
Can we meet in the middle (happy medium)
Can we find a happy medium

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Always tryna start with me
Ugh, here we go with this again
I hate to chase the wind but I remember when
Similarities outweighed the differences (you remember that)
And since this is a joint venture like I sense it is
I try to use censorship 'cos you sensitive
You know it's hard when you serving like sentences (stop)
And every time we get into it
You insist I'm playing you like an instrument
When I just want to be intimate
I know I missed your call
I know I said that I'd be back and I'm still gone
What's the big deal?
Why you always make one out of something real small?
We losing common ground
'Cos you be wilin' out
I'm finna hit the couch and light another menthol
Let's compromise a little
Meet me in the middle
You know I'm tryna make your family my in-laws
Once we..

[Hook: Alori Joh and Ab-Soul]
Can we find a happy medium
Can we find a happy medium
Can we meet in the middle (happy medium)
Can we find a happy medium

[Pre-Outro: Alori Joh and Ab-Soul]
Oh you just gon' be mad?
I'll tickle yo ass

[Outro: Alori Joh]
Love shall always have a place to belong
