[Verse 1: Da$h]
Sinister as givin Manson literature to children
Thoughts of a youthful villain
Windows floor to ceilin
Feelin like Patrick Bateman, off that medication
Only [?] my patience, cause I'm knowin Hell is waitin
Still a shit talkin, blunt sparkin
Henny bottle to the face type nigga
Take yo mama on a date type nigga
Half a pint, I mean an eight my nigga
Straight act bitch, I'm too throwed to react shit
The black Jaques Mesrine, Xannies and the cess green
Load up like a motherfuckin chess team, you know heem
Its Dolla hoe, bitches blowing yaba off the ivory coast
Havin dinner on lobster boat
I spit the shit to give Barack a poke
Give a cop a choke
Bumpin Flocka in the chopper smoke
Nigga, light the dope nigga
Yo, light the dope, no hope for the weak
Four Os in the cream, with four hoes in the jeep
Two cups, cause its only for me, you know
Came up off of one too many Narco's and parked yo shit
Dolla Darko, backwood full of ARCO
Opiates flow and I hope my heart go
Still jumpin niggas after rap shows
Still rob a nigga if the cash low
Same nigga sleepin back of class yo
Miseducation gettin bad though
The government is like the fucking Muppets
Obama just another fucking puppet
You know it and you motherfuckers love it
Ain't shit changed unless you do it my nigga

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I feel like i'm finished soul searching
I feel like i know my soul purpose
I appreciate your purpose
From what I got from that, I know that it's worth it
An aside from that, I know I could give it all back with interest
To show my sentiments that they be interested in Soul
Glow like Afro-Sheen, I've always been a natural
Disasters happen every time I wake up, asshole
Take us for what we make up, that's cold
As a chain from Jacob
Ain't no limitation to my style, i go to Hell
With a barrel and a arrowhead and put the fire out
Off a high amount of Reefer, a bean or 3, four of lean
Exposing the holes and the hoaxes affecting this globe
In a flow nobly, to most it's so serene
I told Nicole at RapGenius i'm just sewing seeds
It's just a little Inception to get your thoughts processing
On the way to the club, i figured it out, I'm Lupe Fiasco on drugs
No religious preference, just bundles of love
I must admit, i like a chick that call herself a bad bitch
She took the power out of the word and made it fit
Like we did with nigga, my nigga that's real shit
That's innovation, i'm so sorry if that's degrading
And it's the ? ? ? making the way to the real truth
They say the West coast is back, that's real cute
But where was you when me and Rock, Dot, and Q was in the stu
Beating the mic up, black and blue
Watching the sky turn black and blue
Wishing one day you get a clue
That was like '06 bitch
And my whole squad sick
We got the flu
Like flying in past tense
Meaning i'm past this and past you
