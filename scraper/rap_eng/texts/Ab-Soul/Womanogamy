[Intro]
The goal is not to, uh, make my cup fall
That's the goal, that's the ultimate goal
One wrong move in this motherfucker gone fall over
Ayy

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, I got two baby mamas, but I ain't got no kids
Nah, I'm fuckin' with you, them my lesbian friends
Real shit, they been together for over a few years
Every time I smell the sage burning man I think of them
Jade wanna be a surrogate and carry my kids
I'd probably give Lonnie cash if she'll really let me hit
We think she Nefertiti, and I believe it
Unisex said that she turned gold durin' her DMT trip

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
‘Cause I like girls that like girls that's in love with me
Just promise me you'll remain anonymous
She said am I faithful, I said I'm womanogamous
Womanogamous, womanogamous
She asked am I faithful
Womanogamous, womanogamous
‘Cause I like girls that like (I like girls that like)

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul & ScHoolboy Q]
From the womb to the tomb, nigga
Put that womb in the tomb, nigga (Womanogamous)
I said from the womb to the tomb, nigga
Keep that womb in the tomb, nigga (Womanogamous)
From the womb to the tomb, nigga
Leave that womb in the tomb, nigga
Amber Rose taught you how to be a bad bitch
This should be your favorite track, bitch! (Turn me up, fool!)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm a Pisces, I got Aphrodite in my back
Pocket on the ring of my keys
Hope her and her son Eros get where they supposed to go
They playin' tug of war with me, and I can't bend no more
I'm too emotional for that, but I don't show it
If I'm two fishes tied by the tail, then where I'm goin'?
Hold that thought, next scene, shit, it would be the moaning
I give her morning wood, then roll my wood up in the morning
Finesse this flow from Lucki Eck$
I’m finger-fuckin' Mother Earth
Put my thumb up in her butt, then roll like a was bowlin'
Gettin' comatose and high, they on my pole ‘cause I told 'em
I guess if you was Nuit you would know it
And Christ died at 33, and she at 33
And she was born on two eleven; that’s a robbery
Damn, she done stole my heart from me

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
‘Cause I like girls that like girls that's in love with me
Just promise me you'll remain anonymous
She said am I faithful, I said I'm womanogamous
Womanogamous, womanogamous
She asked am I faithful
Womanogamous, womanogamous
‘Cause I like girls that like (I like girls that like)

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul & ScHoolboy Q]
From the womb to the tomb, nigga
Put that womb in the tomb, nigga (Womanogamous)
I said from the womb to the tomb, nigga
Keep that womb in the tomb, nigga (Womanogamous)
From the womb to the tomb, nigga
Leave that womb in the tomb, nigga
Amber Rose taught you how to be a bad bitch
This should be your favorite track, bitch! (Turn me up, fool!)

[Outro]
Womanogamous
Didn’t drop the cup, fool! Hahahah
(YMF, nigga!)
