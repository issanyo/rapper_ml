Hey Shetoro, uhm play me that lil latin beat
I wanna read this letter I wrote to my fans
In case I get killed or somethin'
I mean haha, I hope it never happens but
Damn it's just so many haters you never know, alright

[Verse 1]
As I read this letter and as you listen
I know right now I'm either dead or in prison
I'm writing this words as my daughter sleeps
I pray this is something I never have to read
The year is two thousand and I've signed with Universal
All the hate can't stop me but it still hurts though
The smoke in my blunt can only hide my pain
My security is outside but I still sleep in the rain
They say that my lyrics destroy and kill
But I'm only trying to tell them that I know how they feel
I never had both of my parents
I was three when he left, and ended the marriage
Most things I rap about, I no longer do
Tomorrow is church and after that is the zoo
Diamonds and cars don't make a man happy
Your jewels in life are your friends and family
The more money I make, the more problems appear
I feel my enemies are closing in getting near
Inspired by jealousy they wish me the worst
I shook the hands of men that want me stiff in a hearse
But everything I do, is so that one day
Our kids can see their own kind in a positive way
Although I'm no angel in God I do trust
I'd like to take a second to tell you about us
Rasheed is from Philadelphia, Low-G is from Honduras
I was raised with my guela in a place called Falfurrias
But we're all the same race and that race is player
I've held two jobs ditch digger and brick layer
Now I see a sign as I lay in the chalk
Heaven is seven million miles, Lord don't make me walk
