I was a teen, when i seen that this world was a scam
Pushed me into the earth, an all i ever seen was lamb
I keept looking for answers, but nothing was their
The darkness started surrounding, only thing was despair

[Verse 1: Exodu$]

If I had one wish, It wouldn't be money
It would be that we could just get together as a country
Cause everyday is like a battlefield in war
And it seems, no one sees what we really fighting for
I don't mean to deep, news media has everyone sheep
We in the dark, an the government they always sweep
I ate Ramen Noodles, in every way that you could ever make it
When your hungry, it doesn't matter you just really take it
My mom did her best, she would always put me first
Even though we had more dead things laying around then a hearse
I still had some Jordan's and plenty of clothes
While she was livin' life not caring about what was around her toes
The thunder roars, maybe god is fighting up above
Life is cold, like shoveling snow without a glove
I suffer softly but nothing can ever stop me
And I miss my little boy, like somebody shot me

I was a teen, when i seen that this world was a scam
Pushed me into the earth, an all i ever seen was lamb
I keept looking for answers, but nothing was their
The darkness started surrounding, only thing left was despair

[Verse 2: Exodu$]

Wearing crosses I don't want the diamonds or jewels
I don't about the fame, or the money hungry fools
So much money was spent, while others struggle for rent
So much envy and greed, they don't want to repent
It's a lot of impostors, who try to give you some fame
They don't tell you or disclaim, the evil deeds for a name
From the kills on TV, I really just dont wanna see
The demons in this world, and how it just can really be
I'm not sure you understand this, but these snakes just hiss
Santa Claus, doesn't have money, so he has to miss
And dad you always did your best, and i appericiate you
Now I understand why you did those things that you put me through
We gon' make it I promise, so thanks for all the sonics
I remember how you was keeping real and always was honest
Running away from a home, just to meet my moms dad
Bad luck, but it's okay because, man I am so glad
