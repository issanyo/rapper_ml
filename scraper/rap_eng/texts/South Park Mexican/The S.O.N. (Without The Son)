[Verse 1]
I Recharge You Like Batteries
Fill You Up With Something
That Ain't Got No Calories
I Take Half A Key
And Flip It Like A Pancake
An Alcoholic You Can Tell
Cause My Hands Shake
My Brain Half Baked
And My Heart Frozen Stiff
My Chosen Gift
Got Pushed Off An Ocean Cliff
My Gloomy Styles
Put A Nigga In A Roomy House
Time Passed
Take A Look Where They Put Me Now
I'll Be Home Soon
Let Me Do These Thousand Months
Then Pick Me Up In A Limo
Full Of Crown & Blunts
All My Life
Full Of Struggle & Trouble
She Was Missin' At My House
Like The Discovery Shuttle
Is It Hope For Los?
Man I Just Can't Call It
Doin Push-Ups In My Cell
With My Homie Muhammed
He A Muslim, I'm A Christian
But It Make No Difference
Neither One Of Us
Will Get A Fucken Thing For Christmas

[Chorus]
Don't Cry When I'm Gone
Just Get High To My Song
This Is My Truth
I Apologize If It's Wrong
I Was Raised 2 Blocks
From A All Day Corner
Born In The Storm
I'm The Son Of Norma

Don't Cry When I'm Gone
Just Get High To My Song
This Is My Truth
I Apologize If It's Wrong
I Was Raised 2 Blocks
From A All Day Corner
I forgot my dad's name
But my mom's named Norma

[Verse 2]
The Dreams That I Had
Fell Apart With Time
On The Corner Posted Up
Like The March Of Dimes
When I Start To Rhyme
People Start To Listen
South Park Where You Ain't
Too Smart For Prison
Got A Heartless Vision
It's A Heart Condition
Pull A Gun Never Run
Let It Spark & Twist 'Em
My Apartments Isn't
Just Your Average Place
You Can Walk To The Laundromat
And Catch A Case
I Be Last In Place
Another Ghetto Kid
And Then Hit One Lick
And Buy A Benzo 6
It's A Crazy Spot
And Everyday It's Hot
Where The Pimps Gettin' Paid
But His Ladies Not
Where The Daughters Are Dying
And The Mommas Are Crying
And The Sons & The SON
Facing All This Time
And The Bottom Line Is
If You Slip Just Once
You Could Do About
A Thousand And Fifteen Months

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Has Your Car Antenna
Ever Disappeared In The Night?
He Wasn't Tryin To Be Mean
He Just Needed A Pipe
One Thing About A Dope Fiend
They Always Chasing
That High
That Will Never Satisfy Their Craving
Nobody Will Save Em
Gotta Pray For Help
But Where's Hope?
When They Don't Wanna Save Themself
All The Money Was Filthy
And The Feelings Were Guilty
Why The Fuck You Think I Drank
Till It Almost Killed Me
The Real They Feel Me
And The Rest Of 'Em Love It
I Guess The Life Of A G
Is An Interesting Subject
And I'm Like Fuck That
I Just Rap How I Live It
I'm The King Of Houston
A Lot Of Niggas Hate To Admit It
I Bust First No Questions
Fuck With Blacks & Mexicans
Some Real White Boys
That Will Kill Like Chechens
Muhammedâ€™s Korean
I'm Wrapped In Indian Skin
I Give A Fuck About Race
I Let Real Niggas In

[Chorus] (x2)
