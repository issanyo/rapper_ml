Uh, all alone on my throne with my styrofoam
I'm all alone on my throne with the styrofoam
With the muthafuckin' styrofoam

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I'm a fool
I'm a nut
I'm a nigga from the cut
Split the blunt roll it up
& the deuce is what I chunk
I'm a prosper
Spittin' street gospel
Baby Basherini man the modern day apostle
Lacin' up my boots
Man I'm slappin' on my spurs
Smokin' on derb
In the Burb hittin' curbs
& buy when that occurs
My music's gonna splurge
Automatic causin' havoc
Cause I caused a power surge
Wit the California herb
H-Town wit the lean
These million dollar words got me on that big screen
I ain't gonna lie
I'm in it till I die
So muthafuck you America's apple pie!

[Chorus:] [Baby Bash:] [x2]
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
"Hoes say I'm so mean
When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing."

[Verse 2: Grimm]
See I flip what I got
Turn cold to hot
Twist the knot
Turn the block
Hell I hold the spot
Drop a line
Friend of mine
Spend my word on the cut
You got the time
I got the pine
Plus the syrup in the cup
Get the soda the more the merrier
Laws in the area
Steady stare at ya
Break the barrier
I'm a take care of ya
See
You work with me
I'll do dirt with you
We could do 2 or 3
But it be worth a few
In & out
But know we done connected the city
To the county cross state
& we break 50 50
Split the scene
Make the getaway clean
For the cream
Live the dream off the bean
& I love sippin' lean

[Russell Lee:]
You know we never sober
Givin' money in the soda
We heavyweighters & soldier's
Pushin' big bulldozers
You know we never sober
Givin' money in the soda
We heavyweighters & soldier's
Pushin' big bulldozers
It's just me & my lean
You know what I mean?
I'm on the scene
Stackin' my green
I done finally accomplished my dream
I'm givin' it up
Not givin' a fuck
Pourin' shit up
Happy P pass the Styrofoam Cup

[Chorus:] [Baby Bash:] [x2]
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
"Hoes say I'm so mean
When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing."

[Verse 3: Ikeman & Lil' Villain]
[Lil' Villain & Ikeman]
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone on codeine
Promethazine
[Ikeman:]
Iced up bezatine
Wit a whole new team
[Lil' Villain:]
Candy green
Purple lean
[Ikeman:]
If you know what I mean
I'm takin' the 8 with grape
I'm goin' hard it's all great
[Lil' Villain:]
I'm sippin' drank state to state
Shut 'em down 'til they break
[Ikeman:]
We some Mexicans sippin' drank
Lil' Villain pass the dank
I'm goin' hard in that thing
[Lil' Villain:]
It's That vato 'bout his bank
[Ikeman:]
Once you make it in the game
It's all the same up out my chains
Fuck with them
It ain't no thing
We shut 'em down
We ain't playin'
[Ikeman & Lil' Villain:]
We some South Side flippers
Codeine sippers
In the candy coated Cadillac smokin' Swishas

[Baby Bash:]
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup

[Chorus:] [Baby Bash:]
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts
It's just me & my Styrofoam Cup
"Hoes say I'm so mean
When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing..."

"Sip codeine
Hoes say I'm so mean
When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing. Cause..."
