A child of the ghetto
Know how to sleng me an elbow
I made a deal with the devil
Then came up out the cevil
Kilo, so fuck a hero
In my back yard
Is now where my weed grow
I make the block bleed
Servin fiends in need
I did my first murder
At the age of seven-teen
So now it's biziteen
Imagen pinkie ring
Choppen up the scene
Candy coated limisune
So whatcha wanna see
I'm ballin at twenty-three
Sippin down pea
This is my disteny
I'm pimpin big canton
From Houston to San Anton
My pistol grip is chrome
Bustin ballas at your dome
Took a trip to rome
But i made it back home
Sittin all alone
I'm on the Latin Throne
WHAT!!!

[course] 2x
I'm the child of the ghetto(ghetto)
Said i'm the child of the ghettooo

Now weeto home boy
My people trip on the halle
My people killin my people
And we dont know what to call it
Fuckin a barrio war
For the niggas who live in the ??
?? right at the people for who do
Never can go strong as the right??
Dealin' with democrates
Eatin' like fuckin rats
Jackin' with ??
That's because your to poor to have a gat
Gotta da make it better way
But your sister won't let you
Trap deep in your jail cell
I be the locas who down
Fools don't you know my familia
Got ?? in shelter
I'm keepin dose in the summer
I'm rockin show's in the winter
Makin somethin for nothin
??
Now im hittin licks with some tricks
Just to bring home some gravy
?? on my rollex
?? on my lexis
I'm keepin it real for my people
On the grind that have da hustle
To you vatos lowridein and players
That got it made
Turn your life around now
And ask god for a better way! uhh!

Course 2x

Sometimes a niggar wish
That i can get away
From the shit today
Damn there's got to be
A better way
Dont you ever say that you can't
Get out your predicument
Change for the better
Cause dont know when i can give a shit
If you innocent, if you guilty and just sayin it
Barely makin it and motherfuckers say
That they hate me
Kick dos and batteries
Get for my family
Gotta ford da salary
Dat little sisters had da eat
It's sad to see that tradgity
And agginy of casuolty
Heard some niggas after me
And dont know the half of me
If that's the way it has to be
Then god let'em murder me
Standing here today but
Dont know if i deserve to be
But i can't let it worry me
I gots to make my feria
My only fear is god
So dont think i'll be a scard of ya
I stay two steps ahead of ya
So ain't nobody holdin me
My boy's out here will bury ya
So why dont you fuck over me
