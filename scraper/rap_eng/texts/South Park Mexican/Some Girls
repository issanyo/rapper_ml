[Intro: South Park Mexican and Tommy G]

[South Park Mexican]
Yo Tommy G?
Look at that mark ass nigga  all pussy
Over that same freak Boosty did last week
[Tommy G]
Man a bitch will never have our click like that
[SPM]
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus 1 repeat 1x: Lifestyl and SPM]
Some girls don't like that
Some hoes don't like that
Some girls don't like that
Some hoes don't like that

[Verse 1: SPM]
Ya'll niggas eatin ass land pearl
From a nasty girl
I get around collecting nuts like a flyin' squirrel
Come inside the world of a telephone road pimp
That hoe shit will get ya fuckin' throat slit
I won't quit I'm non-stop
I share pussy while you hoe niggas got block
Block csught
Knock Knock
Who's there
A true playa
Here to take you to to square
It's not fair
The way I got the game sown up
Other niggas try but thry ain't got no luck
Big ole butts
Ghetto sluts
I got more bitches than hoes r us
Ha ha ha

[Chorus 2 repeat 1x:  SPM]
Some girls don't like that
Some hoes don' like that
Some girls don't like tha
Some hoes don't like that
Fuck 'em
Girls don't like that
Some hoes don't like that
Some girls don't like that
Some hoes don't like that
Fuck 'em

[Verse 2: Pancho V]
Uh
Some girls don't like when I pull it out
Some girls don't like when I cum in they mouth
Some hoes don't like it when you cum too quick
Some hoes don't like it if you think you the shit
Some girls don't like it when I smile at they friends
Some hoes don't like it but I do it again
And some girls don't like it when I shine in my car
Some girls don't like it and you know who you are
Some girls don't like it when they see me actin' bad
Some hoes don't like it but I guess they gone be mad
Some girls don't like it when I'm all in playa mode
And some girls don't like it but that's the way the shit goes

[Chorus 2 repeat 2x: SPM]

[Verse 3: Tommy G]
You know I'm fuckin' down like no other
Straight balla lover
Leave a freak up in a room
And throw her draws in the gutta
Some girls don't like it but I don't give a ghetto damn
Have your pussy fuckin' broke
And I know this you understand
Shiny things I know you like to do it all
Give me a call
Meet you at the spot and then I'm fucking you raw
Lean back unto the scene
Once again once again
When we getting' naked
Dykin' with they two closest of friends
Knock 'em off the block
And breakin' them off
It's nuthin' new
Baby what you wanna do
I wanna do it too
Freakin' and climbin'
Fuck in the dinin'
All I know in life
Is the shit we combinin'
Makin' major moves while we doin' our thang
While fuckin' in this game a player has to maintain

[Chorus 2 repeat 1x: SPM]
