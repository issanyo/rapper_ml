Dope House Records....
Dope sells itself, BIATCH!!!!
The real always gonna recognize the real...
If y'all muthafuckas want some
Then come get you some potna

First (and only) verse [SPM]:

For every city that I come to
This for every bitch that I run through
This for every hater in the Universe
Stayin' one step ahead, I'm shootin' first
For every killa lookin' for some employment
I'm a nigga that you don't fuckin' toy with
This is for my enemies and homies
If you got a strong family then join me
Everything I say, be safely said
While me and my niggas keep breakin' bread
Don't hate the Mex, it's obvious
That you don't wanna see my people prosperous
In God We Trust, put down your guns
For my niggas locked down for a thousand months
I'ma bounce and bust, sell an ounce of dust
The wetback, I suggest you get down with us

Chorus (Courtney Jones):

Welcome to the Dope House
Welcome to the Dope House
This is for my killas, killas, killas
This is for my killas

(SPM)

Peace to my home boy Mansa
