[South Park Mexican:]
Yo, this SPM, man
This The End of my album
I want to tell everyone that got love for us, I want to say thanks
Thanks for buyin' this album
& thanks for jammin' my shit
We got love for you players, man
I don't care what side you from, what set you from, what color you claim
All I ask is that you don't curse the innocent children
Cause they deserve to be happy
Dope House Family
My boy Rasheed, Low-G, Happy Perez, Juan Gotti, Coast, Quarter Ki, DFO, Pete & Red Bird, Tragedy, Sham, homie Marco, my sister Sylvia, Omar, Jose & Sisco
Look out for my Screwston CD's
If it ain't screwed up it ain't 'bout shit
What up, little papa? Dumb-dumb droppin' an album
