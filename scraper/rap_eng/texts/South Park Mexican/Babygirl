[2nd Verse *South Park Mexican):]
Well I like the Thug Girl with the big brown eyes
SPM baby on the rise
She got rashache & a big gold chain
Drivin' outta state with my cocaine
She know how to roll big fat sweets
Holla nigga you can smoke if you match me
Shoot big dice
Jam spice crew eat food with the hands & drink guys rule
I do it for you 'cause you care about me
When I was locked down in Harris county
Puttin' money on my books for my comercery
All my broke homies at home watchin' Jerry
I Told her I was very hooked on Miss Mary
She said she had a boyfriend that she wanted me to bury
From there we hit it off & I must admit
Thug Girl your thuggin' & I'm lovin' it

[Chorus: [Low-G]
Thug Girl your the reason why
I love you so

Thug Girl "Thug Girl"

[3rd Verse (Pimpstress):]
Well I'm that Thug that you can't resist
Crazy ass bitch I was made for this
Got a house full of dope
Million dollar click nena ross givin' birth to 17 kids
Can you fit when you get extra clip on my hip?
Holla tits let it zip all through your shit
If you pass the cementary on main & 5th
You can see a collection of my greatest hits
Havin' zipped ondrary under contrary
If ya'll feel me then holla already
Some of you broads become old news
Gettin' tagged team & wrecked up by who knows who
Well rule #1 you wanna touch for fun you get touched by gun
Until you fuck with son huh?
I unload more 'til outta control
'Cause when the sun goes down it's a muthafuckin' jungle
