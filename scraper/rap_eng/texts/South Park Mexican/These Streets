[Verse 1: SPM]
Sunshine in the wind with the bald fade
Gotta keep my drank down 'cause them laws hate
Out the roof deuce chunkin' 45 dumpin'
H-Town is just like Compton
Kick doors, telescope hit fours
Make you boys sound softer than wet dough
Stack dollars went to crack college
I like my salad with extra black olives
Acknowledge keep my Lac polished
Don't mistake me for a fuckin' rap artist
I'm the one that shot slugs in your hot tub
Leave your bitch ass screwed & chopped up
None left known for car theft
But in the kitchen I'm the one, the top chef
I cool whip it, I ain't bull shittin'
Turn 25oz to a new chicken

[Hook: Carolyn Rodriguez]
Smoke bud 'cause it's my therapy
Take a .44 slug, turn that bitch to a memory
Can't show no love, cause these hoes bring jealousy
So I run with the thugs, these streets keep callin' me

[Verse 2: Rasheed]
Let the bombs fly nigga we can all die
But wait a second first I gotta tell my mom bye
Maybe we can talk it out up in god's sky
Rasheed got more nuts than pecan pie
I'm the wrong guy homey I don't fuck around
I've been a gangsta since way before Hustle Town
SP Low G ain't no hoe in' us
I don't eat alot of sweets but I smoke a bunch
You can go to lunch & nigga you can go to hell
Fuck the radio this shit is still gonna sell
Like I told my bitch, if I'm ever killed
You'll never find another muthafucker more real
But say Los maybe we can get some airplay
And talk about some of that bullshit that they say
All the ladies in the house say "ohhhhh"
Damn I forgot I'm in this bitch all alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: SPM]
Los is a crawler, House-ton got taller
Up in H-Town move slow like koala
20's on the prowler starin' at the mirror
17 coats to make the paint clearer
Up in my ride got my nuts and my pride
Keep a few hoes that I fuck on the side
Paper chase me crib on the laker
Ride through the trey, Sprewell skater
Breaker 1-9 shine in the sunshine
My Nextel phone sound like the love line
All day service got Jane burnin'
My weed is lime green like frog named Kermit
Bustin' fuck the repercussions
Blast him right before the radio luncheon
Bloody murder, not much of a converser
'Cause I say more bad words than a computer cursor

[Hook]
