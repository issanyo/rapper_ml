Verse 1

Dim lights on the streets
Dim lights on the streets
Dim lights on the streets sillhouttes of Gs
Hear the wind in the trees as it pets the leaves
3 in the morning the silent storm
Where babies are addicted by the time their born
Cars pull up people short on cash
 20 dollar bill ready for 4 gas
16 for a brick, it ain't happening bro
 Give me 20 for my slab push your car back home
In the eyes of a blinking man takes its toll
Cuz he gave his soul for the caine you hold Snow turn to stone like it's watchinh medusa and my hood got more rockstars than llolapaloza
Life full of strief never see our dreams
 i tell it how it is homie not how it seems
We ballin dawg but late at night alone
We knowing deep inside how our life unfolds

Chrous

They take a chance with they life
They in a trance, hustling thru the night
Oh can't they see? That we'll always
Penintentiaries or eternal rest

Verse 2

Such a treachearous game and by a caine by a boat
Blowing sweets to be stuffed with incredible hulk
Trynna ease my mind on a cut full of stress One shawty thinks but for what to impress. Gold diggers car poppers aka wheel watchers all it brings is car jackers it creates more problems
 Ice on the chain, ice on the watch Ice on my teeth when i smile at the cops
And the dope fiend i got in my family
Told me you fiend for rocks just as bad as me even though yours shine, and mine get smoked
They both i'll have us dead or doing time for coke
Or id chase like a dog, chasing its tail
What do we get from our love when we base it on mail
Miss memories of days that will pay for piece, sacrifice for a life on these gangster streets

Chrous
They take a chance with they life
They in a trance, hustling thru the night
Oh can't they see? That we'll always
Penintentiaries or eternal rest

Verse 3

I feel like they aiming at my head while i step thru my house
Tell my mom keep the curtains close when I'm around
Enemies over turf over drugs
My homie got jacked and he swore it was us
Hard enough trynna stay away from graves and cages
At a job where you need the AK's and gauges
Many ways you can catch a hot one to the mug
From the dude that you hate to the women you love
Nightmares of my casket and suffering fan
And i can only reach heaven by the blood of the lamb
Can you forgive all the sins i stacked to the sky
(The work has been done, you have to decide)
Hillwood is the land of the home invaders
Its some boys smoke dope, but most smoke haters
But dont hate us, I'm only here to spread some game
See we didn't have a choice we were bred to slang

Chrous

They take a chance with they life
They in a trance, hustling thru the night
Oh can't they see? That we'll always
Penintentiaries or eternal rest
