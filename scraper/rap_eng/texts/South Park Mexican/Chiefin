[Hook]
Chiefin' on good and Grippin' on Wood
This for my partners, this for my Hood
Pockets on Fat, the Trunk is on Crack
84's pokin' out the new 'lac
(x2)

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Ta Da
Look who Back
With them 84's pokin' out a brand new 'lac
Super duper car, I pull a superstar
You gon' look, I don't give a fuck who you are
See my rims gon' shine, and the bitch gon' mind
And when I chuck it out the roof, deuce goin' blind(?)
Got trees to blow, and they ease my soul
And Probably by tonight I'm gon' need some more
I'm rollin' with a 10, my thick yella friend
Said she had a man but never mentioned it again
Fabulous times, 'til I'm packin' my 9
Cause you know how mo' fuckas get to action at time
Now I'm in it from the Back, I'm in it from the Front
I think I hit her kidney cause I felt that bitch jump
This is how we do in the town blessed by Screw
Shinin' on Martin Luther King Avenue

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
Ta Da
One more again', you now listen to the sounds of the SPM
From a jet black hood, but all bets good
Sunny Side, South Acres, Cloverland, Hillwood
Let the seat Recline, all I see is the Dash
Just tell me when to turn baby, we won't crash
Screwtown, Screwtown, city of dreams
What I love about you, a million things
Sippin' syrup n sizzling, purple Promethazine
Goin so slow like we rollin' in limousines
Soon as I hit the scene, a nigga get triple teamed
Bitches starin' at me like they dyin' to kiss a king
They wanna be Billie Jean and try to combine
Nine months later say his eyes look like mine
Dime in the prime, but I'm MOE, PIMP, SPOG
