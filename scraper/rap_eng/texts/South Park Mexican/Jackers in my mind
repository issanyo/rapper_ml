They wipe tears while I wipe fingerprints off led
They say shoot for the stars, I say shoot for the head
I believe in good times havin' peace & fun
But I'm still in my room tryin' to grease my gun
Can't let it get rusty, if a shoot out breaks
The only thing I want jammin' is my screwed out tape
& tomorrow's the big day gotta get my rest
45 G's out of town, lick buyin' tres
I'm all alone, my girl said that she couldn't make it
Cause she caught a damn cold & her whole body's achin'
& I feel kind of nervous, butterfly's in my stomach
But I drift off to sleep, really thinkin' nothin' of it
Then somethin' wakes me up & I open my eyes
Somebody's in my house, I'm heartbroken
Cause I couldn't tell my Mom "Bye" they finally caught me slippin'
I'm a die like a man homeboy I ain't trippin'

Gun shots to my dome, Jackers In My Home
Nothin' to fancy, just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I chose the life under the curse
I'll be dressed in a suit & finally goin' to church

Dreams of the cream, enemies on different teams
Red beans in my house man this shit is so extreme
I saw 'em' dressed up in all black wit the mask
& I knew they was comin' for the birds & the cash
So I rolled out my bed, hit the floor & start crawlin'
& this is the price that you pay when your ballin'
But how did they get the spare key to my crib?
It had to be my bitch, he gon' die if I live!
Usually I keep a black Glock on my dresser
& I'm hearin' someone whisperin' sayin' "Los's I'm a getcha!"
& I'm knowin' it's the devil but I pay it no mind
I been dodgin' that fool ever since I was 9
Gotta make it to the closet, where I keep my Mossberg
Slug shots, one hit, never speak another word
Little did I know they had night vision goggles
When they saw me on the floor boy squeezed on the throttle

Gun shots to my dome, Jackers In My Home
Nothin' to fancy, just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I chose the life under the curse
I'll be dressed in a suit & finally goin' to church

Shots started rangin' I was tumblin' & divin'
Runnin' out of time, with my mind on survivin'
Dove out the window but I started seein' stars
I forgot last week 'bout some burglar bars
Now my face is all wet & I know it ain't sweat
Bullet hit my leg so I rolled to the left
Guess where I was at? Damn right, in the closet!
Grabbed a pump, now it's my turn to make a deposit
Damn slugs ain't no punk hit the boy in his back
Saw his right leg flyin' & it knocked down my lamp
Unloaded, reloaded, was a 3 man army
Now they lookin' like pitas at the end of a party
One was still alive so I start askin' questions
He could barely talk, spitin' blood like venom
He said he had a team & that people would rent him
I kill the messegers now I need who sent em'
