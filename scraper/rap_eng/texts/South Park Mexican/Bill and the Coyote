Verse 1: SPM]
Now this is a book about a couple of dudes
That be doing the type of shit that come on the news
Bill and the Coyote is on the loose
A true story, this ain't fuckin' Dr. Seuss
Comfort Inn was the name of the telly
Cops found a white car laying on his belly
3 bullet holes on the passenger side
But on the other had about 25
Who's in the trunk? they opened it up
It's a lady and a man tied and gagged up
A bullet must've hit him when they shot at the car
They pulled it out his ass and put it into a jar
The bitch was bruised up, and so was he
He took a deep breath and looked up at the chief
He told of a duo, and so did she
Of a two that wanted your shit for free

[Hook: Carolyn Rodriguez]
Beware of Bill and the Coyote
Bill and the Coyote
Coming for your shit

[Verse 2: SPM]
Cops padded up the car but no prints
Dogs barking as they jump your fence
They make it back home safe and untouched
One motherfucker asked the other "how much?"
6 keys and 30 thousand George Washingtons
And they still can't catch they oxygen
Let me tell you exactly how the day went
First of the month and these fools gotta pay rent
So they robbed two different cribs
The first one went just like this
A wife with no kids, baby don't scream
When her husband came home it was just like a dream
He parks in the garage, Bill's got a Glock
Saying don't trip homie I'm just doing my job
They took the car and the rolex watch
And put the couple in the trunk so they can't call the cops

[Hook: Carolyn Rodriguez]
Beware of Bill and the Coyote
Bill and the Coyote
Coming for your shit

[Verse 3: SPM]
Next thing you know, ol' Bill's a millionaire
With the wind in his hair, driving on Bel-air
They screaming in the trunk so they pull to the side
And told 'em if they shut the fuck up they would live to survive
Pulled up to this house, and come from the back
Blast blast it's a jack take the cane and cash
You could hear the gunshots from a mile away
They jump back in the car into the hideaway
They stopped at the light, it felt like 3 hours
When this bitch turns green the fucking world is ours
Hit the showers at the trump towers
And buy the whole motherfucking club flowers
Growling, howling at the moon
El Coyote was the name of the other dude
But hold up to the left, to the right
Boys blasting guns all they see is flashing lights
They ran the red light and got side swiped by a jeep
It was arsenal machines and automatic magazines
Fucking pure luck, not a cut or a scrape
They lost 'em in the hood and got on beltway 8
The car was shot up but it's a beautiful day
They park it at the telly next to Casa Ol√©
And if y'all wondering how the book ends
Them stupid motherfuckers still took the rims

[Hook x2: Carolyn Rodriguez]
Beware of Bill and the Coyote
