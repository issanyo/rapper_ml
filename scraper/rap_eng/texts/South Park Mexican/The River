[Verse 1]
How the fuck you gonna fuck with me that's the question
One peace is the peace you can rest in
I will rap like the shit was my invention
Straight bullet but I hit with intention
Rock curler scamer got the o donnas
Pretty hoes with legs like obamas
Every album I release is like genocide
Aka pesticide better than the best alive
I'm recording where my songs are forbidden
Bitch you can't stop me as long as I'm living
13 for a brick I'm on that sorta shit
Come short with it you in a horror flick
It's all g life still smoking peace pipe
While I take a nap underneath the street light
Lookin' for Los ? Look for more souljas
Cause I'll have your peeps looking for closure

[Hook]
Who's that that floats in the river
The competition
I told you los was a killa
You wouldn't listen

[Verse 2]
The 600 on 20 inch starfish
Hallow tip did da rip through your cartilage
Any vulture any fucking hyena
Leave them stiff like Jeans at the dry cleaners
And the wife be the light blue dickie pants
Catch you slippin scope on him as he picks his ass
Born killa hillwood gold getta
Wave bye as he float down a cold river
Jack rippa like a jacka worpian
I write in pencil this is how a story end
Rhyme wicked forensic scientific
You can't see me dog unless you buy a ticket
Blunt hittin let the heat up lift em
The specifics must be left un written
He got a chest full of nino ross off spring
I'm not a bitch bitch I told you not to cross me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The 8th born, runt of the litter
Look I got legs I am not the placenta
Momma only got 7 tits that works
So I fight everyday just to get me a squirt
Last name Maxamus, first name Glutamus
Jackass have me like why did he shoot at us
Fuck with me it's pain and drama
Son I will hunt you like your names Osama
Call me bird watcher you got white bricks
I'm Robin like I'm Batman's sidekick
Everyone telling me stop drop roll
But I stay on fire like rasta smoke
Competition bore me who you suppose to be?
Number one nigga please you ain't close to me
Get dealt with sleep with the jelly fish
Have you on some more someone please help me shit

[Hook]

Uuh east cost
West cost
Mid west
Dirty south
Rippin and rhyme'em
