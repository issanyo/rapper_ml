[South Park Mexican:]
Another deadly ceremony
In a sacred territory
It was all done for the glory
You bitches ain't got nothin' for me
O G from the H I double L W double O D
Live the life of the lowly
Movin' white ponies, still puttin' in work for the dead homies
Show me your way out, stayin' ready for anything under the sun
Under the moon, under the stars, God I'm lookin' for somewhere to run
Dumpin' my gun, as soon as I'm done
Leavin' 'em numb with one in his lung
Livin' fast & dyin' young, always business never for fun

[Chorus:]
Tell me what it is
Tell me what you want
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish

Tell me what it is
Tell me what you need
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish

[South Park Mexican:]
Bustin' our teflon, at the red dawn
I ain't fuckin' with nothin' get stepped on
The purest, I'm the surest, playin' a tourist walkin' through Saigon
Been a hustla' servin' up big bricks
& livin' my life to hit licks
Trip on a G like me & see them beads of banana clips Trick
Stamina cannot be duplicated
Bite on the dust, you get faded
So many wannabe criminals up in the game of the drug related
Open up, open up new Dope Houses
Turnin' you men into mouses
Saggin' my burgendy trousers
Just Lettin' you know how the South is

[Chorus:]
Tell me what it is
Tell me what you want
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish

Tell me what it is
Tell me what you need
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish

[South Park Mexican:] "Alright my nigga. Are you sure about Lil' Drugs?"
[Grimm:] "I'm sure man, he's gone baby, he's gone. We gotta get these muthafuckers."
[South Park Mexican:] "Alright, hurry up."
[end's phone conversation, South Park Mexican starts talkin' to himself:]
[South Park Mexican:] "Okay, this is it, I've wished for money & I've wished for fame, but what good is it, if I'm still stuck in this game? So, for my 3rd Wish...
I just wish for all this shit to stop. Just please make it stop."

[South Park Mexican:]
I'm back once again for revenge
In an all-black bulletproof Benz
How will I get 'em? It just depends
Hook his ass up with all his dead friends
Here ye' here ye' sincerely
Why so many haters fear me?
Dearly departed, y'all started some shit & struck but couldn't come near me
We're the odyssey, young prodigy, runnin' the top notch properties
Where snitches get shot in they arteries, but gettin' nobody's apologies
Follow me. How do we master the first jack?
Since the day I was born I was cursed Black
H-Town's where I'm doin' my dirt at
Robbin' you hoes on horseback. All that!

[Chorus:]
Tell me what it is
Tell me what you want
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish

Tell me what it is
Tell me what you need
For your 3rd Wish
This is your last wish
