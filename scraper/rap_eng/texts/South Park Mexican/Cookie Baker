Don't tell a single soul not even yo' mother
See all these chulas in my city comin' through real, G string panties & shiny white grills
Mini skirts see through shirts hey look so cold it hurts end up in

Hoes like a curve greetin' head sippin' syrup pussy peblo & herb
Girl do what you do & let me get you soaked as you ride, caress, suck & stroke
