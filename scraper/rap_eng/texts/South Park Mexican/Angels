[Intro]
We got Angels all around (It’s going down fo’sho)
I was once lost but now I’m found

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders (got angels)
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby (haha Yeaahh)
I was once lost but now I’m found

[Verse 1: SPM]
Father please help me with the lyrics at hand
I don’t wanna misrepresent the miracle man
But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she’s on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it’s my gift
Her hand was heavenly
Since 1970
Every hug, every kiss, every book she read to me
My dad might of left but he was always around
He became my best friend, I will die for him now

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I’m found

[Verse 2]
We all got Angels
Some you can see
I’m writing mine down I’m on 103
And I can keep on going till the end of my life
An incredible sight
An unforgettable ride
And it still ain’t over
Tho I’m deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain’t trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don’t know what it cause
And I’m not saying that I’m any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain’t blind but it’s times, I’m too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I’m found

[Verse 3: SPM]
We all face obstacles and difficult times
We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it’s easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I’m loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn’t
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep
Imma pray for the angels he sent to me

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I’m found
