Chorus: repeat 2x (Rasheed)
Youse a snitch, a stone cold bitch
Given up ya homies ya went to school with
There's too many rats, and not enough cheese
With friends like that we don't need enemies

[Verse 1 - Rasheed]
Youse a snitch
A motherfuckin' rat
Barkin' at ya dog so that makes you a cat
PUSSY informant
Turned dormant
Cause ya got caught in hard rain pourin'
Feds buggin' my bed now instead of me sleepin'
I'm hearin' quiet beepin'
Watchin' little lights bleepin'
Stakeout while they eat Chinese takeout
Makin' out my house
Cause I'm quiet as a mouse
I make em sit there 'till they shit in they pants
Patiently waitin' for the chance to advance
You hot on the streets
You gotta mad mob that wanna greet ya
Alotta nine millimeters that a love to meet ya
To each his own
But homey you done crossed the line
So now the soldiers wanna put some holes in ya mind
Stroll down the line hall in the county jail
Lyin' tellin' everybody you made bell

Chorus - repeat 2x

[Verse 2 - South Park Mexican]
This is the evil that men do
Befriend you
Snitchin' in the free world
Snitchin' in the pen too
You said you would be loyal to the end fool
But now you in the hole
And I ain't got a hand to lend you
It hurts my heart
To see you get ripped apart
In South Park
We keep shit in the dark
But you spread light to alotta dopehouses
Told em ounces is why my Cadillac bounces
That arouses killas in my outfit
Luckily I took the jeys out my dad's couches
I lick my lips when they say ya name
I can taste the bitch that ain't Mary Jane

That same nigga that you said you bossed around
Be the same niggas that gone out you in the lost and found

Chorus - repeat 2x

[Verse 3 - Rasheed]
You 52K locked in protected custody
Federal facility doin' ya time in luxury
If it was up to me
I put a slump in ya company
In state penitentiary ya catch a humpin' G
Word in the barrio
Ya partna got doe
Friens of yours
"Oh ya that nigga gots to go!"
How did the pig now the kilo was in the door?
When did he see me and what the hell he stop me for?
It's evident ya turnin' evidence for your liberty
Only cause you couldn't finish your delivery
Sickin' to see the face of a false G
Visit ya lady while ya squabble in the county
Apparently the mob got the clearance
Without no interference
To cause your dissapperance
I bet you thought Uncle Sam really gave a fuck
Now you stuck
Wrapped up like a chuck

Chorus - repeat 2x
