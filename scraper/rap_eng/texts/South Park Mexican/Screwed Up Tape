[Rasheed]
Ma, I'm sorry for the things I did
And GOD, thanks for all the times you let me live
I should of been dead a long time ago
Should of been me and not GÃ¼ero
Foot on the pedal while I race through the hood
Go to Revillations in your little black book
My homies all changing and that fucking shit hurts
I never fuck a friend unless they suck my dick first
Creep and I crawl, ball till I fall
Sell you a 80 won't charge you for the straw
They asked me how long I ever kept a job roughly
Well, I worked six months in the county as a trusty
I went to prison and I came back an animal
Southside, Houstone's murder capital
My crew is cursed, shoot you first
Die next to a stupid nurse
Put you in the bluest hearse
I'll see yo ass at Lucifers

[Hook - 2x]
6 in the morning police at my door
Fresh, Jordans squeeking cross my bathroom floor
Out the back window, I make my escape
Didn't even have a chance to grab my screwed up tape

[Low-G]
My green light, aloe since chiquito caga palo
Haters don't like me cause my name is hard to swallow
Here he comes that 5-O asked me for i.d
Play on his computer and find some felonies
I was high, fried, and D.W.I
Every question asked I came back with a lie
He was searching my ride and found my 45
That's when I started thinking had to bust him with my 9
Instead I ran, now your boy got away
That night we celebrate like it was a holiday
I use to be broke didn't have big faces
I had to wipe my ass with the yellow pages
No T.V. and no cartoons
My jefa in the kitchen washing plastic spoons
I wasn't smokin' tough on green potent stuff
No diamonds on my wrist only, broken cuff

[Hook - 2x]

[South Park Mexican]
Oh no what the fuck, I'mma come have some buck
Who want to fuck with us, brown like snuffleupagus
Pro-tect my property, Hillwood privacy
I don't know how many times I got to tell y'all get off of me
Balls hangin' all I need, smoking bitches crossing me
When I kill you niggas we can all live in harmony
Listen you motherfuckas want a gravestone, I want you once leave us alone
Known to kill my fucking own, claim Houstone cause that's my home
How can I make it anymore clear
My butler look like belvedere
17 million a year, still I'm thuggin about a Cavilier
My people come, like Babylon, mexican and african
Few white boys that's family, asian and mohamilly
Indian that's a Navajo, killers out that mackadoch
Careful how your ass appoach, get busted like you pass a note
All the hoes, camel toes, smoking on that artichoke
Bought the benz, bought the boat, in my kitchen rocking coke

[Hook 2]
Crusing down the street with my 6 hoes
Bumping my shit, riding on vogues
Went to the park to get the scoop
Young niggas out there cold shooting some hoops
