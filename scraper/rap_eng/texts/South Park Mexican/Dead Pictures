[Verse 1: SPM]
It's after midnight while I let this pen write
In my cell it's just me and this dim light
As my thoughts get spilled on a notebook
They shot my homie and I told his girl don't look
Cause if she saw what I saw it would've haunted her
I heard the paramedics laughing with the officer
I guess they see it as just another dead body
And I know it hurt when his daughter said, "Mommy
Where's daddy? I ain't seem him in a long time."
How can mommy talk, she can't even stop crying
The punchline I tomorrow may never come
That's where the cops get 187 from
It means murder not death by natural causes
It means homie's clothes redder than Santa Clause's
In Hillwood many dies facing obstacles
I thank God it's not me in that pile of skulls

[Hook: Carolyn]
Slugs around the block boys
Thugging til they drop laws
Putting G's on lock
So we flush it when they knock
Caught up in the system
These haters play the victim
Wanna see us fall
Like dead pictures on the wall

[Verse 2: Jak Da Ripa]
I saw the reaper in my sleep so I might got a death wish
When vultures come around I react so selfish
If you ain't out of the hood you probably think that I'm crazy
Lot if niggas in jail or they pushing up daisies, I'm
True to myself, this the way God made me
Love my momma to death cause she's the one that raised me
So many mother fuckers dropping out this shit like flies
Heard a friend of mine just committed suicide
Left his family behind, found him hanging from the ceiling
Eyes wide open I just can't imagine the feeling
So many funerals, here I am in all black
Prices put up on my head, so I'm packing a strap
When my life is on the line I bring them killers out
I find your residence and bring the drama to your house
Now all that's left is a memory of your existence
Dead pictures on the wall, bloody murders my vision

[Hook: Carolyn]

[Verse 3: SPM]
They found my homie Desperado in the garbage heap
Wrapped up, throat slit, man the scars are deep
That day it felt like the whole city was crying
Lil D if you hear me nigga give me sign
That dude that had murdered you got twisted by Jason
Had to tell you cause I know that y'all in different locations
Have you seen Lil Lex? The other day he was killed
Niggas don't got no hustle had to take what he built
I'm afraid to even open up today's newspaper
Cause the crow's taking souls like the old show maker
It's enough to make you blow up, throw up, or go nuts
My people dying and I fucking love them so much
My homie's brother got killed in a car chase
Cops tried to pull him over back on Park Place
He hauled ass but it ended when he crashed his Taurus
And he had were some mother fucking traffic warrants
