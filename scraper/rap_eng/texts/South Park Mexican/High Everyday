Uh, I puts it down
Uh, 1, 2, 3

[Verse 1: SPM]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Am I the purest of them all?
Am I the one to ease the pain?
Make them fall to they knees and pray
Mama said son you've got to go
You turned my house into Stop-N-Go
Out the door, please dont call
Till you stop sellin snowball
SP-Mex remember me? The one that deserved penitentiary
With the sack of geen but no gasoline
Peace to my boys up in Pasadene
Its all sweet and beautiful
Shine my nails and cuticles
My duely truck got 7 screens
Watchin "Me, Myself, and Irene"

[Hook: Ayana]
High Everyday
Dopehouse G's
Who never die
Just stay high

[Verse 2: SPM]
Fuck you, you can hate it or love it
Twist the top off the 40, and chug it
Chop rocks off of chicken mcnuggets
Cook 28 and get 39 from it
V-12, miracle whip
46 ounces off one brick
Booger sugar what I slang
In the sunshine or in the rain
Fuck the fake dont fake the funk
Buy my batch and bake it up
Taste my dope and numb your mouth
Pure cocaine straight from the south
Dumpin lead in Houston, Texas
Got you bitches jumpin fences
Runnin for your very life
Slang Al Green and Barry White

[Hook]

[Verse 3: SPM]
Lookin leaned out up in my whip
Smokin that drip, drop, drip
Wishin up on a star, like Christina Aguilar
Flip through Hillwood, visit Mama
She raised me without a Father
Tried her best and nothing less
Still I'm sellin 'caine and sess
Played the trumpet, played the flute
Please dont be afraid to shoot
SPM, mean Carlos Coy
Whatcha say mom? "Thats my boy"
Now I'm rappin and producin
No more H-Town, call it Screwston
Just say no to hate
But me, just stay....

[Hook 2x]
