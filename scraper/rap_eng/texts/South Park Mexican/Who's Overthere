[SPM]
Yeah, I just wanna say that I love all you haters
It's not your fault, you was raised to like the smell of shit
Us playas would like to smell the roses

[Chorus (Marilyn Rylander):]
Who's over there?
No one said that life was fair
You haters come from everywhere
Y'all haters just because you're scared

[SPM]
Broken dreams, to be the coke King
Everyone is sleep except me and the dopefiends
Five A.M. sittin' on the corner
The day's gettin' warmer but my heart is gettin' colder
Sold my last boulder let the storm pass over
Never touch my dope, I'm only the cash holder
Soldier, I sleep with one eye open
In the land where you see men die smokin'
Let the fry soak in, water, water
Hillwood cowboy, fuckin' down the farmer's daughter
Street saga, corner store robber
Like Pasell I take your gal a la cama
Baller, my block hotter than lava
The wetback, in love with my mujada
Papa, shit talker, they drop-uh
SPM, the rap Skywalker

[Chorus]
[Low-G]
Which road will I travel?
White sand or hard gravel?
Fuck a friend, I don't even trust my own shadow
I'm in a battle with the dirtiest of enemies
Cuz I'm chippin' dope, all across the seven seas
Low-G and the wheeze of the Vo-C
At the ranch where my weed plants grow free
December 9, a child was born with no heart
Since a kid, they said I wouldn't go far
Ghetto scars tryin' to keep away from Merro bars
The rudest hours, FUCK Escobar
And the Diez brothers , I roll with top soldiers
If they approach us, I bury those cockroaches

[Chorus]
[SPM]
I ain't start from the bottom, I dug myself out a hole
Grabbed a pen, and taught myself how to flow
Now my snow crystal, my shit primo
Toe taggin' haters with a tiny torpedo
Desillo, me and my nuts make a good trio
I'm the nigga pissin' in my cup for my P.O
Life hit me like a double shot of whiskey
In every song I give a piece of my history
This be reality, they wanna battle me
But that'll be the day, gather up my family
Packin' heat, pick 'em up like a sack of meat
Most my niggas dead, or walkin' round with shackled feet
We had to eat, you can ask these cops
I bought my first hooptie with fifteen rocks
They smoked non-stop, I watched as the crack melted
I comes real cuz I really can't help it

[Chorus]
[SPM]
Yeah this one goes out to all my players
Don't let them haters get you down man
Besides, anybody who lets a hater get em down
Ten times out of ten is a hater, I ain't trippin'
We comin' down baby 2000. It's like that baby
