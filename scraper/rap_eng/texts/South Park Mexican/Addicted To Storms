[Verse 1]
The poor folks feel me the others think that I'm interesting
The rappers thing silently damn if he isn't King
I ain't trying to rub it in its really this fucking pen
Won't let a nigga sleep from the problems is trouble him
Or maybe it's a her while she's spilling this black blood
My girl hates when I snort Coke cause I can't fuck
And why including that I guess cause I trust you
Or maybe cause am gone off this excellent mushrooms
But just for the record I can smoke marijuana
And still fuck like aunt Betty horny Chihuahua
I'm short of saliva that means I suffer cotton mouth
So many dark memories I'm fighting to block'em all

[Hook]
If he's always in some trouble but inside you'd like him
You're addicted to storms and baby he will provide them
The cool cats fade and end up dead or in prison
Or working bullshit jobs cause they never would listen

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that my music ain't for people to dance to
In fact grab your Bible let's please go to Matthew
Naw i'm not a preacher but I'm guessing you know that
But I do give advice like you're too young to smoke crack
No really I'm serious you're fucking crave it all day
I got a friend that sells his ass and he's ain't even gay
But I won't say his name I'm sure the Brett is embarrassed
He's addicted to rocks and I feel bad for his parents
And I know that I'm lost but see I've been through a lot
So try to listen every time that SPM do a talk
Drugs would destroy you but good grades make you beautiful
And if he left school Mommy he is a suitable

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Every nerd making A's stays on top of the game
And there isn't any hope for those caught up in gangs
You only get one chance and Then your adults
Study hard while you're young it brings endless results
And it's always God first because the devil is real
And when you see me on the drop 77 Seville
I hope you tell me something good like the UGK
Because a G stands for graduates of 2G blank
So fill it in I just say it cause you mean so much
And when I tell you that I love you it's extremely such
But this is the end of my 40 so I'm resting my pen
Like the beer commercial say I gotta know when to when right

[Hook]

[Outro]
And I know that you got a crush on my mommy
It makes you feel alive
Right but fuck that
Look at his report card
Space in the on the conduct section
A Dumbass would drag you down with in
Drag you through the mud of ditches and gutters
Some people are they due to storms because they were raised in them
So they become attractive to trouble
But recognize it and fight it
Only you can save you a baby
