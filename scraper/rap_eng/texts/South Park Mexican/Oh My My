[South Park Mexican]
Uh
Yo
I can't hear myself on the mic
Uhh
Yeah, maybe I can
Uh

(Verse 1)
Now take a trip, off the trip and let me trip you out
Cause I'm a trip, I'm a nut, I'm a fool, no doubt
Y'all boys really trippin' on the money I make
But I'm drippin' wet, tryin to kill some [{*putos*}] I hate
Separate, all these fake niggas, all in my face
You a disgrace, you should wish well, for your own race
Tie your laces and hide your two faces, guess I been
Lookin' for love, in all the wrong places
Follow in a trail to the land of hell
Everybody knows I belong in jail
For my raza, anyone else, no tienen chanza
Fuck with my clique, I'll put a hole in your panza
I give two fucks, three shits and one damn
Scram, you bitch, you ain't with my fam
I don't cut for the jealous
Guess where your gal is
All on my weenie like mustard and relish

Chorus: Baby Bash
Oh my, my
Oh, hell yeah
Let's all get to puttin', somethin'
In the air
Fix me a drink and sing, me a song
But do it quick, baby, cause I can't stay long
Oh my, my
Oh, hell yeah
Let's all get to puttin', somethin'
In the air
Man, I'm so blowed, man, I'm so throwed
Somebody grab the wheel, I can't
See the road

(Verse 2)
Mama mia
I wanna put somethin' in Aaliyah
Sippin' Sangria and smokin' on Maria
I drill a nine milli through your liver arm trilla
Lone star state, home of the armadillo
Blow killa with Priscilla, and ganja with Blanca
Catch me at the club in my Nike chanclas
Vida chueca, my girlfriend's name is La Muneca
Dios around my necka, sangre de Azteca
SPM on Choppers like men
Y'all run and hide, while I count to ten
I'm a wait til Fall, then I'll cut my grass
Stop and make my girlfriend pump the gas
I got enough birds to have a snowball fight
My dream is to keep the world up all night
I done sold you a dub sack, used to chase a hub cap
Now I'm in this game, tryin' to see where my love at

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
It's the return
Of that nut, Baby Beeshie, love my chicken greasy
Shittin' on them haters that love to taste the feces
I'm a fool, I'm a nutter
Gone, off the butter
I'm from Vallejo, California, Houston to Calcutta
Gone wacko off tobacco, mixed, with the dodo
You squares ain't ready for the modern day cholo
Used to be a player, but now
I'm an official
Doin' big thangs like Shine and Pen & Pixel
The only nigga with a Benz, still on Welfare
No insurance, no license, and no
Health care
Computer illiterate, smoke dank like a cigarette
A straight fuckin' idiot
You think that I give a shit
I need a hearing aid for some handicap parkin'
"Damn, Baby Bash, you're so
Damn retarded"

Repeat Chorus
