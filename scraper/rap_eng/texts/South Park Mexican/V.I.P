[South Park Mexican:]
V.I.P. baby
Uh
The room's kinda foggy, ballin' is a hobby
She said I like your style, I told her it was doggy
More champagne & more white wine
She had a gold chain that looked just like mine
Now you might find my life hard to believe
I hop in my Jeep & holla talkin' is cheap
Where my keys homeboy? I snatch 'em from the Valet
It's pourin' down rain, Rollin down South Main
2:16 when I hit the scene, Pull up at After Hours 'about to live my dream
I got the Infra beam wit a 1/5 of Lean, gave the password & a fist of green
Now chiggycheck 1, 2, this one's for you
V.I.P. D.J. jammin' ??? Screw
Surrounded by nudity & private security
My game like cain son, you can taste the purity

Chorus:
It's a private party, at the V.I.P
How many players wanna be like me?
Drinks on the house, put it on my tab
We 3 young players just actin' bad
In the GS Lex, or the SF6
Order ??? & some Thai while I'm hittin' my licks
So just pass the Kill & pop the Dom
At the V.I.P. baby, once again it's on

Say where my players at? Where my players at?
Uhhh sippin' on yaer wit the gangsta hat uhhh
Blowin' on trees Puffin' on a fat uhhh
Player made paper now it's on like that
Lookin' at my Cartier, I thinks it's time
Platinum strapped to my wrist, Diamonds 'about to make me go blind
When I step throught the door better watch yo' girl 'fore I make that hoe mine
I've been a Mack since way back, my Zodiac the Doller Sign
In time, you'll find me too clever, however
Give me a hard headed broad, I'll change her like the weather
Give me a broke legged frog, I'll make it jump forever
Give me some crack & some bars & I'll make plenty cheddar
Pimpin' ain't easy, but somebody's gotta do it
Conversation ain't nothin' lest your willin' to pursue it
If you gon' do it, you better stay true to it
Man pimpin' ain't dead, you just new to it

Chorus:
It's a private party, at the V.I.P
How many players wanna be like me?
Drinks on the house, put it on my tab
We 3 young players just actin' bad
In the GS Lex, or the SF6
Order ??? & some Thai while I'm hittin' my licks
So just pass the Kill & pop the Dom
At the V.I.P. baby, once again it's on

[Pancho Villa:]
Girl we're V.I.P. Very Important People
Mr. Pancho V & Tommy G
With yo' mami's all up under me
So we slidin' in the Beamer or the GS3
Highly scouted pro player, Never been a hater
Congratulater, Don't get mad when I take her
& break her, to the woman that you could not make her
Known for pullin' top notch models, Sex with all the gatos
Well paid vatos, Never had the same O's
Always down to share hoes & after the club
I'm in the Tahoe, where all the girl's follow
All ya'll look good, which one of ya'll gon' swallow?
Gucci on my eyes, diamantes on my teeth
Dimples in my cheeks, Hydroponic in my leaf
Lookin' hella good like every player should
Paper come from wood, but I come from hood

Chorus & out

It's a private party, at the V.I.P
How many players wanna be like me?
Drinks on the house, put it on my tab
We 3 young players just actin' bad
In the GS Lex, or the SF6
Order ??? & some Thai while I'm hittin' my licks
So just pass the Kill & pop the Dom
At the V.I.P. baby, once again it's on
