[Three Minutes and Fourteen Seconds of an instrumental]

Yo man, a nigga gotta say SOMETHIN' to this track man
I hate to interrupt y'all boys freestyle
But we do it like this:

First (and only) Verse:

Muthafucka lay back
In your cadillac
Let me jump in your trunk like back to back
Stay real for life, roll down South
Fixin' to wreck shop for the home town crowd
My alias, be that South Park Mexican
Flowin' through your veins like medicine
You got freestyle?  Wanna be down?
Real ballers, fight for the rebound
G-Town, to muthafuckin' B-Town
Creep around, everybody G'd out
I can't see how, you could take me out
I'll "PEEYOW" and make a dog "Meow"
Deep South, my hood got more slack
Than 88 cowboys ridin' on horseback
Top that, ha, the Mexican's all that
Strike like a snake and attack like a Bobcat
Like Capone on the microphone
You be me and leave that pipe alone boy

Huh....
H-Town represent, and we can do it like this...
Or we can do it like that....
Much love
