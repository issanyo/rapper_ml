[Verse 1]
This is your muthafuckin drug on brains
Feel the dope that I cook, let it rush your veins
Let it blow your mind, she gives a toast of wine
Then she pops two pills and then snorts a line
Inside she cries, Outside she smiles
Fucked up in the head, she was just a child
Started off with coolers and then to buddah
Now she wanna play the flute, I mean the strait shooter
In the ’83 Cougar, lost in the Bermuda
A Muthafucking …
Fucking for Azucar, Snow, Suga, Pearl White
It’s a muthafuckin fucked up world right
That’s what she said, that’s what I heard
Then she fell out and brown hair hit the curb
She didn’t die though
But the ambulance came
It was a miscarriage caused by crack cocaine

[Chorus]
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a Dope Fiend
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a muthafuckin Dope Fiend

[Verse 2]
Fly like a Seagle
Take the gat out the regale
Fuck carry by 6
I’ll be facing judge Ito
In the middle of the crowd bangin UGK
We was all at the Kappa
Year 2YK
I Got a Pocket Full of Stones was the song that was on
It was me in Hillwood, niggas from my home
I went to Worthin and my brother went to Jones
And we was known for selling fried sticks and stones
Ice Cream cones, no fronts or loans
With a fine ass broad out the Yellowstone
Man the trunk was bangin
And my nuts was hangin
I was smoking that rain, wetter than a Penguin
My brain was trippin, sippin Purple lipton
Everybody knew my Gal cause that bitch be strippin
She hit the Fry and got but ass naked
I walked away and let 100 niggas take it

[Chorus]
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a Dope Fiend
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a muthafuckin Dope Fiend

[Verse 3]
Mysteries Mysteries, Dickory Dock
If a bitch come to my house she gon’ sweep and mop
She gon’ wash the dishes, make my food delicious
When I sleep
She say my trigger finger twitches
I’m superstitious and I believe in ghost
Sometimes I wear my dead homeboy’s clothes
Sometimes I hear weird voices at night, I turn on the light
Is that you Mike?
Sometimes I wanna go kill your ex slut cause I know that’s the bitch that set you up
Left in cold blood
Lying in the Living Room
That was the last day life had given you
Love is Blind
People make mistakes
Sometimes you put your trust in frauds and fakes
You bought her a diamond ring
And wrapped it on a puppy
But you can’t satisfy a junkie

[Chorus]
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a Dope Fiend
These are the stories of the things I saw
I wouldn’t wish this life upon none of yall
A reflection
Of all the fuckin shit I’ve seen
Once a Prom Queen, Now a muthafuckin Dope Fiend
