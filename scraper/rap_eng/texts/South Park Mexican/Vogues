[Intro: SPM]
No uh, no...This is my last one (Yes)--how much time we got?
Sometimes when I say something about drugs real loud I seem--haha
Like last time it was heroin and methadone, every time I said that--hahaha

[Verse 1: SPM]
In my Hummer with a tiger, chrome on the wiper
Fired my receptionist cause she a slow typer
Candy green Viper, with the white striper
Choppin' down Scott, slicer and dicer
Keep my wrist iced up, just like my white cup
Ass on the tight buck, bought Pop a nice truck
Bang, Spice 1, round my neck a python
Pack a four pound "do you wanna die" gun
Puff like a dragon, slab Cadillac Brougham
Stack cash in the back of a crack home
Wreck 'em till the outro, show em' how the south go
Hoes on the down low, feed my dog Alpo
No blue or red that's leaving fools dead
Bang gray tapes and listen to what Screw said
Tr√© to the Clarke, back to the South Park
Have you ever seen a nigga jus' freak a Skylark?

[Hook: SPM]
Ride, ride, ridin' on them vogues, fa sho mayne, we gon'
Crawl, crawl, crawlin' on them vogues fa sho mayne

[Verse 2: SPM]
I was a neighborhood drug dealer
Hillwood high life fuckin' blood spilla
In it for the money and not much else
Picked up a pen and I struck wealth
I was travelin' to different cities, different hoods
Sometimes in arenas, sometimes in the woods
Met a lot of fans I never knew had
I get lil gifts and I give 'em to dad
He puts 'em in a room with all my old trophies
Things he looks at cause he ain't got no stories
Of me growin up as a kid on Coral Street
He left to the store and now we're four deep
Came back ten years later
"Mom there's a man outside, is he a neighbor?..
..He said he lived in our house a long time ago.."
"That's your dad, son, I guess he's back from Stop N Go"

[Hook: SPM]
Ride, ride, ridin' on them vogues, fa sho mayne, we gon'
Crawl, crawl, crawlin' on them vogues fa sho mayne

[Verse 3: SPM]
Change out the couches, doesn't buy ounces
So I had to open up seven Dope Houses
Cadillac bounces, started makin' thousands
Draped up in 3 thousand dolla outfits
Everybody happy, laws tryina trap me
Pissed cause I quit and started comin' up rapping
Higher than some scaffolding, sipping, laughing
Stayin' on my toes like them hoes that be tapping
I'm a gambler, neighborhood camper
In my jag trippin' out on Zoolander
Play fastball but I move kinda slow
With some lil' freaks , y'all must be from Idaho
I think I'm from Ohio, cause I'm kinda high-o
I'm a role model but I ain't gon' lie though
Killin brain cells, really isn't cool
That's why I'm gon' quit in 2052, hah

[Outro/Hook: SPM]
Yup...that's me...blowin weed with my grandpa watchin' uhh...yo..

[humming] Creep n Crawl, crawl, on them eighty fo's, fa sho mayne, rollin round, round, on them killa vogues, fa sho mayne, creep n crawl, crawl, on them 84s...
