[South Park Mexican:]
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Still I got thump like the boy Carmine
Hold the block down in my camouflage suit
Stomp when I walk & I'm stackin' all loot
Bling in my mouth but I can take it out
Steppin' up to me, somethin' people think about
Long & hard 'til they lose courage
Mad cause they girl beat up the malnourished
Picked up a star & she spunt 2 nights
Chilled at my crib watchin' Kung Fu fights
Swang & I swung from the Houston
Bet I go hard with no interruption
Woodgrain wheel with the big daddy grill
Higher than a hill in my automobile
And we roll thick, takin' no shit
45 on hip with the hollow point tip

[Chorus: South Park Mexican] [x2]
We're comin' gangsta & gangsta's how we come
We're comin' gangsta & wreckin' for Houston

[Powda:]
Break it down, watch me clown I'm a break'em off
Can't fuck with this Mexican Bitch from the South
Under oath keep it true at all times
Love smokin' weed & I love bustin' rhymes
Fine dime, stay fly keep it tight like a rubber
Just fuck'em, don't love'em, like my shit undercover
'Cause I'm a Hustla, gettin' mine by any means
Don't be surprised, I ain't quiet 'bout where the green
I like, I need, so that's how it be
You can hit it or quit it, believe I will proceed
Next, soon as I put cess in my chest
I forget, I ain't got time, got this record to wreck
My interest, myself & gettin' for me
So I just ain't the of type of chick you'll be hittin' for free
Comin' gangsta, better believe & respect
Me & that boy S.P. reppin' Houston Tex

[Chorus: South Park Mexican] [x2]
We're comin' gangsta & gangsta's how we come
We're comin' gangsta & wreckin' for Houston

[South Park Mexican:]
Yo, it's the boy Los in a smoke gray 'Lac
Forever be puttin' Hillwood on the map
Rollin' with 10 pounds of steel on my lap
I'm a let you know that I stay about that
Popped up pretty in a screwed up city
Might come Puerto Rican broad like Diddy
Might come Arabian or Venezuelan
'Mote control radio, 84 swangin'
Mix the drank up, pour it in my dang cup
My girl on the phone trippin' so I hang up
Playboy status, man it's hard to break habits
Go through mo' cabbage than a pack of damn rabbits
2 cella-tels, million record sales
See your boys puttin' caine in your nostrills
I rock Philly's, my 'Lac pop wheelies
Now I'm locked up with a dude that robbed Chillies

[Chorus: South Park Mexican] [x2]
We're comin' gangsta & gangsta's how we come
We're comin' gangsta & wreckin' for Houston
