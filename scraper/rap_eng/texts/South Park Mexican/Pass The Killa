(Riley speaking)
Pass the sin semilla
Yes we smoke it every hour.....

Chorus
Pass the killa from the left hand side
Pass the chronic from the left hand
Many people come around tryin to smoke my weed
But don't, don't stand so close to me(x2)
Pass the Ganja from the left hand side
Pass the sensi from the left hand side
We smoke

(BabyBeesh)
Well now we smokin sticky green bomb
That killa weed mon
It's BabyBeesh and MaryJane
We get our freak on
The words I'm speakin
I don't be jokin from Vallejo, Califas to Houston, Tejas
Coughin and chokin
Here a splif, there a splif
Everywhere a splif joint
And I've been high everyday
Up til this point, in my life
Mary Jane if you could be my wife
I'd sacrifice and make love to you everynight
See you're so wet and you're so fluffy
Light green and lovely
I roll you up and kissy kissy
Now sucky sucky
Maria who? Oh!
MariaJuana I swear to God
I love you much more than my baby's mama mama

Chorus

(SPM)
I smoke ganja in the Dope Casa
It's the Raza, down with the Rasta
Father God, creator of the Earth
Thank you for the Mary that grows from ya dirt
Take my first hit in blow my first hit out
Do the hokey smokey til I'm floatin in the clouds
I'm in Jamaica, higher than a skyscraper
She's my lady. I'll never let nobody take her
Alert the soldiers, she just got kidnapped
Call big Swisha and the killa cousin ZigZag
Squash the chit-chat, I've never been with that
Riley grab the big gat.....I need my chick back

Chorus

(SPM)
I got the money, who got the gummy
Sticky green honey got me feeling like dummy?
She keeps me hungry so I'm just a bit chubby
But that's okay, 'cuz I know that she loves me
I'm lucky, 'cuz she makes everything funny
Divorced Snow White' cuz she kept mi nose runny
But now I'm happy, Mary never slapped me
Her red hair is nappy, but it tastes like candy
Sometimes she's Hawaiian, sometimes she's Mexican
Sometimes she's from Taiwan or even sweet Jamaican
I love MaryJane in any shape or form
You can catch us kissin deep in the quiet storm

Chorus and out
