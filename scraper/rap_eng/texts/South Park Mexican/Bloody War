[Verse 1 SPM]
We heard the word now we know just what your thinking
You want us dead now you wanna see us sinking
We have no choice now this is the game you've chosen
My clique is killer, just like the dank im smoking
Its time for action time for retalliation
You ain't a real G been watching too much Jason
Ball my fist around clips, may you sleep in peace with the fish
You's a ho and in the pen you be a bitch using red m&m's for lipstick

They want to come to bloody war
Are you sure you want to take me to war

[Verse 2 SPM]
I got my G's I got my team
Put me down for murder in 1st degree
My clip is full but that'll change
Heard you got your vest on but I want brains
These lonely days and lonely nights
Cause I need my revenge right by my side
My gun is hot my heart is cold
Every one around me has killed before

[Verse 3 SPM]
I snatched your bitch then snatched your life
And keep your fingers from bragging rights
Next week you'll be washing my troca cus your ass ain't shit but a panocha
You got a choice die or be miserable no vowels homie the invisible
I warned you all to stay of my genetiles now I gotta turn you fruits into vegetebales
Having nightmare homie you ain't dead yet waking up with your muthafucken bed wet
I have fun with fucken punks like you tell his momma not to worry he'll be dead by 2
His head impounded the never found it he in the dirt you could say he got grounded
I'mma shout it live it how I tell it and if u see him tell him I said
