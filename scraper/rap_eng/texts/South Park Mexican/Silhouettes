[South Park Mexican:]
Yo, Blowin' on a sack of flight, buildin' up my appetite
See my homies eatin' & I be like "Can I have a bite?"
Last night I had a fight, after that I grabbed the mic
When the club closed I went home on my granny's bike
People was laughin' like "Look he just ran the light"
I just kept pedalin' I didn't get mad or gipe
Sell that rock & the pipe, G 'til my afterlife
Let me get on stage, bet I say the things that ya like
Higher than a dragonfly, I'm a make math or die
Been a pimp since that group that I was in with Glady's Knight
Mostly I be packin' 9's, have you pushin' dandelions
Come short with my cash you be dancin' like is Hammer Time
Yeah I'm lost & I'm blind, still I'm gon' handle mine
Have your homey leakin' cause he bumpin' mo' than camel spines
In the hood I vandalize, land of fiends & baggy eyes
Where you can make a killin' & don't even have to advertise

[Chorus:]
Silhouettes, crack pipes at night, then you see the jumbo lighter strike
Thug stories of a violent life, smoke once & you will try it twice
What the fuck else am I to do? I wanna be rich & buy a zoo
Maybe just a candy 5 or 2 & tell my daughter I would die for you. [x2]

[South Park Mexican:]
Can't switch Never Change nothin' for the radio
You don't have to play me hoe, I'm a still make my dough
I been sellin' albums since '92 & '93
They would either call me for a tape or a quoter key
For the dream, for the team, can't nobody hang with Los
Battle me, I'm like "Man at least try to make it close"
M.C. Tortura-rap game Sorcera
Ya'll remember when I did it on that song "Warriors"
That was maybe '95 with the Most Hated group
All my enemies heard my voice & it made 'em puke
Ever since I hit the street, I been on a hittin' streak
Straight from the gutter. Would you like to take a little peek?
Simple T & dicky shorts, on the cut wit cold quarts
No time to go home, cook it with a blow torch
Old men on the porch watchin' boys come'n go
Life is a prison risk in the midst of runnin' slow

[Chorus:]
Silhouettes, crack pipes at night, then you see the jumbo lighter strike
Thug stories of a violent life, smoke once & you will try it twice
What the fuck else am I to do? I wanna be rich & buy a zoo
Maybe just a candy 5 or 2 & tell my daughter I would die for you. [x2]

[South Park Mexican:]
Hustle slow or hustle fast, cages for who love the cash
Others in a burried hole, no one really understands
Trouble lands where it may, death is never choosy
If I try to ask 'why' this shit'll just confuse me
Don't lose me, just hold tight, I know is gettin' deep again
Call me when you need dope nigga I don't need a friend
I been on a hustle since I started cuttin' people yards
Then I started noticin' the rims on these people cars
Hope that they sleepin' hard when I come back tonight
Next thing you know I'm stoppin' hard at a traffic light
Jammin' Ike, radio was programmed to oldies
Waitin' on the green light so that I can go please
A/C with cold breeze, blowin' on a Optimo
I could reach the pedal better if I had a longer toe
Stop at the Stop'N'Go, I ain't got no gas money
So I pump the gas first & holla "Pay your back buddy!"

[Chorus:]
Silhouettes, crick pipes at night, then you see the jumbo lighter strike
Thug stories of a violent life, smoke once & you will try it twice
What the fuck else am I to do? I wanna be rich & buy a zoo
Maybe just a candy 5 or 2 & tell my daughter I would die for you. [x2]
