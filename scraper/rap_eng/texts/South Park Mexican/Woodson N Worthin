[Intro]
Yeah just erase everything let me do this huh
This is damm Filero this is damm Filero
He on the mothafucken what sobrero
The bake hood bring me some bake
Hey Filero pull up bass in this song
Man i dont hear no bass ok
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Here we go man

[Verse 1]
Smoke on the kill popped up on three wheel
Want another pill naw nigga I'ma chill
Gone off the X its the SP-Mex
Just made 2 twenty-thousand dollar bets
Hoes wanna speak nah I need a freak
I be freestyle flowing in my sleep
Out to Hous-tone that's my dam home
I like to get high I need a bowl of Honeycomb
Man put em up man I can't quit
I need a forty and a forty cigarette
Down for my raza mira lo que pasa
When it get hot I'ma have to buy a raspa
Maybe horchata check my palabras
I like girls with the real pretty patas
Ima throw vato back to chase gato
SPM mean South Park Mojado
1 in a billion V-12 engine
In the same city with Destiny's Children
I'm off the rocka peace to Lil' Papa
I be the shit, in Spanish I'm the caca
I'ma take a picture of your butt naked sister
And my killas got more priors then Richard
Gangsta gangsta read all about it
22 holes in ya' brand new outfit
Feestyle flow is all I come with
I don't give a fuck ya'll stupid dumb bitch
In the land of g's smoking QP's
Smoke on kill I'ma smoke trees
Man I get crunked do what with my thang
Swang lang lang in the mothafucking brain
Dumb diddy dum did I did I get dumb
I'ma get my gun I'ma shoot off your thumb
Shoot you in the buns I mean the dam ass
I'ma get a glass and than pull up some rasp
Mothafucking berry with a lil cherry
My mothafuckin niggas is so dam very
So dam very mothafuckin scary
With the mothafucking what what the Dirty Harry
I'ma say hi to my favorite cities
I dont even care if they what little bitty
I get on my knees and I thank the Lord
Whipping boys down with my microphone cord
Swurl to the world diamonds and pearls
All my girls dyke like Laverne and Shirley
Straw to the nose curl up my toes
Selling that cane to them buttnaked hoes
Man I ain't foolish but I do talk to bullets
Better tell ya boys to cool it
Cause I grab it and I pull it man

[Chorus x2]
As I look up at the sky
My eye starts bliking a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin can they break in
Tryin to save a dog

[Verse 2]
Man I put it down I ain't tryin to trip
But I talk shit in the syrup I'ma sip
Peace to Lil' Flip and my big homie Hump
Hillwood Cloverland Sunnyside ain't no pump
Throwed from the jump purple ice in my cup
Man i gotta have it i ain't lying im in love
With the codeine on the Martin Luther King
Left on crest crump creep creep my sterling
Make a hoe sing on on my mothafucken hook
Pyrex get shook I sell dope on foot
Momma understand i'ma Hustling man
Rock the white sand, watch the white van
Get the fuck out if you see em jump out
Undercover cops got their eyes on the south
Just bought a house, never took a loss
Everything I got come from a quarter ounce
That's what i started in the game with
Niggas short stopping at the Botany what Bridge
If they want bricks gotta come to the Hill
Takin' no less than a 10 dolla bill
You can have the three five seven dolla pieces
I'ma dress like a fein no gold and no creases
I got my gun no time for fun
It's Saturday night, slang till i see the sun
Peace To Hulon and the what Tio drinking
In the plut and my nigga Pancho
Ed loco and my boy Jimmy Green
Mothafucken Ken and my brother Ronnie
Man can't you see don't put it past me
Fuck the R-A-P i die for my G
In the Orleans way scott plaza
Woodson n Worthin, patna cause I's a
Hillwood hustla that's my damm click
Where we sell bricks and we like to fight pits
I just had puppies but somebody stole my dogs
Im telling you young niggas i don't call the laws
When i fucken catch you i'ma pistol whip you
Man better ask you older brother and sister
Look what you done I done fell off the subject
Cool water on my Bananan Republic
Man lets hoop at the Cloverland park
Bought my white T from the super k mart
On this damm mic i go so hard
Forty five hundred jolly rancher on my car man

[Chorus x2]
As I look up at the sky
My eye starts bliking a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin can they break in
Tryin to save a dog

[Verse 3: Low-G]
Time to reload shots trough your door
