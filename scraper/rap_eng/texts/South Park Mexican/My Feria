Feria
Feria

Chorus: DJ Kane
I'm in love with my feria
What I would do for my feria
I stay true to my feria
Because my feria loves me

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
I got a fat girl
With a big ol' face
And "In God we trust," tattooed around her waist
Help me beat the dope case and she paid off the judge
I bet her on the Cubs and the Phoenix Suns
Her name is Cashoda, way over Maria
She bought me a casino, in South Korea
How we roll, you have no, oh, idea
She run with hoes like Christina la bolilla
She never bounce like a check, put an ounce in my vet
Got a house and a jet, she my spouse and my friend
Put my cousin through college, and bought my grandma a new ranch
She crazy, always chase me, tryin' to get in my pants (Ha ha)

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
She come from a tree, but she ain't Mary Jane
I'm talkin' 'bout my paper, mayne
Never fake or counterfeit, my Madam Izeal
Bought me snacks up in jail until they grantin' me bail
My jewels
Surround my platinum kazels
She can't spell, but she can sure count well
Records sales, make her swell, bought my first two Quells
My first sound system bangin' "Rock The Bells"
Lock and load, clock and fold
Pockets swoll
Rock and roll, out the door
With pots of gold
Congratulators shoot haters like Space Invaders
So much feria, I bought a swimming pool for my neighbors

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
[Baby Bash]
Now we gon' ride like the wind, my lover, my dividend
She my feri', I'm her daddy, and she, my best friend
Got me spendin' weekends in Kingston, Jamaica
Oooh, my fettucini
Oooh, I love my paper
When she get out of line, papi gon' get on the grind
Facin' penitentiary time, but she's eventually mine
Same color as my hydro
I swear to God
The only bitch I'll ever die for
Or ride for

[Low G]
I go to war, for my peso, my queso
My billetes
Que bella
Te miras como una estrella
The player
El Jugador, el fumador
Todo el mundo sabe los que aria por tu amor
Oye chico
You got my Federico
Pobresito
Now I got to call my primo
El cochino
Suck the blood like Dracula
I'm in the hood, flippin' cookies with my spatula

Repeat Chorus Twice
