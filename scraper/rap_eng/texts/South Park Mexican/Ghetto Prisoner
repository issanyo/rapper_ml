(Chrous x2)
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny incident
To face of death
I'm so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)

(First Verse)
ONE TIME MOTHAFUKA reach for the sky
All I ever wanted was a piece of the pie
On this chrome Microphone
I can Do No Wrong and can only be held
Back
For so long
On the tempo street info
How I riddow
If this nigga trip i turn his bitch
Into a widdow
Puffin weed
5 Dunn Sunny D
Cyber real free shit comin from a G
Suddenly the Summary Ain't where you wanna be
Underneath a hundred G's keepin death company
Quick triiga
Certified wig splitas
Ditch diggaz
All about big figaz
The last to laugh you dont have a chance
I come down like a motha fuckin Avalanche
Blast yo azz you think we won't answer back
Cancel that or we blow yo motha fuckin azz
In half

(Chrous x2)
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny incident
To face of death
I'm so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)

(Verse Two)
We roc Rashade is also gettin paid
Who give us a bald fade
Who got,just razor blades
Wit yo options be away
The game of life'll be to play
Wit five aces of spades
Three small trick up the trade
Radicle renegade
Walked in this world to play
Bringing faces
The top joka
Devil persuasive
Ain't iy amazing hoe this beer became
A cravin add a fukin sweet
Give it tea to see some mis behaving
Ain't no lifting balls
Bitches mind be like ill
Put you down wit these southern skills
Then piss in yo fuckin grill
Grow deep wit back & gats
And all stands
My boyz gettin prepared for neucin
The war fair hands up in the air
Soidlers flippin they fists
Fifty bald heads smoked out
Sloked out of piss
Infarred got it locked my man X
Marks the spot
Drench ,then run that motha fucka
Down the block

(Chrous x2)
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
(my life is violent
But violent is life)
Funny incident
To face of death
I'm so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)
