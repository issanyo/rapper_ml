I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny isnt it
The face of death
Looks so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)

[Verse 1:]
One time mothafuka reach for the sky
All I ever wanted was a piece of the pie
On this chrome Microphone
I could Do No Wrong and can only be held
Back
For so long
Up tempo street info
How I riddle
If a nigga trip I turn his bitch
Into a widow
Puffin weed
Vodka & Sunny D
Sucka free real shit comin from a G
Suddenly the Summary Ain't where you wanna be
Underneath a hundred G's keepin dead company
Quick triggas
Certified wig splitas
Ditch diggaz
All about big figaz
The last to laugh you don't have a chance
I come down like a motha fuckin Avalanche
Blast yo gatz think we won't answer back
Cancel that we blow yo fuckin azz
In half

[Chorus: x2]
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny isnt it
The face of death
Looks so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)

[Verse 2:]
Light brown shade thoughts on gettin paid
Who give us a bald fade
No guards, n razor blades
Future options bein weighed
The game of life is bein playd
With five aces of spades
Three small trick up the trade
Radicle renegade
Walked in this world of blazin
Bringing faces
Touch of the
Devil persuasion
Ain't it amazing how this beer became
A cravin add a fukin sweet
Guarenteed to see some misbehaving
Ain't no lifting balls
Bitches my nuts is real
Put you down with these southern skills
Then piss in yo fuckin grill
Roll deep with bats n gats n hard stares
So hard gettin prepared for nuclear warfare
Hands up in the air soldiers clenching there
Fists 50 bald heads smoked out loced out n pissed
Infared got it locked my bad hop out the spot
Rotten mother fuker down the block

[Chorus: x2]
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny isnt it
The face of death
Looks so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)
Buck buck buck lyrical stylin run to the animosity at high volocity break it down for the nine eight... ready for war we brought attributions put fools in mental institution?
Represent fureal

[Verse 3:]
Cockin my roc-a-bye
Finally it's tyme to give my new Glock a try
Homerun hitta u just poppin flies, talkin lies
Now I come n there be no compromise
Don't sleep son you betta stay awake
The player made gon put ya ass on lay-away
Mayday, mayday it's payday
In the school band I played the ak
It's midnight motherfuck a fist fight
My clip light hoes up quick like
My grip tyte keepin my shit ryte
A hustla my customaz hit pipes
Ya herd of me doin derty deeds
Two quick kick door burglerez
My nigga chief came through with the hip hop
So wen my shit drop your lips be on zip lock

[Chorus: x2]
I can't escape
This ghetto imprisonment
Funny isnt it
The face of death
Looks so innocent
(my life is violent
But violent is life)
