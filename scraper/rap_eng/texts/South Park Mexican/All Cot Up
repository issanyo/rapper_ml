[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I might not know what to say
Rollin' up in my mercury
I'm on the sea and private toys
Momma taught me how to kill them boys
My homeboys name is lil troy
Me, my name is Carlos Coy
Roll on tweenty-two inch alloys
But that'll neva be my pride and joy
My lil girl she off the hook
Make my ass stop and read a book
On her stove know'n how to cook
Now, I know how an angel look
My beauty queen
My billy jean
Some they come right in between
I don't let nobody fuck up my dreams
So, I pack bubble gum machines
Everybody wanna, wanna, wanna be da king
Bitch, get off my ding-a-ling
I'll soak yo ass in gasoline
Now, listen to my fat girl sing

[Chorus: Ayana]
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
Me and my boys we sellin weed
Still, I gotta slang that pappy seed
Snatch yo bitch and rock her G
Now, bitch get yo ass of a me
Kick her out my fuckin room
Now, they waken me up at noon
Fuck that shit i'll take my time
I ain't leave till three-o-nine
Hold up maan, now stop the lac
I think I forgot my bom-bom sack
With my homeboy Lonny Mack
I'mma smoke till I have a uhh, cardiac
Where my army at, stay on attack
One good shot and we all react
I smell a rat, so I feed the cat
Me be cool? Oh, neva that
My chedda's fat
I'll get the gat
Both of my pockets hella fat
I'mma democrat
What the hell is that?
Take my shit, betta mail it back

[Chorus: Ayana]
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
When does the fucken verse come in
He's all cot uuuup

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
Screwston, Texas were I roam
Bought me home off a telephone
Took my wife on a trip to Rome
And bought girlfriend silicone
That vanilla bone In the killa zone
Five-foot-nine with high heellas on
I sipp patron, flip my phone
Left that pearl white bitch alone
Most of my friends ain't around
Dead, locked up, or just can't be found
I keep my lil girl safe and sound
Daddy gonna buy a Cinderella gown
And if that gown should disappear
Heaven is real but it isn't here
You can't take no souvenirs
Like those diamonds in your ears
Raised my daughter differently
Cause the life I lived won't set me free
Write my list of enemies a
And kill them hoes alphabetically
Uuhh

[Outro/Chorus: Ayana]
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
Ay, all, he's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
He's all cot up
