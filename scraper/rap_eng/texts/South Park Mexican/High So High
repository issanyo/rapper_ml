[South Park Mexican (Marilyn Rylander in background)]
(Verse 1)
I'm a roll '84's til them hoes start clackin'
Put 'em on they bang, got 'em askin', "What happened?" (What happened)
Homie was crackin', it's good to be back
See me on the slab in a beautiful 'Llac
If you wanna jack
I got somethin' for you
Caught another case, so I gotta call my lawyer
Got a fine chick that look just like LaToya
And I bet fifty G's on my boy, De La Hoya
Tryin' to stay free with the loot they pay me
Boy, I'm a vet
And you still a trainee
Ballin' daily with my green lady
She asked him what have I done for her lately
I'm a Dog like Scrappy, my girl tried to slap me
Caught her by the hand and told her, "Don't get happy" (Don't get happy)
Still sport Khakis, got the savvy yola
Mister High Roller, movin' Coca Cola
While I stay

Chorus:
[Marilyn] High so high
Reachin' for the sky
[SPM] Reachin' for the sky
[Marilyn] High so high
Please don't blow my high
[SPM] Please don't blow my high

(Verse 2)
I feel off the wagon, Dickies still saggin'
Blow more smoke than Puff, the Dragon (Dragon)
Choppin' big thangs, but you never hear me braggin'
Pick your chick up, and it's gonna be a stabbin
Haters get mad and don't want my autograph
Let me hear you rap, man, I promise not to laugh {*Marilyn laughing*}
Walked the wrong path when I went and bought a half
Sold out, on the cut, now it's time to call a cab
Stop at Timmy Chan's for the wings and rice
Then to the store, I need a forty and some dice
What they hittin' for, come out with Little Joe
Can you play five hundred on a what
Ten or four
Let 'em go, let 'em go
Boys start leavin'
Hillwood hustler
Never caught sleepin'
Bobbin' and weavin', still block bleedin'
Ain't gonna quit til you haters stop breathin'
And I stay

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Who said money didn't grow on trees
I came up slangin' them cocoa leaves
Many stories 'bout territories
At the Dope House, we don't call the police
Feel a cold breeze when I get below freeze
I got no love for you studio G's (No love)
I buy four Jeeps and I wear a gold leash
But what the hell is money if you got no peace
Homies in the back, and they ready to attack
And we don't go to clubs where you can't wear your hat
Homie where you at, represent, where you from
Land of dum-dum, where you don't dare to come (Where you come)
All you jealous boys is tryin' to destroy us
I run you out my city like the Tennessee Oilers
Got nothin' for us
Listen to my chorus
While I sit back and blaze up a damn forest
Stayin' so

Repeat Chorus Twice {with variations}

[South Park Mexican (Marilyn Rylander)]
Ha ha
Mr. SPM
Uh (Hey)
And you know it don't stop (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
For all my player partners (High so)
Dope House baby (High so, I'm so, high)
We don't quit, hun
We ain't goin' nowhere (Yeah)
{*Marilyn harmonizing*}
