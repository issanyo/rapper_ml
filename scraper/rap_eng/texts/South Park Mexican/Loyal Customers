Nah don't shoot 'em there, hit 'em in the back bone
'Cause he picks & he whispers behind my back

[Rasheed:]

They intrigued by the way you cook yo' dope

[South Park Mexican:]
There's no cut so they hooked on Los
Not only in the free world but in the pen

[Rasheed:]
You fuckin' haters wanna hide while I count to 10

[Rasheed:]
Philosophy a G livin' quite simple
Blast upon instinct bust 'em in the temple

[South Park Mexican:]

Tonight you got engagements to meet with the dead

[South Park Mexican:]

Yo Los you know why we move from area to area?

[South Park Mexican:]

[Rasheed:]

'Cause the muthafuckin' rap game is 'about to get break

With 300 pounds & a king size bed
Won't brag or boast but here's a toast
To the whole world with they eyes on the 3rd coast

[Rasheed:]
I feel like I gotta break these nigga's off somethin'
Double pumpin' off the body dumpin'
Movado on wrist livin' minute by minute
Your bitch nigga’s need to stop it how you live it

[South Park Mexican:]
Tryin' to murder me in the first degree
University of eternity
But personally I celebrate our anniversary
'Cause your blood in my trunk & turned to burgundy

[Rasheed:]

3 hollow tips & a grenade in the sofa
Purple scultpa I'm a murder coach cha
Killer’s blowin' Doja in the dumble with my…
