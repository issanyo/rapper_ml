[Intro]
It's your boy SPM Y'all
And You know as i sit up in this cell
I Think to my self
I'm really blessed man
I get so much love and i got to thank you for that
So you know
That's what I'm gonna do
Yo cuz you mean the world to me
You help feed my family
Help clothe my children
And all i do
All I do is flow
The flow i do
Haha check me out

[Verse 1]
It's the boy Los blowing kill with my hood
Fire up another one this for Hillwood
Dropping new hits the hell does he do it
Flowing in my 8 by 12 sippin fluids
Let's ride in the wind keep my chin high
In the middle of the struggle but we gonna get by
Mamasita don't cry the whole world hold us
Even haters online while trying to download us
No pain no glory write a love story
Whether it's the new song or another 40
Buddy when I jump on the Mic it's magic
Bill Gates money up inside this tablet
So much love and the mail they handed me
Fans are my family friends was a fantasy
Everything clear let the silent live on
About time I wrote a motherfucking positive song

[Hook]
Nigga came up and they said I couldn't do it
Now I am selling out stores staying true to it
Even from a prison I ball like a rocket
Motherfuckers steady tripping because just can't stop it

[Verse 2]
Mary Jane love me Mary Jane hold me
No one do it better that what Mary Jane told me
I already knew that what about you
Back feel like I'm rolling 84s on a new lack
Ride with a G please don't burn the seat
Sipping all day mouth full of purple teeth
Roll perfectly no my blunt is flimsy
But I would not retired like Spuds McKenzie
Some are stingy but I'm not that way
I used to share my 40 ounce with my homeboy Dre
Not the one that's all famous man yeah y'all be tripping
I'm talking about the Dre That works at churches kitchen
This is my hood we don't claim no sets
But the streets are alive and the game don't rest
So I stay on my toes still able to smile
A brand-new year man I made it somehow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This a song for the single a song for the married
A song for the moms and the babies that they carry
I'm far from the preacher far from the teacher
This is just to tell you that I love you and I need you
So many memories so many pains
It's funny how I used it all up for my games
That's why I tell you if you're going through a storm
Don't trip God uses pain to make people strong

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah this for you baby
Pocos Pero Locos
My nigga E-Dub
My baby Kool-Aid all my love ones
This a family affair man
This how do it H-Town H-Town
My beautiful wife, my babies, my beautiful Fans
