[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
The Dope House, got it snowin' in the summer
Drug runner, fuck the "I'm-a-gonna-wanna"
Fast learner, attack like piranah
My next big hit's called "Hubba, Hubba, Hubba"
I smoke her cause I love her bought a Danny Glover
Now I'm burnin' rubber in somebody baby mother
I'm from the gutter, diggin' in your trash can
Fuckin' with my niggas, it'll be your last dance
I came up off the cut buyin' 'Llacs and trophy trucks
The only thing I sell is smokable products
In my all white chucks turn a man into dust
You wanna meet the devil, huh, you in a bad rush
I'm a keep a smile, I was born the crack child
Got the rap game shinin' up my reptiles
Make your ears ring when I sting like a scorpion
Pronounce him dead by 4 P.M
Call me Los Kevorkian (Kevorkian...)

[Hook 2x: Ayana M]
Some do it for the money and fame
He just don't wanna sell no more 'caine
Now his flow is a beautiful thang
SPM, he's a bird, he's a plane

[Verse 2]
In Hillwood (In Hillwood...)
We didn't have many choices
I'm hearin' noises outside, I hear voices
The Coys is a family who didn't have much
Except the love of a single mother's touch
The lust of money, had me slangin' 'caine and weed
I was first on the block and last to leave
Feel the rain as it falls on this, tricky game
Breakin' 'caine, clear your sinuses like liquid drain
Lift my name, guess my pain is used
To entertain a simple thing in every city seems like
Shit's the same, born loser, V-12 cruiser
I opened up a store for the common drug user
Thirty-six eggs come from each chicken
Some of you ain't livin', fuckin' with the unforgiven
I'm wishin' I could hug those dead or in prison
They go to jail or hell, just because it's free admission
Man

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
Five on the dot when I hit the crack spot
Thirty slab rocks in a little matchbox
Ho ass cops hit the cut around seven
Caught a fiend with the pipe and arrested him for resin
Fuckin' pigs want me so bad, they can taste it
But you bitches gonna have to settle for a base hit
Cause I don't slip, roll quick, abandon ship
Rap a platinum hit make the police captain sick
Back street legends the world feel my prescence
I'm the first man to touch it when the dope gets to Texas
You can keep the Lexus cause I bought two Benzes
On the microphone, I break you off with one sentence
Stay aware for what's out there, I smell hate all in the air
They asked me what my race was I told them it was "Player"
A very rare breed, almost extinct
The way I walk, the way I think
The shit I wear, the shit I drink
The way I stink I smell like fruity hydroponic
When haters see my car they turn around and vomit
I'm loco, fuck any player hatin' joto
You ain't got no love for me
I ain't got no love tan poco (Poco...)
