[Verse 1: SPM]
Fresh off the cut, mama who? mama what?
Take a 40-ounce hard to the gut
On the run so call me the perro
In the club with a sharp ass filero
Ya'll gettin large, Dopehouse is larger
I'm in the hotel tryin to find my charger
Its another hot summer, she gave me the peck
And then let me tongue her
Love it maan, I'm with my dame
Young and dumb with real good brains
In the club eatin steak and ostrich
Smoke weed and get more hungry than a hostage
I've been hard since the very first demo
We came up with no problemo
Darn, yeah I'm from a farm
With 700 elbows in the barn!

[Hook]
Do you party with those drug smugglers?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba

Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
Do you love your homies like a brother?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba

[Verse 2: Baby Beesh]
Man these fools dont wanna see me
Smoked out like an Indian chiefy
With Pocahantas and her cousin in my teepee
Talkin bout how they love some Baby Beeshi
While I'm suckin on a sweet like a chi-chi
So high, everything lookin 3D
Threesome, got your boy Little Freaky
Orgys to the weewee, the sleepy
But I'm just sayin though
Wiggy, Wiggy, outsmart the piggy
Them Dopehouse boys bout them bones like Bizzy
I'm a grizzly, so call me the Oso
Pushin that candy, vanilla and a cocoas
Ojos, green like your mocos
Plum dumb stupid and plum dumb baboso
If you dont wanna give me no love
Check it out maan I dont give a HUH!

[Hook]
Do you smoke like a broke muffler?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
Are you a 40-ounce chug-a-lugga?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
Is your favorite actor Danny Glover?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
Do you smoke a sweet then smoke another?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba

[Verse 3: Rasheed]
The wetblack, back from hell (yo)
Fresh off the motherfuckin crack hotel (Uh-huh)
The young nigga, knock-a knock a nigga out quick (POP!)
Ya'll heard a new jam called "We bout sick" (Hehe)
With the mexicans, sippin on medicine (Yeah)
I accidently shot an innocent pedestrian (AAH!)
Devilish, got my hand on a ruga (Click-Clack)
Pushin me will havin you pushin the patunias
Look at all these rumors, surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away
Let me crush, my king still pendin (Still pendin)
Benzo plus, 600 engine
But the cops put my car in the storage (Why?)
Traffic warrants, I'm in jail eatin porridge

[Hook]
Do you understand or did I stutter?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
Did you raise up out the fuckin gutter?
Hubba, Hubba, Hubba
