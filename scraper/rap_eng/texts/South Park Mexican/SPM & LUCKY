When I slide, 'bout to bring this heavy and cold. tryna to reach for my piece, ok ready, unload. and so many been told but got no sense to listen. walk away from the fire that's your best decision. so many souls have risen, so many holes have been dug. so many mothers have fainted, now pick her up off the rug and take her out of the room. don't let her look at the body because she still can't believe that her son is inside 'em. I'm tryin to cope with the laws and put my hope in the cross. I remember all the times, walkin' broke through the malls. no love for the browsers so I opened up houses. moved ups and downs I'm the company founder. my weed was browner but now it's greenish and bluish. on the streets I was learnin with the rest of the students. no scholarship and it felt like graduation was hell. he wanted a dime so I broke a twenty using my nail. soy el coyote del monte you know that boy. el nombre famoso me llamo CARLOS COY. el jefe de la compania dope house records. I done wreck you niggas once, now I'm comin for seconds and the jealous of my stepping stones building my dynasty. all the hate makes me stronger bitch you cannot silence me. we all about pluses catching hydro busses. I'm the truest why you think the fukin whole world love us. the life of a thousand men if you ain't a friend of mine I step to the niggas and they like uh neva mind. never been afraid to die, so I pray the day that I leave you'll forgive me if I don't get a chance to say goodbye. G till my after life hillwood mastermind dope sells itself we don't even have to advertise

[Powda:]
Let me have the last verse, I promise not to curse. And homie you don't have to be scared to go to church. Fuck a bitch that would ever disrespect God's house. Ohh, I promise not to curse Jaime, block that one out. My baby's in prison so it's just hard to breathe, I got a bible but I can't find what part to read. my eyes start to bleed, lord is dark indeed. they tryna sue us, and it's just another shark to feed. still Los is the king and Dope still sell itself but I got that kind of pain, pain pills don't' help. tryna stack my stack but it's so hard to make it. like that one bitch he saying it's so complicated. put my life on the path, it could be happy or sad. you got a saying, if you got my name I might ask for a drag. so wish me the best or wish me the worst. if I curse, it just be another freestyle verse
