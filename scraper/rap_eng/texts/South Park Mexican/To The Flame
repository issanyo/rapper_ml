Verse 1:
Some say I'm disturbed, but I don't care to change
That my music ain't positive, it shares my pain
I'm sorry but it's therapy, I try to do it carefully
What the fuck ya'll want, 6 relatives to carry me?
Do you want the air I breathe, damn dawg apparently
Just cuz you got a gun, life isn't guaranteed
Bitches I will bury thee, this is not a new job
I been diggin' holes, since Humpty found 2Pac
Since dad drove that blue Dodge, the one that fuckin' Raymond wrecked
We was gettin' shot at, I told that fool to take a left
Had to jump out and start runnin' like a bitch
I still don't understand how that motherfucker missed
This nigga was a friend, but that wet took his brain
He tried to murder me and get me sent to the flames
Why I didn't have my gun, only Heaven knows
Cuz if I woulda had it, Dear God rest his soul

Hook [Carolyn Rodriguez] (2x):
Packin 45's, murder multiplies
Now the homie dies, layin' there with open eyes
Hope his soul arrives, but we know the price
To the flame, cuz the game is as cold as ice

Verse 2:
Later that night, my nigga Jay came by
Said he heard the dude say he purposely ain't high
"Los, the nigga was wet, and I know that you agg
But it's prison if you go and put that hoe in a bag"
I said, "The story don't end until it runs on the news
Shit, we all smoke fry that ain't no fuckin' excuse!"
When his momma start screamin' that it wasn't his time
Guess I'd rather be it his than it comin' from mine
Then after that discussion, I hopped in my ride
45 to my side, took the lock off the nine
My brother found out and started callin' my chick
Then Gina called my cell phone and started to trip
Uh

Hook(2x)

Verse 3:
I said, "look, baby doll this is the game"
When the bullets flew by, I heard 'em whistle my name
And mami I'm sorry, for the time invested
But don't forget, a while back, what I suggested
When you told me you loved me, I said I loved you too
But I peel wigs back like a sunroof do
And I'm so fuckin' lost in a hustla's world
Plus I smoke so damn much, I bet my nuts are sterile
And the streets are callin', you can't stop whats destined."
She said, "Fine, but there's somethin' I forgot to mention."
It was only 3 words, but they changed me that second
She took a deep breath and said, "Baby I'm pregnant"

Hope his sould arrives, but we know the price
