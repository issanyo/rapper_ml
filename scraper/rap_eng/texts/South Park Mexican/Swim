I was three when my old man left in the wind
Pushed me in the ocean, turned around and said swim
That's what I did even though I was scared
I kept kickin' cause a person only floats when he's dead

If I had one wish, it wouldn't be wealth
It would be that we could just love ourself
Cause everyday is like we kill a million dreams
And it seems everybody on different teams
I don't mean to get deep, I'm just speakin' the truth
We in a two bed trailer with a leak in the roof
I ate potatos every way you could ever make 'em
When your hungry gotta use your imagination
My mom did her best, she would hug and kiss me
Even though we had more fucking mice than Disney
I still had some Polos and plenty of drawers
While she was livin' life with the same two bras
The lightning strikes, like God say thunder rolls
Life is cold like an eskimo in summer clothes
I suffer softly but never let nothin' stop me
And I miss my little girl like somebody shot me

Out in prison make crosses, fuck diamonds and jewels
Still flyer than Jordan when he was runnin' with Bulls
So many shots had missed, so many cops was pissed
So many songs I had written in the past on this
It's a lot of impostors try to tell you the same
But how the fuck could I explain, no one knows my pain
From the cord on my navel, I was a G crom the cradle
I don't snort cause they say that bitch Cain/'caine killed Abel
I'm not sure you understand it but I must express it
Santa Claus is on heroine, there ain't no presents
And mom all this shit makes my eyes so watery
Now I understand why you tried to win the lottery
We gon' make it I promise don't let the memories haunt us
I remember we was at the bus stop in pajamas
Tryin' to run from a home that brought so many tears
Bad luck like we must've broke a thousand mirrors
