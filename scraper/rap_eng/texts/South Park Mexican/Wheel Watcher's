Verse 1:SPM:
Wheel watchers pullin boppers from a mile away
Contemplation, hesitation, baby have a nice day
I been grindin these streets dodgen feds and cops
I roll on choppers on day, but 23's by dark
Bubbles lit, legs split when they see my shit
Screens rain out tha sky all my tags legit
See my flossin and im tossin wide body fa sho
Lane to lane grippin grain AC blowin like snow
Now keep winnin playas spinnin when i chop in the wind
My lil body and big body and my Double O benz
When burn off on (?) represent tha dam hill
Land of tha real pull ya feel pop up bumpa and grilles
I switch to tyte, now im in the bentley
Wood deck with leather seats and some 123
Ain't shit changed in this game hoes still approachin
Steady lookin at our cars cuz the wheels of Fortune

Chorus:
Im, im a wheel watcher
What you say girl?
Im, im a wheel watcher
All the girls holler
Im, im a wheel watcher

Verse 2: SPM
I went from no shows to car shows, from change to dolla's
Put the ruger in the couger and bought the impala
Choppers spinnin girls grinnin at the lights on the benz
Off the lot, on dot, we some million dollar men
Land cruizer, range rovers for special occasions
7 digits just for wigits in every situation
I can go underwater when im in a submarine
But jump back on tha land, 10 door limozine
Fettucine caviar, lamborginis and jaguars
From food to cars whe shine bright like the stars
Im heard in 3 different languages and several voices
Luxury benz with tha screens south leather rolls royce
I can keep it for the winter cuz its time for tha summer
Tire Tracks are yokohama and tailgates say HUMMER
VISUALIZE AND analyze they bops and they watch
To keep this the definition of the wheel watchers

Chorus
Im, im a wheel watcher
What you say girl?
Im, im a wheel watcher
All the girls holler
Im, im a wheel watcher
Tell'em again

Verse 3: Un Known
Wheel Watchers they watchin these wheels
Steady boppin steady lookin wanna know how it feel
Keep it live on glide forieng doors and red wine
All the time calvin kline in the 62 down
Wardrobe is kinda throwed, peice , clothes and Mo MO
Coast to Coast never boast, yeah the spokes on Poke
Lamorginis, swang swing, yeah rich from tha screw
Dope houses Sold out if you know what i knew
Nickles and dimes, quarter ounces, slangin rock
No need to slang dope, cuz i signed with dope house

Hustlas make dollas, ballas make paper
Paper pull hoes dope house is gettin laid
