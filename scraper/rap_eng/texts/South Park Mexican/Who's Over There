[South Park Mexican]
Yeah
I just wanna
Say, "I love all you haters"
It's not your fault
You was raised to like the smell of shit
Us players, we like the smell of roses

Chorus: Marilyn Rylander
Who's over there (there they go, right there)
No one said that life was fair (y'all playin' dirty)
You haters come from everywhere (from all over the place)
Y'all hate us just because you're scared (mark-ass motherfuckers)

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Broken dreams, to be the coke king
Everyone asleep except me and the dope fiends
5 A.M. sittin' on the corner
The day's gettin' warmer, but my heart's gettin' colder
Sold my last boulder, let the storm pass over
Never touch my dope
I'm only the cash holder
Soldier
I sleep with one eye open
In the land where you see men die, smokin'
Let the fry soak in, water, water
Hillwood cowboy, fuckin' down the farmer's daughter
Street saga
Corner store robber
Like Pasell I take your gal a la cama
Baller
My block hotter than lava
The wetback
In love with my mojada
Papa, shit talker, dick dropper
SPM, the rap Skywalker

Chorus
Who's over there (I see y'all mad doggin')
No one said that life was fair (y'all boys playin' dirty)
You haters come from everywhere (there so many of y'all)
Y'all hate us just because you're scared (don't be scared, homey)

[Verse 2: Low G]
Which road will I travel
White sand or hard gravel
Fuck a friend, I don't even trust my own shadow
I'm in a battle with the dirtiest of enemies
Cause I'm chippin' dope, all across the seven seas
Low G and the wheeze of the Vo-C
At the ranch where my weed plants grow free
December 9
A child was born with no heart
Since a kid
They said I wouldn't go far
Ghetto scars, tryin' to keep away from mero bars
The jura's hour
Fuck Escobar
And the Diaz brothers, I roll with top soldiers
If they approach us, I bury those cockroaches

Chorus
Who's over there (I see y'all lookin')
No one said that life was fair (I can feel the jealousy)
You haters come from everywhere (they all around me)
Y'all hate us just because you're scared (don't be scared, join us nigga)

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I ain't start from the bottom
I dug myself out a hole
Grabbed a pen, and taught myself how to flow
Now my snow crystal, my shit primo
Toe taggin' haters with a tiny torpedo
The CEO
Me and my nuts make a good trio
I'm the nigga pissin' in a cup for my P.O
Life hit me like a double shot of whiskey
In every song, I give a piece of my history
This be reality
They wanna battle me
But that'll be the day
Gather up my family
Packin' heat
Pick 'em up, like a sack of meat
Most my niggas dead
Or walkin' round with shackled feet
We had to eat, you can ask these cops
I bought my first hooptie with fifteen rocks
They smoked non-stop
I watched as the crack melted
I comes real cause I really can't help it

Chorus
Who's over there (there they go, right there)
No one said that life was fair (y'all boys playin' dirty)
You haters come from everywhere (from all over the place)
Y'all hate us just because you're scared (don't be scared, homey)

[South Park Mexican]
Yeah, this one goes out to all my players
You know what I'm sayin'
Don't let these haters keep you down, man
Besides
Anybody who lets a hater get 'em down
Ten times out of ten is a hater
I ain't trippin'
We comin' down, baby, 2000
Just like that
