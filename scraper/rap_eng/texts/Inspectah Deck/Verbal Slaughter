"Phantasm, I'm about to flip"
"Every time I speak shit, I freak shit"
"Phantasm, I'm about to flip"
"Every time I speak shit, I freak shit"

[Verse One: Phantasm]
It's funny how we forget ya bastards
Ain't mastered it yet
CD's, we out lasted ya set
Recline my seat
Dwellas, time to shine and eat
In '99 y'all can't compete
Loud Records, yeah we run the streets
With Wu, Big Pun and Infamous
Pete Rock and Dwellas son get into this
Ever since a teen
I've been plotting for cream
Ain't nothing stopping my dream of us locking the scene
But yeah, finally we capitalizing off the rhyming
It's surprising how we rising, reaching new horizons
Analyzing, masterminding, combining
With the best
Enterprising, still shining and climbing, fuck the rest
Trying hard to maintain this
While you get it up the anus like Greg Louganis
Talking 'bout you rich and famous
I keep the stainless steel and one shot, one kill
And don't mistake sales kid for skills for real

[Scratch Hook]
"Rough neck, Inspectah Deck's on the set"
"Yeah"
"Rough neck, Inspectah Deck's on the set"
"The maker, owner, plus soul controller"

[Verse Two: Inspectah Deck]
Yo
I rock for block niggas
Young bucks and brolic bitches
Politicking with the globe in exchange to cop riches
Dynamic vocal
Span global, ran locals off the avenue
You brand new cats can never handle
The one man brigade known to raid the airwaves
Write rhymes with survival knives, bleed in the page
The rap attack is like Mr. Magic
With tragic results
Electrifying, imagine the volts
Burn tracks like Pirellis
This unchained melody trapped inside your memory
May cause a felony
The antidote for the wack quotes you blow
Rap pro holding too much weight to overthrow

[Scratch Hook]
"I freak the ill shit"
"U.G."
"Scientist pack appliances"
"I freak the ill shit"
"U.G."
"Hit, smash, by the half"

[Verse Three: U.G.]
Yo, yo
Verbal slaughter
Rap skills kill like Orca
Quick to off ya then float off like flying saucers
My rhyme torches, leaving cats begging for life
Third legging your wife
Sharp like the nails that punctured the palms of Christ
When I write rhymes
I slice lines that leave your dome froze like white lines
Shorten your life sign
Son I strikes spines, crack your vertebrae
I'll murder you then run around showing the tape
Like O Dog did in Menace
Rap chemist
Smacking this
Never slacking this
Slap the shit out of rap niggas
For playing a role
Don't give a fuck if you platinum or gold

"Word up man, y'all motherfuckers really don't know what this hip hop's all about" - DJ Premier

[Verse Three: Inspectah Deck]
Yes yes y'all
I hit ya like a wrecking ball
Stepping tall, weapon all hood
Supplying the goods like cartels in Spain
While the autopsy shows hemorrhage to your brain
Stand in close range I leave ya ear drums in flame
Thoughts lightening up the charts with sharp shooter aim
This Uncontrolled Substance can't be contained
With the blood of battle, I remain stained

[Phantasm]
Diabiase
Skate for eight more lines to kill
Shines the thrill
Drop rhymes at will
Collect hella respect, it's Dwellas and Deck
Keep ya fellas in check
Cause they don't pose a threat
You best control your set
Told you ya whole crew will get ran through
When we stamp through like the Manchu
Stay strapped like bamboo
For those who oppose, .38 snub nose tucked in 40 below

[U.G]
Yeah, fuck what Willies wear
Rap's wild like hands in Billy Bear
In 48 Hours, verbal showers, get your rain gear
I reign here
You niggas be soft like rein deer
Ain't nothing but pain here
Fucking with me, you sucker MC
Like Run and them
Put a gun to them
Punish men, stumbling off gin
Often get lost in my own zone
Split ya chromosomes, bones hard like stone from ancient Rome
