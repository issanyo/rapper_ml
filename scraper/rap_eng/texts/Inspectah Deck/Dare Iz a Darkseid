[Verse 1: Esoteric]

This is my dick tone
Your flows so dated that it has friends with flip phones
Now my shits grown
I’m at a clam bake with Man-Ape
You’re eating Alpo with Edie Falco on the Jersey landscape
What type of a stunt is that?
What type of a G.I. Joe Grunt is that?
Part Mark Hamill, part camel, part Lexus door panel, part vandal
You have the self-esteem of 17 teen net queens
That are less lean, yet who’s breasts seem
Flatter than boards used by a chess team
They chicken heads like robots from Seth green and their breath’s obscene
I’m an ex-marine death machine
You’re a nectarine that’s never mean and never seen
With their [?] clean
You’re dope, like the NFL refs are clean
I get it popping while the rest snooze, cuddle up and dream
You’re the original to Ignition
I’m the remix, the fix to what was missing
Listen, you don’t want to stand up for Sea
On the mic I’m wise like Gandalf the Grey

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck}

Your new bars lukewarm this is pizza oven
I lean a fiend eyes bulged cheeks sucked in
Crazy like the second Jesus coming
To me it’s nothing
You hear the music gets scary when the beats is coming
Imma bring it to your face no 3D glasses
Airing out bombs like TD passes
Splash in a mint green Aston
GT mashing
Czarface CD blasting
Verbal Intercourse colder than the Winter Warz
Hard bars lock you in like a prison door
Haters they jell, oh well I don’t care about ‘em
Hated since 12, yeah I take the air out ‘em
That mean the oxygen
Arsonist they charging them
The Czarface dodging the case with Ray Donovan
Full time mind blower eyes on the soldier
Get the money, get the girls, strike a pose on a poster
And I’m ghost son
