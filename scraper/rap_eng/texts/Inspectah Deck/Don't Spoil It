[Intro: MF DOOM]
Keep it movin'

[Verse: Inspectah Deck]
I'm from the era that started the park wars
I beat box, pop-and-lock, B-boys spinnin' on cardboard
Graffiti Rock, Beat Street, Breakin', and Style Wars
Above the Rim, Brown Sugar, Belly, and CB4
Watch me drop a Wild Style on a Krush Groove
My Hustle & Flow, I'm sure to get Paid in Full
That's the Rhyme & Reason, so pardon me
Who's the Man with the Juice that crashed the House Party?
They just Baller Blockin', 'cause I'm Notorious
No stoppin' me 'til I'm dead or State Property
How High can you fly over New Jack City?
Look up, Friday, I Got the Hook Up
I'm hip-hop's Most Wanted, comin' Straight Outta Park Hill
Call 'em Idlewild, my bars ill
Get Rich or Die Tryin', but Never Die Alone
Love to my Boyz n the Hood, I'm Ghost, Dog

[Outro: Esoteric & MF DOOM]
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha) Shhh, don't spoil it
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Shhh, don't spoil it
(Keep it movin') Shhh, don't spoil it
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Don't spoil it
Don't spoil it
Shhh (ha ha ha ha ha)
