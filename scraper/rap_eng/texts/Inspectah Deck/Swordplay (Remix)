Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rebel I.N.S., your highness
AKA Ayatollah, the high roller, title holder
For my nigga J-Love, Brace yourself..

[Verse 1]
1, 2, yo, yo, I swing swords, one into four like Charlie Ward
Clep shooter, crash the SSL Boards
Should of scored when it come crunch time
One time tryin' to steal my sunshine
No time to unwind
I put my hand on my hip, don't let the black chrome slip
Loose lips cause full clips to fly on the strip
So I walk swift, toatin' a Johnny Walker fifth
Niggas talk shit, real heads be spazzin' often
From the Shao borough, that be the sec I claim
Test my grain, find the cause of death hard to explain
With the pen still smokin, I drop the next lame
He got the same hot flame before the cops came
I be makin' heads spin, like Dayton
While takin you back to phat tags and breakin'
This is Menage-a-trois for your mental, diggin' out the instrumental
I drive you wild like a rental

[Kung-fu movie dialogue] (x2)
The Tiger and Crane techniques. The tigerâ€™s fast, tough, fierce, hard
A sick one - your swordplay, inspector, has much improved

[Verse 2]
Yo, hittin' there like Thomas Hearns
Bustin' wild, the weed burn
Shorty sixteen, yearns for my whole crew to take turns
I'm a loose cannon, medically examine
Found deadly as a plague, so it spread like famine
Splurgin', whippin' out the dirty version
Throwin' rocks at the ghetto birds circlin' the urban
Workin' overtime, you know it's just shine
Niggas scope mine, might as well work for for po-nine
But who's sign, light up the city like it's Gotham?
Startin' from the bottom, then work with stardom
Hit 'em with the anthem, words never forgotten
Modern-day marksman, Killa Bee squadron
Armed and dangerously crash the party
While he be toxi on dark Bakardi
Next thing you know, lights on time to go
Bitches cursin' niggas out, like they ain't got dough

[Kung-fu movie dialogue] (x4)

Shoalin, Killa Hills, 1-0-3-0-4
Rebel I, terrify, S.I.N.Y
And what, tear the gut...
