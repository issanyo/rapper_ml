I'mma push it to the limit like Manny and Tone
Like, somebody carry him home, deeper than Barry's tone
My young one, heir to the throne
I fuck it up, you be hearing the moans
Feeling the jones, dude do it smooth as kaluha
And you thought you was the future, you was the loser
Me, I'mma doolah schooler
This just use your manuever
I'm cool as the cooler, with the heart of a champ
So to fail's not part of the plan, I just started to dance
King of pop, moonwalking they ass
Getting dirty like water to sand, man, pump up the jam
Cuz the track's Godzilla
Way beyond monster, half bar killer
Charged with crash bar, smash ya'll iller
Camouflage large, hard head, Park Hilla, ahh

Yeah, I'm wild like Clifton Powell, grammar tight
Like Vanna White hands, how I flip the vowel
Give it up, son, lift your towel, you're like a pitch
Just missed off the bat, I'mma hit you foul
Just bow when you face the great, ya'll skating on
Thin ice, or INS raise the stakes
Fuck around I'mma name your stage, Undadogz run the yard
AKA Doomsday Brigade
I say, I am not a gangsta, I am not a rapper
But nigga my response, shots flying at your Jaguar
Snitching in your song, stop lying bout your swagger
Popping shit now, hear him crying bout it after
I'm a different cloth from them, when I toss the blend
Heads spin like Porshe rims
What I talk, should of caused a trend, when I scope the lens
I got the whole world wanting in
