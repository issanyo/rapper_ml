(Leaf Dog)
We attack like a ravenous pack
Crippling tracks like Christopher Reeves running the lap
Take you back
Bringing something that this new shit lacks
They just focus on the birds like a modern aircraft
Waiting on the hourglass
How longs it lasting
I'm like a teacher walking by the way you see the surpassing
Fuck fashion
Leave em twitching with their nerves scrambling
Missing dope bars like getting pulled drug trafficking
Learn to speak less watch them show their own demons
The inspectors on the decks like ships before they're leaving
Where's all the meaning
Someone we can believe in
All they're giving us is words like a subtitle screening
It's open hunting season
Word flew in from the other region
Coming for your head bound to get even
Raw shit I deliver whilst the rest try gleaming
Play this like Bobby Fischer when I lay my chess piece in

We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
Brothers of the stone and the Rebel INS
Food for thought so raw its hard to digest yo
We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
For those who really need this
For those who really need this

(Inspectah Deck)
Your highness
Speak the deep shit
The unique gift that I spit
Continuous kick never releasing
Your brains in the cobra clutch
I'm ice cold to the touch
I choke em up like exposure to dust
Yeah you know it's us
We the last mohicans
We speaking the truth
The whole time teaching the youth
Passing the torch
I still clap back for the sport
Back to the wall
Strapped for the brawl
What's happening with yall
Rappers wearing clothes tighter than hoe's
Time to expose we post it up out side of your shows
Yeah get it clear
Respect don't get checked like that questionnaire
Until the death I'm a let it air
And I ain't never scared to represent what I stand for
Rebel I soldier metal gear
Game new like a PS4
We gets raw show em what they need us for

We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
Brothers of the stone and the Rebel INS
Food for thought so raw its hard to digest yo
We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
For those who really need this
For those who really need this

Speak with a purpose
Only get dissed if you deserve it
Words that lift your lid when you heard it
Too much fake idol worship
Won't find me where the herd is
Just drop this on their head like some bird shit
Chuck the baton to some younger cats that's rapping
But don't disappear
Keep the mission clear make it happen
Still sat in rooms with the fumes
Bang tunes like forever still a fan
Like to see some other people getting better
Fuck been a hater
So do your thing I'm a see you later
The test of time is weeding out the fakers
The realness tear off faces you see what your faced with
They never said I flip a flow that's basic I stay creative
Couple hoping that I might have stopped
I'm sorry to dissapoint
I only chop off heads on my writers block
Don't weigh enough on the scale they say the fight is off
And fuck a pen I spit freestyles to write them off

We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
Brothers of the stone and the Rebel INS
Food for thought so raw its hard to digest yo
We oversee this
Hold the art form like museum pieces
For those who really need this
For those who really need this
For those who really need this
