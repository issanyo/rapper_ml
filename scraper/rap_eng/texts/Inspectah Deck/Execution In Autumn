[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train

[Raekwon]
Banana clip Mac-aholic, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping

[Verse 2: RZA]
Miramax movie magic, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap, dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music

[U-God]
My ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age
