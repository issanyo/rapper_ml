[Verse 1: RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!

[Chorus: U-God]
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James

[Chorus: Cappadonna & Ghostface Killah]
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang
Something in the hall went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}
Something in the hole went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copped for 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers

[Verse 5: U-God]
These ain't the camera guys, cause terror in your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or is it Dole, front row of the Super Bowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLAP CLAP
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLAP CLAP

[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck, Cappadonna, Ghostface Killah & U-God]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLAP CLAP
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLAP CLAP
Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG..
Something in the hole went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}
Something in the hall went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
