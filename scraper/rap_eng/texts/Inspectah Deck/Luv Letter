[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ay, what's up baby?
I need you to sit down for a minute, relax your feet
I'll keep an eye on the dinner
Something I've been wanting to say for a minute
So just listen

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I'm just sitting here, pouring my heart, even though
Usually, about now, I be touring with the Gods
Play your status like I'm MJ, scoring with the broads
My love for you is deep, a little more than what's it's called
So how am I at fault, we both got issues
I miss you on the road, but at home I fight with you
At times I might be tight with you, take my life before I hit you
Situation difficult to get through
You was just concerned with all the bitches in my face
I was just concerned with all the riches in my face
Grown man, so these bitches know they place
I know it's no love 'cause yo they fucking different niggas every day
Couldn't wait to hit the crib and see your face
If only for one night, the sunlight's gleamin' in our face
No love without pain, I still love you the same
But still share the same love for the game, and so

[Hook x2: Ms. Whitney]
Baby, I just got your love letter
I'm trying to do better, 'cause now I know better
I'm gonna hold you down, I'm gon' stay strong
You gave me your word, so I ain't gonna do you wrong

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
There be days when you call him on stage, text messaging
All in a rage, you think I'm fooling around
But the truth is, I'm moving around, L.A
Yesterday to the Bay, next stop Chi-Town
Rarely get a chance to lie down, snatching paper with the fly sound
All the hoes, you are not down
When the going got rough, you ain't jump up and leave
But if you did, wouldn't be so tough to believe
'Cause I know I put you through it, woman like you
You just trooped it, girlfriends calling you foolish
Hang on in there girl, 'cause when I"m finished
We gonna live it to the limit, I'ma give you the world
Just saying that it's you on my mind, I wish I was there
But I gotta stay true to my grind
Coast to coast line, strolling the curve
Kiss the kids for me, baby, I be home on the third

[Hook x2: Ms. Whitney]
Baby, I just got your love letter
I'm trying to do better, 'cause now I know better
I'm gonna hold you down, I'm gon' stay strong
You gave me your word, so I ain't gonna do you wrong

[Verse 3: Fes Taylor]
You told me stay off the block
But still held me down when a nigga got locked, yeah
You brought me clean drawers and socks
On the dance floor tried to sneak in some top
It's like my pen be the heart, ink be the blood
I know your mama pissed that you fell for a thug
I can't wait to give you kisses and hugs just to be right near you
Wishing I was, missing your love
So close, but it's so much distance between us
So I call collect, long distance, hoping you pick up
Yeah, I know the Gods try to holla
But I'm that nigga, still touch the world getting dollars
Just ride with me, mama, release date soon
Said I'd probably touch the streets around the middle of June
Can't wait to get you undressed, P.S. sincerely yours
Always, mama, love, Fes, yeah

[Outro: Ms. Whitney]
