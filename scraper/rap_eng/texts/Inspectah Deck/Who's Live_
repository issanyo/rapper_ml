[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
You rapper... you big, buyin' the chain out the back of The Source
Your whole style is cubic, dun, aiyo, aiyo
Yo, yo, aiyo, yo, yo, aiyo

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Who live as us, streets vibin'
Freaks linin' up, cuz we shinin'
Pretty mama go on, do that dance
Cuz after the jam, we slidin' into two black vans

[Inspectah Deck]
And we out to the double tree, shorty she lovin' me or
She love the fact, we got weed and bubbly
Lovely, sounds bang out the Benz buggy
Mami got a fat ass, plus her friend for me
Ya'll keep try'nna front, meet I.N
Keep ridin' us, cuz we grindin'
From the front to the back of the club
We them knuckleheadz actin' up, and that's what's up
Crack that cognac and pass the cup
Had me, come out the throwback and match ya tough
I'm comin' with the mask and gloves, to stack the doves
And everything after that is love
Who's that? That's your cuz, back with us
Throw your hands up, and catch the buzz
But yo, Baby Boy, though I'm not Tyrese
My initials, Deck, but two, I.D., and where you find me
Slowly floatin' in a new fly V
Cruisin' down the side streets with a true dime piece
And I spit nothing less then exclusive
Dressed in the newest, 'Festo, ride with The Movement

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Who live as us, streets vibin'
Freaks linin' up, cuz we shinin'
Smokin' tri-colored weed in a bong
Greasin' this song, for g's, got freaks in they thong

[Inspectah Deck]
Ya'll keep try'nna front, meet I.N
Keep ridin' us, cuz we grindin'
Got a jones for those big faced bills
Chicks, they grill, see me when I hit 8 mil, bitch...
