[Verse 1: Large Professor]
Mr. Magic, retractable mic cord, I'm latching
Action, no hashtag or caption
Suits me, rise up above all scrutiny
Bruce Lee kicks to the page on loose leaf
Tablets, I write precise more fabulous
Lyrics, hardcore sound that cure earaches
Battering the gathering then lift y'all spirits
Remotely moving in the cut low-key
Like a lion just walked into the circus
Now they crying for more
From the king and for law
My valor comes from the will of God's power
Eat, drink, party and build the watchtowers
Looking over declarations, audacious
On night shifts when the pen's more righteous
I can rule the world in just jeans and Niké kicks
And every single thing I write hits

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I’m the MC Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic)
Most are pathetic
I fill the sky with smoke from the wreckage
Rebel I cut throats for breakfast
Slippers and robe on, I'm saying it's little to no effort
Been in the trenches, jarhead to the bar heads
But where they still jumpin' niggas like their car dead
Marginal spread between me and y'all heads
I wouldn't last this long, that's what y'all said
Surprise motherfucker, Sam Jackson voice
Czardi Gras, live action boy
Watch your mouth when you talkin' and address me your highness
I'm seen with the flyest of queens dressed in the finest
The clever minded yet cold blooded assassins
Never personal this ain't no love in this rapping
Murderous slang, my bars start rebellions
They birds in the game, New Orleans Pelicans

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Yeah, INS what up, Large Pro what up, ayo, yo
Indigenous, yeah I spit it with the native tongue
Paint the town MLZ surf to 81
Plastic guns on the face
I ain't part of this race I was made in space
Fuck you salutation
I’m a mathematical equation
I don't need a human opinion for affirmation
I'm a doctor that'll crack the Hippocratic Oath
Spit a savage dose, leave a rapper comatose
Shatter foes with my weapons
It's medicine from the heaven
I'm menacing with my presence
The nerve of these fucking peasants
I murder them with the sentence, I'm merciless with a pen
My words are Ric Flair that disperse with MC Ren
They the men so I should be reimbursing all of them
Everything coming out of me's poisonous wrath
Even my piss stream cuts toilet in half
In the speed that it takes an android to do math
Avoid my path
