[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the lyrical grand prix
We have our drivers racin for a $3,000,000 purse
Winner takes all, gentlemen start your engines...

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Give me room, hit the tune
Feature presentation coming soon, early June
Killa Bee platoon, well groomed
Spells doom, raise the volume
You react like a werewolf in a full moon
With the force of a Trojan horse
Pushing forward, have your seat belt fastened
We blasting into orbit, Wu restore the new chamber
Wu-Banga number 9, expert precision and design
Mastermind the plan took a matter of time
From the confines of the cold world I shine
It's amazin, the grace, changin in the place
Blazin the brakes, invadin your space
Which remains in the race, claimin first place
Raisin the stakes, it's a game to disgrace
I hold many jewels, drop more than I wear
I come in peace, prepare for the warfare
The invincible fold, when they're caught in the square
And the talk mad shit when the coast is clear

[Break: Inspectah Deck]
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
We've just completed the first lap

[Verse 2: Streetlife]
Blood kin, knowledge, knowledge, I build with rap scholars
Guns and wallets, prowess, Staten Island stylist
12 men roster, live long, prosper
Street philosopher, you end up like Jimmy Hoffa
Ain't a damn thing changed but the aim, bullet range
Strange universe, I was nursed to blow your mainframe
Think first, convert, all verse live in concert
Pull a skirt, burst, while y'all niggas star search
Mind yours, why you eyeing mines for
Posing like a matador, I must got something you wanna die for
Touch mine, reach him up, his headline, both grant
9 inch rusty splint push through your nose is vent
Got my eyes on the grand prize, place your bet
Watch me win it by a landslide, pull off an upset
Hold the burner close by my hands and my pocket
Hold the trophy high and keep my eyes on the prophet

[Break: Inspectah Deck]
And a new driver has entered the contest
Ladies and gentlemen, driver number 99
In the red car...

[Verse 3: U-God]
Fog lights beam, car 99 supreme
A high-powered machine spits sparks of baroline
The smell of gasoline, motor roar, the crowd roars
The rag tuck rip, box cut caught in my jaws
Enforcing my laws, ramrod in my garage
The grease lightning, dusty rose, shake him, bon voyage
Now duel of the iron, flying feud for you writers
The speed demon, rebel talk, triggers, freedom fighters
Was tracked in the cock pit, I'm writing exact
I'm crushing corners, who that kid riding the track
With the Wu helmet, 6th nigga, 5 cars track
The last but not least, I bliss through the scrimmage
No brakes, I dart, I'm racing for the finish
Understand my hunger for my land down under
It's the thunderous rush, after the sounds get crush
The purse snatching pound, by all means snatch cream
Tear your ass out of town

[Break: Inspectah Deck]
As we near the final lap
Team Wu-Tang seems to be buildin
A sizeable lead on the competition

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I know how to fold 'em like Kenny Rogers
Popular demand, overstand these piranhas
Moving on the track like a Monaco GT
I stand out similar to 3D on your TV
Easily breezing watching the speed dial climb
Style of rhyme, left the foes miles behind
Leaving skid marks on the charts
Aimed at the hearts of the fake, sparked on the tapes
It's starts from the gate, darts penetrate
Freestyle as the decoy to sharpen the bait
Holding major weight, my Supreme Team dominates
Circulating, taking all bets you place
In and out of state, twirling L's on the freeway
NY to SC, NC to VA, GA to MD, CA to KY
FL to IL, TX to MI

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
As we near the checkered flake, ladies and gentlemen
Team Wu-Tang's holding down the 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions
And it looks like it's goin to be another sure win for Team Wu-Tang
As they take home another pot of gold with this $3,000,000 purse
Rebel INS, U-God, Street Life

Get the loot, get the loot
Cash money y'all, cash money y'all, cash money y'all
