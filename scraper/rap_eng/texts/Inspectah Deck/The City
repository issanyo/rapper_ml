[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
You gotta get up, you gotta get out
Get from under, it's time to get over
Get right, or get left, get even with the odds
Get yours, Solomon...

[Inspectah Deck]
Eight million stories in the naked city, New York City
You make it, they'll take it quickly
Ask Po & Richie, coke sold blow you over fifty
I know who with me, I know you won't trick me
I'm O.G., stuck to the code G
You can never break him or take him alive
You can never face him or trace the design
Believe me breathing, guaranteed I'll make the way to survive
And built with such grace and strive
That from all those who sore mention him with the greats of his time
Before I sign off, salute
To every soldier, major player or crime boss
We not taking time off
It's harder to hustle, I must get mine off
Mandatory, the story concludes
And according to Wu, you know Cash Rules Everything

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
I want it now, and ain't got time to waste
And even though they say crime don't pay
It's got to be a better way, they thinking more like 10 years
I'm thinking more like 10 days

[Solomon Childs]
Yeah, I shook up the city, trap star of the city
Had the best work in the city, had the flyest broad in the city
Ran with some of the flyest niggas in the city
Til they left me for dead in the city, with no water
Left me to dehydrate in the city
Money supply, went short in the city
The wise tell me, money can't buy love
But what's funny is love can't survive without money
Nowadays in my poverty city, but I love my city
And I'll be damned if I lay down and die in the city
Never, cuz in order to rise, you gotta fall in the city
But the mission is you get up when you fall in the city

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, Ayatollah, Heroin
K.M.G., Young Wu-Tang
Hustle hard, nigga
