[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Leave my spinach in here, man, yo
I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
And damage your mind like bad cocaine
The flamethrower started the game, it's game over
I Holly Holm's rappers while signing your bae's poster
I'm way colder, you need gloves tryna touch the kid
The Terminator with the flow, let nothing live
Voice shining, you could hardly steer
Like a judge, been handing out bars for years
Yeah, the team make cream while you daydream
Futuristic, our names up in laser beams
I make a scene on Broadway in broad day
24/7 365, man, I'm all day
Get it right, sir, I global mogul
Flex superpower like I changed in a phone booth

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Yo money grip money grip, yo, this ain't no ego trip
This be a slaughter, I raise it up on the ego tip
Report to the battle booth
CZARFACE goes for more than blue Snaggletooth
A living weapon, I stay and step with the people
They accept me as regal, so may I sketch on the easel
And paint a picture of evil
I'm going through a splatter phase
I'm watching Peter Jackson Dead Alive Saturday
I got the drive of Allen I. with the mind of Albert Ein
Wildest rhymes, treat you like Hammer Greg Valentine
Rappers said they want beef, yelling from the side of lines
You don't really want shit, son, you a child of mine
No GNR, but I slash you like the lead guitar
He is odd, leaving people scarred like keying cars
Stop your motion like Jason and the Argonauts
Ray Harry how I'm housing in the parking lot
Rap whiter, track writer, rap writer around your neck
I fuck up Superman like Zack Snyder on the set
(Don't you ever forget)
Save the drama for your mama
'Cause your favorite rapper's rocking CZARFACE pajamas
