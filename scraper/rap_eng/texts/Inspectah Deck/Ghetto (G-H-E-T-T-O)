[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
These mean streets of N.Y.C
Got a hold of me, just when I thought I was out
They pull me back in... Aiyo..

[Inspectah Deck]
I've been, thrown in the bullpens over again
And I've been, sent up a river not built to swim
I had, diamonds and furs all at a young age
And I had, fame and fortune, name on the front page
I got, shot at and sliced twice over some dice
And I got, set up by broads one night while gettin' nice
I've seen, the livest thug cat die over drugs
And I've seen, the little nigga that fire the slugs
The hood, gave me free lunch, dumps and Johnny pumps
The hood, gave me free base, gates and shotty pumps
They found, Sonya son, face down in the trash
And they found, the loaded gun and eight rounds in the grass
It's real, some images'll make your wide eyes closed
It's real, I don't regret it, it's the life I chose
I made, money and love, move bundles in loads
And I made, plenty of foes, that's the way it goes

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
When you livin' in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That's just the way it goes
Livin' in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That's just the way it goes

[Inspectah Deck]
I feel, that it's a set back, death in a trap
And I feel, the foul presence, so a weapon is strapped
You live? You be talking the town for short time
You live? They be hawkin' you down with long knives
And still, these are the good times, I wouldn't contest
But still, I don't believe this is good as it gets
We tried, to beat the game, playin' possum, we die
And we tried, to ease the pain, stayin' constantly high
It's like, you gotta fight for your life to break bread
It's like, there's more cops on the block then baseheads
That's why, I drop a jewel, spit rude on tape
And that's why, it's possible to keep food on the plate
I strive, to persevere, though my dunns ain't here
And I strive, surprised I made it thirty somewhat years
For now, I get the Presidents, ya hustle low-key
For life, I represent the H-Double O-D

[Chorus]
