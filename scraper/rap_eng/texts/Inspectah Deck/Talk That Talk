[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I’m cold like Leonard Snart
Spark where predators mark
Any record that can shred it apart
Check the live talk, sidewalk slang, make your mind walk
Fire off my lines, pop off like ninety winecoff
Serve up rappers a side of fries with cole slaw
My crew hold it down like Hodor! Hodor!
Ultra magnetic, track record
Read it on Reddit, the heat is on, the beat is on set it
Deeper than Prince Namor
Chainsaw massacre half of the rappers who’s claiming that they were
Hashtag cash bag, puff pass watch me spaz that
Hazmat rap, smash your man’s swag
Czarface darts sharper than benz brakes
The template for new emcees to emulate
The bad man mad like marching the Pac 10
Catch me slow dancing with Scarlett Johansson

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Kamikaze quotes I write like Ta-Nehisi Coates
Smooth like Muhammad Ali floats, get you on the ropes
This is jungle action, T’Challa on you folks
Salvador Dali in the zone with the smokes
My cranium, negative vibes of vibranium aplenty
What kind of Wakanda are you staying in or living in
I keep it low key like Tom Hiddleston
My words carry weight like a triple chin
Feeling so focused now that you can say I’m a synonym for Ritalin
Well you’re a synonym for simpleton
The only time you on stage when we waiting for the fans to trickle in
You ain’t fooling nobody man you got us giggling
Listen, I caught a body rap and no life bid
Because real killers move in silence like hybrids
We the fly kids, make your mind darker
Two Lukes on the mic, Cage and Skywalker

(S is for Skywalker)
(I love it, heh heh heh)
(Talk that talk)

Now the formula is this
Me, George, and INS
For those that can’t count it goes, you know the rest
The emcee [?] big up is who we be
(Czarface) baby in the place to be
