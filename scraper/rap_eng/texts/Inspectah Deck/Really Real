[Intro: Carlton Fisk]
Aiyo, INS, yo, these niggas talking real stupid, again
Nigga, you know what it is, nigga
How you gonna stop the real, nigga? It's impossible
Nigga, fuck is wrong with you niggas, is you stupid or something, let's go

[Carlton Fisk]
Aiyo, go against House Gang and handle the war
In the streets we ain't asking who you handling for
Wave my hand have you faggot niggas hugging the floor
Scarface, shower scene, Angel blood and the chainsaw
Shells hit your car, tear your frame off
Beef got you covered like the faggot niggas, bodies in steak sauce
What you think I brough all these lions and apes for
Shotgun pele timey, dumping your face boy
Baby, it's a jungle, I got animal taste for
Real estate cards, plus keeping my safe full
La Banga, Donnie Cash, I'm catching a case for
Duct tape your face, then, empty your safe off
Soldiers got more than 8 balls, you just a running back
Play the front line with handoffs
Carlton Fisk, ready for the stand off
Five hundred grams, half a man, watch me get that man off

[Fes Taylor]
Real shit, we tryiing to get a mil quick
Son try and block the shots, right after the steel clip
Click, go and get your clique, crews, squads, bring 'em through
I'm so soulful, flow like a singer do
So bitches love me, I live like a swinger too
Niggas scared to play in the game, I brought some ringers through
Go ahead, say my name, the type to look for drama
I snatch your chain, test out your body armor
My reputation like Jeffrey Dahmer, I eat niggas
You running with rappers, I get money with street niggas
I put fire to leech niggas, gasoline homey with cheap liquor
Burn unit see the picture
C.S.I., S.I., chief retire
Rest in peace La, cut 'em like a pizza pie
I need paper, cop cars I don't even drive
I am not a rapper, nah, I don't even rhyme
Just speak true life stories, that's on format
So I use these fake ass rappers like they was doormats
Taylor put in work, no W-2's
So I don't file taxes, I just hustle my way through

[Hook 2X: sample]
I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...

[Inspectah Deck]
Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crums
Filling blunts in the building front, thugging for ones
Full clips fly, nicks, dimes, something to pump
Whole clips fly, whips, dimes, nothing to son
City boy on the corner, I was so involved
So the drama, I embraced it with open arms
I'm trying to shake the fame, hoping I can break the change
Everyday the same, who am I to make a chance
When my niggas risk it all just to play the game
And the youngings going through it, trying to play the same
Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
Cynthia son, forgive me for the sins that I've done

[Hook]

[Inspectah Deck]
Stop the real, really? You only feel me if you walk the same road
Talk the same code
Still dwelling in the hell, and find a time to make a home
The few who escaped with trying to find a safer zone
I ain't waiting for Obama, never doubted him, I"m proud of him
He real, he'll spend a couple mil in the housing then
Seeing is believing, my vision is blurred
Cuz I ain't seen nothing I heard, really nothing but words
The bottom line, I'm still stuck to the curb
Sky high, but it wasn't the sherm, really nothing but herbs
I risk it all for the cause
Even if it's war, with the law, I won't pause
I can't, won't, don't stop, I ain't got an off switch
Dying trying to live it, just to get a small part of it
My squad is sick type, that you don't want problems with
Rolling like seventy mack trucks, what's stopping it?

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
You gots to be kidding my niggas, I worked too hard
Fought too long, I'm standing on my own two
