[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, You could be here one day, Gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as I'm in it
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light
And I will never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light

[Trife Diesel]
Ayo I'm living at the speed of light, Gaining momentum
A hundred thou on my next, Fifty grand in my denims
Exotic women all around me
These fake ballers throwing dubs up in the club
Making it rain, Couldn't drown me
I got mint money, Two years from 50 Cent money
First degree murder, Yall niggas just out of tip money
I been hungry, I been starve'n, I had ninety-nine problems
Solved eighty-nine, Now I got ten problems
So I'ma leave it up to yall, I resolved half of the ten
The other five I'ma leave up to God
Cause I read all the comments that you leave on the blogs
You critics can eat a dick cause I'm constantly on my job

[Chorus]

[Trife Diesel]
Now everybody's thinking something's wrong with Diesel
Since my Pop's passed I don't get along with people
I speak to God in a cathedral, Praying for forgiveness
Cause I'm living at the speed of light, Breaking every limit
Big business, Whip tinted, I'm blowing on piff spinach
I'm all like Doug E. Fresh so just give me my six minutes
And wit it, I'ma take it to the maximum
Show'n love to all of my fans cause I will never turn my back on them
Haters I laugh at em, Throw'n my cash at em
Fuck a middle finger I'm show'n my ass at em
And they can stick it where the Sun don't shine
So God forbid if I don't make it then my son gone shine

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo-Yo, Ayo, The world is mine I saw the writing on the blimps
Since life's a bitch I just gotta treat her like a pimp
I ain't never been a dreamer, Never been asleep
Momma pray'n that her boy ain't deep up in these streets
See no one gave him nothing, What's mine I had to take it
Me against the World, Close friends showing hatred
Jealousy is juvenile, It's gonna take more
Die for what I live and I ain't scared to face war
I'm a winner, Working like Noah on his ark
Throw the fire, I gotta little colder in the heart
Man I told you from the start, This is my World
Paint my life story on a fly mural through the five Burroughs

[Chorus]
