[Intro]
Yo, peace
Yo, one

[Verse]
As I breeze through the isolated fog, on foot
The mind playing weary thoughts to the dog on [wood ?]
Gone off shook
Falling off crooks, not enough books
Calm looks, watch your Mom cook, start to farm grew[?]
The home that protect the rhythm march on his hooves
River turn red, dead carcass for the wolves
Gimme a tangible reason to rap with a thesis
You don't belong, like a man in the animal kingdom
Misleaded sheep in the era of fawns
The mind reach deep, see the beat baritone
Pharaoh notes, go cherish your folks
Embarrass your foes
The mind climb up Everest in treacherous snow
Day 2 sever the globe
Paid Dues, peddlin' coke
Hate to envy the known
Without grasp, the outcast, [the nouns ?] splash
Denounce bad
Try to pick up every lyric
On sonar to see how long your mouth last
Loud days, pace the mountain fast
Inmates in Alcatraz out for snatch
Found the path out the cell
Alarm sound, flash
Now to bail, jump the water
Guns harbour
Blunt starver
The town attacks
Lock the door to the office ward
Officers swore to watch the law, but got deformed
By the men with government numbers
Terrible wonders
Unbearable nothings
Herald they bludgeon
Be careful to trust 'em
Fear stares in the cornea
Kidnap the baby, but forgot the formula
Cut the lawn, mom's gone
Showed up, killed the whole family, left the guard dog
Intelligent interface made to rule the world
Similar to girls, they love jewels and pearls
