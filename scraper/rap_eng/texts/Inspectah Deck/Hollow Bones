[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered Tosh and Benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching

[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source

[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing â€“ Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up bigger, me and the boys
I thought for a second, then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum

[Sample: 3 Evil Masters]
The sword it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it
