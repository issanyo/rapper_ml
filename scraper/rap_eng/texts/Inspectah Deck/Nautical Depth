[Intro: Inspectah Deck + voice]
Yo, yo, what's good?
Esoteric
INS, your Highness
DOOM
7L
CZARFACE at it againâ€”y'all ready?
Yo

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I'm fire in the summertime, cookin' with more heat
Flow like DiCaprio, wolf of all beats
The speak's deep like Leviathan
Boss with the cross-fader, Lord Vader to a Kylo Ren
Search for the plug, I hurt you with love
Man, they pop holograms; call em' virtual thugs
I'm sinister, hear the strings on the Czar guitar
Sick with it, Doc' Strange in the Arkham yard
We go dumber than Trump
More money on the mind, got numbers to crunch
Y'all just waking up for the day, I'm on lunch
I portray my own self, perform my own stunts
Like CZARFACE bustin' in through the window
Bones broke, no hope for your kinfolks
Yeah, as long as CZARFACE wins
We'll be more talked about than Beyonce's twins
Dig it?

[Interlude: voice]

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
No friendly warfare, this ain't wrestlin'
There's nothing staged over here, you're trippin' Mescaline
Drinkin', could've got smacked for what he thinkin'
Would've said the word, whack! Abe Lincoln
Vil still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin'
This game's filthy, get got while blinkin'
Rappers do big-up jail like a recruiter
Game lieutenant hit a boy, said he wasn't shooter
Told him, "Man-up or keep it pushing like a scooter"
Then said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha
What do you know, Bodine shows up
Spit his shitty sixteen and get hisself locked up, up
His story had a moral, he's buried in the soil
Vil put it in her back like a epidural
Kids, eat, sleep, stay away from creeps
Spit it from the heart, this game's for keeps

[Interlude: voice]

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Put you in the dirt like a garden gnome, hard as stone
Lies synchronized like the steps of a marchin' clone
Legion, ruthless, my troops is from parts unknown
Like a minor human torch, arson prone
My field is a minefield, bombs left and right, knobs
It's stormin', kite, sign sealed with divine shield
Even Nick Fury keeps his eye peeled
Wolverine's mutant gene, hopin' time heals
Fightin' Irish girls off me like Notre Dame
While you're ripped and you're a sucker 'cause you can't say no to dames
And you're like novacane 'cause I can't feel you now
Come on, give me some credit
I never say some bullshit everyone else think I'm apathetic
Beat the rhyme sharp and tight
Lethal mind archetype, darker than an Arkham Knight
