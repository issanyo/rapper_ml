[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Nowadays everybody try'na get on
They don't wanna put in work, they just ridin' along
Pretty ho in the videos, thighs and a thong
A few views on YouTube, but who's buyin' the song?
WorldStar don't give a fuck how your body the verse
They'll desecrate your mixtape, so Connie can twerk
With your three-sixty deal, boy, you're probably a jerk
On Molly, while he profit off your body at work
Public Enemy told me, "Don't believe the hype"
I strive to be the type to fight to lead them right
From the brainwash, same songs daily that they playin'
And if you disagree with the mass, then you're hatin'
When did conscious rap become corny?
Why should I let the corporates defy me?
Radio suckers never play me
But that's the HI 5@9, that shit is crazy

[Verse 2: Cormega]
I feel alone in a room full of people
My body of work is food for these leeches
The Devil's a lie, illusions deceive you
We'll never find truth 'til you seek it
When you're real, they look for your weakness
When you're fake, money won't change this
They blacklisted my name in the majors
Now I'm independent, reachin' new heights, thank you
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And never worth the price your soul cost
How did something so right go so wrong?
The rules were more clear when I sold raw
Taught not to sleep, but I dozed off
And woke up with dough gone, it's my own fault
I should have known better, he showed flaws
He had something up his sleeve and his nose, uh

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Came up in the game as a young buck
Put the crack down, put the guns up
Uh, funny I ain't even want much
When your money funny, then the fun's up
Sign a deal with your funds up
In the lab 'til the sun's up
'Til the label give you thumbs up
Put the ones up, dumb it down, turn the drums up
But that ain't where you come from
Our role-model sold bottles
Fuck (?), nigga livin' like it's no tomorrow
These rappers don't own shit, they Borrow
Frontin' with a mortgage and car note
Promote lust over substance
Grown man in a dress lookin' suspect
Uh, shawty used to want a rough neck
Thug nigga like baby, where the love at?

[Verse 4: Sadat X]
Now, this industry'll smash you
Go right past you
What's good today, my nigga?
How you gon' live when it's only gettin' bigger?
And the rage it bring out that nigga
But you tame that
Fall back if you got two-syndrome
Cause there is a way to get income
You work well with people, you're social
You're up on technology, the change in ecology
You can't lose quality cause then you're gone
Now, it's fuck the industry and all that misery
Don't bring that to me, my situation growin'
I'm  still here, I found a way to keep it goin'
When you hit the continents enough
You know where bread  at
And you know where you're dead at
Understand that, you can paint the picture
But you've got to have something with you
And an image that finish you

[Verse 5: Lord Jamar]
They got you livin' like a fuckin' trick
Suckin' on the devil's dick
Stuck at the level of a bitch
While those pimps get rich
Kept in tight situations like tight clothes
The cold night froze all assets
LPs and cassettes, CDs and MP3s
Three bank accounts seized
All because them pimps wasn't pleased
Hit you with small amounts, no more than 5 G's
Knowing damn well you can't survive without cheese
Coming live and direct from the den of thieves
Where niggas die for respect like the Genovese crime families
It's time we start studying degrees
Take apart all the fallacies
Pimp slapped by reality
Solicitation of my Nation for a salary
Conversation travels through the galaxies
Like shooting stars, introducing Lord Jamar
The Black Man is Allah, understand who you are!
