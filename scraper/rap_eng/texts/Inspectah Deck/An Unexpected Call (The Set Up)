[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
It was an evil day the sun glistened over the city
Shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty
I was reluctant, a ball In the pit of my gut
Like the phone call I got was just to set me up
She wouldn't do that, my love had love for the kid
So I slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib
Hit the block about 6 somth', shit got switched up
She pulled long inside and said, "Jump in the truck."
So I did, we supposed to be gone for Ziti
She made the wrong turn, I'm like, "Where you goin' to sweetie?"
Felt the heat on the back of my neck
Did a mirror check, I didn't know what to expect
I got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
I heard the DeLucas laughin' and then shit got hot
They say "Die Tony Starks, you gonna melt like a record
Never to be remembered, never to be respected

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I got word that my man got off
Rolling with Logan, I told him "Damn that broad
It’s no surprise why she would do this
Word on the streets, she had a side deal working for the DeLucas"
Word is out, APB, this bird is foul
Put a price on it — the hood searching her house
The DeLucas won't stop without merking us out
We should catch 'em while they celebrating, burst in the crowd
Tony death, shit is working me, vexed
They saying "Deck chill, it’s real and you're certainly next"
Thrown into boiling vinyl, can’t let it slide, fool
I guess it's just my time to die too
First find Logan, gotta make her talk
Who’s your boss, where’s your boss and who made the call?
Tell me or not, you’re sleeping with the fish
But first tell your boss that he will get his
