He's been taking it easy, and then suddenly the moment came
Suddenly, the moment came, watch it, and...
He has put together a flurry and put the champion away
But no one has ever been able to do that
And he's trynna survive to the final bell, what a fight

You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion

[Inspectah Deck]
I stream machine gun funk, trump slayer
Major Payne game hunter, summer time shine
Mind controller, hold the crowd still hill top dweller
Sell the garden out, House Gang chain
Cuban Link blink, lose shoes, you can never wear
Stare hard, God rise above, love hate, make your choice
Voice like Luther, future Hall of Famer
Came a long way, stay fly, I, soldier, Ayatollah
Airbender send a chill, drill sarge, hard bottom
Got 'em hooked, took my time, grind heavy
Ready for the world, girl please, he's too experienced
Been a don, Avalon size, wise to it
Do it like, Nike type gritty, city boy, 'noid never
Better recognize, eyes of the tiger
The fire breather, he the truth, son
The champion

[Sample]
You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion

[Inspectah Deck]
This is Ruger rap, clap clips, strips buzzing
Cousin got the spot a blaze, J's crisp, this time styling
Island of Stat, Black Hawk, walk with me, fifty cal flow
Blow the roof, you learn, burn unit
True it's popping, watch 'em work, purp' smoking, toke and rapping
Catch a tidal wave, slave to the rhythm, give 'em hell
Bell ringer, Springer Show, throw a chair, air it out
Doubting Deck, check your pulse, folks, witness history
Rewriting the script, switch it on 'em, taught 'em how
Now's a new day, say what? Clutch shooter
Through the storm, calm bomb, armed dangerous, spit game
Flame thrower, Cobra Commander, pandemonium, it's only him
Swim with the sharks, spark like night breeze
See plan the camera flash, cash only homey
And not jammed til the band done, the champion

You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion
