Daddy's Little Girl featuring Inspectah Deck of Wu Tang Clan and Iliana Eve

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck and Mike Smith]
Daddy's Little Girl (ahh ahhh)
Repeat 4x

[Verse 1: Iliana Eve]
She sees sex as a way of leaving hell
But she won't kiss and tell
Brenda's baby was the love of her life
Then she lost it and left Christ
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
On her way up she tripped and fell
When Brenda lost her baby it all collapsed
Now she's on her knees but not at mass...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Daddy's little girl...
Alone in this cold world, reality'll make your toes curl
She's an angel but she's caught up in the devil's hold
So the trials and tribulations made her sell her soul
So confused, she can't close the open wounds
So consumed, nothing left but the smoking fumes
Have you seen her lately? Hot like a pizza oven
I seen her meet with this pimp, I'm thinking he was Russian
They saying she's disgusting, I'm saying cease the judgement
Cause everybody plays the fool, she just needs some loving
A shell of herself, far cry from days past
She used to be the flyest girl in Ms. Jane's class
You better change fast, before you're ordered to a state max
Or your daughter choose the same path
You're hurting, you're lonely, only you can stop the hell
That's when you realize you are not for sale

[Bridge: Mike Smith, Sylvia Massy]

[Chorus]
