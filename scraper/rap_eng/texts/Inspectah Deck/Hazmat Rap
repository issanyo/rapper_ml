[Intro: Sample + Inspectah Deck]
"Just talk about—"
Put your hardhats on, we going to work
Get a little dirty

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
This is Hazmat rap, scratch that
When this is rocking see niggas droppin' like the NASDAQ stats
Black popping like a ass that's fat
Trapping that cash, on top of that I'm getting ASCAP stacks
I-N-S, I never sleep
Meaning I'mma all-nighter liver than the Tribeca streets
Untouchable, is never in your reach
Straight to the bone they call me bonafide homes, then capice

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Y'all be on that other shit this is that gutter shit
Your team be junk mail just a waste of a click
Telling me to axe somebody so I had to hack somebody
Pop a stupid question and I leave 'em with my hatchet, bloody
Rappers study and they tried to gather data from me
I earned my stripes so my wets match my rugby
Raps is ugly and all the hoodrats love me
All thugs go to heaven but no cats above me
Nah...

[Hook: Sample]
"—time for this realness"

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Fly like I'm gone in a cape
Rebel I, try blocking my pace
Get rocked in your face
Y'all old, there's homage to pay
Or catch a vist from my young G's, I don't need problem with Jake
Just, shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Give me the mic and watch a nigga display
Born penitentiary-hard, oh, my God
Yeah, I'm from the home of the mobsters, crooks, and cons

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Fuck Patrón, you need shots of Cortisone
You ain't Corleone or N.O.R.E. 'n' Capone
More like Norah Jones with your boring poems
Save that Rambo act for Stallone
That style’s got a thousand dads, mine's at an orphan's home
Smoking on the porch alone, killing it with a gorgeous tone
Flow bellissimo like I record in Rome
I’m in the water, Orca clone whaling on y'all
Rouge status, no Palin on y'all
I be back in the game, attacking lames, assailant on y'all
I’m Spidey scaling on walls
This is pharaoh biz, why your man bailin' on y'all
I be shredding like I got Eddie Van Halen on call
Hell Cycle transmission, never failing on y'all
