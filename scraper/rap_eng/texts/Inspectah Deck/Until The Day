[Verse 1]
Been a long journey, they always told me ''don't worry''
Been through so much the ways of the world don't concern me
I rise above it, can't front, sometimes I love it
Then I realized so many lives died for nothing
Picture me tricking, this is blood money, brothers was slain
Cause of the game mothers suffered the pain
Even though there was nothing to gain
We got our life on the line, everybody wants something to claim
Life struggle, all we search for is the right hustle
Fight the bubble and flex if tight muscle
And all you ask for is the one you'd like to love you
And if you say you ride, just know that I can trust you
Whole hearted cause it's so cold hearted
They are zombies, all of their souls have departed
Through the good, bad, the ugly I'm Eastwood
Trying to eat good so I can sleep good

[Hook]
When my seeds grow old and I'm weak and gray
That's a job well done so in peace I lay
Until that day comes I'mma lead the way
Won't be a stray until I see the day
When I leave the streets and earn a decent pay
When I'm feeling that peace I put the piece away
Until that day comes I'mma lead the way
Won't be a stray until I see the day

[Verse 2]
My travels acquiring knowledge, grab a handful
Shaking the dice, living life on the gamble
I won't slow up on the daily getting dough up
I probably won't live to see my reward, fuck it, so what?
I can't complain, well can he stand the rain?
Yeah, I'm sure the storm surely get a man to change
There's a lesson in everything, the best go through it
If you ready for anything let's go do it
I wanna see my niggas free out the cage
Or get blazed off of diesel and haze
They'll be amazed on how things changed
Should the youth take the blame? Time marches on
Still nothing stays the same, I'm so focused
Grabbing hold to every moment
Getting my stance, this is the chance, don't blow it
Fake none, this is what you waited for from day one
Make no mistake, son, I pray when the day come

[Hook]
