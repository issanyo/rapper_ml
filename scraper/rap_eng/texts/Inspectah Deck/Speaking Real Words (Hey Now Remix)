[Sample]
Hey now. Hey now. Hey now...
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey, hey now, hey now, don't...

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
I dust the mic like a savage
The Esoteradactyl's rap style's beyond average
To say the least, I'm slaying beasts with the right plan
I'll take your hype man and beat him with the mic stand
You're like, "Damn! I better get a resource"
I'll overpower three-fourths of your police force
You're talking to a fugitive who'll serve your crew
Fake his own death and come back to murder you
Who raps till the crack of dawn? Who's the droid
Who destroyed numerous humanoids like atom bombs?
You're nothing but a tag-a-long, that I be ragging on
7L's on the cut, while Joe is tapping on
The 3000, me I'm just lounging
Waiting for a sucker MC to start pounding
You know the deal, so check the cassette
It's Esoteric and Inspectah Deck, what you expect?

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I stash heat, creep past police on the beat
Keep it moving in the mean streets, I the black sheep
Roll deep with the Killa Beez, quick on the squeeze
Freeze! Nobody move, just hand over the G's
Gone with the breeze, everything's peace at ease
Now I'm laid back, counting stacks, twisting the trees
My rap's scorching, way beyond third degrees
Enemies get blown like autumn leaves
Authorities comb the block, I'm peeping they steez
After me cause the rhyme's worth about two ki's
And double that 'cross seas
Fiends buy off the heez, the result's more currencies
Them no worry we, I strike em down suddenly
Funny how they rush me, must be the money
You hate me or you love me, don't ever fuck me
Trust me, we can make the scene turn ugly

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
I'm like a man possessed that can't confess
Yes it's the Es' to bless, wicked test pressed to rest
Crab rapper, my raps shatter your wax platter
Esoteric's data can stab up the tracks badder
My words flow for the, rap cats who rep locally
Transmit poetry fit to hit em globally
Eso', yes status fresh from the get go
Sinister, ready to administer the death blow
On rap cats cause I'm taking it back
To a time when it was cool to call hip-hop rap
Cause I've been rapping, since fly sneakers were cheap
Since I bought 'em off Koreans down on Washington Street
Since I had a cameo; since I rocked rope chains
Since I had gold fronts with the Polo frames
Since "Goin' Way Back," since pro black rap
Since the Jungle Brothers let me know, "I Got it Like That"
