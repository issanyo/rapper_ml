[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Smooth getaway, yeah
One time on my ass (getaway)
'Bout to make this hundred yard dash...
With the cash

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I'm fleein' the crime scene on the Major Deegan
Power steerin', lost the handle and the Jeep spin
Deep in the seat, high pursuit by the precinct
My co-defendant turned state and let the beast in
They rush my old Earth lab, grabbed 50 G's cash
In the stash and let the Glock splash
Son dash down the fire escape past the weed gate
The weed gate, thought it was a sting, cocked the Tre' 8
Jakes givin' chase, now the dread's must 'scape
I was creepin' down the staircase, we met face-to-face
In the lobby, cold stares, show no fear
We out for now, but next time we might go there
Cause Po's here, must've turned down the walkie-talkie
I thought I heard one tell the other that he caught me
Damn! They got my man, he knows shit
Bitch nigga that I rolled with told shit!
I laid low, 007 'til it get dark
He told where my Wis' lives and where the whip's parked
Got my address off the license plate
That eliminate, headin' to my next restin' place
Uncertain, my Wis' peeped from behind the curtain
And seen the high-beam from the chicky lurkin'
The high-speed chase got me swervin'
I needed a diversion, crashed in the side of a Suburban
In the mirror, I'm starin' at the eyes of the law
Couldn't jump out, fucked up the drivers-side door
Called China, "Meet me in a half with the Pathfinder
No time to talk, I'll fill you in when I find ya"
Stopped at a neighborhood diner, brought me some attire
And swore to hold me down in the fire

[Hook: Inspectah Deck (Raekwon)]
(The word on the street) they can't trace my rap sheets
Still, I creep swift, tryin' to slip all heat
(The word on the street) this thing's way beyond deep
Promise me you'll keep ya mouth closed with no leaks
(What's the word on the street?) the evidence concrete
My Co-D mysteriously got set free
(The word on the street) the photographs let the beast splash Through the projects the last few weeks

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
You bein' watched like you new on the block from roof tops
Get your moves on, these hot shots pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
Hard times for Po, I can't control the masses
Scream for more, backstage, we sling V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin' mace, riots takin' place
When the Clan show they face, the fans slow they pace
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it, dun' know
Bitches get trampled, niggas wildin' in the front row
Fire Marshall catch a beat-down, tryin' to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin' rounds
Without intermission from a crouch-position
Bullets ricocheted off the strobe-light, strikin' Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition to bust back
Fuck that, them outta-town cats'll take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high-pursuit down the side street
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
And blew the head-rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, ditched the whip and then escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
Work for 5-0, swappin' info for doe

[Hook]
