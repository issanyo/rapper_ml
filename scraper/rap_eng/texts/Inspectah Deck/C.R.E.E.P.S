[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
To all those C.R.E.E.P.S. out there
Crime Regulators Eating Everday Pulling Stings
C.R.E.E.P.S...., they be out there lurking
Watching... real low key, though
Watching niggas get that dough
Just waiting, patient... gon' make your move soon
I said "Make it, don't fake it" knawImean?
Better watch yourself.. yo...

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
If you making money off, you better hold your heat
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
If you icey with the jewelry and the gold teeth
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
If you wheeling through the hood, and you overheat
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
In the streets, they king
And mean Crime Regulators Eating Everyday Pulling Stings

[Inspectah Deck]
Get low sneaks, throws in the street
Still grinding, same clothes on the whole week
Play low key, lurking through these cold streets
Stay smoking, ain't never got no weed
At the dice game, watching the bank
If it's money, then they plotting to shank, like Saw
You saw it coming, but couldn't stop it with tanks
Caught your pockets, the watch and the link, no lifers
Thrown through the fire, ain't scared of jail
Might run through your stash while you making a sale
Creeping in the gray BM, then hit you and your lady friend
For all your savings at the ATM
See them C.R.E.E.P.S. got nothing to lose
They take they ass kicking, get snuffed & bruised
Get shot, seen and certainly do 'em
Unplug the IV, and bounce out the emergency room
Still hurt from the wound, to him it's a thrill
He bout to, do it again like Sidney and Bill
He bout to, hit up the crib, for some ecstacy pills
Shot the fiend, cuz he ran to the jiggy and squealed
You can find him where the drugs be at, where it's lovely at
With the window cracked, scoping with the rusty gat
Or at the check cash', focus at your money stack
Or at the bar, where them ballers pop they bubbly at
