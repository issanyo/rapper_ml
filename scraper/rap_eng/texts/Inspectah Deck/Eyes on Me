[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
What doesn't kill you will only make you get even, aiyo

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck w/ ad-libs]
Everybody talking now, everybody eyes on me
You know how it's going down, you know how I ride, my G

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm bout to air it out, I don't care about
On lookers in the way, son, clear 'em out
And watch your mouth, or get pounded out
That's without a doubt, the hard way, you found it out
So walk it out, trynna chalk it out
Find yourself with your top row falling out
It's the fallout, and I'm all out
Want it bad with the kid, then call it out
It's on now, it's going down
I'm headchecking like jail niggas on the count
You wanna shout, you balling out
Codename: Paperboy, I stay on the route
Large amounts, I lost the count
Don't be hating, don't be jealous, that's how the baller bounce
I blow 'em out, I show 'em how
What you talking bout, clown, what's it all about?

[Chorus 2X]

[Inspectah Deck]
What you know about, how I throw it down
It's one tenth of my strength, son, I'm holding out
Big blowers out, big hoes about
G Code it out, hazed up, blow an ounce
Then I comb the town, got my toters now
Forever focused, never knowing when a foe's around
I stand overground, my soldiers down
You don't like it, it's the truth, how it suppose to sound
You broken down, I hold my ground
You never thought it like next, but it's over now
I'm posing proud, I'm open now
In the unisex bathroom smoking pounds
Scoping down, a golden brown
Brooklyn queen looking like she down to roll up out
I blow 'em out, I show 'em how
What you talking bout, clown, what's it's all about?

[Chorus 2X]
