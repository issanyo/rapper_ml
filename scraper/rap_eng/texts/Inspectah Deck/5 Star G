What you sippin', ma? (What you smokin', huh?)
{Henny, Louis and Don} Meet me at the bar
{Fruit colors a charm} (Got it by the jar, chea)
{We five stars over here}

Camel on their Yankee sign, on the daily grind
New York state of mind, rugged, but my lady fine
Fly face, waist 8 or 8, rocking all the late designs
Stepping like, ya'll don't waste my time
On that Mary J., looking for some 'real love', say you both
Got somebody, knowing you gon' still fuck, plus dudes
Smother you, don't he make you feel tough
Why he suprised when he realize she feel cuz, really though
Daddy king size, with a mean stride
You ain't seen live, you fucking with these guys
She fly on the G-side, sex is a weapon
There's a .357 in her Levi's
What you sippin', ma? How you doing, huh?
The way you shine, girl, you looking like a shooting star
She by the bathroom, scope on the soldier hard
I pull strings, no guitar

New Ro (Roset) {Bottles popping off}
{Popping off all night with some model broads}
(Chea) {We five stars over here}

[Inspectah Deck]
Nothing but cases out, shutting tables down
Pay-per-view style, million dollar faces out
Hating ain't allowed, so played out, fuck
What they say about, I & I, what they saying now
I'm a General, you ain't earned a stripe yet
I'm the type to cop and go, ya'll the type to price check
Different colored cards in my wallet I ain't swiped yet
Man, I got a rack of broads, I don't even like yet
Yeah, I'm a rude boy, I ain't you, boy
I got the money and the girl and the cool toys
I"m confident and two boys, ladies call it ooh baby
Ecstasy, not the pill, true joy
Shorty got a thing for me, she be like
INS, you can be that king for me
Feel what I feel, hit the bar, have a drink with me
You say that shit, girl, but she say she only think of me, link with me
