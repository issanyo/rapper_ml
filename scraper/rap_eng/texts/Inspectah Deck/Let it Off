[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Premo
What's good, I got you big homie
INS ya highness

[Sample]
"Now it's time to introduce..."

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
East side to west side, everybody set, ride
Beantown to S.I., they fiend for the next high
Lean with the red eye, mean with the MI
Rhyme sharper than the lightbeam on a jedi
Supreme, why test I?
Indeed, I rep mine
Agreed, minor leaguers fatigue, try next time
World War 4 whenever Deck rhyme
Physical grind, no subliminal, call me on direct line
Hens fly after next guy
I at best buy, shorty like "Let's ride"
Took me on a sex drive
NY creep, like Boz, Chilli and Left Eye
Don't sweat mine, move from the gate
Brothers respect mine
Cool with the broads (yes I'm)
Movin it hard (yes I'm)
Truest to do it, whoever dispute it, you wreck time
Yes I, leave your head twisted like a red tie
Deck amphetamines, they fiendin for the next line

[Scratched Hook]
"I let it off" [3x]
"Set it off"
"I...I let it off" [3x]
"Recognize the king, the livest team"

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
North side to south side, I'mma stay about my, biz
Fucking outcry, in while you outside
Vader make your brain fry
Greater than a Dane I
Take over your lane, I'm Dock Ellis when I aim high
Shame how ya abandoned a band and a witness stand and
Then randomly reprimand him, Esoteric is insane
I stay rope chain fly, pterodactyl hang glide
Bill O'Reilly, kill a grave, feel like you're the same guy
You like watching paint dry
Switch it up on dumb joints
I run point, I find, I motivate and let my sons voice
N'ahmean?
Are you the youngest on the track of Preme
Tractor beam rap regime, A-O-T-P, that's the team
I Reggie Lewis from the key, solidify the sucker free
Critics pretty much agree this shit is gutter luxury
This is Skywalker fam, Jack Kirby free hand
I ainâ€™t with the dark side
7 let them cuts ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Premier, spin it back
I'm in it in a minute flat
Dissed cats love it, and they ain't even into rap
Rhymes on ya mind like a fitted cap
What I spit is crack
Salutations, see him, tip your hat
Man, he been a mac, he ain't gotta ask where the bitches at
Picture that: thick chicks sittin in his lap
He a diplomat, VIP status and he strip em at
Alien flow, gettin visits from the men in black

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Anybody want it they can get it
Call the medevac, transporter, manslaughter
You don't want to set it, Jack
Vet'll clack, you won't even leave with your head attached
Back pedal and pedal back, these rap rebels will turn you to scrap
Metal and burn up your back meadow and murder the track
Revel in the fact, when devils attack
We live with the flack, with the powerful lines
Shit on your hood like a feral cat
I'm out of my mind

[Outro: Skit]
