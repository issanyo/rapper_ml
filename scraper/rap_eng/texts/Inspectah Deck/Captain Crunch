[Intro]
Their instructor is speaking

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Eatin' Captain Crunch for lunch, don't get your panties in a bunch
Shorty passed out, he coulda put the whammy in the punch
Had he a hunch, he could get set up like one Cosby
Slidin' off of three snowflakes like Tom Bosley
Remember Charlie's Angels? They had to make some changes
Three broads with burners, these dames could get dangerous
Dude you never see will forever remain nameless
Two of them things black, the last one's stainless
Don't deal with the Devil on a deep level
They see metal and sound off like a tea kettle
Blow the spot up lovely
With no reference to skin color, God don't like ugly
Wise man once said not to showboat
And treat the yacht the same way as a rowboat ("here!")
The snakes'll hang theyself with they own rope
And watch a jewel transform to a known quote

[Chorus]
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
What's Mary Poppin', y'all? Shout to Michael Rooker
You with a mic is like a eunuch with a hooker
Pressure (pressure pressure) cooker
My Konfusion's Organized, I'm the lord of light
Yondu with an arrow's like Eso with the cordless mic
Flow holy, no gospel trap, writin' like
Michael Crichton put the rap in Velocirap-tor, or
I hit you like a trap, door, when it rains it pours
No mental strains but I, stick out like Kurt Angle's temple veins
You got an empty brain, enter in my lane
It takes balls like a gender change, people talkin' out they ass
Check for the double-cross like 2 Chainz at Sunday mass
Hit you with the belly to belly, the suplex
Off the roof of the duplex, willin' to group text
With Steely Dan, Groot, fuckin' baby Groot, the ghost of Dave Brubeck
Alex Trebek and Boba Fett, who's next?

[Chorus]
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in
(Ahh, welcome welcome)

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
They can't handle the pressure, tryn'a handle Inspectah
'Cause I eat 'em up faster than Hannibal Lecter
Couldn't plan it no better, try me, you know better
I will fuck money up, Spike Lee in "Mo' Better"
Choose your battles more wisely, I wouldn't suggest you provoke
I stunt your growth like cigarette smoke
(It keeps going) I'm talkin' effortless flow
I tell the truth, the whole truth, so let the record show
I went from corner to corner, took it block to block
Came from under the rock, rock bottom to top
It's like New York City cab style, picture me stopped
They gon' catch it like a fish when it officially drop
Just pre-order the slaughter, when you give it a listen
There'll be so many bars, we'll give you visions of prisons
So many haters among us, though I never surrender
I'm like Jeremy Renner, silent weapon, Avenger

[Chorus]
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in

[Outro]
They call him CZARFACE, and man's worst enemy
(Oh, what's happening?)
CZARFACE head on with one of the meanest mugs
In the galaxy: the Chrome Bearer
(Man oh man, we are in trouble)
Make sure your hoodie is on, and your boots laced
This adventure will keep you at the edge of your seat
CZARFACE, the baddest one man army to hit town
Always where the action is
CZARFACE, rated R
