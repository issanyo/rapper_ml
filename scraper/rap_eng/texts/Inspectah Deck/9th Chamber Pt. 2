[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here

[Inspectah Deck]
Blue and white, Yankee fit, HG's, they the shit
A-list, the basic, the basement, the greatest shit
Prototype, show you right, high roller type
Fly over night phenom, recon soldier type
In the street, been a beast, industry entity
The remedy, my chemisty, the synergy, is meant to be
INS, Max Payne, pump through, the track vein
Make the move, act strange, fold 'em like, crack pain
Black bang, lick 'em down, guns don't, make a sound
Thirty eight, danger pound, everybody, gangsta now
I'mma ride, I don't hide, get mine, bottom line
Big time, papa shine, stop mine, you out your mind
D twelves, hold me dubs, females, show me love
Stunting, son? Know he was, blunted, son? Know he buzzed
Quarter G, fresh kicks, quarter P, fresh piff
Corner don, what I'm on, always be, that next shit

[Hook: Nas sample (Inspectah Deck)]
Pay homage, respect, acknowledge the rep
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
(Honor the vets, still causing a threat
Knocking heads, no problem to Deck)
Pay homage, respect, acknowledge the rep
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
(I'm INS, braveheart in my chest
I don't follow, I don't mob with the rest)

[Inspectah Deck]
Killa Bee Part 3, RP Trilogy
Heartbeat, feeling me, pa be, still a G
Moshpit, mob shit, bomb like, Saddam hit
Armed with, the hottest shit, Human Torch, arsonist
Burn baby, burn it down, two step, turn around
Who that, hurt 'em now, Park Hill, murder town
Stat boy, that boy's, lord on the track
Boy, you 'roid on your back, boy, you 'noid off the track, boy
Franken-rhyme, monster mash, napalm, bomb the mass
Blaze a line, bong of hash, stay calm, start to spaz
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em up, heads nod, listen up
Split a dutch, bitch what, this is us, get in touch
Concrete jungle-list, stomp beats, thunderist
From on the streets, busting clips, to palm trees, loving it
Your highness, survivalist, wireless, pirate
My shit, ride for this, the cure for this, virus

[Hook]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Yes, you have now been taken to the dungeons of rap
Where the weak MC's don't make it back
You have signed your pact, with your fate
The dungeons...
