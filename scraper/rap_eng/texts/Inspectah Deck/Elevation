[Intro (whispered) x15]
Elevation

[Hook]
Tired of trials and tribulations
It seems like life is Hell, dream's the only way of escapin'
To worlds that's beyond imagination
I know a place, I could take you there through elevation

[Verse]
Where I come from, young ones pump jums for lump sums
Bustin' guns, trust none, become son
Crews fells from loose shells that propel where I'm dwellin'
Niggas jail, tellin' what you sellin'
My nigga Tone just came home, been in fo' 5
The system tried to give him 5 more for gettin' high
Fly Stacy, daddy's little lady fucks crazily
Baby after baby, lost her shape as of lately
Used to spend the quiet nights home, now she likes to roam
Feelin' quite grown, caught in life's cyclone
I was taught be the wise "apply the knowledge passed"
To advance, learn the science of life and earn the masters
Trapped in the havoc, I'm forced to go the whole
Although, it might spell a jail cell and no parole
I fight with the force of Steve Austin
Until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
In this ghetto Heaven, God bless the children
Whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
We don't believe in Heaven, we livin' in Hell
Tryna escaped, but fate's sealed in the bomb shell
Feelin' Like Hewey Newton with Panther Plots
But high-tech surveillance got my moves on watch
So, I drop jewels, use the music to educate
Can't celebrate till we elevate

[Hook]
