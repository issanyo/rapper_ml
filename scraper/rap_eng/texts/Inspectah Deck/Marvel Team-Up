[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, 7L—yo, Es, man, y'all niggas ready?
I'm back at it man
Mad scientist flow
In the laboratory on some Frankenrhyme shit
Bring shit to life on 'em

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Call me your worst nightmare
Watch the birds take flight, take life, every verse I air
Guaranteed I deliver it hot (like what?)
Domino's, feet up, chilin' in your spot, vámonos

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Meaning leave, beat it, you can see that he's heated
And the E-S feel the same, that's why we remain seated
Keep the lab dusty like the day after D-Day
Spiders die of old age here, and three stay

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Raw like Columbian white
Stay buzzin', hey cousin, they ain't nothin', all my numbers is right
Red dragon from the dungeon of rap
Dark flames set free, truthfully…

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
…these emcees are lame, and they should be illegal
Like buckin' at a bald eagle
I've got the ego of Evel Knievel, you weak and feeble
I'm Beanie Sigel if he was one of the Beatles
And possessed the DNA of Magneto
So fuck, fuck your people

[Sample Dialogue]

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
It's Eddie Brock, I'm Peter Parker, and
We can rock black until they make something darker, and
We back to building inside the Baxter Building
Private location, dykes, no hibernation
No Michael Myers or Jason…

[Verse 5: Inspectah Deck (Esoteric)]
…your highness the great one
Took the heads off the livest of brave ones
Lord of the Underground, dumbing them out
With a crowd of a hundred thou, bow to the sound
The Archangels sing, the God's name will ring
Frontliners upon us, we're made of king
INS do it to death, like the rudest exec
Who's next, who's foolish to test?

[Verse 6: Esoteric]
Who's stupid? And 'fess
Stand back and Google it, yes
If opportunity presents we commin' through to your rest
Beautiful mess, tool to your chest
This a Marvel team-up, who would've guessed?
Ah, not you - you don't know
Not you, either…
(Just a spark, though)
