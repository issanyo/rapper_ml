[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
The only time they go hard is when they having sex
Six-shotter Smith, hotter then the dragon's breath
Original Dark Knight I’m Adam West
My chick notice the burn she like Sharon Gless
Deck's official, got a whistle and pin stripes
Be Smooth B, everything Greg Nice and heads like
Son, take performance enhancers
Barry Bond flow, so they talking outlandish

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
The Glock that I brandish put my thoughts on the canvas
7L made the beat, CZARFACE doing damage
The god of chaos, his squad is way off
Rap life, sweatsuit, not a day off
Stay off the dilly, the bars is silly, guard your grilly
I'm barking rappers like Sir Charles in Philly
I'm wild down the back like a rotary phone
The wolf pack's back tell them coyotes we home

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
I’m that Ketel I’m that Grey you that bottom shelf
I’m not God fearing I’m God himself
You travelling light I’ll be waiting with your vocals on
You ain't  paint a picture man that’s a photobomb
I crop you out my mission murder everything
You do it natural like Ken Griffey swing
Then you out of the park yea it’s a powerful thought
Rough sound sound like bloodhound when they bark
I got snipers that will mount you in the dark

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
No sound of the spark goldfish fuck around with the sharks
No bitch no cowards at heart no matter how big a part
No second thoughts i was down from the start
Go shuffle like a victory elves or you scary fools
Body froze up the rows I could barely move
Rarely loose seen me stuntin' in the daily news
Verbal intercourse curl your toes like fairy shoes

[Interlude]
Don't worry about him that guy is dumber than
The barrel with hammers at the bottom of the frozen lake
I know your kind I read the details
And see you on tv in a couple more games
You can explain no I do no explaining around here
I would foot my lace so far up your behind
You going to wonder why your mouth taste like boots
Seriously though

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Sold it to the guards shit is overcharged
Throw the bars this way you know we large
'Bout to take it to a new plateau, you rap slow
You know the fucking pterodactyls swooping it
Dance with them pen Daien and activate
The mother fucking shit a ten and don’t pretend
That you dont know the name and you dont know the rep
You look dumb like Greg Focker when he overslept
Slow your step flow, it's pimped out like just a custom model
Fram the fight like Cus D'Amato
I get so much fan mail due to these verses
I gotta block letters like I can't write cursive

[Interlude]
Wow, what is it y’all
It’s real, it's what they asked for
It’s real, it's what they jam for
Wow, what is it y’all
It’s real, it's what they asked for
It’s real, it's what they jam for
Wow, what is it y’all
(Can you hear me ok, George?)
7L, Esoteric, Rebel INS, your highness
(You must choose your oxygen destroyer)
(What will become of us? And what will become of us if the weapon system they now have falls into the wrong hand?)
Apocalypse wild
(Don't you have a responsibility no man has ever gotten)
Right now

[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
When I’m on the scene drama is routine
I mean it’s gonna take the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines
I’m a monster, fuck shit up - my middle name
I'mma mash out your posse like Danze and Lil 'Fame
No block in my lane, King Kong style
Playing handball with the choppers and planes
When the beast is released I’m coming through the streets
Crushing million dollar highrises under my feet
While walking through explosion blowing up tanks
To reciprocate the notion showing no emotions
Nothing left behind just a path of destruction
Aftermath I’m the wrath I conduct it
Hustling the city beating on my chest like
You want me - come and get me, you frontin' me is risky
I’m Godzilla with bars, the God's illa' with bars
It ain’t real 'til you feeling the scars
I’m Godzilla- I’m Godzilla with bars-
The Godzilla- The Godzilla- Godzilla- Godzilla- Godzilla-
I’m Godzilla- I’m Godzilla with bars-
The Godzilla- The Godzilla- Godzilla-

[Verse 7: Esoteric]
Hey yo, yo, hey yo, check one two and you don't quit
My name is Esoteric y'all I'm the ulti-yo, yo
Check one two and you don’t quit
My name is Esoteric y'all I'm the ultimate
Ey yo thought you were switching places
IQ is triple sixes
Our tools are too malicious
Humans are too delicious
I got my head up in the cloud and my feet in Brooklyn
Keep pushing, I flip tacks like seat cushions
I'm wild, I'm giant I'm king sized
I’m 90 Yao Mings tall, I'm 50 Fat Joes wide
Yea the 93 versions these person don't need a surgeon
Keep searching for the bodies deep beneath the earth and
My footprint is bigger than Fenway Park
When they start shooting I will end they heart
My pen stay smart your pen dumb and dull
Numb to your numbers, you a numbnuts numbskull

[Verse 8: Inspectah Deck]
You spitting lyrical and leave the mic on critical
And make the crowd get physical
We a bishop too we don’t hit you with that bull shit
We just stick to the principles
So we [?] some fools, whip through 'em with the clip full
We far from the typical we a bishop too
We don’t hit you with that bull shit
We just stick to the principles

[Interlude]
You goin' to the authorities describing a guy in prehistoric
One that spits fire and they just put you away for a long time
But we saw them captain you saw them those monsters
They are real I know just when to keep my mouth shut
Have another drink mr bishop I don’t want anymore
We got to report what we see captain don’t you understand
They are two of the most monstrous
Creatures any man has ever seen

[Verse 8: Esoteric]
Inhuman voice and black boys poll they don’t get it
2015 rappers bang on Reddit
Sit your ass down like a Marvel end credit
The bonus scene's next when your whole team get wrecked
You need to spark up a spliff to get they bars up
While I’m lifting cars up this the wrong tree to bark up
I carve up a hollywood actor in back of Starbucks
And hopped out the dumpster all bloody
You feeling star struck
Because the star struck his body is like storm shadow
Pulling off in an escalator and I follow the star truck
Then another czar cut every day I’m hustling
That's word to Rick Ross and his bizzare cut
Yes Mars what
Here’s a large cup of the puke I barfed up
And it's still more appealing than your shit 'cause it's horseshit
You got your wheel spinning but you leave no treads
Like a broken moped your whole [?] for cokeheads
And Broke heads with no bread
You get brave then catch Heat like Javy López
I be Merker, I’m spazzing like my arm
Hosting the ghost of Tom Glavine
You so hood but go wood like log cabins
(We going right in)
My execution is sharper, than tools from Brutus the Barber
A shark is loose in the harbor, and yes I'm proving I'm smarter
Than Isaac Asimov and Garry Kasparov
Come marry [?] like David Hasselho- Ha ha I can’t even finish that
You put the pin in that
You happy? Now where the fuck are my cynics at
Turn off your smartphones they trying to enslave us
I got bars I should write for cats like Jim Davis

[Outro]
Write for cats for cats yea I know
For your case It’s fast like a car chase
I want to join your group
Kids out there running that shit
If they just let me see her you seem like  a blunt
And the thing is you know a lot of people
Were so stupid how to meet them up with some medly
It can be handicapped but you did
And just imagine if my man Beethoven
Had a fucking sampler
Exactly if he had DJ’s
