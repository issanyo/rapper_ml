"Maybe I owe you something"

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm not the champagne dinner time, spend the night, dim the lights
More like the boots on, sex you right, bet ya bike
She said, don't stop, daddy, make my boat rock
Whoa ma, you so hot, let me that row drop
Ahh yeah, get it girl, ready, switch position, girl
Doggystyle, rip ya curls, make that body, twist and twirl
Work it out, it's your world, know that I don't lick the pearl "Maybe I owe you something"
And I can too collect it, I don't except no credit
Here's how you clear ya debit, slide out the skirt and set it
Mami already naked, ready and fish netted
I'm bout to work you breathless, I try not to hurt you precious
First let me roll the purple, then I return to serve you
For you, like you deserve to, the fire burn eternal
Later she hook the plate up, hoping that I would stay but "Maybe I owe you something"
She be doing it, doing it, doing it well
And she was doing just fine, til she blew up my cell
I ain't fronting, I'm still checking, she a beautiful belle
She like, roleplaying, got a jungle room at the 'tel
She the type that have you creep nights, and fucked up your home
When it comes to that man shit, you stuck on your own
I know you game me all your love and got nothing to show
But yo "Maybe I owe you something"
She gleam with the latest on, jeans look painting on
I pushed up crazy strong, grinding to a reggae song
We broke at the break of dawn, blazed on the neighbor's lawn
I gave 'em all, later on, and skated cuz my paper called
Stagged off the peach Snap', damn son, I beast that
Shorty she a free stack, where do they teach at?
Plus she got the deep cat, know I had to creep back "Maybe I owe you something"
Just name a spot or place, make sure you rock your lace
Whatever, stockings, hey, it don't matter, you're hot as plain
Her nigga's locked away, that's why she out to play
I tell her "not today", and she ready to cock and spray
She do what poppa say, and I ain't got to say
And all she say is "let me ride" like she Dr. Dre
One day she flip the script, told me I got to pay "Maybe I owe you something"

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
We don't shred no paper, we don't even get down like that
You looking hot and all that mami, but you know
We just blow the back, get it smacked, and that's that
And it's a wrap.. you dig? I'm still checking for you though
Hahaha, I.O.U. "Maybe I owe you something"
