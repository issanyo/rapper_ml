Pt. 1: Album Intro

[Intro: Sample]
The story you're about to see, occured along the main
Trading route, on the border between the North and South…
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village

[Verse: RZA]
What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f… listen
Tryin to tell y'all niggas, give you a fair warnin
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!

Pt. 2: In the Hood

[Intro: Masta Killa]
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood
You find the best woman looking good
Diamond, she need polishing
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood; 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a ho on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder

[Verse 3: Streetlife]
This is the place where thugs is born
In the hood – Blink to long ya life is gone
In the hood – Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
In the hood – Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
In the hood – African's be drivin' cabs
In the hood – In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops
In the hood – The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
In the hood – Babies born addicted to drugs
In the hood – We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin'
In the hood – It ain't all good, repent or you sinnin'

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang] (x2)
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder
