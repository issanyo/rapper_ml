"What do you think of my powers now?"

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Wonder twin powers activate
Form of: some fly shit
Y'all recognize
CZARFACE

[Hook]
He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
He don't hear em out, he just air em out
He just fuck it up, it's like if really there's a doubt
The beat'll beat em down, it's leakin in your town
It's hotter than that summer time heat that's in the south
Hands up in the air, my fam up in the square
I'm Dirty at the Grammys, crash your glamorous affair
Spazzin' on the air, smash em with the flair
With the bad South American that's dancing in the chair
Get ya weight up, my pay stubs heavy like Dwight
Hens fight for what I said on the mic, put your threat on the mic
Ask around, clown, rebel is nice
Fuck your money, I said it for spite, son I'm ready to strike
Tear it down, I'mma tear it down
Them haters had a lot to say, I don't hear 'em now
I don't hear a sound, I just hear the crowd
I'm surgically performing like the doctor in the house

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Put me on some anti-homicidal meds so I ain't got a lot of feds
Whip backs and spider heads, I'm Peter Parker by the ledge
This is ultra-violence, I'll tie em to the spiderwebs
Write forever trying to keep it together like whites with dreads
Heavyweight, that's what the title says, leave you limbless like a pez
You can suck my dick, beat my nuts, psycho les
I butcher beats like a psycho les
Every visual is Trent when he's bent, yeah, higher Rez
Out for the CREAM, we all about the dream
From Shaolin to the bean, y'all be bowin' to the team
And now we on the scene, they wonder how it's a regime
But check the howitzer, gun powder like marines
I'll smack ya face, bruise your ribs, crack ya legs, it's brutal kid
Stay ahead of snakes, like Medusa did, lose your wig
Act like you're sitting down to dinner, I'll remove your lid
Prove I'm big, air em out, we don't care who it is

[Hook]
