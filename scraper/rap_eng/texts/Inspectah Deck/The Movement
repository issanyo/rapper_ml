Ye-yeah
Smooth like a green Caddy, ya fiend badly
Heads spin like Giovanni's on the Navi
Hammers spit, quick as the darts, niggas part
Like the Red Sea, test me, I'm sick with the art
Been held back, it's either rap or sell smack
Black Knight like Martin Lawrence run tell that
It's the I-N-S-P-E-C-T-A-H
Livin' life on the line, I hope I see daybreak
This is ground level, rounds echo out the Special
Be easy, U.D.'s out to get you
Throw it in the smash (so fast)
Known to spaz (go ass)
We like strippers makin' niggas (throw cash)
Smoke the blue green (call it topaz)
Fake thugs (hold ass)
You be the next rapper (fallin on ass)
Wanna measure my size? I rise above the norm
The urban icon ridin' on the eye of the storm, fool

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
All my people from the front to back
If you want it like that just.. MOVE!
Get ill, no time to chill
Yo, you feel what I feel then.. MOVE!
Girlfriend, you love how it sounds
Put ya drink down and.. MOVE!
COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!

[Inspectah Deck]
What ya do now, put ya loot down
You can bet it on the new sound
Heavy like a Hummer on deuce pounds
True hounds, on the loose in ya town
Bound to the move the crowd, it's The Movement (you down?)
Scream at the top of ya lungs
Pop one for Aaliyah, Left Eye, BIG, 'Pac and Pun
Ride with me shotgun, rock with son
Heads bop to the drums, still shocked and stunned
Come alive y'all, gangsta like white walls
On the blue Snoop Deville, watch ya eyeballs
Blade stay choppin' the track, game top of the pack
I spit flames y'all acknowledge the fact
Find out Big Rug get it poppin' like that
Throw it down like Stackhouse, cockin' it back
So ladies? Is you wit me now? Don't fake down
Everybody brace yaselves, it's a shakedown

[Hook]

[Inspectah Deck]
I do this for dough, but it's really for love
Feel me, it's love for hot girls, willies and thugs
My groups cross seas, call us junglin' thugs
And it's sure to move ya feet like a gun in the club
I blaze like a ounce and a half, stay countin' the cash
For all lames that doubtin' my craft
He's no pretender, he won't surrender
(He's a rebel) Don't y'all remember?
A major player in the game
Play the frontline, ain't afraid to make a change
I stay way beyond range
So far from the norm my code name's Doc Strange
Now get down with the get down
Sendin' missles to all my dogs in the big house
Make 'em wig out, Spiderman still on the web
Log on like ya clickin' the mouse, yeah!
