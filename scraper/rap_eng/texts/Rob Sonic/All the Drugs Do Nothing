[Verse 1]
Please check our review
Sorry we can't market you
Back to bed next to ledge
The chia pet and garden tools
Dial a booze with ginger ale
Hollow rooms with missing mail
Thinking of machine and sipping lean cuisine with Christian Bale
Thinning herds pluck the wings
Edit it for younger things
Predators that gesture for your necklaces and onion rings
Restless nights on satin sill
Get it right or pass the bill
To the left what’s in the box your Mrs Marple wrapping films
Sad to skill cronies cold
Bobby bring them bowling bowls
Full of gin the wool is thin the wolf is in the tony hole
Only talk when spoken to
No one really noticed you
Sitting in electric chairs with weapons bared and open wounds
Show you through the roping as you're coasting through the great escape
Officer this gentleman just pretzel thinned your mayonnaise
Day to day, check to check
Let's just get this money sty
Easter Egg your burglars
Your worshipers get money how
What he got magnificence
Culture clash a steamer truck
Bubble gum a couple ones and tickets to the breeder's cup
Steal the stuff that's in the soul
DT’s from the fender bends
Shake it like a Polaroid and throwing coins off Everest

Peppermint Patty got her fingers on his trigger now
Meta didn’t attract me, getting splashy till her tits were out
Buzzin' round the mountain with a pocket full of EpiPens
Plugged into the faithless as the ancients summoned Benny's jet

[Bridge]
Bennies, uppers, speed, downers, weed, speed, bennies, uppers. [2x]

[Hook]
You can raise the bar
You can call the ball
You can make the moves or do nothing at all
You could be a part of a much greater cause
And then fake it till you make it till your paint is coming off [2x]

[Verse 2]
Blaffo biffo all the same
When the break starts taking you for all your eggs
And the tax man tell ya that you’re talking strange
And wanna know if you're really on the Boston Braves
When the mighties are moved by the car you drive
And the pirates approve of your hall of crimes
And the eye of the tiger gets saucer sized
When wifey is all up in your decline
Mighty likely a crooked court
Start writing all for your book report
Crossing the states with a brick of Bjork
You can sniff till you’re stiff and your kicks are caught
Pictures poured over open ice
At the polls like bitch I just voted twice
Does it really even matter when the over riots
Go from proud to a fucken clown overnight?
