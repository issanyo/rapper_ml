[Hook x2]
With a brief adjustment
To you I haven't trusted
Everything is now [?] I can breathe or feel
Or is it nature in the ways that are supposed to be forgone
Eventually the anesthetics keep the secrets sealed

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Extreme polluted stream
Technicolor dreams
Next to empty hanging on by fingertips
Exile in bungalows where the fungus grows
Redwood tall like elevator cables burnt by handheld
No torch almost the last strand luckily
Exiting is early
Entering is late
While needless seem to be happen at the right time
I'm inside out and I can use a convoy up in convo
Instead of being told when to shit by some Republican tomboy
That mutual sense of no time is in the universe getting angry
And spirits is about to make themselves noticed
Out of focus should be known to eyes grown bogus
And your ideas float on the back of locusts
Though I rave in cusps 'cuz the anesthesia make believe
So easy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Yes I do rely on the peaceful days
To balance the seesaw that we all share
There's too much room but you'll say there's not enough elbows
So I play Mr. Velcro and stick to what I know
And if I can hold on tight the G-force I will endure
Come out dizzy with my hand bust and my eyeballs on the floor
And get the shakes from a liquor poison
[?] by the professor [?] of finite
My uncle's zone was twilight
My aunt she has a place amongst the planetary bodies
No antics
Have it your way you'll uproot my botanics for bionics
Take for granted that my sonic sensories elongate
The days and nights also decades and centuries
No more eons only ions
I'm easily prepared for the molotoved mahjong

[Hook x4]
