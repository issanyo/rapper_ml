[Intro]
Beatin' on those pots and pans
Beatin' on those pots and pans

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Yo, it's the worst case caught to die
Both aside, door set
The jack/coke balance slant left you slumlord
Sort drape, paper weight, mortified, horn
Alabi, Alan tried, conducive
Hemorrhage from a war, worry about all
Pepperidge, gun support, hurry down, fall
Ain't a lot happy
Painted lock shut
Mystified stupor
Mr. Five-ten
Ninja god envious punctured marks
Through the inflated garble at the luxoured parts
She-bop busy bought in grandma seed park
Hammerstein, ball-peen, your mean riff
Frigid day lose of the roof nail chip
Killer break loose from the two-trail switch
Sans a rock, cape budget
Lancelot, grey mustard
Man forgot that he wasn't here from day one

[Hook]
All of these locks are not enough
(Too many people in one place!)
They even hear me through the wall
(Too many people in one place!)
There to remind me that I'm stuck
(Too many people in one place!)
On the short end of a long haul
(Too many people in one place!)

Sniffs for dust, skin, I'm in chaos
Leave it to us
Future sights, stadium
Major's crew favorite
Labor too, take the grit
Just enough people to pull out the root
Boss to promenade
Blitz a wolf, sheep shirt
Feet first landing on a serious, are you?
Worn out, copper-like, water tap, pardon that
Part of that, dismal cardiac trend
Greyhounds tooth pattern, flat nail drive
Convince customary merchandise
First in flight, but the last inside
Spray that crock 'til the jaundice dies
Trains piloted by computers now
The same make a model that'll break down self
And blame is estranged, like my wife who became (Who became)
Scared when I started talking to myself (Talking to myself)

[Hook]
All of these locks are not enough
(Too many people in one place!)
They even hear me through the wall
(Too many people in one place!)
There to remind me that I'm stuck
(Too many people in one place!)
On the short end of a long haul
(Too many people in one place!)

So what I did, I'll keep it brief
(Too many people in one place!)
And at the risk of sounding blamed
(Too many people in one place!)
I wrote a letter to myself
(Too many people in one place!)
And signed it "get out while you can"
(Too many people in one place!)
