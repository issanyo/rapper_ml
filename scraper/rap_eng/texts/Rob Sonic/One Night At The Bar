[Intro]
I don't care much for smoking weed
You know I'm a man of a different breed
I don't thrive on drinking alcohol
I'm feeling much too tall
Getting high... getting high... getting high...
And I don't mean I'm getting stoned

[Verse 1: ALASKA]
Swallow back a shot of Jamie aimed to keep it poppin'
Been drinking since the whistle blew perusing all my options
Barhoppin' posse up the crews been exhilarated
Celebrating anything that comes to mind elevated
Glasses say "Salud" a little lewd, that's expected
Especially mixing booze with the fools that I'm friends with
Wylin' for the moment for the little flip ringtone
Knowing it's my home-girl we used to have this thing going
Actually we dated for a year or so, so here we go
The drama portion forcing a scenario
The subject's touchy, it still fucks with me a little bit
Steaming got me screaming in the streets like an idiot

[Verse 2: WINDNBREEZE]
It's too dark and murky
Worried by them next rounds
Half black and fucking fully confused

What's not there
