[Chorus]
I want a riot but no one else thinks that
Last call for quiet but no one else drinks that

Last call for quiet but no one else drinks that

[Verse 1]
Rusted in a machine shop means I [?]
[?] than a sidearm [?] proxy
[?]
Pamphlet of waste proof [?] proof [?]
Speak to no [?] playing tag jewelry
Rock Candy [?] pays it back through teeth
Indirect super-[?]
A bottle of perception in the other [?] trapped
Just the right sedatives measuring [?]
The nine volt [?] that's never ready
The [?] holds fast times with the [?]
The gyro migrate to Ellis iv

Nowhere [?] fisher kings bridges blind spot
Soda can, riverstink, drifting dry-dock
Now show your hands if you think your just livestock

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
[?] back to bothering you
Suffocate one after hollering to[two?]
[?] water waiting after tolerant snooze
[?] with a pokerface your father gave you
Never-ending [?] bone dry [?]
License to officiate your own buybacks
Siphoning the fifty states [?] and the collective plate [?]
[?] on a radio curse
[Centerlane?] wagon let the radio fly
Just the same tragic indication of the first time you knew you wouldn't care if the radio died
Ratio, medivac, renovate sound
Cameo letterbox getting knocked down
Safe below second Ave [Act?] generate [?]
The tapes will show that in fact yesterday's now

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
No grass grow while watched
No class [Know?] a job
No new weather [?] Never call nothing safe
Fucking hate mower gas, frustrate, overcast
[?]
Wherewithal, lope around, show the [Sound?]
Sickening [?] drop pottery [Via?] comradery
So [?] listening
Boot Shop [lengthening?]
[?] christening
And Powerball lotteries
Now weâ€™re all constantly [?]
Stay the same
In a trench
With a benchmark quality
Solemnly [?]
Confused roll on
Want shoes, dope songs
Is not robbery
Can't see the city from the smoke plume
What to do about a leader that want us to trip mushrooms
[cloud?] like Sydney, [?] Eleanor canvas at the EMU,Whitney
Rob got detonator, organ [elastrator?], forged on elevators taking you with me
Never wrong, Ten stacks [strata zone?] [?] worked in the favor until the vapor rub Vicks me
