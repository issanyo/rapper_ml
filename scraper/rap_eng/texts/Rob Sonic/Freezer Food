Bobby bomb drums
Rumble before they dig you up
[Added jacket spangle]
To the back of every city bus

Hazzard County Duke of Earl
With Sterling shoes and filthy tusks
The cat of Coney Island
Holy diving in the Dixie cup

Slow your roll
Precious put the basket up
The little tykes are tearing out
The heir apparent cash for [clump]

Bang the 808
Flash the fang and pass the blood
It ain't about you Pokey
Put your left foot in and pull back and up

Follows move with urgency
The perfect end to the perfect day
Scotch tape your pieces closed
Leak below, don't work that way

Daily wage, market up
Our largest cup of [bourbon straight]
Salt in the wound of a vaulted doom
And an altar where the murder is made

Bleeding Heart heart
But I cut the line I'm standing in
[Limp] foot flooring
With no mind of what a standard is

Barrel roll our carpet out
[Our largest mounted mannequin]
Go for broke and the open joke
And the hope of fucking Tanner twins

It happens his passion
Is fastened to a plastic tray
[You gonna hit the ceiling]
From the feeling of the acetate

Door gets closed, so two roll
In up on a Captain's cape
Get a [new mansion] to fuck you and him
And I know what the exact to pay

The match that's made in hell
Bellhop hat and sunken gaze
Lunch wagon bragging
About his racquetball and funnel cake

Touch of class
Touching slacks
Tugging back his stunna shade
Bobby 505, Famous Amos, Stainless Tungsten Blades

My business in this bomb start with one part iron
Two part Rocky Road with knobby nose tires
One part leaky beacon, all Paul Ryan
A half ton bomb on an all carb diet

Fires don't burn
But we sure do from me to you
A little gasoline tapestry
With a magic bean and the evening news

Easy chair
Got a week to spare
What it means to wear
What the preachers do

Ice Ice Baby like the Legionnaires' and freezer food

No I don't think I fit
And don't belong in this place
Them loonies with them uniforms
They talk differently

It's risky sitting
Pious, quiet auctioned away
When the benches brawl
And sentence walls have all been erased

A brand new day
Has been shipped in on the way down
Buck, buck, buck
Get my children off the playground

Hey now handkerchief
Bunker calling AWACS
Unfortunate under the porch again
With the Porky Pigs and stray cats

On our way, running fast
Crashed into the Krispy
Kreme/C.R.E.A.M get the money
But somebody must have missed me

Kiss me, wish me luck
Make sure my hair was tidy
When I was amiss, many judged me quick
And then changed the locks behind me

Karma at it's best
While the rest of us were speaking
[Locks are closed in the darkness ho]
And the farmer's ho is sleeping

We burgle, rang, and rung
[With slang that brung the planet]
Took one last look [to compare the book]
And then took that shit for granted

Hand it over slow like
Let me know when fun's here
No blame will be placed
No good fun without the Frontiers

Capture flag for burning
A whole platoon's cabana
Kids in charge with the KISS collage
And the pistol's Arm & Hammered

Stare into his wheat
Until he sneaked into the coatroom
Rummage through the pockets
Of the doctor's dose to Toadstool

What he saw, then he brushed them off
But he clutched his jaw and fixed it
Now he plays for keep but you can save the meek
Because I inherit this bitch

(Please)
