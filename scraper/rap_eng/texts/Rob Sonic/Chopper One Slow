[Verse]
Lunar Rover Lummox for
In accordance vapor tour
The insubordent raider more
Likely to be dumbfound
Tuned the lower notes of wreck
Like a violent monothesis sect
Stranger days your hit with sticks
Until I find the correct drumbsounds
I punched you out like a ballad fix
Cause smith does more that weather strip
Quit structure you'll never fit this square peg
Into a round hole
You tried to invade my space so I occupied
Your mind with hate it was the one time only offer
Of your shit belief inoculate
Do not touch the dead stock pitch
The only things we share are accidents
And the erratic way l juggle the metric ton
Is non ot which you should concern your self
Smoking in a gas tank and soaking in the sun
Your drink is radioactive and you actually
Think just being here is fun
Nebula rain andromeda strain like growth
And all that's been repeated echoes of the report
Leave me sorted out to be completed

[Chorus]
New speed fix gravity
Even now everything means your enemy
New speed fix gravity
Even now everything means your enemy
