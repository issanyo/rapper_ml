[Rob Sonic]
They want more feel to come out of it so
They stood there watching all the counterfeits show
Tell everybody that the pauper's here
And you can tell by the pellets they took out of his man
You're better off breaking your analysis' nose
Especially if your young and your talented don't
The checks generally got them balances though
There's them stars on the helmets like they're Dallas's, go

One way, innocence, two way radio
Gateway druggie with the run down ratio
War time crazy, go great with my look in fact
Ripped shit, bill a sale, stared when I took it back
You on some afternoon raps for the CD-
Crowd (show, you're?) syndicated, trapped on repeat
I'm on some late night, canned if I don't eat sleep
Honolu Vincent Price bad luck tiki
Bad in-flight plan, buckle-in
Truck rhyme, nozzle flow, high-code government
Auto-response, beats made of bufferin'
Wildstyle, peace of mind, wheat paste puzzlin'

[Verse 2: Creature]
Stand out, like a midget on stilts riding a unicycle
With a rifle as big as a stilt, ready to snipe you
Look, your own mens say they don't like you
They say you act like a bitch when she's on her menstrual cycle
Your parents should've advised you
It's apparent a blind man must've guided you
You ain't built to do the things that I do
Young Muddy Waters, Creats flow like he's out the Bayou
Inner City Blues, make you bleed, but I'm not Piru
Soul food for thought for seeds and sinners, too
Curt Mayfield, or Kurt Cobain
The boy heroin, need to squirt him in your veins

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
Quickly, get to the top of the roof
And head behind the car where the arsenal moved
And right beside the well, use the operative rounds
To let these motherfuckers know, there's no stopping you now
It goes- Downtown, up top, all about, audio
New York, New York, all about, audio
Downtown, up top, all about, audio
New York, New York, all about, audio

[Verse 3: Windnbreeze]
(Blitz sky?), polymorphic Hangar-eight-status
Swerve care-free, always did, no bounds out of it
Cloaked down, summoning my sumo-samurai
Larynx, catalyst, switch blade, carriage ride
Come on baby, don't cry, two-wheel spokesperson
Indo in your window, crack shadow where you flows circlin'
Boys burglin' soundscape, caught up in the scenery
Respond in a lounge- wait, caught up in a dream of me
Walkin' with a dramamine, spinnin' like I'm Seraphine
Afro-king dime, Lyme disease flow-er
One-touch, finger flooder, no quip
Got the Hangar bolt on the shoulderpad, star on the helmet tip

[Verse 3: Alaska]
Son, take a moment, catch your breath and own it
Home is for the heretics and Merrill-Lynch components
Nepotize, extra fries, five-alive, pesticides
Pride patriotic, gotta gobble up the exercise
Aerobic (class cats) phobias (abstract)
Fast-track race pace faith-based (scratch that)
Calomine or palomine, a Valentine to wash it
Downtown signs, why am I resigned to rock it?
Mechanical, arm-and-leg and beggin' for the armageddon
Army's gettin' ready for spaghetti western confrontations
Patience is a virtue that I work through as I case the joint
Anoint, take the apron, cut the strings, and I made my point
