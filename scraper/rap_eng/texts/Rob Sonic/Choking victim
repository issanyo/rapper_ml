Advice lighting track lightening stills
Breaking into hours ago draw in
Saw sin rotary grow to be raw skin
Showing off tin stars spurs and bed sheets
Turn said followers to new age chumps
Serving set needle head steeple chaser
Wash down mothers milk and other filthy Thoughts
Squat beneath the great electricity
Make pensivity 34 streets
Tour activity and murder more meat
Gel rigged and hitched configured switch
In the midst of somber arrows safe for
Men with out hats and dens with out mortars
Whys that recorder that's supposed to be on traffic
Facing you, facing you
Toward a stage of nothingness
Console console
Count bells counsel me things I won't use
Luge like used bike whose night was that
Cause I can't remember nothing but I take it
All back
Refund arranger rickshaw drive way install
Cranes but till it'	s all sideways
L.D. I see over thick rims low brow
Mighty and the choking victims
So how might we close open systems ?

Chorus

Dislodge distill
Quit job sit still
Blame it all on your head
The sharpest tool in the shed
If not this will
Still watch it fill
With rain that's falling instead
Obtain drawing of set

Misquote price soaked in precise Numeric
Order out takes bow breaks and plague
Posies migs slowly move show me two or more examples
Of commerative stampedes in honor of getting trampled
Me sitting cramped flanked by my forget its
Reminding you of how much better someone else
Said it
Finding out the only car to rent with out credit is
The madness wagon two door stretched out Lex Luther
Use your highly chosen risked
Limb for low brow mighty and the choking victim
So how might we close open systems ?

Repeat chorus
