[Intro]
Old world
Must free
Warhead
Husky
Last car
Dusty
Save us
Must be
Free ride
Rush the
Peace train
Shoot me

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Dog, curb, blurred out, just to circa 70's
Rock, roof, plaid, two enemy
Compost, fast food, centipede
Bust our fuzz, hour waiting for the late show
Gallery of greats when the place closed
Downtown polarize a grey stove
Sound stashed, over by the payphone
Guzz back, dizzy battle city where they rhyme first
Welcome to the place where the time lurks
With no deciding lines or design perks
They only recognize if your mind works
Eighty-hour weeks and you speak like a stone
Cheap stove fever by the nightstand
Seafoam fever down on my end
Repo, demon, diamond, iceland
Leading with my right hand
Leak a bath hose

[Hook]
Strange hammer in a hazard field
Cause the man with the gun got the mass appeal
Do we stand, do we run, do we ask if it's real?
Do we land on the sun if our cash is concealed?
Easel, author, son of secrets
Diesel, daughters, posturepedic
People, bosses, pawns and pieces
Bunkers, feelings, hunger, Ediths

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Free who can echo days
Mobile home, digest
Wild flex, superhuman bicep
Sigh nest, who can prove an Ibex?
Ricochet, Richard Bay, fix a fate of violence
And who can rip the place like a chinet?
And move a picture frame that defines fresh?
And tell it to the rain while it's eye's wet?
Drive less, frizzy, dry, product placement
The blinds drive, echo winter solstice
The iPod break a head in post script
The eyes I faded in hypnosis
Twice a week just to speak, crazy, cannot focus

[Bridge]
Easel, author, son of secrets
Diesel, daughters, posturepedic
People, bosses, pawns and pieces
Bunkers, feelings, hunger, Ediths

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]
Waste, excess, style a concentrated way to look
Wormhole on hiatus beta-hook
Sony, son of Sega mega crook
Hook it like Samsung, serving up my can-can
Flim-flim, power to the xenophobe
10-10, hour for the screen a pro
Engine, flower for the scenic roads
To the bank, thank the monks while I'm here, audio
Video Vanguard, village gate
Studio, landshark, Philip Tate
Radio, ramparts, illustrates
Rocket man, Aquaman, prototype, collagen
Sinners, Jean Killer, green clock
Then isn't he differently mocked?
Three-way, evade, histamine block
The phantom blade can't enrage
Hammer, strange, stop?

[Hook]
Strange hammer in a hazard field
Cause the man with the gun got the mass appeal
Do we stand, do we run, do we ask if it's real?
Do we land on the sun if our cash is concealed?
Easel, author, son of secrets
Diesel, daughters, posturepedic
People, bosses, pawns and pieces
Bunkers, feelings, hunger, Edith's

[Outro]
Poetic Queens
The Bronx
Manhattan
Brooklyn
Staten Island
It's on the train
We out of space
We out of space
