(Automatic collections, phased out, unsafe)

[Verse 1]
Bitches call me Ward the way I punish the Beaver
Brake your Firebird or else I'm coming to key you

Burnt side of chopper with his mug on the heater
Like do not apprehend if you're not one of his keepers

Shoveled your sheep herd, shepherd's your ferry
The jostle in and out of all available bearings

Bottle in his mouth he got a Coppola airy
Pulled overtook a leak., got Cannoli to carry

Pick in his axe hand, he passes the pair/pear
A little in the mutton and the rest in the day

Two fang, loose Frank Drebin you hater
A blue flame,[two jank], Jefferton's mayor
(Automatic)

Peppermint prayer, The Apple asleep
With a half-lit Camel at the back of his feet

Casually gashing your magnary teeth
Bringing dogs to the chapel, if the Gapple is green

Jackal and Gene, news at the diner
A back to the wall and a Tuna fish slider

He had to remind you with a couple of shiners
That he hanker for a hunk of what you ain't got inside you

(Like that)

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died
The rabbit with the watch and the mole with a bow tie
They want us to reload with the soldier with no eyes

I went and asked Alice and she gave me peace
Some blotter, some poppers, and the famous tea
Some uppers, some downers and she basically
Said you oughta know that Thunderdome is basement weed

[Verse 2]
Paint the pariah, and pickle a patsy
Kraft get it in like the middle of mac cheese

Whittled a Raft fleet out of pixels and cap teak
When he could've would've should've just whistled for taxi

Gnarly gas HEAP, Happy? Enjoy
Sill times, leather time, Chatterley loin

Rabbit feet noise can get the cavalry point
To the posse out on Broadway, but it's after we joined

Watership Down, they double the count
Def Jam Jeeps leaving Rustlers round

Trouble in town there's no mistaking the sound
Of the shit hitting the fan from the janitor's lounge

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died
The rabbit with the watch and the mole with a bow tie
They want us to reload with the soldier with no eyes

I went and asked Alice and she gave me peace
Some blotter, some poppers, and the famous tea
Some uppers, some downers and she basically
Said you oughta know that Thunderdome is basement weed

[Verse 3]
It's like amateur hour, a pet in a poke
Lobby for the reverend and the veteran pope

Chest full of smokes and the Pebble Flintstone
That is prepped to pull your card and put your deck in the spoke

Iller than Flo and stricter than Mel
So Dingy better pick up all epiphany felt

While Billy Bean breaking off the chickeny smell
Like he tried to sell crack to the Liberty Bell

[Hook]
The king on the card gave the crowd wine
The straws were all down 'til most of the hope died
The rabbit with the watch and the mole with a bow tie
They want us to reload with the soldier with no eyes

I went and asked Alice and she gave me peace
Some blotter, some poppers, and the famous tea
Some uppers, some downers and she basically
Said you oughta know that Thunderdome is basement weed
