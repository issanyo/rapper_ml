[Chorus]
Impaired diluted oxygen contacts
Collective weigh station is your brain syntax
Subtle interference incoherent in fact
The sedated measure, waits forever

[Verse 1]
In addition to the suction sweeps and undertow
With a maniacs grimace, with a premise that permits the value
Humans loosing tactic through the aerobatic dynamic slanted premonition
Of the first third world, a warming awe
Succulent saint bide his dance with one chance to be absorbed
Absence of the manic slash now an eternal spring
Hoping the copper tones and silver glass return my inner sense
I can reflect the widow's peak from the window's pain select
Redirect the light beam from what remains and a correction for my Windex
Sight tomorrow we'll all be singing but tonight we just complain
Slipping into a refrain as if it were explained
That I'd be stranglin' with my lifeline
And I embracelet that's irrelevant so my objection stays sustained

[Chorus]
Impaired diluted oxygen contacts
Collective weigh station is your brain syntax

[Verse 2]
My addiction is to hell in a daggered cell from my descent
Indecent exposure swaggered cross the galaxy from my biopsy
Paranormal abdomen strain and the throat approaches thought
Two glocken (gloaken?) steak knife dramatic pause
Breach contract clause and the masquerade applause
Passive arrogance countering my plastic grave concern
Ignite spite, second spit, and split with an urge to quit
Cinch is unbearable, an overturned variable, futuristic vegetable
Place mat minds face that time with caution
Velocity uncontrolled, precious eyes from nauseous to ferocious
Let me under dose on my unhappiness long enough for me to find sure footing
Before rebooting, returning, and retrospective

[Chorus]
Impaired diluted oxygen contacts
Collective weigh station is your brain syntax
Subtle interference incoherent in fact
The sedated measure, waits forever

[Verse 3]
Shoebox commodore Pentium pendulums laced
Strip circuit searching the bio-waste while sniffing paste
Ludent passage handled gravity eyes and the basiled magentacide
Drip love and easy go letting my Hansel track (tract?) and nasal cavity relieve
Not like I believe, but it breed without the aid of life support
And the charade of the night court, if who I veer rat fork(right for?)
In passing I can see the masking tape, harassing me a sight
Stained like Beethoven's fifth to which I do sedate
With my listen crate overhaul the world to make it appear metallic
Pallet empty sense and my soul release
