[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
I barely, walk with the living
Cough, hiss, and glisten
Mosh pit across drawbridges in all positions
Off kilter, pissin' colors you could augment your suspicions with
Penciled in his office hours: mini-bar to pillow mint
Minotaur, stacking apple boxes up to badger from
Crack or midi daggers through the Mack Truck of Mackie hum
Back and brought a Patty Hearst
As Arkanoid machines are being actively re-championed across the laundromat-iverse
(Assassinate 'em) Actually, that's not how his powers work
When every bit of fledgling gift is cherry picked and counter cursed
Voted most likely to be snowed-in at a desolate hotel writing a novel
Shining up his finest gospel
Dorf on rap, got the wrong transistor to cut
Caught in a cage like a stitch in a lung
I surface later, dirty version of Da Vinci undone
Beneath a little pinch of what these London Bridges become, run!

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Any time, any place; ready made easy
Bad moon born at the corner of breaks, bleeding
Feeding off the fumes of the human remains, freaky
Stay shoot stay proof stay doomsday, sleepy
Mallon got hustle, hustle they got
Enough to cause trouble for a couple of blocks
No matter what the draw whether balling or not
All the Stunts call them nothing but they call them a lot

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Over coat open so you can see stolen gold
Necklaces olive green fava beans rolling stones
Row a boat, rock it not pocket watch broken home
Wallet out polish proud prophecies totem pole
Ten to one in here musketeers kitchen knife
Reservoir doggyearâ€™d, get the car, tip him twice (tip him twice)
Thank you much, tankards up kiss the wife
Let bygones be bygones and let time bombs set to minute rice
Best buy worst wear Tommy knocking hockey puck
Iced out spilled milk chilling kill the body does
Daisy chain electric chair seven pair of Johnny pumps
Aiming at your firewire timing my Malachi crunch
Pick a penny, flip it off Gowanus bridge
Wax and wane, half insane; this explains your politics
Wagon train roll them out chariots of smog inhaled
When two to tango turns to six carrying your coffin rails

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
I got the ready aim, headache of a suicide face-card
Heartache of the same, and raise roofs made of radar
Ate food pay Tuesday, I'm goose eggs Monday
Crusade fuel gauge gutsy, loose change, Rust-o
Sippy cup of Kool-aid on the little bus
Dashboard hula girl and crash course in kicking dust
Here is where the warships nip and tuck, gorgeous
And roast marshmallows on forceps over corpses

[Verse 4: Rob Sonic]
I got the sort of skill to board your lil zeppelin filled with heroin
Warn the fort, horses sport aces over pair of kings
Threat level elevate celebrate the terrorists
Pistol whip the princess visit neon Leon Theremin
Air is thin might need a tank or canon, copy?
To make it up the mountain top, set up shop and plant the poppy
Seed spread sowed, open for patch of water
Now lets hear it for the boys who put the laughter back in slaughter

[Hook]
