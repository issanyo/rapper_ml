In one place
Goin' out to...
Ahhh yea, my man...

(Verse 1)
Quintessent, need a mortgage, main transplant
Went in his way high off the fumes
Scrapin' your hands while stand by try and consume
Media, ready mart, marketing, youth
Stuck in the track vital seismic primal
Urge to, nerves blue, under the mass
Fist, full of medicaid, zest, pull the decorate
Settlin' rocks through the window metal and stock
For the heroes crying for you
Slush, your a stone gas, first, in your clone class
Pull out my knife, carving I was not here
During an air raid so its under the desk

(Chorus)
I got five on the future
When it's safe, then its safe
When it's safe, then its safe now

(Verse 2)
Automated, hearing cones, satellites and drains
Name four things that you paid for
Without knowing it during the Bush campaign
Barges for ink, mink oil for slick
Waterford rings, for the last course, jock it(?)
It sings when he's half horse probably sick
Most of new ways, helium promo tapes
As good a time for a sample of my O plus
It's bustin' just inflate
When ya wait, for the shed skin
Ya wait, in the dead wind
Remember the code, before the money took hold
Then ya run and shook show, breaking bread with fate

(Chorus)
I got five on the future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then it's safe now

Cause that's my former future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then it's safe now

I got five on the future
When it's safe, then it's safe
When it's safe, then its safe now
