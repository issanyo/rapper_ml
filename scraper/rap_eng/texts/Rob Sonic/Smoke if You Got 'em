(Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 1)
I'm like, Dave the dope fiend's shooting his smack
And the tail spin's loosin' G's with goose in the back
Mayday "Mayday beacon, we can loosen the straps" we can loosen the straps
And then ready, aim, eject us once the roof is detached

The rooster is trapped and the prices are swayed
The war effort fails when devices are made
There's blights in our lines and a heist in our safes
And the cats will go crazy when mice are away

[Aesop Rock]
Hey, thirty feet the fat lace, 10 for the rafters
Cut the other 20 in the 4 or 5 after
'Til each one on checkerboard J & J classics
Pose when he go to kick his apple box backwards

Daddy hack and brought a pack of bready thumb suckers
But the pigs grew immune to the tune of the fuzz busters
Blink, beat, cut a wink of sleep out of forty
You will gloriously rinse and repeat every morning

(Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 2)
[Rob Sonic]
Wait, the people of dirt merger and theme stores
By design we're tough, there's no whining in those dreams force
If you can pick the winners and fix your mind for team sports
And if you can't then so it goes, it's only Joe's marine corps

Hoping those machines for, quarter thugs and free plays
Whippit rust, pitch adjust the mortar drugs and keepsakes
Keep your teeth and shed your skin, invest your mint in cheapskates
Roll around, Payola down on Benjamin your DJ

Get your pin and A-T-M and bend the tax law
Max your credit limit out and bet it all on hack saws
Build a cabin out of tree, front and center back logs
Rope 'em all together with the with the talking head and slackjaw

Rabbit's feet and cat's claw, knocking wood for luck like:
Teach your feet, pull double deck or stumble through the sun light
Get a closer look at what you were before the bug bites
Hand defense and get a smoke cuz you can't even fuck right

(Chorus)
If there's hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Hope in your medicine
Treats

Then you know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Know you won't get it in
Free

(Verse 3)
[Aesop Rock]
Lambs and lions, lions and lambs
You can't imagine the recital my tiny violins planned
I'll be the opus like a needle through the eyelids of man
And prop the bodies on the beaches of leviathan land

Fire and brimstone, fighter no, tiger by the toe
Kick and bicker while the evil images flicker and grow
Predatory ghouls that rule the roost swimmingly
Attach 'em to the business end of uneven chemistry

Black market shops, the cops that stole the serotonin
Shove down the throat of the moment he broke his focus
Now the whole damn city is rickety to the rivets
Still he fist up like the pillory in his prison

What a long day, what a dark night, what a cruel morn
What a demo if tomorrow's New York
And this is fresh out the dimensions of your record collection
Between the AC and Acadely sections, any questions?

[Rob Sonic]
Nobody breathes and we're all gonna leave here
But if they ain't gonna speak then we're all gonna sleep here
We're treats for the wolves like, hey there's no beef here
Now smoke if you got 'em and we'll rock when the streets clear
(x2)

I said we'll rock when the streets clear
You know we'll rock when the street clear
You know we'll rock when the street clear

These two can really be a problem (scratches)
