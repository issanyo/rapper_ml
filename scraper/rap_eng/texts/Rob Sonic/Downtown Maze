[Chorus: Sonic Sum]
(Downtown Maze) (Dowtown Maze) (Downtown Maze)
I am Sharpen but so dull, I am just another link, missing points we're all so fond of, as my teeth fall in the sink.im so sharp
(Downtown Maze)
yet so dull, and am just another link, missing points we're all so fond of, as my teeth fall in the sink. I am sharp but yet so dull, I am just another link.

[Verse 1: Sonic Sum]
High pressure situation aggravated hypertence  sends the forth k costa of the roady rocky mountains. hike through the disbelief & the signs of logical grief. playing absolutely into the hands of fate. the flood gates of wyder park, what it takes to charter not made anyone better for where, dark and stare waits hoping that the shandeleer, shadows dance with mine or last time before we shave and become a permanent fixture. and I become the bottemize to use my feelings of the oil seal. tramatized by pepatear purged on pillars gamma rays rebound by the violet ultra. Blind holding my tin cup on the corner between broadway and ursev. the moblie curse direction hear not any further. erge my coaxing ways of enging into dusty cabienets, under pile.

[Chorus: Sonic Sum]
(Downtown Maze) (Dowtown Maze) (Downtown Maze)
I am Sharpen but so dull, as my teeth fall in the sink, missing points we're all so fond of, and I am just another link. im am sharpen
(Downtown Maze)
but so dull, as my teeth fall in the sink, missing points we're all so fond of, cause im just another link.

[Verse 2: Sonic Sum]
I still brush the vertabrail thinking sensitive poitive charge electro shock thearpy, my canapy settles nicely into the jet stream. gently easing me down in Cambodia. but this old place reminds me of new york minus all the ricky shroulders, clean my cashet. im going cash as I past u in the street. once I was class and now yo shit ina where I sleep n where I eat. at least thank me for having you in a glance of acknolegment cause the smile on me made the difference between the morning and the swift currant. pardon my expression but my hostility has no matters. I am the fosphourus porcupine . touch me and you won't regret how ill feel. exchange my life styles as this one is a mental blast from real, and I have never been so hot, cause it only took a second, for it to hurry, so messy but it wasent.

[Chorus: Sonic Sum]
I am Sharpen but so dope, I am just another link, its the joint thats rolled so fine dawg, as my teeth fall in the sink.i am sharpen
(Downtown Maze)
but so dope, I am just another link, its the joint thats rolled so fine though, as my teeth fall in the sink. am sharpen.

Sorry for spelling errors deffinatley are sum =P couldn't find any lyrics on the internet so this is all from heart. Probably as close as you can get. I went over sentences in the song many time before writing it and reviewing as well but I have no doubt in my mind there are sum errors. Anyway's someone had to do it, its the my favorite production in hip hop history, its a work of art and that's what I look for in songs. Is that feeling that a song like this gives you that makes you think, "Why don't we know this?" but theres more. Stop trying to fit in, and look for whats real.
