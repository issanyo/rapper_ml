[Intro]
You face that, ball
You face that, oh
You face that, wall
You break that, law

You face that, you break that, you take that

[Hook]
Wall
Face that wall
Embrace that role
Taste for endangered and break that law
Face that wall
Embrace that role
Taste for endangered and break that law

[Verse 1]
See, they wanna know who got the hubcap nuke
Package your number-one acid proof
Action soup
The man the means that waits inside of my machine
Revised version of the stock movement
Animation breaking through the posthumous
Costume fit
Still reserve an aisle seat on silver birds
NFO talk about the super grade
Open letter carrying approval rate
Rules that make you fool yourself
Could lose an eye and not get help
Shoulda brain muscle know the same old reasons magic contained in the game show re-run
We have come to a halt
Beautiful paper-cut super ball soul

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Overtime with the tune delay
System semi-automotive mute decay
News relayed to you a perk for not bringing your guns to work
Laser driven muscles so the goods transfer
And shuttle back and forth to the new cancer
Answer the question why and sweep your leg for cobra kai
Waiting on the welder for the electric
Baby Jesus figure and a free breakfast
Test kits and vegetables are handed out at festivals
Rise and pass a message on the PDA
Just to get a replicated TV tray
Three weeks late now sign the check to sonic psycho minor threat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Even rocking a hand made sign
The uncertain and a Virgin Airway line
And say I'm the Solomon lampshade off the halogen
Been inside the silo where columns grew up from the imaginary solitude
Follow through at least your fit to get tried on some treason shit
Exaggerated levels in the mixture taste
More plastic in the Rivers than to fix Jones' face
Acetate attack device the goods the bads and my sacrifice

[Hook]
