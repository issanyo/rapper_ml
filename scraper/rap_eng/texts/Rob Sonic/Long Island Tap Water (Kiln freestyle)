You know it's crazy, you had Double Negative, you had Diabolic, you had Aesop Rock, you had RA the Rugged Man all grow up within like 20 miles of each other. Can't deny this shit man. Long Island is a crazy fucking place to live. Bunch of fucking maniacs. Must've been something in that Long Island tap water

As a kid I was a little punk, loud mouth little runt
Literally living off of Swisher blunts and other pick-me-ups
Collecting with the rest of the litter by the river front
Reviewing riveting revelations meant to riddle us
And since then, been an uphill battle like Sisyphus
I won't sissy fuss, I put in work for every minute punched
Almost went to prison once from a swinging fist that he didn't duck
Which led to hospital beds and missing fronts
I never listened much, shit I still don't
But I know the deal that's why I only build with real folks
My life story is a tree branch through my wheel spokes
I base it loosely on some 80's movies that I still quote
Long Island railroad, heading east third to last stop
Mishaps and have-nots, and bolt cutters for the pad locks
Let's get wild as fuck til we're getting chased by mad cops
I'm like sure sign me up, where do I put my Hancock
A 40 and a blunt was our mascot
On some John Bobbitt shit we were running around half cocked
I was a great man, ?? with a sandlot
I'm killing um Smalls, playing baseball with your mailbox
Never hit a Riverhead jail cop but I'm not frail
Cops tail in high trail but thank God I got bail
I will not fail
I'm Long Island like North Shore soccer moms with their Xanax and vodka cocktails
Before I got the mic or ever learned to rock it right
I was a young g, trust me the Dundee of pocket knifes
One false move y'all fools got a slice
See I follow Christ, but more closely resemble the Sodomites
I'm not alright, it comes down like an avalanche
I could depress when I think of regrets and shattered plans
Like back in school I had a crush on Carolyn
But lacked the balls to talk to her even when I saw her without her man
So I'd lose myself in a local arcade
But couldn't shake the scars made on my heart with that harsh blade
Forced to endure such a sharp pain
Walking a road that's part paved, but the other part was a dark cave
I was bitter as shit cuz I told myself the worst lies
Like I could ?? River this bitch and turn tides
Standing there with hurt pride on a rusty Huffy
Trying to bunny hop the curb side but failing on the first try
It was more than endorphines that brought him to this place
Born in some grip tape cuz it was boredom to escape
But it's important to risk take cuz all of the mistakes
Prepared him for a long life of falling on his face
Fancy this I roam/Rome the empire like Cassius
With a band of transients redefining what a family is
Everlasting happiness, spliff passing, acid hits
Planning my journey didn't land me on a gurney or an ambulance
Running 'round the scene like we little green Martians
Hope they take Monopoly money and vouchers for free parking
Weed sparking, security dogs keep barking
Three cartons up my sleeve as I flee from the flea market
To get a 40 that's where my brethren heading shortly
Cypher bound, to leave a bed of severed heads before me
On the better edge of glory, but they'll still portray you
Cuz there's a foul call to this never ending story
Where daddy's money makes these faggots popular
While I was in a sump with a blunt and a pair of binoculars
It's how we got the drop on ya
Now you got your ???? shot up by the start of Jacket Mafia
Running up in these street walls barely armed
My brethren never needed weapons to do you fairies harm
I was either home jerking working on these hairy palms
Or freestyling with Lou and Andre behind your local dairy barn
Making mice of men who try to contend with my temper
Rhyme expert slash habitual line stepper
Sick part we took hallucinogenic mind benders
Right before we explored the Kings Park Psych Center
Before kids had to wear them silly biker helmets
And social media left the entirety of their life embellished
I have felt it, don't know if I should tell it
Popping handfuls of psychedelics until my fucking eyelids melting
All I have to say don't ask me why I laugh this way
Bag of haze at The Bluff to catch the last of the sun's passing rays
Suffolk's finest with his badge displayed
Tryna throw cuffs around me for how I spend my Suffolk County Saturdays
For some reason I seem to get lost inside the past
That wants his ass, getting high on my private stash
Never did my homework but I murdered a final draft
Then go and light a duby off the Bunsen burner in science class
I was a mastermind, I thought I told y'all
Skipped class to get ass and make it back in time for roll call
?? the mark of fame, tag my name in an old store
Neighborhood survivor shot hiding rocks in a snowball
We would party 'round the clock, don't know how to stop
Cuz they came back with an 18 pack and an ounce of pot
Product of a wild youth, you should child proof them powerlocks
Eggs, shaving cream and batteries in a flour sock
First base was okay, third base was Disney Land
Wondering how much titty he could fit in his little hand
On the way to the city as we divvy through these shitty plans
12 dudes one blunt inside of Thompson's minivan
Never a follower, I ran in front of the dumb flock
And whatnot at the bus stop, bunch of pot in my lunchbox
Wasn't from the hood, first time I heard a gunshot
Is when Jay put one to his head, squeezing then the fun stopped
Blood everywhere let that shit stain the wall
Of the Smith Haven Mall that's where the kids came to brawl
Then Robbie ratted on Pras and that shit changed us all
Should of known he was bitch made before that bitch made the call
But fuck it, used to puff dutches and punch suckas
Then run up in cum dumpsters, thank God for that one rubber
Some fun loving young fuckers
But forced laws, boys had our life on strain by these corporate blood suckers
Life pulled a switcharoo it's giving him the blues
Like the ingredient that indicates the kid is pissing in the pool
I took part in the wild shit that kids will do
That's why I get nostalgic every time I pass our middle school
I ran with a pack of crackers mad as hatters
Turning every random factor into a laughing matter
That genuinely exuberant brand of laughter
But when I try to recapture the source it feels forced and manufactured
I need food for the soul, I know the recipe
Dumb high taking a blunt ride with Nicole and Stephanie
Behold the reverie
It's like this whole song is like my inner child playing ring and run with the present me
It presented me with a bunch of pride that I ain't swallow
And asked why as an adult I can't follow the same model
Nevermind it leaves my brain boggled
Tryna recapture lightning for the second time in the same bottle
But I forever rep the home front
Treating you geeks like loose leaf, you can get a hoe punched
I shouldn't of been left alone much
There was something in that water that made my brethren go nuts
I never been a stepping stone once
I'm still at the flagpole that assholes yet to show up
Catch me repping the 90's like a set of gold fronts
My inner Toys "R" Us kid singing I'll never grow up
