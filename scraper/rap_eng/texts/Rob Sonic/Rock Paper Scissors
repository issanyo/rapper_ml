I pull up to the spot with the knock off Bapes
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
Yeah I'm bumping Lou Rawls and a New Kids tape
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still puffing in the store with your chick all day
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still claiming I'm the source when that broad ball breaks
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes

Pistol mouth Pete, hot as a dog's teat
[Set off on the left, led him sevens and call free]
Effort with an “E” and beleaguered and drawn to
Them sherpas I could learn them to burn up the ballroom

Log flume barking and back in your court mad
Like where'd you get that start or a heart to record that
Harvest the porn mags, and use it to lose face
A hundred in his wallet and one in his suitcase

[Roof raid missing the porkage of bread ruin]
Riffing when they shouldn't and horny as hell's coos
Order [me yelp] soup like I'm high as Christmas
But then I take it back like a fly was in it

Driver hit it, here's a couple of karats/carrots
Because when Smits making dollars he don't want it to perish
Up in the air, is it a bird, a brick
No I heard he just been rolling like he Eartha Kitt

Worth a lick but just feeling a good grief
I know how many O's are in the middle of Tootsie
Could be crazy and I could be on
To something when I said you shouldn't push me wrong

Hoof feet fond in the face of danger
Yogi with a trophy mount made for ranger
See if six was a nine it wouldn't be a six
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

I pull up to the spot with the knock off Bapes
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
Yeah I'm bumping Lou Rawls and a New Kids tape
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still puffing in the store with your chick all day
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still claiming I'm the source when that broad ball breaks
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes

Zipper neck fleece, brain of a sawhorse
Flesh reanimated, remains of a small war
Painted the drawn sword to match with the straw hat
All leather, rubber, and covered in gauze pads

Cupboards of cloth rags and bottles of Pomade
Zippo in the monogram motto that mom made
Shop 'Til You Drop weight then guess within five pounds
To win a promo photo with Bozo the Clown's mouth

Opening downtown, near Joe's on the west side
A [so perverted] junkie with nowhere to get high
Oceans of neck ties meets the River Phoenix
Before he got killed breaking up some beef shit

Stuff the sheets with green for funding
A little league team full of thieves for cufflinks
Keep on shoving and it won't be long
Till you find out why I said you shouldn't push me wrong

Cook meatballs with the bread defloured
Sweating like a rent-a-cop at Eddie Bauer
See to get the magic number divide nine by three
What's a nice girl like you doing with a guy like me?

I pull up to the spot with the knock off Bapes
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
Yeah I'm bumping Lou Rawls and a New Kids tape
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still puffing in the store with your chick all day
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
I'm still claiming I'm the source when that broad ball breaks
Rock beats scissor rock, scissor beats papes
