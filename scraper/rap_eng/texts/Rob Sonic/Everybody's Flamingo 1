How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich

Verse 4 - Will Smith - The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

Verse 5 - Gorillaz - Feel Good, Inc
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, ’cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Verse 6 - Nate Dogg - You Reposted in the Wrong Neighborhood (Mashup between the lyrics of "Shake That" by EMINEM and the instrumental from "Casin" by glue70)
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy

Verse 7 - 50 Cent - In Da' Club
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

Verse 8 - Aesop Rock - Hail Mary Mallon
Money on my motherfucking mind
Cop five haircuts at the same time
White gold pants, Jet Ski made of Yuan
Foie gras bust of Albert Einstein
Get Money

Verse 9 - Rob Sonic (Same song)
Money out my motherfucking mouth
A mansion, a ranch, and a camp and a town
A motherfucking store with a floor made of scalps
Bobby from the block don't got rocks, he got Alps
Get Money

Verse 10 Pink Guy (A.K.A. Filthy Frank) - Ramen King
Yo, I still masturbate while eating top ramen
At a faster rate in the bigger quantities
It counts as rape when I'm slurping at this unbelievable pace
I turn the temperature up all the way to sweat up on my face
If you give no effort, if you got no money
Then I got a cheap method
Crack it open throw it in a pan and let it cook bitch
Now that's a real education fuck books
