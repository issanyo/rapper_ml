[Bridge 1: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Hotel, motel, holy ghost
Razor blade, jailbait, over dose
Woke up pristine no one knows
What you did last winter in the Poconos

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Ayo, he got the glass eye squint
Fab five time out and the hide out kids
Honey comb collective and the tae-bo kick
Little Billy posted by the blinds loaded
No shit, the swivel of the bar stool baddy
Pimp lane signal the single car pool caddy
Water witching the grinch in his large flat feet
Stitching his initials in skins and begin laughing
Bring back his body keep frosty
The eyes in the hill won't be still till they see raw meat
Hung from a hook in a nook of the barns loft beams
Auctioned and sold to the farmer in Charles charging
Antenna fender remember the raw dealings
Hard wired fired the liars abroad stealing
Spinning wheels for the meal of the dog heeling
Your hands under my feet and OGâ€™ing the caught feelings
Dressed in his sloppy suit
You can hear him screaming from the inside of the locker room
Just another day in paradise pastrami chew
That leaves you face caved Aes make um Wally moose

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Come on you can trust me
There's room on the floor and more in the front seat
The stuff in the trunk is just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven and yes, death becomes me
Hail the king, hail a cab, hail satan
Hail Zoul and the full that I'm paid in
Hail the queen, hail a chief, hail caesar
Hail mary and carry in the believers

[Bridge 2: Rob Sonic]
Rescue gunner 5 by the frozen rope
Test tube butterfly swollen throat
Death cruise trucker bribe know one knows
What you did last summer in the Poconos

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
The rope-a-dope defense, close with it's own PS
"kick rocks", city a necropolis for clipped locks
Tire piles, broken bones, cloven toe, piss-pot
Troma quotes exploding onto rotoscoped film stock
Firecane, half comotose, all killshot
Cough up, terrifying tales from the chaw cup
Twinkle twinkle little sinkhole, drinking decorative flamingos
Stippling a plastic lawn, picket fences, cats and dogs
Mallon juke left in bumper-to-bumper hazards on
Balance off, blackout, back for the Munsters marathon
Gather bad medicine, duffel bag, canteen, etch a sketch
Hula popper, cash, plaid pendleton
Smash and grab everything tetris'd in the sprinter
With the i'd rather be cutting the head off a serpent sticker
Perfect, dead youth flowin old habits
The getaway bus ride only so magic
Fact, he mostly know the company of roustabouts
Icky rathskellars where they sell lunch with the power out
Our gang, wallop on some honestly it's now or now
Donkey in his crosshairs, Bobby taking Bowser down

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Come on you can trust me
There's room on the floor and more in the front seat
The stuff in the trunk is just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven and yes, death becomes me
Hail the king, hail a cab, hail satan
Hail Zoul and the full that I'm paid in
Hail the queen, hail a chief, hail caesar
Hail mary and carry in the believers
