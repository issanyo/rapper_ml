Interrupter interceptor on the fritz
Ritz of passage military binge on plasma
Hypnotic so we've lost it
Sober by redefining laments terms as black out and no generator
Autopsy turvy cadence raising rent on utility closets
Collective degenerates defaming Idea men's deposits
Having a go at razor wire double Dutch And Frisbee
Toss with saw blades
Where all stayed for the health watch but came
For the cotton candy
On the sandy Rotten normalcy's we've informally gotten handy
At handling loss and straddling fences
With the accuracy of blind pilots trying desperately to thread the needles eyelet in a dark room
I can sense the climate here would be better
Suited for vegetation If it weren't for the radiation

Moons perpetual insured against collision
Calcium with Draw on either side of life
Knife edge collecting group support
In short of finding out the directions
From your insides To the equator
Thick with desolation brain stationary craters
And ladders that lead to no where
Staring Into space they've Erased our imagery
To limit the curiosity
Put a two drink Minimum on time lock
So l'm rocked before I get there
And when does not exist its all just yen and lira
Sharpel tunnel syndrome causing our flows to veer
Across the double yellow rinse and run the risk of someone
Appreciating your patronage
To the last chapter of today's Mechanics
After a standard bout with pneumonia the minutes
Seem to straighten out
