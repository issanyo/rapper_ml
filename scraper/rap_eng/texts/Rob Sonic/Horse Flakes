[Sample]
Well, some of the kids are giving us trouble, like - like Dale Britz and Petey Jerrick.  I hate them worst. We'll kill them first

[Aesop Rock]
Add up all the charts and exams
If it ain't what you are, make a heart with your hands
I know, you skirted catechism
Snuck into the movie theater
Heard that a train had hit person and left school to see it
Us too

[Rob Sonic]
Crush groove luscious from the wine rice
Kawasaki Fonzie from the [?] to the limelight
Das Boot for a ticket taking Blimpies to a goth chick
He met when he got water and quarters at Billy's Topless

[Aesop Rock]
Back with a cyborg eye, four wives
Nine toes and the pieces of the tri-force high
Weird science settling away
Cleared by us on a diet of his pride and a Papaya King a day, ay

[Rob Sonic]
Be all you can and fore you stand to lose the source
Number all your blessings and your X-wings that can use the force
Ball til you fall and I will give what I got
But all I got's a stupid mime and an invisible box

[Aesop Rock]
A.R. playing dumb, looking pretty dumb
Feel dumb, act petty, snacks at the ready
We operate the claws and offer up heaven to Betsy
Like the blood is flowing out his arms into the decks directly

[Rob Sonic]
Vampire, skin like a blanched primer
At Penn station placing his socks on a hand dryer
Campfire, tell him tales with a funny look
Pulling out a snack with a traffic map and a bloody hook

[Sample]
I hope you're saving your father and me for last
But you're dangerous
What?

[Aesop Rock]
Roll dice (what?), dole out rice
Hose down outside, comb out lice
Might hunt, gather, master the winter
And put himself out to pasture, by dinner

[Rob Sonic]
Bag lunch, Cap'n Crunch, antifreeze
80 stories up now all the uncles look like ants to me
Steel girder moonwalk, tell you I'm not paid enough
A fly motherfucker like Helen Hunt doing angel dust

[Aesop Rock]
Now if the weed in your town was an Ewok brown
But there really wasn't ever any other shit around
Get comfy, get that money, get unseen
Walk in the door, fava beans get jumpy

[Rob Sonic]
Now if the shrooms in your rooms turn your walls to mountains
And your dog starts telling you to walk without him
And he tries to fix your teeth with some pliers and duck tape
You better watch your back and keep your eye on them cupcakes

[Aesop Rock]
I sometimes wonder if the future me finds food
Find future me wishing younger me would hide food
High noon, pacing in a tragic pageant
Take ten, turn around and get them raptors active

[Rob Sonic]
Now all I really want is some love and my rent paid
Before I used to go buck and get cuffed at the Jet's game
And now I never see what I believe 'til my bed's made
Cuz before I almost died over a fucking cassette tape
