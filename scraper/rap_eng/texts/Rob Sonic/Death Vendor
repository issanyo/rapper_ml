[Intro]
Oh, wow
This is alright

[Rob Sonic]
Yeah, these beats
Yeah...
Sonic, everybody, throw up Sonic, hah
Cop music

[Verse - Rob Sonic]
Get into your life
Use radar-device, fool
Parameters ISO in and the janitors hide too
Illaminate ID, amateur IV, salmon
Chemical, now answer the wild weave
Got a capital cabana corrosive
Through the watch-pot boil and the planet explodes
Rock-stop royal down the hand of a hostess
Quick-slide photo-finish fantasy coach
Now don't take advantage of
The planes to the buildings that are standing up
In a rain-soaked, salivating panic, flushed
I hold still like you waiting for your hands to rust
I'll let you know when I'm in touch
With reality, but right now there's an obstacle
My sanity's a patron on a dollar bus
So formality that might make that impossible
On point like a Vulkan's ear
With the worst dynamics of The Waltons, yeah
A bird's eye's vantage of the vulcaneers
See, if it's only for the money
Then we're off to cheers
Cut fat with my orchid shears
In the faux fabric of the space control
Sub-access 'til the coast is clear
In the post-stop co-(?)-ting grove

[Chorus]
Mayday, mayday
Close to the corridor
You can get in, get out
You got tickets, tickets
Through the exit, exit
Go Singapore, hypothetic, thetic
People music, music

[Verse - Rob Sonic]
Adrenaline gum drop
Marauders with lunch box
The all-wheel drive for the benefit, cum-cocked
A sedative savant, etiquette sub-pop
The mechanism, teeth
Preventative, front-botched
Throw the fight, now's the child's in charge
Of the asylym and the mild retards
Anarchist stylin' to the dinosaurs
Analysts slicin's 'bout survival scars

Suffering, imagining
Shots to recover him from Saturday
Gun violence to kill a magistrate
You get your funds while your ticket in the cabaret

Take a message to your orbiter
That my float-grease'll get into your foreman grill
Like a slow runner reaching for performance pill
And make you see what I'm saying, like a foreign film

[Chorus]

[Verse - Rob Sonic]
Heir to condition of "release the hounds"
On a bull-run paralell of these accounts
Souveneir-shop mugging for the bleacher crowd
Boost a via stop bugging the police a hound
In full force like a borrowed five
For milk-jar jade to keep my art alive
In a way to tone of to your art supply
Innovative more parts that are marginized
Seargent balls will (?) your hold
Wicks this are similar to Kosovo
Tips from a simulated roller-coaster
See bits of an illustration overdose

[Chorus]
