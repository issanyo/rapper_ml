[Hook x2]
Be alarmed
We’re in charge
We have starved
For too long

Animal
Vegetable
Criminal
Ride for every time
I tried to drive
It til the
Rims were loose

Blinded by the wild
Side and miles
By the kitchen spoon

Inspired by the
Kind of guys
That plier pry
Your wisdom tooth

Business move

Breyers lines the siding of his
Army coat
Talking to this cradle
Rocking Robin in safari mode
She said life is like a box of
Java scripts and Harley spokes
Feeding demon dragons
Speeding wagons so we R.E.O.’d

Carlito

Sorry doesn’t cut it plus he
Doesn’t pack a rebel cause
Nothing really matters to an afternoon
That devils dog
The method in the bottle that
His mama used is smelling salt
Was really just to tell him that
Not every mouth should dental floss
Let him walk
Welcome back
Bobby got the whole strip
Puffing on that blurry
Bumping Journey for the whole trip
Nothing on him sturdy
Just some Murphy’s Oil Soap mixed
With every fuck he gave before
Them strangers took his goldfish
Homesick
Blues
Keep it moving subterranean
Ain’t used a blinker since he threw
Them sinkers in the J.V. gym
Back when Maury wasn’t stories
About some four piece and a baby’s bib
His glory came from swarming in
With Porky’s on your neighbors crib
Take the vig
Gimme gimme cocoa pop
Superball if three’s a crowd
Then he’s allowed to
Tell you that he’s huge in Prague
To lose it all and keep his head
And reinvent the voodoo doll
Then peace and love and beat it
Cuz no telling
What he’ll do to y’all
Who’s the boss?
Who’s the Mack?
Guess who came to dinner
Down on his luck and brought
A couple women that have been around
The block so much they’re taco trucks
That chop you up to bits and bounce
Then shop the aisle for crocodiles
Monster style in and out
It’s about principles
The kids already given up
They’re janators that answer you
In Xanadu with riddles of
Antifreeze by land and sea
The fantasy of sitting ducks
Lined up in a row your boat
And overdosed on different drugs
Zipper stuck tent ripped
Imprint of a sneaker sole
Short wave static and a map
Of all the decent roads
Course grain patterns
Means he had him in a sleeper hold
Whoever did it meant to leave
These mp3s of Lisa Loeb
Speaker phone tough guy
Jump up to get hunger gamed
Street lights covered
By the troubled kids
That love to paint
Coming from where Sonny
Tucked the muddy bucks
In rubber maids
Where sleeping is enough
To get you run up on in
Couples skate
