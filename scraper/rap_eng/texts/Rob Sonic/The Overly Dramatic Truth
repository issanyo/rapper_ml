[Verse 1]
I became for you what you would ask, telepath
You're too young to ask out loud
I'm too old to not know that
I can talk like you've not heard
I know weapons, you think words
I expose you to these terms
You still chose to roll unheard
That could work but not so fast
You're so open, I'm so crass
I'm too weak to hold that back
You still think intrigue will last
Can't imagine of my past
I just can't explain all that
I wish I could trade your place
So romantic, full of faith
I must spare you
I must learn
I refuse to be your first
First to put you in your place
First to make you speed your pace
I'm a man now, good or bad
You're a girl still, good for you
Don't think this don't make me sad
This is something I must do
Come on

[Chorus 1]
Keep your own time, leave me be
Trying to spare you, trying to be
God melodic, man on fire
Coward long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's my fault
Fuck you raw, dog, I can't stop
Should have listened
Should have left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head
I will knit my savage thread
Help me help you walk away
Leave this unamazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace
You still think I'm here to save?
I'm not even really here
I can't give what I can't take

[Verse 2]
What a ride
What a slide under the door
What a score
You think I'm a genius
I know I'm a whore
What a time
What a climate for our lives
What's in store?
You see live forever
All I see is war
I will pull your hair back
Fuck you on the floor
Pour myself into the act
Poor myself, boo-hoo, I'm bad
'Cause I know that these moments end
But telling you the truth is sad
You deserve the ignorance and bliss that I still wish I had
Don't you let me keep you here
Don't ignore my greatest fear
I need you to not need me
You need not believe, just flee
I will put myself inside you
Find some way to run and hide, you
I can't be responsible
Do as I say not as I do

[Chorus 1]
Keep your own time, leave me be
Trying to spare you, trying to be
God melodic, man on fire
Coward long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's my fault
Fuck you raw, dog, I can't stop
Should have listened
Should have left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head
I will knit my savage thread
Help me help you walk away
Leave this unamazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace
You still think I'm here to save?
I'm not even really here
I can't give what I can't take

[Bridge]
This is not my ego talking
I know I'm no perfect draw
And I do love the way you lay there
I do like the way we talk
Maybe I'm just condescending
Maybe this thing isn't wrong
Maybe you should lay right there
Put your hands up in the air

[Chorus 2]
Keep your own time, leave me be
Trying to spare you, trying to be
God melodic, man on fire
Coward long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's your fault
Fuck you raw, dog, I can't stop
Should have listened
Should have left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head
I will knit my savage thread
Help me help you walk away
Leave this unamazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace
You still think I'm here to save?
I was never even here
I can't give what I can't take

[Outro]
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?
You still think I'm here to save?

This is my type of religion
