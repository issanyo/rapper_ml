(Super Duty Tough [Weight])
[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Keep it one hundred, like a fever or a beeper code
This for every hipster, lip your zipper and your "Beat It" coat
Jesus [Jones] right here, mice ears, pet rocks
Supercatafragalista secret words for red hot
Feds watch unmarked cars that look like mommy drove
Karate Kid it's obvious the posse in Miyagi-Do
Bobby don't start and get benched in the fourth
But go harder than your tartar in the Benjamin Moore
Slept on the floor, woke up thinking must escape
"What it is" is "What it is" and what it isn't doesn't pay
Another day, another door that mustn't fall and try to stack
And hit the corner market for the margarine and Dimetapp
The kind of cat to watch with the Comet and the orange Crush
Opposite the [catcher near] the ratchets with the Jordan 1's
Everything is terrible I'm daring you to mountain bike
Master of the puppets, and the freaks that won't come out at night
Leading you around the bend, heading you off at the pass
Squeezing stones until they bled, comparing Orange to Applejack
Rap attack, magic wand, levitating lemon trick
The devil needs to eat well in the details in your breakfast bitch
Put the fire in them riders in the cherry paint
No car, just a Tarzan with the bars
That wants to marry Jane Bailey
Say come to supper filing forks
So lay back motherfucker, don't ride the white horse

[Verse 2: Breeze Brewin]
Yo, usually when you hearing not for nothing
For real I bet it's about something just think of the double negative
Bringing up something relevant, elephant in the room or intelligence to consume
Is you getting this like my dude, there's some devilish type of doom
And it's coming, or is it nothing like but and I'll probably handle this
Forecasting or more foreshadowing, Ozymandias
Until you can't fake it, as it's getting bad breaking
Would you rather hear it or some cavalierish Hank Schrader shit
From critical degrees to reaching pinnacles
You see you need the irons and the niacins, minerals, Marie
And then fuck it the time's up and forget it your rhymes stunk
And yet you couldn't smell the coffee
Until it's could you get him off me?
As you were sinking, you were thinking, I'm good to go
Would you rather have him pull on your coat
Or your foot from your throat
Or a scary scenario like bro you [shouldn't] alone
Or brothers hit you with a tissue for some boogers to blow
Gesundheit or zipper pulled life, the choice yours
And I ain't really talking, people squawking until their voice sore
Just a nonchalant confidant, on some cousin
You best to listen, respect the wisdom with not for nothing
