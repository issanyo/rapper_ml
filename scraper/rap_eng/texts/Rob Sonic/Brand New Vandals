(Chorus)
It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals and handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

(Verse 1)
And it goes like:
Watch the clock it's unplug the sockets
Fox in the hedge of ox edge and pockets
Froze violence of the flow gentle island
Curse like a sailor that's broke, pale, and squallin'
The ball cannon blast laughs last, believe me
Volcanic ash and it falls back to B.C
Your culture is crazy when y'all prays to TVs
From the malls and the stations to the break wall graffitis
We don't need no president smiling from the safe house
Stir the food what other days, what happened to the tapes now
Isn't life remember X the mental state of break down
Exposure to the looking glass a cookie from the waist down
Ruby on some super-dupe whining for the press stills
Sitting ducks at carnivals with tilted fitted fletch bills
Iffy from a jump jump he drum pumping pet pills
Automatic trouble trap and double platinum get kill

(Chorus)
It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals your handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

Truth truth drop drop diamonds in the rough spot
Surf surf crime waves, lining up at bus stop
Work work eat eat feeling like you're hijacked
Back back hate hate the people want their minds back

(Verse 2)
Tip the weight of it but don't break the ice man
Current out a jettison and net him when the kites land
Who controls the pigeons pissing who's on your flight plans
Tonight we ready rumble packs and stumble back with fright fans
Had it all been up to us, we double up on scotch guard
Play the cards that we get dealt, tell chicks that we're rock stars
Flood the place with kerosene and lift the Zippo's top off
Tonight the smokey light of post we're riding in on Doc Marts
Coast, the kings of his bring back the 8-0
8 way sand of the panic attack NATO
Day to day mannequins [?]
Rain coat is lying [?]
Spurs dig deep into the eye horse saddle up
Twin peaks fire ball shit creek paddle stuff
Get some lose more just protect your raffle stubs
Notify the captain and he's laughing when he gaffled us
Jack beef fatal and nasal about the allergins
Outlaws renegades warriors and paladins
Balance on the wire tight balls with the power spins
Trying to find the piece of me that went down with the tower twins

(Chorus)
It's falling into the same old mistakes
It's television and your channels are changed
Before your signals and handles away
And where you went when the vandals invade

Truth truth drop drop diamonds in the rough spot
Surf surf crime waves, lining up at bus stop
Work work eat eat feeling like you're hijacked
Back back hate hate the people want their minds back
