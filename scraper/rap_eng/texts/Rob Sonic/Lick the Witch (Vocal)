[Intro: Rob Sonic]
Hey hey ha
It goes one for the trouble
Hey hey ha
It goes two for the time
Hey hey ha
It goes three for the money
No seriously
Three for your money

[Verse: Rob Sonic]
Little tike too
He get his work on
In the outhouse paintin' tell Satan to keep his shirt on
Burdened by a thirst that comes worse if it's downstream
Tongue on his telly in mully Canal Jeans
Wade through the vomit and pockets of dinosaurs
Shout "let 'em eat the cake"
Shaking a rhino's horn
Been a minute where they spit with a long loogie
Pop gon' rap like he trapped in the wrong movie
A clumsy waiter who catered his own show
MTV crib in the ribbons of mobile homes
Floss the baby batter when power gets used wrong
Carbon people walk all over me into my tombstone
Madoffs and Adolfs
Stray dogs in plain clothes
Euros turn to dollars and dollars turn into pesos
Cold cocked
Shocked by the dude dirty
X's on his eyes with stars and the blue birdies
Still gold
This money got steel-toed
Pulling hell out of his hat and a train with his earlobe
He heel roll
Crooked, seedy with green thought
A bench warmer groomed for greedy marine corps
Seen your game, matched it
Incubated and hatched it
Nurtured it and fed it and when it trusted him he smacked it
Grew up to despise him and try him at all turns
But when it visits home it knows it should call first
Up against the wall
What it do, how's your credit
Arms up, legs apart
Marching calisthenics
Don't sweat it
Your purpose is pre-trained
Until your pinky-finger is swinging from keychains
Aiming for the mouth hope to get a bronze star
Hands up on his feet pick your teeth with lawn darts
Jumping jack rabbit his magic is deep shadow
Asshole this is foot
Body this is Tobacco
