[Intro: Rob Sonic]
Here's a little something for the lost and found
If the mallon ain't on, then we're walking out
What you talking 'bout? You can't be serious
Cause we don't even know what year it is
2000 and 1985, on New Year's Eve or the day we die
In a Ryder truck, with the trailer open
Protocol overall is lederhosen

[Verse Intro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me, what you been doing

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
Soldering an organ from the '70's
Other hand harvesting the organs of my enemies
If in pursuit of feeder fish, he forgo any pleasantries
Bonfires eating into ornamental effigies
At a odd orbit, not a part of the public
Part of a mob forged in worn carnival justice
Trust, that's what a playboy be on
One quarter straight, no save point respawn

[Verse Intro]

[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]
Gettin' Ziggy with it
Biting the hand that feeds Lenny and Squiggy with it
Lord of the flies with more eyes on his pinky digit
I am Bobby Freedom, and this is 60 minutes
Tar boil, coil with hood spread
Gargoyle then foil the good bets
Part spoiled and loyally book bed
And char broil the soil with oily footsteps
