That's it baby
YES!
I'mma do some new shit, some new new shit off the new album
Never been done before

I'mma do it
Long Beach
Flip that, flip that

(Verse 1)
Involve etiquette medicine freeze
Mother is a pill still fresh from debris
Some fire chance fire Manson degrees
And yes I am still
Watchin' it
Look liver spots on a 30 year face
Dirty ear wax luggin' systems around
Illegitimate tax on my cigarette packs
Need another eighth coulda built some more jail
Pale in comparison the ford ______?
Prices like his we could read before sleep
Cheap sucker Schwinn with banana bike seat
Golden arch falling on my card charge fee
Hard wheat harvest for the rain that we need
Speedy recover like a pied in cocoon
Got it in tune slightly high middle C
But it'll be another month before I bark at the moon

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits, it's allowed this

(Verse 2)
Don't interrupt interact
Or play with matches memories some of us never catch
Interference stays like a radar
But stays in the pace maker facin' off of microwaves
Nova casa blank add a thanks to your look
If I only had a tank I'd get more bang for my buck
Sam got a ____ (sand?) for the park thinking lot
And I can't believe that I'm still
Watchin' it
In a van in remote palacades staken' out
Nile west bio(vile?)-test til we're all taken out
When you're walkin' off it's only three miles wide
You're not a human you're a sardine that knows too much
Nine million motherfucks who all cook with gas
Will make the best damn rocket you've ever seen
Am-pheta-mine, left a
Space between me and your target group

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits, it's allowed this

The eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon
Yea, the eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon

(Verse 3)
Justified leach please get off my skin
Found on the shore of anything but syringe
Threw a brick through the zenith before I turned in
So now I am no longer
Watchin' it
Everything is a dot since I took the bait
Hooked on new practices like dodging Mars
And crunching numbers that I'll never make
And collecting passengers for plastic cars
I'm still the same person, I just lost my faith
In a round about way I read much bluer
Newer my circumference in the mind it makes
Dates move, straight through, time stop, get fuel

(Chorus)
Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits it's allowed this

The eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon
Yea, the eyes of my house can't close enough
Since I was told we'd be out of air soon

We are
Watchin' it
They are
Watchin' it
All are
Watchin' it
We (or Be) still
Watchin' it
(You or We or Be) still
Watchin' it
They still
Watchin' it
We are
Watchin' it
They are
Watchin' it

Sex
