[Chorus]
Yeah that was nice
We got something here for you
On mile 86
In the running shoes

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Almost hit the beat meter
Petrol operate
Promo cop, souvenir
New veneer focus fade
Lens cover manage it
Seize my abandoned ship
Please write the management
It seems like they'll answer it
Bland hour, man power
[?] grips
Raid like a sonogram on [?]'s tits
Jade like an olive branch while advantaged
A mate to the potted plant college campus
Modern life [?] either we move
Three of these near the seats to the rear view
Scream near the [?] machine and over brief news
Reflect to the mirror max I'm hearing that too
Telicatessen with the [?] of [?] and the Sherlock Holmes magnified
You're at home feeling
The Moloch of [?] and the counter stop staring
Get your air, move on there'll be no fights or fair ones

[Chorus]
Yeah that was nice
And don't forget your change
See, there's an ATM
Near the shooting range

[Verse 2]
Just before the pharmacy heater space rabies shot
Near the soap shakers bye, leave you dope make the shot
Triple X heard it from simple tech version of almanacs burning up
Image less merger stock
Search from a barbed wire sarcastic
And learn by a hard-wired pile of plastic
Figurines [?]
Your painted wing taking' you to Saint Patrick
Faster than stats go madness pro quid
Jacob's loan adderall javis Joseph
Make em throw sat alone, tragic moments
And bottle em and package em cause that's show-biz
Telicatessen with the dry heat's yelling' for the out-of-date method that was no longer selling
Us noise making people never stop when you tell em
Just be swift with your [?] and no it's not welcome

[Chorus]
Yeah that was nice
We're open 8 to 4
Bring your gas and guns
And your back supports

[Verse 3]
Every little thing you have will suck like a rent-a-vac
And your parade [?] placement will tend to that
Chance only one I take they ban what I wanna say
Out through an open picture Poor Richard's Almanac
When the taste disappears it's a clear sign
An act of upper-lower-case Ritalin climb
Half state thrown away to make it small time
To engineer the vision of the river quinine
Stuff you never needed plus the things that you do like a lightweight pistol grip missile tattoo
A brain reading sham that your hands attach to
An armor plate just in case someone attacks you
Telicatessen with the hot sale smoking on it yesterday's specials on the locks that were broken
The washy eye crocodile tears that were showing
When they changed every one of us with none of us knowing

[Chorus]
Yeah that was nice
(T E L I C A T E S S E N)
Yeah that was nice
(T E L I C A T E S S E N)
Yeah that was nice
(T E L I C A T E S S E N)
Yeah that was nice
(T E L I C A T E S S E N)
Yeah that was nice
