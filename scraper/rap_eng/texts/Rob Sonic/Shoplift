[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Boom town Babe Ruth, facts or IMAX, some cattle prod THX Apple rot faction
Path of lines overlook show the cooks that I know "all work no play" makes me American
Band stand band-bot through the rant, mellotron, layin down news in a voodoo chant telethon
Juicy Fruit economic jag sell your arm processed pick me up, caffeinate Lebanon
Bio feedback, red alert cosmonaut, pyro recap, weekend end body rot
Evening copy post featuring yours truly, legs running on triple-A horseshoe
Simulate test crash, dummy bomb radiance rooftop view value like Arabian
Nights fuse live through concerts, and maybe then on draft day my acts play taps like I'm sapient

[Chorus]
Red flag, (hoot) jet lag, (hoot) hooligan chemical
A success (hoot) obsessed(hoot), super incredible

[Verse 2]
New neighbor feeling with my close friends, both ends
Whip burn, Chick Hearn, and dedicated broken
I'll sock it to em', baptized by pollution
Capsized minor moving W-M-D
Double goose, rent free, Penn station mezzanine, Hotel Roosevelt, ten ways to get you clean
Cell phone rap, co-self a set machine, model Kojak, nobel amenities
"Houston", you're breaking up! Did you see your panel fall?
Too many figuring for making me a cannon ball
Standing tall, only 'cause right now the bus is late
All war cannot cure, ready, set, suffocate
Drawing for blister pack one-a-day, switch your screen
This and that, tick for tack, cutaway
Striker tail vitamin, nitrous ox glycerin under tongue
Plus I got that stroke down profane

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Project Yucatan, Modest model hooligan, (?) , jumper gotta fuel the man
Jog west (?) energize super dam, enterprise peace put your beef like a nugent fan
Who the van pressure washed I occur innermost teleprompts in the scope quieter
Branchin' out sick, passing out by the curb, "will I", "should I", "would I" kill you for crashing my firebird?
Polaroid of me by the back room, monitor relentlessly a problematic bad mood
(?) saint single partied out
Started off slow, but Iâ€™m in the fucking army now

[Chorus]
