[Intro: Rob Sonic]
Bobby got the whole house draped
In Pagliacci tone clown paint
His foxy mamas hold out grapes
And lollipop his whole pound cake

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Sucka’ shit, dug your ditch
Old to know, dust to win
Hoverin’, above the rim
With water-boarding wonder twins
Run with kids that stay on guard
And raise the bars like jungle gyms
And governments that break our hearts
And play the parts of Cousin Itt
Witness the dawn of the stay-awakes
A fifth in a fog is his patron saint
And who assume a blews' a dues
And too much proof to make it rain
And chew some shrooms and flew the coup
With moose balloon on Macy’s day
Eighty-eight pop-lock going home his door-a-jar
Ripple may with triple-A and cobra bones
I’m going in with nothing left but bubble vest and poamy pro
Wingsy eye for Jager bombs and made your time to holy ghost
DOA eat, sleep, void sale
Eyeing whores that kinda’ sorta’ drives you to enjoy jail
Season of the witches with them diatribe deployed nails
And all them bitches problems, I got ninety-nine voicemails
Ride behind me, stayin’ on your, take you to a vacant lot
I put you to the margin, till your own department take a rise
And once you see the Venus in Adidas you can stay or not
And I’ll be in the clunker like my other car’s a mega yacht

[Verse 2: Onry Ozzborn]
Salem all over again
It freaks them out when they can understand so thus interrupt
It’s how they go about it plotin’ (plotin’)
Schemin’ and waddlin’ while trying to bottle lightning
Coping mechanism more frighten
We on the other hand, sharp like Freddy’s right (right)
Hoarse, in carriage terror we tangle throughout the night (night)
Ornament, case the cottage
Windows stained with gothic imagery reenactments of Bobby and I throwing objects at the goblins
Shout out to Devil when you kneel
I am convinced that genuflects had better work to skrim ‘em out
To shove within that trough eatin’ riddles of those retreatin’ (run)
Off to the boonies since they can’t feel their faces on weekends
And Friday nights have already arrived in the glass slipper (yeah)
Vinter quiver which warms her up shiver so we deliver her volatile model babble (true)
Voice our opinion to aristocrats of annual sacrifices we handle
While holding the lantern flutters it’s candle flame dances is epitome while dismantling becomes gradual (yeah)
Another one’s well lit as it (as if)
Rolling my eyes like five little filial approves I’m hit (it does)
While in this case, it does
Nickle insides father the author of somber doves
Artificial intelligence versus third kind encounter while humans become inferior victims of the witching hour
