I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know

I'm the man little do they know
Rollin' up dope and syrup got me slow
Po anotha deuce I done rolled up a four
I be in the papers, in the streets, in ya ho
All the windows down in the foreign riding slow
King louie banging like the folks and the Moe's
Prolly overdose if I take another dose
Can't fuck with me you ain't making no dough
These niggas working they ain't working no mo'(feds)
I'm neo dey on agent flow
Video, smoking dope with a Asian ho
Throwin' up L's that's the way it goes
I made it bro, and they hated though
I just say so, and chase that dough
Beat the pussy up like I hate yo ho
Shoot 'em in it til it ain't the face no more
Ballin' like a young nigga tryna go pro
Smoking on def call that so so
Jammin' like the gun ain't shooting no more
I know you don't know 'cause you don't do a lil mo
I'ma big G nigga you lil ho
We be out in cali smoking O's buying clothes
Go against the team and your gonna get exposed
Rapid face shots nigga adi to the os

I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
I'm the man little do they know, little do they know

I'm the man little do they know
Bump a nigga hoe she like tell me when to go
No love makin' bacc to makin' that doe
Who the fuck is you bitch I own MUBU
Swaggin' in my louie and I own Gucc too
I'm slow mo' 'cause I'm off two two's
Dirty money got my pockets on bruce bruce
Thirty popper tools for tha obsticles
Do a hoe bad tell a bitch roof roof
Actin hard to get bitch you ain't lou proof
These niggas ain't me no they ain't too cool
Kush too strong bitch free b smoove
You can be smoove or we can eat tools
Shoot this bitch up man it's all on you
Shoot a nigga down make 'em fall on you
More rounds poppin off gettin' all on you
Throw money at the factory it fall on you
Lean Wallgreens and the ganja troop
Every nigga wit' me armed and'll shoot
Ball like I hoop fucc a nigga bitch
Throw the two's call it coupe
Bitches on dicc hella love in the crew
Everyday I win call me W
These niggas hate these bitches love Lou Lou
Fuck you

I'm the man little do they know, little do they know
