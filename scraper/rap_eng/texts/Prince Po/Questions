[Poetry] Yo, yo, yo, yo Pharoahe
[Monch] Right, right
[Poetry] Brother why don't you explain
How did hip-hop get caught up in this ill rap game?

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo, I got a question - in hip-hop, who they followin? (Uhh)
The niggas with skills or them niggas who be hollerin?

[Prince Poetry]
Them niggas that be hollerin is substitute, modelin
Niggas with skills always and forever keeps a followin

[Both] Swallowin pride
[Monch] Never we be imperialistic
[Both] Who rips shit, without bein materialistic
[Monch] Statistics show
[Poet] Ask miss she know
[Apani] Just cause the niggas got dough don't mean they got that flow
[Monch] Riiiight
[Both] Just cause them niggas got dough don't mean they got that flow

[Prince Poetry]
What?! Nigga you can consider it the bomb if I spit on it, get on it
Ride for a little bit, feel how your inner get
From internet, intellect, vibes that I'm sendin it
Now your soul bubblin brown sugar so you'll remember it
Legitimate, imminent, crash course for illiterate
From August to September, Prince is heavenly given it
From center split, train of thoughts that's mad booty
Cause you twisted and rudey don't mean everything's
GROOVY when you hear it, the world's gonna feel it before I say it
Now some pop some shit, but the labels get the big G's from sales
(Whooo!) Nobody sayin shit it just smells
Here's some Southside Saturday love like Shamelle's
My syndicate is tight, quite right for these times
Contradictin all the hype, the berry-more-black shines
ALL MINE, fine wines to dine rhymes
For forty projects, keepin it Naughty like Treach

[Monch] Ahhhhhhhh YO PRINCE
[Poetry] Yes sir

Pleeease man
I done burned some of the most fattest MC's like chromium percolinate
It's not even tangible for them to understand the holy weight
It takes soul to make a crowd animated
Prince stated, hey wait 'til we get off that label
And I waited twelve months (twelve months) for the perfect opportunity
To thump (thump) bump (bump) somethin loved by my community (c'mon)
I'm movin on all you punk Bambino bastards
Your style's depleted like muscles without amino acids
I blast kids with mass times matter
Forever clingin to endeavors defined, clever words
Thus waiting never, frustrating verbs to rip
My rap ratings erradicate (erradicate shit)
For me to take rhythms and mate 'em with rhymes in mating season
Creating shit never before made it
I'm makin hybrids, created potent enough to open eyelids
And leave pupils dilated, stress is alleviated
Now it's easier, plus economically feasible
For me to leave rap listeners queasy and inebriated
We made it we came, dedicated we rated supreme
Even with or without the cream

[Poetry] Yo, yo Pharoahe
[Monch] Yes, sir
[Poetry] Brother why don't you explain
