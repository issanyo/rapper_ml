Surviving in the Desert
War, blocks, hood, cops

Yea, get it in
Surviving in the Desert
Get right

Verse 1 (Marquee)

Five boroughs to the east
Survive famine or feast
Desert rock fitted's low
Camo, constructions, white tees
Cops parole the beats
Profile, clamor and creep
Say the crime rate decreased
Still every corner's a reef
Consequences is steep
Somebody getting knocked as we speak
Criminalizing mystique
Outside the climate is heat
Get it popping play for keeps
Nobody too hard to reach
Cold blooded arrangements
Exchange fire for peace
Let it out
It's like they get some type of
Rush on release
Right to Crowe's funeral home
To put away the deceased
Ghosts of South Road
Shore ave, 150th Street
Cycle repeats team Southside
To Rockaway Beach
Back and forth project to project
It's ricochet beef
Wall to wall liquor stores, salons
Ten dollar boutiques
Barber shops, Bodegas
Big ups to Yemins and Sikhs
No eye witness accounts
News reporters
Die when they speak

Chorus

Surviving in the Desert
(Q.N.S that's where I'm from)
Surviving in the Desert
(Camofloge fatigues built to battle these streets)
Pop off you know it's real
Surviving in the Desert
(Street celebrities carry on gangsta legacies)
Surviving in the Desert
It's on we hold the steel

Verse 2 (Prince Po)

Yo
Catch, run and kiss
Tag, skellly to hop scotch
Stick ball, pop-a-wheelies
Double-dutch and blocked shots
Sick handle, wicked cross over
And dumb hops
But what happened a lot
Is the fun stopped from the gun shots
But it's signs of no improvement
Dope and coke is moving
Then came the Crack Era
Woah, who would've knew it?
Number holes already fluent
Sam tried to rob them OG'S
And got shot in Queens
They call that straight music
Moving keys like chick corea on piano
And not like these new niggas
That be singing in soprano
We don't even snitch on enemies
Boo Harvey handle
Southside early named a dirty
Cop Rambo
40 P, Baisley, Lefrak to the Hammels
Ocean Ville, QB Ravenswood
All animal
The biggest borough,  thorough
Check the Status
Prince Po, Nature, MARQUEE
Nigga get at us

Chorus


Verse 3 (Nature)
Ah, yo
What happened to the family
Tight knitted community
Spending all the money
On weed, belts and jewelry
Trying to fucking all of these girls
That went to school with me
Trying to shoot all of these dudes
That wasn't cool with me
And it don't matter who your cousin
Or your brother was
I nominated myself the hood govenor
If you ain't come from this dirt
Then you ain't one of us
Can't ride on this bus
You can't run with us
Especially if the rents too high
Baby daddy left only see him two times
Birthdays and Christmas
Put it on your calendar
Daddy got a young girl
Really doesn't matter though
Ass so fat
It remind me of a cantaloupe
Gotta sell Crack
Got me living like a animal
Trying to survive up in the jungle
Gotta master the art of war
Sun Tzu

Chorus

Verse 4 (Prince Po)

Queens get the money
Niggas shake for cash
Catch you on the back streets
Make you part of the trash
Fucking up consignment
Thinking it's sweet, hold that
Told me you got me this week
Call that a throw back
Chinese food
Slinging crills in the rain
Hugging the block
Smoking sour for the pain
Gotta a whip but don't trip
I fucking with the E train
OG'S pass the jewels
And it's never in vein

Verse 5 (Marquee)

Too many legends to name
Carved our spot in the grain
We could leave right now
And the rep still remain
Neighborhood folklore
Gangsters, territorial coke wars
Crack fame, drug lords
In the grave or the up north
Rappers so lyrical
It touches your body spiritual
Minute you hear it you feel it's
Nothing you could compare it to
Home of the bad honeys
From B.A.P.S t o snow bunnies
Queens synonymous to fly
Good living and long money

Chorus
