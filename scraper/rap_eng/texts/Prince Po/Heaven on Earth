[Chorus - Prince Po']
Been through some shit
Felt the pain
Refused to quit
Stepped up my game
Little talk was my gift
Now they scream my name
International trips, life ain't the same
Above being rich, I recognise my worth
Break bread, but I'm doing me first
So rock a Ace of Spade to quench the thirst
This church is the rebirth, welcome
To Heaven on Earth


[Verse 1 - Prince Po']
I'm a hot mess, that's what she said
When I'm just a man, rushing to stay ahead
New day, give thanks, have breakfast in bed
Driven like the Audi 8, stressin' is dead
I address my affairs, strategic
Bash get the bread
Haters is heated
Work hard play hard
Now we in Saint Charles
Jet Skis squeezing on a
Thank god, for beauty that she's in
Spittin' the fork
Feeding hella peen
Nigga Italy
Brought up in the passion and chivalry
We smashin'
Livin' to the last, you feelin' me?
If not, oh well, 5-Star Hotel, a Four Seasons
No work I'm on reasons
To turn up (Turn up!)
On a quest to ingest the best
Doing the most, rhyme the vest and move some folks, go!

[Interlude - Xperience]
And I work all day
No blood on my hands
Just dirt on my face, yeah
And I believe that I'm strong
Demons on my skeets while I sing my song
Like, Is this paradise
Or heaven on earth cause I'm scared of heights
Lord if you can hear
I'll be home soon with a couple souvenirs, oh lord..


[Verse 2 - Xperience]
Food for thought for people gotta eat
During the recession we was treated like kings
Mind over matter, that's death to the body
Like bottles of my sound blowing 'cess at the party
In bullshit with two women lookin' to pull you in
Cause you went straight into a galley from the bullpen
And these hoes want me to swing low
They only out for the drink, money, and weed smoke
So I hailed Mary a cab
Tippin' a chariot fast
Embodies Judas's scariest mask
There's a body bag, for everybody gettin' his worth
The way he spittin', pimpin'
Must have found his heaven on earth
Get it?
Step in the club like I step in the church
Slappin' niggas with holy water, I'm quenching they thirst
They undergo a metamorphosis, remember they worth
And commence to being the god in the flesh, returned, rebirth

[Chorus - Prince Po']
Been through some shit
Felt the pain
Refused to quit
Stepped up my game
Little talk was my gift
Now they scream my name
International trips, life ain't the same
Above being rich, I recognise my worth
Break bread, but I'm doing me first
So rock a Ace of Spade to quench the thirst
This church is the rebirth, welcome
To Heaven on Earth

[Verse 3 - Aesop Rock]
Eighty percent of my life untangling headphones
The other twenty gettin' jumpy when the bell tolls
Terribly
I'm paint thinner tragedy, film chopes and therapy
Mostly here to question the hegemony, yup
Back-talk with a bastion of bad luck
Brash tongue, batshit, sipping on black sludge; haggard
Lookin' like he walked out a mind fire
Ate from a trashcan, slept on a hype wire
Never mind the worsening pity it conjures
I'm lost in a version of heaven, just not yours, I
Found god in the Oddworld slot
Where it's not the impossible crap y'all thought
Manic, offering bible fan-fic of a tribal
Music and dire finances
Freedom is an unkempt pigpen
All dirt on earth, as it is in...

Heaven
