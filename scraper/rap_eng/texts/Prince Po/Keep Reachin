[Verse 1]
Emotions get involved
When you're more loyal than most
Tryna get between your broad
But don't wanna spoil your host
Shit ain't holly sweet, but for you
I'll sugarcoat it
Hope you get on your feet
And your flee, them boogers bought it
I don't like to judge dawgs
And I don't do gossip
I'm just into street love(?)
A soul move a prophet
The music created to make
People feel good
Now reach beyond the stars
When it's my turn to rock it
Made the best out of the worst situations
Wait far from finish, but above all ungrateful
Y'all getting some stagnant, not some limitations
Time to evolve, I'm sorry I had to shape you
[?] my figure committed to the hustle
The dudes I move with give it a little more muscle
We taking a stride, y'all take it for granted
Now baby lets take it and vibe
Stay around the planet

[Hook]
I keep reaching, they keep pulling
It's breaking me up inside
Y'all keep sleeping
What I'm doing
Living dreams, how, that's why I
I'd rather speak to myself right now
Cause ain't it never good when you're trying to help out

[Verse 2]
Broke bread with the folks until the loaf was gone
Same good intention when i'm composing a song
In another dimension the haze dipping? the tension
My inspiration in recitals help you stay strong
I do it for my heart cause Gods there
Fed a couple of cats, they probably wanting me dead
Straight scheming when I was just trying to share
Better be careful cause karma's a motherfucker
Never thought i'd see Brazil, London and Spain
Walking across the bridge by Big Ben in the rain
Humble cause i'm just a regular nigga from Queens
Who got a lot of jewels but I don't rock a chain
I'd rather grab my guns and help me chase your dreams
Now to get at the ones who's in the struggle like you
You need some education to partake in some things
These visuals are colour blind that's why they shine through

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's sweeter when they sleeping
I work hard play hard
Maui on the weekend
I few got it [?] so I had to dismiss them
Hate to see them drown and fall off at the deep end
Still shining like sun all across the land
The autobot bionic boogie band be creeping
Smoother than the waves that run up on the sand
Laughing cause there's nothing else to do but keep reachin'

[Outro]
Yeah, Yeah, my name is Greezy Junior. Greezy Junior!
Hey, hey hey young world, the world is young
You see Prince Po asked me to come through and drop some homegrown empire state
Nigga I'm trying to tell you something black maxwell smart heron bone
Three finger ring with diamonds jewels on you motherfuckers
Motherfuckers always, always talking about whats fucked up
Or somebody who is fucking up or always trying to tell what is it
Or what ain't happening
Fuck outta here!
You gotta speak on shit with meaning, put some shit in the air
