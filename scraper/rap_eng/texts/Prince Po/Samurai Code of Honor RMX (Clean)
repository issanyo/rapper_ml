L.I.F.E. Long & Big Ape ft. Prince Po & U.G. - “Samurai Code of Honor RMX”
[Emcee(s): Prince Po, L.I.F.E. Long, and U.G.]
[Producer(s): Big Ape]

[Intro: Prince Po and L.I.F.E. Long]
Prince Po: OK, L.I.F.E.  Let’s go.  Another blessing
L.I.F.E. Long: Yes.  What?  Mmm.  Mmm, yes

[Verse 1: Prince Po]
Between the grooves like wet soil, forever loyal.  Shoot half
The track—the rest is a wrap like aluminum foil.  No time
To slack.  Ch-ch get hot as deserts in Iraq.  Critical
Times, spiritual minds, so many pitiful raps
Spit a few rhymes that smack you overanalytical
Cats, riddle through backstreets.  Dagger slit a few perhaps
You didn’t know Po’s a ninja, master of [?]
Avenger.  L.I.F.E. and U.G. about to son dukes, so relax

[Verse 2: L.I.F.E. Long]
Whoo!  The pen truly is mightier than
The sword.  Fight with sharp words, scar eardrums
On tour.  Early up in the dojo, practicing my
Form.  Stronghold organized with Dwellas.  Then we
Swarm, using leaf-fleet techniques, walk over eight beats
Swing blades in camouflaged kimonos on Swedish
Streets, learn from the masters Prince Po and U.-
-G. how to use Tai Chi to balance pens like
Bladed weaponry

[Verse 3: U.G.]
Yeah, [?]
[?] jump, chop with blade in
Hand, land with part of your face in my hand
Vanish into sand.  I am the deadliest sword-swinger
In between my thumb and forefingers is the soul-splitter
I’ll soak in rivers to replenish me, energy
Enemies defenses weak.  See, my inner chi
Enters me and causes my strength to evolve
Assassin, hyena-style, kill by my laughing

[Hook: L.I.F.E. Long, U.G., and Prince Po]
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[U.G.]
Samurai code of honor.  Sword out
The war route is what we take, stomp your armor
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[Prince Po]
Samurai code of honor, loyal, the crown
Royal soldiers in the midst of lies and drama

[Verse 4: L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  Drama, there in a
Second.  Trapped in the game like Tekken, learning life’s lesson
It’s animated where we’re resting.  Urban tenements
Exchange words with high priests, Shaolin residents

[Verse 5: U.G.]
From out of the
Rumble, I’ll rise, blood in my eyes, Timbs tied
Revenge in heart [?] my veins.  My body’s in pain
I’m bruised, battered, and scarred.  Lose half of your arm
Lose half of your armor.  We warned you

[Verse 6: Prince Po]
Smoke cliques like ganja in bongs, get in your ass like
Thongs, fight demons.  Life-breathing through songs.  My legion’s
From a region where it’s freezing with heaters—don’t get it wrong
We’re straight G’s with reason.  Sweden, let’s get it on

[Hook: L.I.F.E. Long, U.G., and Prince Po]
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[U.G.]
Samurai code of honor.  Sword out
The war route is what we take, stomp your armor
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[Prince Po]
Samurai code of honor, loyal, the crown
Royal soldiers in the midst of lies and drama

[Verse 7: U.G.]
Between
Trees, I’ll dip and weave and leave enemies
With no knees.  I’ll fold leaves and feed off ‘em
U.G.’s awesome.  Branches, leap off ‘em
Creep flossing, my blowgun folds dun

[Verse 8: Prince Po]
Sho-
-gun, Po done chosen.  Flows run
Through your veins.  So strung, expose the lung in your brains
Breathe easy.  Samurai get greasy on the grind, shake
The chain, slash wack rappers, smash, and get cheesy

[Verse 9: L.I.F.E. Long]
For sheezy.  Imagine and fathom this combined intelli-
-gence, this secret guild of the advanced para-
-graph specialists.  The craftmanship too incredible
Rememorable, remarkable samurai shoguns
Hold down the fort until the U.S. and Scandinavian
Continents are one

[Hook: L.I.F.E. Long, U.G., and Prince Po]
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[U.G.]
Samurai code of honor.  Sword out
The war route is what we take, stomp your armor
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Samurai code of honor.  There in
A second in the sight of drama, protect the honor
[Prince Po]
Samurai code of honor, loyal, the crown
Royal soldiers in the midst of lies and drama

[Outro: Sample from Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)]
Ghost Dog: Way of the samurai... He should be able to perform one more action... Even if a samurai’s head would be suddenly cut off
