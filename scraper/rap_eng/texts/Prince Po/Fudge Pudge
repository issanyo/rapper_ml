[Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
Yeah, yeah
I think, I think Prince should go first on this one
(You think so?) Yeah I think so
(I think so too, get it live)

[Verse 1: Prince Poetry]
Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me knowin I'm the Prince Po-
-E-T-R-Y, yes and I'm the first batter
The Pharoahe usually go first, but it don't matter (Nah it don't matter)
Funky slices of beats like this
Comes once in a blue, but it's not hard for me to chew
So kick off your shoes and don't forget your socks
I wash and wash up emcees like Clorox
Skills I have, good and plenty
If you want dope lyrics plus ill gimmicks gimme
Beats, equivalent to this, something that I can
Float (float), float (float), float on
It's gettin breezy so kiddies'll keep ya coat on
When I proceed to light the party
In the summer, somethin like a Mardi
Gras, bikinis, panties, bras
Juicin em and I'm suckin the girls up like straws
Oops, upside ya dome
I don't answer the phone when I'm home not alone on the bone
Leave your name and your number and a brief message
At the end of the tone (Booop)
Oooooh, and I like it
Cause I'm Poetry the psychic
Intellectual lovable brother - nah, nah I don't like that
Yo yo scratch that (you can do better than that) one more time
Rollin lyrics, off the tip of my tongue (swing)
I swing (swing), I swang (swang), I swung (swung)
Bringin you the news like Kaity Tong
But I'm not a pretty oriental specimen from
"Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy"
I love the women but I don't try to see em
I'd rather make the money bein on the cover of EM
Get emcees mad make them flare up nostrils
I'm Poetry the rap fanatic I get hostile

Yeah (hostile, hostile, hostile)
Can I can I get a beat?
Yo, Pharoahe's up next yo, yo Monch
Kick it Monch

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party with a mass amount of hookers
Slip and slide, I sling the sludge
(Fudge) fudge (pudge) pudge, will never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
(The organisms are the jury) guess who's the judge?
(You!) I hit the hook heavy
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I'm bigger why pitter-patter
Prouncin on particular poets who persist to portray professional punks
You're just a pussy [meow]
Cat when I'm deckin you
Disrespectin you, clever whenever I select
A new dialogue, one plus one
Get it together, girls don't despair cause I'll be your
"Fair Weather Friend," friend
No I don't have a Benz and no I don't have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of meat will be the remedy
When I pull up to your bumper
Cause I'll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you'll never hate it (hate it)
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I'm rated
I tell you now that I can give good love
Yes I'm the one you should love (tell us about it)
So don't try to diss Fudge Pudge
Cause it's alright, with, me
Kick slick rhymes out of the mouth
Tricky in a joust, plus I'm down with Mickey Mouse
C'mon everyone, lets flow to the rhythm of my tongue
To the rhythm of the drum
Emcees wanna battle but they can't get with the
Capital M-O-N-C-H on the mic I get swifter
Than the rest of them maybe even the best
Scoring 101 in a poetical test
So O.C., if you know who you are
Get on the mic become a superstar

[Verse 3: O.C.]
The form I signify is cultivated why spread it
Many many lyrics memorized embedded
In my think tank sharp as a shank knife
I strike the mic just as quick as a snake bite
Suck out the poison, yeah go 'head, try it
Skills of an assassin, watch as I'll fly
Thorough, doesn't matter the borough I'm swingin
Clear to the end keep the party people clingin
Treatin emcees like government cheese
Shred 'em like cheddar cut 'em up cause P's
Laid out on the bed while we write to the tracks
He's so funny when it comes to the snaps
Write a hardcore rhyme, that's what the boy said
I could whip up a rhyme that could slice a boar's head
No that's ham, and we don't digest that
Organism that's made of dog and a rat
So fee-fi-fum, everybody's Funky Drummin it
When you hear the bassline, you'll be hummin it
I'm keepin it simple cause I can swing many ways
Rappers get met, cause MET it pays
It's a mad mad world and it's best to never wild out
Go against me and I'm quick to pull out
The driveway, by the way hey
Picked up your girl 'cause she was goin my way
Hand on the stick, foot on the clutch
Flowin over eighty miles per hour, I'll pull it on outta
Skid marks left on the ground like tattoos
The rubber smell badder than the doodoo on your shoes
You stink, better think wise is what I advise
'Cause O.C. has skills to kill a whole tribe
Off, awkward, spaghetti I'll sauce it
Lyrics flow like fluid out of a faucet

[Outro]
Yeahhh...(adlibs), here we go (woo)
Here we go, here we go

To the organisms, to the organisms (repeat)
