[Prince Poetry]
Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon
Confusin' the mentabolism in men and women with
Lyrical recitals that I'm givin', some consider
Me an intellectual hip-hop transmitter

[Pharoahe Monch]
Lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I flow to many rhythms, to many rhythms
I rhyme, off of the tempo, simplistic
But consequently distorts the instrumentality
Causin' an illusion
Organized, but at the same time, Konfusing

[Prince Poetry]
Wack emceees, your time is up!
Your rhymin' suck (suck), on my stack
Your climbin' up but not to par, Prince, Poetry possesses
The correct literature showin' you who the best is
Behold the Prince rose to the special occasion
Servin' a bowl of Bran with the extra Raisin
Organized Konfusion blastin' you with a
Missile, designed for a ripper, rippin' up mics
For crowds just like anybody
Who rocks parties 'cause we carry Good-N-Plenty

[Pharoahe Monch]
Many-many- many- many many moons ago
When I reminisce I used to flow to slow
Beats, keepin' the pace straight
Capital M capital O capital N capital C
Capital H relates to a terrific
So never anticipate on a specific style
When I stiplificate, my hieroglyphic file, wait
I'm the prolific child (these... are...)
Styles are simplistic (when) we rhyme
Like a lime (to a lemon) and a lemon (to a lime)
