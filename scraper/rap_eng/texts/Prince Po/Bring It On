[Chorus]
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Moncha, I even be gettin' more graphic
Than a Neo-Geo thirty-two bit computer chip
Be slipped between my lips and then I'll spit
Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead, spit it out
That itty-bitty style you upchuck
Better believe I butt-fuck MCs from the rear
It appears you're stuck up
It's my terminology that strikes the mind
And rips this beat apart
You know the many styles I choose
Will bruise crews from the start
I flow awkwardly, that's awkwardly I flow, that's to the rhythm
Incisions are made into the brain
And then I begin to give 'em a lobotomy, follow me
I'm shapin' your brain like pottery all over the track
Gimme the P-H, gimme the A-R
Gimme the O-A, gimme the H-E, Pharoahe
Crazy poison tip arrows are hittin' you from all directions
You cannot dodge or manage to dislodge them
From the point at which they are connecting
I am s-s-selecting a n-n-n-new style-style
For the p-pile-piles of MC's who try to get buck-buckwild
F-F-F-Fuck that! When I'm in a renovative state of mind
I'm innovative, never been afraid of rockin' the microphone
I'm prone to be eliminating
Cling when I sing a song of sixpence
If it makes sense then sing along
Cling along to my nuts if you got guts then bring it on

[Chorus]
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
There is no equivalent one consider me the epitome of rhymes
Rhythm to techs execution is parallel to them with an exception of the organisms
My telepathy cannot be dismantled so stop sweatin' me
Advanced data, now watch your greater updates and raps get trampled
Fee-fi-fo steps up elevations show
That I'm ahead of your time, specifically right behind a dope rhyme
Rippin' shit up at prime time, I'm Optimus Prime/time material
Imperial wizard of vocabularic havoc I eat MC's like cereal!
That's soggy, milky skills like Mister Miyagi
When it's foggy I release globby spits of remains of rappers in the lobby as a hobby
I'LL, rip your nit-SHIT GET STICK QUICK, GET YOUR CREW - before I do
Something gory to your quite futile STYLES
Miniature raps get waxed, simonized
Into the fifth dimension of your centrifugal never typical stand attention
I'm, mystical rip shit til the power blows (BLOWS!)
Those chose to compete we delete em, observe defeat!
That's sendin' down from above to GET CHA, HIT CHA, split cha ditch cha
Picture you, victorious
I'm gory plus your shit's mad boring
Bring it on

[Chorus]
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
