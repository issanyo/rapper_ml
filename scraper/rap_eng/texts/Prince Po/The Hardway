[Verse 1: Godfather]
It was all a dream, I used to watch Big on the screen
And write rhymes puffing the green, now why me?
Now it's like steam, who got it? That's who gon' get it
Either with the clips or the snitches
Spade razor style, shit was so suspicious
That's why I get with the kid, sorta vicious
Just on some rap shit, I'm on stitches
And that means I'm not in the mood to score bitches
And cut 'em from the pack when they fucking up the stack
In fact, right now I'm like ''fuck 'em'' on the track
It wasn't all that, the whole nine
That's how I hold mine to add the fuck on to this gold mine
Rappers get a cold nine or ten 'til they never rhyme again
And it's a matter of time 'til I send this death threat lyrically
But remember, you really didn't hear it from me
Mans to be, no one
I'm the last nigga alive to show them
Precisely how a flow done
All done, from way back, I can say that
I been here laying this shit since the payback

[Hook: Godfather]
When they call me it's just for demolition strictly
I'm the guy to get, the guy who spit sickly
Forget me, what about y'all? Rented stars
Spitting wack bars like you hard, linen God
I'm not much mentioning y'all when I'm in charge
Plus I can charge when I want like the gods
Cock niggas who rhyme, watch niggas who shine
Just put the hot in your chest like a few lines

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Ayo, shit is realistic, anarchy, punk rock style
Call me ''shit vicious'', ignorant shit, I dig that shit
Going stupid, special ED student
To this industry I'm a nuisance
The dirtiest, we go through with Long Island thug kids
Don't know how to act
White boys that think they're black
We sneaking up behind you, watch out
You can hear the music in the background
When we 'bout to pop out we in the vehicle
Hop out with the crowbar, oh pa
Old school, snatch you out your car
We drive up the block to the spot where the hoes are
Pick up my little brother, Johnny Omar
We care about shit still, Rugged Man, still hated
Mr. Kubrick, say my name, bitch
Y'all know what my name is, The R. Rugged A
The Godfather Don in he motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prince Po]
I got a pitbull attitude, a pitbull bite
Shit, full of fire like that ass right
Shine without a flashlight, getting my cash right
Don, remember last night?
Niggas tried to rob us, dropped the glass pipe
Blow, Prince keeps his gats tight, niggas is strife
Shit on their own, they won't contribute to their own fast life
For real, nigga, shit been hectic
I only make moves that proves to be effective
Stash tight for close ones who decide to fake jacks
Trust the loyalty, older than 8 tracks
A soldier that'll break backs
Not entirely surely, easier than most speed
Pull on some more weed
High enough to see you shook from all the snitching
A small time crook who met with cops in the kitchen
As the plot starts to thicken we treat lower
Even my girl bust a nine, I had to show her

[Hook]
