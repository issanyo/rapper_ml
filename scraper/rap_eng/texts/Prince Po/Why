So why you trying to play me though?
Out like a sucker (Repeat 4x)

[Pharoahe Monch]
You're sneaking around like a sneaker baby, what's the beeper for?
Used to do my chores, now you're acting like a whore
Phones at my crib with you off to the store
For now, you don't love me no more?
Hey, by the way who's Kirk?
Left a message on my machine said you didn't come to work
You're AWOL from the job, plus who's Rob?
The way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing 'em
Sometimes I swear I think I feel like robbing 'em
But my papa told me never to snuff no girls
You give 'em diamonds, jewels, furs, pearls
Rings and shoes and cars and things
From time to time I wanna diss her
You couldn't blame me if I treat her like Amy Fisher
And dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo
You know, something like Joe Buttafuoco
But deep inside my heart, the pain still stings
When I think back and remember I was gonna swing her a ring
For her ring finger, yes I used to bang her
Like "inga binga bunga" but I'm out like Felix Unger so uh...

I reminisce back when I was swinging with Miss Pretty Young Thing
She got a kick outta my jeep and a meal at Burger King
I shot her ego down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security, uh
She just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young chick on a ego trip
Whip ping ha ha I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the Uptown set
We used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my darling til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretending then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off so to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet
Itchbay didn't know which way she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a dem bow, dem bow, dem bow, dem bow
You can't front, you used to bust all over Prince Po
And fall fast asleep into the morn
Girlfriend started flipping, so yo Prince had to be gone
I'm just another brother trying to get around the fakes
And keep my mental state, no matter what it takes and yo...
