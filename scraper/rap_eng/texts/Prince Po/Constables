[Verse 1: O.C.]
I’ll make wax, I’ll pay tax, I don’t sell crack
Accept the kickbacks, you’re called up on dispatch
The deal you done did with a dealer, you done dissed him
Took letters from his box, now he’s buried in the system
You see me coming out of my building all types
Of days and nights, wondering if I got a nine to five
Clothes are always knew, so you cry, I spy
A flashing ghost smile, you’re in the corner of my eye
Walking, I feel the hawk over right beside me.  Sober
But I act nervous and start to walk lively
Sharp-left from Rock, then I start to jog, hearing
Speed accelerating from the J8’s car
The sirens sound violent, they inspect more
Not ready, I’m on the stoop with my man named Little Eddy
We start laughing ‘cause next-door from me is a house
That has traffic like drugs are free, but I’m a
New face in a new place of a melon race
Guess black in ‘em makes a good felon case, and that’s
Not so, and I get mad ‘cause everywhere I go
Long as I’m dark, rocking Clarks in my village, though
Police be clocking me

[Verse 2: O.C.]
They’re clocking, jocking, and knocking me, wanting a reason for whacking me
But I ain’t committing no crime.  Soon as they’re stopping me
O.C. rolling for dolo, a solo cop car comes
Screeching in my presence, in a second, yelling, “Freeze!”
I’m scared, I cannot stop, hop over a fence, running
Frantic, sending O.C. into a panic
I ‘fuse to be Rodney hardly, you won’t scar me
Beating me down, yelling, smelling of old and coffee cinder
Fucking hard, but soft to a stick
Some cops are cool and some are just downright dicks
You won’t asphyxiate me in a chokehold, death mocking me
So for that, eat my dust and keep clocking me
Check the speedometer, check how I’m flashing
Nightsticks, and you don’t have the same type of fashion
Two blocks behind me, two jakes, and one blue, one
White.  Pair of Glocks equals 32 shots?  I
Think not

[Verse 3: O.C.]
What for?!?  Is it
My b-boy presence mixed with mature?
Is it the stone in me, comb the city in a
Benz?  Legitimate plus without ends
Paperwork was right, but sat us at a red light
Giving dirty looks, I guess assuming we were crooks
Scoping the car, tags up to par, rims
Shining in your face with the tires Armor-Alled, and them
Dig it.  All youngins my complexion have been through, getting
Stress, so I know you understand what I manifest
And Flannery, O’Toole, Vasquez, and black cop
Jones, all crooked with fat rides and homes
Watch your own PD, put an APB on your sergeant
Corrupt cash, careers skating on the margin
Next time, read me my rights, check out the snipes, look
Behind you on the wall, sucker.  I rocks mics, you dumb jakes
