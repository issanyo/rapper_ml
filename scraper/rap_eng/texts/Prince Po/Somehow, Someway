[Hook: Pharoahe Monch & Prince Poetry]
Somehow, someway
We be coming up wit funky fly shit
Like every single day, but uhh

[Verse 1:Prince Poetry]
Check it
Intelligent words, is colors inside of this rap vision
Liquidized for precision which cleanses'em like baptism
I bless souls through the worlds’ second religion
From the left with angles to enlarge the prism
Prince Po, I, out of the south-side slums
Claiming spots around all these hypocritical tongues
Repeating the same topic, misleading a seeds optic
With two years outta da picture
I still rock it and rock well
Don't ever let my stiggy get you gel (what?)
I strictly international ghetto, clientele
The freaky black James Bond, with infrared views inject propelling
Once examine, my steps, and with the few
I make power-u's, drop jewels inside of the groups
Inside of under the eyes of God, can't lose
Batter and bruise crews
And let the heat spark, the fuels
Got your boys crying while you're stretched out in front of da church pews
Fools hit the dance floor, to shake shoes
Intergalactic hip hop monster who sucks ooze
Out of the power that I used that to start the party
Want more?
Icky sticky butt naked and raw

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Only inches beyond my eyes, lord here lies the soul
Of a nigga who fights the lyrical war with inside himself
Pharoahe, eager to see feeble intermediate MCs
Immediately, deleted repeatedly
Y'all know the unpresidented without herb
Every single word'll be verbally demented
Presented, so that when it disintegrates
No sentiments, I’m imminent
Standin' alone and get your tenement
Isn't it bug how I bust lyrical slugs
At thugs that mug niggas for loot and sell drugs
When the band gets struck by feces
I'm only rollin' wit da most superior profile to my species
See my thesis to release these bombs by all means
Yes, attack the mic raps until it's a crack fiend
Mase the bass with AIDS and misplaced the vaccine
Pharoahe's pullin’ out on the Pope [Run it!]
To compare Catholicism with scriptures that I wrote and know
My physical form is like 'Nam, insane like Saddam Hussein but still calm, but uhh

[Hook]
