(Prince Po)

For the love of Christ
I don't need ice to leave you froze
Turn your brains to toothpaste
And squeeze till it blows
Grimm Reaper with rap flows
Raps a trap, (?) attack
Those who lack respect get heads cracked
Survive with the movement
Mad as domestic abusing
Extortion, Organized Konfusion
Teenage abortion, tossed and forced into prostitution
9/11 distorted the law's proportion

We was one unit, now we back to being monkeys in mosh pits
Drama (?), soon as the dark sits
Spark the (?)
Rotty-doddy aside
The Maserati, dog, respect the art
Black Max with smarts
The special effects that light up your heart
Me on the mic is like the bite of a shark
Ignite, and drive ya' bullshit
Right up the charts
Out of the hood and (?)
Still, gotta stay sharp

Remarkable with this modern day art
(?) soldier from Rosewood
Vanilla dutch, touch that's so hood
Blaze like blueberry haze
You know how we do in these last days
Smash (?) and raps for (?)
For them, it's Poe(?)
Spitting that 89 crack flow
(?)
Bounce out the back do'
But not without his gat, tho'
Danger Mouse came with that
Bent back, the big rim track
Get back Poe

(DOOM)
Hmm..
Is that so?
The first hip hop chat show
Whoever talk slick get they lipped popped
Like Fatso
Bum, feel the sting linger
Wrote this humdinger with a
Dislocated bling finger
Still king of the hill, it's the DOOM-Hour
When he came to spit more gibberish
Than Boomhauer, mayne
Wigs'll bleed with the quick speed
Drag 'em backstage
Like the tiger nigga did Siegfried

Caught a deal an a sawed off, (?)
Bought off, suit and shells (?)
And a hood shit
Just to ward off the groupie-males
Most will boast that his flows is coastal
I hope he get on the mic and don't go postal
But keep it blissful
It's wishful thinking
Piss full of drinking, fist full of Lincolns
Pistol full of lead with one in the head
And a fan base that spread from the unborn to undead

Done said, terror alert high
Dress code when it's stress mode, its shirt and tie
A certain guy told her to ignore the mask
A flirt in a skirt to make you beg for the ass
Baby got back, maybe got black
In a stranger house, Danger Mouse
Gave 'em hot tracks
Asked him could he bark on the beat
And spark Cali
Villain not the cat you wanna meet
In a dark alley
