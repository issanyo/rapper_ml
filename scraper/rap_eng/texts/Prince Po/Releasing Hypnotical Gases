[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
As you look from henceforth I come
Riding the wind thus eliminating
Competition from bird's-eye view, I'm
Descending in helicopters in a village raid
Flesh will burn when exposed to the poetical germ grenade
I'm highly intoxicating
Your mind, when I'm operating
On cell walls to membranes, cytoplasms to protoplasms
Disintegrate 'em eliminate 'em now no one has em
In battle I display a nuclear ray that'll
Destroy bone marrow in cattle
Thereby destroying the entire food supply
That's crawling with AIDS, maggots, flies
It's ironic when a demonic government
Utilizes bionics and a six million dollar man
To capture me: clever, however
You could never ever begin to apprehend a hologram
Who's determined to fight solely
To defend in wars a land of the holy
I threw a rock and I ran
'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the depths of the sand
So don't ask me who's sane
'Cause the hypnotical gases are eating my brain

[Sample]
Oxygen levels... check it
Hydrogen levels... check it
Nitrogen levels... check it

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
Twenty-thousand leagues down below
Minus one-hundred and forty three degrees
Seize the info, gather the archaelogists
The aftermath needs to follow this 'cause it's
Deep, equivalent to the esophagus
Spreads to scientists, a.k.a. Optimus Prime
Time, television is dead
On this issue and very much irrelevant to this intuition
Deleting any alias info and descriptive
Mortal calm, partition with infrared light - vision
Precision, beams, colors, reds, fuschias, lime-greens
Black, don't you know my formulas form dope lyrics
Uplift spirits and yo I hear it's
Fatal to walk the path of Konfusion where it's
Torture some cherish while most human-like beings perish
Subjected to death
Their bodies don't agree with the hypnotical intellect
Poetical acid is burning up flesh
At the end of corridor you see me sitting there, Johnny More Grotesque
Literature somewhat equivalent
To concentrated sodium hypochlorite
Insight, foresight, more sight
The clock on the wall reads a quarter past midnight
You feel nauseous
Forever you will avoid my royal presence as I step into darkness

[Sample]
Now is the time...to stretch your brain to it's maximum

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
I am one who is one with all things
Thus the unorthodox I am
The paradox I am
The equinox extending my hand into dimensions
To unlock new doorways
And so the light has revealed to me that there must be more ways
And so I play with rhythms for something more than a mere game
Enabling me to advance in wisdom
Words will exist like vampires
No need for sunlight
From concentration camps I escape with my sanity
In 2010 every man will be subject to global warming
Formless oval, millions of locusts swarming
Seek and you shall find the deliverer of a rhyme
The intelligent one utilizing the mind
Third vision, surrounded by a three-sided figure
Containing the brain, the triggering mechanism from which I strike
Sight beyond sight, sound beyond sound
Which comes from below the magma, the granite, the ground
The surface will seperate dispersing harmful ashes
Your optics will not be able to detect the deadly hypnotical gases
Damn it's hard to breathe
But if I got one breath left
I'll suck wind from the valley of death
Here I come from the slums of earth to center
I reveal myself as a beast within a
Unbreakable shell, walking through
The doorways of Heaven - or is this Hell?

[Sample]
The time is now... right now
This is the hour! This is the new dawn!
This is the new day

[Verse 4: Prince Poetry]
As I step into the thunderdome with flows as the wind blows
Visualize the intros
Releasing hypnotical gases, chemicals mixed, fixed
Taking it to the sixth round of poetical warfare
Energetically I walk with the flare
Rampaging like a rock-like figure
Throughout the night's atmosphere I swear
My wrist holds mind-trigger, darkness can't overshadow me
'Cause of high rate of smashing you then trashing you
After I'm bashing you with my hammer
Whenceforth passed to me by Odin
Occasionally my profile is low-key, gamma
Rays brainwashed to transforms me
But I still withhold my hammer to lift me up
For God still is my uplifter
I use this knowledge just to crush the cluster of Grifter
Night approaches so I proceed in flight
Back to the Hall of Justice as I continue to disintegrate 'em
Translating the codes in hypnotical language
Then a Theta assault stepping up
Frontin' to be quite blunt a radical creator of a
Poetical, hypothetical, mathematical slang slur
Punch that stuns and amazes and dazes
And phases the stages with pages of the lost chapters
Unfound factors
So I stretch like Reed Richards across the land
Continue with reading your equilibrium
With concepts that confuse ya, metabolism's fallin' off
Data consider oblivion
Now as I walk through the valley of death
Ignoring the battle lashes and gashes and rashes
The atom smashes, 'cause I released the last hypnotical gases
