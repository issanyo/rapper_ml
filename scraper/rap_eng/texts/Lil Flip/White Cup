That's where my weapon at
Come get it, you want it, you know I got my heat on me

I gotta get my bling on
A million buzz plus before I put my ring on
Before my ringtones
I was gettin' my green on
I told Flip pour me a four to get my lean on
Pass me that Sunkist

One hand on woodgrain the other on that white cup

When we say we got a money cup
That mean we poured up a strong... soda
You dig what I'm sayin'?
