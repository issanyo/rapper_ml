[Talking]
Just another day in the hood
Chillin with my niggas, ya know
Right now we shoot a documentary for my mothafuckin album
Bringin y'all niggas straight to the hood, come on walk with me

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
Nigga I can hit you from a block away
Cause my chopper bang like a beat from Dr.Dre
I'm creepin at night with a Ki of that white
From 8'O clock till 5, come get what you like
From Vicodin to X pills you know who got the best deal
I guarantee you fuckers this'll be my best year
Canary stones got me lookin like a night light
I ain't racist when it comes to diamonds cause I like white
My bezzel lookin like it ain't even paid for
But that's a lie bitch I got real paper
I'm from the ghetto, the gudda where the feds hang
I'm with ya wife fuckin up ya bed frame
You ridin, I'm ridin-time to grab the weapons
The shell catchers, gloves, and them teflons
Cause when it's war anything goes
I'm a stand up nigga, nah I ain't a hoe

[Chorus - Lil' Flip]
I'm from da hood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
I wish you would-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
Let's get it understood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
I got choppers made of wood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
I'm from da hood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
I wish you would-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
Let's get it understood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda
I got choppers made of wood-da gudda, da, da, da gudda

[Verse 2 - Lil' Flip]
Ay alot of niggas hatin on me cause of the jewels I got
So just face reality homie you ain't hot
I read ya little interviews you don't know when to quit
No matter how good you do niggas gon'talk shit
I got bitches on my team that'll rob you nigga
Right after she give you head and massage you nigga
I play the game like a pro when it come to the streets
And the bump'll make you leak when it come to the beef...ca'peesh
Look, listen when I talk cause I'm a general
I hope ya OG's smart enough to let you know
I'm the truth in the booth what I rap about I did it
I told Johnny put thirty pointers in my fitted
I get it, I got it I'm makin a profit
My kitted Impala watch me hop it
I'm hittin switches on the bitches when I drive by
I'm knockin snitches in ditches when I do drive bys

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Look if you wanna get paid, get that money nigga
If you wanna ride blades, get that money nigga
If you wanna Escalade, get that money nigga
Yeah bitch I got it made, get that money nigga(oh boy)

[Verse 3 - Lil' Flip]
Look it's one for the money, two for the show
Three gigs for eight five now I need my dough
Look I'm straight off the block where the fiends be geekin
I know a cat who snort three O's every weekend
Lawyers, and doctors hide behind they occupations
Cause at the first of the month they be waiting
Shiiit I take food stamps and all that shit
And if that ain't a hustle what you call that then(chump)
I'm a young ass nigga with alot of game
I floss hard cause everyday I rock a different chain
I think my hood and my niggas who hold me down
Besides Lil'J, Lil' Flip control the town(*echoes*)

[Chorus]
