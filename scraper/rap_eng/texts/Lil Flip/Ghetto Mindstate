[Talking - Lyfe Singing Over Flip talking]
WOOOO...new shit, Lil' Flip and Lyfe
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)-talk to 'em Lyfe
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)-talk to 'em Lyfe
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)-Yea

[Hook - Lyfe]
I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't (you just what?)-I just can't get away
I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't (you just what?)-I just can't get away

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
Ay at fifteen I was makin moves
Drinkin beer-shootin dice at school(Yea)
When most niggas had a nine to five shiiit(fuck that shit)
On the block we makin nine to five grand
Each day, yeah we got cheap yay
My niggas on lock they call me on three way(hello)
The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cuttin yards for a twenty piece of crack rock
Around my way ain't nobody watchin Matlock
We tryna hot wire cars, and break pad locks
Turn soft to hard drop it in Gladlock's
And drive flashy cars and get mad props and still I want change
Last week they caught my partner with a block of caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him 83 years his mama went insane (Damn)

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lil' Flip]
Comin up with no father figure
I guess that made me a harder nigga(why)
Cause I don't like to ask for shit
When I came in the game with a half a brick(yes)
But I ain't telling little kids to go that route
But it's on TV everyday like they don't know that route
And little girls bein fast, bein grown tryna flirt
Leavin home wearin pants, then change into a skirt
I live in the ghetto, I stay in the ghetto
Run up wrong I'm sprayin that metal
Cause ain't shit sweet around my way
All I know is one thing, how to get paid
With Lyfe on the hook I know we got another hit
This motivational music I know you feelin this
Ay and I was raised in the church
But where I'm from you gotta move that work

[Hook]

[Flip]
Why everybody tryna bring me down
Because of me they respect H-Town
Look I was here when y'all wasn't around
The first week you did aight but then that shit went down

Why everybody tryna bring me down
Because of me they respect H-Town
Look I was here when y'all wasn't around
The first week you did aight but then that shit went down

[Lyfe]
They tell you, you was born to die
Yo'mama she was born to cry
Yo'woman she was born to lie
Hold you down so you can't feel life
I tell you that it's all a lie
Young nigga you just gotta try
Keep your eyes up on the sky
Don't let ya dreams pass you by...cause somebody said
