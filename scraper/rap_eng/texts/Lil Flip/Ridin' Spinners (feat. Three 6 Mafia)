(feat. Three 6 Mafia)

(DJ Paul)
This for all my players out there ridin'... spinners
I don't care where you at, the club parking lot
The express way, whatever
What I want you to do right now is just STOP
And let em' keep spinnin' baby

(Hook 2X)
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
They don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners
I'm rolin'

(DJ Paul)
Pedal to the metal then STOP, (*Brakes*)
Take another sip from the syrup then STOP (*Brakes*)
Let my seat back, drop the top then STOP (*Brakes*)
See me something sexy, spot that ass I gotta STOP (*Brakes*)
My rims so shiny they clear like flat-screen plasma
Gals break when they see em' it's hard to breathe like they got asthma
Older people trippin' cause they think they seein' thangs
My car sittin' still but my rims still rolin' man, they off the chain

(Juicy J)
Everybody let ya spinwheels spin like a spinmill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville
See them thangs shinin' sparkin' like a diamond
Bumpin' the Alpi-ne, why you's a lyin'
Eyes like a Chinese, I'm drinkin' on the Heiny
I'm ridin' on the strip, any party you can find me
You rollin' with the finest, the North Memphis highness
You ball till ya fall, till a player aged ninety

(Hook 2X)
(Lil' Flip)
I got twenty inch spinners on my drop (*Brakes*)
Nothin' but white and yellow rocks in my watch (*Brakes*)
I'm doin' one-fifty so I'm watchin' for the cops (*Brakes*)
Since I'm in the Lamborghini I ain't gon' stop (*Brakes*)
I'm packin' a Glock believe it or not I'm ready to bust
And down here we drink purple (And we drink that Tuss)
So grab a cup Juice so I can pour ir up
And if you represent yo hood, go on throw it up
It's the L-I-L F-L-I-P
If I ain't smokin' trees, I'm pokin' freaks
So throw the row of keys and let me roll
Cause this the way we ball, I'm just lettin' you know
We like our music slow but our cars go faster
I'm in the V-12 with my cousin Big Shasta
I'm Lil' Flipper and I'm a top ten seller
Everybody slowin' down cause my drop is yellow

(Hook 2X)
(Lord Infamous)
I saw my dog with the center circles so I (*Brakes*)
They spinnin' like a saw so don't touch em' when I (*Brakes*)
I saw a shanky broad that owe me money so I (*Brakes*)
See me choke the hell up out my broad when I (*Brakes*)
When ya stand by the blades you can feel a slight breeze
Stop by House of Dubs just to keep em' on clean
Fell up in the Peabody, the most expensive suite
Them thangs still spinnin' when I filled out the receipt

(Crunchy Black)
I used to be clean in my Expedition
A girl see me and she'll be wishin'
That I'd stop and spit some pimpin'
It's mackin' in me baby, I just thought I would mention
She got hot like in the kitchen
You see my kin folks, cars, and glisten
Ain't nothin' like Sprewells cause they spinnin'
It's CB baby I'm just in it to win it

(Hook 2X)
