(talking)
Yeah I represent Houston man
Ya know they say we country down here
But everybody tryna ride blades
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Ya feel me?, so I'm just keepin it trill
Like my nigga Bun B say, yeah ugh ugh

(Lil' Flip)
I came along way I went from Cutless to Benz
From Benz to Jag on twenty-three inch rims
From crack to macs from broke to sacks
From water guns, to bee-bees, from bee-bees to gats
From stamps to tatoos from home to school
Even though I made straight A's I still broke the rules
I came along way I went from no shows, to mo'shows
I went from Duck Head, to Girbaud, and Polo
They all said ("Flip you need to stop rapping")
And now I'm rockin 2 chains they say please stop cappin
And I'm like what happened?I thought we was cool
But I gotta strong line so I'm like fuck you!

(Chorus rp2x)
They always said I was a country boy(country boy)
But now they see the rims spinnin on my candy toy(toy)
They always said I was a country boy(country boy)
Well look at me now bitch I'm a star(star)

(Lil' Flip)
Well I'm a supa dupa star in a supa dupa car
Got 9 DVDs I'm watching the Entourage
Nextel, Cellular(hello)windows tinted
I payed for my ride your Benzo rinted
I'm all weed scented cause I blow like Snoop
And people think I'm flippin birds
Cause I'm rollin in a Coupe
And I'm smellin like Juice wit 20 rocks on my tooth
Ya'll doing the Harlem Shake we raise da roof
I sprayed the Coupe with ten coats of red
And just because blades are choppin everybody dead
And I'm like the Exorcist cause I gotta turn a head
And we can't go on a date girl if you in the (?red?)
Cause I'll hit you in the head wit a mothafuckin pillow
I'ma stay Sucka Free like my homie Big Mello(R.I.P)
And thats coming straight from me
And I'm still a ghetto boy like Scarface and MJB

(chorus)

(Lil' Flip)
I ain't ashamed of where I'm from baby I'm from the hood
And if you ask me how I'm doin"I'ma say I'm doin good"
And I wish you would pull out a gat and try to jack
Cause I'm a do you like a egg nigga you gettin cracked
I ain't ashamed of where I'm from baby I'm from the hood
If people ask me how I'm doin"I'ma say I'm doin good"
And I wish you would pull out a gat and try to jack
Cause I'm a do you like a egg nigga you gettin cracked

(talking)
All my ex's live in Texas haha
Yeah Redd in a Lexus nigga thats how we doin it
