You smell that? Hey, that's the money
I smell money, Ross
I know y'all wonderin' like
"What the hell is Flip doin' man
How he get out his deal?"
All you gotta do is take two million and walk in the door
And that's how they'll let you go 'cause I get money, n***
I'm a fly boy, n***, my chain worth thousand grands, n***
That's twenty thousand karats, n***, step your game up
That's why your chain ain't up, n***
The blue barb on my lap when I'm in the trap hood
Blueberry by the pound, now where did you get that?
I can't tell you, n***, I'm not a snitch
But on the real it feel great to be rich
I'm just playin' my hand, watchin' 'Makin' The Band'
Johnny ordered my watch and he makin' the band
I be changin' it up, ain't no changin' me what
You, lil' n***, better shut up, shut up
Aye, who shut the mall down? Me
And who bought all the hats? Me
Matter of fact, don't I look good in this Cadillac?
My roof back, my coupe black, fifty grand, I blew that
I'm so fly, they call me Mr. I Can Do Dat 'cause
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
My car a Benz, not a regular Benz
Multi millionaire so, baby, I double my ends
Mercedes, Maybach, broke, n***, stay back
The boss don't play that, boy, you gotta pay that
Watch cop some bub, G's runnin' stacks
They be year off, bring my money back
Yeah, I f*** wit' G's out in Cloverland
We talkin' twenty keys but I don't know the man
I'm gettin' cheese, it's time to shine
I love to flip, I'm flippin' mine
I love the smell, they smell the money
You wanna smell yourself, well, b***, shell it from me
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
I told n***, I show n***, I'm the best
I'm the s*** in New York, but I'm a god on the West
I must confess, 'The Source' own me two more mics
I took my ringtone money and bought two more bikes
I took my liquor money and bought another crib
I got three maids that is that f*** game
Go ask Corn Row, we do it big right?
If I ain't front row I ain't watchin' the fight
I be in Street Port wit' my n***, Bayday
I be in airports wit' my f*** AK
Four seven to eleven, one eight seven on a cop
I know you prayin' that I flop, n***, but
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get, I get, I get money
I get money and that's how it is
