[Big T.]
Ladda la la la la la la
Ladda la la la la la la
I just got to be T, thats all I can be
So man I'm puttin it down in this damn industry
For my peeps and my fam, so here I am
Live tryna to slide for the wide body ride
I can't high side, cause that ain't never been me
And ain't gone never be me and now its plain to see
Ain't no trippin with T, I'm still blowin' on tree, with them boys out the Woss Ness, Lil' Head and Big Bee
Chop shop on a beat Rebel, Worm and T
Sippin' on fours and we riding on threes
I must confess cause we're some of the best
Know gone give us our card and you can keep the plex
We're holdin' it down, from the South to the North, the East or the West and we ain't settlin' for less
Now chunk it up, for the whole Southside ladda la la la la la

(Chorus 1)
Big T, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
Lil' Flip, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
South World y'all, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
In House,in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la

[Lil'Flip]
Now when you see me on the streets, I'm smokin sweets
And I always keep a bad broad close to me
Long hair yella bone wit a college degree
I see Big T number on my caller I.D
He say we gotta do a show, at the bayou classic
If you can't see we ballin', then you need glasses
I'm million dollar star that's how I carry  myself
Can't no girl brake my heart, cause I'm marry myself
I represent the South side of Houston, Texas
I can't drive a Acura, cause I'm used to Lexus
Have you ever seen a watch wit big ol' princess
I live in a condo, wit big ol' fences
And every time I drop a song, I'm showin my spine
All I need is a 8, to go wit my pint
I'm the coldest rap star that you ever saw
Platinum got me lookin' like I gotta metal jaw, what

(Chorus 2)
Big T, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
Lil' Flip, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
South World y'all, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
In House,in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la

[Big T]
Now as time goes on, I'm still puttin' it down
Some things have changed, a million dollars latter now
Big T, what you gonna do
I'm gonna gather up my people and we gon' act a fool
I thought you knew and I ain't gon' even trip
I gotta stay on my game so I want even slip
And that's fo sho, I'm here ta let ya know, I'm a platinum playa now its time ta show
Dear Momma do all appreciate, you taught ya boy T to never ever ever playa hate
For what a brother got or what another brother do
You taught me how to stay down and be true
So that's what I'ma do, stay down and be true
You know the game over no mo' ride hoodu
Big ol' pretty houses and them big ol' foreign cars
I done did it, I must admit I'ma star

(Chorus 3)
Big T, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
Lil' Flip, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
South World y'all, in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
In House,in the house tonight
Ladda la la la la la
