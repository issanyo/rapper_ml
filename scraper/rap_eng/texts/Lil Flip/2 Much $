[Intro (Big Tiger)]
We got that green stuff
Big Tike
Lil Flip the Leprechaun
Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Finna put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new 'lac and put it on chrome without touchin' my stash
Like Lil Flip, I can do dat
Excursion, candy blue that
22 that
Pound of dro, I done blew that
You shoulda knew that
The Slim Thug gon' shine
My earrings cost a dime
I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line
You can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth than The Boss
Open yo' mouth up, you lost
I'm blindin' these boys
I'm chewin' on rocks
Hittin' your blocks in candy blue toys
Talkin' noise
Cuz I a'int old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash stash than yo' daddy in the bank
I'm top rank
Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk
We can bet vault for vault
We some paid young G's with too much cash
Too much flow and dough talkin' too much trash

[Hook (Big Tiger & Slim Thug) x4]
We got too much money
Too much cash
All y'all haters can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got
Like Scarface I Rap-A-Lot
It's [?] straight off the lot
Believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swangin' 4's and [?] throwed
Bangin' hoes and changin' clothes
Smokin' dro and doin' shows
Paper stackin' never [?]
I bought the car, I bought the house
I represent the dirty south
I got more syrup than Waffle House
I run through hoes like marching [?]
I talk the talk, and walk the walk
Cuz nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be
I know yo' gal know me
Cuz I wear a rolly that look like a snowman
And I [?] a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sittin' on dubs kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, a'int none of them fake
Give me a break
You think I'm lyin' in the summer
I'm at the mall with your ho, and she buyin' me something
I'm a young pimp
With a whole lotta cash
And all y'all haters y'all can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Big Tiger]
I got too much M-O, N-E-Y
Anything I S-E-E, I B-U-Y
Pulled a Bentley off the lot and ran that thang in'o the wall
We throw [?] in the [?] and watch it fall
Watch me ball
As the dubs spin like a top
I got crunk when I stop and made my pop trunk wop
Gals bop
Automatic, cuz I'm top of the line
[?]
I'mma shine
Suca Free, Boss Hogg and the [?]
You can catch me fresh and braided
Or rugged and throwed
You see the sprees on the car [?] rock
When girls see Tike flippin' [?] they say (urrrrrrrrr) and pull they cameras out
Damn I'm hot when I hit the club I'm [?] the line to the bar
And for the first hundred people [?] they car
Attracting yo star
Cuz shes lookin' at my piece attractin' yo car
We got too much green and that's real by far

[Hook]
