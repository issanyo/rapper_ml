I stay lit, I talk shit, and back it up
'Cuz I'm a balla, my money, you can't match it up

(Chorus)
Lil' Flip, Flip, Flip
I like to flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips
I like to flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips, flip my chips
'Cuz I'ma, I'ma balla
I'ma, I'ma balla
I'ma ba.., I'ma ba..., I'ma, I'ma balla
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma balla
I'ma, I'ma balla
I'ma ba..., I'ma ba..., I'ma, I'ma balla

(etc.)

Hey, I gotta big chain, big name, black watch, blue range
In my concerts, we 50 deep like Wu-Tang
Drop top with hella screens, platinum grill, yellow ring
Get a mil, split a mil
Break it down with my team
Every pistol got a beam

Every nigga got a scheme
'Cuz every empire got a star with a dream
We makin' green, puffin' green, drinkin' lean
We digital scales, no more triple beams

(Chorus w/ liberties)
Hey, I got the Clover G watch, Clover G shirt
Lucky Nike's liquor, clover girl shirts
Mack 10 loaded
I stay focused
I'm worldwide, ya'll niggas local
Plaques on my wall, rims on my car, Louie 13 all in my bar
I got loot, 0-6 coupes, press one button, the roof went poof
(Hey) you know Lil' Flip go Platinum everytime
I like money so I stay on the grind
I'm doin' fine, I took a break, now I'm back
I do you like a magazine, you'll get smacked

{Chorus w/ liberties)
