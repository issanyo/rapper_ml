This what I want you to do
I want you to go to the bar
Go buy the most expensive drink
And pour it on a nigga you don't like

Yeah, we ain't come here to rock the crowd
Nigga, we came here to start a fuckin' fight, bitch
You know how we do it

We came to get it crunk, we came to get drunk
We came to chill in VIP and smoke a couple of blunts
Pull a couple of dimes, spit a couple of rhymes
And if niggas jump fly I got a couple of nines

I'm ahead of my time 'cause I stay on my grind
'Cause most niggas be lettin' hoes play with they mind
But not me cause homey don't play that
You see me with a strap, homey gon' 'spray that shit

Where ya face at, you talkin' now take that
You talkin' out the side of ya neck, don't make me break that
Slap you, slap him, clap you, clap him
'Cause I ain't got time for all that wrestling

I'm just a cool dude when I'm in a good mood
But when I'm pissed off, my attitude is fuck you
I'm like a tattoo, I never go away
That's why I ride with a tech and the throw-away

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke weed like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah

Throw yo hood up nigga and tear the club up
While I'm in the parking lot, tryna tear my dubs up
I'm Cadillac pimpin' like the Young Bloodz
So come to Texas and smoke the best Bud nigga

I got what you want, I got what you need
And can't nobody throw a party like me
So quit ya frontin' and quit ya cappin'
See that's why you small cats never flip to platinum

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke weed like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all get money like we get money
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah

All my niggas and my bitches
Throw yo' hood in the mothafuckin' air, throw it up
And if y'all smoke weed like we smoke weed
Let me hear y'all scream, oh yeah
