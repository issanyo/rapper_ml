[Hook 1] - Lil' Flip (Big James)
You on point James (I'm on point Flip)
You act bad James (I act bad Flip)
You got skills (Nigga you know I got skills)
Then lets put our brains together and make some meals

(Lil' James)
I got skills like a coal mine lined up with a drill
Keep the crowd on their feet like Vince Carter wind mills
I'm from the heart of the streets it ain't no harder than me
You better throw in a towel you can't flow harder than me
If ain't sparkin up sweets I'm bogarting the beat
Then I'm in studios spittin flows dodging the heat
Game as hard as a creep mind harder to piece
It's so throwed you gon need tinted goggles to see
It's iced out
You think you can hang like Wayne its lights out
You think you can hang with Big James you might drop
You think you can grip with Lil' Flip you might ship
So don't slip we knocking tight like vice grip

[Hook 2] - Lil' James (Lil' Flip)
You on point Flip (I'm on point James)
You act bad Flip (I act bad James)
You got skills (Nigga you know I got skills)
Well lets put our brains together and make some meals

(Lil' Flip)
You know I got skills like Kevin Garnett
In my garage I got eleven Corvettes
I'm Lil' Flip and I'm the freestyle king
And I like to act bad did you peep my ring
And the heat I bring burn like acid
So step back cause I burn through plastic
I'm the hardest down south and niggas hate that
You claim you makin' cash you ain't drop a tape yet
I'm a CEO you know what that mean
Don't nobody touch my green
Some niggas can't rap some niggas can't flow
But guess what Lil' Flip can do both

[Hook 2]

[Lil' Flip]
Well I'm a mic wrecker
A Lamborghini price checker
Rolex, baguettes, 30 pointer ice bezel

(Lil' James)
I'm a freestyle ace
Shining all in your face
The same gator on my shoes wrapped around my waist

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a track ripper
A black dob hat tipper
I step out at the Grammy's wearing black slippers

(Lil' James)
I'm a bin bibber
Orange juice and gin sipper
On this track I went first the hook and then Flipper

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a song writer
And I carry my own title
I copyright all of shit
So nigga don't bite her

(Lil' James)
I'm a fast flower
True naked ass shower
Endo optimal hydro hash blower

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a big shot
I'm the king of Hip Hop
And when I freestyle I leave you with your lips locked

(Lil' James)
I'm a mud puppy
Codeine cup guppy
I eat fish, shrimp, french fries with hush puppies

[Lil' Flip]
I'm in a Pathfinder
I'm autograph signer
And I'm gon be rich until I'm a flat liner

(Lil' James)
I'm a young thug ready
Nineteens on my Chevy
Breaking hoes like Eddie
More blades than Freddie

[Lil' Flip]
Now I'm a superstar
I know you heard of a star
We the ones that be driving them convertible cars

(Lil' James)
I'm a Sunny Side nigga out of Check-A-Ho Texas
I stay money wide nigga like a chief executive
