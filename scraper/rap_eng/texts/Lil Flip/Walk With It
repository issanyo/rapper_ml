[Intro: Jay Electronica]
I got eight bars to come in before I talk shit right? Yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
You know I had to do a bounce record
Come on, you know where I'm from?
I had to do a bounce record
Plus I'm going home next week
Falon, I see you

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
I'm from that UPT
I'm out that Third Ward where they bussin' heads
Moving, shaking, hustling, scrambling, bucking and ducking feds
The corners stay hot as saunas with blood rushing red
Down in the Dirty we bout it and we ain't fucking scared
I got em shook from the jump, cuz I'm a soldier these niggas is yellow
I told you I'm out that Magnolia, my nigga, foreal-a
On the grind all the time, load and stacking that scrilla
It's the South, man, we put the fucking "g" in gorilla
Uh, talk slick and get your neck slit quick
'Cuz Uptown niggas don't play that shit
And if you ready come get me, got a squad that's with me
That blow the beef outta control like Ja and 50
I'm the king, the daddy, you heard, the best around
Link up with Lil Flip man, we tear this bitch down
You know when them South boys is coming around
'Cuz all you gon' hear is, "Lay it down, lay it down"

[Hook: Jay Electronica]
Now walk, walk with it (X4)
Rock, rock with it (X4)
Shake, shake with it (X4)
Pop, pop with it (X4)

[Verse 2: Lil Flip]
A lot of rap cats rap about jewels
But that ain't rose gold, that fool's
Look at the shoes on the whip, 22's
I still got a deal, what about you?
I got liquor, nigga, you want a drink?
I go on shopping sprees, you want a mink?
I'm just kidding, I ain't tricking for a ho
This how I'm living, I ain't hurting for no dough
I push tight whips just like Percy
I always rock custom jerseys
My new shit about to drop on you niggas
Just call me ho, when you not with your nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
Now, here's a little story I got to tell
About a fresh young nigga you know so well
It started way back in history
In that Third Ward Magnolia, yeah UPT
I was born in seventy-six, and raised in the eighties
Pops left when I was six, I was raised by ladies
Son of Marilyn, brother of Fal
I grew up one block over from the South
T.I. told me, "Be Easy" but I'm hungry as fuck
I want a house on the hill and some pump in the truck
Now I'm up in the club player setting it off
With a mic in my palm tight letting it off
Shorty, smiling saying I'm spectacular
She wanna bite me on my neck like Dracula
She says she wanna show me something good after the show
Whatever ma, for now get your ass on the floor and

[Hook]
