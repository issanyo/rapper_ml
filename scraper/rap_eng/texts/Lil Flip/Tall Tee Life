Find me on Christian Mingle, looking like Ocho Cinco



My plug gave me them thangs I said adios my amigo

Prada Walkin' Los and I'm flooded up with them street clothes

Red monkeys 8X tall tee and my crispy foot ball cleets on

Grab my ice and my Mauris then I throw dat cold mink on



Bout to cash at Somerset then at Beni's go get my eat on

Somerset don't got FUBU and Beni's no Dolla menu

Needed a quarter for bus fare and I found it man I'm like blues Clues



Girl on Bebo asked me where I shop and I told her I shopped at 4 Men

But when I said 4 Men you know I really meant Formans

Akademiks jogging suit got me crispy at the performance

Lil Flip concert man I love to see him performing



Mc Chicken cost a dollar but ion got enough guala

Go no heat or water but I'm walking in Pradas

Stupid fruity chain man it's looking like guava

I'm 20 with 20 pair of Trues but I still stay with my mama



But how it is when you the man, I'll take your girl and spoil at Citi Trends

Ain't like me when I wasn't crispy but now she a fan

Blade dance in the layaway line cuz I just copped some pants

Man I love my life, you spilled sum'n on your tall tee you looking trife

Crispy 9x white tee cuz I live that life, crispy gas station tall tee man I love my life



We don't do that tight stuff in the D, we wearing talk tees

Sagging down to our knees with creased Girbaud jeans

Pants cuffed 12 times sitting on all white Nikes
S
He saw that I was fresher than you so she chose me



DDOT bus I'm catching 7 mile I'm repping

I'll kill you with onomopeias I don't use no weapons

Black Planet your girl some metaphors and she'll get pulled in seconds

You got six X's on that tall tee? Well boy I got 11

Learn some new words out the dictionary everyday

I'm in these all white Buffies screaming RIP Blade



Have you call the plug up like man I just can't pay, I Tried to flex on Los but he crispy everyday

He got 4 pair of Girbauds and he just copped some more

He went and bought all the long tees from the corner store

Walked from 7 mile to Somerset so I thought he was poor

But Prada Walkin' Los spent bands at the Aero store



Chingy in the speakers cuz I'm getting rich

I'm real smart so my sentence structure switch

Baby girl on my jock from the Phat Farm kicks

New Phat Farm 5 Jordan's you ain't een hip
