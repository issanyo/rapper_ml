[Verse]
Fuck with me and get some money
Yeah I fuck with King Johnny
100K, that's my ring money
And you ain’t gon' take a thing from me
Man, I'm from H-town
We start shootin’, you should lay down
You wouldn't wanna jump up
I lay rappers down when the pump up
Here is something I can't understand
I could just kill a man
On the east coast, man I fuck with Killa Cam
You want a verse, you better take yo' ass to MoneyGram
I love multiplyin', fuck subtractin' numbers
Email me the trackin' number
And I'ma send your verse back
I bodied it, I should send a hearse back
I’m back up in the booth again
Like Beanie Sigel, I gotta spit the truth again
I got the wraith, had to get the coupe again
Like Stockton, I could shoot again
Tell me where you want to go
I got some killers down in Mexico
They’ll meet you at the Texaco
Turn your body to a vegetable
Now you can't think, now you can’t move
I'm the king, dog, so I can't lose
Got hits like Babe Ruth
Kill shit like Rae Carruth
You ain't never seen me
In a cambo Lamborghini
All the cars I got, man, I paid for it
Take some from me, man we spray for it
You know I love to trap a lot
I’m from Houston, the same town as Rap-A-Lot
I took the cops on a car chase
At fifteen, I'm jammin' Geto Boys and Scarface
I think my mind playin' tricks on me
I think they tryin' to blend some bricks on me
Man I got hits homie
Scratch that, I got classics, [?]
BMI, that's TMI, too much information
This is dedication
I ain't never sold my soul, everything went gold
Then I went to platinum, I ain't cappin'
Still in the muhfuckin' booth with the rhymes
Sold a lot of work, never did a line
A legend like Morris Day and The Time
These rappers transform like Optimus Prime
I'ma stay the same
Got a smart brain, money'll never make me change
In the booth I go deranged, I get crazy
I ain't these other rappers, dog, I ain't lazy
I work for myself, build shirts for myself
You got beef, I squirt for myself
Take the K out the shelf, don't play about the wealth
Turn your favorite rapper into a patty melt
Flip 'em over, do it from the clover
Fourteen, pulled up in a Range Rover
I'll murk you before this shit change over
Made five million dollars off of Game Over
Made eight million dollars off of Sunshine
I'm from the south, I could freestyle and do a punchline
Man, I'll murder these rappers
Name one, man, I never heard of these rappers
This a freestyle, dog, I ain't write this
I'ma smoke a whole seven, that's a Mike Vick
I ain't never been a rookie but I smoke cookies
Gangsta in my hood just like Tookie
Want to see a dope show? You should book me
I turn your forehead into a pussy
When I pull out the Glock 9
I ain't stoppin', I don't even stop at stop signs
I'ma keep goin', got the codeine homie
I'ma keep pourin', money keep growin'
Chia Pet style, jet style
I got a cult, David Koresh style
I'm crazy, don't play me bitch
They worship me, they atheist
I'm a king, I'm a god with this freestyle
Used to put my weed in black and milds
I'm on some other shit, other other shit
Just like a orgy, you better find out who you fuckin' wit'
I show up to yo' motherfuckin' front do'
Take you on a chase like OJ in his bronco
Hey I'm on the news, paid a lot of dues
We make the rules, we don't play by the rules
I do what I want, move how I wanna
Sippin' syrup and blowin' that marijuana
Good shit, like Ace, I be on some hood shit
I'm from H-town, we be grippin' wood bitch
Oh I got a splinter, this wraith is mine nigga
This not a rental, I bite and scratch niggas
Just like a bengal, paint drippin' red
On it's menstrual, candy red shit
Excellent adventure, Bill and Ted shit
On my med shit, I got street cred bitch
I got shooters, shooters in every city
We smoke dutches and we smoke phillies
Smoke the cone, favorite rap group is Bone
And 8-Ball and MJG and Sweet Jones
And Bun B, if a rapper ever jump me
We gon' come back, turn it to 22 Jump Street
Everybody fucked up, double cups up
Shoot him in his guts, pull out the nunchucks, what the fuck
Here's a uppercut, I did songs with Young Buck
And I ain't never blow my money, I'm not a dumb fuck
I got songs with 50, I got songs with Game
I- I don't care where I'm at, I ain't tuckin' my chain
This that real shit, independence day like Will Smith
Who the dopest freestyler? You should say Lil Flip
I go to Pappadeaux when I want some shrimp
Like, space, my name was on the blimp
The world is mine, I can wink my eye, nigga
And your girl is mine, but I don't want her, I just want a billion
Stars in the ceiling, man I'm in the wraith, ay
Like Snoop Dogg, nigga, murder was the case, yeah
Play with me, you end up on Nancy Grace, yeah
This codeine, baby, do you want a taste? yeah
This the purple, I'm not commercial
We move slow, sorta like the Ninja Turtles
But give me pizza and I smoke a little reefer
Fifth grade, I used to watch Moesha
Skipped school, some of my partnas crip, some pyru
I'm a gangsta, homeboy, that don't apply to you
When I'm on the mic, nigga I don't lie to you
You fake, that's what you try to do
LA Leakers, man they fuckin' with the king
Milk does the body good but why I still sip the lean though?
I'm a motherfuckin' star like Ringo
We get work and I mean blow
Boss enjoy this shit, man we move this shit
Don't make me throw a couple 'bows like I'm Ludacris
Move bitch, get out the way
Before I have to crooked up your toupee
With a Tech 9, Cloverland my hood, I'ma rep mine
Yeah nigga this shit is in my mind
A legend like Bruce Springsteen
My car got a mind of her own, I call her Christine
That bitch'll crank up, we could shoot pool
Pull out the stick nigga, watch me bank stuff
Favorite rapper, Jadakiss and MJG
Pimp tight, I'm the K-I-N-G
King Life, the newest fuckin' record label
I'm connected in the streets just like cables
WIFI, ain't no need to high side
We walk up, we don't do no drive-bys
We peel off, this permanent
I can't never take my grill off unless I go spend 50k
Got a bag, fixed up my shit, right?
Still representin' Screwed Up Click, right?
Pull a knife out, stabbed him in his windpipes
I'm a hustler, I ain't tryin' to wear no pinstripes
I'ma get a billion dollars and put the finger up
Gettin' a lot of cream, put them zingers up
H-town nigga, that's where I come from
You better keep a chopper, nigga, fuck a stun gun
I don't even want you that close to me
I'm a shrimp nigga, don't bring no roast to me
When it come to freestyle, you should toast to me
I'm H-town's own, I'm a clover G
Acappella shit, I don't need no beat
I smoke it out the pipe, I don't need no sweet
I still run shit and I don't need no feet
Still sippin' codeine and I don't need no sleep
Man this freestyle shit, I do it with my eyes closed
I been makin' money since I was five years old
In the studio with the toolio
Livin' in a gangsta paradise like Coolio
Four more bars and I'ma end this shit
I'm like Shaq shootin' free throws, this is bricks
All up in my stash spot, I got more motherfuckin' keys than a laptop
Used to watch Matlock, 'bout to break the padlock
Still up in the do', vicious with this shit, you should call me Cujo
This a new flow, nigga, I ain't remember this
H-town shit and I'm on my December shit
Cold hearted nigga, Mozart a nigga
That mean I play keys, 400 degrees
Just like Juve, smoke a blunt to a doobie
If I can't go to the club with my toolie, deucie
