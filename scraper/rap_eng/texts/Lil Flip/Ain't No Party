Oh, next light bust a right
It's not gonna be too hard
If there's no parking on the street pull up on their front yard
Don't bring no vodka, or whisky
We've got everything you need
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat

Let's go down
Wash that sugar down
You gotta realize that there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year
Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better if you were only here
... Mmmm, oh, that's right. Mmmm
Prom night, Oscar night, got all that BS beat

There's twenty girls for every single boy
And their crazy from this heat
We'll take you up and down and everywhere in between
Mom and Dad are out of town all week
So you better get on your feet

If you can not find the lyrics you want, You may want to request them
Let's go down. Wash that sugar down
Ain't No Party
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better if you were only here
Mmmm. Oh I think it's gonna get hot tonight

Brothers and sisters moving in together so
So nice and tight
Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now
Oooh, those girls tend to hide (?)
And the temperatures rise
Better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling. ...

Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
Better believe that its gonna be the biggest night of the year
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better if you were only here
If only you were here
