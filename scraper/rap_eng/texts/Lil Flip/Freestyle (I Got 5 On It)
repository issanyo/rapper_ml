Yeah
Lil Flip nigga
Screwed Up Click nigga
Yeah
I'm Lil Flip, you know, diamonds in your face
You can't see my chain, let me shine it in your face
I'm a millionaire, top of the line
You got clothes in your closet but they not like mine
Iceberg Jeans, nigga, that's how I carry myself
Can't no hoe break my heart cause I'ma marry myself
I'm a million dollar star, do what I do
Slowed down music by Watts and Screw
And when I jump on a track you gon' want to listen
You ain't never seen a metallic Expedition
With all type of shit on the inside
Nigga, I'm Lil Flip, I blow endo right
And I put diamonds in your face
I bought the car, I bought the house
Motherfucking nigga representin' the Dirty South
Houston Texas, nigga, I'ma used to Lexus
If you can't see then I'ma use my necklace
I am the only star
Codeine is that shit Barre
Mix it up in the soda then I shake it
Blow a endo square, I'm at the naked
Looking at the hoes on the fucking pole
Lil Flip wear nothing but Girbaud's
Back in ninth grade, Kenny Cole
Now I got hoes that's 24
Everyday I'm gon' fucking shine
Houston Texas radio 97.9
I puff nothing but green pine
And I used to wear Calvin Klein
Now I got my own fucking name brand
35 carats on the same hand
Got Rolex on the same band
You know I stick to the game plan
I got to keep rapping til I die
Smoke endo weed, no fry
I'm gon' be a pimp til I die
If I get high I use Visine for my eyes
Cause I'm a weed smoker
Fuck Oprah, throat choker
You get out of line, nigga, I'ma provoker
I hit a nigga with a fucking jab
I'm the only nigga in the world that ain't never called a cab
I like to floss like a fucking dentist
I used to watch Dennis the Menace
I'm like Popeye I need my spinach
I got a Jeep and I need to tint it
Cause I like to roll the fucking speed limit
I used to go to basketball practice weed-scented
Smelling like a pound bout to go the last round
Lil Flip, nigga, cause you know it's going down
I'm that nigga that's ready for war
I'm that nigga that smoke weed and sip the Barre
I'm that nigga on the block with the pants just hangin'
I'm that nigga like ESG, I'm swangin' and bangin'
CD changin', four 15's, DVDs, I got 4 big screens
Falling out the ceiling cause nigga I'm a pimp
I jump out my car nigga I got a limp
Cause I'ma walk, talk the talk, walk the walk
Chill with Big Pokey, 3-2, Mike D, and HAWK
Them my niggas until the day I'm gone
Da Freestyle King I'm sitting on my throne
I can't be fucked with on this mic like Eminem
I'ma buy a track from Timbaland
But I'ma stack that hundred grand cause that's how much it cost
If you ain't sold 10,000 copies nigga you lost
So quit, go on start working at Mickey D's
Nigga cause this shit is really for G's
And ballers with fleas and collars and uh
If that hoe fine I'ma need your dollar
I'ma take her to the room, she gon' ride on my broom then I'm gone
Freestyle talking to a hoe on a hand-free phone
Now you know that's the way I do my shit
Nigga if you bootlegging you trying to screw my shit
But I'ma sue you bitch for doing that
If you see the Benz I'ma put two in that
And I'ma let you know nigga, off toppa nigga
I got more rhymes than a motherfucking choppa
I can't be fucked with on this motherfucking mic
Nigga freestyle, nigga do this shit for life
And when I leave then I have my music on this Earth
But if you shoot a slug nigga I'ma wet up your shirt
I mean that's that nigga flex
Remember, nigga you want checks
I'll snap your neck nigga bitch come correct
For fucking with a G, I'm the Screwed Up Click
I know you mad cause nigga I really blew up quick
Whore
