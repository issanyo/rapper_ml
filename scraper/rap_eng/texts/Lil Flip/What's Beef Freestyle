[Intro]
You know why?
I'm a rider
I'm a Clover G, nigga



What's beef?
Beef is when a nigga like you can't sleep
Wake up with no apetite and you can't eat
You better look both ways
When you walk on the streets
Nigga that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when a nigga like you can't sleep
Wake up with no apetite and you can't eat
You better look both ways
When you walk on the streets
Cause you don't want to bump heads
With a nigga like me




I'm a quiet nigga
But I let my guns talk
And you don't want too many bad words comin'
And I don't need help when I handle my biz'
I got rap niggas be on my dick
More than my bitch
I'm not a cupcake nigga
I'm hard as a rock
I'm like Pac, I got shot
Then I check myself out
The doctors told me to get a rest
But I went to the lab
I hit you with an uppercut
You shouldn't went for that jab
Now my whole state pissed
Cause you don't know who you diss
You diss me? Then you diss the whole Screwed Up Click
I ain't that nigga that start the trouble
But I know how to end it
And i don't play by the rules dawg
I know how to bend it
Real niggas respect me
They know I ain't no ho
But it ain't take me
4 videos to go gold


What's beef?
Beef is when a nigga like you can't sleep
Wake up with no apetite and you can't eat
You better look both ways
When you walk on the street
Cause you don't want to bump heads
With a nigga like me
