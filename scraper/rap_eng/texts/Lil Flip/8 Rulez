[Chorus]
1 - Never let a nigga know yo business
2 - Always start what you finish
3 - Stay on yo note don't slip
4 - Be careful cause these streets are a trip
5 - Always keep a Glock in yo whip
6 - Real niggas stick to the script
7 - Don't slang crack where you stay
8 - Just don't do it okay

[Lil' Flip]
In my hood all you see is dope fiends and dope dealers
Rats and roaches police and 4 wheelers
Metro's gun shoots piccalo
30-year-old men swingin drinkin bigalow
Stop signs but don't nobody ever stop
Theres ten groups in my hood but don't nobody drop
Plus the block is hot, and this dope game cold
Throught rain sleet or snow birds gotta get sold

[Somebody]
Birds get sold, I stand and watch the game unfold
My thing gets low, I teach the grain get gain and blowed
Leave the scene wit no clue
(Its kinda like you snooze you loose)
If you don't fuck wit me I ain't fuckin wit you

[Lil' Flip]
Check the game 'til you see my weapons aim
Nigga I ain't a rookie I'm a veteran mayne

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
Hustle for yo whip, stack fo yo mill'
Buy a cookie cutter then I'm in the wind
Back to home base, I'm on a paper chase
I'm not a case catcher so I can't catch a case
Money on my mind, and how am I gonna get it
I dress like I'm broke but I'm really running the city
Bricks turn into crumbs, gallons turn into one
Narcotics distubuting using guns
Money, cash, hoes, swangin gas full
If you don't pay the bills man thats all I know
Hustlers never sleep and sleepers never hustle
I'm on the interstate with a brick in my muffler
Keep it on a low cause niggas be snitchin
They'll do anything so they won't see prison
Man you never know yo cousin can be a snitch
And a month later undercovers taking yo piss
I'm off the block, somebody better call the cops
Shippin and handlin, when I'm not feedin the family
The family don't feed me I feed the family

[Chorus]
