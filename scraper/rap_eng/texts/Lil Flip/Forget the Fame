(Lil' Flip)
I come from a hood where everybody standing on the corner
What you need? some weed, speed, or some marijuana?
You can get it right here or get it down there
But when the laws pull up get away from 'round there
Now niggas think a nigga started changin
Just cause a nigga gotta platinum chain hanging
I still got the same niggas that I'm down with
If a nigga owe me money we gon'shoot down shit
I use to sell work I use to sell pints
But now I'm doing shit I got three million in the bank
I done made alot of moves and payed alot of dues
And if you fuck with me, you might make tonight news
Now niggas get on TV and forget they partnas
The ones who keep it real come to yo shows with the choppas
The one who bring that drank, bring that weed to yo house
Them the niggas down wit me that represent the South, uh

(Chorus)
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
No matter how rich I get Lil' Flip will never change
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
I do this shit so my patnas don't have to slang cain

(Lil' Flip)
Now everytime I get back somebody went to jail
But they taught us don't go to school and you will fail
I didn't go to college but its money in my wallet
And I just bought a Jag with zero mileage
Now people like "Flip, you know I'm tryin to rap"
But you was hatin on me, nigga you might get slapped
Your telephone tapped, you got the hood hot
Matter of fact it don't look good for you to be standin on the block
Nigga what about the cops? They rollin and lookin
And everybody know what you sellin and cookin
So get yo mind right nigga stay out the streets
You see what I did, now I play with these beats

(Chorus)

(Lil' Flip)
I'm like a hundred-dollar bill I'm hard change
And now its funny everybody ain't acting the same
Rule one never let niggas learn your business
Rule two never ever ever burn yo bridges
I had niggas that was hatin smilin in my face
Way before "Buy the Car, Buy the House", and "DiamondsNyaface"
Now they see me in the streets like "I wanna do a song"
Nigga yous a ho cry babies go home!
Cause you ain't selling records don't get mad
Cause you see me ballin hard in a drop top Jag
When you see me at The Source just chunk up a deuce
Cause I represent Cloverland jumpin out my Coupe
I'm still gon' be the same nigga on the scene
I'm still gon' be the only freestyle king......
