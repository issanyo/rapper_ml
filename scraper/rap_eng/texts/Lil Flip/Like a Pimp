[Chorus: Pimp C & Lil Flip]
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'

[Verse 1: Lil Flip]
By the time I hit the door I saw hoes on the floor
Niggas dressed in suits trickin' all they dough
Me? I'm a pimp, I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car or a new Rolex
'Cause I got street fame so hoes flock like birds
I got one holdin' the weed, I got one holdin' the syrup
When I hit the club, I'ma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga with bad table manners
We act bad, my nigga what is y'all saying?
Like when we walk inside clubs niggas hold they gal hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night
How could your gal leave me and be with you all night?
But it's all right, cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too Short said, "Bitches ain't shit"
I tried to told ya that most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to make they money every week

[Chorus: Pimp C & Lil Flip]
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'

[Verse 2: David Banner]
Step into club lookin' just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out "shake some' bitch!"
This is your song, tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake and Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong, been playa from the crib
So get out on the floor girl and get it how you live
And since you so hot, fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen but bitches hip me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake 'em up and let it go, yeah
And let them girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Like a pimp

[Chorus: Pimp C & Lil Flip]
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (Like a pimp!)
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'

[Verse 3: Lil Flip]
Now don't you hate them old
Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp

[Verse 4: David Banner]
Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up
Flip whipping Caddy trucks
Girls licking my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

[Verse 5: Lil Flip]
We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes

[Verse 6: David Banner]
Go on, touch your toes, and
Make me a roll and go on - hit the mall
And buy me some clothes, mane
And if your boy trip, I'mma bust a clip
Y'all bitches can't fuck with me and Lil Flip, nigga!

[Outro: Lil Flip]
Nigga. nigga
Yeah, nigga
This for the real money makers out there, you know?
Get yo mother fucking money
Don't worry bout the next nigga
Get yo mother fucking money
Get yo mother fucking money nigga
Uh get your money
