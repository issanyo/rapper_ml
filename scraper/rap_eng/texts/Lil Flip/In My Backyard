[Yung Redd]
Yeah, take a look into my backyard
Where there ain't no way out, and niggas wanna act hard
Watch your friends, some turn to fakers
That's why I smoke green acres
Get your paper, look around the world is violent
I, do my dirt and move in silence
Come on, you seen them capture, heard them sirens
Just come outside, boys are fighting
Yet the, grass is green, mosquitos biting
So I grabbed a pencil, and started writing
About the the shit we seen, the shit we did
And how we live, just growing up as a kid
Down in Houston Texas, its hot as hell
I know its hard to gain, easy to fail
Now days, anything might send you to jail
Take note, this is show and tell, in my backyard

[Chorus]
Ooh I never thought, that it would be this way
Living in the ghetto
Who would of thought that I could make a change
All I ever wanted, was to make it out this game
Living in the ghetto
I kept on trying until I found my way, my way

[Yung Redd]
From the porch to the street, from the street to the sto'
From the sto' to the corner, where a nigga sold dope
Put it together, this left niggas with no hope
But it seemed to twerk the block, work or stay broke
Oh no, back then money was slow
Wasn't cool to be bold, believe it I know
Wasn't no field of dreams, couldn't get no sleep
When cops popped the pistols, in the street
Now let's see, the ghetto's been shooting at me
Tell me to freeze, before I can stash my cheese
Some of us get caught, some make it out
Day in and day out, on a paper route

[Chorus]

[Yung Redd]
Waking up with the roosters, can't do what I use to
Like wasting time, fucking with losers
This is what goes on, way down here
Tell it like it is, we stay round here
All my niggas, get paid round here
Sometimes, people get sprayed round here
Hey, days and nights, nights and days
I use to dream of ways, to get paid
So now I'm, looking around to see what's shaking
Opportunity knocked, but my spot was vacant
Boys on the country, locked up for hustling
Game over, we just got time for nothing
You might see niggas yelling, always fussing
Around the way, this what happens everyday
So just put up your guards, times is hard
Live from the backyard, from the backyard

[Chorus]
