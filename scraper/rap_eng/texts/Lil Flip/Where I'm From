[Grafh talking]
Uh huh yeah look here
O-kay black kingdom stand up
My name Grafh ya'll-my nigga Lil' Flip
My nigga Gravy it's all gravy nigga
Watch this, uh uh let me show you what it's where I'm from
Ya hear me....it's like this
Listen up brick uh, yeah I said, I said

[Verse 1: Grafh]
Now where I'm from we got fiends that'll kill ya-4 that crack to serve
They keep it under they skin until it snap they nerves
They clap them burners that go(raaaattt)ya heard
Now every bullet gotta name-and every cap is deserved
The odyssey ain't gotta be my team
We tryna be the last of a dyin grave, we blast if you tryna play
Then spell it out for ya ass if you tryna read
You fall like the spot behind ya knees
You get sufforcated when you tryin to breathe
I dare you to try to sneeze lil'nigga-please lil'nigga
My snipers squeeze I gotta connect this dianese
Tryna keep dope and his rice and beans
I'm tryna show you what it's like in Queens ya heard me
I've sold dimes of green and if I ran out of sticky-icky
I'd sell a nigga dimes of seeds motherfucker I'm a hustler
(go get a dutch bruh)

[Chorus: Lil' Flip + Grafh]
Where I'm from niggas down to ride or die
Niggas don't get high off ya own supply
Where I'm from niggas pack Glocks and guns
We invest in bricks-fuck stocks and bonds

Now where I'm from niggas sell crack all day
And where I'm from niggas be buckin they mac all day
And where I'm from niggas'll hustle and pack all day
And where I'm from they'll clap off strays better run nigga!

[Verse 2: Lil' Flip]
I'll pistol whip a nigga in front of his click
Don't play with my money-you son of a bitch!
I'm a greedy motherfucker when it comes to mine
So I put in extra work in the summertime
'Cause ain't nobody in the world gon' give you shit
And don't nobody in yo' hood wanna see you rich
So fuck that I'm all about goin and get it
And if anybody in the way they gonna get it
I'm a G I was raised by killers and thug niggas
That'll sufforcate you(hard breathing)and leave you in a tub nigga
Hub niggas for kilo's-and take they work
Play with me and they gon' have yo face on a shirt
I don't play, won't play, I never did
I fucked up I could've been a better kid
But now it's too late to turn back-stripes on my shirt I earned that

[Chorus: Grafh + Lil' Flip - Repeat 2x]
Now where I'm from niggas sell crack all day
And where I'm from niggas be buckin they mac all day
And where I'm from niggas'll hustle and pack all day
And where I'm from they'll clap off strays better run nigga!

Where I'm from niggas down to ride or die
Niggas don't get high off ya own supply
Where I'm from niggas pack Glocks and guns
We invest in bricks-fuck stocks and bonds

[Verse 3: Gravy]
Yo where I'm from we do or die for that money
Ain't nothing funny, niggas is bummy, and hungry
Strugglin, hustlin don't mean shit where they sleep at
Tryna get off they G-pack, I'm from the (???)
Haters ain't never stop me yet
I made a couple of mistakes but ain't nothing I don't regret
It's $5.00 a pop in the hood for some cigarettes
Where I'm from niggas'll pop up where you rest
Where I'm from it's too much for a man to digest
Where I'm from niggas lose sleep and get no rest
Where I'm from it's too much for a man to digest
Where I'm from niggas lose sleep and get no rest
Where I'm from we aim shoot at ya neck(where I'm from)

[Verse 4: Will-Lean]
Where I'm from I run with a pack
Of killers and ex con's that'll run in ya drought
Them three bricks right there they come with them rats
And if the cops hit the spot, I'll have 'em runnin in laps
I'm the same young nigga pumpin that crack
I'm the same young nigga dumpin the gat
I'm the same young nigga that'll jump out the 'Lac
Hit you with the mac and watch that shit jump out ya back
Throw the gun in the back, plus the bump, and the mac
Motorize stash box for that
So know you know we don't keep 'em under the mat
Fuckin with the Clover nigga have you under attack

[Chorus: Lil' Flip + Grafh - Repeat 2x]
Where I'm from niggas down to ride or die
Niggas don't get high off ya own supply
Where I'm from niggas pack Glocks and guns
We invest in bricks-fuck stocks and bonds

Now where I'm from niggas sell crack all day
And where I'm from niggas be buckin they mac all day
And where I'm from niggas'll hustle and pack all day
And where I'm from they'll clap off strays better run nigga!
