Huh huh
I had to do somethin like dis
Ya know
Huh I shoulda listened
I shoulda listened

[Lil' Flip - Verse 1]
I shoulda listened, when ya said boy go and get a job
I shoulda listened, cause you gotta sell dope or rob
I shoulda listened, when you told me I need to go to college
But right now I'm tryin to money in my wallet
I shoulda listened, when you said boy make good grades
But instead I was worryin about dem new j's
I shoulda listened, when you said boy dont get no tattoos
Now it's 2 years later and now I got 22
I shoulda listened, when you said keep playin basketball
But I was makin mo money standin in the hall
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to be in the church
But that's hard "why" cause everyday I gotta concert
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to watch my friends
Cause yesterday my partner got jacked fo' his Benz
I shoulda listened, when you said dont stand on the corner
Cause all black folks do is smoke marijuana

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I shoulda listened, when yo told me dont do that I did it any way
I shoulda listened, when yo told me dont hustle but I gotta get paid

[Lil' Flip - Verse 2]
I shoulda listened, when you said quit standin on the block
Cause all that do is make it easy fo the cops
I shoulda listened, when you said it dont matta what car you drive
Long as you pay yo bills long as you survive
I shoulda listened, when you said dont be hangin at the club
Cause people get drunk and wanna shoot the club up
I shoulda listened, when you said you can't please everybody
Right now I'm findin out I dont need everybody
I shoulda listened, when you said dont brind dem niggas to ya house
Cause when you ain't there theyll try to break in ya house
I shoulda listened, when you told me you read what ya so
So everybody I meet I can't treat'em like a ho
I shoulda listened, when ya told me do somethin wit my time
So I picked up the pen and paper and now I'm writtin ryhmes
I shoulda listened, when you said forget the money put God first
So that's the way I gotta end my verse

[Chorus] - repeat to fade
