[Verse 1]
Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend
I wish I had a loving man in my life
I wish I had a father
Maybe then I would’ve turned out right
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you
Oh, I wish I had a suntan
I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine
I wish I had a beach house
Then we could make a big fire every night
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you, in love with you

[Verse 2]
Listen to my mouth, nigga I meant it
Don’t fuck with me unless you want your swag pregnant
A nigga bad grammar, I run on sentence
I am just a rapper, so I don’t need practice
I am just different, I eat/sleep genius
Forever I love Atlanta, I stunt these Filas
Swag celibate, I don’t fuck with these bitches
Smoke these niggas, turn ‘em all swishers
Can’t make up my mind I gotta fuck both sisters
And my flow is retarded, I spit autism
Got that shit to make ya bounce like Tigger
‘Cause I am more childish than “good job” stickers

Your girl’s in the room so I don’t have any jeans on
We are at war, so my wallet is the Green Zone
We can do this shit, any time, anywhere
And you know you aren’t me and I know it isn’t fair
Yeah, these niggas apple trees, they need to grow a pair
I balled in the store, but nigga, I got hair
And as soon I got here, the girls act different
But I don’t have to act, I’ve been different for a minute, mothafucker
