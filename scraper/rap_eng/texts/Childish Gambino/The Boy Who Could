THE BOY
I don’t want to go yet…

DUDE 2
Sorry its destiny

That word rings in the Boy’s head as he sees the bullet comes towards him. He sees everything around him slowing down time and space. He had heard that word before a long time ago… it feels like almost in a distant dream now...

Blackness…

Suddenly brightness all around the Boy turns his head they have arrived at the Methodist church. Camp is over. He swings his legs into the open aisle. There are a lot of girls laughing. The Boy doesn’t know why or care. Until he sees Michelle walk up to him and say one word destiny. He feels like he heard this before in strange dream

He leaves the bus and sees his chauffeur and high fives him

And the pattern continues…

The End
