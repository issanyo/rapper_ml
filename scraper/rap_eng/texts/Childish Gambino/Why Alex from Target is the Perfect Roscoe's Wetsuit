If you've read becausetheinter.net, you'll vividly remember the ongoing mystery of Roscoe's Wetsuit. If you search it on Google or visit different sites dedicated to Roscoe's Wetsuit, you'll find that the true meaning of it is absolutely nothing. Something that means nothing has become famous for absolutely no reason.

Alex from Target is a real life version of Roscoe's Wetsuit because it means absolutely nothing. Some random person has (again) become famous for no reason at all. For the past three days, twitter has been obsessed with Alex, just as THE BOY was obsessed with Roscoe's Wetsuit.

Alex from Target was interviewed by Ellen instead of Lauren Hill, a girl with a brain tumor who inspired sports fans around the country by scoring two baskets in Hiram College's opening game. A random target worker who got his picture taken is more famous than a terminally ill basketball player who courageously inspired millions of Americans.

Let that sink in.
