[Verse 1]

Remember back in high school was the first time that ya caught my eye
Saw you walking down the hall, should I stop you and say hi?
Ask a couple questions like "whats ya name & do ya mind
If i got to know you cuz i promise i won't waste ya time"
But i let my chance go thinking I can't make you mine
Infatuated, I'm in love yooo, need ya in my life
Crazy thing about this is my first name, you don't even know
Now you kissing Justin, teacher told me " that's his girlfriend bro"
After graduation I saw ya chilling looking mighty fine
Curly hair, light eyes sparkle like a glass of wine
Shes the meaning of beautiful but redefined
A goddess on earth with a aura that's so divine
Fast forward one more year, must be magic, made you mine
The moon and the stars in the sky must have realigned
Reminiscing on the first time i saw ya walking by
When the sun rise you're the reason that i sing this rhyme

[Hook]
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
