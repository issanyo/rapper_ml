[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I stay on Ice like my name was Disney
Naw, I'm ok but my drink is tipsy
Nigga i'm hungry, I rap in my sleep
I eat MCs with a side of beats
My flow ain't cold, but my neck all froze
Call me homies cause the nasty clothes
Christian Doir. Man I made it
The flow so juice like concentrated
Ballin' on a budget 'til my ship came in
Now i'm always on the water like a dorsal fin
Gangsta boo boo, you know the hustler
Addida[s] and diesel's favorite customer
"boy stop", you know it's paper
I got an upgrade, like basic cable
MY words all slured cause my head unstable
Drugs can't do like Cane and able
