DUDE 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. DUDE 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming
DUDE 1 looks bad. He’s bleeding heavily and is wheezing. It won’t be long until he dies
THE BOY
So.... what now?
He raises his gun to THE BOY
BANG, BANG, BANG!
THE BOY is hit and falls to the floor but he doesn’t feel a thing. Matter of fact he hadn’t felt anything since he’s gotten there. No fear, no regrets, not even pain
As THE BOY lies on the floor bleeding with an emotionless face, spiders slowly drop from the ceiling. They whisper:
			....who are you?
	....what is this?
....Why?
THE BOY thinks to himself. “Is this all a dream? Somebody help me. Somebody help ME!”
He lies there, waiting. Just then a phone rings. It’s his. He crawls over to DUDE 1. He’s dead now. He reaches into his back pocket and takes out his phone. It’s NAOMI
NAOMI
Hey…
THE BOY
Hi
NAOMI
How was the run?
THE BOY
It almost killed me. (He said jokingly)
Naomi giggles. There was a brief moment of silence
NAOMI
I’m going to sail out real soon. Want to join me?
“Sail Out” that was her innuendo for getting high
THE BOY
I don’t know, I don’t think I’ll make it home today
NAOMI
Oh... well, I guess I’ll just go. See you later?
THE BOY
No.... Stay
NAOMI
Why?
THE BOY
I want to hear your voice
I’ll tell you what, I’ll sail out with you from here…
NAOMI
Okay
You can hear NAOMI spark up a lighter. She deeply inhales. It was quite for a moment
THE BOY
Sing to me?
NAOMI
What?
THE BOY
Sing for me. I want you to sing for me. Your voice is so peaceful
NAOMI
Okay
She inhales and exhales again
*******[PLAY SONG "BED PEACE" AT THIS POINT]*******
THE  BOY lays there, listening to NAOMIs voice
The camera pans out from THE BOYS emotionless face.  As it pans out you see THE BOY lying motionless with the spiders swaying from the ceiling. He inhales one last time...
As the camera looks down on THE BOY his phone flashes. He got a text message from and unknown number: “………Roscoe’s Wetsuit”
