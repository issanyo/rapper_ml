[Intro]
How's it going Sesame Street?
How great is this?
The greatest

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you got a problem, the kind you can't erase
Sometimes it jumps up and slaps you in the face
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out

[Hook]
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and don't shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the problem's easy, you solve it right away
Sometimes the problem's tricky, you work it all day
But either way you think it through, that's what it's all about
You put your heads together and figure it out
