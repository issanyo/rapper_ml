There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh!
Oh, you can't run from me

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
