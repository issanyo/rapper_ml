[Verse 1 - YOMP]
I guess I’m just your worst nightmare
White kid rapping designing for retail
You start trembling like you are scared
They used to think that I was mentally impaired
And now I’m the guy that you aspire to be
Even though it high school I was the kid you bullied
America loves the story of the underdog
But I do it big, so I study abroad
By my clothes, I’m so unofficial
I may be qualified as a UN official
Rappers start asking me if I can do their production
Nah man I only do in-house production
I’m not being rude, I just have no time
So I have judge if you are worth my time
All my crew is super talented
I would like to see you try to challenge it
They say YOMP where’ve you been
I've been here the whole time
You were too busy laughing to know it was my time
They're already asking how are you not signed
I am to my label I don't have a cosign
