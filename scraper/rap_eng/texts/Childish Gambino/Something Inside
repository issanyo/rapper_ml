[Verse 1: Dekay]
Had something inside, though he couldn’t provide
A wifey and a kid, and for those two he’d die
Swallow his pride and do what he had to do
Just to make it through the day to day bullshit they pitch at you
Though he’s keepin’ his hands up and he’s hittin’ hard
Sometimes life throws curves and stitches leave scars
But it doesn’t matter though when the love you’ve got will never fold
Even when flush and anger rush, you never give up
You never let go, ‘cause everybody knows
Once the story’s told and the curtain’s closed that you gotta go
Even with a ticket to the next show
You’re never cold with a hand to hold
And that boy needs you so
You better stand up, even when rushed
With a blitzkrieg of bad luck
You can’t stand stuck, man up
Or even woman up too, with that Kung Fu
Iron fists and Lucy Liu, crouching ego hidden passion, K. West fashion
Guns blazin’ smashin’, kickin’ ass and
Chewin’ bubblegum can be troublesome when you’re out that
Big League Chew, and when Power Rangers shoot at you like “pew pew pew!”
Who knew that shit you dropped was pee-ewe
And this kid’s doe, and mares eat oats
I’ll probably eat ivy too, ‘cause I’m a grimy dude
Who likes limey food like ceviche and sopes too
And plus I’m super serious on April fools

[Chorus: Lovefoxxx]
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you, boy
But you're still the same
[Repeat]

[Verse 2: Gradient]
There’s something inside me that needs to release
I’m hungry inside but rhymin’ is what’s feedin’ the beast
While frequently I’m seekin’ to be keepin’ the peace
An easily defeated MC I’m ceasin’ to be
And luckily I have a few that’s believin’ in me
And wanna hear the shit I say when I’m speakin’ on beats
It might be a bit redundant but I’ll make it repeat
I’m leavin’ everything on the table I saved you a seat
So rest in peace, I’m blessed to be
Feelin’ so alive, right?
The attention is kinda sour
Call it limelight
Limestone, mind blown, I’m on Rhyme Zone
Nice flow, let it bleed, type O negative
Get a sedative, it's a good verse, pretend it is
Euthanize the animal inside, no, let it live
I invented this, like Edison
Bet it is complex, Oedipus
I’m next in a long succession
Of awkward men who would not address
The consequence of talking nonsense
Like me. With leftovers who the best?
I stay hungry, Budapest
A moral lesson, stay low-key (Loki) like Thor’s brethren
Furious Curious George or Costanza
Deviate from the stanza, I make advances
Stole a line from Acid Rap
You could say I take Chance’s

[Chorus]
