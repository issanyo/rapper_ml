[Verse 1: Flynt Flossy]
Ch-ch-check the blogs, what you gon' see?
Everybody talk about Flynt Flossy
Is he real? He can't rap
Take that back, I rip all tracks
And some blogs be talking smack
Been chill too long, time to react
(Y'all got fans?) Yes, we do
And sold-out shows so screw you too
Floss got fame now, he's sexy
Damn, these girls be all on me
Open those legs bon appetit
Gimme those toes when you lick them feet
Like doggy food, I'm pedigree
So hating blogs get off of me
Don't care 'bout what you gotta say
And no, I'm not Charlie Murphy!

[Verse 2: Yung Humma]
I hang with the Jeep, bang with the Jeep
Got lady fans that really wanna smang with a Jeep, y'all
Think it's a date, won't creep, wanna peep
Tryna dig up dirt, yeah the jeeps gon' sleep
Too difficult to figure out so little bloggers simmer down
Or you just might lose it
Have a seat, shut your mouth, turn us up
Take the thinking cap off, and enjoy the music
Where I'm from? Does it make a difference?
If I said to look away, would you turn around
And take me off the hit-list?
I don't think so
Are you mad right now? Yeah, I know
Go home, put your thumb in your mouth
And lay in a position thatâ€™s fetal
No time for babies
All the credit to the fans who ladies
Start writing this trash in your blog
Play around, acting like you hate me

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Yeah
I'm a Mac Pro with an afro
And you guys blow like the Satchmo
And my cash flow out the asshole
And my last show was the Camp Tour
Saw your blog on Thursday
You only re-blog shit girls say
You didn't re-tweet my birthday
All your comments say "first" or "so gay"
Okay, we the fanboys
Sex fantasies with Androids
But I fuckin' mean what I'm writing
If I see you, nigga, we fightin'
On that shit, take a whiff
Move in silence like a .gif
If you try to hack my phone, you'll see pics when you ain't home
Man, royalty to the maximum
Got racks, and we stackin' 'em
I like beef when it's actual
I love how niggas talk that shit when you know you ain't catching 'em
Man, racist on your page, you should be on Key & Peele
Is that really how you feel?
Nigga, the internet isn't real!
Yeah, I saw a lady get fucked in the ass by a goat
Laugh for an hour, that's all she wrote
Would I laugh if I saw that shit in real life?
Yes (yeah)
Fuck your blog with a broomstick
I could fuck your girl with a Q-Tip
If I see you, nigga, let's do shit
Gambino boy, you stupid
