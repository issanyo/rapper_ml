[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Sitting here wearing acid washed jeans
Pressing in to the scenes of all the things I've seen
Slight twitch of your skin on my lips
Could it be a lie if I think about this?
Hearing sickened thoughts you now
Hold my breath counting back a lot
Professional no sleep, just you wake
In a place where ghosts start to take shape
I spy with my eye
All the buzz around my hive
When I'm with another guy
You're the one that haunts my mind
One floor beneath me, you're
Your ear to the ceiling
Feeling all I'm feeling
Peaking through hidden meanings, said

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
And everywhere you are
I fall in love and scared in
The dark I can pretend
You're all that I need
I love the thing you are
Holding on to this
Lost in the dark and you pretend
You're here to save me

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Ghost
I mean it, yeah really, I mean it
It's the king you were hoping for
He mean with the open doors
He mean with the text that say "I like you"
Smiley face, one with hearts-y eyes
Dude who's smiling
Man, these toodles island can't be reached
For like a week it's hide and seek
Now she wildin'? But keep it cool, mama
You know the rules, mama
He gets to say you fuckin' cray
You act a fool mama
Have your older cousin pull them tools on 'em
Anyway, anyway
It's that everyday, everyday
And them pirates in Pyrex are giving ladies that baby face?
You notice
That's why the whole flow precocious
These lubricated Magnums to magnum opus
I miss you

[Hook]
