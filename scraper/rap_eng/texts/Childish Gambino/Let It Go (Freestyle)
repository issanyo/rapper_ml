[Hook]
Ugh, no excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't goin say the I embody this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Let em know
No excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't goin say the I embody this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing

[Verse]
Fandango my mandingo
We should do a movie
Groupies looking like the yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuze me I'm on the ooie
My pockets on life with louie
Euros is different colours my wallet look like a coogi
He who speaking the least is chief keepin the peace
Leaving seeds in your niece
Praying that she ain't late
Spraying like that AK
Now that shit my namesake
Bino you so nasty
Ass like an ash tray
I'm smoking Larry Lotus
Used to be Jehovahs
I'm in your girl and now she feeling polish like perogies
They hoping that they smoke us
Nah dude never that
Tripping off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your hienus and you haribo like gummy bears
Why I'm fly like cockpit you no fly like ostrich
Stupid shit like a moshpit
Can't believe this is toxic

Ain't goin say that I embody this
You ain't goin say that I embody this
Mutha fucka let em know
You ain't say that I embody this
Mutha fucka tell this mutha fucka dat ain't know
Let em know
