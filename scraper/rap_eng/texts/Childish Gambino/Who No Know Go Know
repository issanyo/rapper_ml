[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
He stood in front of me
Everything that I was and what I wanna be
Shots fired, over a hundred G's
And if it wasn't be you, then who's it gonna be?
I never been such a (?) or alone
Sat in the (?) but couldn't stand for his tone
I'm out in New York with my hand on the phone
With a message to my Grammy saying "Man I'm so home"
I'm so home, I'm so grown ass man
But is it worth it?
Black man no perfect, white man no perfect
Praise his name, the hole blows sound, so sharp shit
That's why a nigga proceed straight from Kirkland
A million leaders just millimeters from grabbing heaters
I couldn't leave 'em, to call up my cousin had to believe him
Just to bow down
But we don't see each other, yeah I'm fine now
But I don't know my mother, she left me
America my foster care
I tried to get a hold of her, but I lost the trail
Tried to get her phone number but my pops in jail
I'm posted up on corners with rocks in hand
My big brother taught me how to go and move how a crook move
"Walk tall in the streets, don't be shook, dude"
This is our home, it might be broken but it's still good
You might be joking but you're still hood
They think they know you but they don't
They wanna own you but they won't
They wanna say "nigga, what's up?" Woah
We're not there yet, but I hear you whisper through the air vents
