[Verse 1: Josh Osho]
Ordinary days but these ain't ordinary times
I lost to making waves, I know there's something on our minds
We need something so beautiful when you feel your losing ground
Someone to keep you straight up tall, 'cuz no one wants to fall, Fall

[Hook]
We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

[Verse 2: Josh Osho]
Tryna make a change, going down a different avenue
If anytime I stop, at least I know where I am heading to
So won't ya, join the revolution cuz I been missing you
'Till we all know where this story goes, we're climbing up these walls, Walls

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Money left to burn, we can do whatever
Ain't you know that I'm a boss? Check my Kelsey Grammer
Stank attitude but she smilin' when we kiss
But I love my baby mama, cuz she do not exist
Do not mess with Bino, Egon with ego
Haters missed the goal like Shaq did with free-throws
Yo time un poquito, no habla un gringo
Do not knock on the door unless necessito
I’m chilling at the Waldorf, eating on some grapefruit
When everybody likes you, everybody hates you
That’s just the territory
I got to be honest, it’s very boring without a hater there to make a story
They want to tell you what’s in your heart, don’t start
Getting Salieri on my Mozart
I'mma play some Go-Kart with my little brother
Cause life is only living when we livin' for each other

[Hook]
