[Verse 1: Ludovin]
This is how to find a party
I never thought I wanted
I used to think that I would forget
And now it always gonna be too late
But the lights still turned on
I can't stop, let it go
All I ever did was turn into one
I never thought that it would be too much fun

[Bridge]
Up all night, catching all those fights
I never ever tried to pick up my lights
What ever model trick that you turned into
I never really thought that I would fall for you
But now we're here together in the same old room
But we're talking to each other like the kids will do
Got my money in my head and I'll be saving for the heavens
It's a whole new world, I just hope that you get in
I do

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Deleted you off my desktop
That doghouse and petshop
We ain't working
I thought our love would always be that sweatshop
So please stop
I don't wanna hear that I'm everything that he's not
I don't read texts or eavesdrop
I just freestyle in that G-spot
And I'm crushed up cause I fucked up
Nice car, nigga what what
Nice girl, she turned slut
I can use the b-word
She can use the n-word when we fuck
Sold my soul and then re-up
I don't kiss or eat her
She just meet my cousin Skeeter
ITunes a motherfucker, playin' Angela Bofill
Dude, the chord changes made a nigga feel so real
Loved and hated that I made you feel womanly like Aretha
Cuttin' out the dirty parts don't make sense like, "I beat the beat the"
Pussy up
On the radio
Play me though
When I'm not around, man, those songs are mostly yours
Staring out you like, "Dag, where did he come from?"
And I guess this is how wackpeoplemeet.com
I'm like
