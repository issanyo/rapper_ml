[Chorus: Jr. Hi]
Trillion girls, abusers of my body, baby
Trillion girls, make me feel like nobody, baby
Trillion girls, too bad for me cause now it take
A trillion girls, to revert my hurt
Trillion girls, and every one reminds me of you, baby
Trillion girls, and every one of them are just as crazy
Trillion girls, I need my sensory deprivation
And a trillion girls, to rule my world

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
God is a woman, who else could still love us?
Mother Earth so fucked, they ain't even use rubbers
Now her kids run around tryna smash like their dad
And they sayin' they don't miss what they really never had
I try to find the peace that I had inside of her womb
Stillborn, fetal position, cradled inside a tomb
Like Tutankhamen, they hoot and hollerin' for a king
But the queen is for real, what's a yang with no yin?
Life hack like a terminal cough, watch 'em go off
Lowercase so all my talkin' is soft
Got some giraffe by a succubus, suckin' my homunculus
Met her at the beach, she was down like my comforters
Girl (Are you ready for me?) Been ready for you
Make a comeback in that V, Vendetta for you
Bino don't rap, this is art, been said it for you
But every time you go in, you lose somethin'

[Chorus: Jr. Hi]
Trillion girls, abusers of my body, baby
Trillion girls, make me feel like nobody, baby
Trillion girls, too bad for me cause now it take
A trillion girls, to revert my hurt
Trillion girls, and every one reminds me of you, baby
Trillion girls, and every one of them are just as crazy
Trillion girls, I need my sensory deprivation
And a trillion girls, to rule my world

[Bridge: Jr. Hi]
Reveal to me all of your, all your love, open your everything
Open your everything, O-open your everything
Reveal to me all of your, all your love, help me to elevate
Help me to elevate
God is a woman, God is a woman

[Verse 2: Jr. Hi]
Truth, baby, since you fucked me on the phone
I'm a honey hot suicide
But I'm never gonna fall in love again
I fuck with that, I fuck with that
Even when they bring my body back
I fuck with that, I fuck with that
Now I know a trillion ways to forget you
I'll never have a dream without a connection
So let me drown in fake Heaven, for all time

[Chorus: Jr. Hi]
Trillion girls, abusers of my body, baby
Trillion girls, make me feel like nobody, baby
Trillion girls, too bad for me cause now it take
A trillion girls, to revert my hurt
Trillion girls, and every one reminds me of you, baby
Trillion girls, and every one of them are just as crazy
Trillion girls, I need my sensory deprivation
And a trillion girls, to rule my world

[Bridge: Jr. Hi]
Reveal to me all of your, all your love, open your everything
Open your everything, O-open your everything
Reveal to me all of your, all your love, help me to elevate
Help me to elevate
God is a woman, God is a woman
