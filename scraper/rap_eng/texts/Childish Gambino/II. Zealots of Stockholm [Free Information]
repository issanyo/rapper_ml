[Intro: Childish Gambino]
When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around, I feel you in and out
How are you? Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken, I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son, oh
You're a good son
Oh, you're a good son

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Free information, free information
Free information, free informa— ma—

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose (woo!)
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
It took me like, five minutes to figure out
What the voices those were, on the phone
But I figured it out...

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
Is it real cause you're online?
Is it real cause you're online?
Is it real cause you're online?
Is it real (cause you're on) line?

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude]
I'm a freaky bitch
I am five foot eight, 390
And I am a freaky bitch

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie, nevertheless
I got that fresh like it was Crest, grind cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous, Lost God, never pray
Forgotten us, lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gon' miss Heaven
Why do it by two inches? Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches

[Outro]
Getting next level in a hotel
Ain’t shit that we don’t need, nigga, oh well
