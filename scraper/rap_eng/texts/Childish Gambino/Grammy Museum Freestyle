[Verse]
Royalty my partner them
No one else might partner them
Stay strapped with that arsenal
These niggas winnin', it's hard to tell
Move over, we about to take over
Slide up in them DMs, young nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused
I'm the man of the hour, play me on power
Play me on hot, nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop
Flow so cold put a cherry on top
Haters so made he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy
Father your feelings are proud of me, head was so good it's psychology
God damn, I'm justing being who I am
From that weird ass little kid to that grown ass [?] man
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem
Chain been burr since Novem, that means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'
If your man don't want to lick it I volunteer as tribute
You niggas on those Hunger Games, I eat them O's like onion rings
I kill them hoes so constantly
Y'all ain't even gotta [?] hold it
See them titties, wanna motorboat it
I'm Dopaliscious like Spottie Ottie
Y'all don't know me, run the world
Gettin' hype like that little girl whose like
Ay-Ay-Ay-Turnup!
