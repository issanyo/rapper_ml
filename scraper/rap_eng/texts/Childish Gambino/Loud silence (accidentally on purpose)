The Boy and Dude 2 turn to look towards the door. Dude 1’s body falls through the door with his arms slowly falling to the floor. Blood everywhere. Well not everywhere just where ever it really matter. His chest. Specifically his heart

Dude 2 jumps to help Dude 1. Too late. Dude 1 was done

GUNSHOTS. Dude 2 was done. Blood everywhere. This time his head

It is expected that the other dudes are done

.....where are you.....

A figure stands in the dark. The lights from the city behind the mansion lit the outline of the figure, but only a smile stands out. It is a girl. From the looks of it, adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise

The female figure (Abella Anderson) muffles in the dark

FIGURE
You done?

THE BOY
I was trying to be

The Boy looks towards the infinity pool overlooking the world with glossy empty eyes

FIGURE
No you weren’t. Cause, guess what?

The figure whispers and fades

FIGURE
Destiny. (slight laugh)

“What the Fox Say” ringtone rings and vibrates irregularly from The Boy’s phone from Dude 1’s pocket. The Boy reaches into Dude 1’s pocket slowly as if there was a chance for him to wake up. He was done

He unlocks his phone to read the notifications

The Boy leaves the empty bodies in the foyer in front of the Buddha statue and heads to his room

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - LATER NIGHT

The Boy nearly collapse on his bed with his eyes focused on the corner of the room. His eyes near towards a closing point. The spider crawls back to his web. The boy reaches into his pock and clinches the “hackz” flash drive

....here are you....

Silence
