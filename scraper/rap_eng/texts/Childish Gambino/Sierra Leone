Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside

Yelling

VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

Dude 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. Dude 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming

The Boy walks out of the closet in the bathroom of the mansion
He’s alone
He walks around and realizes the place isn’t trashed just dirty
He goes out back. Vanessa is sitting at the edge of  the pool

The Boy
Hey

Vanessa
Hey

They sit in silence for a while. It’s awkward

The Boy
What is this?

When he says that Fam and Marcus walk out of the house and joke and shit. They don’t look at him
The boy is used to this
He realizes Vanessa is holding his hand
The Boy
You don’t like me

Vanessa
I do though

The Boy
Let’s not do this now

Vanessa
Yeah

Someone puts on Thinkin Bout You. The boy laughs. Naomi walks out and sits next to him on the otherside. She holds his hand

Naomi
Things will be fine

The Boy
Nothing real is ever fine

Naomi smiles

Naomi
I know

Steve, Fam, Marcus, Sasha, and everyone else come over and stand around the boy. The sunset is making it all golden. THe lights in the house are already on. By this time Sierra Leone is playing
The Boy get’s it
Roscoe’s wetsuit
The boy’s chest erupts as bullets hit him. He feels nothing. Vanessa and Naomi let him fall into the pool. He feels water fill him. There is no wave of euphoria. He just floats there. Himself
