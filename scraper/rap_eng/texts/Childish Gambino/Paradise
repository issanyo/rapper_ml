[Hook: Childish Gambino]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up

[Verse 1: EZEC]
Sun is out and the waves are crashing
She's a movie star, the cameras flashing
When we talking, you take me away
Wake up, go to sleep, talking all day
We lock the door, chill in the studio
Yeah she an actress, fitting that movie role
She always be calling, we chilling on the beach
Lemme hold your hand, don’t care about the reach
Life is like a ferris wheel
It goes up and down
I could be in the middle
Or I could be on the ground
Yeah, life is a ride, hope you ride that with me
Let's go round and around, girl we can make some history
No mystery, God put us here for a reason
Falling in love, spring into action, that's the seasons
I know I'm about to make it, I'm about to blow up
Till 3005 it's just us as long as you hold up

[Hook: Childish Gambino & EZEC]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up x8
(I feel like I’m in paradise)
(Looking at you, I’m paralyzed)
(I'm a lucky man, but I don’t ever gotta pair of dice)
(I don't need Miami, I don't need the Bahamas)
(Just take me away, no strings and no drama)
(Hold up!) x6
(Feel like I'm in paradise) x2

[Verse 2: EZEC]
Am I sleeping? Cause your my dream girl
But I’m not dreaming, I’m in the real world
But you might be, wake you up with a text
I pray to God everyday, damn I feel so blessed
And I'm trying to be a legend, can you put me on the map?
Record a love song then I just play it back
Mix it, master it, finish it, yeah then I send it
Yeah we together, but we could be independent
So I can feel the warmth whenever were together
And I hope you like this song, every word and every letter
Cause you take me to this state of mind
I don’t know the place or time
You can take me back, to when I was writing basic lines
I knew I'd find you some day, it would happen one day
Watching the sunset, just ask and we can run away
We chilling at night, hit you up the next day
And if you ever lonely, all you gotta do is press play

[Hook: Childish Gambino & EZEC]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
Hold up (x8)
(I feel like I’m in paradise)
(Looking at you, I’m paralyzed)
(I'm a lucky man, but I don’t ever gotta pair of dice)
(I don't need Miami, I don't need the Bahamas)
(Just take me away, no strings and no drama)
(Hold up!) x6
(Feel like I'm in paradise) x5
