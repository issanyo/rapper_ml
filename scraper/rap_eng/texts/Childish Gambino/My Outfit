A kid at the oakland DEEP WEB TOUR stop asked me if i would “change my clothes once i made a million.”

I decided to write this:





I guess i wrote all this to say that my attire is deliberate as much as it isn’t.  clothes aren’t really important.  they’re fun and can accentuate the parts of u or ur personality u want people to notice. i do love and appreciate good, well made/ designed clothes. but they’re not necessary. like a lot of things. like art. like us.  that’s kinda what makes it special

"will u change ur clothes once u reach a million?"

I spent 1.2 million out of my own pockets on the DEEP WEB TOUR before wordpress came in and helped with the rest.  because this tour is me.  we use clothes to make a statement about ourselves. that’s what they’re for.  and my clothes, right now, are me
