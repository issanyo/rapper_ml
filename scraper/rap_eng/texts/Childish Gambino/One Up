Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 1: Crash]
We party all night, until it's fuckin' sunny
They wanna paper chase but they can't find that shit like Kony
Tried to tell you fuckers that Dead is the one and only
So just hand over the deed because we motherfuckin' own it
Hold up wait a moment, they can't talk to me im zonin'
If you think you at the top then you jumping off like the omen
I'm in the bed with a redhead, I call that bitch... Conan
Pause... alright now I'm bout to go in
I was always Senpai, even back in high school
But now these days, all they wanna do is fight you
Talk to the wrong person, never know what they might do
Talk shit in your inbox next minute they wanna Skype you?
But fuck all that shit, honestly I could care less
Cause now I'm so cold, I get dumped on people for ALS
Acting like you hot, but it ain't what it seems
Cause if you spit fire, then my bars are Steel Beams
Crash

[Verse 2: Tim Saunders]
I was in a groove, but now I'm in my zone
Crashy was the leadoff now I'm bout to hit him home
Laughing to the bank while they crying for a loan
Getting big in the post, man I'm feeling like Malone
I don't make songs about holding no gun up
The Rocky steps in Philly are the only place I'll run up
So if them niggas want some beef I give them niggas thumbs up
Run the game like Mario, now watch me get this one up
Timmy on a come up, they wanna see him down
But they don't do shit, just like the Cleveland Browns
I'm so Dark Knight, I ain't fucking with you clowns
If you niggas on top then imma fucking knock you down
Yeah the flow is so Keri Hilson, got money like Paris Hilton
My temperament Deron Willams, don't make it go Darren Wilson
I came here to eat, got me feeling like a pair of pilgrims
I should be on SNL cause these verses I'm tearin, kill em
One up
