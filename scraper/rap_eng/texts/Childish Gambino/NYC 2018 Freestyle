Give me, um
Give me something on like
Give me something on this tempo, on
This time, that's like
Give me something on the bass that's like
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do-doo, do
Do-do-do-doo, do
Give me something on the organ that's like
Doo-doooo
Yeah, there we go

[Intro]
Watch me, watch me, baby
I know, it's hard
Drop me, drop me, baby
I know, I can see the stars
The stars I love, we get old
Wanna believe in this lie, I see
Can you tell me, what's on your mind?
'Cause your love is so hard to find

[Verse 1]
People used to count me out
People want to get flyin' out like a stamp
People used to count me out
People used to talk that shit when I was at Camp
People used to count me out
People used to tell me all that bullshit's real tho
People used to count me out
'Cause music ain't shit, that's why I changed the deal
Man, I gotta do my own thing
I gotta do my own thing, gotta learn to pick it, man
I've got to pick a wedding ring
But I don't really understand if they want to do the same
Have to be, had to go
Had to move from Glassnote
I had to do my own thing, on the other side
And niggas don't understand why I gotta rhyme
I freestyle to the end of the day
People tell me "How you do it at Sway?"
And if you want a freestyle, call me up
Me and Chance in the studio, rollin' up like
"What we gonna do next week?
What we gonna do next year?
Make this shit a mixtape
Or is it album of the year?"

[Refrain]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Man, I don't know! I don't know

[Hook]
I was sayin', like
People used to count me out
People used to count me out
But people used to count me out
People used to count me out

[Verse 2]
I like your music, ain't a fan though
I like your movie, are you Lando?
I like your show, are you around tho?
You in Atlanta facing a lot, huh?
Are you in Atlanta doin' your own thing
Me and Usher in the studio
Smoking dope, rollin' up
Talkin' about what we're gon' do
I call Erykah and be like
"Yo, what you doin' tonight
Should we get on the mic like that?
Should we do somethin' new for them?"
Or do people just not like care, I mean
Sometimes I get kinda sad
I'm on twitter like, "What's bad"
I'm on twitter like, "What's good"
Me and my son in the hood, like ooh
Me and my son in the hood, like ooh
Watching daddy getting a haircut, sittin', like ooh
Watching daddy on TV, like ooh
In the living room moving to this beat, like ooh
In the living room move his little feet, like ooh
In the living room, rhythm real sweet, like ooh
We can go ahead and change the beat up, like ooh

[Bridge A]
If you know the time
We can feel it in time
In time
If you know the time
You can feel it in time
In time
Shit is feeling like the end of days
But I know this way is gonna change
It's gonna change
I feel Marvin in my heart
I feel Marvin in my heart
I feel Marvin in my heart
What's goin' on
Why are we still singing the same song
What's goin' on
Why are we still singing the same song
I hope, one day
We'll find a new song to sing
I pray, that's how it goes
Until then

[Verse 3]
I'm in the studio, hanging with the Migos
I'm sitting there looking like
People want to do that
People always want to talk me out
Count me out
People be like, "Ugh, he a nigga, stay clear"
Uh, uh, uh
And then they be like, "Nigga, oh shit
Oh shit, that's the album of the year?"
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know
I don't really got fears no more
I don't know, I don't know
I ain't really got, dreams, no more
I don't know, I don't know
I am runnin' out steam, sometimes
I be sitting down, writing like
Really, do I want this rhyme?
Should I spend more time with my son
Should I have a little more fun
With the people I think move on?
I lost people last year
Again, no
A friend though
On the phone with Fredo like
"What's up"
And then the next day I'm like
"Oh, that's what's up"
I'm a friend with Emmy like
"What's up"
And I get a call like
"That's what's up"

[Bridge B]
I feel like world's dying out
I feel like I'm running out of town
But there's nowhere I can't go
And people know your face
Like this

[Verse 4]
Yo, like with the cops
Freakin' out, walkin' in the room
That's on fire, holdin' a pizza box
I got that shit on lock though
People wanna talk top four
People run, they only move, sayin'
I ain't, got a new page to write
I am working on something I love
It's the last time
People like "put that shit out"
But it's the last time
I don't know, I don't know
If I'm ready, to end up, to end this
But I need some time tonight
To end something
Death is good
If it means progress, I confess
I got, I got
To change, rearrange, live in this phase
By the lake, sittin' by
My girl, talkin' about a world of things
Whether you gon' bring the [?]
Are you gonna drop this year
I don't really know, but I fear I will
And I know that fear, that I have, is good

[Outro]
Thank you for coming out
Love your screams and shouts
Don't mean to be a bummer
But I probably won't do Worldstar until the next summer
When I'm back in time
Please come around
Got something planned
Oh you understand now
I hope you understand now
Give it up for the band now
I really appreciate it
Thank you guys so much
