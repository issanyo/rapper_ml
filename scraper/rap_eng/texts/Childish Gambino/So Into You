[Verse 1]
With every passing moment, thoughts of you run through my head
I am slowly realizing, I think you're truly heaven-sent

[Pre-Hook]
I think you're truly something special, something my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy, there's no one like you around
Oh my

[Hook]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

[Verse 2]
Know the way you hold me, might be the things that you say
I don't know what it is boy, but I know I like feeling this way

[Pre-Hook]
I think there truly something special, just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy, there's no one like you around

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, Oh noo

[Hook]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I am so into you

I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
Really like, what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
So into you
