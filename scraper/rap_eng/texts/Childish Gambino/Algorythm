[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Super computer status
Walking alone in streets
Everyone is an addict
Know what its gonna be
What is the motivation
Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came up from the earth smelling like roses
Talkin' the new edition, made it way too efficient
Man that's a guinea pig, I did it with no permission
I told him to call a friend
Didn't tell him to listen
So very scary, so binary
Zero and one
That code is like
My cousin [?]
[?]
Not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream up with me like a hit, nah
You just don't understand
You just gon' sell a lie
You just gotta survive
We know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life isn't really worth it, the algorythm is clerical

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo) Algorythm
(Move it they say so) Algorythm

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
If you feelin' this shit, I wanna hear you say "Hell yeah"
If you feelin' this shit, wanna hear you say "Hell yeah"

[Verse: Toronto performance]
We still ballin' we still movin'
We got a million and a half and we still [?]
Everybody sayin' that we don't got enough
[When] we talk about all of that crazy stuff

The internet, the media, the information, we killin' 'em
One-by-one, two-by-two, get dragged by [?]
Nobody can tell you what to do
Nobody can tell you what to say
And everybody knows that we're only going one way
And we gon say

[Verse: Los Angeles Performance]
You're too bad for me, too slow
And where the fuck we gonna go, man nobody know
I try to speak a little bit of truth
That everybody sayin' in the booth

And everybody tell you that the same way
We got the same game with the same day
We got the same plague in the same game
And everybody looking at me saying wait

I ain't got a problem with the new school
But the shit we dealing with ain't even in the gene pool
Evolve or get left behind cuz the city is a state of mind of the Algorythm

[Verse: Atlanta Performance]
Everybody wanna feel the same way
But everybody wanna do the same thing
And if you talkin' that real bullshit, then you might as well buy that golden ring

Too many lovers
Too many colors
Too many different
Too many sinners
I got to get it
But everybody tryna listen to the same one
And everybody buys the same gun
And everybody gonna make you feel like you don't need to act like
You don't have, but you do
And this the real shit that we gon' do with this

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo) Algorythm
(Move it they say so) Algorythm

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorythm, Algorythm

[Instrumental, Preacher]
