Kill ‘em
It’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’ll be more dead than a horse head
In a four bed-
Room apartment
Bloggers that start shit
You want to criticize me?
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearing some American Apparel
While you’re staring at a Tim and Eric DVD?
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob shit: knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-Tip, or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on her neck while she buttoning up
And my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out they gotta camp out
Better than half of all rappers you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house
Hands down
Fake niggas said, “You the man now!”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Childish don’t go hard, what?
Now everybody wanna fuck with me, slut
The flow is too sick
Got them white boy clothes and that black dude dick
Now I understand why you gotta hate a nigga
East side! Stone Mountain-Decatur nigga
Y’all niggas lame, I’m fly as hell
Cause I’m fucking lame, and I don’t even care!
