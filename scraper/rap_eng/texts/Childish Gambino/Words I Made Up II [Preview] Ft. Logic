[KHEYRO]

I put in work then i puts it down
Go ahead and twerk then puts it down look
Work it, twerk it, perfect, Jodi Breeze, put it on the surface
Break that counter down, turn around
Get on top and shake the ground (ground)
Yeah just get on top and shake the ground
Hold up how you do that there ?
Big on top and a bigger derrière
Heard you gotta man but i really don’t care
All my single ladies put your hands in the air !

[Logic]

Hold up, how the hell you think i got this name
Girl i’m all about the brain why you think they call me (logic)
Okay, condom in my pocket lay on the bed let me rock it
Please don’t stop it, spit for profit, but this right here on the house
Fuck the bed, we cutting on the floor, then later on the couch
Ladies get aroused and i gets it in, make you scream and make you win
From the very beginning, the second i’m in
