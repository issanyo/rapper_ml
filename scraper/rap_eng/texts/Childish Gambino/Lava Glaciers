[Intro]
La Música de Harry Fraud

[Chorus: Nektar]
My mind goes round like a roundabout
Whistles and sings
Darker than darkest night
Sweeter than spring

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, mysterious, my mermaids are bi-curious
She done got intoxicated, her girlfriend is furious
Just in case, I pack the paper in the briefcase
Rain water, roof taste, Pistol Pete
White Louis suitcase, who can sing a hook like Franky Lymon?
Should I choose the Baywatch David Hasselhoff hair
Or the Allen Iverson braids, zigzags I'm designin'
Soft and beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup
Edge up, I done got fed up
Ate the pork chop sandwich with the tartar sauce
In the packet that I found in my purple Prada pocket protector
I could say anything about luck, you need to shut the fuck up
Like an attic door, I did pour a fourth a fourth hit of codeine
Sonic the Hedgehog cup versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup
I did, I did pour a fourth hit of codeine
Sonic the Hedgehog cup versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup
RiFF!

[Chorus: Nektar]
My mind goes round like a roundabout
Whistles and sings
Darker than darkest night
Sweeter than spring

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Nigga hold up, what is this?
We ain't supposed to be here yet, your name wasn’t on that list
We even checked the email that was sent from up above, or rather all around us
Screams in my dreams like a One Direction concert, so
We’re on our own, so alone in the universe
We sent people to the moon and now we know just the two of us
By heart, my art, I don’t wanna explain it
I knew it, he bullshit, he up his own anus
Instagrams with his fans, man, he wish he was famous
Stop talkin' about your heart, we give a fuck, entertain us
Why this nigga the lamest? Why his clothes so the plainest?
Then all the ones who hate us, are the same sayin' we made it
Man, fuck the vindicated, innovated, at least influence
How do we become the God? Language we're learning fluent
Understand who you are, they told us to be patient
But it's pointless like the use of emojis in conversation
Question mark face, what does it mean?
It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens
But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terrio
Yeah, you getting your shine, but nigga, are you eating, though?

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
If you let go of all you find
(You will) learn to love yourself, free your mind
(We are) turning into the god we love
(I will) never give up on where we're from

[Chorus: Nektar]
My mind goes round like a roundabout
Whistles and sings
Darker than darkest night
Sweeter than spring

[Outro: Nektar]
My mind expands to a great degree
A feeling that must be free
All that's left is you and me
And you're gone
