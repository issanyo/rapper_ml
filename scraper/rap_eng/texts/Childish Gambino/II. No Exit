[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Can't sleep
3 a.m., stare at the ceiling, murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate cornucopia, so be it, say I'm over it
Playing Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood
Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon
I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?
"Didn't respond when I texted you last night"
"You alright?"—yeah...

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied
When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood, so good, I'mma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it, admit it
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes
Watch some cartoons, turn off the lights
Look at the recluse, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse, look at the rec—

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Outro: Miguel]
(Don't go, don't go)
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go-ooo
