[Verse 1]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am just a rapper
Gambino keep it jumping
These niggas don't know nothing
I keep a girl shaky like her pussy lips is krumping
It's that dude that don't say shit
Leave the ad-libs at the door
Because I am just a rapper like the condoms on my floor
Nigga look at me
Man, yeah I'm all geeked out
Got the tortoise shell frames, Tom Ford pea coat
I'm a lot more dope, I'm a lot more fly
And my wallet stay fat, but I starve my tie
Yeah, these girls loose change
Gotta spend those dimes
Haven't seen real niggas in a long ass time
Nigga I'm so stange, so weird, unusual
Sipping on that whiskey, it's a brain cell funeral
I'll tell you why I'm different, I do this like a nun
Cause I don't give a fuck, I do this shit for fun
A nigga All That like I'm hanging out with Kel
Yes, I hit her g-spot, so I ring her Taco Bell
I got a lot of swagger, lets me get away with all of it
Like I ate a turd, real shit is all I nigga spit
I don't play around with these women, I might fuck a bitch
The game's a corporation and your nigga's Erin Brockovich
I'm murdering this beat as if nobody was watching me
Rapping over Grizzly Bear and now these hipsters sponsor me
My mouth is this good, just imagine what my dick can do
Force Feed Radio, bitch that's what you're listening to

[Verse 2]
My girl wears Pampers, I fuck the shit out of her
'Bout to blow up, yeah my swag is the Challenger
These Scrubs are reclusive, J.D, Salinger
March on these niggas like they fucking with the calendar
If I wasn't this good, how the fuck did I get this far?
Gambino stay fly. So up, I'm Pixar
Hold up dude, I think you made a mistake
Don't forget to mention me with Wale, Cudi and Drake bitch
