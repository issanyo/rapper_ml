[Hook]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high

[Verse 1]
What's your problem
Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time...
Girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
Cause I know

[Hook]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm s- Now I'm s-

[Verse 2]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we could be
No, no, no...

[Outro]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
Now I'm so high

And when it's said and done
We'll be on our own
(Now I'm so high)
You'll be better off
I'll be grown and gone
(Now I'm s- Now I'm s-)
And when it's said and done
We'll be on our own
(Now I'm so high)
You'll be better off
I'll be grown and gone
(Now I'm s- Now I'm s-)
(Now I'm so high)
(Now I'm s- Now I'm s-)

Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
