[Verse 1]
Life's a party, baby, do what you wanna do (whoa, ah)
It's all a party, baby, and I like to move with you
There's a rhythm, you can feel it, you my girl, then you mine
And if all you do is worry, you'll be running out of time
So what's the use, our time is ticking, what's your groove?

[Chorus]
But just remember we 'gon do it (ohh, alright)
Get in this party, baby, do it (ohh, all night)
This is a one time function (ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (ohh, all night) Ray, ugh

[Bridge]
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)

[Verse 2]
This is the party baby, I wanna move with you
Try to enjoy yourself cause it might be over soon
Lost some friends at the party, had to leave early on
But we still gon' have a good time, gonna party break of dawn
So don't be you, cause all this party needs is you

[Chorus]
But just remember we gone do it (ohh, alright)
Get in this party baby, do it (ohh, all night)
This is a one time function (ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (ohh, all night) hay-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Sign your name on the line, signature or initial
More like a get together, nothing really official
Shark attack overdose, standing next to the edge
Trying to get that picture, you ain't taking a picture
You ain't in the moment, everything that they feed you is sweet
And that sugar corny, my flavor, they can't control it
This that party you gotta move, but then you 'gon break a move

[Chorus]
But just remember they gon' do it
Get in this party, make 'em do it, baby
Baby this is a one time function, uh
Move at this party, we gon' do it
(Bring that sound in, ohh, ayo)

[Outro]
We gon' do it. get in this party, make you do it
This is a one time function, move at this party, we gon' do it
(Overtime)
We gon' do it, get in this party, make you do it (do-it-do-it-do-it)
This is a one time function
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Move at this party, we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Just remember we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Get in this party, make 'em do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
