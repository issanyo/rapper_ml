[Refrain]
You know what I did, it doesn't matter
You know that I'll always be better
Sometimes I'm crazy, and you know it
That's how I show you that I care

[Hook]
Whatever I did, girl, forget about it
Whatever I said, girl, just forget about it
Whatever I do, girl, just forget about it all night long
Yeah, oh

Everybody put your hands up
Clap them together
Clap them together for me
All night long

You know what I did
It doesn't matter
You know that I'll always be better

And you know it
That's how I show you that I care

Whatever I did, girl, forget about it
Whatever I said, girl, just forget about it
Whatever I do, girl, just forget about it all night long
Yeah, oh

You know what I did, it doesn't matter
You know that I'll always be better
Sometimes I'm crazy, and you know it
That's how I show you that I care

Whatever I did, girl, forget about it
