Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside. Yelling
VOICE
FREEZE!
GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other
**************
Dude 2 walks away fast…
More gun shots...
Two guys come in, each dragging a body. Wearing all black, from their ski masks to their boots
Dudes 1 and 2 now lay dead in front of The Boy
Guy 1: All the drugs and all the money, now!
The Boy: Those guys took everything I had and put it in a bag
Guy 2 leaves to go find the bag. The Boy thought there was something strange about these guys, the way they walked and talked. They were obviously trying to disguise their voices, but something else was off about them
The Boy: Can I have my phone?
Guy 1: I don’t have your phone
The Boy: I know, but he does
The Boy nodded to Dude 1
Guy 1 got The Boy’s phone out of Dude 1’s pocket and tossed it to him
The Boy: And he has my wallet
The Boy nodded to Dude 2
Guy 1 got The Boy’s wallet, took all the money he had in it and tossed it to him
The Boy: Thanks a lot (Sarcastically)
Guy 1: No problem, you’re going to die anyway
Guy 2 comes back with the bag
Guy 1: Do we have everything?
Guy 2: Yep
The Boy: So now what?
Guy 2: I don’t think you need me to tell you you’re an awful dealer
Guy 1 laughs, but it wasn’t a guy’s laugh. They both remove their masks. Females. Naomi and Another Girl
Naomi: You make everything feel awkward. You can't connect with anyone. How is anyone supposed to feel like they can trust you?
Both girls smile and aim their guns
The Boy: Why?
Naomi: Because the internet...
4 Shots
The Boy receives a text from Fam, breathing his last breath he reads, “Don’t trust Naomi.”
