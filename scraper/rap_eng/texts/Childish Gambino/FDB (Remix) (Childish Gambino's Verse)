East side, Zone 6, where I'm from
Got a couple hundreds I'mma throw 'em like ones
Fuck her with a rubber, I ain't tryna have sons
Nigga mean-mugging, they don't really want none
Fuck it, I'm turnt up, too loud
Ratchet bitches won't do me I'm like "What the hell I'mma do now?"
I'm rich, used to be poor
I don't really trust 'em if I met 'em on tour
Bought a new house livin' on the top floor elevator go bing when you at the front door
I ain't ever do chores, i ain't takin' your trash, i ain't made no beds got a maid with an ass
Put em on blast, i don't give a fuck
Got a bad bitch like she peed on the rug
Yeah i used to live of Candler, in 88 like piano
I put ya girlfriend on camera
I see the future, ciara
Molly all in her champagne, she knew it
Big sean and big moms, i do it
Fuck that bitch with a broken dick, i love my new girl
She don't talk shit she don't act extra
She just give brain and the brain so MENSA
Put her in the game but a nigga might bench her
I don't pay attention, i don't even text her
She wanna talk shit, but damn on our friendship
Fuck you bitch and i hope you're offended; bitch!
