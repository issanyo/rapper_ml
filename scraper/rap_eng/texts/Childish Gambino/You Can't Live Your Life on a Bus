VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

It was only instinct

The Boy dives for the ground, making an [O_O EMOJI] face

Gun shots are ringing through his ear. Dude 2 is screaming

The Boy was crawling

Dragging himself across the floor pathetically, out the door

He was running now, past the pool, away from the mansion

VOICE: You have to help me! Please help me! Please... Please help me!

The voice was fading

THE BOY: I didn't sign up for this shit... I didn't want any of this..

The Boy falls against the grass, too tired to run anymore

He had barely escaped death, he was going to jail after this

After everything he had done
Everything he hadn't

THE BOY: I'm supposed to be the troll... I'm Bill O'Reilly.. but life's the biggest troll

THE BOY was crying now, making the [ :'( EMOJI ] face

THE BOY (CONT'D): and the joke is on us

{We don't have to do anything}

{Yeah. Isn't that sad?}

THE BOY: my dad's dead, my friends aren't here, cos' they don't care

The Boy curled up against the grass, face sad, regretful

This was the end

THE BOY (CONT'D): i'll never see naomi again. i won't get to find out what roscoe's wetsuit means
I miss my dad. i miss.. my mom, i miss being happy. i miss being.. childish

Police sirens were getting louder. The reinforcements had arrived

Laying against the ground, THE BOY began to mumble

THE BOY: Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

VOICE: I FOUND HIM

What's the point? I don't know

Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?

I need you

You have to help me
