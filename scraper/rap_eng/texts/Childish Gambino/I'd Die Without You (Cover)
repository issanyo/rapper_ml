[Verse 1]
Is it my turn, to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything

Is it my turn, to hold you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and I hear you
Is it my turn to totally understand?
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

[Hook]
If I have to give away the feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice, whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
‘Cause inside i’d die without you
Oh Oh baby I’d die without you
Die without you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I apologize for all the things I’ve done
But now I’m underwater and I’m drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry
Isn’t it amazing how some things completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart
Piece of my heart
Take every little piece of my soul
Piece of it
Take every little piece of my mind
Cause if you don't
Inside

[Hook]
I’d die without you
Die without you
Yeah baby
Die without you

[Verse 3]
If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
Yeah If I have to sacrifice
Oh, whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
‘Cause inside

I’d die without you
Die without you
Cause inside
I’d die without you
Die without you
Oh no
Die without you
Oh, I apologize for all the things I’ve done
But now I’m underwater and I’m drowning


Thanks
