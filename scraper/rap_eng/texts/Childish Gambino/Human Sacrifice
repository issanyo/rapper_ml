[Intro]
Why go to the party
Why go to the party
Why go to the party at all
Two shots and a body
Two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved
Where are those summer men
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls
Who corrected, [saved women?]
I'm sorry
Forgiven

I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness

Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely
Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely
Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark

I hope and pray that we are together
No matter the weather
I get lost sometimes
I hope and pray that we are together
No matter the weather
It's so hard to find

I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness

Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely
Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely
Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark

I hope and pray that we are together
No matter the weather
I get lost sometimes
I hope and pray that we are forever
No matter the weather
It's so hard to find

Holy spirit
Do you hear me?
Do you love me?
Can you hold me up?
Oh great spirit
Do you see me?
Do you love me?
Can you hold me up?

[Outro]
Spirit
Hear me
Love me
Lift me up
