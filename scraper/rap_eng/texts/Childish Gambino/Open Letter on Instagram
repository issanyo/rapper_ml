I'm afraid of the future
I'm afraid my parents won't live long enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared my girl will get pregnant at not the exact time we want
I'm scared I'll never reach my potential
I'm afraid she's still in love w/ that dude

I feel like I'm letting everyone down
I'm afraid people hate who I really am

I'm scared I'll be Tyrese
I'm afraid Dan Harmon hates me
I'm scared I won't know anything ever again
I'm scared I never knew anything
I'm afraid I'll regret this
I'm afraid this doesn't matter at all

I've seen a bunch of people die this year

But I'm not on that
Kept looking for something to be in with
