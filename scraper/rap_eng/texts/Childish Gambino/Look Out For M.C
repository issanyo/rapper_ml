Alamo, Alamo, I fell twice at the Alamo
Holes all in my soul but I don't sew em up, let the ink just flow
And stain the page, embracing pain so y'all will know, vamonos
Spain had raped so I could go, better run and hide from Columbus' ghost
If your native tongue is native, fuck what your sayin, this is our land now, ho
You will now speak our language, give us your food, and suck our dicks, ho
Southern Outcasts gonna outlast, ho, I ain't come here just to make you say "whoa"
I wanna make you watch me die, just to resurrect in a sec,, and then flow
Something like the Nile in a cascade over Dallas in a mad rage, feelin the power
As i crash waves into Reunion Tower, that'd be a sight, pick the shit up
Use it as the mic, Texas my stage, you are my audience, turn on my lights
As i body this, fightin til they're red on some commie shit, gettin green, dbz, ya some Kami shit
South side, outside, tryna break in, nows the time
No waitin, thousand rhymes gon pound the door and i am sure
That it's breakin, popcorn for the motion picture
That i'm paintin, moving and evading, the snakes in
The front yard so i must guard and pray to God for my next step
And i stay grounded, ain't no running, man fuck catching the next jet
Only exception is when rising, eclipsing greatness above horizons
The sunset at my back, casting shadows yet still blinding
I see that they will prolly never believe that, whether I am honest I gotta promise to be that
Bring back some kinda faith cuz we need that, gotta pray and say it i can't delay it or leave that
Hanging, on a crumbling word, gotta make reality gotta make it a verb
Ain't sentimentality, this my duty, my turd, my shit, my life, no flush or wipe
My blood, my tears, my love, my fears, manifested in flames and translated to ears
One breath, makes my life force clear and the day I quit only means I'm near my
Death, and the clouds'll turn, gray like the day my world was bestowed
June 26th i became me, oh, Leo, if it rains it'll be a symphony
Of green notes likely, bite me i'm cancerous
This crab meat; you can't handle this, spice me, hook your lip
Like a Pisces, had to say this, couldn't wait man i laugh at patience
Hospitals can't wait to take me, look out for M.C
