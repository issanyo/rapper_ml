These guys aren't tough and stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause i put them there
And i got a Hot Chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that i have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like i'm into this
These niggas never did shit different, i was tired of it
See the other side of it, hate how they say how
Hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could i ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And i go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause i had to, now a nigga like to
Cause i get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, crush niggas like i'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me
Good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes i stay weird and fuck chicks like i'm gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and i'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, i'ma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own toothbrush
I really think i like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah i feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah I feel myself hard like both hands

(Throw the phone out the window)
(If you want the neighbours woke)
(You'll have to shout out loud)
(And set the bed alight and slow)
(If you want the neighbours woke)
(You'll have to shout even louder)

This is all fun yeah, my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, i can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an Animal Collective
Fuckin with you raw like i don't need protection
I am just a rapper, i'm in search of perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tale, i earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause i don't talk, yeah i fight Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah i got paper like i just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga, have a hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, i'ma change it all up
Doctor knows i'm sick dude, i don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird souffl√©[?!] and the noise make me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause i'm McFly and it's not what i'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster[?]
Sky is the limit like a jet pack booster
Fuckin with a nigga like he fuckin with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga, motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker i'm a rapper
