[Intro: Kilo Kish and Donald Glover]
So, what are you doing after work tonight?
Uhh...[?] in town, so I was thinking about hanging with him
Oh, um 'cause I was thinking that we could, like, go somewhere...
Well, I reallyâ€”I feel like I don't get to see him and he's only in town for a couple of days
Yeah, yeah, yeah, um...that's understandable but...
Don't be mad
I mean...
You're mad
But, like, why wouldn't I be?
You're mad. Don't get mad

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
The sun moves close dusty yellow gold
You breathe so slow, waking up your bones
Coffee's dark
Just the way you like
Our New York Times on the Business side
Been thinkin this boy you know I kind of miss
Spontaneity of life
Cause this routine, it gets
Kinda old, kinda soon
I know we say it, but we never do
Nothing, I'm here to say something
The walls are closing in
Feels like my soul's collecting with
Dust and dew
Been waiting up for you
But our table's set
To feed me nothing new

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
Why don't you surprise me?
Why don't you surprise me?
Why don't you surprise me?

[Outro: Kilo Kish & Childish Gambino]
Boy you never try
I know, I know
6 o'clock, here you come
I know, I know
Have dinner, go to the bed
I know, I know
Sitting up alone
I know, I know
And drinking wine to the head
