[Hook]
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you

You see the world world, world, feeling—

[Interlude]
"Now, capitalism, of course, can allow for living [?]
But they can't create jobs for our people
And they're resorting to fascist techniques more and more
Fascist techniques suppressing our rightful demand
Say nothing of eradicating the individualistic, repetitive racist mentality of people in this country
Only after I feel the distribution of the wealth in this country
Only after we eradicate the exportation of man by man
Can we begin to build a humane society"
You

[Hook]
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling—

[Hook]
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
