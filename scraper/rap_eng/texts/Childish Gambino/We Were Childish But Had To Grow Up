       Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside

       Yelling

       VOICE: FREEZE!

       GUNSHOTS

       The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

Just then, Dude 2 gets shot in the chest

The Boy dives for the ground. A minute later the gunshots stop
The Boy looks around as Fam comes out from behind a truck

Fam: That was close. I knew you didn’t have it in you to deal with this kind of thing
The Boy walks towards the body of Dude 1 and grabs his phone. He realizes that his phone was on and recording the whole confrontation
Fam: You recorded everything? You going to post that up too?
The Boy: Nah...
The Boy deletes the audio clip from his phone
Fam: Let me give you a ride back to your place
The Boy: Nah...take me with Naomi

The Boy realizes he still has the video clip of the guy at the club dying. He deletes it. Then he proceeds to delete his Twitter (thegoldmolar)
