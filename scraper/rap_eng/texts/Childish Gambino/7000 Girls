[Intro: Kent Jamz]
6996, 6997, 6998, 6999, woah

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I think I slept with about 7000 girls
I think I slept with about 7000 girls
I ain't bragging
It ain't attractive
I ain't bragging baby
It ain't attractive

[Kent Jamz]
I remember popping your new girlfriend's cherry
Bumping the Carter 3
You took her to the bridge
I took her virginity
I don't need no more enemies
I gotta tell the truth
Fucked her in my backseat
Ate her out she gave me head too

[Childish Gambino]
Used to love smashing
Poetic nigga so she chase passion
Throwing feelings in my songs that she love catching
From the windows to the walls, skeet skeet action
Mmmm, I'll get the towel
My car like wow, my girl like wow
But if I charm another, she go buck wild
Check the profile
Tell me how you wanna let the chips fall
Cause you know I'm fucking and I won't call
Bino too real, Bino too real
Ain't got no chill, ain't got no chill
At the festival, the top of the lineup
He still need a line up
His clothes not designer
We don't have to be sad no more
We don't have to fuck girls on tour
We ain't gotta make moves like this
Now we only hang with bad ass chicks
Who smoke bad ass weed
And wanna listen to music and chill..
And hangout.. thats all

[Hook]

[Joon]
Well uh
My journey started off [?]
Seventeen years old when I lost my virginity
So what, I was kinda late
Thought I was doing something
'til I went to Arizona State
Do you remember the joy you had first time you nutted on the face?
Trinidad James sound effect
Started pantomiming what the porns do
Shout out to all the chicks I hit in my Hassayampa dorm room
Got my own spot that said [?] with my nigga Chuck [?]
I had the blue Tahoe, he had the red Charger on them dubs too
So of course them hoes would come through
Nineteen with high dreams and dough too
I was living comfortable as the doctor shows you
Getting head from girls while I'm trying to get they sister
Plus I had blue [?] on deck, so you know what was in my system
Fucked some girls I'm glad I did
And some girls I'm glad I didn't
I fucked so many bitches, a nigga should've been pimping
Fell in love with a one night stand
Call me the one night man
Never learned how to treat a lady 'til I loved you

[King Chip]
I need a bed big enough to fit 200 bitches
I fucked some broke bitches, I fucked bitches with riches
I had some hoes fuck me just cause my perspective cold
She fucked me cause I'm in that Black Jesus episode
She fucked me cause she want a chance at being on display
She want that Kim K, Amber testimony everyday
She want that 'rari and that condo on Rodeo
I'm a run the lettuce separate
She gone pump the mayo
She out here recruiting, she interviewing
She ask them if they [?] or shooting
Put that work and nothing to it
I say,"Oh, this yo jam, well we should be nutting to it."
I say, "Oh, this yo jam, and we should be cutting to it."

[Hook]

[Sleazy]
See I like black girls, and them Puerto Ricans
Them independent chicks that only party on the weekends
I got like four ex's: they all caught me cheating
A couple did me shady, but that ain't why we ain't speaking
Now they got boyfriends, they trying to treat 'em decent
I got a chick from Vegas, man she like keeping secrets
Only hit me on the weekends, talking dirty when we texting
Like, "Do you remember the time in the back of my mommas Lexus?"
Sure I do, when I gave you that pearl necklace
Got stains all on the leather acting so reckless
I love them ghetto girls, but fucking hate the drama
Lie and say they allergic to condoms, trying to be my baby mama
7000 girls but they all the same mayne
Tell you that they love you
I swear they run the game mayne
You really wasting time if you're trying to understand
Just beat that pussy up and send em on they way

[Hook]
