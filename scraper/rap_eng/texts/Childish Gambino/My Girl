[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Girl I make you come fast, I mean come right over
Yes a nigga so street, call a nigga Grover
Hit it like I'm supposed to, love it when you're smiling
Except when you're not smiling giving my dick oral hygene
Girlfriend you know me, I'm all about my benjamins
But you stay sweet like an ever-lasting entenmann
Girfriend center them geniuses, that's me
Talking bout in and out with a girl named ashely
Jessica, Tamika, alison, stacy
Why does every girl in the world wanna date me?
Specially right now man, specially when I'm busy
Tell me that they love me, then they try to kiss me
Baby don't you see me? Knee-deep in that dope game
Meaning that I'm dope mane, hotter than that propane
Hotter than that propane, yes I said it twice dude
Always on the move I love the Journey like a white dude
Yes I know I'm quite rude, arrogant as alva
But I have the decency to back all of my words up
So let's not pretend like every girl don't wanna be ya
You can be my Ms. Obama minus Sasha and Maliya ugh!

[Chourus: ?]
You make me feel, feel so shiny and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And the magic moment feels so right
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you oooh!

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Why you always mad at me, I was gon come right back
Fucking with them fly girls, that was only chit chat
It's part of my job, yes I'm young and charming
And I smell like money so these girls are all up on me
Let's have bygones be bygones, they don't know what they're doing like a cylon
Trying to get my python, you can check my iphone
Rolodex Gchat
When you come over all I ask is "Where my V at?"
Like I work at APC, look at me rambling
You can be a pimp, these girls making money but they'll never make sense
Half of yall crazy, the other half trying to get their paper having babies
Naw I ain't down with that "Hooohh!" like a thundercat
Try to poke holes in the base where I keep soldiers at
Sneaky like a Cheshire cat, sneaky like a baby sneaker
One of these girls got my number I ain't trying to meet her
Yes you are fine Anita, but I ain't trying to be the
Father of five you need to find a new guy or either
Step it up 2, but you are not Cassie
Cause you have full head, I mean you're smart nasty

[Chourus: ?]
You make me feel, feel so shiny and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And the magic moment feels so right
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you oooh!\

Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl...
