I just want to take, um a little time cuz, some people said they listen to the first album and they didn't know what I was talking about when I was like talking about like "Lightsabers" and shit so, I want to let you know like my lingo what I'm saying is "Lightsaber" means; A brightly colored hoody. Um, that you wear usually at night, like a neon green or pink or yellow or something bright that you know people, it catch people eye you know, you can you know. I- you can also say you know shoes are "Lightsabers" as well, shoes are "Lightsabers" as well, um if you will but usually, it's a lightly colored hoody of some sort. Um, Fly, fly, if you don't know what Fly or Phat means, you're either 8 or 80 cuz you guys should, you should know what that means, it means cool, it means tight, it means you know fly, it just means fly. I don't how to describe it you know if you look in the dictionary under "Fly" it would be like; Fly. definition, Fly, you should know this. That what the definition would be. Um, Sick, Sick Boi, Sick Boi, is just you know a dude who you know dresses in Sick Boi articles of clothing such as "Lightsabers", you know um"2k's" which you know are just (?) like chapstick jeans, you know um, you know feeling themselves jerkin' you know, all that lingo shit, um yeah, that's me.
