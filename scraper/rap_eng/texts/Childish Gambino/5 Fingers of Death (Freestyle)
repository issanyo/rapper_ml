[Intro: Sway]
DJ Wonder
We gon' rock at least 5 beats, to show your versatility
What you're made of
You gotta rock 5 back, aiight?
Here we go. Childish Gambino, let's go

[Verse 1]
As the world's turnin', I feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurtin', from all of its work cursin'
And I'm not certain I think my father's Lavar Burton
'Til I'm walkin' in circles and I'm talkin' in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper mach√©
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Cause shit, ain't nothin' changed
I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin'
I can prove it
I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I've been writin' these verses while I'm havin' a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom, crankin' No Doubt and Staring Back
Stereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally, wondering why they won't let me in
I'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin
Fuck it, let me get to the next beat

[Verse 2]
I'm the nerdiest rapper ever
I'm wearing a Cosby sweater
And reading Oscar Wilde
Ripping my foreskin to make a washable condom
A bunch of assassins tried to jump me
They couldn't touch me
I rolled off in a yellow Humvee with a bunch of monkeys
My taste buds hate fudge, man
Plus I'm allergic
I'mma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis on purpose
And girls see my dick size and they realize
That they can't handle it
I get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam... Anderson?
With my du-rag in my left hand
And my iPod and my diskman
I get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damm
And I'm still spittin', I'm still hittin'
Big pimpin' like Hova
Yo, let me be the rap...run over
Yea, lemme go, lemme go

[Verse 3]
Childish Gambino, yo this off the dome
I gotta keep it goin' cause I came from home
Come from Rome, Athens
Or Atlanta, Georgia
Got somethin' for ya
Yes I got some s'mores cause I'll boil you
Like I got that Goya
You know how they play Reggaeton in the beats
When you in NYC
Meaning that me and I'm sickest
Yo, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters Like Ickis
Yo, this chick that I used to lick it
Now her name Aubrey Plaza
I didn't mean to kick it while I'm gettin' salsa
Like I'm eatin' salsa, cause she Puerto Rican
Some people speakin' like she ain't white
But you know that's alright 'cause I keep it tight

[Verse 4]
Nerdy word murderer in a purple convertiber
Niggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him
Bitch niggas is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all
Like all these niggas wanna bone cause you datin' dogs
Or why the radio used to not play me
And why does every white girl love ukelele?
Where I'm from, the Jesus piece couldn't save me
And I'm still spittin' shit cause I'm gettin' like gravy
Eatin' like mashed potatoes, I hate those
Haters who say that I'm not black enough
Yo, you ain't wack enough to fuckin' touch my MC mic
You better keep it tight
Eat a dick like you starvin' homie

[Verse 5]
Yo, on this last beat I'mma goner
Gotta spit over somethin' hard, like Nirvana
And I'm crazy
With the beat when it comes to this spittin' it
Shittin' it, while I'm lickin' it
I ain't even need to get it
Man these other unC's, they need to get it
Why this LL Cool J shit
Yo I got pesos and mesos
Meaning I can only hack with they ghost
When they go there, when I go back
And I'm still that, I ain't backpack
But you know, with the fuck the rest
Yo they say that is lame like Johnye West
Or Kanye West
But I ain't Kanye West
I'm just tryin' to stay the truth
And I ain't tryin' to spit the truth
Yo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway
Shay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin'
