How
Fast
Can a heart shatter?
Before
You're
Walking on splinters
Your head
Aches
Just
To feel what it knows
Please leave the light on when you go
Please leave the light on when you go

How
Can
You fix something
That you
Can't
Touch without hurting
The
Lesson
You've learned
Is leaving you dumb
Please leave the light on when its done
Please leave the light on when its done

Standing
High above
Floodline
Watching
All your belongings go by
Go by (3x)
Go
Go home
Go home bye go home
Go by
Go by

[?]
Watch it fly (6x)
...
Watch it fly

How
Can
You see the ending
When you're lost
At the beginning
The day takes all that the night left behind
Please leave the light on when it dies
Please leave the light on when it dies
