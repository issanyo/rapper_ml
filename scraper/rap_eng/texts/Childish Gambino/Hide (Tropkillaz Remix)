Childish Gambino... Tropkillaz Remix...
N.A.S.A....
Hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide, hide, hide, hide my love

[Bridge: Tropkillaz]
Ayo, I love you more than any, yelling money on my mind
Anytime I think about you I just wanna press rewind
I don't know what I would ever do, don't like to think about it
Cause I'm turning up the volume to eleven on the dial
Yo, I love you more than any, yelling money on my mind
Anytime I think about you I just wanna press rewind
I don't know what I would ever do, don't like to think about it
Cause I'm turning up the volume to eleven on the dial

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
World, this is all me
You were drunk and just turnin' up like a car key
And I was high, just tryin' to eat some pommes frites
Don't you know I hold baby down like a car seat?
The R&B, just listenin' to some Carl T
The city cold, but we make it hot likes it's Palm Beach
You stick it out so now your ass is in arm's reach
Tell them niggas the flow colder than RC
Pardon me, I got way too much on my mental, you number two like a pencil
I'm number one like a winner, you number one like beginner
I like 'em when they be thicky, but help her out if she thinner
I give her D for that dinner then play it left like it's Tinder, swipe
I get it, I'm a weird ass nigga, right?
But I'm feelin' like a weird ass nigga's your type
We should fuck in an aquarium...
(Turnin' up the volume to eleven on the dial)

[Turntablism: Childish Gambino, Tropkillaz]
We should fuck, right?
Turning up the volume to eleven on the dial


[Hook: Anyzli Jones]
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna hide, hide, hide, hide my love

[Bridge: Tropkillaz]
Yo, I love you more than any, yelling money on my mind
Anytime I think about you I just wanna press rewind
I don't know what I would ever do, don't like to think about it
Cause I'm turning up the volume to eleven on the dial
Yo, I love you more than any, yelling money on my mind
Anytime I think about you I just wanna press rewind
I don't know what I would ever do, don't like to think about it
Cause I'm turning up the volume to eleven on the dial
