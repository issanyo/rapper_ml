Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up
There's a small crash outside

Yelling

VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

FATHER miraculously shows up in the doorway, larger than life, with an M-16 in one hand and a white tiger on a leash in the other. The tiger mauls Dude 2 to death

FATHER (Rick Ross)
Boy, what did I tell you 'bout fucking around with these cops?! Dope game ain't made for brothas like you

THE BOY
Figured I can learn from the internet like everything else I've ever done. You were never there. It's all I had and all I ever needed. You think coming in here and saving my ass will make up for lost time? Fuck that. This all I got

FATHER motions the boy over with outstretched arms. Looking for some sort of appreciation for saving his son's life. THE BOY smugly denies the motion of affection

THE BOY
Don't play dad with me now! Too late for this fuckery. I'm packing my shit-

BANG!

FATHER kills his white tiger and now has his gun aimed at THE BOY

FATHER
You unappreciative sack of shit. Should've left you in your mama's mouth, boy

THE BOY dives for Dude 2's pistol which is now lying covered in blood on the floor. FATHER fires, misses and realizes he must reload. THE BOY steadies his shot as FATHER now has a full clip. THE BOY's phone is prone on the floor, somehow filming the action

BANG BANG!!

Two bodies drop. ZOOM shot of FATHER's bloody hand reaching for the phone. He shuts off the video and clutches his chest as THE BOY slowly pulls his bloody self up off the floor, pistol in hand

SCREEN goes black

THE END
