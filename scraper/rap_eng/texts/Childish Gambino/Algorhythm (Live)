(Opening)
As we stand together
From this hill
That will the children
That we must be free

Then with no joy in the summer
The truth untold
And the cruel among us
Our tired and old

Mother
In feel your tears
Why do you mourn
I never made it home

Can you feel it oh
Do you see me oh
A voice keeps on telling me
That we got to be
And we have to be
Free

Are you ready Atlanta?
Ay, Ay, Ay
You still with me?
Are you ready?

(Verse 1)
Super computer status
Walking along streets
Everyone is invited
Mo one is gon’ be
Open to (?)
Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came long on the earth smelling like roses
I’m on the new edition
Y’all ain’t the new addition
Made us the guinea pig and did with it no commission
I told him to call a friend
Told him not to listen
Too very scary
Too [?]
Zero to one
I cut this mic, [?]

(Chorus)
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo) Algorithm
(im gon hope they say so) Algorithm

(Verse 2)
If you feeling this shit I wanna say hell yeah (hell yeah)
If you feeling this shit wanna hear you say hell yeah (hell yeah)

(Chorus)
Everybody move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorithm, Algorithm
