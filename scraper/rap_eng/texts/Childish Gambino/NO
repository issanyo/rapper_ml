[Verse 1:](Sensei)

Don't you know we run this
Come up and run this hundred
Run it like you got the stash, and the Headlights all on ya ass

You runnin' outta gas
Dogs comin' to attack
Heli got the beams
Red dots on ya' back
Shot it on the Seam
Aim like he hittin' glass

[Verse 2:](Samarai)

Double homicide nigga, like I'm OJ
Only ever fuck a beat when it consents it's ok
I'm a great rapper mhm, yeah, you don't say?
Know I'm takin' off like students when it's a snow day

Nothing else compares to me my nigga, no cold play
Your career is dirty and broke down, like some old jays
I'm just tryna figure out how you niggas is so lame
Transfer all my bars? You gon' need a fuckin road train

I keep bringin that hot fire
Itll come together like cross wire, don't get caught in that cross fire
Cuz you gon' melt, when we get lit, you a big bitch, like rottwilers
I'll pile drive ya to the fuckin ground, cuz I don't wanna hear another fuckin sound from

You niggas, cut you off like rude scissors
Tired of hearin bout all ya money, & it's all just funny cuz you ain't shit
Just another nigga tryna run shit, guess you could say I'm just anotha guy
But I'll keep it real, while that otha nigga, just filled you up, with anotha lie

[Verse 3:](Sensei)

Another lie, another crime that's crystalline for the imbecile that's demoralized
The more i rise, the more they ride
I pray they collide with automobiles
I come equipped to the feet
You come equipped for defeat
Now Bow on ya' knees and plead for mercy
But don't plead for a Merci
You'll curse me with these luxuries
I don't want these golds right next to me
We lose z's just to get to a to b
Just to earn Ms, like we eat godly
Good golly almighty
You'll might meet a ripley
Believe it or not
I'm a rare breed of MCs

[Verse 4:] (Sensei)

Thought I was done?
I'm ricked up with all these written guns
It's Me against the world, take 'em on one by one, Scott Pilgrim
If you pull the wrong pin, you spill ya' ink
Lose ya' life in a flash, homie don't blink
Tomorrow never promised, now let that sink
Calm down, I'm at my brink

You're detrimental mental won't understand what comes off of this pencil
You're level stuck on fundamentals, Im identical to the originals
It's critical that I reach my pinnacle, so my goals become physical
Now watch me deviously take over the whole business ho
