[Hook (MARS)]
I swear I'm spittin' til the Sun up
(til the Sun up)
If you ain't liking what we doing nigga shut up
(nigga shut up)
Let me see you do it better! OK. Enough!
(OK enough)
Knew you was whack
Fall back
I'm on the Come Up

[VERSE 1: MARS]
I lean like Jay-Z in the Range
I'm crazy and deranged
These words just come off my brain
And they flowing non stop like veins
I'm psycho I go insane
These hoes is screaming my name
While grabbin' all on my chains
(Sike) I'm kidding, I'm only playing
Wait. Hold up. These niggas said you hot?
Cause I see about ten niggas,your best friend and
Girlfriend said you're not
(So what) Im here to take your spot
And flow infinitely off the top
And I'm from my city known as the ROC
So please please tell me who gon' stop us
They call me Mars
Bars is way beyond the stars
Swear I'm tryna' make it far but this rap shit is so bizarre
One minute they say they love you the next minute you is garb
So here's a middle finger to the critics that's hating hard
And I'm here to stay like tattoos on top of statues
I go bananas! I'm crazy! I'm nuts like cashews! (uh)
I heard that flow last week and you gon' front like that's you? (uh)
OK! That's cool. Lets play it off!
I ain't even mad at you cause...

[Hook X 2]
I swear I'm spittin' til the Sun up
(til the Sun up)
If you ain't liking what we doing nigga shut up
(nigga shut up)
Let me see you do it better! OK. Enough!
(OK enough)
Knew you was whack
Fall back
I'm on the Come Up

[VERSE 2: MAN$A KUMA]
C.R.E.A.M C.R.E.A.M C.R.E.A.M get the money!
You playing with murder nigga I am Ted Bundy
And she handle my carrot like she's Bugs Bunny
Now all I see is green like I am the clay Gumby
Profit, moving, up, while you listen
Tryna' get to Queens and stack them Grants, Ulysses
I'm on the come up with your mistress
You call her Mrs
She chill with Misfits
Talking 'bout she miss us
I'm just playing throwing disses
Niggas sleeping on me, futon
Will I get that bread? Them croutons?
Being heard matters most
I'm sicker than Bubonic plague
Chronic Lyrical can't read me phonics
Can't wait 'til I blow up, atomic
I'll feel free when I can get them chains Ironic?
Dudes act Heavy but don't do diddly, Pun
Ill have 'em diddly diddly done
I do these riddles for fun!
Can't belittle me, Stuart
I got more bars than crazy Stewart
Niggas think they ludicrous
Tell 'em who the hell KUMA is!
(OOAH)
