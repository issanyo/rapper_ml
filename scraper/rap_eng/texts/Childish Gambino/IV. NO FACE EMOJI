Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside

Yelling

VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

Dude 2 immediately ducks out of the nearest window as shots continue to rain down outside. The Boy takes a peek out of the front door. There he sees Dude 1 behind a bullet ridden Phantom, and what appears to be a teenage boy with blood gushing from his dome. 2 cops are shielded behind their cars, as the firefight with Dude 1 continues. The Boy freezes in his tracks

Whats the point?
Why am I Here?
Why am I alive?
Why should anyone care?

The sounds of the world begin to seem muted and hazy

The Boy turns to walk out to the backyard. His life begins to play in reverse. He walks by a TV showing what seems to be an episode of “Homicide: Life on the Street”. A worn out Yaphet Kotto flashes across the screen dodging gunshots, before the screen suddenly changes to a commercial advertising “ROSCOES WETSUIT”

Stepping outside, The Boy still lost in his mind, wades into the pool

Whats the point?

ROSCOES WETSUIT

…Now knee deep in the water

Why am I here?

ROSCOES WETSUIT

…Up to his chest in the water, he barely notices

Why am I alive?

ROSCOES WETSUIT

…Completely submerged in the pool

Why should anyone care?

ROSCOES WETSUIT

…The world slowly fades away from a blur, to pitch black…


The Boy groggily wakes up in a hospital. Above him is his ex. She smirks and cracks a joke, “So you still wanna be my baby daddy?”…
