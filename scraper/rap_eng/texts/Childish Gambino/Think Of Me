[Verse 1]
It's that D-O double 'Bino
Nigga, how you livin'? Yeah, my life so cappuccino
Bittersweet, I'm giving everything I got, I feel so
Helpless, help us, shopping at the Gelson's: soymilk, shellfish
Used to stunt Kitsune, used to date Katsumi
But then I got a new one, but she ain't talking to me
IMessages unread, pain that was unsaid
Laughter that we ain't heard from children we ain't had
I'm a boss, homie. Die a boss like I'm Steve Jobs
They thought I was Jamaican, I got three jobs
They must have been mistaken, I ain't feel ya
They respect the grind and zone 6 lookin' real soft
Dear Mom, you sound sick every time I call
Dad's lying to me, I can hear it in his tone
I don't want nobody help, leave me the fuck alone
Brother holding my head in the shower don't know what I'm on
Rivers running through my nappy afro
Feeling guilty, won the raffle
But the lotto ate my motto at my core
I'm just an apple and they want me PC
Paid for my house but this show is not me
More than the music, we going for that mastery overload
Da Vinci Code comatose to sport a beard like I'm OVO
Got that cream, I'm an Oreo
You know how the story goes
DatPiff four page cause you suck something glory hole
It's that Fresh Prince, Royalty means you deserve it
We were best friends, they talking bout him and I
They loving this silly guy, I'm popping Abilify
Niggas was wildin' out cause they want me so civilized
They say anytime that you getting cheese you in a rat race
Any movies that they offer me is black face
It's so post racial, so I can't prove it
We the same thing, we in the same movement
Business is business, we eating lunch, just not on silent
It's the Diddy and Biggie driving backwards, I'm so iconic
If I'm dead before Detox it doesn't mater, I heard The Chronic
You gon' sell it on eBay, just be glad that I fuckin' signed it
I ain't mad, though, you gotta eat, right?
I know your voice, man, you Marshall Lee, right?
Nah, I'm what you hear in your dreams saying it's not enough
God had made a lot of land, I gotta buy it up
I'm bouncing on the highway, blast it in my driveway
Put that shit on replay, turnt up on agave
Check the kimosabe, my life is so behind me
If you ain't feeling it, come and find me
Come and find me

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm so on to you
I'm so on to you
I'm on to you
