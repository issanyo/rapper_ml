As we stand together
Promise me
That we'll teach the children
That we must be free
There is no joy in sorrow
No truth untold
And the cruel above us
Are tired and old

Mother infinity
Why do you go, away from me?

Do you see me?

A voice keeps on telling me
That we've got to be
That we have to be
Free
