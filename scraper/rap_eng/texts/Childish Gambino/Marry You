[Chorus]
Well, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

[Verse 1]
Well I know at little chapel by the boulevard that we can go
No one will know oh oh oh
Come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

[Outro]
I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oh
So what you want to do?
Let's just run girl
