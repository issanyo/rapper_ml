[Intro] (On Radio)
Power 106!
LA it's your girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand new music
I need you to turn it up
And let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland"
On Power 106

I was making Japanese
And she's watch-
*Radio tuning*
Josh Smith, check him out-
*Radio tuning*
So now the fans are gonna be all over Josh Smith-
*Radio tuning*

Verse 1 [Josh Smith] (On Radio)
Just a kid from the 408
Writin' raps at home, just tryna make it in the Golden State
He's from the burbs and talk so white, so how's he lookin' like an ape?
Wait stop the tape, where's the 808?
Alright, now this beat is bumpin' like some high school seniors after
Prom
They yelling, "This my song!" Yeah, this track is like Al Queda bomb
Now my mic is meltin', yeah, it's smokin' up just like a bong
When following your passion, there's no way that you can do it wrong
What's going on? I don't know. I spit it raw, that's how I flow
And my only speed is go, no slowin' down, I gots to go
Nonstop headin' down this road until I'm número uno
Goin' coast to coast with sold out arenas at every show
I do it big, I'm from the bay, the biggest thing since the Mac Dre
Sure he had his Thizzle but I sizzle each and every day
My bars are hot, hot like a potato in the microwave
Got my game on lock, tighter than a TXTL safe
They work hard, and play hard, I play hard, but work harder
I want more success than the third installment of Tha Carter
And I'm spittin' flames, just call me a fire starter
I'd lay my life down for this music, I'm a hip hop martyr
Verse 2 [(Josh Smith] (On Radio)
Alright I'm goin' back in, I can do this all day
Dreamin' big, I'ma do me, I don't care what y'all say
I guess I can be considered a teenage version of Childish
I'm childish, steady gettin' mileage, I'm hot as sh—
Wait, I don't swear, but I swear I'm getting better
At this rap game, I'm just a Weirdo like Donald Glover
That's a comedy, comedy just like the show Community
If I'm ever failing than I guess that is the end of me
I wanna succeed in being all that I'm supposed to be
Supposedly, I'm rawer than some freshly killed animal meat
Uh, I'm an animal, I'm freakin' vicious with the flow
That makes me progressive, I'm a weapon and I'm 'bout to blow
Oh, I'ma slow it down, like a young black man when he sees a cop
Wait no, speed it up like that same man before he got shot
This music's all I got, it's my life, it keeps me goin'
Used my mind to craft this art, my potential is omnipotent
I wanna be the King, with a ring, a crown, a gauntlet, and robe on top
Of a throne
But until that time I'm under the rule of C. Gambino
Don't know how he does it but his music just gets through to me
He set up a goal for me, and that is where I strive to be
It's lonely at the top, but at the bottom it's still true
Don't know 'bout you, but I only have a few people that will come
Through
My relationships are shallow like the coastline of a crystal lake
Everywhere I go it seems to me like I am out of place

*Childish Gambino interview*

Back to my shenanigans, I'm stylin' like a mannequin
The competition's panickin', I make out like a bandit and
Steal the hearts from fans and then I stop and run it back again
I am eatin' though, check in the kitchen, there's sandwiches
Reality check, I am here still sittin' at my desk
Just a tiny fishy tryna break through the fisherman's net
My last name's Smith, I spit it clean, you might as well just call me Will
I know I strive for greatness and success, but yet here I am still
Livin' in the Culdesac, cooped up makin' an EP
Because the Internet, I'm killin' it, I feel like Royalty
Now this stuff is Camp, so I'm walkin' 'round with swagger
They say that I'm Sick Boi, but in truth I Am Just A Rapper
*Rick Ro$$ noise*

Outro [Josh Smith]
Hi, um
One ticket for Los Angeles
