“Where's the ground? Where’s the earth? Where's mom?”

She left

And now we're headed somewhere. Moment to moment. But we don’t know where and we can’t stop living. The Internet, our new earth, moves forward only leaving behind a curated record

Because the Internet was made to be the soundtrack to this new coding. The reworking of our humanity. Trying to find [each other/ourselves] again after the big bang. Every soul looking for each other like every drop of water looks for the Ocean

The rules of the Internet are the rules of our new universal language like the Bible, like the Constitution, we make rules to break later and be better. Pushing forward until we are all just a bodiless conscious, buzzing through the air trading information, conversing, testing ideas without fear or violence. Free from limit. This is the moment we decide if we want to be the kid pouring salt on a worker’s head at the sit in, or the kids sitting calmly in the face of what everyone else identifies as futility

… Or we can be the kid sitting back, just trying to eat. Ignoring what’s happening in front of them. Not having an opinion until the acceptable choice is handed to you by people you don’t know

We have reached a moment where there is no “real” because we don’t care anymore we can curate what’s real every day our timeline or feed. The boundary of what’s real and what we want to be real is as volatile as the worth of our bitcoin or human heartbeat

This is an important moment

But be[a]ware that we are all making it up as we go. Together

Our human collective unconscious

Our deep web
