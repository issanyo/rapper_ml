[Verse 1]
My style so sofa cause yea I'm always laid back
Walkin' through the grove with some slippers and a wave cap
My kicks so sick nigga I don't need a Maybach
Summer came early you want your fuckin May back
Cause I bring the heat nigga this is fuckin payback
Now I'm in LA where I lay at
Talk about heat, nigga, this is where they made that
I know that you digs me but where the fuck is Taye at?
Wow, to think you ignored him
Now I'm in my prime like one of the Transformers
Don't get mad I'm just following orders
To cut down haters and charm all of their daughters

Uh huh, you want me to keep goin?
Alright

[Verse 2]
A style so recliner because I will recline her
In about a half an hour so nigga check your timer
She is sick boy where'd you find her
I love these models slash handbag designers
Calling her a baby like I fuck with big timers
Cause I'm a big timer, got green like Slimer
Yeah, I just might slime her
And I ain't talkin' about the Hi-C drink neither
I'm sick in the worst way
Boy you mess with me it's 'bout to be your birthday
Whoops I meant merc day
Everyday's a work day
I love makin' shit, I don't need a vay-cay
And If you don't see me try my iPhone
Girl you don't know me, best to call Tyrone
Yeah my shit's viral, meanin' that it's internet
All up in your YouTubes, meaning that I'm into that
This a marathon yeah I'm winnin' that
I don't need a break I hate Kit Kat
These boys talk shit like shit chat
And I am the shit, I'm so Ex-lax

I'm the man out in Cali (x6)
