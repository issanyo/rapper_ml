[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
Someone keep that shit shut, all white, no cut
I fucked up but I still came and I still reign like thunder
Everything's been done some, screamin' like we love them
But I still get what I deserve
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Fall back, all that, freshmen you're welcome
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
Panic room blue, too soon to be into it
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired, A-Town, Empire
What you think we all about? Watchin' bitches trippin' out
