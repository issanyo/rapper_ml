[Verse 1]
Uh
Oh, oh, ok then, you bull it? Ol√© then
Go 'head and chase your tail, I'ma tell the beat to play dead
They let me off the leash, they let me off the leash
Everybody here to see me give me ten percent at least
And I do it for the masses, let a young dude preach
Crew full of REFS, so they let a young dude reach
For it all, get the bar, take it vertically
You all on the phone with a girl who prefer to call me
I'm busy though, oh we want a feature, but who is he though?
The circles that I'm running round, these spinners got me dizzy yo
Tell me if I'm blacking out, too late, no backing out
Used to be a quiet kid, but I'm used to bragging now
Since I started rapping went from Packy no to Packy now
Beating up the beat, went from Packidu to Pacquiao
And I ain't backing down, I'm laying up
Even when I let the beat breathe, I say enough

[Verse 2]
Now when I perform, they paying up
I want the attention, though, and they can't pay enough
I want it all, put me in the game, I want to ball
We just make 'em nervous in the summer then we kill 'em in the fall
I'm a Speck boy, aka, better than you any day
I'm all up in your girl's radio and getting heavy play
And lately, I've been in the studio like every day
Competition sleeping while I flow until the levee break
Oh my, heaven sake, get a load of this kid
Step into the batter box, take care of my biz quick
Too sick, I don't give three shits, make 'em forfeit
Give 'em high five, hit the door quick
I'm hesitant as ever, but I'm better than I've ever been
Represent the people and I've never been the president
Every day I'm better than the last one, no spot up in the game
But I'm coming after anybody that has one

[Verse 3]
And I don't think they'll ever understand me
You can understand me though
I ain't even start rapping 'til I was like eighteen
It was just a hobby, now the plan b is looking like a probably
I put music over most of it, fam' over everything
Now they going hand in hand, I'm seeing what my talent bring
It's a lot of balancing, hope it don't fail me now
If I don't make it they could tear me down
Went from flows on flows, to shows on shows
I need more time though, to expose my bros
To the fine things in life like choes on choes
A bank account that's got Os on Os
That's six figs at least, off sick lines and beats
And never worrying about rent time and eats
It's out there right? I'm 'bout that life
If it's out there then I'm all about that life

[Outro]
About that life, about that life
If it's out there then I'm all about that life
About that life, about that life
I'm all about that life
About that life
