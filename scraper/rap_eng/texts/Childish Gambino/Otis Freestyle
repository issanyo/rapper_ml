[Intro]
I'm Childish Gambino
INES and Foxy Show
Shia, you suck bad!

[Verse 1]
As the world's turning, feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurting, from all of its work cursing
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton
Till I'm walking in circles and I'm talking in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper mache
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Because ain't nothing changed, I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shooting
I can prove it, I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I been writing these verses while I'm having a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom cranking on out and staring black
Stereo blaring, Gwen Steffani can holla back
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
Shia, I'm coming straight for ya, I hope you know that I'm on ya
D to the O's got a flow like menstrual cycles
Change my face every year like Michael... Jackson
Cause I'm packing heat
I got the fucking beat and a fucking lead
Dripping on you motherfuckers all the time
I bust guts like I bust a rhyme
I bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes
And I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time
On Community
What you do to me?
Fly girls wanna get inside my booty
Or is it the other way around
Cause I'm skating on a skateboard, driving downtown
At Peachtree, Atlanta, Stone Mountain till I die
E-40 got nothing on this
Horny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia
Got something for ya
Yeah that freestyle was torture

[Outro]
I'm done!
