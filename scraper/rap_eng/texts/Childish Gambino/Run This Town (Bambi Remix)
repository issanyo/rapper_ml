[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air (Uh huh)
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down (This, this goes out)
Got a problem tell me now (To everybody in middle school)
Only thing that's on my mind (That didn't fuck with me)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? (Listen)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? (This goes out to all them, them dudes that get picked on)
We gonna run this town (Here we go)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Yea, the flow so absurd
It's C.G. boy, king of the black nerds
I gotta get my Urkel on
I won't stop until I see an afro at Comic-Con
And not just Samurai
I was an outcast, nickname Aquemini
The wait's over, like two pounds over scale
I'm doing big things like I'm eating out a whale
These niggas do the same shit because they scared to fail
I'm in a hot pink hoodie, I ain't ever scared
These niggas frontin', sayin' like "he gay and shit"
And then they wonder why nobody wanna play they shit

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
We are, yea I said it we are
Nigga I'm a soldier, trooper like I'm VR
Where's my fuckin' key card
It was right behind me
Fuck it, home girl you can blow me in the lobby
My girl loves brains, so she is my zombie
Na home boy, I don't practice, this my hobby
They all say make a demo tape so they can sign me
Cause yo boy stay mo hot than Gandhi
Listen up (Illll)
I don't do this for the limelight
I do this for kids who get picked on for talkin' white
I do this for kids who rock out to The White Stripes
If you a nigga with glasses and skateboards, I got you right (Illll)

[Hook: Rihanna]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To get here, it takes guts like the aggro
Crag
They used to call me fag
Cause I ain't wanna be on the corner holdin' the bag
"Well fuck them niggas, they only holdin' you back"
Said a little voice inside of me wearin' a yellow cap
Or maybe it was bright pink, I can't remember
Alls I know I wrote my first verse that December
Now I'm so sick boy, yea I'm straight loungin'
Niggas used to say "who?" like I'm Pete Townshend
Yea, it's hard to stay grounded
When you're Andre and MST 3000
All rolled into one nigga
I 69 a 49er boy, gold diggers
I grind all day to stay alive
So I guess I'm a Mac with a hard drive
If you think you hype now, see the boy live
Bright colors in the streets like I'm gay pride
Yea my hoodie look like it drank five alive
And these dudes play my shit like I'm Goldeneye
If you could see the best, go be it
And if I die young nigga so be it
Like I told you on the other track
If there's a dude tight as me, I ain't seen him yet

[Outro: Rihanna]
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
We gon' run this town tonight
