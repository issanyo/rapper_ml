[Intro: Childish Gambino]
We do it
We do it
We do it
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Kill ‘em
That’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’d be more dead
Than a horse head
In a four bedroom apartment
Bloggers that’ll start shit
You wanna criticize me
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearin’ some American Apparel
While you’re starin’ at a Tim and Eric DVD, uh
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob Shit, knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-tip or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just ‘cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on the neck while she’s buttonin’ up
Uh and my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out
They gotta camp out
Better than half of all rap that you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house, hands down
Fake niggas say “you the man now”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Yeah, Childish don’t go hard, what
Now everybody wanna fuck with me, slut
The flow is too sick
Got them white boy clothes and that black dude dick, uh
Now I understand why you gotta hate a nigga
East side, Stone Mountain-Decatur, nigga
Y’all niggas lame, I’m fly as hell
‘Cause I’m fuckin’ lame, and I don’t even care
