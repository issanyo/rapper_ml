(Verse 1-Heems)
Women are the best, women
Sometimes they're in a dress, women
Sometimes I wear my wedge, women
Sometimes they wear heels, women
Sometimes they make you feel angry
Sometimes they make you feel happy
Sometimes you get sleepy, and then you sleep with them and next to them, it's great
Sometimes they're on a date, they talk about all these things, how you equate one another to one another for one another
And how you love your lover, women
I like their energy, women
They got the best energy, women
They got positive energy, women
All of them are sweating me, women
The best, women
I must confess, women
I respect you, women
I wish more people respected you
Men are scum
Usually men are dumb
Usually men don't know nothing
Usually men is fronting
Women (ladies)
Women (ladies)
Women (ladies)
The world would be a better place if it was run by women
Women
Yo hold up
They got a glass ceiling, it's really not fair, for women
Childish Gambino!

(Verse 2-Childish Gambino)
Can't live with 'em
Can't live without 'em
It seems like you like 'em
You always rap about 'em
Especially Filipinas in jeans and beat up Adidas
Red hotter than Anthony Kiedis
Jesus lay off my penis!
Women who are independent still want their drinks for free
Women watch "New Girl" and say "Oh my God, that's me!"
Whaaaaaaaat?
The lamest nigga that you ever met
But I got that green so vagina showing mad respect
Women walk around with no pants like they Donald Duck
And be asking "Why you wanna fuck?"
Stupid!
You lucky I don't have a fuck
To give!
So I eat her Pinkberry 'til her eyes roll back
Like a dry contact
I'm making out to the "Drive" soundtrack
I'd die to sound black
But I'm stuck with this happy-go-lucky attitude
Women only be fucking dudes who be treating them sort of rude
Beat 'em and leave 'em bruised
Meet 'em at Ruby Foo's
Noodles and Looney Tunes under comforters smooching you
I'm not this type of dude!
Until recently
Now every Echo Park Shark want a piece of me
Secretly at a "speakeasy"
White niggas spinning Eazy-E
If it was me, girls wouldn't find it so interesting
I give a fuck if these trendy niggas is listening
'Bino be that nigga who's fucking quicker to kill himself
So when you like "I'm 'bout kill this faggot!"
I'm like "Need some help?"
