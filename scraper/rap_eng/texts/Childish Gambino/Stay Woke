[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Don't you close your eyes



[Verse 1: Simplisity]
I stay woke you live in your own closet
They stepping on your soul like their foot in ya foamposites
The true definition of right is so sovereign
Rihanna shinin’ brightest when using her own diamonds
Caution, they coming they drop in
They sellin’ your free will you willin’ to auction
You gettin’ some hot spins but how ‘bout some hot spits
They stealing ya own mind and holdin’ it hostage
Stay brave I ain't talkin’ no atlanta
We've came a long way from killin’ for bandanas
I been random I told you I can't stand it
Been tellin’ the whole world we doin’ this thing tandem
You could be the change, so don't follow what they chose
They don't really care and they telling you ayy so
Ain't tryna crush dreams so shatter ya rainbows
But you could make a difference so buddy just stay woke

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2: Simplisity]
I stay broke, I live in my own pocket
Ain't cashin' out with checks, ain't makin' deposits
I only pay with bills, and my paper thin wallet
I ain't been at the top so I’m makin' no profits
My grades are failin', my life is changing
But I care more about girl troubles
And party struggles, I'm Humble
But I got a lot to work on
My album was bad
And with all the time I had
It coulda been great
Top of the charts with no hate
My time awaits
I’m woke so I know just where to go
I’m young so just give it time to grow
I’m practicin' for my time to let it glow

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Don't you close your eyes
