[Intro: Kari Faux]
(That's right)
(That's right)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming
(They come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing
Breathing down your spine, oh

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming at her
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide, hide
(That's right, that's right)
(That's right, that's right)

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people
(And you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

[Bridge: Kari Faux]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Do you feel alive?
