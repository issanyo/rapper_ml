[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Suddenly relevant
White girls on me, you would think I was sellin' it
Black girl with me with a trunk like an elephant, took her to the suite and she gave me intelligent (Ya!)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Let the game speak for me
Are you doing these numbers? I don't think you are homie
I'm a real nigga, I don't tweet about it
If I see you in the streets, we can speak about it
And you all up in my business, you should keep up out it
I know you niggas doubt it, met her backstage, say my new shit classic, it won't age
Given two shits, on my green like pool sticks
Got no time for loose lips, what the fuck did y'all say?
Four seasons in Miami, I was like LeBron James
Had to tip the valet, know he wanna steal it
Young rich nigga, this the shit I gotta deal with
Old white money, that's the shit I gotta deal with
Had a head start, how'd I catch up?
Got a hard drive and it's backed-up
A couple hits, if you need 'em, you should ask us
I'm the new Ma$e, all my girls saditty
I got a new face, all my girls is pretty
I call it good taste, niggas can't buy that
Summer in Hawaii, man these niggas can't try that
Bring back the source BTI, where the fives at?

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Just pass me the paper, pass me the vapour
Don't pass me the hookah, cause I don't really smoke hookah
No I don't really smoke hookah, put weed in my hookah

[Verse 2: Steve G. Lover]
I dont do the hookah, I'm a roll a dutch
28 grams on hand, that's a fuckin' much
Roll it up, keep a bad bitch if that ain't enough
Shawty so clutch, got a gram in a Gucci clutch
I'm an OG, keep it OG, catch Z's on the flight, I had a couple blue dreams
Got a case in Sweden, man a nigga need to tighten up
All black Porsche, black card, I should lighten up
Roll a joint until my bigger brother light it up, hotel smoke-free, I don't really give a fuck
Bad girls make the cellphone beep, and she go both ways that's a two way freak
Post a U-ey up on Lenox that's a two way street
I was whippin' in the spider, not the kind with 8 feet
His spice, make it hot like without the A/C
On that purple all day, man shout-out to AP (Aye, aye)

[Outro: Steve G. Lover]
Pass me the swisher, yeah
Come pass me the swisher, eh
I say pass me the swisher, pass the swisher, pass the swisher
