Fuck Yourself!

[Verse 1]
Cool like a summertime pool in the winter
A nigga on fire, what he have for dinner
I bring home the bacon, call me breadwinner
I beat up the tracks so they call me track killer
Im thee raporilla, I heat like gorillas
So if you don't believe me you feel-a
I gotta get the million dollars
If you don't see me holla
If you tryin' to get then you swallow
I'm high as a kite, I feel fantastic
A girl on my dick so she call me nasty
I gotta make sure that my dick's in plastic
Or else I'm gonna end up inside a casket
Who the fuck's you? They call me Sick Boi
Got the Andre fever, get like Big Boi
If you try to get the kryptonite on me
You're gonna have to D-I-E

[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(It's Sick Boi, it's back)
The nigga is amazing
(Y'all know who it is)
The nigga is amazing
(Get wildin' like me)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing

[Verse 2]
I put down the pen, no more writin'
So when I die they can remember me like the Titans
Call Michael Chrichton cause I'm like Congo
If you don't believe me you can suck on my bongo
I used to drive a hondo now I'm on the subway
Now my pocket's thick like that dude from Subway
You can have a hyundai, better yet a milli
I'm not Lil Weezy but my pocket size silly
My wrist not chilly, I only sport Clockers
Got the purple hoody and the purple Gobstoppers
My momma used to tell me I was lost like Chaka
Now I got the yellow truck like my name Tonka
My girlfriend ass stay fit like J-Lo
Girl and my money stay thick like Play Doh
Got to philosophize my mind like Plato
What'd y'all say though?

[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(See I don't play around)
The nigga is amazing
(See when I say I'mma do something)
The nigga is amazing
(I say I do something)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
(Yo do this for real though)
The nigga is amazing
(I'mma try to kick it for real)
The nigga is amazing

[Verse 3]
Nigga I'm blazing
Nigga I'm amazing
Haters on the side line tellin me they hate me
Girls wanna date me, boys think I'm crazy
Girls always chase me like they Chasing Amy
I wanna be the play date, but if you have one
You can call me, on my cell phone
I don't believe it, I don't gotta see it
And if you don't see nothing you can sync up my penis
Women are from Venus, men are from Mars
And I'm walking down the street, while you drivin in cars
Cause I want everybody to see my new kicks
My hat broke off and my hoodie so sick
I used to know this chick, she used to be lame
Now she listen to me, now she usin' her brain
Yo I go to Bellevue cause my flow is insane, man

[Chorus Outro]
The nigga is amazing
(I said stay wildin' like me boi)
The nigga is amazing
(I came back with a vengeance)
The nigga is amazing
(I put down the pen so I could focus again)
The nigga is amazing
Fuck Yourself!
(S'why I don't write shit)
The nigga is amazing
