[Intro]
I just want to dedicate this track
To that one special girl
This song is really more than words
It's how i truly feel

[Verse 1]
Every time I see you my heart just flutters
And when we are together i don't have to hide my stutter
You are the only one that gets to see me
No phony, fakes, or fronts, but exclusive sneak peeks
I just want you in my arms all the time
Painting the town red, you're my partner in crime
Trying to make it work consumes to much time
And the future love yous they would all be lies and woah

[Hook]
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly to me
