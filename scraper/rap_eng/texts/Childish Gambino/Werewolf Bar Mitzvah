Aw man, Tray, look up at the sky
It's a full moon on the Sabbath
This is scary
Break it down

[Tracy Jordan]
I was working late on my Haftorah
When I heard a knock on my bedroom-doorah
I opened it up and to my surprise
There was a werewolf standing there with glowing gold eyes

He says tomorrow my son, you will be a man
But tonight's the time to join the wolfen clan
Tomorrow you will stand at the bimah and pray
But tonight let's gaze at the moon and bay

Werewolf Bar Mitzvah
Spooky scary
Boys becoming men
Men becoming wolves

Werewolf Bar Mitzvah
Spooky scary
Boys becoming men
Men becoming wolves

Alright, that was great Tray
Okay, it's over, that's a wrap, oh

The next day what happened
The Talmud didn't teach, oh there's more
I got up in front of everyone
To give my little speech

Then my teeth turned into fangs
And my nails into claws
And I nearly dropped the Torah
When my hands turned into paws

I growled and I roared
And my rabbi did as well
It was a rocking werewolf zoo
At Temple Beth-Emmanuel

Ey man, where'd you learn
All these Jewish words?
My manager, Harvey Lemmings

Werewolf Bar Mitzvah
Spooky scary
Boys becoming men
Men becoming wolves

I don't, I, I just don't think this the idea of the song
Can sustain itself for that long
Because it, it seems a little sweaty now
So this whole premise is sweaty

We had a reception at the Larchmont Country Club
They served a real nice brisket and an eight foot party sub
I danced with my cousins, I got money from my folks
We had a lot of fun making circumcision jokes

Then I remembered the premise of my song
I was at a nice reception but the werewolf part was gone
So we pulled ourselves together and we're wolf men again
Just in time for monster fight to begin, no

All the country club employees were brain sucking pack
Who had all turned into zombies and were on the attack, no man
So we fought them and some Dracula's and Frankensteins too
'Cause you gotta love Bar Mitzvah, even if you're not a, aroo

Werewolf Bar Mitzvahs
(There's no such thing as Frankensteins, steins)
Spooky scary
(There's no plural Frankenstein)
Boys becoming men
Men becoming wolves

Werewolf Bar Mitzvah
Kooky hairy
Boys becoming men
Men becoming wolves

I don't want this, I don't like this, this is scary
Turning into werewolves and stuff, you know?
I got excited when I saw poodle on the street the other day
Aroo!
