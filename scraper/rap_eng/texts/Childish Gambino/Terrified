[Verse: Childish Gambino]
There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh

[Post-Hook: Childish Gambino]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, ooh

[Outro: JD McCrary]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh!
Oh, you can't run from me
You can't hide from me
