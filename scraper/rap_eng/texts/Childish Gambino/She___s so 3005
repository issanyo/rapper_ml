[Intro: Pink Guy]
She’s so nice
She’s so nice
She lets me use her body
Okay (hol' up)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hol' up

[Chorus: Pink Guy]
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice (hol' up)
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice (hol' up)
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice (hol' up)
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Outro: Pink Guy]
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice (hol' up)
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
I treat her badly, but she comes back every time
It goes to show that none of these hoes are worth a dime
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
But she’s so nice
(We did it, wow!)
