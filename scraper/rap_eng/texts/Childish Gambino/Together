[Verse 1: Selah Sue]
I was lost on the dark side, till you crashed into my life
We were scarred by the bright lights
Falling stars through the night sky
I know we're broken parts, but ain't that just who we are

[Hook: Selah Sue]
We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
When I'm locked inside, you're the ties that free me
We should be together-gether, yeah
Together we hurt, together we take it (together, together)
Together we fall, we'll never be breaking (together, together)
If we were apart, I know that we'd fade away (together, together)
Together we are, together we make it

[Verse 2: Selah Sue]
Everything that we both know, summer nights left me so cold
Let me dream of this fair love, all the things that I'm scared of

[Hook: Selah Sue]
We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
[When I'm locked inside, you're the ties that free me]
We should be together-gether, yeah
Together we hurt, together we take it (together, together)
Together we fall, we'll never be breaking (together, together)
If we were apart, I know that we'd fade away (together, together)
Together we are, together we make it

[Bridge: Selah Sue & Childish Gambino]
I know we're far apart, I don't know where to start
And I know what the people say, but I choose your love anyway

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, love so good Ye coulda signed (oh)
Got the one thing I couldn't buy (yeah)
Niggas so mad when I walk through (yeah)
With you on my arm, what they gon' do? (yeah)
Woman in my life, you're the top two (yeah)
Hi Mom! (hi mom!)
Lights on, lights off (lights off , lights off )
Dylan, rap like this, you're an icon (oh)
Blue dream sounding like a pipe bomb
You and me together, maybe we could do it (do it)
Worst summer ever but we got through it (got through it)
Talk about the money, I was getting to it
Where you wanna go, where you wanna go?
Let a nigga know, let a nigga know (ah)
They ain't gotta know, they ain't gotta know (they ain't gotta know)

[Outro]
We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
When I'm locked inside, you're the ties that free me
We should be together
