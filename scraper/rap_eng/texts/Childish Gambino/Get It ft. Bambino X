[Intro]
Yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
This song was made so you could rave in suburban houses
Or college dorms, any party without a bouncer
So drink yourself into oblivion
I'mma be up in this corner, tryna mack on this girl named Vivian
I love parties where people don't have to pay
And you have to scream loud so you could communicate
Prude girls that are sweeter than Betty Crocker
Usually loosen up with a bottle of Johnny Walker
So take totes and quotes from me, the charmer
I get more ass than toilet seats and (inaudible) farmers
I'm screaming so loud, I'm popping the top of (inaudible)
While strappin' on a bomb, see your favourite (inaudible) terrorist
Lesson 1, always pretend you're listening
So if she starts to say a quote, try and finish it
This way, she'll think you're destined to be and then she stripping off clothes and showing anatomy
The bad in me, wants me to call her up again
Even though when I was talking I was thinking about her friend
So you can call me an asshole if you want
But I talk shit, so all of my shit comes out the front

[Bridge]
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it

[Transition]
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna-
Mo-Mo-Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna get it
Move it if you wanna-
