I used to play the fool all by myself
You used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes to help
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one but now...

Be yourself, there's no understanding
Some day...won't that be the night?
Be yourself, there's no understanding
There is no understanding, be yourself

Be yourself, there's no understanding
Some day...won't that be the night?
Be yourself, there's no understanding
There is no understanding

Be yourself, there's no understanding
Some day...won't that be the night?
Be yourself...
It is so hard to know
It's so hard to do
