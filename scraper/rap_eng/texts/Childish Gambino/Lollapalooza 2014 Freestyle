[Verse]
Whipping the Lamb, whipping and gripping the Lamb
Niggas like “Bino the man” I was like “damn”
I was allergic to not making money
The timing was perfect
They used to not pay me no nevermind
Niggas these numbers don’t ever lie
Fuck with your boy like a pedophile
Damn I’m fly, I’m so high I might need a spaceship
I’m on acid, this bitch is basic
We the niggas y’all love to hate on
But when they see us, y’all never say shit
Conversation, I’m in that, top 5, I’m in rap
Pussy niggas y’all say shit and don’t do shit
I flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Aww these niggas are not from Atlanta
These niggas are not from Atlanta
‘Cause I’m from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus
Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I’m Steve Urkel
Ur-kel, they want some chicks I’m like “oh well”
You better Google search
Money rule my universe
Nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse and said “Nigga, we hate it”
Living my life like I’m Jaden, Tesla the color of Satan
I understand why you hate us
Because I’m fuckin the best right now muthafucka, I’ll see you niggas later
