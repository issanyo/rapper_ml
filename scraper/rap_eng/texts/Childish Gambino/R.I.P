Yeah
I ain't no Gambino but
Let me give this a shot

[Hook x2]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Verse 1: Kid Kold]

Man fuck it
I’ve been ready to die
Notorious for my strong flows
Like the rockaways rip tides
I’m a Cezanne once the crescent rise
In other words I’m a lycanthrope
Were-man
Creature of the night
I’m artistic
My visions are obscure
Once depicted you need a prescription
To halt the process of slit wrists
Presidential mindset before this rap thing
Was content with that basic shit
My Hilary Clinton
Till I was introduced to the game
And made it my Mistress
The Gennifer Flowers
I Couldn't wait to de flower
So after words I can say I fucked the game up
And shut these lames up
Would think I’m part of Taylor gang
The way I up chuck
To the sounds of these rappers that say their time is coming up
Nah
Beast coast representative
I’m rabid foaming out the mouth
Destruction of competition my sedative
This hip-hop nation
Foot soldier homie on the front line
Tryna gain my ranks
So us rangers lead the way
Superior tactics
Black masks
Suppressor tips
Cause real g’s move in silence
I won’t stop till I’m on everyone’s devices
Pat Benatar, I’m all fired up
Funny how I get pennies for my thoughts
But the dimes are what influenced em
Hoping in the future it’ll prove to be lucrative
Till then I got a desire inside me where the truth will live
Yea
[Hook]
