DUDE 2's awareness begins to falter as he looks at The Boy. He springs back to life as he pushes The Boy into the door close to them. DUDE 1 kicks the door and starts firing at DUDE 2. The splashes of a body dropping into the pool ring in The Boy's mind

The Boy: Wetsuit.....

The Boy opens the door to the pool area. The body of DUDE 2 is seen floating alone surrounded by a mixture of red and light blue. A cellphone is seen lying on top of a jacket. MMMMMMM! The phone lights up as "Swank" appears on the screen. Tch....tch tch tch! The sound reverberates. Click! The screen changes to the messages section......"R E C K L E S S". The Boy looks down at the lifeless body of DUDE 2 floating in the pool

"There's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good."

He quickly looks away and stares at the message

"Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope."

The Boy puts the cellphone back in his jacket brushing past the familiar bullet hole that occurred on the fateful night. The walk back to the house was a long one

R E C K L E S S

INT - THE BOY's HOUSE (The next morning.......)

Birds chirp, the sun is shining. That rusty ass lawnmower sound. Can't a nigga get some sleep? Suddenly, 3 knocks is heard. Silence. Then, 3 knocks are heard

VOICE: Don!
