(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
Good little girl
Always picking a fight with me
You know that I'm bad
But you're spending the night with me

What do you want from my world?
You're a good little girl

(Verse 2: Madeleine Martin)
Bad little boy
That's what you're acting like
I really don't buy
That you're that kind of guy

And, if you are
Why do you want to hang out with me?

(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
[Laughing]
Don't you know I'm a villain?
Every night I'm out killin'
Sending everyone running like children

I know why you're mad at me
I've got demon eyes
And they're looking right through your anatomy

Into your deepest fears
Baby, I'm not from here
I'm from the Nightosphere, to me you're clear

Transparent
You've got a thing for me girl
It's apparent
