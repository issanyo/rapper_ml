Dude 2:
Go hide, now!

Dude 2 takes cover and starts shooting. The Boy glances through the door and sees FAM shooting at the police as he bleeds through his right leg. All of the sudden the gun shots stop and FAM is on the ground bleeding from his chest

The Boy:
This isn't how its supposed to end. FAM and the others are dying because of me

The Boy stares as FAM's breathes slower and slower. Then MARCUS comes in from the back

Marcus:
Aye we have to now!

The Boy:
Where are we going.... whats going on?

Marcus:
Just come on before more cops come

Marcus and The Boy get in a car and speed off

INT. Rental Home - Night

Swank, Marcus, Steve, Naomi, and The Boy all sit in the living room talking about what went down at the mansion

The Boy: (thinks)
I shouldn't even be here right now. FAM died because of me. I have to turn myself in

The Boy walks over to the front door

Naomi:
What are you doing!?

Swank:
You can't go out there man, those cops out there looking for you

The Boy opens the door and runs out and gets in the car. He speeds off passing all red and green lights. He slowly stops the car and thinks about FAM, his dad, and Naomi. A black van crashes right into his car causing him to bleed from his forehead and left hand. Then he looks up, light headed and blurry eye vision, he sees a cop walking up to him
