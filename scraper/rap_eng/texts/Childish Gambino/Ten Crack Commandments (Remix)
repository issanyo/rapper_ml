[Verse 1: Gambino]

Look sharp, homie give yourself a face-lift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades
I'm savin' all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge into the game, keep a lame so cut-throat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe spendin', make about a hundred G's
Pack them crowds up, Boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank god they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm cleanin concrete, you assin' Charmin
Bobby digital, Do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shoppin' in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70 these half dead followers
She look like she spelman, Secretly she hofstra
Put her in the club all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like an old boy popped her
Home is that outcast, Soul is that Fonté
Old school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit they don't know what do with it
I did what I did man, did you see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, nigga sweet and low
American royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop, why the fuck would we stop?
Yo, she had two sons, both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs, where did she go wrong?
Man, nowhere mama we just go where the money at
Royalty nigga, where the fuck you niggas at?
