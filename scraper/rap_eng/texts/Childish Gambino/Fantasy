I’m no man’s fantasy
I never planned to be
Didn’t come with a set of instructions
So you don’t know how to handle me
I’m no man’s fantasy
Well, I haven’t got the chance to be
It doesn’t really matter now
Because I’ve given up
Because I've given up

[verse]
Come check into my heart
My heartbreak hotel
Cause this is not a home
I’m sure you’ll soon be gone
I won’t pressure you to stay
Cause my love don’t work that way
I’m just living in the moment
And you should probably do the same

[hook]
I’m no man’s fantasy
I never planned to be
Didn’t come with a set of instructions
So you don’t know how to handle me
I’m no man’s fantasy
Well, I haven’t got the chance to be
It doesn’t really matter now
Because I’ve given up
Because I've given up

[verse]
I won’t caress your ego
I’ll only snuff your pride
I’ll probably leave you empty
If our bodies do collide
This love is temporary
It fades away with time
So don’t get too caught up
My love can be unkind

[hook]
I’m no man’s fantasy
I never planned to be
Didn’t come with a set of instructions
So you don’t know how to handle me
I’m no man’s fantasy
Well, I haven’t got the chance to be
It doesn’t really matter now
Because I’ve given up
Because I’ve given up
