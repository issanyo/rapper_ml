[Hook 1]
Do what you want
I'm telling you
Let me into your heart

[Verse 1]
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you

[Hook 2]
Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me?
I'ma get you, girl, ahhh!)

[Verse 2]
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see the sun

[Hook 3]
Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit
I really love you, girl
Oh, oh God

[Bridge]
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

[Outro]
I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me in
Girl you really got a hold, woo!
