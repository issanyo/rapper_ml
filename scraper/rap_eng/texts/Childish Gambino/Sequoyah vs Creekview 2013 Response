First off I told you all before
Real men don’t want no war
Tools play their way into danger like we’re on toy story
But since you guys wanna play the role of submission
I’ll accept competition
Let’s get it started and kick up the gas
Who was that first cat who dissed tryna act
Sounded like Macaulay Culkin snorted a line and picked up a pad
Hit the studio and recorded while taking it from the back
The second dude you were alright
But the type to get scared without a nightlight
You spit a little something yeah, yeah and got the spotlight
Not noticing I’m livid, living life up in the limelight
That was for me, now it’s time to spit it for the clan
We’re the chiefs, basically we claimed king and kicked you off the land
First quarter y’all asking refs for us to only block with one hand
Don’t worry this is just the story of Lions and Lambs
Hundred arrows flying towards you, y’all just growl and take em!
Chiefs and the field are a double duo like Darth Maul
Cream your whole squad that’s word to Haagen-Dazs

(Hook)
It’s Chief’s nation time to set it off
Y’all wish you were us, but get X’d like Cannonball
We’re taking over, stay 100 yards ahead of y’all
On Friday, we’ll just let the confetti fall

Yeah I know the streak, but we’re gonna overtake the game
Don’t touch this diss, it’ll be like grabbing Satan’s cane
Take the L, while the students wave their heads in shame
Then Friday repeat the same mistake again
Consider this a bounty from the rawest school in the county
Who are you scaring? With paws as soft as downy
DJ Austin declaw your squad on each return and downing
Lauletta won’t even sweat ya
Watch out, homie those bullet passes might wet ya!
Feminine dudes over there, probably borrow the cheerleader’s sweaters
We got MVPs, y’all got P’s and V’s
I can’t believe, y’all tryna step to the Chief’s
Adam Patterson leave you with that Devin Hester speed
Tito leave your fur open with peepholes
Isaiah gets all your team’s credit, rest of y’all get repo-ed
Y’all came with the diss first and still get picked last
I’m hoping the rhyming thing was just a fad
You might not wanna try to respond I might add
Or end up with the student body laced in a cast
Excellence is observed when Exley plays the pass
CJ Collins is a hitman, paid to blast
(Hook)
