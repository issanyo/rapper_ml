[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Ok, here we go

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Yes I'm back to bat again
Yes these rappers sad again
The beat is hot and grabbin' them
And holy shit, like Vatican
Boy so sick he need a doctor in his condom
Don't worry about that hearsay just worry about what I know
Cause I know how to rhyme though
I got these girlies wailin'
Country's in my backyard, I'm Mr. Sarah Palin
Girls call me cutie pie but I don't really know them
Call me Mr. Facebook because I superpoke them
Leave that pussy open
But only if you want it girl
We can play SF4 grab a controller girl
Callin' me the prostitute, not cause I got a baby
They callin' me the prostitute cause "Fuck you. Pay me."

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Ay yo
Y'all niggas need to stop, stop, stop, stop
Uh huh
Ok, listen up
Y'all heard this shit before
Y'all niggas need to stop, stop, stop, stop
This is the part of the song where somebody's supposed to come in
And talk and shit
But I don't talk
I just do baby

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
My turtleneck tucked in
I'm spittin' shit like I'm Teddy Ruxpin
With batteries in
I don't really eat words but I do eat carpet
A nigga stay down like I'm made of stock markets
I love to sport green like my last name Flanigan
I'm breakin' up with girls over twitter like Aniston
Cause ain't nobody know me but my momma and my daddy
My flow stay hot like I keep it in the attic
Put my cash in the freezer
Cold presidents
So I call them Frost Nixons
Or Eskimo Clintons
Fuck with my pension, you 'bout to get your head lost
You gotta pay me double back and that's your overhead cost
Cause I'm the boss
And yes I stay sauced
To that creak in the cave
Oh behave
Bitch

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Let's do this
Keep it bouncin' y'all
I gotta get outta here
Yo, you know, it's C.G
