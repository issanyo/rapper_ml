There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me

Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see (we pretty much amazing)
There is no one like me [x2] (mind your manners)

[Verse 1]
I'm blowin' up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls that turn me down are saying? Please and sorry
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club telling strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "sm"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fucking with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
