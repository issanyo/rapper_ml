[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell 'em run it back, this song is my shit
Told that DJ "Turn it up!", all we did was Blowflex (woo)
It’s that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boys know shit about me
Still real, no shit, cash gun; money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left (yeah)
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy, we fresh to death
They be sleeping when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to keep y’all hyped, that’s that turnip green
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin’ over this nervous shit?

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I won't stop, are you proud of me?

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
I should have known
