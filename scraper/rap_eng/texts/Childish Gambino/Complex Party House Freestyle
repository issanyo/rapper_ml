Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward
Break out the Sudafed, cause the flow cold like a SoCo
I was smoking John Lennon with my Yoko
It's that [?] grandma you ain't ready yet
[?]
I'mma show we the illest
Got my grandma to kill it
I'm in the mood so you feel it
I'm in the the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back, we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
MENSA, we that Tony Danza
Lying on my rug, bitch you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Tonka
Vape so good, I ain't gotta smoke blanca
Nigga, I'm a monster, fuck it I'm a mon-star
Man I got this beat, I'm going HAM like a cop car
