[Verse]
Bad bitches be surroundin' me (They do)
All cute, ass thick out like a balcony
Sweater wear, I do these hoes, they gon' have it out for me
'Cause I just give 'em dick and go, these hoes know my policy
White bitch bust it open, I nicknamed her [?]
Ha, ass faker than a wannabe (A wannabe)
Yo man don't have a clue we fuckin', soon he's gonna see
But he won't even trip 'cause girl, I'm everything he wanna be
Wait, wait, listen, what I say, ho? (Say, ho)
Tired of these fake bitches thinkin' that they J-Lo (Ha)
Fake hair, butt shots, ass feel like Playdoh
All these made up bitches (Bitches)
Mind [?], ha
But fuck it girl, 'cause you know how to pop it
I just plugged 'em up with dick, all these hoes is sockets
I just hit these hoes' switch, treat these hoes like topics
Since a diamond's only change, let me keep that in my pocket
Look, ha, but I still fuck you baby, stay calm
Want me to put it in? Sure (Wha?), State Farm
She's said "my man comin', please daddy, don't take long"
Now ain't that about a bitch like a Drake song?
Flow crazy, there ain't no comparin' this
Everything I write the bomb, I fuck around and tear her wrists (Sheesh)
Ha, I swear my shit be too cold (Too cold)
Pockets so Fat Albert, no wonder how I pull hoes (Pull hoes)
I been pull hoes fuckin', my dick stood up like mistakes
Conversation good but my dick great
Packin' like I done switched states
Caught me up but my bitch ain't
I'm right boss, my wrist break
I fuck a bitch then I'm tired of her
I put her out like mixtapes, uh!
It's REASON, bars is what you gettin', nigga
Bitches lookin' for your boy like he missin', nigga
She fucked me good like I just got out of prison, nigga
Dick full of memories, how she gon' forget a nigga? Ah!
Huh, how she gon' forget a nigga?
Huh, she been fuckin' with them different niggas
Fake breasts but she fuckin' with the realest nigga
Huh, give 'em my pickle then quit dealin' with her
Huh, this off the top, this ain't written, nigga
Every Friday, I should be feelin' niggas
Huh, I swear that I be killin', man
I'm on the fuckin' top like I'm comin' from the ceiling, nigga wait
