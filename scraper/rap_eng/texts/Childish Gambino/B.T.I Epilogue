BLACK

He’s awake in the mansion, it’s bright outside, the alarm clock says 06:24, getting back to sleep isn’t an option, he vapes. There’s a distant beep, this happens every few seconds throughout, always distant

THE BOY
Just another dream

He walks through the kitchen, it’s a mess, there are strangers asleep on the counter, he goes straight to the bathroom mirror. He spots a stain on his shirt

He takes it off to throw it in the washing basket and we see the bullet hole scars, he touches them, his face as if he is seeing them for the first time

THE BOY
Just a dream (x2)

Fresh shirt, back to the kitchen. Everyone is gone, alone. The Boy sits at the table with a bowl of cereal. Going through his feed, he scoffs, retweets, retweet fails, retweet fails again. He puts the phone down. We hear it buzz. The name on the screen is NAOMI, he exhales and answers

THE BOY
Hey

The signal is terrible

NAOMI
Can you hear me?

THE BOY
Hello?
NAOMI

I’m right here

The Boy looks around whilst on the phone

THE BOY
I can’t see you

NAOMI
Why don’t you ever listen?

THE BOY
It’s not me, it’s the phone

As he walks around he notices red stains on his shirt. Walking with the phone in hand he goes back to the bathroom, ‘ROSCOE'S WETSUIT’ written in lipstick in the mirror, he removes his shirt, instead of scars we see bloody bandages. The boy rubs his eyes, stares, repeats-

THE BOY
Just a fucking dream

CUT TO- Hospital bed, THE BOY is in a coma, cuffed to the bed, the camera pulls back, we see NAOMI. A final voiceover-
THE BOY (V.O)
Just a dream

CUT TO BLACK
THE BEEPING STOPS
