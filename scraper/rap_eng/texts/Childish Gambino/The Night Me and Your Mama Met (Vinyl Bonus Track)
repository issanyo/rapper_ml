[Verse]
I used to play the fool all by myself
It used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes too
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one around

[Hook 1]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no no no
There is no understanding, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook 2]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
There is no understanding
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
No understanding what happened that night, baby
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
Oh, there is no
With you, with you
