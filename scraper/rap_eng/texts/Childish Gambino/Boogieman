[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 1]
If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)

[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 2]
Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my nigga's words
But if he's scared of me
How can we be free? Yeah

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)
