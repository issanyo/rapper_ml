[Hook x3]
We level up, we level up
Yea, we level up
Hey stranger, where you been?
Long time no see
This is the remix, we goin' in
Another round on me
Yea, we level up
We gonna climb up the levels, go harder
Lights flash every time we go past
I'll never lose the game, I'm gonna last
So let's start, we level up

[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino]
Look at what we started
Flow so retarded
Face paintin' Mona Lisas, told you I'm an artist
They don't even card us
They don't even look twice, I don't even look nice
What are you wearing, Northface?
Just to make a statement nobody sayin' we made it
I braided my hair, niggas will say that they care
Niggas will say they won't stop
Niggas are sleepin' a lot
Drive make for all the dollar signs, believe it or not
Um, yea Sway, we got 'em, we over nine thousand
We all leveled up like we just beat Bowser
Bino do the verses, somebody gon' need a s√©ance
Your boy is Crayola, give me a track to go cray on

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Sway]
Okay, okay, let's have some silence
Kids, time for a word from Sway
Me and the scientist were in the lab makin' the Earth quake
And I heard this phrase that had me workin' hard
Even on a Church day (We level up)
Gotta thank God for my gift of word, pray
Took that banana off rappers' matters
Now I'm gettin' recognized in manors from Madison Square to Matter Park
Sorry, I coughed up from that same manner that Ben drew
Flew across the continent with Donald, yea I had to duck
Get the picture?
My instagram is instant so the whole wide world could see
Who is the man in England and the bass line's ill
Feel the symptoms, them other rappers is Shelbyville
We are still the Simpsons, I bought a two mil house
So I could end up with two Lisas and I'll be seein' double
We are the biggest two features on the international come up
Get-get-get your thumb up
Gotta give a hand to Glover it's that remix
Level up

[Hook]
