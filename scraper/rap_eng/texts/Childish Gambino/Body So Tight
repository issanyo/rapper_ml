[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I heard in Miami they're making it nasty
Send me a pic, Gambino Aveeno that ashy to classy
When you were the shit it was loose in this bitch
Drinks, drugs, chicks and Uggs
Weirdos sipping Cuervo or that Indica
Grown man singing "Where is the Love"
Who the fuck no grown man?
Young boys who make no sense
Young girls with that old chest
Now I'm like oh yes, oh yes
Reflex
We just go squirrel shit
That's nuts, ask us
Do we give fuck?
No

[Hook] x4
Body so tight

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
And like that
I had one taste and I'm right back
She squeezed into that tight dress
But she squeeze out for that night cap
Got a few girls and they white-black
Red-yellow, few brown
So I beat it up like Knockout
And she ain't last for like 2 rounds
It's the new sound
For strippers and students to get down
Just hits now
Fly ladies get loose with it
All the bourgie bitches just sit down
These mixed girls with two-tones
With the nice bodies, they too toned
Came here with like five girls
That'll circle-twerk with no shoes on
Like: work
Damn baby, you don't need a holiday
She got a body language you know what that body say
Tattoos on her body like that body paint
Drop it low, bring it up I bet you everybody say:

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
This G shit: gold chains and a v-neck
Yeah we flex, star status
Do the whole world with no regrets
Just G jets
Concepts, this type of shit you ain't seen yet
Did a whole tour for like six months
So the game mine, no reset
Fast money, my reflex
These fly beats, that's Reflex
Killin' the shit for like, how long?
Y'all give me my respect?
Got skills man, I'm sayin'
These young chicks, I raise em
She fine now but in three years
I bet the whole style'll be amazing
Like
Give her three years I bet that body right
Coppin' clothes better now she know her body type
Her ex-man, trippin' wishin' that he got it right
Get a body bag, she killin' everybody like:

[Hook]
