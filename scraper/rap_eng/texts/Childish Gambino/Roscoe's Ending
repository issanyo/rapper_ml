Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside

Yelling

VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

The Boy looks both ways. He does not know what the fuck is going on. Cop cars are everywhere outside. The Boy runs and leaps out the glass window. While mid air, Life: The Biggest Troll, begins to play. Landing in the pool, he survives

Climbing out of the water, gun shots start to go off. He slides under the fence and continues to run. More shots go off

Cop: FREEZE! We know you have it!

The Boy: What are they talking about?

He continues to run, then a Lamborghini Mercy stops in his way. Of course, it is blasting Mercy by Kanye. The Boy stops. The door slides down, and he is shot

Voice: Is this the guy?

Yeezy: Yeah that's him. Kim's been looking for it forever

Yeezy puts another bullet in the Boy's head. Reaching into the Boy's pocket, he finds a piece of paper. He unfolds it

It reads

ROSCOE'S WETSUIT
