[Intro: Joesph Hampton]
Welcome to Posi+ive
Do it with your own hands
Who told you no?
No!
I don't need help
I never did
Cause a problem?
Solve it
Welcome to Posi+ive

[Skit: Babeo Baggins & Babe Simpson]
How does this sound?
I think it sounds good
No.. fresher/better!
It's better though
I don't know, seems bad, is it bad?
I don't think it's bad
I'm the best
You are the best
Are you sure?
I think if you weren't the best you wouldn't think you're the best already
I don't know, I can't decide
Why wouldn't you be the best?
That's true. Maybe?
Maybe so
Maybe not
What's the maybe though?
Who's better than me?
I couldn't tell you, there's no one
Somebody
Not anyone we can think of
You're right, nobody's better than me
'Cause you're the best
I'm the best
You're the best
I'm the best!
You're the best!
I'm the best!
You're the best!
