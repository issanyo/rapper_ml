Call me cool in the game
Because I make it rain
And I'm cool like a fool in the summer
Yes, I need a plumber
Because I make the girls leak
If you don't believe me you go and hear my girl speak
Yeah my dick be perfect
Yeah my dick N'Sync
Call it Justin Timberlake
And I always wear pink
Yeah
I always make dumb money
The world's Patty Mayonnaise and I'm Doug funny
