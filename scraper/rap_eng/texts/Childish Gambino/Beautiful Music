[Intro: Rapsody]
Ka$h, Ka$h dont make beats, he make
Beautiful music, one-two-one-two
My man Murs, what's up Murs?
Beautiful music

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Yo, beautiful music it raised me
Like daddy belt when I was actin' all crazy
Sneakin' headphones on the buses to school
While them other fools was fightin', I was rockin' to AZ
The night they made me, probably listened to O'Jays
That's why I love music, keep it runnin' like OJ
In the fashion of most (Mos), wearin' out all the old plays
Black on both sides from my skin to the old Jays
Just yesterday I was rockin' the Ol' Jay
My blueprint, tryin' to see me through it all like Oakleys
He changed the game like Kelly did foreplay
Now they pee-pee in they tee-pee when they see me like Biggie
Nowadays, styles done changed like CK
They inclined to listen to the same song on replay
Keep a gang of stars in the halls where we play
Cause there ain't a lot of songs nowadays they anticipate
Like Jamla, Phonte, Rozay Ricky
It ain't all rosey like Andre say
We lost three legends, Whit, Etta James, MJ
Gotta protect the kids where I live, my pen state (Penn State)
Until they state of mind feelin' every word I say
Beautiful music couldn't beat like old D Dre with Beats
How we beatin' everything that they play?
Beautiful music, my brother man Ka$h done make, it's beautiful

[Hook]
Now how it look? It go
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, hey
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, tell 'em it's beautiful music

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Word, you ain't heard the Pharcyde?
Burning disks for them high school car rides, like
Ooh-la-la-la, it's over
Traded in the Fugees for my cousin's Stankonia
He used to bone to Bone Thugs in his waterbed
Rockin' dreads listenin' to new Portishead
Wu-Tang to Midnight Marauders
Comin' out a system while I'm chillin' with his daughter
Fathers would freak out, "You listen to P-Funk?"
I listen to anything when she's sportin' them C cups
Jill Scott and Gil Scott-Heron
Was blarin' out of the dorm of the woman that I swear I was marryin'
It's them cold NYU winters
Laptop, brown socks, and no dinner
Drownin' out the sound that my stomach made
Napster, nigga I got everything
Yeah, Fruity Loops lookin' like Tetris
I want to be Pharrell so bad I got the haircut
I want to be Pharrell so bad I cut the drums out
And put my own verse on the end when it comes out
Lost my V-card to D-R-E
She liked Train so we broke up, listen to Big, grow up
Listened to J-Hova, I was a J-Hova, witness
Trying to make sense of the beautiful music

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GQ]
Yeah, hah, appreciate you sis
Yeah, I don't know much y'all, but I do know this
I've loved this since my cousin had a two-door whip
To Ms. Hill, I still get chills from The Sweetest Thing
To every angel still prayin' for Anita's wings
A fantasy Mariah singing with Old Dirty
I played Regulate back when Pac played Birdie
Hi there, Beautiful Idea, repeat it
To get by Mary and Meth was all I needed
Uh, I guess I got addicted at a young age
702 was playin' games in the subway
Mind playin' tricks on me, do I look confused?
I just want my day to go as good as Cube's
I'm all smiles though, I thank sis dearly
It's more than a art, I paint this clearly
I swear from this feeling get an extra lift
But thank Rap, she just blessed you with Beautiful Music

[Outro: GQ]
Yeah, she just blessed you with beautiful music
Sis, you got one girl, yeah, Ka$h
Somethin' that just feel good, you know?
Somethin' you ride to, wake up in the morning to, go to sleep to
It feels good, yeah
Right, like, Jamla yea
9th Wonder, idea of beautiful music
Sis, that be that beautiful music
Ka$h, beautiful music
GQ, beautiful
