Alright, Nick Swaggy is a mastermind
Drop some bars to pass the time
I'm for real, never lie
You know I'm one of a kind
My swag is super mean, yeah it should be made illegal
I'm the flyest rapper here, flyer than a soaring eagle
Yeah Nick Swaggy puts in work, I'm the best don't test me
They say I'm always right even though I ball lefty
Yeah these kids be going crazy when they hear my first song
Haters say I can't rap that is just so wrong
Yeah I'm bout to Hiroshima, drop a bomb on this track
Rappers want to be like me they better take a step back
And my clique always be fresh, yeah we always ride together
And I'll probably steal your girl, you might as well forget her
Ballin' with my crew when we last seen the haters
We were told that we suck, we just said see you later
Swaggy P, I'm a G
You don't want to come near me
My fan base is too big, there's a big bang theory
Put the city on my back though, what do y'all think
I'm already at the top, no need to find the missing link
If you think I'm not a rapper, then you should of told me
I'm the best, I got bars, I was just the old me (AHHH!)

Alright I'll tell y'all the truth though, I am just a rapper
The only thing I need are my bars and my swagger
And I'm not even done, you can think it, I just thought it
I need to stay fresh though cause it's swaggy poppin, swaggy poppin
This is a game and rapping is a sport
Are there other rappers here? Minority report
Put the team on my back. Lebron James on the court
I be dunkin' on these dudes, I just jump they too short
I'm the flyest like a bird
I'm too good that's the word
And if you thinkin' you can beat me, then you are just absurd Maine
I got some bars that are insane
So insane they be messin' with your brain gain
I'm boss with it
You too negative, I'm always positive
So rock with it
I don't say that much, I'm not that talkative
Get lost with it
My rap game is strong, it's provocative
Respond to this
I'll send you to space, just like a rocket ship
Chillin' with my home boys, rappin' to these dope beats
I kill the game with every bar. You don't even know me
So don't try to come near me
In fact you better fear me
I'm the illest rapper here, there's no medicine that can cure me
I went hard all winter, I will not stop now
In the back of the booth, doing work I'll make you proud
Yeah my songs have so much power, I hope you know I dominate
Started from the bottom, yeah I started out from concentrate
Man can't you tell that my albums always sell
Rappers wishing that they were me like they wishing from a well
Yeah I'm the best, I'm the man like Tebow
I be swimming in the money, you can't find me call me Nemo
Think about it for a second
I'm so ill like I'm infected
Man, I'm too smart call me Sheldon
At the top, now I'm in heaven
A good rapper won't ever quit, so Nick Swaggy always perseveres
Other rappers hiding, where they at? They always disappear
Killin' the game. No I'm not playin'. Puttin' in work, I am the best
Told all these people I'm in it to win it, I will never fail-- I'm taking a test
I spit fire man. I can feel the heat
This song should be canceled. Swaggy P
