[Intro]
Yes it is
A crime is a crime
From the tiniest marble that rolls down a storm drain
To an autographed baseball that rolls down a storm drain
Now who's doing this
I'm in, I'm in
To the storm drain
No Charlie
No

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino
Hot as Nevada, Reno
Niggas that say, what he know
Give me five like I'm Tito
I never touched a kilo
Opposite Al Pacino
I keep a light saber like I fuck around with Greedo
It's time to be a grown-up
Nigga get your odor
See a nigga rolling
Riding on diplomas
Damn this beat is so nuts
Thank you, MC DJ
Yeah, my mouth is nasty
Like I gave a BJ
I don't give a fizzuck
These niggas are out of lizzuck
This nigga is off the hizzook
Like walking out a prison
For me I see the vision
You're fucking with ambition
Casino money like Navajo
Their money says, Geronimo
My money comes in lotto dough
Be me on the other tit
Call me Mr. Masturbate
Tighter than your jerking grip
You looser than some turkey neck
Haters need to listen up
My attitude's a prostitute who broke
Cause she don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Verse 2: MC Chris]
The game is afoot, the mystery's at hand
We like to pilfer podiums, in other words we take a stand
We make a plan, attack that jam like it was Afghanistan
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van
Stop and listen be shoplifting 'pocalyptic Stephen King
I take a stand, fuck the man
Now will you please pull that string
I need your case and a dime
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups
Takin' a bite out of crime, so all criminals better hold up
I be riding forever
Like a vampire on a bus
Like a roller-coaster tester
I be riding till I bust
I got my magnifying glass
My bike matches my cup
Watch my seekers eat pedal
You can dine on my dust
Whatever it is we can handle
But we really don't do murder
Fuck up suspects, gather clues
Then we break for a cheeseburger
No shit Sherlock, mad like Murdock
If there's a mystery going on
Be in it like Robin Williams chilled in Good Morning, Vietnam
Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
This comedy movie was not fun to make
At all
So when you're sitting in your living room and you're yucking it up
Or in the theater
Or, you know, and you're saying oh with your little friends
Oh this is so funny
It's not funny
We started making this five years ago and we're still trying to get shit right
I'm going to get some Cheez-Its from Krafty
