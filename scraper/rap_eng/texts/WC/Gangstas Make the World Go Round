[Produced by Cedric Samson & Ice Cube]

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I'm gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a Frisbee
Gangstas and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facin'
But give me 7 seas and 11 G's
I make enough cheese to bring Wall Street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the Empire State Building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But niggas in school is scared of the Goodfellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya Honor I'mma have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my flat in west Bolivia!
I blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Than swim with the big fish
YOU fuckin' guppies!!!!!!!!

[Hook]
Gangsta's make the world go round

[Verse 2: W.C.]
Nine just saggin', wavin' my flag and
Never will I ease up nigga, so stop askin'
See I was taught as a tiny locin' on the set
It's all about the pussy and money fuck the rest
Nigga what tech is quicker to collect when I'm seekin'
All the jewelry and the money, so miss me with that preachin' teachin'
Fuck all that bullshit I want to slang yay like Noriega
Sit back watch my paper
Collect like the I.R.S
As I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the President
And like the police I want a gang of killers all on my Side
That's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride
On my behalf as I call shots, as if I was Saddam Hussein
Jackin' motherfuckers for Dana Danes
Hated by many but I don't care because I rather be feared than loved
With a pocket full of dubs
'Cause gangsta gangsta's, make the world go round
And if you want a piece then you best to be down
So quit, chastisin' me, analyzin' me
And like the escorts look over your shoulder nigga what's plain to see
Crooked ass cowards

[Hook]
Gangstas make the world go round

[Verse 3: Mack 10]
360 degrees like my D's the world be spinnin'
Nigga's been sinnin' since the beginnin'
History's a trip so I peep when I am readin'
Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin' six cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandalous bitin' forbidden fruit
But gangsta's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulatin' hoes I rolls with the best side
So check it as my lifetime is tickin'
Comin' up strong lickin' and flippin' chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need to make up your order
Everything from baggies, triple beams, to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch, a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song yo momma sings, just served your ass You on your way to killa king nigga
So now I stand, with heat in hand
For my whole life span, 'cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it, keep it loaded devoted, since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas
While my world keep twistin' as a Westside, gangsta
FO' LIFE NIGGA

[Outro]
Gangstas make the world go round
Westside is the best side
Gangstas make the world go round
Hittin' vicks for the '96 nigga
Gangstas make the world go round
Westsiiide!
Gangstas make the world go round
Ice Cube I'm the don of the clique
Gangstas make the world go round
Dub-C put it down with this connection
Gangstas make the world go round
Mack 10 straight stompin' and chicken hookin'
Gangstas make the woOOrld go round
