Code of the night is droppin' these thangs on your dome
Hittin' up my enemies, mad doggin' 'em with a heart full of stone
Blam blam! Kickin' yo' door down, throwdown, dirty and low down
It's 'bout to go down, who ready for the showdown?
Which one of y'all wanna be the first to get tossed in the tussle?
Buckle, choked up by these muscles and taste these knuckles
Lost I'm runnin' 'em all, haters, I'm gunnin' 'em all
Tricks, I done done 'em all then I ain't go no love for none of y'all
I'm comin' through like a Brougham, givin' it up with both hands
Slaughterin' your whole fam, rippin' up the program
Total chaos, deadly as snake eyes, so can't
None of you bustas hurt me, fool, I'm a G with no mercy

Snoop Dogg
When I say, "Hell", you say, "Yeah"
(C'mon) Hell yeah (C'mon) hell yeah
(C'mon) Hell yeah (Everybody c'mon) hell yeah
(Everybody, body) Hell yeah
(C'mon, c'mon) Hell yeah (Ha ha)

If you down with these hits say "Hell yeah!"
If you came to get busy say "Hell yeah!"
If you like what you see say "Hell yeah!"
If you down with me, say "Hell yeah!"
If you like what you see say "Hell yeah!"
If you came to get busy say "Hell yeah!"
If you down with Stone Cold say "Hell yeah!"
Party people in the house say "Hell yeah!"

WC
Gettin' my bail on, swell on, far from a rookie
I spit in your face and look at ya, dare ya to say somethin' to me
Temper tantrum, smash random, quick to put you in a casket
The fool that run up is that fool to get his ass kicked
{???} you the ones, it's an open invitation
These ass-kickings I'm dishin', they got no discrimination
Patience, long gone, I'ma, chalkin' em off
Walkin' up, bombin' on sight 'cause I'm through talkin' to y'all
Hands up, loc, I'm lit up, fed up, ready to bust, shakin' 'em up
Wettin' 'em up, slangin' these knuckles, cameras, I'm gettin' 'em up
Raised on the turf where we slay for the turf
And I'm the realest rider to walk the face of this earth
Strapped you best to be, ain't no standin' next to me
Checkin' me, thought I warned you cowards about testin' me
Pressin' me, see the game of pain, yo I'ma plug it
I'm so rugged, shhhh, I'm cold blooded

Yeah, y'all know what time it is
Y'all know how it's goin' down
No surrender, no retreat, no takedown
Beanie Mac cookin' up the track
That's right, Snoop Dogg and Dub C ridin' in the back
Make sure y'all know what time it is
Huh huh, yeah, we gon' make this happen
For everybody out there, the heat bangers, and headbangers
Check this out, what's crackin' homey?
