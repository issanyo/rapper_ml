[Intro: Knoc-Turn'al]
Now that's cool
You know
I chill wit ch'all though a little bit
Fuck the ???
I ain't give a fuck about that nigga
And he came hittin my weed
He came drinkin my Hen'
Matter fact if I see him in traffic, even though y'all fuck with him
It's on

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go (let's go)
Get yo party on with me (get it crackin in this motherfucker)
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
On the mic I been a demon since semen
Have you screamin': Oh mama, here come that young Osama
With that Al-Quaida drama
Fuck no, it's the Dalai Lama
With that West World Order
Now MC's Bow Down and treat me like Yoda
When they catch me in the corner at the club
Like "nigga what", they throw up the dub
So you can tell Samuel L. I'mma keep ac'in
You can even tell that motherfucker Jesse Jackson
Pay your child support, keep your payments up
Put a rubber on and don't fuck with us

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
Mack pull up in the rag, Chevy layed the ass
And crumble green on a Zig-Zag and lace it with hash
I keep a 9mm cocked and ready to blast
So when the phone jump off a nigga ready to smash
I drink my yac out the bottle
I don't fuck with a glass
And I ain't set tripping dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it, I downed it fast
Or I'm creeping through your window breaking out your glass
Then I rob the whole party looking through a ski-mask, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: W.C.]
From the land of the Lakers, bird breakers, Impala pedals
While we chop dollars with those in sombreros
It's the check a ho, when the cutlass checkin doe
So so ghetto Dub S rep the (ball/boat)
Ball gritty but a group of hogs with me
And V.I.P. yo from mad dog 20/20
Dub C. chucking up the 23rd alphabetical
Steel swiss hanging like a testicle
Lick 1, 2 to the nose my bump was [?]
Take a picture trick my foe's posing like the Heisman
I'm burnin money, trying to slide some in your tummy
Keep your panties gummy, have you walkin' funny, trick

[Hook x 2]
