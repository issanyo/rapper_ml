[Hook]
While your shuckin' and jivin' I'll be drivin'
Rollin' in my SUV (Westside Nigga)
All my plus three thugs on the way to the club
And when I come you got love for me
Cause I'm a super super star (Staaaar)
You know we're super super star (Staaaar)

[Ice Cube]
Everybody know jail records sell records
I'mma catch a case come to court nigga bail naked
I got the formula double murder equal double platinum
I know these bitch niggas wonderin' why I'm bustin' at em
The rich and famous ignoramus
It's kind of heinous with the picture of the world that he paint us
The most dangerous angriest lyrics that a thug got
Ain't enough nigga where your mug shot?
Where's your drug spot nigga yous a was-not
I can't bump your shit if you never was shot
Before you bust a verse nigga go snatch a purse
You ain't my dogg till you laid up in a hearse
And you'll learn about loyalty when the record company
Try to fuck your family out the royalty
Your number one with a bullet and you took it in the back
Goddamn that nigga can rap

[Hook]

[Mack 10]
Now break me down check my resume tell me what it say
It's the hood or nothing cross em out and put a K
No NO it don't matter how good you spit
If you ain't hit the trauma unit they ain't playin' your shit
Who gives a fuck if your money and game up to par
Cause jail time and bullets make a nigga a star
But it's a shame you ain't gettin' no real ass figures
Got these white kid fools like you some real ass niggas
But most of ya'll is cowards ain't nothin' like me
Cause I'm a Westside motherfucker Inglewood G
And fuck sellin' records if I gotta get murked
I'd rather put my hustle down cook and cut up work
And it ain't but a few real killas and scrappers
And all these so-called gangstas really backpack rappers
And I can care less about a battle with skills
Cause when you bump Mack 10 you get the real reel

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
Fucked up down the game is fucked up now
This new rapper got shot and looked up now nigga
Fuck a peace service soon as Dub hit the surface
I got em shakin' and nervous cause ya'll done created a murderous
Brazen tattoo so blaze the zag fool afraid the gat you
Got my gauge right at you
Fuck Paula Abdul I'm an American Idol
With my album cover posin' with a semi auto rifle
Cause murderin' vital cells and steels ain't real enough
The media wants drama so I ain't givin' a fuck
If I kill me a nigga won't get shot in the heart
I can hit the countdown to one-o-six and park
So bang this shit nigga hang that shit
You say you don't but I know you love this gangsta-shit nigga
Cause bullet holes and record sales go to together
Like cops and radars, ash and A&R

[Ice Cube]
To all my niggas lovin' chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug sellin'
Rap murderous lyrics and story tellin'
You got to be a felon to get your shit sellin'
And if it got to be that way
A nigga murder me a rapper today
It just happened today
So if I come clappin' your way
It's just to sell what a nigga sold back in the day
Bang this and my niggas get dangerous
Bang this with a four five stainless
Bang this and the bitches go brainless
Bang this if you want to be famous
Bang this and my niggas get dangerous
Bang this with a four five stainless
Bang this and the bitches go brainless
Bang this if you want to be famous
