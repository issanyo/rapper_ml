No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I can't see myself like somebody that dont skip skip this way
I keep my kakies creased
And my chucks laced up
Lets take a toast to the struggle so niggas raise yours cups
Ain't no motherfucker breathin on this earth like i do
Come walk in my shoes and sit threw shit that i done been threw
Closed caskets, victums of the block
Can't figure out most of the next lyrics will come back and repost soon!!
