Listen with that, pump the music that and count our money shit, know what I'm saying, yo?
Everywhere I go niggers always ask me the same thang
They wanna know through out the bullshit, how the fuck I maintain, you know what I tell them?
I told them cause I'm a hustler, they wanna know how I made it this far
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard
Somebody tell them I'ma go get them cause I'm a hustler
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard, score
Climbing up the blank range, guess who's back main
Hoov from the stores to the whack, hey
Don't know how to act main, now I got change
Thirty thousands on a prat game wanna start your campaign
Whipping it from the studio where they get you
The good for making something out of nothing like a magician
Dog classified G status working hard
And I bring money back my car exes and garbage jars
Get it from the baking soda to the pick up
But I get it from pushing this cavy through the speakers
And I remember watching the game from the pictures
Broke homie your teeth is now as blue Louie speakers
I look for where the cash lay, our school's our niggers
Who cruise to interstate with the kush in the asstray, get it the fast way
Somebody ask why I live today like my last day
I told them cause I'm a hustler, they wanna know how I made it this far
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard
Somebody tell them I'ma go get them cause I'm a hustler
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard, score
Nino, did you know how my team come, trying to be eco free nigga got a green thumb
Yeah, I'm talking greener than a jet span
Down in the bottom with them marshes and the wetlands
Keep the don't overload
Is it movie I got money now I don't know them whose
I'm high off life ready to overdose, I live the fast life but I got a slow approach
My driveway is like a drive in, I got relationships to move it on high tan
...is the time much quality, and I ain't talking Twitter my nigga, now can you follow me?
I can turn a stack into a hundred g's and I can turn a grammy to a hundred keys
I got the streets wide open, they want me to say how I did it, that's what I told them
I told them cause I'm a hustler, they wanna know how I made it this far
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard
Somebody tell them I'ma go get them cause I'm a hustler
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard, score
Now I can fake it, arras so bullshit but why lie?
These rappers be lying but now they die
I'm a cannon on the side of the dock, stay fly when the smoke is bouncing the car
When I run 95, high round about, itching in the clock side slide turning up the cooler
Turn the road in a hot niggers counting me out, but I
See I can't die, money don't sleep, so why should I?
See this is for my niggers still thirsty shipping the mail, turned up, doing burgers in the jail sales
Zig zag burners in the sofa, chip holders know how to get the apartment flipping over
Stuff the money in the dope for quarter chain in the hustle my little swag in the struggle
I'ma grind till my ashes lay, motherfuckers wanna know why I act this way
I told them cause I'm a hustler, they wanna know how I made it this far
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard
Somebody tell them I'ma go get them cause I'm a hustler
I told them cause I'm a hustler, and everyday I gotta go hard, score
I told them cause I'm a hustler, they wanna know how I made it this far, that's right
And everyday I gotta go hard
Somebody tell them I'ma go get them cause I'm a hustler
And everyday I gotta go hard, score
