[Intro]
Yea
Turn the music up a little bit . . .[*Nate Dogg in background] Dah-dah-daaah
Uh, yea Lah-dah-daaah
A little bit louder . . right there Dah-dah-daaah
[Nate Dogg:] In the name of the streets

[Verse: WC]
Click click bu ya! Dub kicked the frame in (uh huh)
Nigga let the games begin, as I standin'
Tossed the tall can on a campus off the limital
Scanners takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the thick body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Majave
Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon
Escalade 3-braid beard wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me "Home of Cake" cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the seed
I spit in the name of the streets

[Hook: Nate Dogg + WC]
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
This the itty-bitty nigga from the city they call LB
What you know about the D-O-G?
I keep my peeps wit a bag a' treats
On the streets my nephews beat your beat and keep that heat
In the Cutt and indiscrete
Me and Dub-C crippin' couzins in this industry
A lotta' y'all pretend to be
Wanna see friends wit me and then sleep wit the enemy?
Want some, get some, bad enough take some
Suckas poppin' off I'm 'bout to take one
Braids on, make done, don't want none
And just cause we talkin', what you doin' C-Walking?
It's not just a dance it's a way a' living
Now if ya C-Walking, ya best to "see" Crippin'
And that goes for kids too, and R&B singers
Nigga quit Crip-Walking if ya ain't a gang banger

[Hook]

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go
I told another that I want her but she wants to ho
I ain't a hater I'm a player so I fucked 'em both
In the name of the streets

[Verse: Xzibit]
High resolution, high definition
Let the tape roll let the whole world listen
Hold your position, don't go backwards
I'm frontlining and the West keep shining
Fuck wit ya nigga your boy "X" still grindin'
Fuck them other niggas they just high siding
Talking and lie, bitchin' and cry
Gossip and hate but ain't nobody's right
Fuck going diamond if ya make it turn pussy
Don't push me, peep game like a booky
The hook lining singer, the deep thinker
Ego auto-biography beat it nigga ya bother me
Glass hit them hard, take no prisoners
Been choiced for the voice
I speak for my people like a Senator
Raise up, the blunts get blazed up
Swing like a gorilla nigga you ain't a king, c'mon!

[Hook]

[Outro]
[*Nate Dogg in background] Dah-dah-daaah
Yea . . . Lah-dah-daaah
Dub-C . . . Dah-dah-daaah
The "Ghetto Heisman"
[Nate Dogg:] In the name of the streets
Swangin' through a hood near you [*over last line of outro] Dah-dah-daaah
