[Hook - Toofpick]
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you out at the club
Surrounded by thugs, bouncing the Dub, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you ain't in yo hood
Right when them bitch niggas thinking it's good, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When they least expect it
Make the hollow points reach they Lexus, and
Throw Ya Hood Up
You might need 5 keys
Every time you see my face, just
Throw Ya Hood Up

[Verse 1 - WC]
If you're greedy, grimey, janky, sheisty
Just like I see, the 3-time felon
Zig-Zag inhalin, dip for see someone in a rag fifty sham
Throw Ya Hood Up
To all my lil Gs at schools
And homies draped in the county blues
It's Dub-C, the heat, the one who kept the street
Got you C-Walkin in your sleep, all my niazz just
Throw Ya Hood Up
If you a nigga that break the law
Rick scrape the shaw, get paper yall
Give it up, give it up, ryders please
Throw it up, throw it up, a little higher please
Throw Ya Hood Up
I know it hurts when death come outta the well working
Put in work, it ain't a thang, love to bang and swang
And slang them thangs, for the cash and the love for the game
All my niazz just

[Hook - Toofpick]
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you out at the club
Surrounded by thugs, bouncing the Dub, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you ain't in yo hood
Right when them bitch niggas thinking it's good, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When they least expect it
Make the hollow points reach they Lexus, and
Throw Ya Hood Up
You might need 5 keys
Every time you see my face, just
Throw Ya Hood Up

[Verse 2 - WC]
And move your body, put it up to your parties
Banged out and ragged robbies
Throw Ya Hood Up
And pull that weed out
Mid-West, West to East and down South
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you see me, loaded, eyes gleamy
And I stole that Bentley
Throw Ya Hood Up
And toast the liquor
And stretch them fingers for the ghetto lick hitter
Throw Ya Hood Up
And rep yo turf, your set
And salute when you see this connect vet and a blue flannel
Red keys like a piano, half a chicken and a dog panel, ballers
Throw Ya Hood Up
Another world-wide anthem
Lick em, stamp em, wet and damp em
Cus I'm, heading platinum, countin mo' dough
Have to let the nigga, wide-bodied, fo' dough, niazz

[Hook - Toofpick]
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you out at the club
Surrounded by thugs, bouncing the Dub, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you ain't in yo hood
Right when them bitch niggas thinking it's good, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When they least expect it
Make the hollow points reach they Lexus, and
Throw Ya Hood Up
You might need 5 keys
Every time you see my face, just
Throw Ya Hood Up

[Bridge - WC]
And pull that weed out
Mid-West, West to East and down South
Throw Ya Hood Up
Ryders please
Throw it up, throw it up, a little higher please
Throw Ya Hood Up
And pull that weed out
Mid-West, West to East and down South
Throw Ya Hood Up
Sing the anthem, ryders stand up
Throw yo hands up

[Hook x2 - Toofpick]
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you out at the club
Surrounded by thugs, bouncing the Dub, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When you ain't in yo hood
Right when them bitch niggas thinking it's good, just
Throw Ya Hood Up
When they least expect it
Make the hollow points reach they Lexus, and
Throw Ya Hood Up
You might need 5 keys
Every time you see my face, just
Throw Ya Hood Up

[Outro - WC]
That was cool, but, eh my nigga, how this shit sounding?
