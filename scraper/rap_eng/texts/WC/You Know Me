[Chourus]

I roll my good up, In my Khakies
Throw my hood up, keep it OG
You know it mayne, I got the hood with me
I got the hood with me
But these bitches get this money
Got my thang out, keep it on me, you know it mayne
I got the hood with me, I got the hood with me

[Verse 1: WC]
Dub-Cuda, Lick can I get robbin'
Over here we the headbangers like the hit squad..
All chrome with the raw flow, shake up the audience
Like mike vick walking in the dogg show
Like giraffe dicks standing tall over y'all
Hangin' with killas
Like suspenders on overalls, crackin bottles
Swaging n aiming hollows when niggas n solitary confinement
To the game macho..Clack clock nigga keep my shit cocked
Don't fuck with me ya'll I'm in the zone like a zip lock
Stay G'd up, out to get my green up
Blue Chevy,counting bags of money like a brink truck
Guaranteed at least slangin sticks like shina e
Bad bitch on my side, ass like Alicia Keys,feel the breeze
Don't retire nicky please..on the 110 with my dickies to
My knees...

I roll my good up, In my Khakies

You know it mayne, I got the hood with me
I got the hood with me
But these bitches get this money
Got my thang out, keep it on me, you know it mayne
I got the hood with me, I got the hood with me

[Verse 2: Maylay]
Breath of fresh air,yes,yeah it's Maylay nigga, Big Swang
And I came with the Connect Gang members, and uhh
It ain't bright if we ain't light
They ain't shit nigga he ain't tight
You got it fucked up
It's all or nothin', we brawl n bust'em
Till they put me in the coffin of the car and I'm coffed in
And to my next opponent, don't even rest a moment
I'm so West! (Hell Yes!)with no extra's on it
L.A. Dodgers, AK,Choppers and the kids hit the graves
Way before they momma's ( That's a shame ! )
So I rep the hat, yeah you can bet ya that
Capital CA mayne,and check the Tat
Recognise why the realist niggas give it up
Weather they be Crip or Blood, and the one the women love
Angelino..but she's only repect by niggas run from green coats n don't testify

I roll my good up, In my Khakies

You know it mayne, I got the hood with me
I got the hood with me
But these bitches get this money
Got my thang out, keep it on me, you know it mayne
I got the hood with me, I got the hood with me

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Now I'm an old nigga on the Porch, way to big
It's a shame how this nigga influenced them kids
Got 'em out there hustlin' and doin' the shit
And he don't do shit but sit and scratch on his dick
And it's not good that the hood is under a spell
It's a wonder why this nigga ain't under the jail
Why they treat this motherfucka like the wizard of oz
Cause I know what's happening like re-run and rogg
I'm a captain, yep the head nigga in charge
Pull Air Force One, up out the garage
I'm the grand puba You part of my lodge
You mortals better pay, respect to the Gods
You can cuss more, I'm Mount Rushmore
Now you can sell more, You still Al Gore
Nigga I'm the president, you just a resident
In my Gangsta world, and you late with the fucking rent!

I roll my good up, In my Khakies

I got the hood with me
But these bitches get this money
Got my thang out, keep it on me, you know it mayne
I got the hood with me, I got the hood with me
