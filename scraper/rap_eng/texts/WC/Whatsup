First Verse Deuce Fantastick of Peep Game

Your dealing with a southside resident
Yes im fresh as a peppermint
Its evident im so fly feels like im heaven sent
E town represent even thought these haters wanna make me see a deficit
Money i still be getting it
Cause im sick with my sound
Pick her up & im letting her down
She thinks im thinking bout sticking around
She blinks i dip & i skip out of town
Pack to pitching anti leaving the mound
Im bagging it up & im ripping it down
Im talking bought flipping a pound i think that your getting it now
Yeh, im in the booth with the pradas on
Flow hitting you harder than a collision on the autobahn
We making history over here trust me
And when we come around you bow down word to wc
I plan to make dough make money my
Hustle so hard I can be O call me filthy rich you know
You know how I DO been about my chips
Making love to my money yeh we friends with benefits

Second Verse W.C. Of Westside Connection

Fresh off the plane, bandana over my left shoulder
It's the kills Cali hit em up west side roller
West side loc ster c walk toater, anti sober
Colder than an Ice colder
Quick to yeh strap never in my holster
Nine loader
Looking for the Canada eye closer
One puff two puff now I'm choking & focused ready to get party open
Skippng all over the floor with my blue hanki blowing
It's Wc & peep game u ain't knowing
Fire up good ,pour the drank
As I let the ass on my 64 chevy scrape
Dipping in Canada while makers boppers skate
Bumping that street Cause over here it don't stop at drake
Back to make the ground pound
Coming with them loud sounds
Its peep game & Doug Crawford better now down

Chorus

Whastup,…whatsup… whatsup
Gone blow it in the air like whatsup

Third Verse Jay Stacks of Peep Game

My soliders waiting at front
Waiting for the go Ita go time
Finger hit the button watch him hang glide
Got time full of venom as we stretch em for the bejamins
Next atop to church giving usher ray the confessions
Yeh now please forgive him for his sins lord
Bring his head back watch his head hit base board
Game stay sharp like hallie Barrie in fish sword
Think he gone bring it back wait for it
Here the crowd applause skeet in grey porche
Begging for an encore make sure liquids still pouring
For my dead & gone in ground still snoring
I'm only here to keep the flame going
Can't stop whether rain or snowing
They shed a tear Terrell owens
I'm a stay flowing cake stay ground
It's game gang til they kick the door in

Fourth Verse Doug Crawford

Mention the best Canadian rappers an names that exist
If I ain't on that list that's ridiculous
Always thinking dividend but I'm never giving in
Ktf veteran better than iv ever been
People wanna see my fall I won't let em win
That's why I stay fly like g6 tail wind
Officer your making a mistake look
Your daughter simply added me to Facebook
And I'm just learning from things I lost
That my mistakes took
Still getting by dub thanks for good look
Lost count of all women telling me they love me
Rocking stages all over the country
Listened to west side connection all threw high school
I grew up on Wc Mack 10 Ice cube
Can't describe sensation when dreams come true
And you will only hate cause it's something that's you'll never do
