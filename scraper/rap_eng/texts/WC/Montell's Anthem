[Intro]
Yeah
Number five y'all
I'm almost a veteran, heh
Don't think I've ever seen you so good lookin'

Since 1995, I've been flowin' on tracks like this
Got a lot of gold and platinum plaques like this
But I had it up to here, so I'm R&B, bangin' on wax like this
In case you forgot, five times on the streets, I been keepin' it hot
Got your shorty on the block singin' da-da-da-da
And I coulda held back, but will I do that?
Probably not

See I represent Cali and it be's like that
And I'll probably get sampled cuz the track's so phat
The music in the street's gotten out of control
You can't keep a deal unless you're platinum or gold
That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more
Mr. Nice Guy come to even the score
And I'm not holdin' my tongue
Girl you know my name and you know where I'm from

1 -     All y'all fakers, Def Jam haters
R&B, South Central, Westside players
To all my homies that's sittin' on dubs
With your girl in your ride, turn this on up

All y'all fakers, Def Jam haters
R&B, South Central, Westside players
To all my homies on blades and dubs
With your girl in your ride, turn it up, turn it up

The year's 2001, I'm still flowin' on tracks like this
Got a few more gold and platinum plaques like this
I've had it up to here, so I'm R&B, bangin' on wax to this
In case you forgot, the word on the street is I'm keepin' it hot
Everybody on your block singin' da-da-da-da
But I still can't believe after five LP's they could sleep on me

But singers with no skills, singers with no shoes
Singers in bathtubs, is that how you pay due?
The music in the street's gotten out of control
Sell some records then you're out the back door
It's all I can stands, I can't stands no more
Mr. Nice Guy come to even the score
My man Focus blaze the track
And I wrote it, I sang it, I live it, believe dat

Repeat 1

La la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la

[W.C.]
What's crackalatin? (Ladies, Southside bobbin bobberlers)
Cristal, Dom P, and Hennessy gobblers
It's the ruggedest, thuggist hoppin out the six hundred
Holdin ya ears ransom bangin Montell's Anthem, nia
Back fo' mo', wit anotha platinum fo' sho'
Y'all just video ballin, we've been stackin doe -
Packin dance floors gettin busy
The originals, Montell and Dub-C
From tha home of the sticky-icky

Repeat 1
