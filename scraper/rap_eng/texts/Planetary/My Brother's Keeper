[Verse 1: Planetary]
I ain’t never worship the Devil
I’m always cursing in churches, my mother heard I’m a rebel
I ran like a rebel, in 89, no baby nine
Only weapon I had was a crazy rhyme
But now it’s the 2010 era
Where I ain’t even gotta use a pen to bend letters
And you can listen to that, I recommend better
How about the Army of the Pharaohs rap trend setters
You see my endeavors are bound to end eras
My syllable send terror, you killable men tear up
I heard there’s faggots I could find you with
So don’t forget I spit shit to leave him swine flu sick
Let me remind you quick, I’m 2-1-5
Killadel county count me in I run through clicks
I can take em back to battling, my javelin jagged
I man handle ‘em, call me rap’s Marilyn Manson
I’m dancing with demons with decorated pants from them bleeding
Blasting your regions with poetry and passionate teaching
The music is leaking, it’s seeping thru the pores on tour
Still raw, still swarming with the “Storm of Swords”

[Hook]
Blood in, blood out
We run into this game until it runs out
Blood in, blood out
Am I my brother’s keeper? No doubt

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
My life on trial, ya’ll testify
My wife don’t smile, then she can slide
I don’t bite my tongue, don’t need replies
I eat cyanide before I eat my pride
Tell G “you and me”, tell Nick “you and I”
Against the world, the rest can fly
In Hell’s kitchen I baked that pie I provide
And thru them hope is kept alive
So who gonna ride when I cock it and name it
Homicide, murder, what’s the case that they gave them
Blood in my pen, dues I done paid them
Been through a lot, trials tribulation
The man in the mirror? Am I talking to Satan?
If I choose to sleep, who gonna wake them?
In this mental prison my views have escaped
I live reality, dreams I don’t chase them
Loyalty is questioned when Judas is waiting
Suicidal thoughts, who can erase them?
The glass is hourless, time keeps on wasting
I’m a psycho killer in a hospital pacing
