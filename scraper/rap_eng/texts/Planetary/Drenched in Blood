[Planetary]
I can’t imagine me slacking, it’s like a nigga stepping
And slapping me right in the face but nigga it never happen
I spit the Passion of Christ, the crucifixion’s my weapon
I take the shield from the knight and stick it through your intestines
And that’s just in day’s work
My motivation killing sincerely taken from day’s hurt
I spray earth with the venomous mind spray
It’s a hard knock life before Jay left Beyonce
All-white green leather Diamante
Windows tinted, y’all sit timid acting Kanye
You so stranje I’m throwing boomerangs at your foolish gang
Overruled…

[Demoz]
Motherfucker you a faggot, you kiss niggas like Lil’ Wayne
I’m Kool G in his prime, you niggas rapping like Lil’ Zane
I don’t two-step, nigga I move wet
Cocaine, ecstasy and carry two jets
Now if it wasn’t for my seed I wouldn’t need my life
Give me a hoodie and the mask, I don’t need the ice
I keep verses in my head, I don’t need to write
Left hook split your shit open, I don’t need a knife
I’m on my hate shit, AK shit
Step on my shoes, I shoot you in the face bitch
So what the fuck is up? You niggas fucking up
When Vinnie swing on you I swing on you nigga I fuck you up

[Crypt the Warchild]
They all mistaking kindness for weakness
They all bitches spineless and speechless
Work all week and you poor by the weekend
Jerks wanna creep try to choke you while you sleeping
All cause we spit raw, no if there’s a leak and
Everybody quick draw, we know when you reaching
Niggas done fucked up, they woke up a demon
OT possessing having spoke to a deacon
Hypocrite kids keep a hold on the preaching
Please don’t get split, they don’t know what’s the reason
Philly’s like Hell but it’s cold and it’s freezing
24/7 no matter what the season

[King Syze]
Yeah put me in the booth surrounded by music
I let my lips go man like I don’t give two shits
You Internet motherfuckers wish y’all was me
On the road with the Army rolling with QD
While we be touring y’all be at work whoring
Begging for overtime, “Please can I get some more?”
Been there, done that, matter fact still doing it
Took some time but we running with this music shit
Say my name man and I’ll show up
Hit a nigga in the gut till his ass blow up
And I still speak power with the force of an anvil
I spit gutter words fill another landfill

[Vinnie Paz]
I murder anyone who fuck with the villain, it’s over
You ain’t American Gangster cause you chilling with Hova
I got a motherfucking chip and it’s still in my shoulder
I dump the motherfucking clip in your grill and I fold you
You ain’t even in my league and on Vinnie dick
I’m eating calamari and capocoolo with my ginny clique
I’m a Sicilian mastiff, you a mini pit
Eleven Mac 11, nine 9s, on that Biggie shit
I hug the block with Jay and Moss where that rocko was sold
I carry four burners like the top of a stove
2012 when y’all burn, that’s what prophecy’s told
I don’t give a fuck, I ain’t expect to see thirty years old
