[Verse 1: Planetary]
I ain't new to the game faggot, I been rappin'
You tell lies in the booth, that means you been actin'
I been smashin' on this mic, I been spazzin'
I'm completely focused motherfucker, distraction
My hand is steady when the four fifth lift at 'em, shit happens when you faggot niggas hear the click clackin
911 call em up keep 'em dispatchin, that means you talk to police and speak pig latin
I'm done with it all, I move past you petty haters
Gun to your jaw, you ready, you can meet your maker
I'm a man of god but I don't need a savior
I do my dirt all up on my lonely, I don't need a favor
Fuck a bitch, fuck 'em all nigga, fuck the world
I'm good by myself little boy and little girl, I made my bed so y'all pay the consequence
I got devils in my head sayin' I gotta vent, I got an angel on my shoulder say I should repent
But the devil keeps on winnin' 'cause I'm kinda bent
I'm coming for blood, I'm broke I don't got a cent, so don't be brave, have a little common sense

[Chorus: Crypt the Warchild]
Everything is everything, pulling out them heavy things
The official pistol gang, clutching the machete swing
Outerspace can turn your brain to spaghetti rings, anything
Bring the guillotine, we behead the kings

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
What you retarded or something? I leave you heartless if nothing
If anything I leave you wheezin' in your coffin for frontin'
For real I'm the fuego, and the bullets hasta luego
Every syllable scorch ya, every word like waco, every verse fatal
I ain't votin' for pedro, I vote for the niggas that put pesos in my payroll, yup
I'm Chase Utley with the louisville, swingin' at the labels 'cause they want me signing stupid deals, for real?
This shit be irritating me, I feel like Rikers Island 'cause the demons ain't escaping me, now
I need a new eight to squeeze, hate to see the paper freeze
Too much on the plate for me, full course meal, bulldozin' through the forcefield, fool's dozin' off, ho's and altar boys still
You need to duck now, avoid the ricochet
We makin' them hits nigga, you hittin the triple blades(?)
Niggas say I leave your district in disarray, you dissin but nigga I don't hear your diss gettin' played
My flow Fiji, my voice trample your tipi, every sample dismantled and leave you greener than kiwi

[Chorus: Crypt the Warchild]
Everything is everything, pulling out them heavy things
The official pistol gang, clutching the machete swing
Outerspace can turn your brain to spaghetti rings, anything
Bring the guillotine, we behead the kings
