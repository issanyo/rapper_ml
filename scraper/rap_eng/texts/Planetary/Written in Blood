[Intro]
This shit written in blood nigga...
LIVE LIFE AFTER DEATH AND THEN YOUR SOUL PERISH

[Verse 1: Planetary]
Man if I ain’t trying to live
Something gotta give
Can’t die with four kids
Time to get off the bridge
Roses turn black when the rain fall
Sunshine make the moon rise, city look like an eightball
Lazy niggas get praised for they hard work
Hard work is getting paid less than they all worth
Rap is a dream, now it turn to nightmares
Wack shit get the airplay every night here
Feel like the east coast down south
And the west is my home, showing love all around no doubt
We out, support from the fans
Then red eye to meet my whole Jedi family
Peace to violent when the war's sustained
Like people enjoy hearing love turning into pain
Hugs turns to shame, the ride gets rougher
Even though the money right, still life gets tougher
More money, more problems they say
Big died rich, right things go the wrong way
And love don’t pay so now I gotta hate rap
Take that, watch the blood drip off the ADAT

[Hook]
You can live or die, be seen or be vanish
How can you be so blind and still see havoc
How could you say you fear nothing with no courage
LIVE LIFE AFTER DEATH AND THEN YOUR SOUL PERISH

You can live or die, be seen or be vanish
How can you be so blind and still see havoc
How could you say you fear nothing with no courage
LIVE LIFE AFTER DEATH AND THEN YOUR SOUL PERISH

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
They throw stones at me, they call me Christ
I feel hatred coming from all walks of life
I'm a general betrayed by his lieutenant
I’m a victim to a snitch for reduced sentence
I'm a runaway slave in a dark alley
Pitchfork, sickle, machete, until the Lord catch me
I'm a king that's surrounded by loyal knights
I got soldiers that'll die when the time is right
I got the best of both worlds so I'm level headed
I feel love, feel hate and I don't regret it
I've had hopes and dreams that were crazy crushed
I've been blessed by God, I embrace the touch
I expect the worst, appreciate the best
I drink away my pain, alleviate my stress
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm wrong, I'm right
I'm the new day that dawns when you say "Good night"
I've been put to rest and then resurrected
I'm been praised by many and then felt neglected
Hung out to dry but I'm well protected
I don't poli much, but I'm well connected

[Hook]
You can live or die, be seen or be vanish
How can you be so blind and still see havoc
How could you say you fear nothing with no courage
LIVE LIFE AFTER DEATH AND THEN YOUR SOUL PERISH

You can live or die, be seen or be vanish
How can you be so blind and still see havoc
How could you say you fear nothing with no courage
LIVE LIFE AFTER DEATH AND THEN YOUR SOUL PERISH
