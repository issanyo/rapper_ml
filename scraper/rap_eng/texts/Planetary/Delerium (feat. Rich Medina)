Often my Delerium is so strong that I can't dance to the music
Or walk the line between my drums and everyone else’s'
Attempting to shoot down the sun with a slingshot and bad aim
Got me missing the point and, losing my religion hand to hand, shit...

So I rock the cradle with menstrual speak
Buck my eyes and show my teeth when the lights come on
Cause no matter what the deal, I want my money up front, preferably in small bills, cause
Fat knots draw honeys like horseflies to the dung-pile by the fence

At first it was a game, smoking weed and drinking to see who dropped first
But as the world knows, crazy crew usually ends up making play-time serious
Now-a day, skills don't pay big bills
Better to go get a gimmick, and cook a top dollar video over the fire, yea...
Sample the left vaudeville, y'all...

Sucka-time succotash for the consumer
AKA niggers with no leaders to listen to
Lovers with no one to make love to
Dreamers with no place to sleep
Countries that got no choice but to rely on young Miss United States and her fast ass
Police woman of the first, second and third worlds
See, we simply request OUR oil, ahead of schedule
And we just might drop some scuds on your ass too
We don't give a fuck
'Long as we got the biggest gats on the planet
Take a so-called civilized photocopy and scan it
Cause we've been...
Blowing up other people's shit up since before it was a trend

And now there ain't no such thing as nationalism
Now niggers can ride on TOP of the bus if they damn well please
And brothers instead get Greek and snatch women’s' clothes off
Like frisky drunk-ass DT's under summer sun

Belly flopping in the waters are more primitive ways. Cause
Dirty sex on video pays these days. And
Niggas got a way of making slow money fast
Writing checks they ass can't cash. Like
Mystical probe-like rhetoric, not payin' the rent. And
You know come 2000 internet hell gonna catch the chills and repent. So
Save as much as you can on driving hard
Cause you're gonna need this information down the road, bro

Standing freshly dipped and educatly spoken, he approached
Perched like a monster
And the world cried
