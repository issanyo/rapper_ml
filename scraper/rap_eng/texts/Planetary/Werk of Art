[Mesidge]
They got it wrong
They just lost in the bullshit
Mess one and planetary gunning with full clips
They ain't touching nothing but the tip of my blade
I'ma make 'em feel my fury when this sick[?] hits the page
No southern cali to Philly we serving up steady
These MC's ain't ready yo my words are too deadly
I'm lethal on mic's stand up for me people and fight
Cause my path will turn your light to the evilest night (that's right)
I'm outstanding thunderous reps
I spit it to rock your dome you're gonna collapse
Once my lyrics hit quick split your chest right in two
MC Mes from the west yo I thought that you knew
I'ma keep my head high with my fist in the sky
To let you know we ready for war so get ready to die
Get ready to fry from the plane that I spit its insane
A lion that can't be tamed plus sick in the brain

[Chorus]
Yo this is my werk of art
Tearing rappers apart
My flow is too sharp
Most of cats lacking the heart
Get attacked in the dark
That's when I come out to slay
If you don't wanna die today
Then get the fuck out of my way

[Planetary]
I'm on my first flight back to cali
80 gig stack that girl named Sally
My man mes once scooped me up at an alley
Now we wildin' like paz at the Mumia rally
Bandana ski mask perfect got a heat blast
Type of cat making everybody flee crash
Y'all don't see cash me I got machinery
To separate doves half of men and the b's for me
This rap shit used to be like a dream to me
Now I'm realistic and the thoughts obscene to me
So I spit 16's leisurely
Legally distribute the crack on track easily nigga
Outerspace man we ride for the fuck of it
Hydraulic bounce speakers in the trunk bustin' shit
My blood pump hardcore liquor
Planetary in this joint with mesidge and -

[Chorus]
Yo this is my werk of art
Tearing rappers apart
My flow is too sharp
Most of cats lacking the heart
Get attacked in the dark
That's when I come out to slay
If you don't wanna die today
Then get the fuck out of my way

[Planetary]
Before Planetary
Im'a taught 'em with lyrics
I make legends hit the pen and pan and all of 'em fear us
I'm a cut above the rest of 'em
My poetic pendulum
Extinguish you wannabe fire raps
Bash your melon in
I'm sick with it bitches feeding me advil
Different from them niggas out hustling crack deals
Here I flow add fuel to the fire
If the sound crash the mes got loose in the wires

[Mesidge]
The beast mes one so vicious with pens
I spit that real you rap about bitches and rims
Get it right, you fucking with the villain on his mic
I got my man Plan and we swinging swords in the fight
Razor blade rhymes slicing your flesh
It's lights out pussy no life after death
Two of the sickest MC's blessing the track
So you better stand back cause we came to attack

[Chorus]
Yo this is my werk of art
Tearing rappers apart
My flow is too sharp
Most of cats lacking the heart
Get attacked in the dark
That's when I come out to slay
If you don't wanna die today
Then get the fuck out of my way
