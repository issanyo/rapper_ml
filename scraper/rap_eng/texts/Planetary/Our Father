Yeah, ooh, ok listen, yeah

[Crypt the Warchild]
I never claimed to be a Saint, nah that ain't me
I'm only saying what I ain't, you should let me be
I'ma always throw stones if my house is made of glass
Watch this jealous one envy, everybody feel my wrath
I've done a lot of wrong in this time and place
I take many days for granted, I despise, I hate
I'm a liar, I steal if it presents itself
I stab a nigga in the back if it affects my wealth
I cut a throat, burn a bridge if it makes me grow
Spit in the face of many people I thought you should know
But I doubt you'll understand cause you claim you perfect
I've committed many sins in this place that's worthless
Can't reconcile what I've started or express my sorrow
Don't give a fuck about today if there's no tomorrow
And I don't believe if you die that your soul lives on
When you're six feet in the hole that means you're dead and gon'
But there's a lil' part inside me that believes you there
The same part inside me that believes you care
Outta' my mind that's what they say man I got to be
If there's a place in God's Kingdom save a spot for me
Our Father

[Chorus]
When I don't know what I'm suppose to do
I hit my knees and I pray to you
'Cause we don't always believe in you
But one day we gonna know the truth

My grandmother just died I watched mom cry hysterical
Unbearable pain, tried to help, I felt terrible
Tears dressed her heart, when that casket arose
A white rose was handed out as we prayed for her soul
Grandpa said she a champion, heaven her trophy
That was the realest shit I heard in my life
My brothers hold me I'm falling
God I hope you're watching, I hope you're listening
A loss of life that stands so close can get sickening
What's even worst to me she ain't never met my kids
And that's something I'ma always regret long as I live
But a kiss from my mother and my wife back home
Will always mend my scars anytime I'm feeling alone
A hug from my sons always make me complete
The love I get from my niggas hold me down in the heat
I hope life is everlasting when you're under the dirt
'Cause she wanted to see her son and twins that died at birth
Our Father

[Chorus]
When I don't know what I'm suppose to do
I hit my knees and I pray to you
'Cause we don't always believe in you
But one day we gonna know the truth
Tell the ones that you took away
I know you're all in a better place
One day I'ma see your face
'Cause there's a better way
When I don't know what I'm suppose to do
I hit my knees and I pray to you
'Cause we don't always believe in you
But one day we gonna know the truth
But one day we gonna know the truth
