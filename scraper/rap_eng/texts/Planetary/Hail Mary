[Verse 1: Planetary]
Uh, we in Seattle wit Mack the Knife and the Pharaohs
We loaded with double barrels and all the cipher an' apparel
We bangin' the Lost Battles, and everything is a gamble
'Sour Diesel', That raw perico, wrapped from the gravel
We travel a vicious cycle from Illadelph to the Eiffel
My wife will walk wit a rifle, if I ask her to snipe you
Best believe the shit on my sleeve reppin' what I'm here for
Therefore, my arm extends to who I'm here for
I'm still raw still spittin' and workin' hard
Like King Syze walkin' thru them 'Labor Union' doors
Its real, conceal a weapon till the day of the election
When Bush gone it's on, I'm lickin' at his direction
Spittin' it to perfection, my ghetto report card A plus
Lay plush, new Chuckers laced up. Gritty!
Shitty Saturdays, jewels look like gamma rays
I'm Bobby Knight with a mic in his Indiana days
Atlanta Braves tomahawkin' your parade
I fuck wit Phillies! "What you silly nigga!"
Watch what you say (I smack the shit out you)
We ducktapin' whoeva the fuck hatin'
We leaving no prisoners, I'm a sinister son sacred

[Chorus: Planetary]
Hail Mary full of grace
Praise that the Lord be with us when we walking through space!
Bless it, are those who rose to step in our face
We gotta get 'em, I hope they in a better place, got 'em
Hail Mary full of grace
Praise that the Lord be with us when we walking through space
Bless it, are those who rose to step in our face
We gotta get 'em, I hope they in a better place

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
Nah, y'all ain't hear me on Gun Ballad or Black Christmas
Or Bloody Tears, I was busy handling my business
Me and Planet the same but we a little different
Back in the booth like we left something missing
Back wit the truth I pray to God you niggas listening
Stack to the roof like pyramids but ain't Egyptian
Use the mic as a brush to paint this diction
They gotta quarantine the lab they say we sickening
Music is like cook raw we blazed the kitchen
We got love worldwide amazing isn't it?
We Blood Brothers from another father, another mother
Rhyme guzzlers son touch us and ain't no one above us
Who put in work like us and who the fuck can judge us
We change it up a bit don't understand what's all the fuss is
We make it happen; we persevered through all the weather
We Puerto Ricans so we accustomed to do whatever it takes
We stand firm, we stay together
OuterSpace that set in stone and remains forever
QD for life, for worst, for better
I got a hunger for blood and I thirst for cheddar

[Chorus: Planetary] x2
Hail Mary full of grace
Praise that the Lord be with us when we walking through space
Bless it, are those who rose to step in our face
We gotta get 'em, I hope they in a better place, got 'em
Hail Mary full of grace
Praise that the Lord be with us when we walking through space
Bless it, are those who rose to step in our face
We gotta get 'em, I hope they in a better place, got 'em
