[Intro]
Let's go!
Space Pyscho Realm shit
I know ya'll hating!

[Hook x2 - Abidiel]
Soy un boxeador de la calle, tira y no falles
Puede ser que mi veneno te desmaye
Lo de vivir en la calle es el detalle para hacerlo como yo
Para hacerlo como yo ser√° mejor que ensayes

[Planetary]
Yo, I called Sick Jacken and told that nigga I'm sick of rapping
He told me to find all the hatahs plan and get the clapping
I'm sick of yapping I told Cynic let's get the mashing
We on the flight to LA squeaking in the ratchets
Security on me like its 9/11, you betta find the Reverend
Call your fam up and try to find a blessing
No time for stressing only maculate versions
You niggas bitching put your tampons back in your purses
Shit, if Psycho betta buck down we matching the wages
We collide wit the unit and put it back in your faces
Nigga, back to the basics, I'm lacing my Chuck Taylors
Who proposed to the game, now I'm getting my tux tailored
I treat every stage like the Garden of Eden
I'm the serpent in the trees that'll stop you from breathing
The vocal, pato loco from Illadel to Acapulco
The local is locked; time to lick a shot to rock the global

[Sick Jacken]
And I read the puto thru my recital it's suicidal
Accu cycle banks so heavy that we ruin idols
And I ain't fucking wit this new arrivals
Man I been leaking off and on since the days of the unit rhinos
You rival the pussy I'm cocky they push me
I'm vynl who said, there ain't no future for minor whino
I wanna leave shit stained in the rap game
So I got a sick as clique wit the wrath of Kane
You know the name Psycho's run it like its nutting mayne
Where the million bald heads looking like fucking gangs
Worldwide symphony killing spree wit a guillotine
The shit is getting sick after clicking up wit the Philly team
My heroin rap keeps stem going back for the trap
I tap a vein, Jacks is the insane brain of the camp
We run shit like when Hussein reigned
It's the art of execution and we shoot you sane

[Hook]

[Duke]
Yeah, you can still catch me out in the streets, blazed up
You know we deep and keep running them up
I try to chill so we put the guns down
But the streets got us by the balls
Shit, it's hard not to gun out
Police keep hunting us down, they after me
Fucking swine, they ain't got nutting to offer me
We pirates in all black, bagged wit big gats
If they want some we can leave 'em rightfully stance
So that's what the fucks up (What's that?)
I keep wilding like I don't travel about the world getting my cocked sucked
I try to cool out, my goons go out, they repping that shit
The SS gun and burn down the house, take ova the place
We here for good, the shit could get scary
Like 2012 we just ain't ready
We all need to learn not sit around ready to die
Fuck that, we gonna replenish the Earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
We spit a venomous verse your head will just burst
From Pekoe to Puerto Rico we protecting our turf
So be easy you're dealing wit Made-men
Who do dirt dolo and lyrically spray gems
Digital mayhem thru the G-5 and monitors
Rhyme writ, hieroglyph you can't follow 'em
Mind spit designed sick, I start marketing
Mic booth set on fire, who let the arson in?
Your man got a froggy feeling you betta talk to 'em
Pipe bomb filled wit glass to leave 'em sparkling
Right psalms build to last watch me inside of them
Vomiting, street crash you faggots modeling
You run way bitch, walk I keep 'em wobbling
That gun play let you talk who keeps you swallowing
Blood mugs filled to the top it don't belong to him
That's why they're raising their arms singing the song wit him

[Hook]
