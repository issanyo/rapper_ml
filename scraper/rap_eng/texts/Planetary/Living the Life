[Crypt the Warchild]
Uh, we Puerto Roc wit bandanas and bad grammar
Bad manners, pack daggers, we like to thrash hammers
Display raw, we ain't gotta pay straw
We ain't gotta play hockey just to faceoff
We ain't gotta play Rocky just to break jaws
Lotta niggas claim they Gotti but they ain't Mob
Train hard in the battlefield black mask or the shield
Niggas think their flash or steel will get you mass appeal
Suckaz need bodyguards and that's the real
So we in tuned me and Army we rep familia
Niggas out to get signed I trash your deal
Your Record Label suck dick that's stamped and sealed
You closet fans got shit you can't reveal
I'm in the trenches, play the post, playing pass the pill
I throw bows, throw flows, I can't just chill
I need change in the game I rap, I steal

(Chorus) Planetary 2x [2nd time change QD to AOTP]
We live, we living, we living the life
It's our time, we shine, cuz the timing is right
My mic, my niggas get it popping tonight
You see QD, dawg we riding for life

[Planetary]
Yo, you can catch Planetary wit the north face
Court case thrown out, make a nigga boss pace
Celebrate henny fifth, laced out penny shit
Lawyer on some petty skeed up, too heavy shit
Monopoly money, I'd rather play wit property money
Instead of the FEDS, it's always gon' be watching me money
I'm too popular dunny, you on the chopper wit bunnies
I'm in the custom made Pharaoh Helicopter wit dummies
Counting moola's, surrounded by a thousand computers
My PayPal is laced now, cuz I'm the sound of the future
I put it down in Medusa; you can crown me the ruler
The bass quake, now I'm waiting for the ground to maneuver
I put it down wit some shooters; they don't allow me to shoot up
They don't let me Joe Pesci cuz I poly the movers
To the top of the game looking down on the lames
It's QD in this bitch, Doap popping them thangs

(Chorus) Planetary 2x
