[Verse 1]
Murder capital, rap Philly’s a new city
Sharpened crease on the Dickies for the new yiddy
New fitty on the top pops move with me
New pair I never seen, drop two-fifty
Nigga cruise with me, I move fast now
I spit rapid fire past the cloud
Blast em out, massive style, beware of the space shuttle
Bathing apes won’t help me escape the jungle
I bet ? I can dump and kill
Fuck bills but believe every month is real
I’m the type that can live for the day
So if I borrow tomorrow that’s the price a nigga gotta pay
I treat hard days like a holiday
So holla back, I’mma holla when the sky is grey
For life I’mma rap till my dying day
My mind spray, my nine spray

[Chorus]
It’s time to divide the men from boys
Who speak the truth, who’s the real McCoy?
Who locks shit down? Who paid their dues?
Who got them heaters like you say you do?
It’s time to divide the men from boys
Who speak the truth, who’s the real McCoy?
Who locks shit down? Who paid their dues?
Who got them heaters like you say you do?

[Verse 2]
Yo we moving on, there’s no blood, no ashes
We still brothers, ain’t nothing gonna pass us
We ain’t on the same level or bracket
Take a few shots of Hen just to settle the savage
Nigga the new album is a gift, got a curse
You’s a bitch with a switch, lipstick, got a purse
Have em all praise Crypt, let em sing out at church
Or I might have to bring out the hearse
For what it’s worth I’m not a blood, not a crip, I don’t play no turf
I wreak havoc worldwide try to claim this earth
OS for life nigga, Plan’s my ace
Doing a lifetime bid, no plans to escape
Y’all act like women, I’ll slap you in the face
Pimp slap you like a bitch and let it come from the waist
So don’t go there, the show there, I slow there
Suffocate you faggot rappers, no air

[Chorus]
It’s time to divide the men from boys
Who speak the truth, who’s the real McCoy?
Who locks shit down? Who paid their dues?
Who got them heaters like you say you do?
It’s time to divide the men from boys
Who speak the truth, who’s the real McCoy?
Who locks shit down? Who paid their dues?
Who got them heaters like you say you do?
