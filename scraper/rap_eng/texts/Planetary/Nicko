[Crypt the Warchild]
When you came into my life you changed my world
You made an impact on everything you made me thoro
I learned to appreciate what a blessing is
And I will try to right my wrongs for all the fucked up things I did
Best feeling in the world when I brought you home
Put you in that nursery; Papi that's home
I neva thought in my life I eva felt so strong
Neva thought things twice, when it was on it's on
I tried to give you the best and that's above beyond
I'll work like a slave to keep the lights on
And as long as I'm around you won't need for nothing
Daddy always put it down, you won't need for nothing
Follow my footsteps; I will walk you thru it
When you stuck and feel alone, I will talk you thru it
When other people say they can't, I can do it
Do anything you ask Papi, I can prove it

(Chorus) 2x Crypt
Nicko my baby boy you are my everything
And I'mma ride for you put that on anything
You are my life, my world, that's my everything
Nicko my baby boy everything is everything

[Crypt the Warchild]
And now a year dun passed and you were starting to change
You developed a personality somewhat strange
I'm gon' crazy trying to pinpoint the problems
Overwhelmed by the situation, I can't solve 'em
Didn't understand why you just kept crying
Mami was going nuts Papi I ain't lying
Public appearances they seem so grim
Frustrated by your surroundings you can't win
Neva in my life I eva pictured this
I regret being a father, what type of shit is this
I use to spend mad nights Heineken and Henny
Use to drown all my sorrows and my fears were plenty
And now me and Mami we starting to stray
Putting blame on each other, regarding our ways
Let's turn this house into a Church, starting to pray
This read can do that flame Ma starting today

(Chorus) 2x Crypt

[Crypt the Warchild]
And I can see now that the picture's clear
The rainy days are gon' it's sunny up in here
I just realized that you needed help
And I apologize for them bad things I felt
I understand you don't play like other children
I now know you have trouble expressing feelings
And I don't blame you cuz you ain't know
So I will sacrifice anything to see you grow
And you don't learn from us we learn thru you
And that flame when me and Mami it burns thru you
I love everything about you, your smile, your laughter
You were blessed by God, no Priest, no Pastor
We go against all odds, we achieve things faster
We grow like a fam, no recipe for disaster
I give you the world and everything you wanna
And the same goes for Mami and Gianna

(Chorus) 2x Crypt
