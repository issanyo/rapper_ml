[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
This ain’t no sing along music for you to ride up on
This here is street massacre, music to dump on
These lines are sharp, hollow head'll splatter your abdomen
You sick to your stomach, wondering what is happening
Marksman specialist to keep your regiment vanishing
Full metal jacket devious when it's crashing in
Platinum metal this, [?]
151 rolled up, we keep 'em panicking
You in the wrong district, claiming you all misfit
You never toss biscuits, you with the Lord, snitching
I say you all bitching, you up in God's kitchen
Big flame, burn off your face then leave the balls dripping
You all squad victim, up in the dark prison
And you done lost vision, I'm at the bar drinking
You ain't at all spitting close to curtain
This is Illadelph to Rock City
Death is certain

[Hook & Scratches]
You know we rock this, yeah we got this
From Illadelph to Rock City with the hotness
You know it's on and popping
Once we get to popping
We air 'em out, no doubt
Kwest get to chopping

[Verse 2: Planetary]
It's Planetary baby, dog I'm outrageous
My status: the baddest, every time I'm blessing the stages
My blood is the ink, caressing the pages
We gon' do it 'til the world say "OS is the greatest"
I take time out, I'm obscene, I got dreams
Efficient hot beams where the cops scheme
I'm too dangerous, I make a name for this
I guarantee you'll be bleeding, don't try to aim at this
I'm so nuts for the beat, ain't no escaping this
I'm a demon, intoxicated, your favorite
I take steps towards Armageddon, armed with weapons
A few grenades and flash-bombs, call your henchmen
I'm a sniper targeting those who violate
I make music, my roots started the fire escapes
I see you lie at your weight and can't help but laugh
It ain't right, but dead bodies they get me gassed

[Hook & Scratches]
You know we rock this, yeah we got this
From Illadelph to Rock City with the hotness
You know it's on and popping
Once we get to popping
We air 'em out, no doubt
Kwest get to chopping

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah, nickle nigga, I'm up in the office
Chilling, giving orders nigga, I fuck with them bosses
Enough for this talking, if I ain't here to be dying or lying it big
I retire a pioneer, but I do not slip off some hip hop shit
Big Glock and popping, it's only with the hot hip
The white five with the pipe job
Looking like Guy coming from out of the smoke
With the Christ eyes
I ain't no nice guy and I don't like lies
I put my foot in your ass, now you a tripod
I handle my hands like mama swinging
I knock your ass into next week like a time machine and I
Got up with Preem, we pounding out somebody that's mean
Y'all bowing down like I shot at a scene
Which y'all niggas can stay on y'all knees
We stay on our P's, we write on our Q's
Nigga, I prey when I squeeze
