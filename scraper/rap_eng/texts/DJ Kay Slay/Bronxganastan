[Intro]
"Its been my dream to play in a band in New York City"
"This ain't New York, this the Bronx"

Uh huh
Welcome, to Bronxganastan
You already know Cash
CASH MOB
Let's go

[Verse 1: Sire Castro]
I grew up in the Bronx
It was harder than a mother-
For that rent to get paid by my father and my mother
And when I watch 'em struggle, I went harder than a mother-
Now the crib that we 'bout to get is larger than a-
The X taught me everything, ain't talking about no Malcom
Them young boys'll kill you silently just for shouting
They just want the income, don't care about the outcome
Jail don't scare them, and death won't re-route them
They on a route to destruction
I just keep my head up and stay grounded in my constructions
Ice grills don't scare us, we move different
That Screwface only gon' make your face need screws in it
Ain't nothing nice 'round these parts
Deep waters different bites from these sharks
To keep it real you need heart and street smarts (For what?)
To try to stand a chance, in Bronxganastan

[Hook]
Bronxganastan, Bronxganastan
I'm from the Bronx where them homies let them cannons blam (x3)
Bronxganastan, Bronxganastan
I'm from uh, I'm from the Boogie Down nigga

[Bridge: Oun P]
Walk with me
Hell on earth

[Verse 2: Oun P]
Yo, spark the dutch let the smoke clouds fill the room
I'm a time bomb, any minute I could boom
I been Gucci since the 90's like Tom Ford
30-30 from the balcony like Harvey Oswald
People say the grass is greener on the other side
Never switch, get rich, bitch nigga run and hide
Even though I'm the illest in the Milky Way
Still gotta chase skrilla nigga, so the bills get paid
My competition wish they murder me soon
They heard I got, more wait than an Emergency room
I'm the man, I got all across the planet fans
And punks can't stand a chance out in Bronxganastan
Damn Sire, flow burn like a campfire
Shit that I be writing they be biting like a vampire
I be in the jungle, flipping tree like Tarzan
How you on the cloud I be loud like a garage band

[Hook] x2
Bronxganastan, Bronxganastan
I'm from the Bronx where them homies let them cannons blam (x3)
Bronxganastan, Bronxganastan
I'm from uh, I'm from the Boogie Down nigga
