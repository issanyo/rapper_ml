[Verse 1]
Yow, I be making Dane from different races (yeah)
Taking Plans to different places, in a terrain, champagne we sipping cases
Celebrating, cause we elevating, see these lame niggas in it
But we never hating, we just crack jokes at all these wack folkes
Stack notes, swimming in your bitch , doing back strokes
Pack toast, my mac roast, from them snakes that like to act close
I can't stomach the fake shit like am lactose intolerant
Bad bitch you see me and they hollering, BV's on the callering
See me am bringing dollars in (money)
On a lookout for detees and am palloring, and we throw the biggest cookouts
Cause see me, I got a following (come on), and drops on my neck freezing
Mixtape bout to drop and my album coming next season (next season)
Am the best breathing (best breathing), me and my niggas Devious in the Lex breezing
Vroom (vroom, vroom)

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was mans and be my drop tops
Rollie on, middle of the hall, my Nike, High tops
Started in the road, now we watch the game from the skybox
Have they setters gone for thirty, am thinking why not (why not)
Having conversations, we popping over mojitos
They said he out the game can't afford to live with no C.O's
In his 40's now, Telling me all this shit, that only he know
Smile about the times he had bitches and bussing cliko
The moral is, the nigga is been losing fast as he get it
To work hard and watch for the suckers handle your business
Rather control my temperature, the Preacher told me hell's hot
Bilisdigo, coke can white, looking like shell tops
Rob a nigga gold, get the money, smoking in them real spot
Making sales, mamma taught I was checking the mailbox
God gave me a gift to tell my story, niggas guess what? (What?)
Bucki baking soda, next stop, the best stop

[Verse 3]
I was born that gray era
Mommy gave birth to a change, I was raised in the methor
Few blocks away Malcolm died giving his lecture
That's why when I perform I'm always holding a ecklar
But cut four foot for the eckler's, throw a bottle on my stage
I bet you need more than a stretcher (bet that)
When I lose you better make the respect yuh
I put a few niggas in coma for talking reckless
I'm telling my niggas now, keep my name out your rackets
Or they go have to identify you by dental records (warning)
Am talking head shots, whoever with you was next
Now it's candle lightning, your picture on niggas chest
Picture losing your breath, seeing Lucifer in the flesh
Picture me killing your mom before you laid to rest (picture that)
You out here playing games, they raise me to play for keeps
I still ride through Harlem, less K in the backseat
When I ride through niggas bop, and look like a track meet
Hit caught slipping like Ricky on one a them backstreets
Highing with 'em hits, niggas know what this shit
With the hazards, jump out and give you the whole clip
Go home, change clothes, them come back through your strip
Looking for the rest a them Fa*ts you ran with  (where they at?)
Motherfucker this ain't music, this really how am moving
The game wide open and it's time for me to move in

[Chorus]
Cruising uptown where our God made the pull
Gettin this money, just like paid in full
This feel so good, you heard
Cruising uptown where our God made the pull
Shout out to all Harlem, The whole BX, wad up! Uptown
Gettin this money, just like paid in full
