[Intro: Mac Miller]
In here with the legendary DJ Kay Slay

[Chorus (Partial): Rell]
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuckin' up the premises, I been a dick
Ain't beneficial, I'm 'bout to issue your nemesis
Evacuate the buildin' when I come through
Evaluate your feelin's when I come through
Tire marks and gun smoke stories
OGs reminisce and show glory
She said, "Nigga I'm hopin' you make a way out
Before I make this Mac-11 do it for me"
I know responsibility weighin' down on my shoulders
Summertime always the coldest
Niggas do you dirty like the projects
Twenty-five? Then you are the oldest
This is the feelin' you get when you ride
Till the wheels fall off and there's no mo' drive
I see the fear when I look in your eyes
Should execute or x out and expire

[Chorus: Rell]
Another day (yeah,) different time (yeah)
But the same old story's told
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Champagne liquor, pair of Bape slippers
Blue collar for the dollar, I'm in Pittsburgh
Young Mac with rings, bitch, I'm Derek Fisher
Ballin' super hard, you can smell the swisher
'S no one I met workin' hard as I do
It's like I never even made a fucking dollar
I'm a genius though, you can check my IQ
Y'all lookin' stupid when you pop your fucking collar
Take a breath, make a toast
I seen the Devil tryna take my soul
But he ain't gon' touch what he can't control
This some food for thought, you can get a plate to go
Me and Kendrick on a track, man, that's bad news
For all you rappers who be talkin' shit to act a fool
Givin' bitches a "D" like we was back at school
But that's only if they got that bad attitude

[Chorus: Rell]
Another day (yeah,) different time (yeah)
But the same old story's told
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Kept it street with you has beens, they just entertainers
Yet they're going dumb, they go to buggin' you for favors
Talk behind your back by telling women that they made ya
Scared of the slum, I be in 'em like broken bottles
Go to whippin' throttle, bending corners in the bottom
Did it like he's TIP, pull a click, then recline 'em
Cold summer, swimmin' in the puddle with piranhas
GRR like Eminem bitch I ain't never knew my mama
Changed on the 1st, born father wasn't shit
Sayin' everytime she gaze at me all she see is dis
A nigga on his dick scared to help with the rent (why?)
Said she love me, I don't ever get the nerve to tell her shit
Cryin' on the inside, lookin' through the fence
Looking up to ballers, often time I reminisce
Prayin' to the stars, I go hard with the bricks
Flip 'em 1 to 2, pass 'em the rock, make an assist (score)
Feel like MoneyMakingMitch, pure shooter, I don't miss
Kill 'em bout whatever, bet not ever get it bent
Bitch you say you love to suck another nigga dick kept it real
Get the money, ain't no sense in actin' funny
Did a bid, came home then made her fuck him in front me
Back to back, cold-heart makin' all assumptions
Now we goin' far but you came back from travelin' outta states
While you other bitchesâ€‹ hate back in the country
Record deals saw why I had to fuck with who love me
And this WCW, Love to cheat on her husband
She from Colorado, she die with niggas who thuggin'
While her faker was in prison, two niggas stuffed in the cutty
Ball players runnin' trains on her and her buddies
Picture get depicted you hated me over nothin', motherfucker

[Chorus (Extended): Rell]
Trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand
Another day, different time
But the same old story's told
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand
