[Hook]
You mad ‘cause I'm stylin' on you
You mad ‘cause I'm stylin' on you
Man, you just mad ‘cause I'm stylin' on you
Yeah, you mad ‘cause I'm stylin' on you

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning, wipe all the lint out my hair
Then I prepare what type of fly shit I'ma wear
Hop in the shower, hop out, slip in my gear
My chick on the stairs, walk around, switchin' to rear
I sit on my chair, hand on my chin, and just stare
My vision is clear, they show me love isn't sincere
These niggas is squares, they know I got the illest ideas
Millionaires, I got enough wisdom to share
They snitchin' out here, hip-hop cops friskin' my peers
These niggas in fear, how can I win if I'm in there?
Mousse in my hair like, "Pap, end these niggas career!"
I'm grinnin' like "Yeah," Hell, I'm sendin' em there
As soon as I got the check, I let it flip when it cleared
You a backstab, a snake, a prick in your ear
Somebody need to pray for him, I got him in my prayers
That other nigga 'bout to die, I'm puttin' him in my swears

[Bridge 1]
I got the hammer on my hip
Ice on my wrist
Drive a big whip
And you ain't got shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You's a test tube baby, hit your test tube up
I see they gassed you
Why you let 'em Amoco and Hess you up?
I had the .38 Special tucked
Since Color Me Badd was singing "I Wanna Sex You Up"
The cousin, the brother, the friend, I get you stuck
Even hit the Godfather with a threatful pump
Hit all of your step brothers and the rest you chumps
Don't let your relatives get you slumped
I can't curse on the radio, but I'm 'bout to eff you up
I hit the uncle, the aunt, and the nephew up
You ain't even built like that, but yet you tough
When it go down I bet you duck
I'm sick with it, I'm a full blown cold, I'll mess you up
You just a little sneeze, God bless you, chump
Wet you up, tell 'em vest you up
Whoever told you I don't do my thing in the streets
They set you up

[Bridge 2: Papoose]
I got a album full of hits
Work on the strip
A phone full of chicks
And you ain't got shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I keep my pants saggin', hell of a style, my gear matchin'
I ride the Caddy truck, you ride in a band wagon
The elevator take too long, you can't catch it
Chase you in your building and run up the stairs clappin'
What's the reason niggas be thinkin' it can't happen?
I show and prove, he show-and-tell, your man braggin'
She look right, her jeans so tight she can't fasten
And she popped the zipper squeezin' her bare ass in
Turn my music up real loud, yeah, blast it
My style's so nasty I'll give you a eargasm
Saliva on your face, ‘cause you really don't care
Try to act like you crying, you got spit in your tears
Send your team into crisis, you niggas is scared
I ain't gotta be the one to get rid of this queer
I bet you one of them other niggas kill him this year
And he gonna die like a coward, ‘cause he living in fear

[Bridge 1]
