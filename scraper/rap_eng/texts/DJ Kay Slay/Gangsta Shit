[Intro: OJ Da Juiceman]
Kay Slay I got you baby Juiceman in this mu'fucker! Pimps roll shortly
AYE! DAMN! AYE! OK! DAMN! JUICE!
Awww man what it do cuz? We rockin like cut off stockin fronts
From the A to the N-Y man that's how we do now, check it out

[Verse One: OJ Da Juiceman]
See I pull up in that club then my car say AYE!
And I pull off from that club, with my car like OK!
And I step off in that thang, everybody sayin DAMN!!!!!
Young Ju man yes indeed is the man
Lookin in my trap, and my cookin right hand
And my diamond is recruited with the fate of Uncle Sam
WHAM! BAM! There go instant gram
I do muscle, break it down and then get to the plan
Break so many racks, I can make you a fan
Then pull up in my Hummer sittin on them ceilin fans
Then get it out the hood then make myself some extra then
On a solo mission while I distributin grams
We be GPS make your girl brains scram
Sign barely finest and I'm on a platinum band
Put me in yo' hood and I'll steal all the grams
Young Ju man Thirty two yes I am!!!!!!

[Hook: Yo Gotti] (OJ Da Juiceman) (*Papoose)

(AYE! DAMN! AYE! OK!) (*Papoose, Pa-poose)

[Verse Two: Papoose]
Man I must floss word to me, young boss courtesy
Southern hospitality and Up North courtesy
Japanese, chnky eyes, suck dog certainly
Fish, rice, soy sauce, duck sauce, servin me
Trust your security I'll crush your authority
Son call emergency they rushed off nervously
Run for affirmery, cut it off surgery
Shootin at the top window bust off vertically
Clutch more burners bleed it tucks all burgundy
Bang like the Russians when they dust off Germany
Did it by accident your tough talk irkin me
I did it on purpose man I touched yours purposely
Walk to the whip with the drunk walk swirvin these
Puff, cough, burn the trees, of course burn the cheese
Catch you goin in your crib, tough lost turn the key
Said they wanna murder me, fuck off murder these!!!!

[Hook: Yo Gotti] (*OJ Da Juiceman)

(*AYE! DAMN! AYE! OK!)

[Verse Three: Yo Gotti]
That A to the K! Will slay one of you bitch niggas
How you a D-boy and never seen a brick nigga?!
And I'm with Papoose (Poose!) We on that Grey Goose (Goose!)
Goons on deck (Deck!) Whenever I say shoot (Shoot!)
And I'm a thug nigga (Yeah!) I got love nigga (Yeah!)
In the N-Y but I'm from the south you know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Where the Kush price at? (Ha!) The white a little cheaper (Cheaper)
And I don't want no phone I'm about to cop a beeper (Yeah man!)
This here for all my people hustlin out their on the grind (Grind)
Hey get your money my nigga, you supposed to shine
But my homey just died, I see my people them cryin
You hear that pain in my voice? Your life ain't nothin like mine
I saw them dyin at the line, I told them time after time
I been on grind after grind, it still me clips in my nine
You just a industry nigga, that's why your beef ain't all sowed
But when it's beef in the hood, nigga our life will be gone
I use my pen as my mic, so I can talk through my songs
I'm one of the realest niggas out now correct me if I'm wrong
If you had done what I done, or you did seen what I seen
Then you can understand why I am Yo Gotti the king, Yeah!

[Hook: Yo Gotti] (*OJ Da Juiceman)

(*AYE! DAMN! AYE! OK!)
I'm on that gangsta shit!!!! I'm on that gangsta shit!!!! (Yo!!!! Gotti!!!!)
