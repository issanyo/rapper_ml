[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Men Of Respect, See us comin through you better respect us (BROOKLYN!!!!)
Papoose, Jimmy (HARLEM!!!!) Banks what's good?! (QUEENS!!!!)
It's Yayo nigga!!!! Yeah! YEAH!!!!

[Verse One: Tony Yayo]
I got every pair of Jordans, every kind of bitch
Ridin foreign cars my life is the shit (COME ON!!!!!)
My Louis bookbag, is full of them stacks
Homey I'm in Spain I ain't thinkin about hats
I say Cassius Clay, you say butter, I say Parkay, I drink Rose'
I had swag since the third grade
Havin sex on the beach with a mermaid, draped in that Herme
In that spur, pullin on that purple
Cause I like her, and I like her too
No time to talk bitch get in
My first time in the booth, I knew I would win
The first time in the pen it was different than the streets yo
I seen niggas make movies out of C.O's
Fuck my P.O. he got a attitude
But I'm a man of respect what he 'gon do?

[Hook: Rell]
For everytime I hear a bitch nigga talk
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime I bag a new fly ass broad
That just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime the streets say that I'm that boy
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
I got the tools that keep you niggas in check
To me I'm not a fool I'm a man of respect (YEAHHHHH!!!!!)

[Verse Two: Papoose]
We some men of respect, you a bitch in a dress
I got these niggas so scared that they swimmin in sweat
And they don't send us a check, he gettin hit in his chest
My daughter needs her hair done I gotta get some barretts
Put the grip on the sket, and graze the skin off his neck
I keep a 40 like Queens but I don't live in the 'jects
You ever send us a threat? That you don't live to regret
You better come with your towels even gorillas get wet
Ladies lift up your breast, you bang lift up your set
My gun got a bad bladder take a piss on your vest
THUG-A THUG-A, THUG-A, THUG-A my click is the best
Your bars stink, that's why you got shit on your breath
Niggas clapped tryin to slap me five
I put 'em on wheelchairs, like Drake on Degrassi High
They say I don't smile, that's cause I don't play fair bro
I stay Sirius like satellite radio

[Hook: Rell]
For everytime I hear a bitch nigga talk
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime I bag a new fly ass broad
That just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime the streets say that I'm that boy
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
I got the tools that keep you niggas in check
To me I'm not a fool I'm a man of respect (YEAHHHHH!!!!!)

[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
I'm a South Jamaica Queens nigga (YEAH!)
Boy play me make a scene nigga countin paper clean nigga
Bouncin on that beam nigga, and not that star type
Where I go, moms go, make it rain at the stop light
My Coupe makes the cops tight, my auror make the shorties get her wop right
Drop her off and catch my portal rock flight
Block life, kingpin, respect the center block ice
God it must be somethin good, could be seven hot dice
Locally connected, vocally respected
International record I'll be leavin any second
Check it, let me stretch it 'fore your funds exit
My Method, got your Man Louis V vested
Excellent, my weed man got me somewhere in the clouds
Havin daydreams of me sleepin on a hundred pounds
For any burglary sounds we got a hundred rounds
AK's when I'm down to the ground and put 'em down

[Hook: Rell]
For everytime I hear a bitch nigga talk
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime I bag a new fly ass broad
That just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
And everytime the streets say that I'm that boy
It just makes me wanna get more money (More money)
I got the tools that keep you niggas in check
To me I'm not a fool I'm a man of respect (YEAHHHHH!!!!!)

[Verse Four: Jim Jones]
Now BK stand up (BED-STUY!!!!!!!!!!)

Goons don't play (NO) That'll get ya jammed up
Gotta watch the jakes, that'll get ya canned up
You know how we play, hundred grand a truck (FLOSSIN!!!!)
Them dice games, two grand and up
The life man, the lights and the cameras
Parked the Maserati, right in front of Marcy (YEP!!!)
To talkin with the homeys when I'm out at Marcus Garvey (MELON)
And pardon me y'all, I meant chalkin bodies (GOONIES!!!!)
Shout to Lil' Kim do your bid like Frank White
Then come home and do it BIG like Frank White (BALL ON 'EM!!!)
We buy cars just to race 'em like the Indy's (SPEEDIN!!!!!)
They fly the Spur a buck eighty for the bentley (WOW!!!!!)
A rockstar like the Red Hot Chili Pep's
