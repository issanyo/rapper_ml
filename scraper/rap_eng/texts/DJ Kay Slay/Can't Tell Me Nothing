[Hook: MeetSims]
Youngin' on the block all day, getting money always
Can't tell me nothin'
We didn't never know no way gettin' through the hallway
Can't tell me
Look what you made me
I'm just a product of my environment you see
Can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm rolling in a stolen Rolls Royce
Fuck a rapper, I been listening to my own voice
My name got respect, got a chain, got a check
Going in I'm selling dope like I ain't got no choice
It's really true, I leave the trap and do a walk through
Told my bitch Imma shoot her if she talk too
Red rag, blue rag, what that shit do
I drop a bag just to make sure I get you
I got a mask but I made sure he seen me
Right before the flash he was sayin' take it easy
I know a bunch of real niggas and some hoes with it
I got some homies could get it but they nose in it
Damn

[Hook: MeetSims]
Youngin' on the block all day getting money always
Can't tell me nothin'
We didn't never know no way gettin' through the hallway
Can't tell me
Look what you made me
I'm just a product of my environment you see
Can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Young man money with goals
Getting hoes chasin' bags tho'
Time reveals while hidin' in the hills
This is real, I advise those wake up fast
Get your bread right when terror is cracking
Now its happenin'
From the era of the fly shit, few of us left
Some are locked in the cages blowin' trees with a stretch
It could of been the God making the wrong moves
I hung the wrong crews, Allah saw the cycle now I step
Gettin' back to a better space
Put your brain in a better place
Fuck those lames, stay cheddar chasin'
I'm patient, the thought came from the basement
Yo, clean up, then dream up, move right the cream up

[Hook: MeetSims]
Youngin' on the block all day gettin' money always
Can't tell me nothin'
We didn't never know no way gettin' through the hallway
Can't tell me
Look what you made me
I'm just a product of my environment you see
Can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
These days you gotta change up yo location
Crime state be the mental talk is minimal unless its with the general
Got the heart of a seminole, identical blood
Wait for the drop, just watch me nigga, Chuck's in the mud
My niggas answer to nobody but God himself
And the Holy Spirit, you ain't feel it? come pay me a visit
Just tryna find the pieces to the puzzle
We sitting in traps with Barney Rubble face covered in stubble
Was naked without it, I run through this jungle of brick and struggle
In fact most of my work I'm putting in with my knuckles, nigga
Got no intention of slowing up in this prohibition
You ain't in no position to go against the coalition
Never pressured so I just take a shit on opinions
And keep it flippin' critics could eat a dick I'm tryna make a living
Rock
