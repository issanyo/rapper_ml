[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is soothing but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out your car while it's moving
You been waiting on this moment, my sermon is like a omen
I'm serving, I'm Erick Sermon, I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book, go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage and find something
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumping
I'm constantly copping over you, squatting, shit has gotten
To the point where I ain't even writing no more, I'm just jotting
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickening, I've been kicking ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Canibus?
Then it's Dre's fee, if you Kay Slay, the fees waved
I stay beefing with JD, 'til the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazing him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape and the tape leaked
"Say What You Say," motherfucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, motherfucka
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucka
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker
