Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, GreekFest, the home of Summer Jam
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, A gym star scale a hundred grams
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
The home of America's Most Wanted Man

The crackheads's talkin, load mouths talkin
Hoe, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin
Out in New York

[verse 1: Papoose]

Walked in the store and swallowed some of the Henny
Then I passed to the bottle guzzlers
50 box 50 straight, I was playin my lotto numbers
My money on the counter
Thats when I spotted some of the wild animal essence
They drama lovers, but when the lil homie see Pap they holla Thuga!
Popi try to tell me I ain't pay him, stop it brotha
I grinds for mines. I'm out the gutta
Man I'm comming straight Out in New York
What you think I'm some kinda sucka?
Oh you tryin to hustle me, You think you some kind of hustler
He said I'm not your brotha
I reached my hand over the counter and punched em
You call me a counter puncher
How you gon' let them tell you he press me?
When you know I woulda got at em Quick like Nestle
Any man on God's Earth disrespect me
I bet you I put the beats on like a MP

[Chorus]

Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, GreekFest, the home of Summer Jam
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, A gym star scale a hundred grams
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
The home of America's Most Wanted Man

Firecrackers, Jumpin Jacks, I make ya block look the 4th of July
Skyrockets, Roman Candles, Blockbusters, I turn ya block to the 4th of July
Bust guns like fireworks, Tottin them thangs
Put the 380 in ya mouth and open ya brain
The art of war stakes know the terrain
We use to stuff m80 in payphones and blow out the change
Back when CrissCross had the backwords jeans
I was around with maxium things
Nigga screamin they bringin the town back
They fat, I'm lean
They don't know how with they whack regime
I'ma bring it back borough by borough
Pap supreme, After I bring Brooklyn
I'm commin back for Queens
Speak the facts when rap, my raps is mean
I just give you the facts like a fax machines

[Chorus]

Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, GreekFest, the home of Summer Jam
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
Yeah, A gym star scale a hundred grams
Out in New York, Out Out in New York
The home of America's Most Wanted Man

[verse 3: Papoose]

Paper chase, I never seen money chase niggas
Got focused and money came quicker
I'm a .38 gripper
Write songs but he paint pictures
Open the bottle and let my tummy taste liquor
I don't watch DVDs, I study grey scriptures
I get tired at lookin at all these funny face niggas
They ain't gettin they hair dirty, They too scarey
They hire real niggas to do it, They too leary
I don't let them fools near me, you hear me?
Them cowards will put money on ya head like the tooth fairy
They play dice too much they abuse the grind
Now they bettin work, so they shottin for dimes
Takin they jewls off, now they shottin for shines
After they loose that they wanna use they .9
But not around me, I keep them dudes in line
I tell em loose ya money don't loose ya mind
