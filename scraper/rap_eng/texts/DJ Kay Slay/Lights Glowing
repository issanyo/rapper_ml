[Hook]
Every single block, all these fucking cops
Damn my nigga, they won't leave me alone
Harass a nigga when he walking home
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, glow, glow, glow
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, yea yea yea
All I see is lights glowing

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Weed blowing lights glowing, who the fuck is this?
Gun charge, lawyer money, case got dismissed
Hand on the steering wheel diamonds on my wrist
Back up coming, black cops be the most pissed
Like, damn I ain't sell a drug in some time
Why you acting like that? Don't you niggas know I rhyme?
King pin, (?), he ain't got a dime
Gang unit all they do is fuck with my slime
Nah nigga I ain't gotta steal this car
I'm caked out all I gotta do is write a bar
Price can change honestly depending who you are
We still fam fuck it but I love you from afar
But here come Mr. Officer, finger on the trigger
Nervous as a motherfucker shooting at a nigga
Why I don't feel safe, and I ain't even dirty
Cause cops around here that I know is 730, ahhh

[Hook]
Every single block, all these fucking cops
Damn my nigga, they won't leave me alone
Harass a nigga when he walking home
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, glow, glow, glow
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, yea yea yea
All I see is lights glowing

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Every other block, all I see is fucking cops
And they want a nigga locked, I'm just tryna light this pot
What you jealous of these knots? But I work hard for it
Strive to be a rapper even prayed to God for it
Make a little money throw you in the yard for it
Want a small time so I got large for it
Now you could hit a lick or you could flip a brick
But stay away from rats and the Jake up on the strip
Think you don't give a fuck, but the judge don't give a shit
And that jail time will hurt you and your families on the fritz
Yea I rather play the Ritz, legal money when they blitz
I'm no longer selling raw, I was on the tour with Kiss
I was on the tour with Sheek, six figures in the week
Seven figures in the month, you ain't really got the key
You ain't really got to trip, cause the whip is on fleek
That was young boy talk but got a lawyer I could reach
Ghost

[Hook]
Every single block, all these fucking cops
Damn my nigga, they won't leave me alone
Harass a nigga when he walking home
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, glow, glow, glow
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, yea yea yea
All I see is lights glowing

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Fuck the police coming straight from the under privileged
Niggas in my neighborhood period
Serious, hate for the dark complexion
Piggy who you talking to? I am not a jiggaboo
And this is not the sixties, let 'em come get me
I am not scared of 'em, I am never blared from 'em
Never will still whitey wants to kill all niggas that will not run
Freedoms got a shot gun
Ask Kay Slay, my niggas carry AK's
Automatic rifles, I ain't gotta like you
Tell you what I might do, call to the hood
Tell 'em televise the revolution fuck it this is our hood
Why you targeting my people? Nah we ain't equal
Suppose a nigga stole you to keep you
Underneath the bottom of his feet
Though the father of it all was a black man, fuck y'all

[Hook]
Every single block, all these fucking cops
Damn my nigga, they won't leave me alone
Harass a nigga when he walking home
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, glow, glow, glow
All I see is lights glowing, glowing
Glow, yea yea yea
All I see is lights glowing
