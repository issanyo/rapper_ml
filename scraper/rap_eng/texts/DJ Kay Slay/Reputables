[Verse 2]
My past is sorted and it's all recorded
Been holding cash the IRS couldn't ignored
Been making plays on Broadway, no performing, clapping
No applaud if it didn't go according to the plan
I was the six man scoring, coming off the bench like J.R
Smith with a A.R, spit quick, sound like thunder okay y'all
Make fake thug sing like Tamar
Dad told me no matter how intense the pressure get
A real king won't subject himself to peasant shit
Fuck the retorick, Am a pessimist on a precipice
At the edge of this, seeing the definite, definite
My moves devenish, to the law, I'm a reverent
But to my dogs am benevolent (shooter)
It's indisputable, irrefutable, my position in my gang is reputable

[Chorus]
I only fuck with reputable niggas
If you get out a line, come and step to you haters
Reputable niggas, give me your reputable hitter
I got no time for buss ass niggas

Fuck your link in Bio, just pour a liquor in his cupid
Tell your girl to take my number, I don't think she refuse it (no)
