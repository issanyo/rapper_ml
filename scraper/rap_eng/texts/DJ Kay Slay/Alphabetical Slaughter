[Intro: DJ KaySlay]
Aiyyo it's DJ KaySlay the Drama King
And for those of y'all that don't know
I'm workin with a new artist, he goes by the name of Papoose
And for those of y'all that didn't finish school
Check this out, it's all good
I'mma run y'all through this little Thug-acation right now
And what we gon' do, is we gon' scream out the letters in the alphabet
And every letter you hear screamed out, from A to Z
My man Papoose gon' break it down for you
So what you do, is get your pens, your pads, and take notes
Yo Papoose, let's go!
