[Verse 1: Game]
Nigga pull up, hop out the Cutlass, tell a nigga fuck this
I ain’t toleratin' no fuck shit
Wifey at the halfway house, with a bitch with her ass hanging halfway out
I ain't bout no games nigga, that's my name
Gold grill with a blunt hanging halfway out
Nigga can’t tell me shit
Unless he got hits and then he can tell me how them hash weigh out
Crib laid out like a pimp here, your bitch there on a bed laid out
Nigga talkin that fuck shit, we just spray out
Boy get yo whole motherfucking hood K’d out
I was born in the C.P. Tommy on my lap
If it’s cheese in that ho you can find me in the trap
But when it’s snap, give a fuck about a rap
Yup, Me and Buck back, 7-eleven on the crack
See a car I like, Get the fuck up outta there
Grand Theft Auto on a bitch ass nigga
[?], pull a truck up outta there
Then pop bottles, let me hit that nigga, roll blunts the size of this Mac
I’m in love with the kush, I ain’t givin' that back, trill nigga
Smoke till my lungs collapse, pass out with a fifth of that cognac
Real niggas gone recognize this G shit
Don’t come at me with no peace shit
That peace shit, that was ‘89, I get yo ass hit with 89’s
Motherfucker 'fore the cops get down, nigga J’s coming off
Drive off with the K’s running off
Fly home, tuck my sons into bed, kiss my daughter on the head
And leave a note by her motherfucking bed

[Hook]
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Ain’t shit changed with me nigga
Been around the world with the same AK
Same clip with more bodies on it
Then hook yo hood with this beef shit
Looking around but nobody want it
Niggas know what’s up with Buck
Get a couple murder cases coming up, shoot first
Molly popping; that’s young niggas
All they really wanna do now is do dirt
Moving on and I’m gone, papa got a brand new home
And I’m not looking back, I’m just cooking crack
Until I get back where I belong
My bitch leave brains all on my seat
But these niggas blood all on my hands
Been riding up and down these streets
Fucking as many niggas I can, shotgun shell still in my leg
Got a few racks still on my head
Gotta stay strapped now, they handicapped now
Fuck niggas who’s stealing my bread
Had to buy a graveyard for just trappers
Ain’t got a funeral home for you rappers
Know I can play the role with you actors
When we gone get enough to come after
Now send it nigga, I’m going Kendrick nigga
You can start the shit but Imma end it nigga
If you getting money better spend it nigga
This real life, no pretending nigga
Back at it again, fresh out the pen
Remember back then? They had to let me in
And ya'll niggas talking bout cashing out
I need a trash bag to put the cash in

[Verse 3: Papoose]
