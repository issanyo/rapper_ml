[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Hitman for hire, no escape, chill with all the big plans mcgyver
You diving into quick sand when I will
Lean on you with this heat like a tick stand on fire
Save your hocus pocus no I don’t believe in magic
Boy I believe that this ratchet is filled to the tip with talent
When you disappear, got nothing to do with talent
I wave at your top hat, watch you hop around like a rabbit
Voila, yawda, calabunga with shells, treat you like little splinters
Don’t fuck around with joell
My burrow start with a b, finish up with a end
And I’ll always more be in, every project that I be in
Ask the Spanish housing work cause they’ll tell you see that bien
When I clean up in the morning, who be in the lobby hin
Even in the trap I’m the king of the boom bap
I snap you get the beats, like I’m producing the tracks
Wanna beef on the record, I finish your ass on the wax
Wanna beef off the record, your ass still getting waxed
And I could talk shit, cause your lip will be all split
While your nose is a faucet, and I’m watching it all drip

[Verse 2: Fred The Godson]
In case they wailing, I’ma pop it
Guns is Jason Collins coming out the closet
It’s logic, I’m working on this project
And I got work up in the projects
Yeah, so it’s a pioneer, so I’ma pioneer
Getting stereo types, sony, pioneer
I’m 2 up, I come around flossin
Girls said I blew up, south town boston
They tell rappers fred knives stay away
I spit till I’m taped up, lay away
Infrared stay away
Miami could be playing in New York
Couldn’t make me put the ray away
Life skill, we could battle
… got a light bill on a barrel
I’m involved in mobbin, don’t trust it
Your girl is a bird, I’ll abduct her
The way I handle, I should be playing it …
Look like you need arrest, go and cuff her

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Champagne killers, everything I wear
Niggas bought the same thing killing
Yeah, the movies are more slicker
Lifestyle richer
Rats be in the chair, yellin yeah he’ll hit you up
I’m known to ruin a wake, but still an old ruin to take
You get it, holding mob style me
And sleeping at niemens
Email, send me a seamen
Bitches, can’t stop winning it’s fake
Keep it moving…shoot off, shoot horse, carry my plate
Cause when it’s realer, she weight, gun cock ready to bait
I love em, hug em, get the best of these traits
Rich niggas never get just, that’s why they want him away
When everything’s closer, it’s straight
Back to getting money, back in the bay
Back and I’m slay
