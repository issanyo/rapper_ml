I come through your city
I come through your town
All my niggas with me
We gonna shut it down
I say I come through your city
I come through your town
All my niggas with me
We gonna shut it down
Shut it down, shut it down, bitch, we gonna shut it down
Shut it down, shut it down, bitch, we gonna shut it down
I say I come through your city
I come through your town
All my niggas with me, we gonna shut it down
[Driicky]
I say I come through your city
Feel like Diddy
Caught with Henney
Don’t say fiby
Bad bitch with me, ass poke out, oh, so pretty
I run his house, Joe Joe Diggy
Bands I count, you throw pennies
That’s why your hoe give me faith but I don’t know Biggy
Artists go on my plaque you can tell him while it burst
Now it’s 50 fucking grams just to get a fucking verse
All these crazy bitches want me
Bet that you could smell the worth
All these Jersey doubles rob me but we caught it, hell on earth
Threw the McLaren to drop, got on my Jeremy Scott’s
I know my Rollie look cold but her panties still hot
You and I rocking, we’re drinking, yeah, Iamsu with me
And we don’t fuck around
Whether a town or a city
No matter who with me
Bitch, we gonna shut it down

I need that big boy guap
I’m talking millions, bitch
Got Fight Club in my crib
I got too many kicks
Too many niggas swagger jacking
They paste and copy
I’m spending Franklins
My shades Versace
I got a lot of haters watching
Tell ‘em don’t watch me, watch TV
We be sleepy, off that tree tree
Got a piece by but, no teepee
All black everything, clothes and shoes
Stevie when you see me, bitch
Two tone Rollie, two chains on me
Everyday I’m district, bitch
Cruising up the river like some great
Me and Driicky we some niggas getting paid
Gang bang, hot breakers in this thing
Watering down but I’m still on fire
Your girl get low while we get higher
[Hook]
