Girl I need somebody
Who will stand by my side;
Always ride with me
Through the good times and the bad times...
When I was down, you were down. You and I
Now we up, we up
Oh, and i'ma lay it down
We up, we up
Girl i'ma keep you on the ground
We up, we up
Look at where we at now
F--- what anybody say
You will always be around
