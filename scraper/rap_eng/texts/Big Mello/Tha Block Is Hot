{Intro}
I ain't know we were starting
Woo

{Verse 1: Mighty Bay }
Stright off the streets of APT
Nuts in my hand trusting no man
The block is hot but I stay inside cause I didn't want a tan
You'll understand once these lyrics comprehend
To you and not Your guardian
For the kids for the kids For the look

{Verse 2: Big Mello}
I'm trying to stay on feet now, hustling in these streets now
Got to feed my family, if I don't work we don't eat
No time for all that capping, showing off and acting
Brothers with that flashing, just don't know what's happening
Now it ain't what you do it's how you do, keep your business on the cool
Stack that paper the golden rule, don't let no one stop you

{Outro: Mighty Bay}
Yeah
