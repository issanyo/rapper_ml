(*talking*)
What uh, Southside for li'
What, H-Town baby come on

[Big Mello]
Watch me come through, tal'n bout what it do
Hop out who-do, trunk knock with that Screw
Ain't nothing changed, see I'm still true blue
Hit my licks, but I keep em on the cool huh
I'm a damn fool huh, KMJ the crew
Already heavy like a Cheve, bout the feddy
On scrill break limits, shred rappers like confeddi
Grip the damn grain, pinky ring keep it steady
I'm the body rocker, represent the Southside
Even when I'm high, keep that money on my mind
So I grind, T on my side we gotta shine
Hoes gon mind, cause they know the ice blind
All the time, see I gotta wreck
Cash a damn check, keep my shit up in your deck
The architect designer, hustler slash rhymer
Candy paint niggas, I'm the base like primer
What big timer, Big Mello
Big thang nigga, stack big pesos
Me and Z-Ro, J and Geno
On the Q track, keep the flow so thoed
I'ma body rock ya, from your head to your toe
Boys can't see, Mello and Z-Ro
Only at the show, late night video
Hiram-Clarke/Mo City, what Mafioso

[Z-Ro]
Ridgemont 4 representer, niggas wonder where I went
Bending corners in a Intrepid, fo' do' behind tint
Making stacks upon stacks upon stacks, of B. Franklin
Anybody running up on KMJ, will be stanking
I might be shermed out, I might be smoking on that drizzo
Anyway it go, I'm still gon put a tag on your big toe
Ask Eugene, we killers with automatic machine
Knocking over walls when we crawl, keeping our mug on mean
If you got a sensitive side, get up out my ride
Cause it's sho to be some pistol play, probably homicide
If you's a snitch nigga bitch nigga, I'm digging your ditch
Giving out dome calls, leaving everybody wigless
I'm gonna, give a nigga a headstone
Cause I'm after my paper, mama say go get it even though she dead and gone
Smoke and dranking with alphabets, to tighten my lip
With a dirty gar beam for busters, hitting em right in they hip
I'm a guerilla, do anything it take to make scrilla
Even if one of my own gotta fall, fuck y'all niggas
I'm one of a kind, and ain't no bitch got my mind
I don't need a relationship, as long as I got my nine

[Trae]
Tell me the truth, why do these cats be thinking that they could be fucking with us
Really though I don't know, but they don't wanna be running with us
I'm out that Southsi' for li', for li' until I die
KMJ coming up out of the storm, for real that ain't no lie
With Dougie D and Z-Ro, we making a pay to break bread
If somebody fucking with Big Mello, my slug hit em in they head
Ain't no disrespecting my team, or my team'll get aggravated
All you mark ass motherfuckers better duck, or you infiltrated

[Ghetto]
See I'm a Dirty South talker, philly blunt sparker
Telling hoes to come on down, like Bob Barker
Never been a stalker, man fuck a bitch
All a bitch can do for a pimp, is make me rich
Hit the switch in a mothership, with bump in the trunk
I ain't tripping on no haters, I got that pump in the trunk
And I'm ready to dump, up on a bitch ass nigga
Cause ain't no Blood'n or Crip'n, cause we from Texas nigga
Shit we all about, our cash flow
Don't play no games, or you'll end up with a tag up on your big toe
It's that nigga Mello, and that nigga Ghetto
Coming through your backdo', bitch what they hitting fo'
Some playas, down here
Don't bring your girl, cause we hot pussy slayers down here
Done hooked up with my nigga Daz Dili', from the motherfucking West
Burning holes in you niggas chest, like you was smoking on some stress
Or that bomb-bomb, nigga from Vietnam
Nigga ring the motherfucking alarm, cause it's on
I got my nigga JJ, in a zone
Nigga motherfucker, tell that bitch to bring it on
I don't know why, niggas wanna try but try
But the only think I know, that your niggas'll die
If they fucking, with the KMJ click
If you don't like it, get up off the Southside dick bitch

[Cl'Che]
If you wonder where I'm at, this guerilla at
I'm shining in your face, if you haven't seen me yet
I'm a Southsi' for li', hot girl
Rocking with the Big Mello, and the Crooked Z-Ro
Quick to break the hoes, off
While we dropping tops, we got you dropping your mouth
Cl'Che representing for the South, the Dirty South
Ask that Q, these haters put em in line
Big Mello above the Cl', Z-Ro on the side of Cl'
So I'm telling you, ain't none of that getting close to Cl'
I play with big boys, that move them big thangs
C.D.'s and LP's, so we can get a bigger name
KMJ, we gon stick to your brain like cement
Glass get em Monroe, we flyer than bird shit
It's me, now tell me what you see
A list mouth motherfucker, with a cold mouthpiece
R.I.P. to my G's and chicks, we still swanging them do's
Candy riding on 4's, and niggas polishing they golds
Down here, Southsi' for li'
Houston Texas, just to make it all clear
