(Big mello):
Hip-hopping, dropping
Tops are poppin
Glocks where niggas slanging rocks
Up and down the block it don't stop
Bitches bopping white folks are plotting
Thinking every niggas rotting cause we ain't picking cotton
No more young niggas packing fo fo's
Running from the po po sing like an everyday show
When i grab the remote i gets locced
Because it seems like we lost our hope
Ohh cause the dope got a nigga hanging from a rope can't cope and that ain't no fucking joke
R&B helps me to keep my mind free sucka free smoking sweets and watching tv
In a burban swerving serving these hoes
Coming down on glass 84's
Hands on strap watching for the jack cause a nigga with a gat dont know how to act a fact
We all trapped in the concrete summer heat dopefeins are real good to me
Cause i done put in work doing dirt while these busta ass niggas wearing skirts
And my heart hurts cause it seems that my family is out to get me huh
Now that my face is on tv, remeber yall said i wasn't gonna be shit but uh look at me know im straight legit

(chorus):
Brothers and sisters just hold on tight
Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Dont worry about the one who's hating you
Sit back relax and have a drank or two

(Big Mello):
1995 stepped to the side
Took time to analyze
Niggas acting ?????
Cause everything (good and grin) ain't your friend roaching ass niggas all out to get my ends
Everything was cool and mello gone treat and ughh
Drink about a pint blow big sweets
But when they sweets was gone niggas took they ass home
When u rich you got friends but when your poor your alone
Ain't it funny how the money can change your life all these bopping ass bitches want to be a nigga wife
Ughh and Now im on feet im on state one deep yall can have that limelight ?????
Sucka free
No more tricks in 96 gotta hit a licka flip
Stack chips keep my hand on my pistol grip
Legitimate yea thats the way i flip can't quit to true for that hoe shit that niggas spit
True playa not hata but a paper maker
Innovata originator motherfucken fakers
I keep it real like the gold on my grill
No flex im all chill trying to stack a mill

(Big Mello):
So many Promises promises but all i get are broken dreams
Niggas treat me like a dope fein
Don't get it twisted
I peace that shit
Yall can keep that shit and i don't sweat that material shit
Im going platinum anyway fuck what you niggas say hey im flipping rhymes every mother fucken day
And they hate what i do cause im to motherfucken true i keep it on the cool as a golden rule
It don't cost a dime to stay out of mine partna im a nigga known for bringing the drama and many wonder why a nigga get so agg(ravated) im doing bad so im going for bad now who mad go ahead and laugh
Skinny grin i come again and unleash that demon from within
Yo contaminated soul jealous hearted bustas gotta go
When big mello hit the motherfucken door no more will cry cause nigga do or die that's why i stay high in this life of crime cause as long as im rapping ???? tell what happenin while these other motherfuckers steady capping
