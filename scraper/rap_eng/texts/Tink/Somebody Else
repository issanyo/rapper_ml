[Intro]
Woah oh, whoa oh (yeah, yeah, yeaah)
Woah oh, woah oh
Woah oh, woah ohhh
Woah oh, woah oh

[Chorus]
Nigga gon' be a nigga, that's alright with me
Them hoes calling yo phone, I'ma let it ring
Cause I don't give a damn bout' them other girls
You ain't the only one with somebody else
You can keep doing you, I'ma be doing me
You ain't the only one with somebody else
You can keep doing you, I'ma be doing me
You ain't the only one with somebody else

[Verse 1]
We're even, temporary season
We do good for a week, we fall off and never speak again
Unless I call yo phone up on some random shit
You upset, don't worry put'cha ya girl on instagram
Crazy how we pick and choose, tables turn
Then we loose, then we fight
Then we make up through the night
Yappin' over twitter, please don't front yo move
Cause everything you say I'm doin', you doin' it too (yeah)
I ain't got no problem, problems with it
And yes I'll admit that
I can't get mad at times, but when you on my mind
You thinkin' bout these hoes, cause you know they come and go like that
Guess relationships, they not for me
I don't trust your ass when you in them streets
Ain't no tellin' what'cha doin', so instead of cryin'
I'ma call up my new one (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now it's silent, please don't hide it
If you care, you can let me know
Although I have heard this before, it will make me feel good (good)
We living in a moment every time we lock eyes
I got you wide open, you don't even have to lie
I see it, you wanna make things right but-
Every other night, it's a new girl in yo ride (ay)
Baby I'm not trippin', it's all good
You be out here doin' you, like I knew you would
So I'm out here doin' me, I bounce back with like three
You'll hit me up later askin' "where you been Tink?"
And I'm gon' tell you the truth, I'ma tell you like it is
See you got yours, and I got mine
You wanna know how I been? Boy I been just fine

[Chorus]
