[Intro]
Ohhh
(On to the next one)
Ohhh
(On to the next one)
Woah oh
(On to the next one)
Oh, oh
How can you love me?
You never touch me
Giving me signs
Make up your mind
(On to the next one)
'Cause I know, I know

[Verse 1]
I waited all of these years
You gave me nothing but tears
I was so into your heart
So many secrets you kept in the dark
Say that you want me but that was the twist
Got what you wanted and then you just dipped
That's how you coming and let me know something so I won't be out here assuming you sleep
Leading me on, three in the morning and I don't know where you are
Boy I can merch it, I’d rather be single
Look at your snap and I know that you mingle
But all of these hoes, got you alone, and now all I’m hearing is crickets
I know how this goes, can I get a yes or a no?

[Chorus]
Why is it so easy for you to move on?
(On to the next one)
One day you with me and one day you're gone
(On to the next one)
You was my nigga and I was your chick
Now you just actin' like I don't exist baby

[Verse 2]
Gave you the key but it wasn't enough
I wish I knew who you were from the jump
You gon regret it the day that I'm out, out, oh
Tink got a whole lotta shit on her mind
Been down this road so many times
Why do you play so many games?
(Play so many games)
I'm tryna fight through this pain
I used to fuck with you on so many levels, yo mama, yo sister, they all know the facts
You shut me out when I needed you close and you gon' be upset When I finally snap
Nobody know what I go through alone
I ain't that easy to pull on and press
Gotta be picky wit who lay up with me
'Cause niggas'll hit it and move to the next one

[Chorus]
Why is it so easy for you to move on?
(On to the next one)
One day you with me the next day you're gone
(On to the next one)
You was my nigga and I was your chick
Now you just actin' like I don't exist baby
