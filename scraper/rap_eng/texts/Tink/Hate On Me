[Chorus: Tink]
All I wanna know is why y'all fake with me (they fake)
Show love in the club
Turn around go back and hate on me (fuck em)
I'm just getting money while I'm still alive
You bitches mad at me and I don't know why
(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Tink]
Heard about the rumors
I'ma trend the topic
Said my tape wouldn't do numbers
But be first to cop it
You be that second option
I'm the one they routing for
Told them I would change the game
You bitches ain't been keeping score
Niggas ain't been loyal though
Turned on me with no remorse
Sneak dissing, hoping I choke
Secretly hoping I won't
Make it, I take it
You niggas intimidated
They say my bars overrated
Who gives a fuck, I'm just saying
Bitches want what I'm getting
Counting blessings while sending
Smoking dope with ya nigga
He on my back like some lenan
In the trap, tryna get it
I respect those who grind
They gon' hate me for winning
But show me love and do time
True

[Chorus]
(repeat 2)

[Verse 2: Seven]
You say my ham
You niggas ain't friends
You niggas ain't real
You niggas be fake
Fuck out my face
Like your bitch lace
Tryna knock my deal
Tryna knock my shine
Tryna knock my hustle
Tryna knock my bag
Tryna knock my grind
Tryna knock my duffel, yeah
Shout out to them real niggas
Ones you know that will deal withchu
Ones you know don' been for you
Send you letters and still miss you
That's them guys I'ma grind with
That's them guys I'ma shine with
That's them guys that a kill for you
That's them niggas I'ma die with
All I wanna know, all I wanna know
Why you bitches hate on me
Shawty wanna go, shawty wanna go
Nah, she can't stay with me
She the one that hate the most
Then turned around and favor me
Shawty I'm the famous Seven
Baby you can't even speak
Let's get it

[Chorus]
(repeat 2)
