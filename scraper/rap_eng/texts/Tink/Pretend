[Pre Hook]
Where you at, who you with
Where you going, whatchu doing
What's her name, do I know her
Oh my god, what the fuck
Please lighten up, can we talk
Can we chill, what's the deal

[Hook]
I don't wanna talk about that now
Praying that it doesn't make you act out
Why we gotta fight every weekend
All we gotta do is just pretend

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me why you spaz out
I don't even do that anymore I put my head down
No I'm not the same nigga
You not the same either I don't know how to act now
I wish we could go back
To the day I drop the ball yeah just hold that
Everything is gone now
I had love didn't know how to show that

Baby I ain't nothing like the last guy
You have every reason to ask why
People make mistakes though it happens
I'm not trynna do it on a average
Hoping I can stay with who I came with
Everyday's the same I never changed it
Girl I really pray that I can save this
Always asking me the same shit like

[Pre Hook]
Where you at, who you with
Where you going, whatchu doing
What's her name, do I know her
Oh my god, what the fuck
Please lighten up, can we talk
Can we chill, what's the deal

[Hook]
I don't wanna talk about that now
Praying that it doesn't make you act out
Why we gotta fight every weekend
All we gotta do is just pretend

[Verse 2]
I know you like to feel free
The only time you being yourself is when you with me
All them niggas left you
I should of called more, all I did was text you
I wish I could show you
I'm the only one who really got to know you
You just wanna feel loved
But that's a habit that you gotta get rid of

Cause baby I am nothing like the last guy
I'm not understanding when you ask why
Really wanna try and make it happen
When you say you love me are you acting
Hoping I can stay with who I came with
Do we really have to do this blame shit
Girl I really wish that I can save this
But you always asking me the same shit like

[Pre Hook]
Where you at, who you with
Where you going, whatchu doing
What's her name, do I know her
Oh my god, what the fuck
Please lighten up, can we talk
Can we chill, what's the deal

[Hook 2]
We don't have to talk about it right now
I just wanna fuck and cut the lights out
I wish I was someone you believed in
Even if you do have to pretend
