[Verse 1]
J-J-Jupiter
This feels better than I expected
Never thought I’d be pressing
Upon you for one more
You deserve it I’m bad at aura
Just la love I’ve trophied ring
This feels better than I expected
He says yes baby tonight i learned my lesson
This is pain now that's my spot
This is loud as hell with the doors locked

[Chorus]
This feels this feels this feels
J-J-Jupiter
Ayea ayeaye
This feels this feels this feels
J-J-Jupiter

[Verse 2]
Feel it in my toes I’m not letting go
Scratch yo back up so you know
How it feels
Put it down turn around
That's what you like
Take me to the moon do me till its noon
This is freakier than prince feel it in my legs
And my chest and my neck
What a mess we made here
We’re going to have to get creative
That's when it will be the greatest
Cause we ain't coming down
So high up we in the clouds smoking on tree
While you stroking on me

[Chorus]
This feels this feels this feels
J-J-Jupiter
Ayea ayeaye
This feels this feels this feels
J-J-Jupiter

[Bridge]
Baby my body’s getting cold
Please don't leave me here alone
Baby my body’s getting cold
Please don't leave me here alone

[Chorus]
This feels this feels this feels
Ayea ayeaye
This feels this feels this feels
