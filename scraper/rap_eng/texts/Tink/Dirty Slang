[Hook]
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
I wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you

[Verse 1: Tink]
Touchdown in your city and the girls be with me
I like your waves, can I put my hands on you
Love the way you shinnin, you talk slow but I like it
You keep it up, baby, here’s what I’m gonna do do do do

[Pre-Hook]
Call you up, drop a deuce, have you leaning
Hit the club, throw some ones for the hoes
It's my fault, I just love the way you keep it
Man everybody knows

[Hook]
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
I wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
Wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you

[Verse 2: Rockie Diamonds]
Look, she say she want a young nigga
Yeah, foreign shit for my bottom bitch
Cause my bag right, damn she pour the four
We still leaning from last night
Look fuck losing my … jeans
We dont never play hard games
This shit real for her, its a drip
Paid a girl from Chiraq, back shots thats my cat
And she my dog, my nigga, won’t post them fuck pictures
Tink, just know that I fuck with you
Won't call O-M dawg
On me its all up, yuh

[Hook]
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
I wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
Wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you

[Bridge]
Something bout the way you run these streets
You’re well respected, whole club knows your name
And, something bout the way you talk to me
I hear your accent, makes me go insane

[Hook]
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
I wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you
Ain’t nothing like a country boy, dirty slang
Wanna take you home, teach you some things
Don’t want no pretty guy, that ain’t my type
I want a downtown boy like you

[Bridge]
Call you up, drop a deuce, have you leaning
Hit the club, throw some ones for the hoes
Smile for, I just love the way you keep it
Man everybody knows
Call you up, drop a deuce, have you leaning
Hit the club, throw some ones for the hoes
Smile for, I just love the way you keep it
Man everybody knows
