[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Somewhere in the world a boy or girl is being buried by their mother
Somewhere in the world there is violence, brother against brother
Do your dance, get in your zone, they can't take you out that
Do your dance, get in your zone, they can't take you out that
Every hood, every block, somebody's dying over nothing
All this hating gotta stop, you gotta know life is worth something

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
So do your dance, get in your zone
Nah they can't take you out that
Just do your dance, get in your zone
No they can't take you out that

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
You got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
You got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey

[Post-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone

[Verse 2: Tink]
Kids is dying in front of their house
They giving up life, ain't no hope for them making it out
They 15 buying a two
Just to feel more safe when they gotta make it home from school
Cause you know how the innocent die
Our sons need love every week, it's a funeral line
And bitches wanna party in peace
Get the east, to the west, to the south side moving their feet
Right now moving their feet
Right now moving their feet
Get the east, to the west, to the south side moving their feet
Right now moving in peace
Right now moving in peace
Get the east, to the west, to the south side moving in peace

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Do your dance, get in your zone
Nah they can't take you out that
Just do your dance, get in your zone
No they can't take you out that

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
You got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
You got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey

[Post-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Do your dance, get in your

Do your dance, get in your
Do your dance, get in your
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone
Do your dance, get in your zone

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
But you got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down
From Chicago to L.A
Houston, Miami
All the way to St. Tropez
There's gotta be a better way
But you got to, you got to, you got to
You got to, you got to
Put the guns down, put the guns down
