[Hook]
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down

[Verse 1]
If I fell on my knees, lost everything that I own
Could I rely on you to come through when I called your phone
See plenty people left when they told me they'd stayed forever
That's why I'm not convinced when you tell me that we're together
You could be in my life because I'm famous and on my feet
Would you like me if I was working at CVS up the street
With a nine to five every night and two baby's one month apart
Would I still have your support if I never sold on these charts
That's hypothetical, I love you like my edibles
You hate when I get high, but I'm just feelin' low inside
I've been paranoid, it's colder than North Dakota
Would they still think I'm hot if I drove in this blue Toyota?
I guess you're bottled up so I'm sipping slow while I'm steering
Can't fuck nobody new till I fuck with 'em for they spirit
I need someone who can hold me up until the end
If shit gets real heavy just help me through thick and thin

[Hook]
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down

[Verse 2]
Plane ride, thinkin' 'bout the places I've been
I need a week away from life to fix the mess that I'm in
Pour up a shot and toss it out for all the people I've lost
I had some energies around me that I had to shake off
Good vibes mean everything to a boss
I went from Nike to Chanel and you don't know what that cost
I had to sacrifice a lot
It's real lonely at the top
How deep is our connection?
You good with imperfections
Would you speak if you blew up and you saw me in your section?
Are you here for the fame?
Are you here for the night?
I wanna buy in but you change every time
I know nothing is guaranteed
I contemplate when you tell me you'll never leave
It's just way outta control
I wanna settle down, but first I gotta know

[Hook]
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
