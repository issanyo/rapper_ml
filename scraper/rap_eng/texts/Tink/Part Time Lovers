[Intro]
Where you at?
Mmm, okay, I'm just here, home, alone, missing you
You know I wouldn't lie to you, I wanna see you

[Verse 1]
He got a girl and I got a man
When he ain’t around, I’m sneaking him in
I know that I’m wrong, for leading them on and bringing them home
Back up my man, I’m hittin’ his line ‘cause I wanna meet up again
We keepin’ it quiet, pull up the ride, park in the back of the crib
Under the sheets, nobody know what we do in the dark
This ain’t an audition but I wouldn’t mind playing the part
She had a lunch
Get on the phone and give me a time
Come to the crib, you know what it is

[Chorus]
You need ain’t need much
Part time love
Ooh it feels nice
Part time love
But we not official
Part time love
I wanna be with ya
Part time love

[Outro]
I don't know girl, it's just weird at this point
I mean I love him and all but he constantly, pushes me away
And I know for a fact he fuckin' with other bitches
It's obvious, we don't cuddle, we barely text
And you know his sorry ass don't be takin' me nowhere, and it's like
I know who I am, I know what I deserve, I got my needs to
Shit sometimes I just wanna get away from the nigga, you know?
Fuck somebody new
