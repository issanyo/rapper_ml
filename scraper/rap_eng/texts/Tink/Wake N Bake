[Intro]
Baby, baby
He smoking on that molly
So, I wanna do something real nice
But don't you tell nobody, boy
6 am, can't make no noise

[Hook]
La, la, la, la, la
It's the wake and bake
La, la, la, la, la
Is you with it babe?
In the morning we can get another session

[Outro]
I don't want to O.D., O.D., O.D.,
With molly, molly, molly
You got that shit
Light it up, light it up, light it up
Light it up in the morning
