[Hook: Tink & G Herbo]
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Baby I'm thuggin', I can't be your boyfriend
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Maybe I could be but I don't know if I should be
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
I can't be yours baby, know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Just keep that on the low, baby you know how it go

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Got a gang of bitches
Stress theyselves out tryna be my favorite bitches
Bitches that won't let go when I used to fuck on basic bitches
But you, I fuck with you, 'cause I get you, you like my clue
I don't judge you but don't try me
If I'm wit' you that's 'cause I choose
Anyway I'ma keep it 100, I like the way you penetrate
With that said, I love it but you gon' manipulate
And just take that anyway
Every time you ask me what we gon' be I just grin and say
"Even if we fall off I don't wanna let that take my friend away"
I'm honest, I ain't gon' lie to your face
And you 'posed to appreciate it
Otherwise go 'round the way and let them suckers grease ya baby
Gas ya, ride 'til you on E and go right past ya
Now you stuck on still until them junkyard dummies smash ya
I ain't gon' lie, I see a good girl
Sometimes when I look in your eyes
Most times I just see through your ways
Your ways lead me straight to your thighs
Plus I don't know what's on your mind
Always need your friends to cosign
Never asked for you to be mine
Being yours, I don't have no time

[Hook: Tink & G Herbo]
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Baby I'm thuggin', I can't be your boyfriend
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Maybe I could be but I don't know if I should be
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
I can't be yours baby, know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Just keep that on the low, baby you know how it go

[Verse 2: Tink]
You got me fucked up if you think I'ma be chasin' these niggas
I'm thrown off when I'm next to you and I'm trying things that I never do
Your money long but your head gone
All my friends telling me don't
Problem is you're a street nigga and you're always sending me off
Truly you are my best friend
I fell in love and I can't pretend
Vibe right so don't fall back
If we go together, just call it that
See I show you off 'cause I ain't ashamed of you
I'm just sick of playing all these guessing games with you
Tatted on me, we skin deep, and I ride with him, no DMV
Test drive it, it's all yours, I miss you there when you on tour
Understand you a boss man, you busy getting your hustle on
But every nigga got one bitch that he call on when he feel alone
Bottom bitch, your main thing
Your best drug, your worst pain
Your girlfriend, your confidant
These niggas actin' so nonchalant
But I know you need this, it ain't no secret
Yes I'm the loyal type, I'm just tryna make you mine

[Hook: Tink & G Herbo]
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Baby I'm thuggin', I can't be your boyfriend
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Maybe I could be but I don't know if I should be
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
I can't be yours baby, know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Just keep that on the low, baby you know how it go
