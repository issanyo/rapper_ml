[Hook]
Talk to me, lay with me
Want you to know that you’re breakin’ me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down
Baby you, takin’ me
Why would you think of replacing me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Everything I did, I did it for me and you
The only thing I wanted was loyalty and the truth
But everything you said was part of another lie
The way you did me wrong is something you can’t deny
When you cheated on us, man that hurt me the most
I’m like how you gone betray me for this bum ass hoe
I’m the reason that you even got your life on track
Where am I supposed to run now
I can’t do this on my own
Peep the way you whisper on the line
Change your password like you got something to hide
Whatever’s going on got you acting outta character
Fuck around, make me have to pull up and embarrass ya
Never thought you’d be the one to double-cross me
Never thought that you would have me out here lookin’ salty
I should’ve played you
Thought you was an angel
Put me through this hell after everything I gave you

[Hook]
Talk to me, lay with me
Want you to know that you’re breakin’ me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down
Baby you, takin’ me
Why would you think of replacing me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Look, it’s a shame, I don’t know if I should kill or expose him
These niggas trash from the young to the old ones
I’ma be in jail with a bail by the mornin’
I don’t feel bad cuz I gave you a warnin’
Fuck that, shit, I gave you a pass
Know he was a lame with his regular ass
Should’ve never picked it up when you threw me that attention
How you so in love when you really got a mistress
Clown ass, you a dog and a liar
Come and get your clothes before I set ‘em on fire
What I gotta do just for you to appreciate me
Every time we talk, your excuse starts changing
These hoes, they could never be a factor
Tell him it’s a wrap since he wanna be an actor
He be tellin’ me to chill and be patient
How we gone survive if it’s no communication

[Hook]
Talk to me, lay with me
Want you to know that you’re breakin’ me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down
Baby you, takin’ me
Why would you think of replacing me
Breakin’ me down, down, down, down
