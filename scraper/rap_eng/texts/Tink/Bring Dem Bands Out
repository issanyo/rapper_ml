[Intro: Tink]
My life is a movie
(bring dem, bring dem bands out)

[Hook: Tink]
My life is a movie
This rap shit is a hobby
I'm fucked up in this club
And if you with me, you somebody
I'm a cool ass chick
But I ain't got no time to talk
If these niggas getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out

[Chorus: Tink]
Bring dem, bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out (go)
Bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out

[Verse 1: Tink]
Okay, if molly say I'm popping
Then I guess I'm really famous
I heard Mary's getting jealous
Let her burn like Usher Raymond
No confessions, but I'm cocky
Flow so cold, we can play hockey
Got this boxer on my wrist
Cause evidently bitch I'm Rocky
I dumbed it down for the stupid chicks
Tell her wrap it up, first aid kit
If you hit my line, don't be surprised
If I'm on the move, like a road trip
Are we there yet?
Cause I'm so inpatient
All my niggas got an occupation
And if they don't, I put them on the stove
And if you get me hot, then I'ma let em taste it
Stad down, fingers up
Swisher loaded, rental truck
Fat pack, no lunch sack
But I'm eating good, I should have been a chef
My hats off to my bitch Lucci
My best friend, life introduced me
Move boo, look what money do
We don't hit the club without a camera crew
Cause we

[Hook: Tink]

[Chorus: Tink]
Bring dem, bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out (go)
Bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out

[Verse 2: Lucci Vee]
Okay it's Lucci Vee
I'm checking in
Wanna verse with me
Better break a band
Make a lotta dough
I'm the baking man
But no patty cake, talking Benjamin
Shout out to Tink, she a G fo' show
Keep the beat up, that's nice and flow
And my pussy real sweet, like a Popsicle
So my nigga eat it up like Pappadeaux
I'm balling bitch, Superbowl
Short hair busser, Ocho
Look up to me
I'm a god to hoes
Cause I'm stacking bread, got a mean loaf
That's all me, no drinks
Straight flexin' on em', ballet
And I get a lot of cheese, like souffle
Plus the money rolling in, by the bouquet
See me coming, move out my way
Ya'll want beef, she better grab a steak
With these clown hoes, I will not play
Cause I'll hit it first, like Ray J
So don't fuck with me, cause you know I'm worth it
Top me off, just like I earned it
It's Lucci Vee and Tink G
Bring dem bands out, you wanna fuck with me

[Hook: Tink]

[Chorus: Tink]
Bring dem, bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out (go)
Bring dem bands out (my life is a movie)
Bring dem, bring dem bands out
If you really getting money
Tell em' bring dem bands out
