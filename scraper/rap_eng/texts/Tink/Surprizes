Do you like surprises?
Cause everything that I try with you is all brand new
And I'm hoping that you like it
I'm hoping that you like it
Do you-Do you like surprises

And I'm hoping that you like it

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want and how you want it done
Well I'm gonna ride your body 'till I make you cum
I won't tell no lies, all honesty
Boy you can read my mind like a novelty
Flip me over like a page
Made me holler at your name, yeah yeah
We just finally caught our vibe
Couldn't be a better time, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can explain how it feels
Tonight Imma keep him my heels
Feels like a perfect match
Ridin' on you like a foreign
Put it on you till you snoring
Yeah I got something for you
When we together it got escalated into a hurry
Don’t tell nobody what I did for you up on your birthday

[Verse 2]
You turn me up when we met I was shy
Now when we link it's one hell of a time
Swimming so deep I could drown
Scratching you up while you nailing me down
Feels so nice when you do it with ice and we’re going all full speed
Oh yeah, pullin' on your sheets when you grippin' on my weave
It all started off with some fun sex
Now we're recording
5:45, we're waking up to it in the morning
Kissing on your neck then your roll on top
Thunder rain down when you hittin' my spot
Thunder rain down when you hittin' my spot
Baby I'm a hunnid' you can tell me if you're satisfied
I wanna be around when you want some more
How you gon' feel when you get this show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
