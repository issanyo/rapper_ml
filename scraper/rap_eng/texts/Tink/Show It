[Hook]
Let's go live, what's to hide
If it's real, when we chill
I should know it, know it, know it (Know it, know it, know it)
What's the point in calling me your main bitch, when you can't even show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)
I need a little more proof from you
Your sides gotten way too quiet
Actions speak louder
Show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)

[Verse 1]
Can't understand these niggas like they foreign
Why make me cry from the morning to the night
When we could be fucking
Ooh, it breaks me down when we're not on good terms my love
I want this to work so bad, that it hurts me
Cause I know you don't deserve me
But I'd be a fool, to ever leave (To ever leave)
You're all I got
It's all that I need

[Hook]
Let's go live, what's to hide
If it's real, when we chill
I should know it, know it, know it (Know it, know it, know it)
What's the point in calling me your main bitch, when you can't even show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)
I need a little more proof from you
Your sides gotten way too quiet
Actions speak louder
Show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you but there's no answer when I call
We're going through a faze, I don't recognize your face anymore
You hate it when I cried but you never asked me why
Why does everything revolve around you?
It's killing me inside, who's fucking you at night
Yelling on the phone, cause I'm cold and I need someone to hold
Let me see you with my own two eyes (Show the world babe, show the world babe)

[Hook]
Let's go live, what's to hide
If it's real, when we chill
I should know it, know it, know it (Know it, know it, know it)
What's the point in calling me your main bitch, when you can't even show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)
I need a little more proof from you
Your sides gotten way too quiet
Actions speak louder
Show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)
