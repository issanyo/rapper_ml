[Hook: Jacquees]
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
If he finds out, if he finds out
(Fuck that nigga, ay, ay)
I don't give a fuck, no, yeah
I don't give a fuck, ay, ay
If he finds out, if he finds out

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Tell that fuck nigga, "get lost"
Don't you wanna fuck with a real boss?
Catch a flight, we could dip off
When I pulled up, he was pissed off
And I don't mean to get too explicit
But shorty know I get the juices drippin'
I don't really care if dude hit it
She say, "he ain't hittin' it like you hittin' it"
He broke your heart, I'mma fix that
I'mma go down, I'mma lick that
Your ex-man wasn't with that
I'mma try to make you forget that
That nigga was a fool
Didn't know what to do
Girl, you need somethin' new
I'm tryna fuck with you
I put it down, mini-skirt
I just pull it down, I'm out front
If you don't want him to find out
I just pull around
Who gives a fuck if he find out?
Boy put that nigga in timeout
As a matter of fact, go and tell that nigga you mine now
I don't give a fuck

[Hook: Jacquees]
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
If he finds out, if he finds out
I don't give a fuck, no, yeah
I don't give a fuck, ay, ay
If he finds out, if he finds out

[Verse 2: Tink]
I can keep secrets
I love when you're deep in my tummy
Deep as the ocean, we're fucking and moaning like mummies
All I wanna know
Is how the fuck am I gonna get away with this one?
Cause I wouldn't be surprised if he strangled me
Kiss me on my thigh while you play with me
That's what keeps me here, lyin' to my man
Cheatin' in his bed, what if he finds out?

[Bridge: Jacquees]
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
Fuckin' with your bitch
You just shut up and take this dick
Oh, you just lay back and take this dick
Fuckin' with your bitch
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
His niggas ain't gon' do shit
You just lay back  and take this dick
Oh, girl you just lay back and take this dick

[Hook: Jacquees]
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
If he finds out, if he finds out
I don't give a fuck, no, yeah
I don't give a fuck, ay, ay
