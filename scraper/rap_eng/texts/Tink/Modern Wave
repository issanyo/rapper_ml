[Verse 1]
Are we off or on, I never know
Two weeks left in town and summer's gone
We've been up this hill for a very long time
Made up in my mind

[Hook]
I'm having fun tonight
Pull up and let's go ride
I'm on that modern wave
I'm letting go of this
And there are no regrets
I'm on that modern wave

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I'm in the house with my mind lost
I'm popping bottles, moving forward, with them brights on
You had your chance to make this fairytale come true but
You changed up your word, that's not how things work

[Hook]
I had to press restart, you have to play your part
I'm on that modern wave
I'm letting go of this
And there are no regrets
I'm on that modern wave

[Bridge]
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
Hands in the sky, it's a modern wave tonight
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
