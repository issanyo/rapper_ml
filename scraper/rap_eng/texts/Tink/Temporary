[Verse 1: Saba]

Castles turn into debris I feel like I've been here before
Shorty took five and lived through it that's more like a miracle
They gon' try to take you down when you get to your pinnacle
Some niggas will fall but some just stay up like the spiritual
You empty handed with a temper tantrum
If God is greed then by all means
Trade a silver lining for a silver dollar
You'll get in proper with an Impala
With ten toddlers niggas couldn't stay grounded
There's no humping on this side of town
It feel like ego gon' turn to C4
And melt this bitch down
I'll probably die an reappear as poor but more important
Got the people like a porter
Step in port authority woke up and found my soul
Now watch him probably pour it
I heard I write like a poet
Kobe said imma go on tour
Rest in peace my nigga
How we taking shit for granted
When this life is barely even yours
And now you vagabond
Funny they tagged along
Back when you had it all
You knocked on heaven's door
And asked them to spare change
They only sparing love
You probably run away
Everything's temporary

[Pre-Hook: Saba]

And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery
And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery

[Hook: Tink]

Everything is temporary
Who are you to judge me now
Even when I'm low and weary
I'll get up again somehow
Fuck you and your opinions
Fuck you and your opinions

[Verse 2: Tink]

So many dollars I ran for
Low to my due from my landlord
Chasing my problems with shots of the vodka
Like what am I gonna do?
Cause I'm only human they look at my bruises
And hit me with captions
If only you niggas knew how much I put into
Making it happen
You be the one in awe
I think about it all sometimes
Down on my luck I've had more than enough
But it's not the end of life
Cause everything, everything
Everything, everything


[Hook: Tink]

Everything is temporary
Who are you to judge me now
Even when I'm low and weary
I'll get up again somehow
Fuck you and your opinions
Fuck you and your opinions

[Verse 3: Saba]

Back against the wall like [?]
Getting off the floor like an ollie
Left you to pursue the dream I'm sorry
Looking at the TV ain't you sorry
I remember being hungry on the Blue Line
On my way to do recording
Who'd of thought you'd eat when you was starving
I'm just starting
But already I'm ready to call it quits
Then make the same record drop all them hits
If that's what it's taking to make a name
Then consider my new shit anonymous
Y'all know what time it is why do they try
Not to let us to live up to potential
My nigga we've been through a lot and I sent you
A prayer my Lord and my Savior
Let's celebrate every day that we brave
