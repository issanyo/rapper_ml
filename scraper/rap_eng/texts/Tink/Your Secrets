[Intro]
(I won't tell your secrets)
(Your secrets are safe with me)
(Oh baby if there is anything that you fear)
(Anything, anything, anything)
I think I really gotta get personal
I got to really let y'all in on, these oppressed emotions
Look

[Verse 1]
My boyfriend is my bestfriend, and my bestfriend is my better half
He motivate me when I'm feeling lazy, he the best thing that I ever had
He know my flaws and he know my past
But it never matters 'cause he still with me
It feel good to have you by my side
On them cold nights when I don't feel pretty
Them old nights when I shed tears
'Cause I heard the things that them niggas said
I ran to you, when I laid with you
And you never ask whats in between my legs
You never judge me for the things I did
You heard the rumors, but you never tripped
'Cause that was then, and baby this is now
When you got my word, I won't let you down
I promised to love you with all that I got
You can have everything and I won't take it back
'Cause I'm in it too deep, and I can't go a week
Without seeing your face and feeling your embrace
This shit is real, shit is real
I'll say it again, cause this shit is real
And I don't care how these niggas feel
Cause you understand what they never will
And that's me

[Chorus]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
Oh baby if there is anything that you fear
Anything, anything, anything
Oh baby if there is anything that you fear

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been so stuck in love
Feel like every move just wants a bit
But I'm still grateful, and I ain't complaining
'Cause a lot of women never find this
See it's hard to find somebody ready
It's even harder, keeping things steady
Cause faithful dudes, they don't come around
So when he come home, better take him down
I'ma freak on his body
I'ma cook and clean his laundry
I'ma treat my man so fucking good
And it's so lame, but he heaven sent
And without him, I'm not confident
If I can make it, or I can hold it
I tell him things, this is what he told me

[Chorus]
I won't tell (Promise that you won't tell my secrets) your secrets
(Promise me that)
Your secrets are safe with me
(It made me feel, it made me feel goodgood to know that he was in my corner)

[Bridge]
He slowed me down when I moved fast
When the other guys are just soaring past
He noticed me, he cool with me
When I told him I was going through some things
He held me down, he picked me up
Ran from me when I had enough
He laugh with me and he cried with me
And the time we spend, it's happening
It's your love

[Outro]
'Cause you know, guys don't really care about your feelings
You know, it just makes you feel good to know that there's somebody who's looking for you
And somebody that's gonna be there and always
And always have your back like...
Somebody who's always gonna look out for you
I really can't find anybody, anybody like but him so
When you have somebody that, that you can cry with 'cause you know
They know everything that you been through, and it's genuine you know
When they dont judge you, they look at you the same
