[Verse 1]
Mobbin' through the city in an all black trench
Fuck niggas looking at me thru' the fence
Cops on my phone tryin' to get me out my zone
Got to slow this shit down for this shit to make sense
Can't trust none of you niggas, I'm feelin' paranoid
It can be like any one of you snitchin'
But if anybody asks, I was never around
I think it's time a nigga [?] outta town
Ok, let's throw it
Bought a Greyhound ticket on the one way
Should've never shown the niggas where the guns stay
I regret I let you niggas into my business
'Cause now he in the jam, yellin' names like he takin' attendance
I got a branch where my hoodie on
I do it Death Row style, niggas betta keep a low profile
Snakes on the pavement
First 48 and man, these niggas already giving statements

[Chorus: Tink & 2Pac]
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
Trust no-body
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in
My closest friends, my homies, people who I done took care of they whole family
I done took care of everything for em, looked out for them, put 'em in the game
Everything! Turned on me!
Fear is stronger than love, remember that
Fear is stronger than love, all the love I gave, didn't mean nothing when it came to fear
So it's all good, but I'm a show you how I always survive, I constantly come back
Ya know what I mean?
Only thing that can kill me, is death, that's the only thing that will ever stop me, is death
And even then my music will live forever

Trust no men here
Not your friends here
Plot and talk
Sleep at night
Play both sides
Streets ain't real

[Verse 2: Tink & Timbaland]
Who the fuck is at my crib at six in the morning?
Bust down the door and then came in without a warning
Couped in the mix, handcuffs on my wrist
Gave me one phonecall so I had to dial Tim
What's up Tink?
Timbaland these niggas is all fakes
They tellin' on they brothers and buildin' 'em up a case
So you gotta get me out man it's time to switch up the route
It's far too many niggas in prison runnin' they mouth
I should've been aware of my surroundings
He a G up in the streets but a hoe up in the county
Should've cut 'em off like Road Rage
Niggas say they love you but somehow they wanna see you in the same cage
Nevermind that, too complex
You my nigga but you don't know where the bond at
Real talk, niggas better hold they own ground
When it all goes down, ain't nobody left around

[Chorus: Tink & 2Pac]
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
Trust no-body
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in
My closest friends, my homies, people who I done took care of they whole family
I done took care of everything for em, look out for them, put em in the game
Everything! Turned on me!
Fear is stronger than love, remember that
Fear is stronger than love, all the love I gave, didn't mean nothing when it came to fear
So it's all good, but I'm a show you how I always survive, I constantly come back
Ya know what I mean?
Only thing that can kill me, is death, that's the only thing that will ever stop me, is death
And even then my music will live forever

Trust no men here
Not your friends here
Plot and talk
Sleep at night
Play both sides
Streets ain't real
