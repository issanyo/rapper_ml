[Verse 1: Tink]
He say we like black cars
Black niggas in fast cars
Always make it happen
No matter what stakes are
We like real love
Rose petals up to the tub
We love it when we can chill
Long talks and short runs on the...
Beach

[Hook: Tink]
You should know it doesn't take much for me
(Doesn't take much) x2 (For me)

[Verse 2: Tink]
Just show me real effort
Couple minutes without the guys
Tell me no lies
Give me something I can take pride in
If everybody dippin', we ain't shit, fuck 'em
He just think I want his money
I just want the boy to love me on the...
Beach

[Hook: Tink]

[Bridge: Tink]
Could you love me
Please
(Doesn't take much) x2

[Verse 3: Tink]
Yo, got the club jumpin
Love me on the beach
Fuck it, we're on it now
Baby, tell the truth now
Don't hang out with those ratchet ass bitches
They learn
Do you wanna love me on the fuckin
Beach

[Hook: Tink]
