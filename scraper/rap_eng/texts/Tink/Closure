[Hook]
We need closure
I think we need closure
You say it's over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cause you was lost girl
And you just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Know it's been a minute but
I've been on my grind
You've been on my mind
Hoping you ain't in a rush
Know about your pride
Put it to side
I've been chilling in a cut
Look me in the eye, I ain't gon lie
I see other women but
They none like you I swear
I ain't gon lie no more
Don't wanna cry no more
We ain't gotta try no more

[Hook]
We need closure
I think we need closure
You say it's over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cause you was lost girl
And you just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us

[Verse 2: Tink]
Tryna end this chapter
Pussy all you was after
Called then I hang up, I don't wanna fuss but I want attention
And it can't be from another guy
Said that I was done never meant it once
Can't be with another guy, can't be on the other side
I love you, but I don't wanna cuff you
And it's nothing personal, I'm just used to you
And you're not the same, but why does this pain feel so good
Tell me to cut you off if I could

[Hook]
We need closure
I think we need closure
You say it's over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cause you was lost girl
And you just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us
