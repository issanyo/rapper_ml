[Verse 1]
We Were Only 13
Tree Tops and Swings
I'd Race You To The Corner (The Corner, Yea)
But We Wouldn't Go Far
Cause She'll Be Worried About You
And Then The Street Lights
I Meant To Say Goodbye
But We Said Hello, To All Of Our Fears
And If I Feel From My Bike, Ohhhh You'll Wipe My Tears

But Then They Came Strolling Down
And He Couldn't Wipe 'Em No More
Left in a big U-Haul
While I Was Sitting Down On My Porch

[Hook]
He Pulled Me Up
Quit Thinking That
I Just May Still Be In Love With You
And I Was Wondering If You Can Come Back To Me
And Maybe We Could Race To The Corner Again

[Verse 2]
Now Your Under this wing
College boy, The Major Leagues
How Does It Feel To Be Famous ?
Guess You Went Pretty Far
Reach For The Stars
And I Can't Handle Fantsize
Like Would If You Never Left
And What If We Were More Than Friends
What If I Had A Ring On My Finger

But Then They Keep Strolling Down
And He Can't Wipe 'Em No More
Writing a guy checks
While I'm Writing Letters, Letters In The Middle Of The Bathroom Floor

[Hook]
He Pulled Me Up
Quit Thinking That
I Just May Still Be In Love With You
And I Was Wondering If You Can Come Back To Me
And Maybe We Could Race To The Corner Again
