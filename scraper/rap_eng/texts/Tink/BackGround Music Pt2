[Verse 1]
Met you in the summer, loved you by the winter
Held you down through spring, so when it rains I don’t complain
Cause like love ain’t what it seems unless we argue over petty shit
"Why you ain’t text me back?"
You must been cooling with that other chick
Damn I can’t stay mad at you, put up with my attitude
And if I never told you thanks I’m showing you my gratitude
For being there and picking up listening when I won’t shut up
Promise not to hurt me, cause if you do then who can I trust
Lay my head up on his shoulder, tell me it’s gonna be alright
Sometimes I can’t even sleep unless I hear his voice at night
Momma she don’t understand it, everything ain’t so romantic
Everything ain’t squeaky clean but still I stayed up on your team
Cause I done did my wrong too, cried for me I cried for you
Hoping you forgive me cause if you ain’t rocking with me I might lose it
Put you before this music cause way before the fame the only one that knew my name was you you you

[Chorus]
Everybody knows regardless of these hoes when it’s said and done we got that special one we can’t leave
No matter where we go you’ll always be my very first love and the one I need
Cause I can’t find nobody, treat me like you treated me I know that you’re down for it all
This why I admire everything you do, give me thirty minutes let me sing to you
Regardless of these hoes when it’s said and done, we got that special one we can’t leave
So let me love you while the background music fades, fades, fades
Let me love you while the background music fades

[Verse 2]
Love you in the a.m. by  night time man I hate him
Cause he probably creeping ain’t no proof that he been cheating
So I keep quiet hope that everyone’s lying cuz they telling me rumors but I’m like fuck it he trying
Y'all know niggas ain’t perfect they gone cheat for no purpose
Leave you crying at home next day he blowing up your phone
I can’t resist I take him back, love is blind and that’s a fact
But I see you got everything I need lean on him like he’s codeine
I tell you all my secrets cause I know you keep them
I share with you my dreams cause you help me reach them
I’m in love with your presence cause you make me better
Can’t live without you so I’m praying we just die together
It’s fuck the weather I tell you we been through everything
The only difference is we ain’t wearing no wedding rings
But I’m waiting so patient ain’t no need for rushing
Because I give up the fucking world just to be left with nothing but you you you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby let me sing to you
Let me just admire you
I need you need you need you need you
Let me just love you while this background music fades fades fades
Oh baby yeah
