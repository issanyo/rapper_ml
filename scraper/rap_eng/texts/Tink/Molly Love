(HOOK )It´s College dorm room and we ain't really doing nothing as the time flies by

Might as well save this here for later rap up on these papers , we can finish once I make you mine
Cuz I dont really Know About You and I ain't never felt so good , im Hoping this stays for awhile swear we got that Molly Love
Yeahh , once its gone with the wind , you gone wanna feel it again , I'm hoping this stays for awhile . Swear we got that molly Love Yeaaaaah ´

I Go crazy I go Crazy I Go Crazy for you and if you let me i´ll just show you what i can do

Your not trippin then your dippin leave me looking for ya ; but i dont trip cuz it´ll be quick youll be back before I Know

Real Love I ain't never met ; they say its only real if it comes back but to be real you only come to fulfill

Knowing I let You in , I know this isnt Real but in the back of mind im thinking deeper got me hitting notes that i ain't even get hit by the aretha hit her then you leave her now her mindset is broken guess it feels good when my eyes ain't open

Cuz we know what it is when the phone ring can't get mad cuz when we know we on the same thing , pretend to be in love cuz it sounds right now you gone dissapear for another night then you come

And Then you Come back with another Love Story say you sorry that you promise you won't ingnore anymore hit the floor .In the morning when we wake up You´ll be gone NOW
