[Verse:1]

I know that some things in life are getting kind of rough
And I know that you're ready to throw the towel in
Thoughts go by too much like should I stay or just give up
And I won't lie I happen to know the feeling


[Chorus:]

But when ya think of letting go and slowing down (oh no)
When ya think that it's too hard just turn around (don't do it)
When ya think that maybe it's not meant for you (no)
Chances are it is and you gotta keep goin
So when ya think of letting go (oh please don't)
When ya think that it's too much your heart can't take no more
When ya think that maybe it's not meant for you (no)
Chances are it is and you gotta keep going


[Verse:2]

Now I'll be very honest it's not easy
I wanna share my story but you prolly won't believe me
Like how I died last night, if everyone expects for me in my life
To be this picture perfect story what about learning
What about praying, what about giving me a chance to explain it
I got a whole lot goin on in my life
And I missed out on so much that it makes me mad cause I can't live twice
And I wanna get right but I gotta get bread
To live nice and live life and live long
I put my heart up in this whole song
So why do they judge me, maybe I should stop get a job doin nothing



[Chorus:]
But when ya think of letting go and slowing down (oh no)
When ya think that it's too hard just turn around (don't do it)
When ya think that maybe it's not meant for you (no)
Chances are it is and you gotta keep going (going)
So when ya think of letting go (oh please don't)
When ya think that it's too much your heart can't take no more
When ya think that maybe it's not meant for you (no)
Chances are it is and you gotta keep going


[Bridge:]

Nobody said It'd be easy
We've come way too far just to leave me
Ya don't give up on me, I won't give up on you
It's time to wipe your eyes it'll be over very soon
I talk to myself sometimes cuz can't nobody understand me like I
Whenever ya goin through and its clouds in my view I just tell myself
Can't nobody but you stop this
So get out ya bed pick up ya head cause you got this
Yea I got this (oh oh)




So when I think of letting go and slowing down (no)
When I think that it's too hard or turn around (don't)
When I think that maybe it's not meant for me (don't)
Chances are it is and I gotta keep going (keep going)
So When I think of letting go (please don't)
When I think that maybe it's too much too handle (handle)
Oooh Oooh Oooh oh please don't
Chances are it ain't I just gotta keep goin



OUTRO:

Gotta keep goin, Gotta keep goin
I cry I cry I cry I cry I cry sometimes
But I gotta keep goin, but I gotta keep goin
Will you keep goin for me, keep goin for you
Keep goin for me
