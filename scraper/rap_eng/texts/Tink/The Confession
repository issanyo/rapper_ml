Steady giving me them lies, what you doing?
Why he have to play with my emotions
Told me he was with the guys, when I'm knowing
He linked up with Keisha from the low end
Why do all the faithful girls, get cheated on?
Get treated wrong?  Yeah, yeahh
That’s that type of shit that’ll drive you crazy
Crazy, crazy
Pull up to the crib, grab my 9, walk out the door
I'm gonna do me a drill tonight
Fuck he thought, forget what’s right
Talk about pain well I feel yours, so you'll feel mine
