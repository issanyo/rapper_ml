[Hook: Tink]
Seconds pass constantly
As time rolls soft over me
I feel my mind drifting
As my shallow breaths keep me sound at rest
I dream, forever asleep
But never at peace

[Pre-Verse: Alex Parker]
She say she a virgin
What, like born-again?

The clouds descend
The-the clouds descend
(x4)

[Verse 1: Alex Parker]
She say she a virgin
What, like born-again?
Or you mean like a virgin to dick
But got mad machines like Florence, then?
What're your influences?
Tell me, what are your beliefs?
Do you compare Martin or Bachmann?
Or just boxers or briefs?
I'm a boxer of speech
With a lyrical plethoraic monopoly
This unstoppable heat topples all the tops and the peaks
Floors rock when I speak
In with the poetic mojo, high as shit
Just stumbled over my old flow
Dead and gone, passed out on the cold floor
Rebirth it like the phoenix, syllabaic embers glow
And it shines so bright
I can see it glowing orange through my eyelids
So exciting and inviting
O flame, I still long to disappear inside it
And assemble all of my ashes and dust in to baggies
Spark 'em to ignite fits of genius and fanciful thoughts
That'll branch into complex REM dreams
And imagine-heavy schemes

And assemble all of my ashes and dust into baggies
Spark 'em to ignite fits of genius and fanciful thoughts
That'll branch into complex REM dreams
And imagine-heavy schemes
Hey

[Verse 2: Alex Parker]
The clouds descend, on my dead-ass neighborhood
The streets are fogged up in my dead-ass neighborhood
My neighbors, yeah they're living good
But I don't now them, they're strangers
See the moon shine on my neighborhood
And think "Damn man, shit changed"
I'm on my stomping grounds
But the crew that I stomped with is gone
But the crew that I stomped with is gone
But the crew that I stomped with is gone

See they knew me as Kevin the loser
And Kevin the sholar
To Kevin the jester
Now Kevin the stoner
To Kevin the Poet
Now Alex with bars
Nigga/Nerd/Nobody
But I'm normally odd
Morally flawed
Mentally scarred
Dentally dented
Soulless, I'm demented
I kiss hooded figures with skeletal fingers
And go off delirious, muggles won't get it
I'm lost, I have drifted to sea
Oh, Dear, it seems the feeling still lingers
Lost count of my days, I ran out of fingers
My dream... My dreams...
They're all-encompassing
My sleep, everlasting like Tuck
I've trespassed, now I'm stuck in the present
The future, I'm past it
Continuum halted, my neurons exhausted
Seconds pass me by as I...
Sleep

I'm just tired all the time...
