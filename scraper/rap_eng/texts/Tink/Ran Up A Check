[Intro]

(Tink)
Hundreds, fifties
I want it all. all of the money
Gimme the money, gimme the money, where the money


(Chorus)
Met him a month ago
Told him my money low
Told him I loved him, but really I didn't
I just wanted keys to his crib
Now I’m inside the place
Searching through closets
I’m running through wallets
I found the deposit
It's time to call up Rich the Kid

I just ran up me a check, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a check, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a, I just ran up me a check

I tell him please don't fall In love
I only commit to the plug
The money, the money, the money
Don't get finessed
I tell him what he wanna hear
Just so that I can get near
The money, the money, the money, ran up a check

[Verse 1: Tink]
Around 2 o'clock and I know that he works at noon
Come in through the back
Then I left the door open for you
I text him I missed him when really I should be an actress
Lay with him at night so I know that its up under the mattress
Flip it like an acrobat
I told him I will hit him back
I was stuffing that dough in my sack
(Cause I need me a check)
Snipping that white envelope
Had to ( ? )
We gone hit every spot if its hot we ride out on the jet
And I really didn't want to blood on you
If money get low I just want you to know running up in your crib's what I'm gone do
And I'm sorry
(So sorry)
I lied about one of your babies
It's a shame that you really believed me
For that money I'm gonna start [?]

(Chorus)
Met him a month ago
Told him my money low
Told him I loved him, but really I didn't
I just wanted keys to his crib
Now I’m inside the place
Searching through closets
I’m running through wallets
I found the deposit
It's time to call up Rich the Kid

I just ran up me a check, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a check, I just ran up me a check
I just ran up me a, I just ran up me a check

I tell him please don't fall In love
I only commit to the plug
The money, the money, the money don't get finessed
I tell him what he wanna hear
Just so that I can get near
The money, the money, the money ran up a check

[Verse 2: Rich Da Kid]
I just ran up me a check
Pull up in vet
Get me a dime on my neck
AP cost fifty I'm rich like I'm Diddy
I'm fucking with Tink in the city
That money that money that money
The fifty the twenty blue hundreds
Finessing the plug w a dummy he come from the country
Trap house jumping like ( ? )

Jumping and ( ? ) the Bentley
Talk shit but yo pockets is empty
You pouring the lean out the ( ? )
I roll with the hammer
Migo they get no bandanna ( ? )
I pull up they, pull out they camera
I roll with the sled like I'm Santa
Most of these hoes got no manners
They see me they take off they panties

(Chorus)
Met him a month ago
Told him my money low
Told him I loved him, but really I didn't
I just wanted keys to his crib
Now I’m inside the place
Searching through closets
