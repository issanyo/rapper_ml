[Chorus]
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
(repeat)

[Intro]
This is probably the realest shit that I ever wrote
This is, you know this is the realest I ever wrote
Yeah, these niggas out here
Can't fuck with em
I'ma let yall know what I mean
See

[Verse 1]
I love that nigga but he did me wrong
I love that nigga but he led me on
I love that nigga but I can't be jealous
Since I found that evidence up in your phone
You dicking her down
When you dicking me too
Replied to a text like "I miss you too"
Talking bout the freaky shit that yall gon' do
When just last night you was in my room
You so damn disrespectful
How you gon' do me like this?
I threw you bread when you was low
I paid for all your new fits
I outta spit on this bitch
I'm bout to start up some drama
I let you eat from my crib
Even introduced you to mama
And now you freaking my friend
I had like so many plans
Thought we was one day gon' get married
Honeymooned out in France
But now it's fuck love
Fuck love
You fucking her with no glove
Thought you was a real nigga
Fake shit what you made of

[Chorus]
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
She loves him
(repeat)

These niggas out here
They don't give a fuck
The way I feel about it
Why should we? You know what I'm saying
Niggas tell you they love you one day
And the next day go fuck your friends
But it's cool tho
It's fuck em
Cause at the end of the day
All you got it yourself man
These niggas don't care
Keep it real tho
You see

[Verse 2]
And now I'm looking dumb
Did all that record like "girl he the one"
Told my friends I couldn't wait for a son
When all the while you was having your fun
But it's cool
You ain't gotta worry bout shit no more
My tears gon' dry up
Cause by the time you done with that bitch
And you hit my line
I'll have a new line up
And it's crazy
Invested all my time in something that wasn't even worth it
I gave you my all
Just cause I thought that you deserved it
Guess not
Second chance? No sir
Fucked over my heart
Now it's time for you to just go fuck hers
And now he say I'm bitter
I got that from my next
But really it ain't my fault
I blame this shit up on my ex
And now I'm holding baggage
Can't get rid of these bad habits
Them prep talks ain't useful
Cause now I miss him
And I'll be truthful
I just

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I love that nigga
Love will make you do some crazy things
They say I'm
They say I'm stupid but I love that nigga
Yeah
Love how you fucked up one night
And ready to go back the next day
You feel me?
And that's love
So like
When I say this is the realest shit that I ever wrote
I really meant that
This shit was real
Yall probably say I'm crazy, you know
Cause I love that nigga but shit
It's real, one hunnit
That's love
I ain't gon sugar coat it, no
Yeah
I have to fucking think
