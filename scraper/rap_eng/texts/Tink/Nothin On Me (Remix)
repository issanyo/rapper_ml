[Intro]
She don't got
She don't got
It's the remix

[Verse 1]
Calling your phone who's calling your phone
That ain't your mom boy why it say unknown
You actin' like I'm tripping but I feel it in my bones
Ohh you been texting other hoes
Funny how things change and now you see that bitch a lame
She calling someone else bae, well that shit it don't surprise me

[Hook]
Oh you got a new bitch you think you got a new bitch
She ain't no new, she's a used
Oh you got a new bitch you think you got a new bitch
Well think again cause

[Chorus]
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 2]
Now you see these niggas chasing after me
You want me back but you need to stop asking me
For my love because it's gone
You did me wrong, so now I'm gone
I'm turning up and I'm chillin' in a party
You all up in my face telling me sorry
But I don't care, I flip my hair
Ain't that your new bitch over there
What if I treated you how you treated me
What if I did to you what you did to me
Too good to be true now you're missing me
And we both know that

[Chorus]
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 3: Tink]
Does she pass the test
Can she get this wet
Does she make you fall in love with one glance of her legs
Spot behind your neck does she touch it
Does she pull on them dreads while ya fucking
She ain't go nothing on me, I can tell by the way we rock
I can tell that you miss this shit
From the floor to the bed to the ride on top
Who's calling your phone one of ya hoes,  i know
But don't get confused cuz I do this shit she don't
I know that she don't get it up she prolly be tying you down
She all up on ya dick tryna make a scene
But she ain't got nothing on meeeee

[Chorus: Tink]
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She ain't got nothing on me
She can try to replace me but she ain't got nothing on me

[Outro: Toni Romiti]
Noooo, she don't got she don't got
Nothing on me and she never will and she never will
Ohhh ohhh yeaaa
It's the remix
It's the remix
