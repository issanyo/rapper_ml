[Intro]
Would you do the same for me?
Would you do the same for me?

[Verse 1]
I see I need someone crazy for my love, for my love
I need someone that’ll meet me there if I jump, if I jump

[Bridge]
Would you dive to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean for me
If the cops came running and I had no time
(It all depends on you)
Will you be a fool for your lady
I just want somebody thats crazy for my love

[Chorus]
Cause whether I’m down or whether I’m up
Going through things, you know it can get tough
Can I count on you, can I count on you
And if I pull the trigger will you bust back
You ain’t gotta ask, you know I’m gonna blast
Can I count on you, Can I count on you

To do the same for me, to do the same for me
Would you do the same for me, would you do the same for me

[Verse 2]
Cause baby, you gotta be ready
Living this lifestyle
I say baby, you gotta protect me
Ooh cause it gets so wild
On my side will you ride
Ride, whether I’m wrong or I’m right yeah

[Bridge]
Would you dive to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean for me
If the cops came running and I had no time
(It all depends on you)
Will you be a fool for your lady
I just want somebody thats crazy for my love

[Chorus]
Cause whether I’m down or whether I’m up
Going through things, you know it can get tough
Can I count on you, can I count on you
And if I pull the trigger will you bust back
You ain’t gotta act, you know I’m gonna blast
Can I count on you, Can I count on you

To do the same for me, to do the same for me
Would you do the same for me, would you do the same for me
