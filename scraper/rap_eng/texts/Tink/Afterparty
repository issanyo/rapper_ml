[Verse 1]
I got a new dress out
As I'm done and I'm bout to go out
So smokey in the room that I can't see nothing
There's a couch in the back
Every girl on a lap
Who's the boy in the letterman coat?
We're in a house full of cups
If you're feeling fucked up
To the upstairs room we'll go

[Pre-Hook]
Oooh oooh oooh
You tell me slowly that we can't stop now
Oooo oooh oooh
We gotta feel it till we both pass out
Oooh oooh oooh
C'mon boy lets hit the floor while the record plays
(while the record plays)
I wore this little dress for you

[Hook]
All night I've been waiting on you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty
All night I'm gone give it to you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty
Let's make this whole place come alive
Tonight let's not pretend that were shy
Cause all night I've been waiting on you

[Chorus]
I wore this little dress for you
(give it to me 3x)
I wore this little dress for you.[2x]
Let's make this whole place come alive
Tonight let's not pretend that were shy
Cause all night I've been waiting on you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty

[Verse 2]
Somebody dim out the lights
That's the cue to put your hands on my thigh
My drink just kicked up in me
You should hide my keys
While you undress me
Cause I probably won't make it to the crib
Throwing up in the hall
So we took it to the stall
And the party didn't even stop then

[Pre-Hook]
Oooh oooh oooh
Cause you tell me slowly that we can't stop now
Oooo oooh oooh
We're gonna feel it till it knocks us out
Oooh oooh oooh
So c'mon boy lets get back to the floor
While the record plays babe
I wore this little dress for you, yeah

[Hook]
All night I've been waiting on you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty
So all night I'm gone give it to you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty
Let's make this whole place come alive
Tonight let's not pretend that were shy
Cause all night I've been waiting on you

[Chorus]
I wore this little dress for you
(give it to me 3x)
I wore this little dress for you.[2x]
Let's make this whole place come alive
Tonight let's not pretend that were shy
Cause all night I've been waiting on you
Welcome to the
Welcome to the afterparty
