[Verse 1]
He like declare me, wet as an island
Order the room, yeah I want it private
Shawty wanna be the one, vacaying in the sun
Get on the plane, I'm seeing new things
He takin’ me down, he breakin’ the frames
It's feeling amazing
We threw the “quiet” sign on the door, he wanna make love on the floor
We gonna make love in the bathtub, then finish off with a backrub
House keeping saying keep it down, going at it and we hella loud
Black nigga with a black card, I'ma let him beat it like a gun charge, alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave that front window open for a breeze
Rollin’ high and getting faded overseas
He gon’ keep me with my toes in the sand
Yeah that’s my man and it go down when we land

[Chorus]
We M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
We M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I’m calling him daddy, we in the Valley
Threw on my heels, I’m keeping it classy
Shawty wanna be the one, vacaying in the sun
Dinner at 5, I hop in the ride
He rubbin' my leg, I want him inside, I want him inside
He keepin' it G and I'm feelin’ the vibe
Stretched out on the mattress, roleplaying like an actress
DeLeon on the nightstand and we turnt up like the hype man
He done put me on to the Balmain, floor seats at the ball games
Champagne on the airplane, I done woke up to a wet dream, uh huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave that front window open for a breeze
Rollin’ high and getting faded overseas
He gon’ keep me with my toes in the sand
Yeah that’s my man and it go down when we land

[Chorus]
We M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
We M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
M.I.A. (Yeah)
