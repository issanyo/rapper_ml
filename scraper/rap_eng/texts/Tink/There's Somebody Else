[Verse 1]
Come and take a walk with me
Look me in my eyes, when you talk to me
There's some things that we need to get off our chests, right now
Cause you never have the time no more
You're giving excuses, excuses get old
If there's someone else just tell me

[Hook]
(Say Yes)
There's somebody sleeping in our home
(Say Yes)
Found all of her pictures in your phone
(Say Yes)
That explains why you don't act the same
(Say Yes)

[Reprise]
Broke my heart in two (two pieces)
Didn't expect him to (say yes)
There's somebody else

[Verse 2]
(Well, Well)
Well is she pretty or what
Does she adore you and love you like I do (so confused, oh)
She must be some sort of superwoman
To take you away from the only one who came to your side

[Hook]
(Say Yes)
That explains why you're never home
(Say Yes)
Found all of her pictures in your phone
(Say Yes)
That explains why you don't actin' the same no more

[Reprise]
Broke my heart in two
Didn't expect you to say yes (say yes)
Broke my heart in two (two pieces)
Didn't expect you to say yes (say yes)
