[ Verse 1 ]
You're in love with another girl
And i'm so fucking jealous
To know you care for her, and no other girl
Damn you did your credit
Talkin' bout oooh, she don't appreciate you
And oooh, it makes me wanna hate you
For being stupid , sticking by that girl
When I'll be here forever

[Hook]
I try, I try, to speak my mind (yeah)
But the words, the words never come out
I'm dying each night, cause your not by my side
But the words, the words never come out
And I wanna say whats inside (whats inside)
But I got way to much pride

[Verse 2]
I miss your voice and texts at night , I think about them daily
Do you think of me at anytime?
At least give me a maybe (ooh)
I'll never find no one better and ooh we belong together
These are only thoughts, if only you knew
Maybe things be different

[Hook]
I try, I try, to speak my mind (yeah)
But the words, the words never come out
I'm dying each night, when your not by my side
But the words, the words never come out
And I wanna say whats inside (whats inside)
But I got way to much pride (ohh)
