[Intro: Tink]
This is the remix, yeah
This is the remix, yeah
Uh, oh-oh
Baby, my body's getting wet, yeah
It's like the first time for me
Daddy, daddy...
This is the remix, yeah

[Verse 1: Tink]
This is better than I expected
Never thought that I'd be pressing
Upon you for one more
You deserve a [?]
[?] a trophy ring
(You the champ, you the champ, you the champ)
This feels better than I expected
He says 'yes, baby, tonight I learnt my lesson'
This is pain, now... now that's my spot
This is loud as hell with the doors locked

[Hook: Tink]
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter, ayyy
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter

[Verse 2: Tink]
Feel it in my toes, I'm not letting go
Scratch you back up so you know how it feels
Put it down, turn around, that's what you like
Take me to the moon, do me till it's noon
This is freakier than Prince
Feel it in my legs, and my chest, and my neck
What a mess we made
Here, we are gonna have to get creative
Oh no, that's when it will be the greatest
'Cause we ain't coming down
So high up on the clouds
Smoking on tree
While you stroking on me

[Hook: Tink]
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter, ayyy
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter

[Verse 3: K Camp]
Most of these hoes come in, go by the season
Don't you see that I chose you for a reason?
Most of these lame niggas, so deceiving
Lay you on the bed, now your heart beating
Hit you with the pipe, then I had to go
I'm acting like I never had that ass before
You acting like you never had the bread before
I leave that ass walking funny like a fashion show
Hey, let me roll up another
Let you hit the weed while we fucking on the cover
She's thinking that I love her
I'mma just tryna [?] spread like butter
Get it right, make you call me daddy by the end of the night
Bet it feels good by the end of this flight
I'm just tryna do whatever that you like
It feels like

[Hook: Tink]
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter, ayyy
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter

[Outro: Tink]
Baby, my body is getting cold
Please don't leave me here alone
Baby, my body is getting cold
Please don't leave me here alone

[Hook: Tink]
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter, ayyy
These feels, these feels, these feels, Ju-Ju-Jupiter
