[Verse 1]
Talk to me mentally, wise from a symphony
'Cause you can’t hear and I can’t stand with all this arguing
Tried to connect with me, I found the epiphany
Like a mystery, you don’t seem to be
Who you were back then, now you’re just giving up
Now I’m swerving, thoughts start turning
I gave you all the signs and you still ignore it
So what the fuck am I to do?
Just get me to an empty room
No signal on this road we’re going down


[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, by now you'd have it
Can't fix one thing in silence
You say you care but you don't care like how I care
And that's fucked up
And what hurts the most is you don't want my love
My love, no

[Chorus]
Can't explain men
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel deep with your actions
I wanna feel more than attraction
I wanna get deeper then deep
If it’s not what I think then I think you should be more clear
Tell me you was down for the ride
I guess now the rules don’t apply for a nigga
And if we can’t draw close, baby, you’ll never get that picture
So talk to me but mentally, I wanna feel that chemistry
That we both had, we both had
My heart’s in between my mind
I love you but love is blind
It’s clear to see we’re going down

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, by now you'd have it
Can't fix one thing in silence
You say you care but you don't care like how I care
And that's fucked up
And what hurts the most is you don't want my love
My love, no, no

[Chorus]
Can't explain men
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel
Say what you wanna hear, they will
You’ll never understand how it feels, no, no
Trying to get through to a person
Who can't, who can't, who can't
Feel what you feel
