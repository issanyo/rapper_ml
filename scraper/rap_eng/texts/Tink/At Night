[Verse 1]
Love you in the front seat, travel down my waist
Take it to the balcony, right there in the rain
Love you in the swimming pool, better yet at the lake
Love you when the [?], while we bump Marvin Gaye

[Pre-Hook]
Ooh nobody has to know what we do, oh no

[Hook]
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
But I love it, oh I love it, when the freak comes out of you

[Verse 2]
Love you while we argue, raise your voice, raise your voice
Take it to the upper room, then to the floor, to the floor
I love you in front of the mirror, we can enjoy the view
I love you in front of the camera, press record

[Hook]
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
But I love it, oh I love it, when the freak comes out of you

[Verse 3]
Oh it sounds good when you talk to me dirty, real dirty
Look into your eyes while I'm on top flirting, flirting
Let me sing to you in your ear
Let me pleasure you while I'm here
Cause I'm the morning, I'll be your lady again
And on tomorrow, you'll have to wait til after 10

[Pre-Hook]
Cause ooh nobody's gonna know what we do

[Hook]
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
The freaks come out at night (oh yeah)
But I love it, oh I love it, when the freak comes out of you
