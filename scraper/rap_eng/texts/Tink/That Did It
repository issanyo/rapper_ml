[Intro: Tink]
That did it, that did it

[Verse 1: Tink]
You's a cocky mother fucker cause you love to run your mouth
They put me on the track cause they know I run this out of town
So if your head's big then I aim at it, better chill with all of that talk
Cause I go for mine, like a nine to five, and I still ain't take a day off
I be on fire like I am in hell, bitches want out but I can't give 'em bail
[?] like I should pull up with Sleigh Bells
Don't be afraid now, what did you say now? All that talk
I'm in your face now, what's wrong?

[Alexis]
What's wrong? I thought you had this

[Chorus]
[Alexis]
You thought [?]

[Tink]
That did it, that did it

[Alexis]
In the time it took to take a very deep breath
You were out of your depth, out of your depth

[Verse 2: Alexis]
You wan't a real fight tonight?
You're still living in your own world
The road isn't long, but it's winding
The future isn't bright, it's blinding
But a star is a medal on display
Always earned the hard way
And other lies and other rhymes
Where'd I put my keys?
Where'd I put my keys?

[Chorus]

[Alexis]
You aced the test, but failed the rest

[Refrain: Alexis and Tink]
Settle down with your infinite power
Settle down with your infinite power
Settle down with your infinite power
Settle down with your infinite power

[Tink]
That did it, that did it
