[Bridge]
All I wanna do is get this dough with you
Yeah, let's get money, babe
All I wanna do is get this dough with you
Yeah, let's get money, babe

[Verse 1]
I love the way you sag in your Robins
I love the way you talk when you're talking
I love the way you cool, you don't know too many dudes
You just chill up on your own and get the money, babe
I love the way you eat when you're starving
And I love the way you walk when you're walking
I love the way you're smooth, you don't have to act like a fool
You just chill up on your own and count them hundreds, babe

[Hook]
Money ova everything, money ova everything
He told me
Money ova everything
And then you get the wedding ring that you should
Money ova everything, we gone get this money on everything, babe
Money ova everything, and then you get the wedding ring

[Bridge]
All I wanna do is get this dough with you
(It's why I love you, and I trust you, I trust you, I trust you)
Yeah, let's get money, babe
All I wanna do is get this dough with you
('Cause boy I love you, and I trust you, I trust you, I trust you)
Yeah, let's get money, babe

[Verse 2]
I love the way we flex up in Neiman's
How bout we book a flight for the weekend
Just let me pack a bag, take a picture when we land
It's about to be a movie in the city, babe
I love the way you smart with your numbers
And I love the way you never throw me under
The bus, cause it's us making love till the game
It's a shame, we made it, babe

[Hook]
Money ova everything, money ova everything
He told me
Money ova everything
And then you get the wedding ring that you should
Money ova everything, we gone get this money on everything babe
Money ova everything, and then you get the wedding ring

Money ova everything, money ova everything
Oh, he told
Money ova everything, then you get the wedding ring
