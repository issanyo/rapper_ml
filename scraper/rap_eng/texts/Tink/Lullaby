[Intro]
Lullaby lullaby lullaby
Ain't nothing wrong, falling in love
Ain't nothing wrong
Lullaby lullaby lullaby

[Chorus]
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you never dreamed
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I’m gonna sing oh so sweet, boy you make my heart skip a beat
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I don’t wanna open my eyes, you give me life
You ease my mind like a lulla-lullaby
La la la la, la la la la, you ease my mind like a lullaby

[Verse 1]
Words can’t explain this vibe that you've given me baby
Above every ocean higher than a soaring place
Is where you’ll find me and my baby
Just like the stars in the sky, I hope you know you shine so bright to me
My only wish before I die, is that you able to spend your life with me
Cause..

[Chorus]
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you've never dreamed
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I’m gonna sing oh so sweet, boy you make my heart skip a beat
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I don’t wanna open my eyes, you give me life
You ease my mind like a lulla-lullaby
La la la la, la la la la, you ease my mind like a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Three little words but they mean too much
Three little words but they mean too much
Where would I be at without your love
Where would I be at without your love
Can't give it up, imma overdose
Swear every night I pray you know
The money don’t mean nothing, Ill still ride till the wheels fall off
And maybe thatll mean somethings, most of these girls they don’t want your heart
They wanna waste your time, I’m just so glad you're mine
You make me wanna cry lulla-lullaby

[Chorus]
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you never dreamed
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I’m gonna sing oh so sweet, boy you make my heart skip a beat
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I don’t wanna open my eyes, you give me life
You ease my mind like a lulla-lullaby
La la la la, la la la la, you ease my mind like a lullaby

[Outro]
I’m gonna sing oh so sweet
Open my eyes, you give me life
You ease my mind , like a
La la la la, La la la la
Like a lullaby
