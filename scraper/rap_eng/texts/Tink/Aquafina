[Hook]
He call me wet aquafina
Fucked up his head like amnesia
We off patron margaritas in this club
Peepin' you and you peepin' me and I wanna give you this and some
Guaranteed that by the time you leave you be singing about it like an anthem
Would it be alright, if I stay the night?
Give it all to you
And I'm not in love, but I feel a buzz
It's what I wanna do

[Verse 1]
Meet you in the back while I take off your clothes
We got an automatic chemistry
I want you to power off your phone, don't let no one in this room
We gon' send this bitch up tonight
It's now or never, put it all together
You hit this it's like the lotto
You know my motto
What happens here stays here, what happens here stays here
When you and me we move fast
Ain't no limit to the cash
You've been staring for the past 20 minutes
And I can't even drive home, I don't want to sleep alone
Won't you let me put you on?

[Hook]
He call me wet aquafina
Fucked up his head like amnesia

Peepin' you and you peepin' me and I wanna give you this and some
Guaranteed that by the time you leave you be singing about it like an anthem
Would it be alright, if I stay the night?
Give it all to you
And I'm not in love, but I feel a buzz
It's what I wanna do

[Verse 2]
Take back shots, now you're talking patron
If I let you hit this cup, you'll be saucy as Post Malone
But I'm posted in the front so these bitches know where to find me
Not in here with kim, but my lips is poking like Kylie's
Imma got get her, who throws it back like a picture
I've been really bent off this liquor tonight
You need me like a stoner, give you my heart like a donor
I'm here if you need a shoulder, alright
Fuck that right now, I'm tryna get one off
Take me for a ride, man your seat feels so soft
I wanna kiss your from your head to your shell toes
These other niggas clowns with their red nose

[Hook]
He call me wet aquafina
Fucked up his head like amnesia

Peepin' you and you peepin' me and I wanna give you this and some
Guaranteed that by the time you leave you be singing about it like an anthem

Give it all to you
And I'm not in love, but I feel a buzz
It's what I wanna do

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, I really wanna love you babe

Grab another bottle before we go
Pull over and do me on the road
Ain't nobody fucking with me no, no, no, no

Why won't you let me love you babe
Is you gon' let me love you babe?
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Woah, oh baby, yeah, yeah
