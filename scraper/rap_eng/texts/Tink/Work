[verse 1: Bekoe]
No days off
They say hard work pays off
So imma go get that check
Then imma flex like a boss

Im Finessing no stressing
These hoes they call me a blessing
If she thirsty for sexing
I give that b*tch the rejection
Going hard no erection
Keep the steel for protection
Middle fingers to haters
I swear Tink G out here repping

Westside I be reppin
Till the death of me ni**a
Working all year round
Even the holiday Ni**a
See I manage myself
Cause I can't trust no ni**a
When they cut me that check
I'll be a self made ni**a

Fuck slaving for that money
These ni**as out here on dummy
Since i'm making this paper
B**tches wanna take it from me

Working over time
Yea I over grind
School of hard knocks
Shoot them down like the columbine
And my block hot
Everyday it be a homicide
This is my job little ni**a
F**k a 9 to 5

[Hook: Bekoe]
No days off
I'm on my job year round
I'm working hard all day
I keep my feet to the ground
My occupation
Is getting paper and stunting on my haters
My ni**as put in work
And we ain't doing no favors

(Watch me)

Work, Work, Work
Work, Work
Work, Work, Work
Work, Work

Work, Work, Work
Work, Work
Work, Work, Work
Work, Work

[Verse 2: Tink]
I'm working monday through sunday
I'll take a break when I'm gone
If you not trying to get money
Ni**a we won't get along

I need a cape on my shoulder
Because I've flying through mula
You interfere with my paper
Then bullets fly through medulla's

I'm talking heads shots
Pictures frames
No detergent hitting stains
Hit the club spend it all
Get it back That's Boomerang

Orangoutangs out in that jungle
Go to school and learn to hustle
Ni**as out here starving watch your play
Cause the waiting for fumbles

And they gone take it all just like a prostitute
I dare a B*tch to give me problem
Better off the truth
And I don't play no games
I check a bag and keep it moving
Find me in the booth
Pen and pad just like a college student

That's work homie no sick days and no off days
Keep grinding
Keep Grinding
Every minute counts like a prepaid

I been paid and you been mad
You got the sh*t that i been had
Better double up on yo shifts hoe
Tink G I'm getting hella doe

[Hook: Bekoe]
No days off
I'm on my job year round
I'm working hard all day
I keep my feet to the ground
My occupation
Is getting paper and stunting on my haters
My ni**as put in work
And we ain't doing no favors

(Watch me)

Work, Work, Work
