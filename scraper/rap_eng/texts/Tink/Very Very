[Intro]
Baby we should wake up and get married
(Married, married, married, married)
Cookin' Soul

[Verse 1]
My nigga, my nerve
I love when he swerve
Pull up and sit on the curve
Picking me up, showing me off
To them bitches who looking and hoping one day that they fuck
The type of nigga I can trust, the type of nigga never fuss
He just let me run my mouth
Pull down my panties and make it so wet I forget what I was mad about
Lot of niggas can't relate though
Lot of niggas do be fake though
Like, why you never witcha baby?
You put a nigga 'fore your lady
The reason I'm rolling, I'm rolling for mine (Mine)
If anything happen I'm riding next to him
And holding his 9
To niggas he don't condone it
Baby you know where your home's at
I wait up until you get in, fuck having friends
I can give you all of that and more
He beat it up until it's sore
Love him cause with him I feel so secure
Baby I'm grateful got me a nigga who know how to be faithful

[Chorus]
Baby we should wake up and get married (Married)
We ain't in no rush but this is very (Very)
Very very very very special
Very very very very special
Baby we should wake up and get married (Married)
When it comes to your love there's no comparing (-paring)
Very very very very special
Very very very very special

[Verse 2]
My nigga, my nerve
Good on his word
I never complain, in love with the way he behaves
Keeping shit one double O, the kinda nigga they don't make anymore
I know because he really love me, never over does it
He just be himself
Plus I don't have to worry about another woman coming
He ain't out here fucking nobody else
I was taken from behind
He said if he got it then so do I
Type of nigga I respect like the law
Type of nigga that I let hit it raw
My love for him is deeper than the South Pacific
He tells me when I ride his boat the water feels terrific
Yeah, you just excite me like its recess
You can have whatever you request
Throw his timbs, take off his V neck uhh
No better feeling than feeling him when he's faithful
I wear him out, he sleep in it like its his cradle

[Chorus]
Baby we should wake up and get married (Married)
We ain't in no rush but this is very (Very)
Very very very very special
Very very very very special
Baby we should wake up and get married (Married)
When it comes to your love there's no comparing (-paring)
Very very very very special
Very very very very special

[Outro]
(Baby we should wake up and get married x3)
