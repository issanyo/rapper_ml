[Hook]
I'm stepping outta line
I'm stepping outta line

[Verse 1: Tink]
Boy you gotta slow down
You move away too fast
Looks like I got more than you can handle
There's another man beside you
And he's good to me
But not good as you
You show me all the freaky things that he doesn't do
Oh I said, this shit has to stop
Know when he's gone, you can hit my spot
You got me so confused
'Cause a lot of men just come and go, we're stepping out that friendzone, tonight
Don't get me in trouble
Actin' like a couple

[Hook]
I'm stepping outta line
I'm stepping outta line

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
Don't wanna slow down
Wanna put my hands on your body parts
Tonight you're having it your way
Don't you ask for his permission
Did I mention?
I'm in love with switching positions
Wanna fuck you in the kitchen
Imma hit it from the side he don't
It's a shame he don't
Treat you like you the queen that's on a throne
All the games he on
Wanna let him go, but you holding on
The love is gone
I got you confused
It's the shit that we do, yeah
I'll keep you wet all night
No dry spot, let's take this shit to my spot
Ain't tryna make your spot hot
Aye fuck your nigga, I'm your side guy

[Hook]
I'm stepping outta line
I'm stepping outta line
I'm stepping outta line
I'm stepping outta line
