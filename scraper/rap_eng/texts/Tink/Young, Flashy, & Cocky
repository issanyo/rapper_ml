[Hook: Matti Baybee] x2
I got money all in my pockets, takin off like rockets
Pulled up in that 'rrari but I pulled off in that 'gatti
This song so rockin' , main chick she jockin'
I'm just young, flashy and cocky, I'm just young, flashy and cocky

[Verse 1: Matti Baybee]
First I'm startin, so abnormal flights, magic carpets
Homie I'm the man, I'm the man no martin
Target, you could be the target
I'm tryna milk the game until I fill up a carton
Homie I'm sparkin, baby I'm sparkin
Yeah I got a army an you can meet the Spartans
They done got me started
Now I'm finna finish em
All these rappers sweet yeah they sweet just like cinnamon
I'm young an I'm getting it
Young an I'm gifted
And if homie disrespect we'll twist him just like licorice
See my swag ridiculous, check my swag ridiculous
If he ain't talkin benjamins, well homie I ain't interested
Matti Baybee young legend I shine glitter
I'd rather spend money on her that time with her
And I pulled up in that 'rrari but I pulled off in that 'gatti
Cause I'm young flashy and cocky

[Verse 2: Matti]
Two for the money, one for the 'one time'
I be knocking out these rappers with the punchline
I swear I'm killing the game leave 'em all dead
Going crazy, steady shining like a bald head
Matti Baybee , homie I'm what everybody talking
President, no squares in my oval office
Murderers, everything I leave it in a coffin
If he say that I ain't winning then obviously he lost it
Cuz' I'm bossin', I'm bossin' the way I'm counting
So much money piled up, it look like a mountain
Throw that money in the air, watch those broke boys count it
I need an accountant, don't know what the amount is
Everyday I'm cashing, money steady stackin'
Just in case you ask me, I'm just young and flashy
Everyday I'm cashing, money steady stackin'
Just in case you ask me, homie I'm young and flashy

[Verse 3: Tink]
Young, flashy, and he cocky too
Poppin bands, so I'm sweatin you
I forgot the O, when he swerving through
Got his bands up, you need a parachute
To get close to it
We don't leave tips , tell em keep the change and leave em filthy rich
Got a big ole bank, so what you know about it
And getting money is my only hobby
Lot a people talking like my team ain't really eating
We drop 30, then drop 40, like LeBron during his season
Boy that's major
That young boy about his paper
Couple zeros on that check so I can't help but count these haters
They multiplying
Keep it on lock, no door knob
More money then a couple dudes wit a job
Stacking bread till I get me a loaf
Heat up in the whip , you don't even need a coat
Need a boat I'm piled up in it
So official I should run for the senate
Cause I'm young and I know how to get it
And time is still money I can't even take a minute
Off, foreign, gloss, it feels good to be your own boss
I'm that chick, I feed my clique, and we count money till we get sick
No vaccines cause it gets no better
Keeps going like a four page letter
Cause I'm young and cocky
Who gon' stop me?
Keith Sweat, I tell em nobody
