[Intro]
Keep that shit real
Keep that shit trill
Most dudes can't handle me
Most dudes can't handle me
(repeat)

[Hook]
Kush too fucking strong, we been rolling all night
If your nigga do you wrong, bet this blunt gon' make it right
Hit it once, and hit it twice
Hit it three times, then you lit
It's like I'm honest when I'm sober, but I'm better when I'm lit
When i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit, when i'm, when i'm lit
When i'm lit', when i'm, when i'm lit

[Verse 1]
Look, what if I told you that I love you but I love your money
Would you hide all of your visa's and start acting funny
What if I told you, you my main but I got other dudes
And every time I ain't with you, I'm with my other moves
If I kept it trill and told you that I need my space
You irritate me, every time you show up at my place
What if I told you that you bore me and it's no longer fun
And why we talking, I been texting two niggas at one
Is that too much? News flash, did you get that picture?
I hate yo' mama, she too nosey
Right along with yo' sista'
What if I told you that I care, but I don't care enough
Told him it was on silent, but it wasn't
I just ain't pick up
And I really don't give no fucks, love has been erased
I had to clear out all our memories, this shit can't be saved
And I could be wrong, but we leaning right
All these niggas wanna do is cut, get them out of sight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, what if I told you that I lurk on all your twitter mentions
And I get jealous, every time you show these hoes attention
What if I told you that I used to cry like every night
Used to ask the Dear Lord, why?
Like why we can't just get it right?
I'm just being one hunnit, this shit hella' true
And since we being honest, I been cheating too
What if I told you that your guys ain't really your dawgs
I would show you messages, but I delete them all
But I'm starting not to care, cause it's becoming pointless
It's like my heart feels out of place, I guess I'm double jointed
No double dates, what if I told you to your face
See your best man, is your best friend
But your best friend is my new man, hold on
I think that's too strong, karma lighten up
And if you mad I wrote this song, I still don't give a fuck
I'm Tink G, so I had to keep it real
Take a hit of that loud, and express just how I feel

[Hook]
