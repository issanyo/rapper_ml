[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Place me on your counter
See what gets me louder
Once I undress
Boy I got some hips now
Something to hold on to while we're in bed
And it's all for you
Even though I can have any nigga that I choose
If you let me put it in your face
I'll work you like you're employed
Something you will enjoy, yeah
He off the D'usse
I been rolling too so no I don't feel none of the pain
He hit this pussy so good
That I might wake up and tat out his name
Oh, yeah
We be fuckin' till the sun comes up

[Hook]
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters

[Verse 2]
No nigga fuckin' with the one that I got
A place you can hide when the city is hot
I know it ain't safe when you in that field
So keep me in mind when you get in motion
Never missin' like your name Frank Ocean
You know just how I feel
I can't get through to you when you're off them pills
So come home to me every night and I'll please you
Boy would you like a laced two piece you can see through?
Cause I'm horny

[Hook]
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters

[Verse 3]
All I see is rain and thunderstorms in the news weather report
Boy I wouldn't ask you for nothin' that you couldn't ask me for
Money so thick it won't fit in my jeans
He say it's wet as the navy, marines
Spinnin' up on him like he was a globe
Cookin' him breakfast with no panties on
No panties on

[Hook]
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters
When I'm with you, nothin' else matters

[Bridge]
I love the way you smell
So I drive a thousand miles
Just to make love to you
Just to make love
Just to make love
I love the way you smell
I drive a thousand miles
Nothing else matters

[Outro]
Hey Tink I have another question
How do you, how do you know what matters most to you?
Do you have to balance it?
Business? Music? Love? Sex?
There is a no balance
Everything in my life it's, it's just a gamble
It's all about just upgradin' it, progression
