[Hook]
These diamonds
These diamonds
These diamonds
These diamonds
These diamonds
These diamonds

[Chorus]
You might kill this pussy like a real weapon
Can you dive in it? Like Odell Beckham
If you can, I may dance like Mizhani
But, I'm so sorry cause
The last little bitch was a fan for the team
Shoulda never put her on the glo
You never look alive when you with her
And you the one shining the most
Put you in a real good space
You ever took a ride in a Wraith?
End of the day I'm paid
Keep it 1 thou' that's a real upgrade

[Verse 1]
I'm a real upgrade
Keep it 1 thou
She ain't fucking with my style no, no
You need someone that you know ain't gon' tell
I'll scoop you up when she giving you hell
Look at me baby

[Hook]
I-I-I know you see the diamonds
(These diamonds, these diamonds, these diamonds)
I call it perfect timing
And I got that uh-uh if you like it
Better keep this shit exciting

[Verse 2]
She ain't even half the size
And you know it
Court side seats
I get them then blow it
Champagne for niggas in high places
Stay in that bitch mouth
No braces
Straight to the point
Like a head start
Fucking up a check no advance
I do this on my own

[Chorus]
You might kill this pussy like a real weapon
Can you dive in it? Like Odell Beckham
If you can, I make ends like Mizani
But, I'm so sorry cause
The last little bitch was a fan for the team
Shoulda never put her on the glo
You never look alive when you with her
And you the one shining the most
Put you in a real good space
You ever took a ride in a Wraith?
End of the day I'm paid
Keep it 1 thou' that's a real upgrade

[Verse 3]
This that shit that make you wanna dive in
Put this to your neck like these violins
I can change your life
Let's be honest, honest
You right here where you supposed to be
Laying so close to me
I love you
And it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong
Cause you ain't gotta play along
Baby, she used you
Can't get enough of the sex we have
Need you to know
That I hope it last
I love you
She all gassed up like '93
You act so blind
When it's plain to see
She used you

[Chorus]
You might kill this pussy like a real weapon
Can you dive in it? Like Odell Beckham
If you can, I make ends like Mizani
But, I'm so sorry cause
The last little bitch was a fan for the team
Should a never put her on the glo
You never look alive when you with her
And you the one shining the most
Put you in a real good space
You ever took a ride in a Wraith?
End of the day I'm paid
Keep it 1 thou' that's a real upgrade
