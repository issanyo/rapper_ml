[Intro]
Can I.. See what’s real?
See what’s really real?
Promise you won’t judge me, promise you won’t judge me
See what’s real
See what’s really real
Promise you won’t judge me

[Verse 1]
It was like…
We were pretty faded right after the dance
Feeling on each other, peeping down his pants
Look me in my eyes and tell me you love me
Promise me tonight, you won’t try to fuck me

[Bridge]
But who am I kidding? We’re both up in the mood
I’m all dolled up and looking good too
We in the backseat, I’m like “Oh yeah!”
Let’s get it one time, call it a homecoming

[Chorus]
We gone do it, do it
In your letterman’s jacket
The shit right here we won’t ever, ever forget
We was in the backseat like “Oh yeah!”
We did it one time after our homecoming

[Verse 2]
[?]
I hope we don’t wake up and regret this
Cause boy ima kill you if you tell your friends
He like
“Baby, don’t you worry. Just give me a kiss
Why you so uptight? We just having fun”
I’m like
“Yeah, damn you right. Please pass me the blunt”
Cause we in the backseat, I’m like “Oh yeah!”
Let’s get it one time, call it a homecoming

We gone do it, do it
In your letterman’s jacket
This shit right here we won’t ever, ever forget
We was in the backseat like “Oh yeah!”
We did it one time after our homecoming
