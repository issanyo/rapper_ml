[Verse 1]
Iâ€™m loving the moment
Tell me that you want it
Boy come get up on it
Cause I know that you're fiending
Let me know you mean it
Words were meant for speaking
Can we talk on the weekends?
Cause lately I've been lonely
Remember what you told me

[Hook]
If you just have the time spend it here with me
Dont worry 'bout your past or my history
Cause that don't even matter when you're here with me
I just want your time

[Chorus]
I don't think it's too much to ask from my personal view
If I give you one hundred, then you gotta give me that too
I just want your company, wondering if you want mine
I'm not asking for much...
I just want your time
Time, time, time, time, your time
Time, time, time, time, your time

[Verse 2]
Think I need a minute
It's been a while since we kicked it
You told me you are with it
So lets link when you touch down
Do you have time for love now?
Tell me tell me patience
It's so hard when I'm waiting, for you
For you...

[Hook]
If you just have the time
Spend it here with me
Dont worry 'bout your past or my history
Cause that don't even matter
When you're here with me
I just want your time

[Chorus]
I don't think it's too much to ask from my personal view
If I give you 100, then you gotta give me that too
I just want your company, wondering if you want mine
I'm not asking for much...
I just want your time
Time, time, time, time, your time
Time, time, time, time, your time

[Outro]
I just want your time
(Spend it with me)
I just want your time
(Spend it with me)
I just want your time
(Spend it with me)
I just want your time
(Spend it with me)
