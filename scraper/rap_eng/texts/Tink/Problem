[Hook: Sasha Go Hard]
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model

[Hook: Sasha Go Hard]
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM

[Chorus: Sasha Go Hard]
I think I'm a problem, take ya' nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho, like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model
I don't see any ho harder, them dollars it's not a problem
I want it, get bread, I cop 'em, don't trust me, man, I'll be plottin' dollas'
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob you
I'm hot like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model
I don't see any ho harder, them dollars it's not a problem
I want it, get bread, I cop 'em, don't trust me, man, I'll be plottin' dollas'

[Verse 1: Sasha Go Hard]
So you saying that I'm a problem, stop playing, ho, come and solve 'em
I'm coming up from the bottom, my mentality is "fuck 'em"
Got this money coming out tho, on a pretty little model
Snatch ya' man, he broke a bin, he popping tags like he a column
I'm hungry so I be eating, no nigga living I'm needing
I pray, just shout out to God, hate them bitches, get that a lot
No friction, keep it 100, these bitches begging for promo
I'm headed to the UK, I ain't local, ho, I am global
They love you, then they diss you
I'm the shit, go get the tissue
Get hundreds in my wallet, pop a bill without a pistol
He eat me then he kiss you, my pussy in his visual
Hey TLC, what this do, to them bitches I'm an issue

[Chorus: Sasha Go Hard]
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho, like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho, like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model

[Hook: Sasha Go Hard]
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM

[Verse 2: Tink]
Treat bitches like crickets, I hear 'em but don't acknowledge 'em
Basic bitches follow like scientists through a fossil print
I'm beasty with these lyrics, I'm crazy and this ain't medical
I might just take your nigga, he chewing me like I'm adderall
I don't want his numba', he tryna' to holla with zero's
These bitches ain't got no hobby, man they watching me like some Vevo
He branded me like a scholar, he graduated with honors
I never could trust a bitch cause they snaky like two piranhas
That's a problem
I don't think that they feel me like Novocain
That bitch is messy, if she throwing dirt up on my name
I'ma clean it up as if my first name Carlton
These rappers are my kids now add the G cause I'm your guardian

[Chorus: Sasha Go Hard]
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya
I'm hot ho, like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model
I think I'm a problem, take your nigga, bitch, I rob ya'
I'm hot ho, like some lava, skinny pretty bitch, a model

[Hook: Sasha Go Had]
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM
I THINK I'M A PROBLEM, I THINK I'M A PROBLEM
