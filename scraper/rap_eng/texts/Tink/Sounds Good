[Verse 1]
They say pussy is pussy don't let it phase you
Shit after all the tears and affection that's what it came to?
You show a nigga love and he manage to hide it all
He won't admit when he's wrong, but I'm petty for moving on
You got a lot to learn, you still young and immature
I bought into all your lies you're such an entrepreneur
Fuck you, you know you hurt me in the worst way like Jhene said
Painted this false image like I was some sort of JPEG
Thought that I was special you told me you would be gentle
You used me like a rental that really fucked with my mental
I thought the shit was love and I'm telling people we straight
I'm embarrassed, same nigga been cheating right in my face
I got a lot to learn
Act like i'm cool, but it still burn
Sad to know that loyalty ain't nothing, but a vague word
I used to let you say anything like a dummy
Now all I ever think when you try and tell me you love me
Is that it sounds good

[Chorus]
Boy you know just what, just what you done to me
Oh, what you done to me
Boy you know just what, just what you done to me
Oh, what you done to me

[Bridge]
Cause I thought that I was good enough
I thought we had a lot of trust
I thought you would be faithful, if I wasn't going through your stuff
I thought I was the only one
I thought this here was more than fun
I thought that if I gave it up you wouldn't need to find you none
I thought that I meant more to you
I thought that all your homies knew
I thought that you was special
You was nothing more than stressful
Man, I thought that we had a bond
Shit, I thought that you was mine
When I thought that it was real you turn around and play the field
I got to go

[Verse 2]
They say pussy is pussy don't let it phase you
Hardest part about it is hoping it doesn't change you
Cause now my heart is cold and I'm looking for my revenge
And I'm fucking with niggas heads
And they're paying for what he did
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just broken and need healing
I put it all on the line and he ruined my sense of feeling
Wasted all of my time, and that's something I won't get back
So, whenever I'm moving forward it's hard for me to adapt
You don't get it, I'm insecure all because of you
It make me look bad when the bitches ain't even cute
You just had to fuck it up
You was loveable, I was gullible
They supposed to know that my nigga is untouchable
They supposed to envy what we got as we embellish
Man, you're not supposed to like them
You're supposed to make them jealous
What the fuck?
Now every other niggas out of luck
Cause even if they do me right
I still hurt them out of spite
Like it sounds good

[Chorus]
Boy you know just what, just what you done to me
Oh, what you done to me
Boy you know just what, just what you done to me
Oh, what you done to me
