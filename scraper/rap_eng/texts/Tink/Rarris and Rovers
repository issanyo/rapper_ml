Rarris and rovers, rovers
Boy won't you scoot over
Rarris and rover, rovers
Boy won't you scoot over

[Hook]
Rarris and rovers
Boy won't you scoot over
Let me be your ride or die
We gon count these millions
Just don't catch no feelings
Put that shit on hold
We got time
Rarris and rovers
Boy won't you scoot over
Let me be your ride or die
We gon count these millions
Just don't catch no feelings
Put that shit on hold
We got time

[Verse 1]
[?] so I'm on the go
My top missin' like Amber Rose
To top it off I don't need a man
It's like drumline the way I keep a band
I cash out then I gotta swerve
Green, green I mix that
My money sitting
Uh-huh
So when you gotta move  and you need me
You know to pick up that phone and get to dialing
Cause we gon do some numbers
And we ain't gettin no younger
Might as well get it while we can

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin more important then the mulah
Ans niggas come second like juniors
I'm fuckin niggas up like a [?]
Cause I stay up in the booth, no payphone
Nigga pay phone, always keep callin
Like gym time, nigga I'm dodgin
I'm tryna get money for the team now
Ima raise that shit like a girl scout
Never been a rookie though
I put niggas on the side like a dinner roll
See I got that ceasar salad
Dressing so fly, call me thousand island
I talk big shit and I live it too
& my team don't change like a fitting room
We gettin to the paper
Talk to you later

[Hook]
Rarris and rovers
Boy won't you scoot over
Let me be your ride or die
We gon count these millions
Just don't catch no feelings
Put that shit on hold
We got time
Rarris and rovers
Boy won't you scoot over
Let me be your ride or die
We gon count these millions
Just don't catch no feelings
Put that shit on hold
We got time

[Verse 3]
Thank yall niggas that's watchin me
These hoes goin fast like five for three
These bitches ain't real, lets just send em back
I'm close to the door like that handicap
That money coming, my phone buzzin
They like my tracks, thats Harriet Tubman
I'm underground with no rail road
And I got money, no fishing pole
I'm up all night like I can't sleep
Sittin on bitches like I'm Mr.C
My name ringin bells, symphony
