Let me love you by the background music
Let me love you by the background music (fades)

(Verse 1:)
Met you in the summer, loved you by the winter
Held you down through spring, so when it rains I don’t complain
Cause like, love ain’t what it seems, unless we argue over petty shit
‘Why you ain’t text me back? You must’ve been coolin’ with that other chick’
Damn, I can’t stay mad at you
Put up with my attitude
And if I never told you thanks, I’m showing you my gratitude
For being there and picking up
Listening when I won’t shut up
Promise not to hurt me, cause if you do, then who can I trust?
Lay my head up on his shoulder, tell me it’s gonna be alright
Sometimes I can’t even sleep, unless I hear his voice at night
Mama she don’t understand it
Everything ain’t so romantic
Everything ain’t squeaky clean, but still I stayed up on your team
‘Cause I done did my wrong too
Cry for me, I cry for you
Hoping you forgive me, cause if you ain’t rockin’ with me I might lose it
Put you before this music, ‘cause way before the fame, only one that knew my name
Was you, you, you…


Chorus:
Everybody knows, regardless of these hoes
When it’s said and done, you got that special one we can’t leave
No Matter where we go you’ll always be, my very first love and the one I need
Cause I can’t find nobody, treat me like you treat me
I know that you’re down for it all
Just why I admire everything you do
Give me thirty minutes let me sing to you
Regardless of these hoes, when its said and done
You got that special one we can’t leave
So let me love you while the background music fades…
Let me love you while the background music fades…

(Verse 2:)
Love you in the AM; by nighttime man I hate him
Cause he probably creepin’ ain’t no proof that he been cheatin’
So I, keep quiet, hope that everyone’s lyin’
Cause they tellin’ me rumors, but I’m like, fuck it, he tryin’
Y’all know niggas ain’t perfect, they gone cheat for no purpose
Leave you cryin at home, next day he blowin up yo phone
I can’t resist, I take him back
Love is blind and that’s a fact
But I see you got everything I need
Lean on him like he’s Codeine
I tell you all my secrets, cause I know you keep ‘em
I share with you my dreams, cause you help me reach ‘em
I’m in love with your presence, cause you make me better
Can’t live without you so I’m just praying that we die together
It’s fuck the weather, I tell you we been through everything
The only difference is we ain’t wearin no wedding ring
But I’m waitin, so patient, ain’t no need for rushin
Cause I give up the fuckin world just to be left with nothing
But you, you, you…

Chorus
