[Verse 1]
When you come tonight, squeeze me tight
Hold me close, kiss my cheek, caress my soul
Take good care, stroke my hair, make me blush
Go so deep that my hymen is fucked
You know it's been some time since I've tried guys this young
Not too many of 'em are honest
But he holds it down, stands his ground, play his move
Doesn't rush to get into my body

[Hook]
And that's that shit that I like, like, like, like, like
A man who can open my mind, a man who can open mind
Is it wrong that I really, really, really, really want you?
And there's no need to ask, you feel it too

[Bridge]
Do you, do you, do you feel it?
Do you, do you, do you mean it?
Do you, do you, do you feel it?
Do you, do you

[Verse 2]
So come tonight, run the lights, say your close
Fuck these hoes, I want your time
Tees and sweats, hair's a mess, Netflix's on
Still your eyes are glued to mine
You understand me, and it's all I need

[Hook]
And that's that shit that like, like, like, like, like
A man who can open my mind, a man who can open my mind
Is it wrong that I really, really, really, really want you?
And there's no need to ask, you feel it too

[Verse 3]
Are you here to rescue me?
Are you here to go and get a check with me?
Are you here to pillow talk?
Or are you here to bounce and pull out when this shit get hard?
Are you here to make shit right
Are you here to loan me your chest when I cry at night?
Are you here to set me up, get me hyped, turn around and just leave my life?
I told him that's that shit that I'm used to
Don't blame me for my issues
He know deep inside I really wanna have him
The little things what makes him so attractive
Got him opening and holding doors
Touching me in places like a tourist

[Hook]
That's that shit that I like
A man who can open my mind
That's that shit that I like
A man who can open my mind
