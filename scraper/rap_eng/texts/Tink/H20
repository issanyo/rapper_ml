[Verse 1]
You bring the sun to my yard and
The rain to my garden, and the milk to my carton
I see the horizon, looking in your eyes and
Man, I'm just being honest
You put the count to my steps
Stance to my heart cause it beats through my chest for you
For you, for you
You are the block to my circuit
The change to my pocket
The one that I rock with
Mate to my soul, rock to my roll
Trail that I take when I'm tryna make it back, home
You are the bell to my door
Sweat to my pores
Summer in the box when I'm nailed to the floor
Cone to my ice cream
Chest that I hide in when it's lightning and I'm frightened
You're the Friday to my weekend
My life vest when I'm in the deep end
You are H2O, H2O
Soup to my cold, Film to the roll
Love doesn't fold

[Hook]
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity

[Verse 2]
You put the smile in my cheek bones
You are the one that I need close
You are my clock in the am
Summer time is when we lay in
You're the lace to my shoes
Cup to my booze
One that I call late night when I'm loose
Stars to my sky
Wheels to my ride
Reason that I dropped off every other guy
You're an angel in disguise
Boy you really make me fly
Only man that has my eyes
I just enjoy, your sense of humor
You're like a tumor
You're in my head all day
You rock my world like outer space

[Hook]
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
