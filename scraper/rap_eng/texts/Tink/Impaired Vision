[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
And lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see
And lately it's you, and lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see

[Verse 1: Tink]
You the one I need like church
You the one I want when I'm hurt
You the one I choose to confide in
So it really feels good when we talk, then you dive in
But you ride with me even if the tank's on E
You've peeped everything that the world doesn't see
And that to me means the world
You speak to me like a second language
I'm a fan of you, boy, like you already somebody famous
Me, I love you through the bad, the good, in the hills, in the hood
In the foreign or the sudden, baby, I'm devoted
Keep to your heart, tell me who's the one that hold it?

[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
And lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see
And lately it's you, and lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see

[Verse 2: Tink]
If I'm down on my knees and I'm on my last dime
I would hit you, the world doesn't spin when I'm with you
You know the last man cut me in my heart
So it was clear that I need you on my side like a pistol
Sorry if I'm bugging, this is not for nothing
I'm just dealing with a lot of repercussions
You continue from it
So we met up at the job on that Monday
And I knew we'd fall in love just some day
So we gave it a shot, no gunplay
Rode to the top like a stop on the New York subway
I suit you up just like a tuxedo
Your heart's where I feel most comfortable
It's more than a quick fling

[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
And lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see
And lately it's you, and lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see

[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
And lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see
And lately it's you, and lately it's you
And lately it's you, you are all I see
