Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
This industry so fuckin' fake I don't know what to say
Put in my blood, my sweat, and tears
Now that I'm here
They want my mind, they want my soul
They want my time, they want control
They wanna place me in a box
Look at my rocks, I climbed a lot
So why would you knock me?
I give and they take
Try turnin' me into something I ain't
Sorry but I'm on my way to get right
'Cause I got to make up for two years of my life
And I know what I'm capable of
He just dealin' with his pride
When you met me we were best friends
Now you're switchin' on me for a yes man
I gotta give 'em reality fuck what they talkin' about in 'em blogs
Way that I held it together no matter the weather deserves an applause
You were the one with the plan
Told me to put everything in your hands
Well that was a lesson in hell
You want it get up and go get it yourself

[Hook]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Verse 2]
I grew up wearin' hand-me-downs
And shoes already worn around
People like to laugh at pain
But judgin' off how far I came
I can't complain, I'm extra blessed
I just regret we lost respect
When you was here you used to care
We'd talk it out then dry our tears
Now it's all about a check
I wanna know what happens next
Either you all in
Or I get it regardless now that I'm heartless
All I wanted was to fly with you
Spread my wings like a dove
They hated on me at the bottom
Now I'm up and everybody's showin' love
Life ain't nothin' but a lesson, still studyin' the craft
Mariana in our crib, 100 million dollar fishes in the glass
Thinkin' really different these days
So much left on my to do list
Never trippin' bout the low
Been through this shit and you know I won't fold

[Hook]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Outro]
10 toes down in this shit
I want so much fuckin' more, yeah
Gotta go get it all, all, all, all
Gotta go get it all
