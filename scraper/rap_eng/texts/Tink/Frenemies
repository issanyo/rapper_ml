[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Here we go again, I know all your friends
I can tell they want me, but they gone pretend
I know I ain't perfect, that I won't defend
I say they living single, you gone say I'm going in
You can be my Cinclair, Iâ€™ll be your Overton
No offense, I'm noticing, sometimes you go low as them, phone 'em in
I say fuck 'em, you can tell 'em that I'm saying that
If  they know so much 'bout these niggas, where they man at
I'm like damn that, get your man back
Tell 'em sit down, I can't stand that
Watching Martin got me thinking 'bout yo Pam ass
Always blocking, like where yo tan at?
Yeah...

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Love you for life
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

[Verse 2: Tink]
Hanging with your guys, that's why I'm always put off 'til you're done and that ain't no fair
Boy you got some fuckin' nerve, boy you got some fuckin' nerve
Cause you're mine but you're barely around
Do your guys come before me now
If I'm queen then why do you play
Even that's what they say
But how can you blame them
I'm tryna spend some quiet time, but 2k's all that's on your mind
Said your childish ass ain't gone ever love me
What did I do, what did I do to you...
For you to be this petty
Remember how you left me
(Sy Ari: What did I do, what did I do to them)
It just seems like you neglect me
The only time you're here is when we're sex-sex-ing

[Chorus]
Love you for life
(Tink: Yeah, right!)
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

[Verse 3: Sy Ari]
They not true as us
I keep it true enough
That's why they keep they eye on you because... they not really used to love
That's why they always at that newest club
They do the most, but they ain't doing much

[Verse 4: Tink]
Hypocrite!
Wasn't you just at the strip club
You and all your single friends throwing dubs, rolling blunts
Guess they ain't much different from my friends
So tell me what's your beef with them

[Verse 5: Sy Ari Da Kid]
You know me
You showed me true colors
You owe me
And I'll slide through on y'all crew like skrt
And I got you, but they not cool... to me

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah
