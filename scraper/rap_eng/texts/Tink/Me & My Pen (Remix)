[Intro: Tink]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Brewer]
It starts with a rhyme, it starts in my mind
I send it to the paper then put it on the line
The messenger's my pen, the message is my life
I’m hoping that the message in your heart realigns and you realise that I'm just spitting
I ain't being wise
I’m just being I, being free up on this beat
And I [?]
I've gotta be up on this beat for just some peace of mind
Looking for a decent rhyme
Really I just need some time
But time waits for no man, I know that
I know if I don't keep up with the programme, I'm [?]
I'm someone tryna speak up, I'm trying to travel from my zone into your speaker
On my own fam, alone man
But still I'm managing
Ain't standing still, I ain’t a mannequin
Ain’t standing still until I'm travelling so far that they won’t see me again
But for the moment, it's just me and my pen
Just me and my pen

[Chorus: Nick Brewer & Tink]
Ay, it's me and my pen
I'm writing what I see so I can see it again okay, ay
Oh no
And I don’t even what I'ma write down right now
I'm just hoping it will take me away, ay
Away, away, away
Take me away, ay
Away, away, away
I'm hoping it will take me away, ay
'Cause when I don't know what to say
I find me a page and then it's me and pen

[Post-Chorus: Nick Brewer & Tink]
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
It's just me and my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen

[Verse 2: Tink]
You make me feel comfortable
The only one that lets me talk for hours, so with you I feel empowered
I got a lot to say, you know it's been a long week
When don't nobody want to hear it I come to you and I speak
Let me just vent and get some shit off my chest
I fucked up so many times I don't know what's really left
I'm in a place where only me and my pen will comprehend
I trust in you like a friend, I'm holding you 'til the end
Look, you number two but number one in my life
You give me hope when I'm depressed that this gon' all be alright
You let me create an image with flowers and red ribbons
I pick you up every night just to tell you 'bout how I'm living
You know just how it is with dealing with music biz
I'm struggling on my own just want to be in my zone
No flex, but i hate when we apart like an ex
Cause don't nobody understand you write the pieces to my plan
Let's go

[Chorus: Nick Brewer & Tink]
Ay, it's me and my pen
Me and my pen
I'm writing what I see so I can see it again okay, ay
Oh no
And I don't even what I'ma write down right now
I'm just hoping it will take me away, ay
Away, away, away
Take me away, ay
Away, away, away
I'm hoping it will take me away, ay
'Cause when I don't know what to say
I find me a page and then it's me and pen

[Post-Chorus: Nick Brewer & Tink]
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
It's just me and my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen

[Verse 3: Nick Brewer]
A skinny little nine year-old trying to find a role
Letting my mind evolve, scribbling and writing rhymes when I got home
Though I wasn't alone, just me and my pen in the zone, friend not a foe
What I was writing I was setting in stone
Full of fear but I was letting it go
And I'm telling you so you understand me like you're part of the family
Hand on my heart
Heart on my sleeve
You can't really brand me
I write and remember the nights and the 90's December's
I cry and pretend you're just lighting a fire and no sign of dying like [?] with some trying events but we got through 'em
My pen influenced by everything I was doing, ay
And so you see?
Nothing that you don't believe, you just know it's me
Yeah, I'm writing it all
The highs and the times that I fall
Writing like I'm at school
I'm fine, I'll be fine, and I'm cool with the person the pen paints a picture of
The pen paved the way, put me in a place that I wasn't thinking of
'Cause when it's in the pen it's independent of my preconceived perceptions
I just put it in the sentence and forget it
Then remember when I read it that I meant it
I give my pen all of the credit

[Outro: Tink]
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
My pen, my pen, my pen
