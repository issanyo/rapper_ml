[Hook: Tink & Boogie]
You say, you say, you say, you say anything
Hope you ain't got no plans with no wedding ring
Shits been seeming weird
I mean what's the problem here?

You turned your back, did the same on you
Been acting up, set the stage for you

Tell me you would never break my heart
It's crazy how we quickly fell apart
Catching them feelings, catching them feelings

[Verse 1: Boogie]
Don't tell me you love me, no
Don't cover my eyes when it's raining and tell me its sunny, no
Damn, you the first to my aid and the first one to touch me
What's cool at that bottom? That kush done got rough and it stopped looking up
You thought you was above me
I'm feeling like...
(You should, you should)
Quit playing and come throw that pussy on me
(You should, you should)
Tell your friends to stop lurking and lookin
See you my nevada when I'm tryna' save up
I got nirvana, you gone fuck my faith up
I ain't trying to see your sauna, I've been trying to chill out
Every time I wake up I'm reminded of the drama
You know I ain't trying to Tink about it
Hoo! I make your heart heavy
Wonder if that made you fall faster
But I ain't tryin' to Tink about it
But now you out here fucking with some lame niggas
Knowing you don't want to be about it
Its 'bout time that a nigga told you "choose up"
See I ain't trying to fuck your views up and I ain't gotta tell you too much
Cause you say

[Hook: Tink & Boogie]
You say, you say, you say, you say anything
Hope you ain't got no plans with no wedding ring
Shits been seeming weird
I mean what's the problem here

You turned your back, did the same on you
Been acting up, set the stage for you

Tell me you would never break my heart
It's crazy how we quickly fell apart
Catching them feelings, catching them feelings
