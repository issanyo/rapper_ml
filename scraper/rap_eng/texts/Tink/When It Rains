Drip, drip, drip, drip

When it’s dark outside and my body gets cold
You pull up outside and I know what you want
You see this lightning and thunder, wanna get up under
Underneath my covers, it’s crazy what we do when

(Chorus)
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
Have you calling up your ex baby I need that right now
Have you scrolling through your texts, thinking about how we laid it down
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe

(Verse 1)
Oh you’re just so adequate when it comes down to me
Chase me like a river, now I’m wetter than the stream
On my windowpane write my name up on it
With the weather maintains, it’s gonna be rain till the morning
So shower me with love, baby make it flood
So we won't meant to ever leave, I don’t need no company but you
Baby, let’s get locked up in this room
Are you’re on the way, say you’re on the way right now

(Bridge)
You feeling my body, you making me naughty, I’m doing everything I don’t do
It must be the weather that brought us together cause baby, it just makes me want you
Oh love under me especially when it’s thundering
Said that I was done, but it’s crazy what we do when

(Chorus)
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
Have you calling up your ex baby I need that right now
Have you scrolling through your texts, thinking about how we laid it down
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe

(Verse 2)
Drip, Drip, rain dripping like
Drip, Drip, rain dripping like
We’re in the month of May
It’s puddles where we lay
It’s pouring down, pouring down, pouring down
All over your face babe
But I won’t tell nobody about it
I just wanna hear my body shouting
Like ooh, ooh, ooh
Forecast didn't warn me about you, you, you
No, no, no, no, no

(Bridge)
You feeling my body, you making me naughty, I’m doing everything I don’t do
It must be the weather that brought us together cause baby, it just makes me want you
Oh love under me especially when it’s thundering
Said that I was done, but it’s crazy what we do when

(Chorus)
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
Have you calling up your ex baby I need that right now
Have you scrolling through your texts, thinking about how we laid it down
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
