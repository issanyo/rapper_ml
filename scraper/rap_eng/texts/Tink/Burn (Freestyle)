[Intro]
I don't even wanna talk on this intro
We gon' let this work speak

[Verse 1]
Okay sicker than a nursing home
Put me on a death list
Always going in as if my name is on the guest list
Colder than your ex bitch
Hotter than your next bitch
Way over your head
I guess I'm something like a necklace
Something like tetris
Get the block shaking
My wallet Ruben Studdard
And you niggas Clay Aiken
These bitches they be faking like implants and half smiles
I met this bitch head like a fucking face towel
It gets messy when I step inside the booth
10 bitches on my side and they waiting to get loose
Put the bible on the mic
Cause all I do is speak the truth
And if she wanna push my buttons
Pull her out just like a tooth
I'm viscous like some dread locks
I think these hoes got me twisted
Find yourself coming up short just like a midget
Run with me or get left
And it's too late for your decision
Now you up inside the hole
And I'm feeling like Blake Griffin
Score!
These niggas want some more
The rappers can't knock me
Like a house with no doors
My house is one floor
So I'm always on the top
And I run this rap game
Sponsor me with Nike socks
It's the home of the Soxs
And my team is up to bat
You don't need no GPS
To know my city on the map
And it's still fingers up
To all of those who don't agree
She say I ain't got no manners
So I told her "bitch please"
I'm a monster
Sammy
Niggas can't fan me
Cause I be in the booth
Going hard for my family
I need that
Need that
Mama say we "need that"
No I do not stutter
But you know I'm bout to repeat that
I need that deal
I'm popping just like a pill
I'm going in for the kill
Then if you wanna be real
I got these hoes on lock
These niggas lie down too
So when she say she the best
Just ask that ho for some proof
That shit is dead
Lyrically I'm killing these rappers
When they gon' stop comparing me to these actors
Rapping about a life that you really not about
You a sorry ass baby
Get this curly hand out
So she can shut up
I'm really starting to get fed up
But I refuse to just let up
And bitch that's straight up
Let that shit burn

[Outro]
Yo
Who the fuck you know gon' do it like that?
Tink
I ain't got nothin' else to say
You know who you is
