[Hook - Lyriq]
We should have a threesome, me plus you
And I promise I can keep up, I got the juice
Folk bad as hell and they want the same thing, ain't got to choose
I'm so happy I go both ways, don't know what to do
I break it down, down, break it down
Work it out, out, work it out

[Verse 1 - Lyriq]
While I'm in her from the back, make sure she don't fall
Don't trip I'm coming for you next and I can watch ya'll
Ain't too many things that i ain't done
Only touch a soul when I'm in love
That is double the trouble, and triple the fun
And I don't mind, cause two is better than one

[Hook - Lyriq]
We should have a threesome, me plus you
And I promise I can keep up, I got the juice
Folk bad as hell and they want the same thing, ain't got to choose
I'm so happy I go both ways, don't know what to do
I break it down, down, break it down
Work it out, out, work it out
Break it down, down, work it out, out

[Verse 2 - Tink]
So what you think this is, you want menages and shit
You wanna lay back and just watch, while I'm massaging this bitch
You wanna catch us both in action, and make a tape and get famous
You wanna see her tongue do things, well call that shit body language
Well break that down and roll that up cause I just can't be sober
And if she bad then you're in luck like a four leaf clover
I might consider it, know when you fucking with me
Sex is like a drug and tonight that's a session for three

[Bridge - Tink]
So we gone give your body what it's wanting
You better tell nobody how we wet it
Reaching for my spot, oh shit you breaking it down

[Hook - Lyriq]
We should have a threesome, me plus you
And I promise I can keep up, I got the juice
Folk bad as hell and they want the same thing, ain't got to choose
I'm so happy I go both ways, don't know what to do
I break it down, down, break it down
Work it out, out, work it out
Break it down, down, work it out, out
