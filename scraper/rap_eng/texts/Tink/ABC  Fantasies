[Verse]
A is for Aaron, he always running my errands
And when I tell him to hurry, he know to make me come quick
B is for Brendon he's got a fetish for spending
So when he bought me that Beemer, I took a ride on that dick
C is Calvin, he got a whole lot of talent
Say he grew up in the islands, know how to roll with his tongue
D is for Dylan, he doesn't stop 'till I feel it
That's why I call him policeman, he come around and I run
E is for Eric, he love when I share it
Let's talk about Frankie, I love when he spank me, you what I'm on
G is for Gerald, I met him through Herald
The I is for Ian, I can't deny he make me cry when he eat it
I got a lot of y'all niggas in my phone
Can't forget the J for Jerome
He kissed me so soft and he own his own loft
Drunk a little bit of wine, then he got it from behind
K is for Kevin, we caught it quits in '07
I had my eyes upon Larry, we even thought to get married
But that was dead, I'd rather lay with Michael instead
N is for Nicholas, love to send me freaky picks
Can't fuck wit Osiris , he's the type that's into leaking shit
P is for Prestin, I cheated on him with Quintin
But I left that boy by his lonely when I found out they was homie's
You know the R is for Rico, we got one hella of a dino
The S is for Sean, that boy can go 'till it's dawn
You know the T for Tyron, like having sex on the phone
Until I called on Ulises, decide to cook and do dishes
Serve me up like a servant, that reminds me of Vernon
Got a stack like his daddy, said I'd be rich if he had me
I think he wanna have my daughter
To bad I'm waiting on this pretty nigga that I know named Walter
He likes to get x-rated more than in Xavier
Never asked why till I felt it in my pancrea
But can nobody top Zackary, no discrimination, all races running after me
All races running after me
All races running after me
