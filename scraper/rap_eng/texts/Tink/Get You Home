[Intro]
Think of all the things

[Chorus]
We connected, sun's going down and I'm desperate
Think of all the things we could do, once I put hands on you
I just wanna get you home, I just wanna get you home
I just wanna get you home, I just wanna get you home
When I get you off, do me in the car
When I get you off, pullin' on my bra
When I get you off, sex drive through the roof
When I get you off

[Verse 1]
He's a boss and he knows that I like him, is it wrong if I only one night him?
Take him home just to see what the sex like, once we're done he gon beg for a next time
Cool like a chola, I can teach you different things like your tutor
Have you gone off that feeling, hit me when you walking up to my building
Baby I'ma please you, ain't no doubt about it
I'ma get on top and, ride you like a stallion
Feeling on your chest, kissing on ya well
I knew you was ready cause as I soon as you were here

[Chorus]
We connected, sun's going down and I'm desperate
Think of all the things we could do, do
Get you home, I just wanna get you home
I just wanna get you home, I just wanna get you home
When I get you off, do me in the car
When I get you off, pullin' on my bra
When I get you off, sex drive through the roof
When I get you off

[Verse 2]
I'm gon do what you say like you Simon, feel it deep up in my ooh when you dive in
Take it from the bed to the sofa, I perform now you sleep in a coma
Boy you my favorite, you should know that this feels like a paycheck
Throw me on the wall like a painter, money long as an acre
But that don't even matter, now I wanna focus
You can get it wet like you swimming in the ocean
I'm just on a wave and you better not drown
I know what you want cause as soon as you lay down

[Chorus]
We connected, sun's going down and I'm desperate
Think of all the things we could do, once I put hands on you
I just wanna get you home, I just wanna get you home
I just wanna get you home, I just wanna get you home
When I get you off, do me in the car
When I get you off, pullin' on my bra
When I get you off, sex drive through the roof
When I get you off

[Outro]
When I get you off, when I get you off
When I get you off, when I get you off
