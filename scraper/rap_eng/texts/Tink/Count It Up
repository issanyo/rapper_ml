[Verse 1]
Last year around this time we was waking up in the apartment
Convos about condos on a lakefront with our blunts rolled
And we knew that we would make it, spoke it like a language
20 bills, no record deal, and this shit already famous
I had to get up and get it, ain't took a break in a minute
Too busy making a profit, bitches ain't even a topic
Can't count how many times they overlooked me
If only they knew what it took me

[Chorus]
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up

[Verse 2]
I remember when they doubt me, couldn't see me on the list
Now I go to any city club when only paying for the trip
Spending weeks at the sophie, spent a lot up on a rollie
It's feeling like my time, it's feeling like my time
Hate on your life when it's good, Squeak in the back with a wood
Money been goin' around, ain't no more holdin' me down
No, no, no, noâ€”oooo

[Chorus]
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up

[Verse 3]
I had to get up and get it, ain't took a break in a minute
Too busy making a profit, bitches ain't even a topic
So please don't act like you know me
If only you knew what it took me

[Ad-Libs]
You can never understand
Till you walked in my shoes you won't never understand
You know

[Verse 4]
Long talks on my flight home and I'm thinkin' 'how can I make it back?'
Harlems all on my shoulders now and my niggas sayin' I'm too relaxed
Mama trippin', my daddy vision been goin' blind and I'm so behind
I just met up with another nigga cause another woman ran off with mine
Still going through a lot, still tryna get it right
Still thinkin' for whatever reason 'how did I get set up with this life?'
Tell the bookie 'how we lookin'?', couple commas, that's a go
Dedication, being patient, something they could never know

[Ad-Libs]
I'm not even doing it for the credit
I'm doing it for the family now
You gotta eat
R&B to the motherfuckin' streets
(Go,) I'm wid it

[Chorus]
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Long days, long nights, 30 days, 30 flights, count it up
Count it up, count it up
