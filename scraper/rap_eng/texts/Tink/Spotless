[Verse 1: Sasha Go Hard]
Go hard, yeah
Yeah

Bad lil bitch, got tats on my tits
Ice on my wrist, shit cold like Brisk
Shoes lowkey, you ain't seen these kicks
Stack for a verse, get smacked for a diss
Bad lil bitch, got tats on my tits
Ice on my wrist, shit cold like Brisk
Shoes lowkey, you ain't seen these kicks
Stack for a verse, get smacked for a diss

Name another bitch do it hard like this
Do it hard from the start
Get bread for this shit
My nigga, he trip, but I love that dick
Treat a nigga real quick and I love that shit
Name another bitch do it hard like this
Do it hard from the start
Get bread for this shit
My nigga, he trip, but I love that dick
Treat a nigga real quick and I love that shit

No mud, I'm the shit (no mud, I'm the shit)
Got bread, no sticks (got bread, no sticks)
No mud, I'm the shit (I am)
Got bread, no stick

Bad lil bitch, got tats on my tits
Ice on my wrist, shit cold like Brisk
Shoes lowkey, you ain't seen these kicks
Stack for a verse, get smacked for a diss

[Hook: Kitty]
Spotless
[?], can't nobody top this
They frontin' cause I'm stuntin' on 'em, baby, got shit
Cause I'm spotless, yeah I'm spotless
Spotless, spotless, spotless
[?], got shit, these bitches ain't got shit
On me cause I'm spotless
Spotless, spotless, spotless

[Verse 2: Tink]
Sick as a patient, I'll be your temptation
I make you better like all decorations
Cause he's into parties and overnight clubbing
That's half of the reason I don't want a husband
I'm out gettin' money, he's out gettin' drunk
Why when I eat, it's a table for one
Cause when you get buzzed, you just calling me wantin'
When bitches pick up, I know what's to be done
Ima switch lanes on the e-way
Make him look back like a replay
Find me some new shit, hit it like a pool stick
Put that boy to sleep, call 'em PJ
And I bet I give my ex nigga nightmares
New bitch couldn't see me in a high chair
Hype beast that might be the only real chick that can hit a few high keys and still be gutta
Never get another
I'm self made like I never had a mother
Never had help, so I don't need yours
Still get to it like a list full of chores
List full of niggas who just want my attention
These hoes late, write 'em off a detention
Off with your top
If you ain't got guap, then my nigga you a stain
And my nigga I'm spot-spotless
