[Verse 1]
Looked in the mirror
I don't what I see
Lots of regrets
I can't call this beauty
It's just Cover Girl magazine
Flippin through the lip gloss
Kiss ya face, walk away then you wipe it off

[Hook]
We're fading
Like the blue jeans she had on, on
Yeah we're fading like the blue jeans
On this floor, floor

[Verse 2]
These aren't mine
I don't wear a size 9
But I'll be wearing some suits
When I finish it, this time I'll go bang bang
For you then I'll go bang bang to her too
Oh, no homo but I'll give it to you both
Leave my bouquets
When I'm done

[Hook]
Cause we're fading like the blue jeans
She had on, on
Yeah we're fading
Like the blue jeans on the floor, floor
