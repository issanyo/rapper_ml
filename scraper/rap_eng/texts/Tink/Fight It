[Verse 1]
Please, don't break my heart
I just wanna lay in your arms
Yeah lemme put my love on you
Oh lemme tell you what I'm gone do
Need somebody, can't deny it, I won't fight it no
And i'll be honest, I can't hide it
Boy I like it slow
Promise I won't hold nothing back
I think that it's time, time

[Bridge]
It's time we stop playing
You hear what I'm saying
It's time we cut the bullshit out
Lets keep it real
Both of us are feening
And right about now we need it
It's time we got to force it out
Lets keep it real
So, if you feel the same as me
No doubt, feeling like this could be a dream
Round for rounds, don't say no, when I mean yes
You got me bugging out

Cause I don't wanna front no more
Baby I can't say no
When you get me weak yeah

[Verse 2]
Please, don't break my heart
You're the best I'd ever had so far
Oh, they ain't got nothing on you
Oh, baby tell me what you gone do
Show me a love and kiss and cuddle, lets be in love

What we're doing, we don't have to rush
Promise not to lose my direction
