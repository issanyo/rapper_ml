[Verse 1]
You wasn't there when I was alone
Say that you care, but really you don't
It's all in your actions, none of my fault
'Cause I ain't the kind you put to the side whenever you want
There must be something to hide
Feel like when you're on my line there's someone around and stay in the cut, ooh oh
So do me a favor, show me the paper
I'm not in the mood to cry anymore
That ain't the vibe that I'm going for
Thought you were cool
All of it's fake
Told you before that money and girls ain't never replaced
All that I gave you
All that I am
You're just a boy that can't be a man

[Pre-Chorus]
You're spending time away all night
I need you here on my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my name

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling, I'm feeling a way
Yeah, yeah
Why all a sudden you change?
Nothing with you is the same
I don't know how to explain
All we ever do is fuss
Ain't no way to make this up
You're acting different (Hmm, hmm)
So different (Hmm, hmm)
Different (Hmm, hmm)
So different (Hmm, hmm)

[Verse 2]
What did I say?
Or what did I do?
You can't even talk or look in my eyes when I'm in the room
So why would you act like, this was our home?
Dealing with girls who cannot compare to nothing I'm on
I'm feeling so disrespected
I cannot even accept it
Youâ€™re  so out of line for wasting my time, and
Now you're neglectin'
Wildin' out in public
You just love to switch up the subject
I'm so tired of you flippin' and fumblin'
Say I'm trippin' on you over nothing
But, look at yourself
You're doing me bad
It's all in your tone
You hang up the phone and never call back
What do I do?
Start up a fight?
I hate to be wrong
I knew all along that this wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
You're spending time away all night
I need you here on my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my name

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I'm feeling, I'm feeling a way
Yeah, yeah
Why all a sudden you change?
Nothing with you is the same
I don't know how to explain
All we ever do is fuss
Ain't no way to make this up
You're acting different (Hmm, hmm)
So different (Hmm, hmm)
Different (Hmm, hmm)
So different (Hmm, hmm)
