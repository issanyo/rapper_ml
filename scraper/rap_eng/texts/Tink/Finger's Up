[Intro]
Fingers up
Don't give a fuck
They know what's up
When I put them fingers up
Fingers up
Don't give a fuck
They know what's up

[Hook 2x]
I know
That these niggas kind of fake
Why these bitches all in my face
When they know I don't Parlay
They know
I'm so used to going H.A.M
I don't really give a damn
Put your fingers up

[Verse 1:Tink]
Okay, hands up with a middle finger
Let 'em know I don't give a fuck
I heard I got a little competition
Therefore she ain't big enough
Big enough
Yo' money ain't
I'm serving hoes
No dinner plates
I'm out here doing my damn thing
So they honor me
I'm like a holiday
Memorials cuz' it's R.I.P
Niggas soft like Warren B
Bitches mad cuz' I'm hitting notes
Now they man calling me Tink G
Tink G but I stay sharp
I keep a bag like a shopping cart
All these haters up on my dick
That condom size about a extra large
T-size like knee highs
I'm coming up and they mad about it
Flexin' on bitches I'm taking they niggas
I drop a few bars now get it shawty
Oops I ain't mean to do that
I'm a beast and I might hurt feelings
But a bitch got to know that I could care less
Middle fingers up to the ceiling

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Tink]
I ain't tryna Parlay
Fuck we need to talk for
I'm just tryna get paid
Call that green shit Rondo
Call these rappers Ceily
All they life they been sneak dissing
A lot of hoes want to be me
So all your life you be reminiscing
Fingers up but it's four missing
Fuck you like a naughty Christian
Tell 'em to get they praise on
Get up on your knees speaking tongues
Speaking in tongues I be spitting this shit that be having these weak bitches ready to quit
Probably the reason why bitches be hating and waiting to comment on all of my shit
Get real
MTV
Two headed dog
Yea that's me
Yes I'm a savage
Bitches need practice
You ain't running shit like two left feet
Oops I ain't mean to say that
I'm a beast and I might break spirits
But a bitch got to know that I could care less
Turn fingers up 'till she hear it

[Hook]
