[Intro: Tink]
Flexin' on these niggas, man I see you dawg
Flexin’ on these niggas, man I see you dawg
Had to lick him up and down
Just like a card off
Aah, Tink G
Let's go

[Chorus: Tink]
I like niggas in Tru
I like niggas in Timbs
He ain't getting no money
Then I ain't speaking to him
He got black in his heart
You can't do what he does
Let me see what u drivin'
Let me see what u drivin'
(repeat)

[Verse 1: Tink]
Yo flexin' on these niggas
Man I see you dawg
Had to lick him up and down
Just like a card off
No pelle, pelle
That nigga rockin' Burberry
Fuck niggas ain't rockin' with em'
They whinin' like Mary Mary
Them bitches since yesterday
You sweeter than Fanny May
I'm blowing, you niggas soft
They pussies, lets give em shame
I'm moving into a cave
I'm beastin' on every track
It ain't nothing
Bitch I'm pop
My pockets ain't ever flat (haah)
Speeding cause I can, I'm a rapper now
You hoes a mess
I'll rip you up just like a paper towel
Just like a problem child
All my bitches bad tho
Probably why these niggas thirsty, ya'll been on that shower flow
Peeping on his money shit
Heard you had a foreign whip
All our paper go to waste
Getting’ thick up in the hips
Big deal, walk around like I own the place
Own place with his own car
Buy his own shit, it ain’t nothin’ fake

[Chorus: Tink]
(repeat twice)

[Verse 2: Edai]
I like to ride my bitch
I tell her ride my dick
She got the best head, hands down
506
I like to break down bricks
I tell her lay down stiff
Give her dough, she be traffickin’
She take round trips, yeah
She a stomp a ho, that A- town shit
She swagged, and them other hoes they ain’t no shit
But if she act up, I’ma have to switch like chef
Or she could blow my brains
Do you get my drift? Yet
I think she like cause the rims on my car
I say I’m feelin’ you ma, but we ain’t gettin’ that far
It’s like I’m workin’ fast, exercise and getting’ that body
And I’m a young dread head, hair lookin’ like Marley
Yeah, she say she like a nigga
In that Tru Religion
And believe a nigga, like a superstition
She cook, clean, fuck, and she do the dishes
She’ll play that role, like some movie bitches

[Chorus: Tink]
I like niggas in Tru
I like niggas in Timbs
He ain't getting no money
Then I ain't speaking to him
He got black in his heart
You can't do what he does
Let me see what u drivin'
Let me see what u drivin'
(repeat)
