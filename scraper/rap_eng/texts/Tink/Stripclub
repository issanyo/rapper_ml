Drop it, drop it, drop it

[Hook]
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more
Stripclub (yeah-yeah)
Now she living at the stripclub

[Verse 1]
Grew up living in Chicago
Never had love from her father
All she really needed was attention (attention), attention (attention)
Nineteen had a little baby
Dropped out of school just to raise it
Mama said you wanna be grown your on your own
But now she's at red diamond, every weekend she's shinning
Trying to make ends for the kid (no-no, no-no, yeah-yeah)
Paying for tuition with her body
Popping "X" pills in the lobby
Don't wanna remember what she did
What she did that night oh-no

[Hook]
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more
Stripclub (yeah-yeah)
Now she living at the stripclub (club)

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody judge you no, no
Make that money don't let that money make you girl
She's climbing up thinking of all the things she could have done else
But whats to do when no one cares and all you have is yourself (ohhh)

[Hook]
20 years old, and she ain't got time to play
Baby daddy gone, money getting low
Mama won't let her stay no more
Stripclub (yeah-yeah)
Now she living at the stripclub (oh no, no, no)

[Outro]
They don't know your story
They don't know your story, no

They don't know who you do it for
Drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it (stripclub)
Drop it, drop it, drop it
Ooo no, ooo no, ooo no, ooo no, ooo no
Living at the stripclub
That's some real nigga shit right there (real shit right there)
