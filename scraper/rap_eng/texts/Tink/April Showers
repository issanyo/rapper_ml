[Verse 1]
Midday in April, don't you feel the shower
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Standing at the bus stop, it's been about an hour, yeah
But I ain't mad, cause you were there
And I ain't mad, bout' my hair
It's just you and me in the the pouring rain
So comfort me
Come on, come on baby
I don't wanna feel nothing but you
In these April showers

[Verse 2]
Midday in April, don't you feel the shower
Yeah, yeah, yay-e-yeah
Gave me his jacket, he got manners
And I ain't mad, cause you were there
And I really don't give a damn, gone and let them stare, baby
It's just you and me, in the pouring rain
So comfort me, come on, come on baby
I don't wanna feel nothing but you
In these April showers

[Bridge]
And when the nights turn gray
I know you'll be right by my side
Holding me tight

[Outro]
So comfort me, I don't wanna feel nothing, nothing, nothing, but you, yeah

April showers..
