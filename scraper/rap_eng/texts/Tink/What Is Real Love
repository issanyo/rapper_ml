[Verse 1]
Don't you hate it when you finally get a man and you think that he's the one
He comes into your life, fucks it up, and then it's done
You're really fed up but you're trying not to trip
Till he finds another girl and tags her name in every pic
All so you can see it and get jealous, â€¨I hate them type of niggas
They look out for themselves and never even care about our feelings
I'm scared to fall in love I don't know what that's about
How can one day you be in and then the next day you're just out?
Is love supposed to hurt?
Supposed to ease the pain?
Does it last in the rain? Oh yeah
Will you love me when it's dark?
How can it be real if it's all torn apart?

[Hook]
What is real love? (Love, love, love)
What is real love? (Love, love, love)
What is real love?

[Verse 2]
I wanna fuck with you but you be on some other
Laid up with a bitch that used to fuck on all ya brothers
These hoes ain't got no standards and I thought that you were smarter
She really took you back after everything we said huh?
I need a man on the low
Soon as I tell him no he's on the phone and out the door
Where you go?
How can you be sorry if you don't know what you're sorry for?
How can you be sorry if you don't know what you're sorry for?
Where you at?
You never get it, I'm stressing you like a marriage
Thought that he would stay but he left and I'm so embarrassed
I'm always there to do, when you've given all that you can
I only got one question

[Hook]
What is real love? (Love, love, love)
What is real love? (Love, love, love)
What is real love?
