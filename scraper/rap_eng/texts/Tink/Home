[Verse 1]
I ain't got no time to beat around it
Baby I need someone to settle down with
Call it what you want but let's be steady
I know we're scarred but chances are we're more than ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been single for way too long (too long, too long)
Something's got to give, what am I doing wrong?

[Chorus]
I am trying to find something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home

[Verse 2]
So how much longer you gon' make me wait?
Cause I've been running in and out the state
Perfect time to put your name on it
Let 'em know just where to return it
Moved your ex up out the passenger
I'm not concerned 'bout what you had with her
I'm more concerned about your day at work
And what can I do to not make it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been single for way too long (too long, too long)
Something's got to give, what am I doing wrong?

[Chorus]
I am trying to find something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home
Something I can call home, call home

[Outro]
I've been single for way too long
I've been single for way too long
I've been single for way too long
I've been single for way too long
Long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long
