[Intro]
Battery check your resource
Mya, MyGuy
Whoop, whoop, whoop

[Chorus: Mya]
Don't need money, got my own
I got bags, bags to blow
Hold up boy, I don't need your dough
But you could spend it on me if you want
Don't need money, got my own
I got bags, bags to blow
Nah, nah, boy, don't need dough
But you could spend it if you want

[Verse 1: Mya]
And ya know me, I do the most (the most)
Bank account stay on overflow
Go for broke (go for broke), shut down stores (shut down stores)
Save my own (save my own), I'll spend yours (spend yours) ayy
Gettin' 0's but I don’t mind some more
I got mine but I'll blow all of yours
Boy I do this all day
Hope your money long bae
Mess wit' me the strong way (whoop, whoop, whoop)

[Chorus: Mya]
Don't need money, got my own
I got bags, bags to blow
Hold up boy, I don't need your dough
But you could spend it on me if you want
Don't need money (don't need money), got my own (got my own)
I got bags (I got bags), bags to blow (to blow)
Nah, nah, boy (nah), don't need dough (don't need dough)
But you could spend it (spend it) if you want, ayy

[Verse 2: Tink]
Young and I got my own
Fellas on deck 'cause my body on wo
Waist so small but the bank look big
I could blow mine but I'd rather blow his (his)
Walked in the club, it's a baller alert
Lookin' for a man that can put in that work
Messin' wit' a cheap dude ain't gon' cut it (no)
This ain't the twilight but I been cold-blooded
Blood on my hands, I'm dress to kill
If he wanna kick it wit' me gotta flip the bill
Boy keep calm you are just a crush
Anything that you give me is just a plus
The bag is secure and the bills all paid
If you ain't here to ride then I gotta switch lanes
I deserve everything I desire
Ran through his money then I passed him to Mya

[Verse 3: Mya]
Miss independent, yeah that's me
Yeah I be ouchea gettin' it
Ain't like them others boy, don't ever get it twisted listen
Ain’t nothin' broke, so it ain’t nothin' here to fix
You tryna get it put your money where your mouth is
Go 'head and spend it ay
Spend it, uh, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it

[Chorus: Mya]
Don't need money, got my own
I got bags, bags to blow
Hold up boy, I don't need your dough
But you could spend it on me if you want
Don't need money (don't need money), got my own (got my own)
I got bags (I got bags), bags to blow (to blow)
Nah, nah, boy (nah), don't need dough (don't need dough)
But you could spend it (spend it) if you want (if you want), ayy
