[Verse 1]
I wanna make you my priority
I step it up when you around like a sorority
I was thinking later on we could link up
Bow you like a gift and I’ve been wrapped around your finger
Finger me slow with one hand
Tell 'em you with Tink and we fly as Peter Pan
The Louis or the Gucci you know I can’t decide
He ain’t on house arrest, but I want him inside all day
For me he gonna blow like vapor
He told me that he like his women tall like his paper
He labeled me a queen, no tiara
Say he wanna have a future with me like Ciara
I'm in love with, ya smile
You handle me, around
Physical, some days
But I’m loyal, all the way
You know that I would never try to hurt you

[Hook]
And like I know that you got up your guard
And like I’m dying to be in your heart
And like I want you to know it’s real
And like I know how it feels to be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side
To be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side

[Verse 2]
You think that I’m messing with every nigga that I come in contact with
Ain’t got no problem with telling people that I’m in a relationship
What’s the point of keeping secrets
I give you every code on the low your my soul and I’m all for you
Tell me that’s not true
We shine like the light crew
Do anything we like to
I’m like your shadow cause I’m always behind you
24/7, finally learned my lesson
My love won’t change
I'm in love with, ya smile
You handle me, around
Physical, some days
But I’m loyal, all the way
You know that I would never try to hurt you

[Hook]
And like I know that you got up your guard
And like I’m dying to be in your heart
And like I want you to know it’s real
And like I know how it feels to be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side
To be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side

[Bridge]
Bring it to me first you're jumping back to conclusions
It's never what you’re thinking I hate it when you assuming
Being with your fam I follow up with ya mama
You the only one that can hit it like a piñata
Got some dinner for you, I left it up in the stove
Not inside a movie but baby I play my role
Don’t worry bout no others I told you it was covered
You won’t admit it now, but we’re something like lovers
And I’m aware that some things take time
Baby I know how it is on your side

[Hook]
And like I know that you got up your guard
And like I’m dying to be in your heart
And like I want you to know it’s real
And like I know how it feels to be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side
To be on your side
Your side
Your side
Your side
