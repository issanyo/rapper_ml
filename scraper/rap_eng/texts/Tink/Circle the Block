[Intro: Tink & Timbaland]
What's up Timbo, you headed to this money?
Yeah, I be working
Talk some business with me, what's going on, man, how 2016 feeling?
What you mean how it's feeling? It's feeling great. It's feeling, like, it's feeling epic to me
In other words, we finna kill these niggas, basically
Basically, you are right. We are about to crush these niggas and feel these niggas the new wave

[Verse 1: Tink]
7 years since Mike died what a better time to go pop a hoe
Any nigga wanna run game put the dot up on him like a domino
No Dominic's but I bag niggas like mama duty with the similac
Soccer van with a hit man and his aim better than the quarterbacks
Quarter cost me like 7 grams bitches failing like bad exams
Niggas scoring for the fucking team and we will pinch your face like it's Maybelline
And I'm hands on with this dirty work
Sleep a nigga anesthetic
Off top if I see the opps then I'm rushing at them like a paramedic
Parasailing when I'm out of town
Dogs with me no Charlie Brown
Biting hoes getting exposed cause they couldn't make it with their own sound
You the middle man and I am the plug
Right now fuck a next up
Rap niggas keep sneakdissing like Ted Ginn they gon' catch one
Pear nigga can't come here light him up like he Time Square
Kick him out like I'm Gucci Mane, Timbaland and Tink in that tinted Range
And it's hot
Circle the block
I'm from the city where niggas get dropped for being the cops
We high as hell and it's YSL just dripping sauce Dex
And I love a man who can understand how to give me head with no sex
Cause them bands on me like a wedding ring and these hundreds bluer than BB King
And this money coming like vamanos so I can't relate to you common hoes no shade
Damn no shade

[Verse 2: Tink]
Ok, Tim told me no violence
But they want more so I go to war and I never needed no alliance
These bars harder than prison gates I will take you out like a dinner date
No dinner date but she's nervous cause her main nigga's observing
Still counting up old money my hitta moving that snow bunny
We a small team holding big beams got to watch a nigga when they buddy buddy
Sidebar where the champagne toasting up to my campaign
You know getting paid is that J-O-B and my niggas busting like KOD so don't do it

[Outro: Tink & Timbaland]
Don't do it don't do it
You gotta let niggas know sometimes just be cool hmm
Yea the new wave and they gon have to keep up one way or the other Tim
Anyone can get it
You damn right and so you know what I mean by that so anyone can get it
Let's go get them
You gotta go get them let's go get them
What we waiting on?
Nothing
