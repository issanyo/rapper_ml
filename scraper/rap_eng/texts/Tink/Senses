[Verse 1: Mack Wilds]
Bend it over, back it on me like a tow truck
Tryna spread ya legs apart like a toe touch
Just keep fuckin’ me, hugging me, loving me
Giving me something I need
And no she ain’t no stripper
But she on this pole e’r night
I hit that pussy and get higher than a flight
Whoooo, whooo, whoooo, whoooo, whooooooo

[B-Section: Mack Wilds]
See, she gon' spin on it like a DJ
Taking off her panties on the freeway
Can’t wait, can’t wait
Can’t wait, can’t wait no more
Baby, we’ll be there in twenty
Hold on, take it slow for me
Ooh, you got a body on you
Oh, if there could only be two…

[Chorus: Tink]
I wanna touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream
Wanna touch, taste, and smell
Hear you scream
Touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream like, ahhhh… ohhh ahhhh…
(I wanna see you do it)

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
When your senses come alive
You gon' feel this deep inside
When you mix that w/ the swag
The result is you coming quick… quick like…
In and out, treat you like a robbery
All I wanna see is you on top of me
Just fuckin’ me, sucking me
Giving a nigga that something I need…

[B-Section: Mack Wilds]
She gon' spin on it like a DJ
Taking off her panties on the freeway
Can’t wait, can’t wait
Can’t wait, can’t wait no more
Baby, we’ll be there in twenty
Hold on, take it slow for me
You ain’t gotta loan this shit
You ain’t never had it like this, have you?

[Chorus: Tink]
I wanna touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream
Wanna touch, taste, and smell
Hear you scream
Touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream like, ahhhh… ohhh ahhhh…
(I wanna see you do it)

[Breakdown]

[Chorus: Tink]
I wanna touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream
Wanna touch, taste, and smell
Hear you scream
Touch, taste, smell
Hear you scream like, ahhhh… ohhh ahhhh…
(I wanna see you do it)
