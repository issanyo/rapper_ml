Say what's on your mind, tell me you're mine
Need you a chick in your life, let me get in your life
You've hiding stress, let me pull you up
Watch while I undress, let me show you some

I know you wanna hit that
Tell your bitch 50 feet she can get back, right
I'm trying to seduce you
I got a couple hundred way I can use you, right
You pull up in that whip all black, with a bitch in the back
But she wanna come through? Fuck that
Know you wanna touch that
I be waiting up in the room number 302

Two cups of tequila get your mind on
(mind on)
I can't be, be faithful when we're not alone
(not alone)
Physical attraction, I ain't gotta tax him
You know what he want when he ready
You been going steady with the girl of your dreams
But the girl in your bed ain't shit like me
So meet me in my room, put your cellphone off
Searching for the one, baby you look lost
So when you wanna play, I can be your jerk
Like I came from the bay
Say that you in love but the love ain't real
Cause if you was in love, you wouldn't wanna feel
All of my body

Say what's on your mind, tell me you're mine
Need you a chick in yourlife, let me get in your life
You've been having stress, let me pull you up
Watch while I undress, let me show you some

I know you wanna hit that
Tell your bitch 50 feet she can get back, right
I'm trying to seduce you
I got a couple hundred way I can use you, right
You pull up in that whip all black, with a bitch in the back
But she wanna come through? Fuck that
Know you wanna touch that
I be waiting up in the room number 302

You make me feel like an addict(addict)
Just tell me when I can have it
I need your presence, I need you here
Right about eleven, going on twelve
Just ring my bell and if she asks, don't give her details, got it
One on one, it'll be fine, you belong to me
Don't feel bad, it'll be fun, just come and stay
Take another shot, make you feel right
When it's wrong that you're not, face that truth
What you wanna do
You ain't gotta answer 302

Wanna meet me there, baby, wanna meet me there?
Wanna meet me there, make you say (ohhhhh)

Say what's on your mind, tell me you're mine
Need some chick in your life, let me get in your life
Cause you've having stress, let me pull you up
Watch while I undress, let me show you some

I know you wanna hit that
Tell your bitch 50 feet she can get back, right
I'm trying to seduce you
I got a couple hundred way I can use you, right
You pull up in that whip all black, with a bitch in the back
But she wanna come through? Fuck that
Know you wanna touch that
I be waiting up in the room number 302
