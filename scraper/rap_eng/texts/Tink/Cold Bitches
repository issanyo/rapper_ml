Cold bitches
We some cold bitches
Who the fuck you know spittin' hard then all these niggas
Scared to get up on the track
Cause they know I got that crack
All these rap niggas is wack
Im gon' bring the game back (x2)

[Verse 1]
Bring it back, like I said "Hut,Hut"
Niggas in the field can pick my cotton
Cause if they end up on they knees, and I put em to the side
Ima star, nigga you're just robin
Bat mobile, black on black with a hint of that crack
I spit it
Ima savage in the game
All the rap niggas lame
So they minus well just be livin'
A1, I be going in like a tampon
Game full of marks, no scantron
These niggas all talk like a Samsung
Galaxy im high as fuck
My Salary? It's even higher then that
Niggas tryna' keep up with my word play
I minus well get my words tapped
Minus well put these niggas in a skirt
Minus well finish up school to be a nurse
Cause im to sick and they can't compete
If these niggas hard, then im concrete
I got hella bars, state police
Niggas sweeter then the lips on Jolie
I drop one verse let a nigga rehearse
If a nigga walking around with a pussy like me (yea)

[Bridge]
Damn Tink
You stay fuckin' up my man
Dang you raw as hell
Like why you be going so hard?
Man these niggas ain't got nothin' on you
Can I get yo' autograph?
Please Tink you raw as hell, oh my god

[Verse 2]
Anything he could do, I could do it much better
A bitch just tryna' get signed, [?] of a long love letter
And P.S I been a beast
Since 09, yall been deceased
Loving you niggas, im takin' your shine
Better double up on that wave grease
(Ahhh) Im funny right?
A nigga better get his money right
Broke niggas get no love, yall niggas been living that single life
Me? I'm living it large
Sitting on top, of a city called mars
Got more traffic then a lot full of cars
More ambition then the sky full of stars
Homie it's real, who gon' touch me?
What we blowin' on, [?]
I get more views then a crime scene
Not to mention im 17
17? you damn right
Air Jordan, im takin' flight
Yall went left, And I went right
So im on top
Im like a satelite cause im gone

[Bridge 2]
DANGGGGG, You heard that shit?
She said some shit about a satelite
Oh my god
Do it again Tink man, do it again please man
Ain't no- man ain't nobody messing with you
I dont care what nobody say, you soo raw

[Hook]
