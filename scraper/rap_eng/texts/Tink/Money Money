[Hook: Tink]
Rule #1 man you gotta get your money
Rule #2 find a way to keep it coming
Rule #3 never ever trust a nigga
These niggas don't be real
Give a fuck bout how you feel

[Chorus: Tink]
All I know is get my money, money
Daddy told me get that money, money
I'm only in it for the money, money
My daddy told me get that money, money
Money, Money

[Verse 1: Tink]
Yup
I will never give a fuck bout what you think
Say my name been ringing bells
So I just know you heard of Tink
I'm that rapper slash singer
I'm your baby mama's ringer
I'm that bitch that made a hit
Just off the strength of middle fingers
I can rap about this money
But you know how bitches babble
And if they say money talks
Then I got more words then a game of scrabble
See I been smoking on them palm trees
More brick with my palmny
Broke niggas better get it right
Like a pop quiz yall didn't read
And money make the world go round
So I can't fuck with squares
Got to the top so fucking fast
You bitches took the stairs
I took the fast route
You underground, asphalt
I'm underground, but over paid
Don't make me lay your ass off

[Hook: Tink]
Rule #1 man you gotta get your money
Rule #2 find a way to keep it coming
Rule #3 never ever trust a nigga
These niggas don't be real
Give a fuck bout how you feel

[Chorus: Tink]

[Verse 2: Mikey Dollaz]
All I need is money
I don't care about the bitches
Either make it doing music
Or I rap until I'm rich
I need gram
I need mula
And my son need some kicks
Won't waste a dime on a thot
Cause I get paid for the dick
Call me trifling or hard
But don't never call me broke
Money flowing just like water
I give the thirsty bitches hope
See em' counting too much money
I'm a get a nigga ho
Try to play me for my mula
I'ma get a nigga smoked
Rule #1 gotta hustle with my money and a duffel
Rule #2 find a bitch who with the shits to make it double
Rule #3 never trust a bitch, a nigga who don't know you
#4 you will never go broke if I owe you

[Hook: Tink]

[Chorus: Tink]
All I know is get my money, money
Daddy told me get that money, money
I'm only in it for the money, money
My daddy told me get that money, money
Money, Money
