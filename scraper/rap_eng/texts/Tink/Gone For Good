[Verse 1]
Silly me how could I ever be so stupid
To believe all the lies that you've told me
I was runnin' around acting all so clueless when all of the hints were in front of me

[Pre-Hook]
But you knew, you knew that I was so deep in love with you
You knew, you knew that I would be back in a day or two

[Hook]
But noo noo more I'm not coming back this time
And noo noo more I've officially made up my mind
I'm gone gone gone for good
I'm gone gone gone for good

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've said this a thousand times baby
But I've never been this good in my life baby
You've hurt me in my heart so bad and I don't think I'll ever be so bad

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you knew that I was so deep in love with you
And you knew, yeahh, that I would be back in a day or two, yeahh

[Hook]
But noo noo more I'm not coming back this time
And noo noo more I've officially made up in my mind
I'm gone gone gone for good
I'm gone gone gone for good

[Verse 3]
Imma miss your touch, and the way we love
I'm gonna miss your kiss, and everything we've did ooh yeaah
Ooohh wooaahh

Noo noo noo noo noo I've officially made up in my mind
