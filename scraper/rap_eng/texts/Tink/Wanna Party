[Chorus x2: Tink]
Don't you wanna party
Put some liquor in your body
Fuck this club, let's get drunk
Why you talking to me?

[Verse: Tink]
Let's go stupid, where's my music
Hit that dance like you wanna abuse it
Don't say shit when I'm in my zone
Mix that shit with a little Patr√≥n
Little more turn up, even with a boner
Baby you a dog, let me make that owner
Meet my friends and let's make plans
And let's get fucked up while we can, right?
Cause these bitches ain't loud enough
And these niggas ain't throwing shit
Family coupe in the back of the club
And you best believe that I'm pouring shit
Feel that up in your chest
Bitch you better move like a fucking reflex
I'm a wild out like I'm strapped in a vest
And if you want some you can be my guest
Be my guest, I'm not impressed
Now put that rookie ass nigga in a dress
Cause he ain't on much and I'm too important
These here pumps, you can hardly afford them
Don't waste my time, or waste my drink
Out my mind, and I can't think
I'm fucked up in this club so why you talking to me?

[Chorus x4]

[Verse]

[Chorus: x3]
