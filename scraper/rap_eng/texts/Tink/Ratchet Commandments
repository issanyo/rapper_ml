[Intro]
What's up Tim?
Going in right here
Uh

[Verse 1]
I been at this thing for years, it's done turned me to an animal
Some of y'all ratchet, I'm a write you hoes a manual
Step by step, G shit for you to keep
This the ratchet commandments, I need a moment to preach
(Thou shalt not) fuck up on a nigga
When you know he got a missus, you are labeled, side bitches
(Thou shalt not) lie upon the bible
How you looking for a title when you sleeping with his rivals?
(Thou shalt not) put trust in these men
These niggas are now bitches, quit acting so feminine
(Thou shalt not) pacify the truth
If you know your pussy loose, you a ho, so do better

[Chorus]
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man
(Ratchet)
Man, y'all can't sit with us
(Ratchet)
Ha, ha, ha, listen while I preach, church

[Verse 2]
These bitches ain't really friends, she probably gon' take her man
I'm done with the phony hoes, these bitches is really bugs
They rather be on the block than taking care of the crib
I'd rather be making money than taking care of some kids
(Thou shalt not) slip up on a heathen
Always keep it cool, never let him know you need him
(Thou shalt not) let a nigga see you sweat
Fuck a bitch and get the check, move along, you know the rest
(Thou shalt not) respond to these bitches
They envy what you doing and they only want attention
(Thou shalt not) pacify the truth
If you know your rent due, get the fuck out the club

[Chorus]
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man
(Ratchet)
Man, y'all can't sit with us
(Ratchet)
Ha, ha, ha, listen while I preach, church

[Verse 3]
I told Tim like, I'm irritated, devastated
I thought, I thought we had some young queens, what you mean?
We act belligerent, generation of ignorance
Bitches live for the 'Gram so they life ain't got no significance
Boy this shit be a trip like Expedia
She won't pick up a book but she'll probably bust it open for social media
Man, you'd be surprised, cuffing and loving and fucking the team
Getting by just by living and making it work on they knees
Let's not debate it, these bitches is overrated
They probably will never learn cause they lacking in home training, yo
But niggas lying on they money like every day
And niggas ratchet too, just in another way
You fake fathers never held your daughters, never had a conversation
You too fucking immature to get an occupation

[Chorus]
(Ratchet)
Every night doing the most up on Instagram
(Ratchet)
Ooh, maybe that's the reason why bitches, they can't keep a man
(Ratchet)
Man, y'all can't sit with us
(Ratchet)
Ha, ha, ha, listen while I preach, church

[Outro]
(Thou shalt not)
No, no, no, no
(Thou shalt not)
No, no, no, no
(Thou shalt not)
No, no, no, no
(Thou shalt not)
No, no
Cut it, cut it
