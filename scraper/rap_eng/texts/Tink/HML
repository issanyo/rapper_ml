[Hook]
Whenever you want it, want it, want it
You can come and get it, get it, get it
Whenever you want it, want it, want it
You just dial my digits, digits, digits

[Verse 1]
See, I never fell in love before
So don’t mind me cause I’m new to this
Did it happen overnight, I’m not sure
But I feel in my heart every time we kiss
Cause it’s that feeling I can’t put a name on
It’s that feeling, don’t know where you came from
Got my mind gone, tripping over little things
Call me when you make it in, I can’t wait to hear your ring
Tone, I wanna hear your voice when I’m alone
You’ve got me waiting up by my phone
I think I might just be in love
Call me when you make it in, I can’t wait to get your buzz

[Chorus]
Cause I wanna be loved by you
And I wanna be bought by you
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Don’t you ever, don’t you ever
Think that I don’t wanna be bothered, darling
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy

[Verse 2]
I wanna know, what I wanna know is how you feel
All I wanna know, all I wanna know, what’s that deal
When we get a room on the other side of town
I be damned if I miss that call so you know my shit up loud
You’ve got me feeling some type of way, baby
Cause I be cheesing hard every time the thoughts of you cross my mind
Got me caught up on this line, why you gotta be so fine, fine

[Chorus]
Cause I wanna be loved by you
And I wanna be bought by you
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Don’t you ever, don’t you ever
Think that I don’t wanna be bothered, bothered
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy
Just hit my line, won't you hit my line, boy

Want it, want it, you can come and get it, get it
Get it whenever you want it, want it, want it
Boy just dial my digits, digits, yeah
