[Verse 1: Kelela]
I saw you riding ’round just the other day
The sun was out, I felt the rain on me
I know you couldn’t stop just to see the way
I feel like crying out, I don’t know what to say
Now you’re in my room with your eyes on me
I see you tryna talk but all you gotta say
You know sometimes I wish it could go right all night
I hope I wake you up, I hope you change your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Kelela]
Said that I was done but I think I might
Talk in your ear, when you feel it don’t fight
She’s in the room, it'll be alright
Got me feeling naughty

[Chorus: Kelela & Tink]
Your body is telling me “Yes” (Your body is telling me "Yes")
It’ll be hard if we try to resist (It's gonna be hard to resist)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get close)
Got everything that you wanted to see (Thing that you want)
You said you would give me your best (Said you would give me your best)
Is this a love thing or is this a test? (Love me is this just a test?)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get closer to me)
You want it, you want it

[Verse 2: Tink]
So what’s it gonna be? Don’t wanna pressure you
Sing a melody, this what you made me do
You’re irresistible when you’re in my face
Does she satisfy you? Take her place

Steady touching my hand, I look at you
You make me wanna – ah – on you
But we still gotta chill cause your girl’s around

[Pre-Chorus: Kelela]
Said that I was done but I think I might
Talk in your ear, when you feel it don’t fight
She’s in the room, it'll be alright
Got me feeling naughty

[Chorus: Kelela & Tink]
Your body is telling me “Yes” (Your body is telling me "Yes")
It’ll be hard if we try to resist (It's gonna be hard to resist)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get close)
Got everything that you wanted to see (Thing that you want)
You said you would give me your best (Said you would give me your best)
Is this a love thing or is this a test? (Love me is this just a test?)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get closer to me)
You want it, you want it

[Verse 3: Tink]
You’ve been glancing in my eyes, now we talking on the low
His chick’s up in the room but he don’t notice that I know
He been watching me, watching me, how polite when he stuck?
So busy into my presence that he forgot she was there
He wanna touch on my figure and keep me bent out of shape
‘Cause if he rub on my body I might get wet as a lake
I’m talking fuck who you came with, she ain’t gotta know
And if you really ’bout that action, we can film on the floor
I’m drunk, tripping off a nigga who’s involved
I should’ve never tried to get him out his draws
Once again he was pulling on my card
So I shuffled through the club, told him meet me at the car
Come on

[Bridge: Tink & Kelela]
Your body is telling me “Yes” (Your body)
It's gonna be hard to to resist (Oh)
Afraid to get close
Thing that you wanted to see (Thing that you wanted)

You said you would give me your best
Tell me is this just a test?
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me
You want it

[Chorus: Kelela & Tink]
Your body is telling me “Yes” (Your body is telling me "Yes")
It’ll be hard if we try to resist (It's gonna be hard to resist)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get close)
Got everything that you wanted to see (Thing that you want)
You said you would give me your best (Said you would give me your best)
Is this a love thing or is this a test? (Love me is this just a test?)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get closer to me)
You want it, you want it

Your body is telling me “Yes” (Your body is telling me "Yes")
It’ll be hard if we try to resist (It's gonna be hard to resist)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get close)
Got everything that you wanted to see (Thing that you want)
You said you would give me your best (Said you would give me your best)
Is this a love thing or is this a test? (Love me is this just a test?)
Don’t be afraid to get closer to me (Afraid to get closer to me)
You want it, you want it
