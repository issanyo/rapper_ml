[Tha Realest]
Wassup, it's Tha Realest
Sendin this out to my big homey Pac
Lettin the world know that even though I plans on puttin heat down
Got to lay it for a little while homey
Huh, it's still goin down
Still ridin
And even before ya went on ya little mission
Ya left your little homey your blessins
So now I can't do nothin but stand strong

I pray for better days, laid in alleyways
Asked the Lord to help me thru these hard days
I cursed the world in tongues, I guess thy will'll be done
I'm tryin it til the day that I'm gone, can you see me smilin?
Hopin I got my life straight, I can't wait
To meet my saviour at them pearly gates, can't you see me?
My thug style brought me fortune and fame
Didn't deserve to get treated the way I did, baby feel my pain
False accusations make the whole world listen
Stand at ease but please pay attention, all I know
One day, homey that I'ma make it, hard times
But believe me homey I can take it, now stand strong
Jail time gave me a strong mind
Collect my thoughts to help me past my time, ain't no time to cry
Understand this is the way I was raised
That's how it is until the day I touch the grave, now stand strong

[Jewell & Danny Boy]
I feel the happiness
I see the pain, heyehey
You just gotta stand strong
	Youoouaaah
	Whoaaaoawhoa
You just gotta stand strong

[Tha Realest]
Now as the sunshine hits my face I'm thinkin I shouldn't've caught the case
Fast times, the wrong place, now call my lawyer
Tell him, that I need his help and understand
I'm goin for broke so what's left? Call it suicide
Gang ties left me forever scarred
What can I say cos homey times were hard, now bless your soul
We turned on some of the wrong streets
But we were only tryin to make our ends meet, now that we made it
Can't understand the attitudes
The way you were bein treated baby, that shit is rude
Now keep your head up and don't forget to stay in touch
And take ya time to learn this game baby and don't rush
Raise your seed to be a strong man
Because his momma did the best that she can, so ya gotta love her
There's so many to blame when things are wrong
But keep your head up baby and stand strong, heyyyy

[Jewell & Danny Boy]
You got to, you got to
You got, you got, hey hey
You just gotta stand strong
	You, you you you, gotta
	Staaaand, oohyeaheyeah
You just gotta stand strong

[Tha Realest]
Memories that I can never forget, Lord
These handcuffs tightly bruise my wrists and that's no bullshit
See me makin the best out of these situations
So many have died from too much conversation
Inside my heart believe my spirits stand strong
Already knowin that I won't live long, heyyyy
Call me a sacrifice to the world, let me live
And Lord please bless my baby girl
Sometimes I wonder what the hell I coulda been
But I got sidetracked from too much fuckin seein, when will it ever end?
Tell me the secrets to these lost ass questions
Drawin my pistol for motherfuckin protection, now stand strong

[Jewell & Danny Boy, (Tha Realest)]
