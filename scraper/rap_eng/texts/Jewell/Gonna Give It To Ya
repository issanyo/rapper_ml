[Chorus]
Gonna give it to ya, right
Make sure before i'm through, you're feeling real good
Gonna give it to ya, right
There's nothing I won't do to satisfy you

[Jewell]
Bring yourself here, place your head in my lap
Smell this sweet perfume, while I stroke your chocolate back
Boy you better get ready, for a hell of a time
Bet you never had a woman rock ya baby
And leave it on your mind

[Aaron Hall]
You're making me feel so good
With the softness of your touch
Don't you stop, i'm about to get on top
And show you what you brought me in for
You ask me if I can go all day
Come on baby let me show you
I promise you, you come with me, to ecstasy

[Chorus]
Gonna give it to ya, right
Make sure before i'm through, you're feeling real good
Gonna give it to ya, right
There's nothing I won't do to satisfy you

[Jewell]
Take me, show me Aaron Hall
Let me see the nasty man, break me off
Don't be afraid, cause i'm gonna let you in
I'll help you work it baby
Got me singing daddy again

[Aaron Hall]
Give me your hand Jewell
The way you're making me feel
You're making me heal when the bell ring
I'm not gonna stop loving you
I don't care what the hell you do
Hold me tight, never let me go
Baby, baby baby baby baby

[Chorus](till fade)
Gonna give it to ya, right
Make sure before i'm through, you're feeling real good
Gonna give it to ya, right
There's nothing I won't do to satisfy you
