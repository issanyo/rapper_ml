[Intro]
Hey you have money in your pocket cause you're an engineer. I'm tryin' to get paid so quit playin' back there

[Chorus](2x)
Ooh, I have a piece of pie
Pie's real sweet, have a piece of meat
Meat so tough, i'm beggin' for more
It's not deep enough

[Verse 1]
Anything you want from me baby
You can have it
Tell me your dreams and fantasies
Give you crazy magic
Never have to go far
My love is right where you are
And when you look around
I'm there for you

[Chorus](2x)
Ooh, I have a piece of pie
Pie's real sweet, have a piece of meat
Meat so tough, i'm beggin' for more
It's not deep enough

[Verse 2]
You'll soon discover, you ain't gonna find another
To give it this good to you the way I do (I do, I do)
Take care of your needs
A condom sack when your into me
Make me reach for the stars

[Bridge]
If you don't know, which way to go
Then I will show, cause I'm not your average ho
No baby, so get with it, right in it
Until you reach the bottom

[Ad-libs]
It's not deep enough baby
I want it deeper baby
I want you to dig way down deep
And get it deeper, deeper
I want it deeper baby
Go deep, way deep, way deep

[Chorus](4x)
Ooh, I have a piece of pie
Pie's real sweet, have a piece of meat
Meat so tough, i'm beggin' for more
It's not deep enough

[Ad-libs]
I want you to hit the bottom
Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than the cost of living
Deeper than the fact that you're not mine
Deeper baby, deeper baby
Meat's too tough, beggin' for more
'Cause it's not deep enough

[Chorus](Till fade)
Ooh, I have a piece of pie
Pie's real sweet, have a piece of meat
Meat so tough, i'm beggin' for more
It's not deep enough
