Intro: Tha Realest, (Jewell)

(Hohoooow) Comin home y'all, look out for me
(When I'm comin) Y'all don't have to send no more mail
(Owowoohh)
(I am comin) Appreciate all the support and e'rything y'knowImean?
(Ooohoooh) Good lookin out
(And I'm comin) From your big homey, y'nahmean?
(Comin home) Here we come, here we come

[Tha Realest]
Who'd ever figure that they'd finally get me?
It's a cold ass world they way them bastards hit me
Well I will trip and did my time like a real soldier
Didn't get to spend time with my kids as they grew older
Them jealous judges had me waitin to appeal my case
Knowin no way in hell that they'll appeal my case
I left, bowed my head when I walked the yard
And put my mean mug on at them prison guards
They hate to see me cos I had so much authority
And anybody with power had to acknowledge me, and that's no lie
Throwin spreads wit my little homies
I tried to help him with his life because my past haunts me
Inside this world we have so many rules we have to follow
I try my best in this world but all I got was sorrow
Baby I'm comin home

Chorus: Jewell

People get ready
I am comin home
I've been down you know
When I'm comin home
*repeat*

[Tha Realest]
Look at me dressed in my prison blues
Gettin visits from all the ones who kept it true
Understand that behind the walls potna it's a cold ass place
Seein my adversaries take, two shakes to the face
I can't believe the way society turned their back on me
When I was doin so much throughout communities
Come on God, am I that bad?
Do I have to get harassed by coppers and a badge?
Look at em macin me down, I got too much pride to fall to the ground
I made it, Jewell and Death Row is where we're now
It's amazin the way that I've been blessed, I guess
My time in prison was just part of the test
I wonder will it be peace when I'm released to the streets
But for now I'm all alone baby, so I'm comin home

Chorus

[Tha Realest]
Guess what? I made parole today
I had to sift for my homies from the other way, believe me y'all
I had to keep it real y'all
Ain't no holdin me back, homey it's time to go
I'm on the freeway, mashin in my drop-top red Double-R
Everyone's amazed to see this ghetto superstar
Dreams do come true
I make the effort, everyone around me can do what I can do
And that's on P-Funk, tell moms to get a meal ready
Her baby boy's comin home and believe I'm ready
You know what? I realised that I made a mistake
I lost my number one homey, it was a give and a take
I can't wait until my penetentiary dreams are gone
But until then, I'm comin home

Chorus to fade
