[Intro]

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook]

Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'

[Verse]

Yo buck buck shots when I pass the block
Yo the Desert Eagle ran out, so pass the Glock
Time to kick the fuckin' door down, past a knock
I ain't got beef with cops, I just whoop ass a lot
And I get asked to stop, but they don’t understand
That I got my own brand of justice, so I
Take the law into my hands, fuck this
Castrate a rapist, drain him out, bloodless
If you a bully, let’s test out your toughness
I’m Frank Castle, I punish for fun kid, I love this
Furious as fuck, I’m the jury and the judge
And I leave a murder scene lookin' real gory
Beg for your life when I pull the knife, same story
If we on the same side, why the feds lookin' for me?
Vigilante on the beat from Andre
Call me Dexter motherfucker, this is my laboratory

[Hook]

(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep the feds ringin'

[Outro]

Watch your fuckin' step kid
T-e-double-n
With my foot up in your ass
