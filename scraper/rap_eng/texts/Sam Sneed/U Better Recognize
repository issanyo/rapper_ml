[Verse 1: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]
(I heard Sam was going solo)
Hot damn, you didn't know so
Well I can blast fast so freak an I'll type of slow flow
I'm hitting harder than Barry Bonds so check the golden child
Throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild
But trump-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggas proper
Did dirt, dipped West cause I clown coppers (yeah)
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me
Mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that
Was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure
Mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps)
Making dough, eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah)
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
That's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(that's right)
So buck my sound, I put it down for the underground
I got the women cause I'm slamming, jamming
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise
So open your eyes, I think you better recognize

[Hook: Dr. Dre (Sam Sneed)] x2
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize)

[Verse 2: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]
I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops
And mad props cause I ran with hard rocks (yeah)
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?)
Them build up enough Luther by keys
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right)
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7
You can ask my ex-hooker
But now I'm on some new improved shit
Making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate
I flipped the script a long time ago, on the five-o
When I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm)
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggas out the gutter
Now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry
These whack creators, I call 'em imitators (uh yeah)
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplanatory
With the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story
With no disguise, a lot of niggas despise
Because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize

[Hook: Dr. Dre (Sam Sneed)] x2
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize)

[Post-Hook] x2
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Think you better recognize

[Verse 3: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy
So fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggas
Hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick)
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing
It's time to earn truth to the game human being
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine
Cause I'll incline with the mastermind
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose
Cause I'm paying mad dues in this record biz, I don't snooze
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egotistical type of flimflam
I can't be faded Sam-I-am
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers
Cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight
Baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo
Thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thighs
All eyes on the prize, so I think you better recognize

[Hook: Dr. Dre (Sam Sneed)] x4
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
They call him Sam and I (think you better recognize)
