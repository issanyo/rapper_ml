[Intro: Noreaga]
Word up dun
Aight one time... do it like that one time I'm sayin'
No excuses, no excuses

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Yo I started out in Iraq the wrong route
More bitches to doubt, more money to count
Yo my Swiss account, with more cheese amount
Keep piling and still gettin' calls from the island
Still do the things I did when I was wildin'
Tryin' to go from penny loafers, to mink sofas
Spending weeks with dime bitches thats freaks
Body so bangin' I call they're tits Sants
Ass cheeks scream loud like Sam beats
Wanna be under the seats in our streets
Last year around the time this year
If I would have got locked, yo I wouldn't even care
But now I got this rap thing
No more hustlin, at age ten my team played to win
We Sonny Carson nobody understandin'
Yo the black struggle gotta hustle to hustle
And once you get muscle nobody trust you
Tryin' to be like Goldy in the Shaft days
These lasts days comin' up
Yo these little niggas comin' up
Keep they gun tucked, ready to buck
Not thinkin'
Black on black crime yo it's swine you're both stinkin'
Pretty Ake, Imam and Mahdi yo it's Papi, offically
Arab Nazi 2-5-2 we regulate this tune

[Hook: Smoke]
You say you never leave the thugs alone
You wanna be wit Nore or Capone
You say you like the way he holds his chrome
But you will never leave him lonely
You say you like the way that 2-5 shine
You wanna be his wife and push his ride
Stand by his side if he did time
Well shorty you should hold him closely whoa

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Yo I still remember when we first did it
Nobody with it
Label said 2-5 is too thugged out
So although we had to but God wasn't glad to
Wait our turn to boiler now we burn
On the daily done fucked in every telly
We can fly just like R. Kelly
The moon is secondary to the sun
I think I got a son but ain't sure
What's in store God there's more
Shortie said the kid mine, knockin' at my door
Could it be tryin' to be what I can be
Islam me 2-5 the army
Said she about to have my seed, soon to be
It shocked me, thinkin' bout a little me
Eternally I bleed think of the seed
Yo at high speed, I multiply with weed
Now I slow my life down I got time to breathe

[Hook: Smoke]
You say you never leave the thugs alone
You wanna be wit Nore or Capone
You say you like the way he holds his chrome
But you will never leave him lonely
You say you like the way that 2-5 shine
You wanna be his wife and push his ride
Stand by his side if he did time
Well shorty you should hold him closely whoa
You say you never leave the thugs alone
You wanna be wit Nore or Capone
You say you like the way he holds his chrome
But you will never leave him lonely
You say you like the way that 2-5 shine
You wanna be his wife and push his ride
Stand by his side if he did time
Well shorty you should hold him closely whoa

[Outro: Noreaga]
Hold us closely... hold us closely
Word up... yo... yo
A little bit of thugs is all it takes
To make this industry just great
A little bit of thugs is all it takes
To make this industry great
Black shine... black shine
