[Verse 1: Chop]
I been.. Out here Tryna get it nigga
On my knees every night prayin I can see the  bigger picture
On a paper chasing mission Tryna stay up out them systems
1 time for my nigga cause lord knows I miss him
I bought a Choppa cause I was tired of bein dat lil nigga
And Puttin pain on da beat so u can feel it nigga
I kno u hear me but do u really hear it nigga
18 years of living I'm painting pictures nigga
My lil nigga got killed over 2 dollars
I done kicked in niggas doors over 2 dollars
My own homie tried to do me for 2 dollars
Now u understand why I sleep with my 2 revolvers
My own father did me dirty when he  left my mother
And some nights when slept I couldn't  wear no cover
Cause I had nightmares on killing me a mother fucker
Now I wake up to that Stick clutching  on dat sucka

Out here Tryna get it nigga
On my knees every night praying I can see the  bigger picture

[Verse 2: Chop]
Strapped tight wit da bible on da dash nigga
Riden wit a M16 and some cash nigga
Cop tried to book me talkin bout a pass nigga
I stuck my middle finger den laughed at the nigga
My own homies turning snaker by the day nigga
So I cut em lose  not much dat I can say nigga
My ex left me man dat hurt was insane nigga
But that was god saying  get back to dis cake nigga

And if his mama scream u could split ha fuckin wig
And fuck his girl to u can traumatized his kid
