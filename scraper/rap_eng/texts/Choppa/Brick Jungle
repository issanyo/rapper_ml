(*talking*)
Yeeeeah, it's bout to go down in this bitch
Represent, represent, represent, represent

[Chorus - 2x]
That brick jungle, known as Marrero
That brick jungle, known as Marrero
That brick jungle, known as Marrero
Harvey and the jungle, pass the tunnel then you through bitch

[Choppa]
Everybody gather round, cause I got some'ing to say
My name is Choppa who serve em proper, represent no other way
Nigga I ain't new to this here nigga, I been true to this here
Represent Marrero when I clock dineros, I was raised to do this here
Choppa look at me folk, now you know that I'm ready to buck
Don't handcuff her, cause your girl she be bucking with us
We send you out dog, the same way we brought you in
I'm from Morerro the brick jungle, so please tell a friend
Now everybody wants see me, coming down they block
Now I remember, when you wasn't fucking with the Chop
Came out of nowhere, and put the whole South on lock
Marrero to me, like California to 2Pac
We got it locked dog, you know we are not smoking philly's
Represent Marrero project, down to Silver Lilly
We in the Platinum club, posted like it's our block
Ya'll know my pedigree, Choppa until the chest off

[Chorus - 2x]
[Choppa]
Marrero's my home, that's where I was raised up
Big Rap my dog, that's where he ate the game up
Now don't get me wrong, cause I was born in Harvey
Where some million dollar niggas, will leave ya sorry
They told me that the rap game, was so swell
And yo it's even swelling up, just ask Money or Mel
Now since Choppa dropped the cd, locally scanning
A hundred thousand copies, now you know that I'm dropping again
In Marrero you ride, or get rolled on
Steal or get stole on, slip up then so long
Same ol' song was number one, for three months long
But guess what, it's hot and it still be running strong
I represent my set, like Jigga and Mossy
If them hoes come to the jungle, we gonna toss em
If you riding through the project, you know that's costly
Any windows that we got, we tint em in dark pimp come on

[Chorus - 2x]
[Choppa]
Cruising down the street, whoo-whoo real slow
What the fuck are they yelling, (Marrero) talk to me now
If you wanna know, how my city get down
If you went to club James, then you know how we clown
Don't throw your sets up, if you ain't round my way
This ain't the NFL, you won't get a instant replay
From the Villas to the Chateau, to the back of the Ang's
Aydevil 'Rero projects, representing the same
Lincoln Shaw, Sattleward to the Villa G. Ames
Westminster, yeah they quick to get rid of ya
And yeah, them boys ain't feeling ya
From Jackson town LBP, to the Lilly yeah we killing ya
So represent, what we bout this year
Marrero gon' stand up, cause we bout this here
And all my niggas in the club, pop a bottle of Mo'
Throw your sets up, and represent for Marrero come on

[Chorus - 2x]
(*talking*)
Yeeeah, that's how it goes down in my city
If you don't know where Marrero at, when you pass the Superdome up
Get off on Ames exit I'm telling ya, we getting real for this year here
This Choppa Style representing off top, that's my home
Off top, I'm representing for that Westbank ya know
But we gon' do it like this here, ya'll keep teasing Marrero
Ya'll tal'n bout where Marrero at, we country boys
Man we riding on dubs too, ya understand
Cause I'm telling ya, you don't wan' play with us
