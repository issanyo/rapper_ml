If your baby momma taken a cup(you dirty dirty)
If you showin' gold teeth when you talk(you dirty dirty)
Say what?(you dirty dirty)say what?(you dirty dirty)

Verse 1
Now I'm a dirty old south boy
And you can tell by the way I spit it out my mouth boy
I'm gumbo funk hot and spicy with a clout boy
A west bank representin' is what i'm bout boy i'm bout boy
You can catch me ridin down on your block on dub deuces
Right through that magnolias where they love

Chorus-2

Verse 2
Now I'm a dirty old south boy
And I know you know that I bought it from the bootleggers I bought it from the store

It's a low down dirty shame
Yal shouldn't of ever let lil Choppa step up in the game

Why all you niggas that's runnin them same bitches that you f**ked last year
Got them hoes on ice like them bitches were beer
Gettin mad 'cause it's niggas like me she will serve me
Hatin on choppa style now you know that's dirty
