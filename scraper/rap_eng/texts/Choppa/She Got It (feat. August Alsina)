Uhh I like it like that
She workin that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move it slow motion for me
(Repeat)

You know you killing in that skirt huh
Know I'm gon put it in your life til you tell me that it hurt huh
Its hard to hear you speak up huh
Want me to slow it down
Cause you ain't keepin up huh
Ima dick thrower
Her neck and her back hurtin
Know it
That's one thing for certain
I'm a young niggah
I'm a subtle pussy killa
Fuck them otha niggas
Guarantee you I'm mula

Hit ya one time
You gon be talkin for days
Texting me and thinking bout me
Then gon buy me some J's hey
I got her hooked now she can't quit
I can call her anytime and she get here quick

Fuck that
I'm gon speed it up
Smack it flip it rub it down
B-b-beat it up
Now she looking at me like damn
This niggah ain't playing
All this pipe game I'm laying
I ain't braggin I'm just sayin
Oh
She fucked up from the jump
She love the way I hit it hard from 12 to early in the mornin
Now she feeling me strong
She say she want it again
And she got a surprise
Cause she bringing a friend
I like how that Victoria secret sit up in that ass
Let me put some more Hennessey in yo glass
Would I be violating
If I grab me a hand full
I know I was dizuum
All I want is a sample
