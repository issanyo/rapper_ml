We gone take it to the Body
We gone take it to the Head
We bust a bitch head
We bust a bitch head
We gone take it to the Body
We gone take it to the Head

[Magic]
I done made a deal with the devil
So you don't wanna touch me
Pussy, you lucky that things don't get ugly
My daddy always told me catch a nigga from the blind
Knock his ass off
Express whats on my mind
Ain't nothing about me phony
My nigga I'll keep it real with ya
Jump stupid and Body Head gone deal with you
Both of your jaws swollen like the measles
The only man can save you is Jesus
I'll say a prayer for ya
For I despose of ya
I'll take your hoes from ya
I'll brake your nose for ya
I'm the sickest, I'm suicidal
So don't get me excited
The roof ain't on fire
But bet cha I'll get it lighted

[Choppa]
First of all most I ain't coming for no foolishness
You better question round and ask somebody who you're fooling with
You making an ass out of me like the same possibility
Of you winning the power ball lottery
You gotta be outta your mind to even start
I'll Chop your dam pork with out a knife and a fork
You niggas oughta wait, polish your skills up for another day
Cuz I'm the biggest shark in this park and you just another bait
Choppa that name ringing in your brain
From the Body to the Head and we bringing niggas pain
Street Ballas ballin in the streets behind the chain
So don't make us up them thangs and get to sprayin'

[Hook]

[RJJ]
If breads gettin broke then I'm breaking it with my peeps
Body Head bangers we're taking over the streets
You couldn't get us no tighter with pliers
Nothin but womanizers so bitches despise us
Pensacola I'm a rep it to death cuz I'm a Florida boy
Nothing more nothing less
You disrespect or test what I say
It's Body to the Head til shit go my way
I'm a gutta boy with a bunch of gutta ways
Gutta mentality but the gutta got me paid
You had your chance we about to pop
Big bread take lil bread like it or not...nigga
