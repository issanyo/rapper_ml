[J-Kwon]
Track boys, whoa whoa
You heard the name J-Kwon, whoa whoa
Yea you'll see me in a minute, whoa whoa
Petey Pablo, whoa whoa
We gettin XXX'D man, whoa whoa
Ebony eyes, whoa whoa
Y'all ready, whoa whoa

I'ma run while gettin front, jus cause you gettin none
Hit a cop then hit a nun, it's all wit a gun
What is done is what is done, it's all for the fun
Somebody said I cut off their head its already done
Yo I'm black wit many straps
I'm put in many masks
Wit a bat my clipped on I'm bangin wit that
Whurr its at is whurr its at
Don't worry 'bout that
You a solider where a soldier relate to that
Now I'm marchin down the alley eatin Rally's
How many motherfuckers that try we need a tally
Now we bluntin there mind and then we outy
Rowdy they step on the bomb the pump outy
Doubt me I'll start the shootin up in the alley
Track one here I'll give a bomb to your family
Meet your family then they start to get calm see
But yo I'ma doin any way what

[Chorus]
You can take it thurr, we can handle that
You can take it thurr, we can handle that
You can take it thurr, we can handle that
You can take it thurr, we can handle that
West coast get XXX'D, East coast get XXX'D
Mid—west get XXX'D, down South get XXX'D
West coast get XXX'D, East coast get XXX'D
Mid—west get XXX'D, down South get XXX'D

[Petey Pablo]
Now take a ride as we roll thru the ghetto
But keep your foot on the pedal cause it can get pretty extreme in the ghetto
Triple XXX level no hold bar we got hood capped and lieutenants and project sergeants
Capable of pullin your card'n bombin your car grenades through your windows
This is all I walk take the main road anywhere we go every time we role
Have me transportin guns stashed in the truck flow
Real talk dog I hit real hard one swing knock a motherfucker block slam off
Hit him in the part where he talk from
Now he got a momma cause the wires in the jaw make it hard for him to tell you somethin
The sun ain't down but the storm comin
The best thing for you to do is try to get prepared for it
They find him bread water milk a couple cans of soup
And a place to go just in case you had to move

[Chorus]
[J-Kwon]
Runnin when it comes to the twos, I'm not forgivin the blues
I'll knock another man clean out his shoes
We get to breakin the rules, let's get to takin them jewels
He still trippin I'll turn his ass into dog food
Who got the static huh, who bring the blasting huh
The automatic huh, and let them have it
Chump I'm a savage what, let me show you magic bro
One shot of this I'll turn your ass into sawdust
I know we lawless, I'm talkin all us
When it come handlin business dirty we flawless
See these revolvers, that's why they call us
The same reason the police ain't never caught us
I'm on another level words from a true rebel
I rock bitches and I ain't talkin heavy metal
You just a crumb, and me I'm a Dirt Devil
Let's see whats left as soon as the smoke settle

[Chorus]
