[Intro: Pusha T]
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon

[Bridge]
They owe me some pape, they owe me some pape
They owe me some pape, they owe me some pape
(My mic on?)
I ain't fucking with these niggas, they owe me some pape
Hi kids, I see these wack rappers like braids all in his head
Did exactly as I did
Hi kids, I see these wack rappers like braids all in his head
Did exactly as I did

[Verse 1]
You only here cause your team pull strings like a violin
Ball, hell nah, bitch I ball like your eyelid
[?] keep pressing me, just tryna get them press release
From St. Louis where we say [?] we flip bird, no Sesame Street
On the average I'm with a bad bitch [?]
Pulled up in that black truck and we strapped up, and we extra deep
Hol' up...
Lets get some shit straight for a second
You just getting bread, Push, I've been straight for a second
Niggas say I'm dead, I say I'm too alive
Living "respect my elders" I'm 26 that nigga 35

[Interlude]
You old ass clown, just an old ass now
Let a young nigga shine
Sit your old ass down

[Hook]
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
Why they picking on me, stop picking on me
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass
Pop, pop, pop, pop your ass
They picking on me
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
Why they picking on me, stop picking on me
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass

[Interlude]
Five albums, a hundred songs
And you ain't got no fucking Yeezy
I bet you got some J Kwon
You ain't got no fucking Yeezy?

[Verse 2]
(Paow) I mute you
I bought a whip, color: odd future
Since -04 I had the odd fusia
Nigga time's crucial, you wanna fight? Yeah right
I turn off your light like I'm Future
Lil homie you don't know me, quit fucking with me
Fucking kids wear wigs and fucking with niggas
You The fucking Creator, is you like really creative?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Pusha T said my name, he owe me some pape (owe me some pape)
Odd Future said my name, they owe me some pape (oooooh)
And I don't fuck with [?], they owe me some pape (owe me some pape)
I ain't fucking with these niggas, they owe me some pape
Why they picking on me?
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass
