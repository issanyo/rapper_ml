Trek boys, you heard the name
J-Kwon, you ain't seen me in a minute
Petey Pablo, we're gettin' XXX'd man
Ebony Eyes, y'all ready?
I'ma run while gettin' front
It's 'cuz youre gettin' none
Here the cop, they hit a nun
It's all with a gun
What is done is what is done
It's all for the fun
Somebody said cut off they head
It's already done
Now I'm clap wit mini straps including mini matched
Wit a bat, my clips on, I'm bangin' wit that
Where it's at what it's at, don't worry bout that
Youre a soldier, where a soldier relate to that
Now I'm marching down the ally, in a rally
Some meany motherfuckers they try, we need a tally
Now we, put it in mind and then we outty
Rowdy, they step on a bomb, the bomb outty
Doubt me, I start to shoot up your Denali
Try Kwon, here give a bomb to your family
Met your family in a start that you can't see
But yo I'm gon' do it anyway

Come take a ride as we roll to the ghetto
But keep your feet on the pedal
'Cuz it could get pretty extreme in the ghetto
Triple X level, no holds barred
We got hood cap and lieutenants, and project sergeants
Capable of pullin' your car, bombin' your car
Grenades through your window, this is all our war
Take the main road here where we go, every time we roll
Family transportin', guns stashed in truck flow
Real talk dog, I hit real hard
One swing knock a motherfucker block, slam off
(Slam off)
Hit him in the part where he talk from
Naggin' back to momma 'cuz the wires in his jaw
Make it hard for him to tell you something
(Tell you something)
It's sunny now but the storm comin'
Best thing for you to do is try to get prepared for it
(For it)
Find 'em bread, water, milk, couple cans of soup
And a place to go just in case you have to move

Finally, when it comes to the tools
I'm not forgiving the blues
I'll knock another man clean out his shoes
We get the breakin' the rules
Let's get the takin' his jewels
Sit still, trippin', turn his ass into dog food
Who's got he static?
(Huh)
Better bring the plastic
(Uh)
Better automatic
(Punk)
And let him have it
(Chump)
I'm a savage
(What?)
Let me show you magic
(Bra)
Wish I had this and turn your ass sawdust
Partner we lawless, I'm talkin' all us
When it come to handlin' business, durty we flawless
See these revolvers, thats why they call us
The same reason the police never ain't caught us
I'm on another level
Words from a true rebel
I rock your ass and I ain't talking heavy metal
Youre just a punk and me I'm durt devil
Let's see what's left as soon the the smoke settle
