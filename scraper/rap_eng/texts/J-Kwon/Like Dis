[Intro]
You are now tuned into the smooth sound of Trackboy Music, show you right

[J-Kwon] & (Andy)
Yea, you know who this is
My name J-Kwon
And I got my man, Andy (tighty, whitey, whitey, whitey, whitey, whitey, whitey, whitey)

[J-Kwon & Andy]
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
I'm a true pimp
And I'm a fake Don

[J-Kwon]
Hi, my name Kwon, (what up Kwon?) best friend Andy
All we do is mack on these chicks, and eat candy
Live wit my mammy, for out on my fanny
Get hella drunk, and shadow box wit my granny

[Andy]
Hi, my name Andy, best friend Kwon
He's a true pimp, but I'm a fake Don
I don't drink Dom, Grey Goose, and soda
I got a lotta knowledge, so they call me White Yoda

[J-Kwon]
Me? I'm a hustla, I don't like mustard
When I'm in the bed, I like my donuts custard
Man, you a buster, you faker than hell
My lyrics on fire, dat's that smell

[Andy]
Me? I'm a joka, I play a lotta poka
If I catch ya cheatin like a egg, I'll yolk ya
I just want to flow, check it how I rock this (rock this)
It's a new single (J-Kwon) and Milonakis

[Hook: J-Kwon]
It's like dis y'all
I'm in the club and I do it like diss y'all
My baby mama she discuss on my lack y'all
I'm still a pimp, I'm a certified mack y'all
It's like dat y'all

[Hook: Andy]
It's like dis y'all
I ain't a playa, so I don't drink Cris y'all
I call you wack, cus I came here to diss y'all
All the strippers in the club getting tips y'all
Tips y'all

[Andy]
Peanut butter on my face, cus I got no class (uh huh)
I would steal yo chick, but she got no ass (lets go)
I got a baby mama, but I don't know her name
But really I'm a liar, and I got no game

[J-Kwon]
Well, six hundred on my benz, but I got no gas
Back seat full of chicks, girl put it on glass
One record blue, my record sales cool
My momma said, "boy you should'a kept yo ass at school" (yo, ya momma's right)

[Andy]
That's what you get, for thinkin you da shit
Man forget bout these chicks, we in the club, eatin grits
That's how we do it, sippin on some sizzurp
Roll up to the club, with my rims on the cizzurb

[J-Kwon]
Andy, we off the rocka, we still drinkin vodka
We on the dance floor, kickin it like soccer
Nickname Chewbacca, you know how we rock this
This the new single, (J-Kwon) and Milonakis

[Hook]

[J-Kwon & Andy]
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
Take it to the floor, Andy
Take it to the hood, Kwon
I'm a true pimp
And I'm a fake Don {*2X*}

[Hook]
