Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Hook: J-Kwon & Tila Tequila]
Wattup Tila? Wattup Kwon?
Every chick in the building
And DJ in the building like la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
And I'm like na, na-na-na

[Verse 1: Tila Tequila]
This bitch about to driving in my bucket all around LA
I gots no way, see y'all but that's OK
My window rolled down like every day
About to get some chicken wings, ain't it Sunday?
I got my Vans on but they look real wack
Two up in the front like flip, flap, flap
They talking to me, I'm about to talk back
'Cause I keeps it real, yeah, you gotta love that
Morning Mr. Lisa, where I can get some hoochie?
No, not Gucci, hoochie
One for my sister and one for my brother
Then my auntie called me up so I gots to get another
So my boy Kwon holla'd at me, said what's up
He got the VIP all up in the club
'Cause everybody in the club getting real tipsy
Rather be at home eating Kentucky fried crispy
Where my soda pop?
Where my chicken's at?
Where my pickle at?
What a bitch gotta do around here to get that?
Where my grills at?
Where my hi hat?
Let the base tap
Ra-ta-ta-tap, ta-ta-ta-ta-tap

[Hook: J-Kwon & Tila Tequila]
Wattup Tila? Wattup Kwon?
Every chick in the building
And DJ in the building like la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
And I'm like na, na-na-na
