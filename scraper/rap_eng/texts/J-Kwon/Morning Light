[Intro]
Father, forgive me for I have sinned
You know, we all fall short in the glory of God ya know
But uh, true life is just so hard you know
Espically when you tryin to find a way out
All I need is a sign
Lord, just give me a sign
Can you just, just show me a sign Lord

[Verse 1]
Dig it I dug it, some hate it some love it
Politic in the game, I'm just a puppet for the public
If I, spit it you can quote it
If you, read it then I wrote it
Knew it's dirty in this bitch yall let me in it so I sold it
Niggas pussy (Why?)
Cuz they givin they clothes up
Sayin that they pimpin' but really givin they hoes up
Am I sick, exactly, from takin care of the family
Carry a scar on my nose, that came from my granny
A major player in this game, knew it since day one
Lookin for shit to be the same, nigga keep waitin
I done done, all I can do for the streets
Humble now I'm waitin to see what the streets do for me
Got a child, so I'm like payin support
Still a child, now who the hell payin support
I can slang and bang on St. Louis streets
Better yet keep it grimey till I'm 6 feet deep, come on

[Hook]
We love gettin high to the morning light
We gettin high till the morning light
Gettin high till the morning light
We gettin high like da da da
Gettin high like da da da
Da da da da da da
We gettin high till the morning light
We gettin high till the morning light
Till the mornig light
We gettin high like da da da
We gettin high like da da da
Da da da da da da

[Bridge]
Forgive me father I have sinned on this one
Hail Mary ten times but this ain't the last one
[2x]

[Verse 2]
Feelin strange, cuz deaths upon me
Damn I should of knew man was not gone warn me
Still rappin, while watchin my papers stackin
Tryin to leave coke alone but the streets callin me back in
And I ain't actin, watchin homie subtracting
Check the murder rate I ain't lyin thats a fact and
I'm from a city where they want they corners back
Body bag, toe tag if you don't know how to act
Picture that, niggas straight scrambling for crack
Baby mamas keep up drama but I love where I'm at
If you ain't never been to the Lou this here lyrical too
And if you thinkin bout comin then you best be true come on

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
We nobody until somebody kills you
Gettin high till the morning light
(We gettin high till the morning light)
[2x]
