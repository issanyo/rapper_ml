[Jermaine Dupri Chorus]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Dick ridin thinkin I don't know
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind door

[Jermaine Dupri Bridge]
I wake up, knowin' I'm bout to see em' all in my face
Like what up, these mutha fuckers all over the place
I'm fed up, Homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, wit all that thinkin' you goin take my place

It's alot of niggas in this club popin' bub thats foney
Actin like they got nothing but love for the homie
Straight 2 faced like them niggas at Sony
(now ain't you the mayor)
I'm the one and only
For the longest me and my niggas
Been hittin this town like a storm
And now you gotta see me and Penny arm to arm
One day you'll get it
Keep tryin nigga
Yeah right you ballin, keep tryin nigga
I know alot of ballers
Half of em' hate me
Bankrupt, bitch you must ain't see my moms lately
Be damned if you like me
Give a fuck what you rate me
I only know 2 words
And nigga thats pay me
Now we finna stop talkin shit about J.D
Cuz he been doin' this shit since yall was babies
How you goin' try to degrade me
Yall ain't my friends nigga I ain't crazy

[Jermaine Dupri Chorus]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Dick ridin thinkin I don't know
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind door

[Jermaine Dupri Bridge]
I wake up, knowin' I'm bout to see em' all in my face
Like what up, these mutha fuckers all over the place
I'm fed up, Homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, wit all that thinkin' you goin take my place

[J-kwon]
Now I'm what can chill
Till the moment I lose mine
And when I lose mines
Gun stores gone lose nines
I thought you knew Kwon keep 8 on the waist line
I'm from the Lou
Kwon flip H to waist time
I spit it, for niggas who don't fee my shit
She a whore I don't like her
You can get on my bitch
She want a war, what for I'll peel this bitch
Body lifted gun wit it I don't need this shit
You my enemie
Dressed in my friends clothes
But when I shoot I do better
Than Shaq doin free throws
A bunch of niggas trippin
That got the game wrong
A bunch of niggas fealin like me who bumpin' the same song
I'm evil, why you think you goin take my spot
Waitin till my album drop quit thinkin you pop
And you rappin hard core
When oyu knowin you pop
And you sayin you a realla when you knowin you not

[Jermaine Dupri Chorus]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Dick ridin thinkin I don't know
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind door

[Jermaine Dupri Bridge]
I wake up, knowin' I'm bout to see em' all in my face
Like what up, these mutha fuckers all over the place
I'm fed up, Homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, wit all that thinkin' you goin take my place
