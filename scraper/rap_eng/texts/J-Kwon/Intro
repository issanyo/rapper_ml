My Mic On
My Mic On
Oh Oh My Mic On

Hey yall don't don't you hate when when people waste
A-a good beat on the intro
I mean yea yea i could've brought another bet for my intro
I could've brought another beat for my intro
But but fuck that

I went and spent my money a track board Jung for my chain
I went and spent my money on dubs for Myh regal
And I went and spent my money on a half pounds of that good
So with no further a-due
I would like to introduce myself J-kwon, and welcome to the hood hop album
