Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake id though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me

[Verse 1:]
1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Babygirl a** jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th in the series gotta score
If not i gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do s*** for fun
You ain't got one n**** you betta run
Now i'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down i'm breakin down what i done
She smokin my blunt sayin she ain't havin fun
B**** give it back now you don't get none

[Chorus:]
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy

[Verse 2:]
2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now i'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now i'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can i get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so i'm thinkin that's koo
Bit instead of 1 lifestlye i need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
And she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how i do but i guess why i gotta do

[Chorus:]
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy

[Verse 3:]
3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say i'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
N**** waste it on me man son of a b****
Brushed it all off now i'm back to gettin lit
Grisa orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin cause i'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set kwon cut out them trees
Dude i don't care i'm a p.i.m.p

[Chorus:]
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy

[Outro:]
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
Everybody in this b**** gettin tipsy
