[Intro]
I mean, I just need to talk to you right now
Yeah, yeah, where I begin
Right, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunny day, age 14
When I first saw you, you was lickin a ice cream
Knew you had freak in ya blood from the get go
Yo' you showed a nigga some love from the get go
Cute too, so you ain't get caught in the image
Friends got in I shouldn't of tossed out our business
So religious, yeah
In other words, sorry couldn't explain the way I was feelin
Back to the story - 'member when we used to hit concerts
Mainly legit and Nore's
Tryin to get on that was exciting for me
And exciting for you that was something to see
Plus you had ass and I loved that
Back in this I was ya boyfriend I rubbed that
Tryin to get on, girl I accheived that
Everybody hands out from you I recieved that

[Hook- Sadiyyah]
Don't need no ice and no billie
I just wanna have you here wit me
I'm there for you, always be true
It's just you and me, you and me (I can't promise that)
You don't have to go doubble platinum
I'll be there and I'm always goin' back em'
I'm there for you, always be true
It's just you and me you and me (I can't promise that)

[Verse 2]
So I know just because
How you said them words it had to be love
Basically it had to be us
Against the world not giving two fucks
But know soon as shit picked up
I start actin different so you switched up
I don't blame you, but I blame us
Kept shit smooth even when it got rough
But, I don't see that no more
Got one half our wait hope he sore
What the fuck is hopin' for
When I can't be the man I used to be no more
No time, we don't go out to eat no more
Barely home, you don't see me before you sleep no more
You love me, and I know you ain't playin
Cuz the first week gone, you callin' me sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Business got good, but we got bad
Money got happy, but we got sad
But in the midst we had a daughter
Evern though we floatin' clear like ocean water
Came home two bags of Fendi
It was gone that started to offend me
Child support hit, that really offend me
Puffy was right it's all about the benjie's
Bitter now cuz the loves still in me
In my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy
Thinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy
Then I listen to I got the remedy
After all I still give you what you need, cuz we got a daughter to feed
Though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
Why the fuck did I listen when you told me that stupid

[Hook 2x]

[J-Kwon talkin over music]
You know, you feal my story
Write me or something ya know what I'm sayin
Or I'll be in a town near you or, or
Your town or whatever ya know
Come see me and come tell me that ya know
It's been a long time traveling
Though you was supposed to be here
So uh, ya family can't say I'm wrong
