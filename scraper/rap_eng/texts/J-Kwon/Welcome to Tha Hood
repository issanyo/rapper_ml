Boy fifth cock, derty get rocks (get rocks)
Gee I'll just lean on him (lean on 'em)
Miss business herre then he swing on 'em (swing on 'em)
Problem too big, put the team on 'em (team on 'em)
They still runnin' up, put the beam on 'em (there he go)
I don't give a damn if you don't like me (so what?)
I ain't gon' "Do The Right Thing", I ain't Spike Lee
Spike cyanide in ya ice tea

St. Louis ain't ridin' and they likely (yeah they likely)

Now do you got a gun? (Welcome to the hood)
Got a pocket full of crack? (Welcome to the hood)
Lost your money shootin' craps? (Welcome to the hood)
Have you ever been car jacked? (Welcome to the hood)

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Uncle Charles said the game needs me (needs me)
So I keep the red beam to make the aim easy (easy)
You put me on game like Baby Train Weezy (Weezy)
And all they told me dude pimpin' ain't easy (keep it cool)
Used to pop Big Papa work
Now my diamonds big and blue like Papa Smurf (the little guys)
And dude I'll pop a jerk
And my homie rob his brothers now his pockets hurt (let me get that)
Like Jay I did it my way
I ain't get it for Freestyle Friday
Cardinal curve hand north talk sideways
I got work up and down Kingshighway
Plus dude bring the hood to the rap game (rap game)
Wanna bet? some like a crap game (crap game)
Work a sex, better have my exact change (exact change)
Or I'll run in the boardroom, let it clap mayn
GLACK mayn

Thrid District's who I represent
One of the watches look like a peppermint
Shake your frame is what Salt-N-Pepa meant
Cops can't spray the dude's face wit peppermint (Hey it wasn't me!)
Man cause I put the iron on 'em
+Heavy Starch+, put "Da Hol' 9" on 'em
Heavy spark, now the dirt lyin' on him
Oops my bad, found out they was lyin' on him (oh well)
Got a flat? need a car jack?
Better yet, need a strap cause the car jacked (let me catch him)
TrackBoyz where the stars at
Have you got to the track like Tall Cat? (keep it movin)
But I'll never leave my hood derty
If I fell and got my hood dirty (got my hood dirty)
Even when I get this good thirty
I'mma be in the hood wit a good birdy (a good birdy)
