[Intro]
Ay world, this Streets 101
I'm fin' to give you a half a pound of J-Kwon
And a quarter bird of TrackBoy music

[Hook]
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 1]
This the new improved Hood Hop
I make erry mu'fucker in this bitch do the whop
Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggas run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 2]
Now I wish a nigga would run up like that
When I put that on the hood, I'mma strike back
And niggas talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch ya clique
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
Y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown
I got shit that'll turn ya fuckin' Coupe 'round (*gun cocking*)
You ain't heard? I'm the truth now
Matter fact, hook gon' break it down
Break it down

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 3]
Dogg it's a mystery..
How we drop one single, left the game now the whole world miss me
Freak this bitch like homegirl Missy
Like I'm sellin' liqour, got the whole world "Tipsy"
Sick and tired of old g's tryin' to gip me
So I put a lump in his shit, like a hickey
All I say to them is, "Dude come get me"
Watch 'em catch a crude desire, like a gypsy
Funny how I can't loc in public
Smoke in public, girl even joke in public
Got dough, so that's why I'm so republic
Cops hit the do', I start actin' so republic
I had a set, they actin' like I had a brick or more
So you got snitched on by the carni-whore
Show-Off or show ass what these guns are for
Or let the priest show her mom what these nuns are for

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?
