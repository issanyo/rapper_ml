Uh, Yo...
I Feel Trapped, My Backs Against The Wall
I Sold Crack, I Made Stacks, But Im Destined To Fall
Anyway Yall, The Jail Cell Ain't No Place For Me
Anyway Its Overcrowded Ain't No Space For Me
Court Date No Way, Thats What They Hope To See
Can U Believe They Told Me Wasn't No Hope For Me?
That The Only Thing Out Here Was Dope For Me?
You Might As Well Got A Tree And A Rope For Me, Im Hangin
And I Got So Much Hate Inside
I Done Seen So Much Wrong Dawg My Fate Done Died
But Couldn't Let These Motherf**Ckers Take My Pride
Yeah I Was Hurtin But You Never Seen No Tears In My Eyes
And Everytime Im In These Streets My F**Kin Mom Was Cryin
Cause Of You, Inside, My F**Ckin Mom Was Diein
You Put Crack On These Streets, N**Gas Brains Is Fryin
Im Sick Of Your **It Im Sick Of Your Liein
Sick Of Hearin Bout A War On Drugs To Stop Crack
Nothin But A War On The Thug To Lock Up A Black
We Dont Own No Boats No Planes No Trains None Of That
You Brought It Over Here So Mother F**Ker Send It Back
And You Travel Space Other Planets Lookin For Martians
Kids In Your Own F**Kin Cities Is Starvin
Sendin Money To Feed People In The Third World Countries
Motherf**Cker Sleepin On The Street Dirty And Hungry
Can't Believe The Shit You Do, Know You Wrong
You The Reason Why She Dropped Out Now She Dance In A Thong
You The Reason Why I Spit With So Much Hate In This Song
My 1st Ammendmants Free Speech And B*Tch I Know I Ain't Wrong
You The Reason Whya N*Gga Suffer From Paranoia
Cuz You They Judge, Your Motherf**Kin Brother They Lawer
You Runnin For Office In One State (?)
And Your Brothers The Governor, Coincidence? Naw..
You Call Yourself The Land Of The Free, Home Of The Brave
This Shit Belong To Me Bitch My People Were Slaves
F**K Forty Acres In The Mule Now, I Gotta Tool Now
And Im Just Waitin For One Of You Bitches To Move Now
