[Intro]
That's right, uh...
Recognize real, Ghet-o-Vision, nigga
Cleveland, open up your doors!

[Verse 1: Ray Cash]
I'm in the old school '84 Delta 88
Wit' a ounce, but I'm bouncin' like I'm out here movin' weight
Bone and Biggie in the Pioneer, as I reminisce
Before that it was "D'evils" took 'em back to '96
I went down to Houston for some face, Mary Jane
What a coincidence, I'm blowin' Swishers, doin' the same thing
Six-hundred for some big O's, 400 degrees
I'm a ho, Player's Club, Ice Cube, Master P
And since I'm movin' my yay, know I got UGK
Ridin' dirty, lookin' for that high life, pimp, what more can I say?
I'm just stickin' and movin', under my seat is my tool, and
I keep it for any nigga wanna be trippin' or foolin'
I'm just bumpin' my music as I'm spinnin' the bend
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, "Picture Me Rollin'" without spillin' my Henn'
Yeah... yeah, now as I spin and I bend
I'm bumpin' *Pac*, "Picture Me Rollin'" without spillin' my Henn'

[Chorus]
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear the speakers blow

[Verse 2]
Now back to the '84 big body 2-door
No blades on the muh'fucker but it still roll
Memba' what told you what I had stashed in the dash
Back in the past? Well...now I got two O's
"Freaky Tales," Too $hort, Comin' Out Hard
Doors wide open, kids dancing in the yard
While I'm stuntin' like Evel Knievel man
Bumpin' Cutlass, Monte Carlos and Regals, man
Rollin' in "slow mo", like the whole block screwed
"Lacville ‘79,” bumpin’ Devin the Dude
On the way to the telly, we was bumpin' R. Kelly
And right before I cut her, it was "Confessions" from Usher
She ain't used to a thug, she love the way I ride
While I'm bumpin' "My Life" by Mary J. Blige
See, I damn near cried day Rick James died
See that shit was cold blooded but the music keep bumpin'

[Chorus]
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear the speakers blow

[Interlude: Scarface]
Yeah... Facemob is in the buildin'
I'm in the area
Hey, I like that shit you on, ya dig?
But I got some shit I'mma put you on
I'mma put you on that shit I be on

[Verse 3: Scarface]
It was like FUCK THE POLICE, comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga blowin' big comin' down
A Nigga With the Attitude, Eazy, Ren, Dre, and Cube
Creepin' up the avenue, that's how you had to do
YES... I'm the rhythm, the rebel
Without a cause, never lowerin' my level
I'm on some Chuck D shit from P.E
Six in the mornin', I hustle with Ice-T
Six in the evenin', I'm chillin' wit' Willie D
Leavin' out the nickel, I'm bumpin' some Kool G. Rap
Back to the neighborhood, shoot me some craps
I'm fuckin' wit' that pluck wit' the Kool-Aid pack
And now I got a brother by the name of Warren Lee
Hot shot Regal illegal like Marley
I get down like I'm BDP
Ass blaster like Blastmaster, cock and squeeze

[Chorus]
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow
I'm just bumpin' my music... music... music..
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow
