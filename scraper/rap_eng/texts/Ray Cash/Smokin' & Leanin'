(feat. Tucan)

[Chorus x4:]
What you know about smokin n leanin, tryin to get paid, tryin to get paid, tryin to get paid

[Verse 1:]
Well its your boy Ray Kizzy in the motherfuckin hizzy welcome ya'll to the place to be
I just got back yesterday hopped off the plane from Houston out there with Face and Free
But now I'm back in the city with the bop like ditty came to snatch somethin pretty pimpin hard
I got a call this morning from my nigga in mansfield shout to niggas doin time in the yard
Now I'm sittin here thinkin wishin I was on my mission with my niggas see he gettin down raw
But I said fuck it I get duckets from this rap and sat back and thought about it shit I'm the best by far
I guess what I'm sayin is if this rap ain't workin then I got work pimpin we can get this bitches twerkin have the block
Doin her pussy I mean have it poppin pussy niggas gone get shot down for cock blockin if God's willin to let me see another
Day nigga all I wanna do is get paid
And if a nigga wanna buy then I got folks who supply when you see me nigga fuck with Ray

[Chorus x4]

[Verse 2:]
Well I just can't stop gettin gettin paper I think I'm addicted tryin have my summer whip up on them 24
Inches bitches itchin for me to scratch them kitten cause they see the way I'm livin and my rose gold glow
Chain swangin nuts hangin niggas on them corners slangin swangin to my music when I open up my dough (door)
Action pistol packin got that thang up on my lap before you niggas think you jackin Imma clap and let it blow

[Hook:]
Nigga smoke somethin, smoke somethin, Ray Cash bout that nigga no frontin, Imma act a real for real or pow hold somethin
I'm tryin to stack somethin, I'm tryin to fold somethin

[Chorus x4]
