[Intro: Fabolous]
Young OG
A Boogie, what's up?
Another one
Yeah

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You used to be my baby
Remember when you used to wear my chain and my bracelets
I know you blushin' when I make a statement
So don't you worry 'bout them bitches I don't entertain them
They only want me 'cause I'm famous
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie but just call me baby
And I be rollin' with the gangstas
Mask on, gloves on like they contagious
But what you think about me
Anything I put on I be lookin' ode
Pull up to a party in a 'Rari 88
Goin' 200 it was me and E3
Pray when I decided I'ma go my own way
She all on my body and she hopin' I stay
I guess that's what happens when you run into the C.R.E.A.M
Cash rules everything around me (Cash rules everything around me)
But even when I'm with a new hoe
I still end up thinkin' 'bout you
Because they just don't know
They don't know me like they really want to
And everywhere I go
When I come through all I see is wild thots

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thots
Wild, wild, wild
When I come through all I see is wild thots

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look, let's keep it real and never fake it (fake it)
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, they can't take it, take it, take it (I know)
The vibe is off, I gotta shake it (skrt)
Look, I'm nothin' like them no one to mistake it
The sun is gon' shine even through the shady
Just 'cause I play it Melo, don't think you can trade me
You can't buy class, I bought a new Mercedes
Came back on them birds, I'm the new Tom Brady
Wow, all I see is wild life when I'm out
Bunch of snakes, couple cats with my life in they mouth
Lion like they gorillas really soft as chinchillas
Don't sweat the butterfly after you diss the caterpillar
That's wild
Wild, wild, wild
When I come through all I see is wild thots

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thots
Wild, wild, wild
When I come through all I see is wild thots
