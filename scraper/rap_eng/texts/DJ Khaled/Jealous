[Intro: Chris Brown]
Jealous, jealous
We The Best Music
Ohh, oh, oh
They don't want us together, together
Another one
You need somebody babe, you need somebody babe
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I pick you up in my ride
Make sure you waitin' outside when I pull up
I told my niggas I can't slide (no, no)
Just to be right by your side
I pull up, baby, anywhere
I want you, all to myself
I grab your hips and I
Girl you're the one for me (yup!)
Tell you I got all you need
Cause I want your body (yo body)
All over my body (body)
And I know that they hatin'
They say I'm no good
But I know that they watchin' (no, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I can tell that you need some love in your life
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind
Fuck what they say

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (oh!)
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether

[Instrumental break, supposed Big Sean verse]

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But Girl I can tell that you need some love in your life (oh yeah)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (oh, na, na, na)
Fuck what they say

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous (jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (oh, oh)
Girl they just jealous, jealous, jealous (oh woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (oh woah)

Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit
