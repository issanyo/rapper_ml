[Intro]
Yeah, hold up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, fightin' for the 98, now I'm in that 2 percent
Flashbacks to '02, R. Kelly in the news again
Hopin' it's confusion, I can't afford to lose again
Real life, no Superman, that's why the villains usually win
They just want our soul, so I get home and pop some Luther in
Rappin' on a Sunday, dirty looks from all the Lutherans
Check my net worth, I don't need the network
I'm burnin' holes in my thousand dollar sweatshirt
Turnin' hoes into thousand dollar experts
If you hatin' suck a dick until your neck hurt
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul, but it's too expensive
She said that money was a new religion
Paper multiplyin', we don't do division
I used to ride the bus without a bus pass
Now I tell a bitch to ride the moustache

[Pre-Hook]
Like Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul-

[Hook]
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul, my shit was too expensive
Lately I ain't been myself but you can't tell the difference
Now my shit hittin', I'm the one you missin'
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul, my shit was too expensive
Lately I ain't been myself but you can't tell the difference
Now my shit hittin', (I'm the one you missin')

[Verse 2]
I'm way too old for new love
I'm chasin' new bucks
Plus my heart too cold for Nubuck
You hoes should suit up
Swear this shit is like a new drug
And I'm the new plug
Flow so dope that you could shoot up
Stay low and move up
And my drop shit pop, I'm too clutch
I'm takin' too much
Pull up with that pompon, who been gassin' you up?
Bitch you supposed to hold me down, what's been holdin' you up?
Either way I don't give two fucks, you ain't worth two nuts
Sam told me so much, Diddy told me no rush
No luck, sorry Puff, I'm in Ferraris doin' donuts
This feelin' got me so numb
XO the clique, they won't touch
Yeah MCM can't touch the water he might fuck his gold up
Hold up, there's love inside this styrofoam cup
I been runnin' through your mind and that's what fucked my soul up
Smokin' like I ain't got no lungs, I started so young
College bitches goin' so dumb, suck my dick like no gums

[Pre-Hook]
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul-

[Hook]
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul, my shit was too expensive
Lately I ain't been myself but you can't tell the difference
Now my shit hittin', I'm the one you missin'
She on that Bobby Brown, I'm coppin' new editions
Devil tried to buy my soul, my shit was too expensive
Lately I ain't been myself but you can't tell the difference
Now my shit hittin'
