[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We all got to go through storms
We all got to go through mud
Remember the sunshine on the other side

[Verse 1: John Legend]
First I got to give thanks to the most high
I've been through it all good and bad seen both side
Now we in the sky seem so high
And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie

[Hook: John Legend]
You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just cause we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up)

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Don't worry it won't rain forever
I've been through the craziest weather
The world is cold there ain't no one to call on
I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong

[Hook: John Legend]
You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just cause we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Thak you for all of my blessings
All praise to the most high
The most high
