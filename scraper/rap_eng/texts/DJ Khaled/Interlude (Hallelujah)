[Verse]
Hey, I got the world on my shoulder
For real, I got to stay up on my toes, for real
God bless me, glory, please protect me, glory
Oh, they tried to tempt me, but you never neglect me
I got my hands to the sky screaming glory
Glory, glory Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I prayed that they don't do you
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray glory!
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
