[Intro]
Ayo, it's your boy Mikalott aka Black Noctis aka Light Skinned Goten... Watch this. I done told Y'all I got this

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm here to light the track up, If you slackin, better back up
Got people I once respected that I wouldn't even dap up
Heard that I was good, and I don't even need no backup
Took that into account and hit the lab to get my raps up
Now I'm Showboating solo, Success in my Ojos
So much on my mind, ain't even smiling in my photos
Never been fake, so fake grins I dont wear
I ain't got no chagrin, if I don't win, I don't care
Treat losses and wins like identical twins
I search my mind for these flows and force these syllables in
And that's the only thing I that ever bother to force
Boy, I'm big balling I ain't even out on no courts
When I was hurting, I used to let the liquor run it's course
Now I'm studying up on the inversions of chords
So I can produce my own shit, I'm tryna be self sufficient
I ditched them old habits that made me way less efficient
Used to party all the time, even on the weekdays
Got so deep in the trap I quit working on my screenplay
On the seven deadly sins, that could've set me up for wins
Allowed the people to see it through my personal lens
But the world wasn't ready yet, and I wasn't ready yet
Shit was getting rocky so I had to steady it
Speaking of Rocky, feels like I'm training for the title
Ain't walking round on the proving ground acting entitled
Never been that type of dude, and I ain't hanging 'round em
Used to never focus on the journey, only on the outcome
Though I've switched my ways, you can hear it in my words
I still hate deciding how to close up a verse

Another round? Don't mind If i do
I've always excelled at anything I put my mind to
So when it comes to this rappin I'm labbing to make it happen
I'm mixing raw talent with passion for a reaction
And if a reactions don't happen it's reflective of the formula
So switch it up, or it's obvious you don't even want it Bruh
That's the definition of insanity;
Nothing but pure intentions with all these gifts He has handed me
Even if I'm turning up and embracin' my dark side
A conversation with me will show you where my heart lies
...specially if you digging deep enough
I'm Super Sonic with the Sonics hope y'all are keeping up
Headed for the summit, but they wanna see plummet
It's dog eat dog out here, hunt or be hunted
Already know I'm dope, so the credit's unwanted
And money ain't a thing so I ain't sweating the hundreds
What's money if you got time?
And what's time if you got rhymes?
We all got deep thoughts, I just take the time to jot mine
Cause all the hotlines got em on the Hotlines
Like "Dawg, You got a verse from Mike? I need to go and cop mine"
And this is just the iceberg's tip
I had a lot on my mind but I made the right words fit
