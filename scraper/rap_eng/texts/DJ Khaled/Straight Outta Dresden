[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Verse 1 (Ice Seem):
Straight outta Dresden, crazy young boy named Billy
I been through the war so my mind is real silly
From the US, but in Germany
I pray my own country don't come and murder me
Kurt Vonnegut wrote a book about me
But schools banned it cuz y'all some patsies
Out of my mind, thats how I'm goin out
For all you school boards trynna throw it out
They told you bout the war but the ain't tell you bout this
The meaning of the book is quite easy to miss
Tryna go off on the sex and violence
Sorry, about a war I can’t keep the silence
I gave up the war
Just tried to forget and live some more
Here’s a murder rap just to keep you detached
With this massacre, don't wanna stay attached
Bombs are the tools
While Billy and the soldiers sit around like fools
Billy and his friends go toe to toe but Billy
Don’t care if he racks up the foes
He accepts whatever comes daily
All the horrors of war, just can’t see clearly
That the bombing by the USA
Was shielded from the public everyday
When Billy’s in you better expect crazy
‘Cause Billy’s unstuck in time, mind’s all hazy
As he leaves, believe he’s time travelin’
But when he’s back in reality, he’s straight outta Dresden

Bridge:
(J. Yao) Yo Chey!
(ATG) Wassup?
(J. Yao) Tell em where you're from!

Verse 2 (Alex the Great):
Straight outta Dresden, these crazy young soldiers
More Germans they smoke, their hearts get colder
Billy’s  crazy you oughta know this
Standing still in the face of his foes
But he don’t care, time travelin’ everyday
To an alien planet far away
Place with green creatures called Tralfamadore
Held in a zoo to be trapped even more
Vonnegut uses many themes
Like there's no free will, and the war ain't what it seems
War ain't never good versus bad
Cuz the USA bombing dresden is actually bad
Religion of Christ, stays gettin roasted
But in war God's work is hard to notice
Many of the parents hate his writing
Cuz he writes way too much bout fighting
The book is seen as very unpatriotic
But bombing innocent cities is just psychotic
Vonnegut shows America ain't the greatest
So u school boards gon have to just accept it
Controversial themes are mentioned a lot
It seems too much but it's what the wars got
Cuz WW2 an ugly sight
Religion was lost and soldiers futures weren't bright
No one benefits from war
So if u think this book ain't fire get out the door!
Schools might think this book is crap
But a book with these themes is heat like this rap
Straight outta Dresden
