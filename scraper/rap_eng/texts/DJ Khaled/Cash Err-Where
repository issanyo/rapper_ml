(Intro: Yamine)
Hello, it's Yamine, were back in the studio again and I want you to know this is our best, and will be our best song. Let's get this on

(Verse 1: Yamine)
There's cash err-where, fallin from the sky
It's all the way in the clouds them people think I'm high (yeah bro)
If you want the money, then you gonna get it
If you want the millions then you should go and win it (let's go)
I mean every single dollar you got was worth the minute
You running through the crowds, just for the tippin (yeah)
If-you-keep-on-doing-what-you-gotta-then-you-be-there-waiting -for- that- brand new chicken (hey)
Me, Kev, and Brodecai in the studio again
Waiting for some bad chicks to hop right on in (ayy)
I have the money to take my shawty to a dinner (hey)
Olive Garden, no Ocean Prime, now that's a winner (yeah)
Larry turns up the bass, you know he's in a race (hey)
We all friends that's thinks very differently (UH)
David Hayes and my gang ain't gonna get robbed
If a person run up on us he is gonna get popped (bang)

(Chorus: Yamine)
We got cash everywhere, yeah
All this cash is flowing with the air, yeah
I got money for you girl beware, yeah
Take you out for dinner and pour you a little liquor, yeah
Cash err-where, yeah
I said cash everywhere,yeah
Cash everywhere, yeah
Cash everywhere,  yeah
Oh yeah. yeah, oh yeah

(Verse 2: Yamine)
I got this cash on my lawn
It's like playing chess, but instead I'm the pawn
It's like giving me a test, but now it's with the law
Everything I say is right off my chest, and I'm back like saw
Gucci on my shirt, gucci on pants
All gold and red J's is for me, so they call me the man
Four bands, right in my hand
I walked up in the party and tipped some models right in advanced
I've been rapping, and running
In the studio on budget
The haters act like it's nothing
But wait till I press that button
You know I mean it no stunting
Stop the trappin and gunning
Instead of pulling triggers I'm chasing that money
They call me David I
Cuz I'm one of kind
You want it then you can get it girl
Please don't be shy

(Chorus: Yamine)
We got cash everywhere, yeah
All this cash is flowing with the air, yeah
I got money for you girl beware, yeah
Take you out for dinner and pour you a little liquor, yeah
Cash err-where, yeah
I said cash everywhere,yeah
Cash everywhere, yeah
Cash everywhere,  yeah
Oh yeah. yeah, oh yeah

(Verse 3: Yamine)
Cash with me, no semi
I don't shoot guns, call me Christy
I'm a Minister, I bring the word of God
These people try to mess with me, I left it up with GOD
I love my mom with all my heart, and you know we won't depart
Once this cash is all with me, I will make her mind go spark
I promise one day I will be a rich and wealthy man
I don't need no strippers, But I'll have a wife in my bed
Feed her whatever and help her with meds
Help my children out, keep them away from feds

(Chorus: Yamine)
We got cash everywhere, yeah
All this cash is flowing with the air, yeah
