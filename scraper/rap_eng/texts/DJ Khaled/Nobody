[Intro: DJ Khaled & Nicki Minaj]
We the Best Music!
Another one!
Young Money, Alicia Keys, kyuh!
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can't explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I got something inside of me that can't be quenched
I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Uhh, after they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you (excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive
Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Say nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen (tell 'em baby)
Glory, looking for some glory
From all the trouble I've seen (one more time)
Tell em' nobody knows, all my sorrows
Nobody knows what tomorrow

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
Baby, say it glory
You, I
Can you feel it? Can you see it?
Tell your mama you
