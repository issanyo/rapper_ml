[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Another one
A'yo Nick Grant, sometimes you just gotta say, "Fuck 'em!"
They been hating, so fuck 'em all
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
You must've told her I'm poppin', this bitch blowin' me up
I be burnin' this bread, who let the toaster get stuck?
Got the key to your heart, man who doper than us?
Got the hood on my back but ain't no cobra in us
I hit you with the flex, I hit you with the swoo
Diamonds lie on my chest, still I live in my truth
I give Cupid the cue, simply I got the juice
Twin Benz when I kick it, I feel like Ken and Ryu
I'm the ghost of her past, man, she dyin' to get through
Billie Jean on them hunnids, no they can't fuck my groove
Annie are you okay? Are you okay? I'm smooth
Just because I'm a player don't mean I play by the rules
Tell me what it be like, hit my phone 'cause me, I been the shit
I've been poppin' since red light green light
Give my shooters green light, you so thirsty, dehy'
Oh, another missed call? disconnect from the line
Peace sign

[Chorus: Nick Grant]
Nicky Bomaye, Nicky Bomaye
Bitch, I'm poppin' everyday, drop the top and skrrt
Hunnid dollar make a killa, see it at the way
Fuck the...
Locked away for the [?] way
Boom like Aaliyah, shake the world
Fuck the world
A kill, make-up for your girl
Diamonds chains, fields niggas full of [?]
Hundred dollar bill nigga, I'm that one
Nicky Bomaye

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
I go stupid, my flow foolish, she pop that coochie
Uncle Luke shit, shit is Eazy, the drop is Ruthless
Feel like Yoba, DeLorenzo, they coppin' deuces
Real nigga, keep it funky like Collins, Bootsy
Hallelujah, she brought her friend, that's all inclusive
Jordan flow, Montell 'em just How We Do's It
It's like I'm havin' breakfast with Tony I hang my Cuban
It's like I'm havin' breakfast with Tony I hang my... fuck off
I give 'em hell from where the demons don't sleep
Tryna to throw Lox on my Styles, still I keep it so Sheek
Chef Nicky, hoe, the flow is just who seasoned on beats
All these niggas chances slim, as when the vegan don't eat
I'm a savage dog, take a splash of the sauce
Left my stain on the game, these niggas have to Resolve
These niggas sleep at the wheel, Jada's marriage, my dawg
I took death on a date, I rip the calendars off
I'm home

[Chorus: Nick Grant]
Nicky Bomaye, Nicky Bomaye
Bitch, I'm poppin' everyday, drop the top and skrrt
Hunnid dollar make a killa, see it at the way
Fuck the...
Locked away for the [?] way
Boom like Aaliyah, shake the world
Fuck the world
A kill, make-up for your girl
Diamonds chains, fields niggas full of [?]
Hundred dollar bill nigga, I'm that one
Nicky Bomaye

[Verse 3: Nick Grant]
The flow is murder, who gon' stop the violence?
Yeah, I run this shit bitch, I'm just exercisin'
I'm so upliftin' but fuck the system like tech advisors
Step designer, can't find a word that would best describe 'em
Slapbox with bears and slept with lions, I'm death defyin'
I got my weight up but still I'm tryin' my best to diet
Swag drippin' like wet saliva, could wet some lava
I like 'em dark and her flesh Godiva, I'm blessed revival
Fuck boy, be quiet 'cause we don't need you like S in island
The check deposit, I brought some back up, hoe, check Verizon
They don't walk a straight line, who brought the breathalyzer?
I'm on the flight to LA so much I could rep the Dodgers
Uh, such remarkable flows
Bleached denim on mine, I'm brainwashin' these hoes
I'm a prince with the charm, come lock tongues with your toad
Tell her I'm at the gate, that means we follow the code
I'm home

[Chorus: Nick Grant]
Nicky Bomaye, Nicky Bomaye
Bitch, I'm poppin' everyday, drop the top and skrrt
Hunnid dollar make a killa, see it at the way
Fuck the...
Locked away for the [?] way
Boom like Aaliyah, shake the world
Fuck the world
A kill, make-up for your girl
Diamonds chains, fields niggas full of [?]
Hundred dollar bill nigga, I'm that one
Nicky Bomaye

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Ayo Nick Grant, fuck 'em all'
Fuck it, ain't nothing given, take that shit
They not gon' show you the love you deserve
They not gon' respect you the way you need to be respected
They not gon' do nothing for you, so fuck 'em all
Fuck it
Nick Grant, fuck 'em all
But take this advice from me, don't stop. don't stop (Another one)
Don't ever stop, don't stop, don't ever stop
