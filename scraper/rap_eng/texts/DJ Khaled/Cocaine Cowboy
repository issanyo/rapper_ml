We the best

Let's go

Konvict music
This is? live

[Chorus: Akon]
Watch yourself or get tookout
This world ain't safe
Anyday this might be your last day
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
And the cops on the lookout
Each n every day
Workin with dem snitches
Endin' up another raid
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)

[Verse 1: Akon]
Some stone cold killers
With a pocket full of triggers
Here to terrorize your town boy
Considered to be the realist
Of all the other dealers
He's a cocaine cowboy
See they causin' a lot of havic
In movin a lot of traffic
From the white to the brown boy
N they willin' to get down
Put you up in the crown
Where you can't be found boy
Just so you know they will
Connect that n they won't be disrespected
Movin things by the pound boy
So if you want it you get get it
Just be heading south bound n

[Chorus: Akon]
Watch yourself or get tookout
This world ain't safe
Anyday this might be your last day
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
And the cops on the lookout
Each n every day
Workin with dem snitches
Endin' up another raid
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)

[Verse 2: Akon]
N if your lookin out you might
See em creepin round your way
Steady spreadin it around boy
N before you know it
Whole nieghborhood got j's
Searchin round for that cowboy
They gon get it, it's? waitin
For his share boats rockin by
The docks filled with hundred
Dollar bills bout to be there
Livin right across the water to
His place straight to a cowboy
N unload it on the spot
Pay a couple? just to watch
? keep it movin cause they
Ain't got time on the clock
All it takes is one fuck up
Somebody gets popped

[Chorus: Akon]
Watch yourself or get tookout
This world ain't safe
Anyday this might be your last day
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
And the cops on the lookout
Each n every day
Workin with dem snitches
Endin' up another raid
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
