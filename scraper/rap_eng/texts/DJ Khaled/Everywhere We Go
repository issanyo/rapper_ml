[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We the best! Cool & Dre! Sean P!
Everywhere we go we takin' over!
This is what we does!
We the best!
Listennn!

[Verse 1: Sean P]
I'm back to the street, I'm back with good pine
I can't smell what you on folk but you can smell mine
I can hit a button make the door pop up
If you hit your door it cut that mother fucker stuck
I can do my dance a little bit if you back up
Or get real gangsta show you how we mass up
I'm workin' with some money so I bought my own clang
I lock the block down now they sayin' I'm the man
Now they takin' pictures everytime they get a chance
Most them bitches fans they just wanna dap my hand
Momma always told me stand tall or you fall
There's only two choices be broke or you ball
I told her I'mma ball, yeah I told her I'mma ball
I'm sittin' tall while I ball

[Hook: Dre]
I'm good on any man luther
I be everywhere I got people down in Houston
I got killas in Atlanta all the way to Mississippi
Minnesota out to Cali every hood in every city
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?

[Verse 2: Sean P]
I'm in my candy green machine, smokin' irene
Sippin' on lean, on them yadda lotta means
Pocket full of Xanax cause I like to feel relaxed
And you know I got them mupples if I wanna jump back
Got a whole lotta money, from goin' real hard
Ridin' out with the goose, settin' up shop in the yard
Now we celebratin' partyin' like a rockstar
Drivin' hot rod, fuckin' round with hot broads
Went to shoe boxes to fuckin' with bank cards
Buyin' old schools to switchin' the paint jobs
Now we mounted up, and we lookin' like the mob
Pistol on my lap, so a nigga hard to rob
I ball, yeah I told her I'mma ball
I'm sittin' tall while I ball

[Hook: Dre]
I'm good on any man luther
I be everywhere I got people down in Houston
I got killas in Atlanta all the way to Mississippi
Minnesota out to Cali every hood in every city
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?

[Verse 3: Sean P]
V-12, G5, shawty have you heard of them?
Now I'm gettin' money man I ride around in both of them
Murkin' 'em, yeah shawty you could say I'm workin' 'em
Passport stamped up, Louis luggage hurtin' 'em, I'm ballin'
Fuckin' 'round with cola run and vert and them
Hittin' strokers every Sunday like I'm holdin' service there
Any city that I'm in I promise I'll be noticed there
With the real niggas poppin' bottles blowin' dro in there
I'm ballin'

[Hook: Dre]
I'm good on any man luther
I be everywhere I got people down in Houston
I got killas in Atlanta all the way to Mississippi
Minnesota out to Cali every hood in every city
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
YADA MEAN?
Everywhere we go, we ball
