[Intro: Fousey & DJ Khaled]
Yo Khaled, acting is not working out for me
Can I get on your album maybe?
Absolutely not, don't play yourself
Yeah, hey Bryan (hahaha)

[Chorus]
Rice ain't got no spirit, got no deeper layer
One ghostwriter (1 ghost), one ghost Fortnite player (2 ghosts, 2 ghosts)
One ghost thinker (3 ghosts), one ghost Twitter poster (4 ghosts)
Add it up, that's a RiceGum
Stole everything in his life (uh)

[Verse 1]
The king is back, I look around, it's not the same
They love you first, they diss you next, that's just the game
What rapper lives with his ghostwriter?
Man that's a lame. Rice (Rice)
A character with no character
Man that's a shame (Wooh wooh)
I bought my mom a crib, that's a fact
Bought myself a crib, matter fact
You rentin' where you live
Your whole crew's paying rent to live
That's a fact
So much happened, I've been absent (Clout Gang)
Online spazzin', throwing tantrums
They been lyin' to the youth
Now it's time to tell the truth

[Chorus]
Rice ain't got no spirit, got no deeper layer (yeah)
One ghostwriter (1 ghost), one ghost Fortnite player (2 ghosts, 2 ghosts)
One ghost thinker (3 ghosts), one ghost Twitter poster (4 ghosts)
Add it up, that's a RiceGum
Stole everything in his life (uh)

[Verse 2]
Jake Paul was just slurp juice (slurp, slurp, slurp slurp)
I practically birth you (birth, birth, birth, birth)
When they caught you outside Gucci lacking
Face went redder than my Gucci jacket (Gucci)
Brought her back to Cali with LeBron
KSI and Deji actin' strong (Yeah)
Logan warned me not to let them use me
Tyler Perry put me in his movies
Living fame, I had to let go
Show me the facts
It's what you can prove
It's not what you know
It's The Weeknd, I'm on a roll
Bella Hadid DM'ed me back with an XO

[Chorus]
Rice ain't got no spirit, got no deeper layer (yeah)
One ghostwriter (1 ghost), one ghost Fortnite player (2 ghosts, 2 ghosts)
One ghost thinker (3 ghosts), one ghost Twitter poster (4 ghosts)
Add it up, that's a RiceGum
Stole everything in his life (ooh)

[Outro]
Yeah, it's lil Khara
Hey DJ Khaled, we the best
Ay habibi, you wouldn't sign me the first time
What about now?
Come on baby, put another Arab on the map
