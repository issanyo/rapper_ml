In my mind
I had a plan
To save some money
And be the best
I can…
I can’t stand for greedy Folks…
Or noises Girls

Chorus:
Just we up every morning…
Ready for work
I don’t like lazy Bombs…
Proud of myself
For working so Hard…
Yo’ Friends standing
Round be lazy
In my voice is saying…
Work
Work, work, work


Verse1:
Were I love bout myself…
Is making money
More like p.diddy
And I got a
Master plan to…
Survival in this world
Without no problems…
Awesome my rap status







Verse2:
When I must keep help…
My mom with these bills
Everyday I see the Hood struggle…
All the time
Outcome Yo’ Girls watching out…
The prodigy as me
My sisters and I are…
Unstoppable Team of Three


Verse3:
Were all of the young kids…
Lookup to me as the leader
Dreamer She has live in…
Her mind
And I cruising in…
A Lamborghini huracan
Then I saw a beautiful girl…
At the Mall
And she wants me be…
Her friend
Until the end
