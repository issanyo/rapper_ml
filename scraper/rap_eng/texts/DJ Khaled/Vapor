Can't a young nigga make money any more!?
When are things gonna get better than before?
Tired of driving my mom's piece of shit car!
Tired of looking at things I can't afford!

Automatically, look at me, like I'm poor
Talking white bitches at designers stores
Down Rodeo, see the Bugatti
Taking a bunch of pictures with everybody
Kanye be talking about murcialagos
When I can't even get a fuckin' job at  McDonald's
Got a nigga in Jacks, a nigga in Starbucks
Even though they get a raise I know they feel stuck
Aw chucks, no luck, fuck it your life sucks
Design in your haircut's the way you get em starstruck
And just in case you couldn't see the pattern
Getting money is the only thing that fucking matters

Can't a young nigga make money anymore!?
When are things gonna get better than before?
Why does it seem I keep getting ignored?
Window shopping doesn't cut it anymore
Can't a young nigga make money any more!?
When are things gonna get better than before?
Tired of driving my mom's piece of shit car!
Tired of looking at things I can't afford!

And They wanna say that I'm financially stable
But I don't really know I'm not that good with labels
You talking to a nigga that don't got cable
Really sucks for me  cuz I can't watch the Lakers
I don't wear a necklace
I don't drive a Lexus
I drive my moms Camry and I drive it pretty reckless
Fuck the recession, my wallet is depressin'
All I want is some change in the next election
I'm literally eating pieces of shit for breakfast
Have you ever tasted arroz con leche?
All I keep getting is the same old lecture
All that said let me ask this question

Can't a young nigga make money any more!?
When are things gonna get better than before!?
Tired of driving my mom's piece of shit car!
Tired of looking at things I can't afford!

When I'm walking down the streets
Gotta show me love
When I'm rapping to a beat
Gotta show me love
If I'm up in the club
Gotta show me love
Cuz I heat this shit up like some motherfuckin Vapor-Rub
