[INTRO: THE DAN REIDY]

We the crisp music!
Yeah!

[HOOK: THE DAN REIDY]

Yeah you know you listening to Dan Reidy and Bri, yeah
And to Sargent
He brought the bars, yeah
A little past noon but it’s getting kind of dark, yeah
Kind of dark, yeah
Kind of dark, yeah
And I’m getting sick of all these imitations
Switch the title up to crisp yeah real creative
Still I guess I really can’t deny that
Bri’s the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh-eh-oh
Bri’s the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh-eh-oh

[1st VERSE: BRI CRISP]

Ooh!
Who that that I hearing think it’s me
(Me!)
I be at your door like trick or treat
(Treat!)
Blow your defense down to smitherines
(Smitherines!)
My flow crisp and clean like Listerine
Flow like Drake though
But no Slytherin
Woulda’ got away though
If these kids was not meddling
Pestering
Like your momma ‘take yo’ shoes off when you entering!.’
Shout out all these promo sites who filling up my mentions
I’m a young Canseco!
I said it in the past
On the same tape JBJ rhymed that line with dreidel
If you ain’t been bumping Y.A. you in a cave, though
Can’t get my Tesla ‘cause they moved to outer space, yo

[HOOK: THE DAN REIDY]

[2nd VERSE: THE SARGENT]


She beat her face up
Impressing every look, yeah!
Beat that pussy up
I’mma fuck you so good, yeah!
Come up on my face let me show you what the tongue do
Get up on this dick slide up and down like the sun do
Kicking it no Kung Fu
Kick it like the drums do
Fuck it like there’s hatred but you know I really love you
On the beat like one-two
5, 6, 7, 8!
Kiss that pussy everyday
Swear that you was heaven made
You the lemon to my lemonade
The driver for the getaway
That pussy so damn good
I could fuck you for several days
Need wedding rings
Go ‘head baby come on set the stage
The fire burning let it blaze
Throw it back
Press replay

[3rd VERSE: BRI CRISP, (THE SARGENT) & [THE DAN REIDY]]

[Lookin’ for the one well bitch Dan Reidy is the one!]

I thought the fucking title said it was me being the one

(Nah, don’t make me fuck the homies up
Sargent be the only one.)

Please young baby boy you’re only claim to fame is rolling blunts

(Fuck you mean?
Hold it up!
I beat a beat up swole as fuck
Spit so sick I’m throwing up
My dick held by a golden cup. )

I guess I’d be impressed if you was Charlie and I was Willy Wonka
But the truth of the matter is your dog’s a fucking Prima Donna
He just shit so close to my bag I had to run away before I’d vomit
Still gotta keep an eye on him so he doesn’t bite my arm off

(A nearby shit better than cat piss in ya’ bag, bitch
Just playing
It’s Dan Reidy
And Ersatz, bitch.)
