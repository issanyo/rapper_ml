[Intro]
Unchanging love, unchanging love
Almighty bueno
Almighty bueno
Almighty eres mi todo
Mightier though

[Chorus]
Once I was young
Now I'm old, yeah
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
You were there with your arms wide open
Unchanging love, more than a blessing
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
You were there with your arms wide open

[Verse 1]
I was so confused at a tender age
So caught in a world full of hate
Used to make the wrong choices along the way
I know that I gotta make a change
Finally the loving inside
I started to do some meditation
But it was you, oh Most High
Cuff 'em in the outside

[Chorus]
Once I was young
Now I'm old, yeah
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
You were there with your arms wide open
Unchanging love, more than a blessing
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
You were there with your arms wide open

[Verse 2]
If it wasn't for your love
How I woulda make it through? ooh, ooh
If it wasn't for your love
How I woulda make it through? ooh
If it wasn't for your grace and your mercy
That kept me through
I couldn't do it on my own
I couldn't do this all alone

[Chorus]
I was young
Now I'm old, yeah
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
You were there with your arms wide open
I was young
Now I'm old
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
'Cause of you, my chains were broken
I was young
Now I'm old
I was young
Yeah, yeah
Mighty bueno
