[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It's all about Humongous The God
In Gwalla We Trust
It's DJ Khaled
The streets is talkin' right now
They talkin' Gwalla Gang
They talkin' more gwalla, more wop, more money
You know what it is
The Avengerz
It's DJ Khaled
Ayo, Humongous The God, we on fire
Another One

[Chorus: Humongous The God (Kid Buu)]
East side, east side
East side, east side
So many bands inside my, my eyes
East side, east side

[Verse 1: Humongous The God (Kid Buu)]
Lately I've been servin' J's
Lean flippin', water whippin', syrup sippin'
My bitch trappin', never trippin'
At the condo, move away
Postman just left the trap, got me afraid
Cause you know it came from public housing, section eight
Had to get my mom up out the hood, so I hit Padre
Told him I need dinner plates
New [?] got dealer plates
East side got my pockets straight
East side got my pockets straight
Everyday, get that gwalla when I wake
[?]
Fuck up the block, bitch I made a band today
Fuck up the block, bitch I made a band today

[Chorus: Humongous The God (Kid Buu)]
East side, east side
East side, east side
So many bands inside my, my eyes
East side, east side

[Verse 2: Humongous The God (Kid Buu)]
This for all my trap niggas servin' major waves
Always get it out the country, you just get it out the state
East side where my gwalla stay
You don't got your bands in the safe
Broke boy, get up out my face
Broke boy, get up out my face
Yeah, just get out my face, and get on my level
Yeah, don't believe me, ask your bitch, I bet she can tell you
Got powder, got molly, got lean, out the seal too
We sellin' the islands, got keys [?]
[?], she text me when she through
Paper back money, it come, like Chinese food
Jamaica, Bahama, Japan
I check the trackin' to see if it land
I go to the east side to scoop up a grand

[Chorus: Humongous The God (Kid Buu)]
East side, east side
East side, east side
So many bands inside my, my eyes
East side, east side
