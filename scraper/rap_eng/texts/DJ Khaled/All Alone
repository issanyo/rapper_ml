[Verse]
Yeah
Look
He didn't believe in presidents, all he cared for was dividends
Ain't no tellin' what felons will ever do for benjamins
Guns the size of my leg, pull up, tear off your ligaments
Stay with 4 girls at a time, modern polygamists
Got a sickness, penicillin isn't equipped for this
And my pen is filled up with syphilis, you'll never get this sick
I'm so meticulous, the flow ridiculous
My soul ambigenous, my road is infinite, hold up
Had it bad for real, I'm back from Hell
Mackin' in my black Chevelle and I don't need a strap for real
That's why they mad as hell, and pussy too
That's why I'm packin' Vagisil, it's just for you
And you ain't even half as real as half the shit they put me through, it's cool
I crack the seal, it's Actavis, a bag of pills
A batch will have you crashin', Jesus grab the wheel, hold it still
I start the engine, lost my motor skills
Candy coat and rain in my cup, shit hit my soul for real
I think I'm rollin' still, I roll to kill, and I forgot how sober feels
I know your writer fam, he shoulda wrote your will
I'm under pressure, uh, that's why it's overkill
You know the deal, uh uh, you know the deal

[Outro]
4 in the morning, and you're still callin'
No matter how far I try to go, I keep on fallin'
Now it's 5 in the morning, and I'm still callin'
No matter how far I try to go, I feel so lost here on this road
And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm on my own, on my own, yeah
