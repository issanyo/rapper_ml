[Hook: French Montana]
Woah, have mercy on me, uh
Have mercy on me Father
Cause I've been robbin', I've been stealin'
I've been messed up, haah
For that big gold chain, slang cocaine
Don't get gassed up, haah
There's niggas gettin' murdered, murder, murder
Show you shit you never heard of
Have mercy on me, oh

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana!
Oh la-la-la, La-da-dum
You could break bread or let the bread break you
You can make choices or let choices make you
Came from a hole in hell with hella hoes
Shawty knees weak like Derrick Rose
Baby I'm the one like four quarter
Our Father, I was baptized in dirty water
Lost my right hand, I'm on a different time
Put 5 holes in your face, Olympic sign
Servin' straight white, Gwen Stefan'
Talkin'-talkin' bout, bad breaks, straight grind
I'm in Highland, shawty gone, alien
Came from the corner now homie rockin' stadiums
Couple dollars what the homie kill for
Money order what a killer wish for
Squad have mercy, left the gun range, hopped in the Rover
Woke up, the nigga seen her with a chip on my shoulder

[Hook: French Montana]
Woah, have mercy on me, uh
Have mercy on me Father
Cause I've been robbin', I've been stealin'
I've been messed up, haah
For that big gold chain, slang cocaine
Don't get gassed up, haah
There's niggas gettin' murdered, murder, murder
Show you shit you never heard of
Have mercy on me, oh

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah have mercy on me
Lord knows the devil's been workin' on me
My man got the guns but the work is on me
I'm startin' to feel like a curse is on me
Hooked up the tubes with the nurses on me
Poke some Peru with the purse in Long Beach
Lotta shit that you ain't gon' see
As far as the money goes, you can bank on me
Clips is full, the Rolls-Royce tank on E
And alive is somethin' that you ain't gon' be, yeah
You know what the cash'll do (what?)
It'll make your murder game international
Is it blasphemy if I blast for you?
This amazin' what a gun and a mask'll do
I'm becomin' a beast
I'm the last of a breed that's becomin' deceased
Have mercy

[Hook: French Montana]
Woah, have mercy on me, uh
Have mercy on me Father
Cause I've been robbin', I've been stealin'
I've been messed up, haah
For that big gold chain, slang cocaine
Don't get gassed up, haah
There's niggas gettin' murdered, murder, murder
Show you shit you never heard of
Have mercy on me, oh

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
This goes out to those choose to use disrespectful views
On the king of P-H-I-L-L-Y
Represent the 215
24/7, 365
211's, 187's, who want die?
6 millions way, which one you want try?
Rest in peace to B-I-double G-I
You want trouble? Put you to sleep like a double G hah
What's beef? 20 akhi's strapped like a jihad
See me, slippin' in the streets, never be I
I creep, stay low, and never cease fire
I keep extra gats for extra cats
Yes it's the Mac and I'm back to put the crip on rap
The most crazy, Sigel baby
Mac-10 and eagle crazy, renegade like Slim Shady
That Mossberg 12 gauge bang like M80
Cause damage, god damn it, you can't stand it
Take heed from French Montana and don't panic
I'm a boss in these streets like William and Rameek
That's ball game, flow tight like denim from Balmain

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Have mercy on me, have mercy on them
Get 'em choked with they jeans, get 'em murked in they Benz
Give a fuck about these rappers, care less about they friends
I don't think about they hoes, I don't think about they ends
Let's get a ghost rope, watch all them niggas hang
100 shot Tommy gun, every bullet bangs
Back to bein' holiday, every day holy
You can talk about your Rollie, I can motherfuckin' yap it off
Why don't you go and get and a gun and try to clap it off
Who said they was the king? Wear your crown so I can smack it off
Nigga this is Beanie Sigel, French, Kiss, and Ghost
Fuck around and have you murdered, make you french kiss a ghost
Watch your approach or get stomped like a roach
I'm the ghetto president but ain't never have a vote, never
Watch what you sayin' if you care about your throat
I get every bone broke lil loc, what nigga?

[Hook: French Montana]
Woah, have mercy on me, uh
Have mercy on me Father
Cause I've been robbin', I've been stealin'
I've been messed up, haah
For that big gold chain, slang cocaine
Don't get gassed up, haah
There's niggas gettin' murdered, murder, murder
Show you shit you never heard of
Have mercy on me, oh
