I'm on my way nigga
Fuck the otha side
That side ain't shit
Niggas can't fuck with me

[Chorus:]
Now It's a Special way I fold my flag
And I'll bust ya head if it's bout dat cash
Give me a dickey I don't need that outfit (hol up)
A 305 fitted jus to match my kicks (hol up)

[Verse 1:]
Yeah and I can't even lie
You can tell by my red ass eyes that I'm high
I'm doin' sign language, Screamin fuck the other side
Flawgin' ass niggas ain't nuttin but some liars
We beat niggas have bitches like god
Them boys in that all black wild
Mouths get wide
An bitches get dumb
And bodies gettin lef in the middle a da club
And yeah we love dro

Guns standin from the ceilin to the mothafuckin flo'
An we get it an we go it's like we get it from da sto'
Leave it in the weight house with a dickey full a blow (My Nigga)

[Chorus]

And if you really want it you can get it right now

Why the hell every day you be in that all black
Fresh Pair of J's and you kno they all black

Standin in the trap with my lil' young jits
Gettin off sacks, what you know about this Bout This

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yo you don't really want it, cause you can really get it
You can catch me in that dickie or that 305 fitted
I ain't worried bout a busta, I Ain't worried bout a hoe
If a nigga try me than I'm gonna kill that mothafucka
Fuck the other side, I ain't gotta say it twice
All I do is say it once and my niggas on point
