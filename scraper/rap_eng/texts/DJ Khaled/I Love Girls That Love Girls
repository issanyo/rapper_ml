[Intro: Female Voice]
Baby
I've got something to tell you (eeeh?)
I've been cheating on you (Wha'?!)
But it's with a girl (So what?! *kisses teeth*)

[Chorus]
I love girls that love girls
And I want them in my world
I like girls that love girls
Oh, I'm living in a perfect world
I've met girls that love girls
And I want them in my world
I've had girls that love girls
Love girls
