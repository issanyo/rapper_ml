[Intro: Bryson Tiller & DJ Khaled]
Ayy everybody switchin' up, I guess
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They  tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Future & Bryson Tiller]
I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors
Everything around me too colossal
You niggas old news like a fossil
Every single night I got a bad bitch
She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one
I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay (with foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica (Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Hey, I been reaping those rewards
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me
What? They rather tell somebody else instead of me
Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one
(last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches
Only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me
Another one
Another one

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down

[Interlude: Bryson Tiller & Future]
It's alright, yeah
I'll be alright, yeah
As long as you right here, yeah
I'll be just fine, yeah (I'll be just fine)
Just fine, yeah
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Just fine, yeah
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out
Hey, hey, hey

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
They jealous, they want us to fold
That will never happen
They want us broke, so you know what we gonna do?
We gonna become billionaires
From now on when you see me, call me "Billi"
I'ma be alright, I'ma be just fine.

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no
(They changin', they changin')
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down
