DJ Khaled

(Hook: Sanity)
I need that peace
To my Reese
All my homies know how to preach
I need that peace
I need that Sanity (repeat)

(Verse 1)
I need that silence
Yeah that silence (what)
Because I don't have time for them sirens (sirens)
Yeah them sirens. (Sirens)
The ones that cause them riots (I hate them)
One nigga dead and the others go fighting (what)
But once a nigga kills a nigga it's all silent (not true)
They hypercritical
So unpredictable (no man)
Once u own somebody money U decide to pop that pill though (Molly)
Tryna kill yourself because u don't have hoes (them thots)
All I need is for them to be on the poles (ho)
I'm not into the streets (yeah bro)
And not messing with no beef (yeah bro)
Cuz if a person pop off he'd be gone for a week. (Yeah bro)
Then I got Heat that's gonna seek (yeah bro)
Finding clues in every sheet (bro)
Then once I'm done they keep them burners for a peek (yeah hoe)
I need away from this city because they are mean (mean)
Like mamma always told me to eat them green beans and peas (eat em)

Hook: Sanity)
I need that peace
To my Reese
All my homies know how to preach
I need that peace
I need that Sanity (repeat)

(Verse 2)[DJ Khaled]
I've been messing the the dope (that coke)
Even though my momma told me no
I was watching the pope (my nigga)
He was all white in that robe. (What)
Everyday I look at the news another person's life is on the rope (he gone)
Donald Trump have us done bad because he had no hope (fuck that nigga)
I said Yamine make the lyrics and we getting all hype [Wat]
Every single freaking day I'm dealing with some dykes [what?!]
What do you mean DJ Khaled ain't got no ring
He got more cash then Lil Jon and his bling
Watch me try to make peace with a money making machine (yeah bro)
I'm talking bout the nigga on the corner
Looking at young boys to buy some cola
But it's really that white coke
The one you chop sniff it over and over
Now you a dope head and you ain't come back home uh.... Yeah

I need that peace
