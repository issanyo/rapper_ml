[Intro]
Say dem ago diss who?
Say dem ago diss me?
*kisses teeth*
Chatty mouth that, man...
Dem bad like we?

[Chorus]
A chat, dem a chat
Yap, dem a yap
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
We no cuss-cuss, we no wear frock
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
Tell dem, anything a anything
Any DJ, any sing'
Any vocal, any string
Fi rise against di God is a heavy sin

[Verse 1]
Dem a say, me live a foreign and me nah come back
Have the house pon the hill, dem say, me cyan done that
Me no listen pussy face, jaws, teeth, and tongue cat
Any momma bloodclaat violate, a gunshot
Mama tell me say, "Son, beg you please keep your calm"
"I'm getting old, and me cyan take the drama"
Yeah, but who sell me out? A informer
See death 'round the corner, me nuh lef' mi llama
Right now..me a shot Ginger
From a trigger press, me have a sticky finger
Me no gyal, me no carry pretty finger
12 gauge pellet buss, fling them through window
I'm ready now

[Chorus]
Who did a chat?
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
No cuss-cuss, no lip-lip, no parrot
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
I'm ready now!
Who did a chat?
The Gully Side full of aktion pak
We no beat 'round the bush, no go 'way and come back
Right now we a aktion pak

[Verse 2]
Well, any day dem think dem can diss me
Me make Jamaica haffi rewrite history
Chop off dem head, that sail off like a Frisbee
The fire furnace turn up until it buck and lef' dem cripsy
So serious now, don't even smile at my own jokes
I'm busy counting paper, yow, clashing is for old folks
Now I'm dealing with diamonds and gold, I'm at the coal ports
I'm fucking your girl, yeah, I'm counting my own strokes
I'm ready now

[Chorus]
Who did a chat?
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
No cuss-cuss, no lip-lip, no parrot
Gully Side, we a aktion pak
I'm ready now!
Who did a chat?
The Gully Side full of aktion pak
No beat 'round the bush, no go 'way and come back
Right now we a aktion pak

[Verse 1]
Dem a say, me live a foreign and me nah come back
Have the house pon the hill, dem say, me cyan done that
Me no listen pussy face, jaws, teeth, and tongue cat
Any momma bloodclaat violate, a gunshot
Mama tell me say, "Son, beg you please keep your calm"
"I'm getting old, and me cyan take the drama"
Yeah, but who sell me out a informer
See death 'round the corner, me nuh lef' mi llama
Right now..me a shot Ginger
From a trigger press, me have a sticky finger
Me no gyal, me no carry pretty finger
12 gauge pellet buss, fling them through window

[Chorus]
