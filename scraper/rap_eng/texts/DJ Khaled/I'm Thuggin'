[Intro: DJ Khaled & Ace Hood]
Yeah DJ Khaled, Mean Mug music
Waka Flocka (Ace Hood)
This gon' fuck the streets up
This gon' fuck the club up

[Hook: Waka Flocka]
Police kicked my door and shorty last night
I'd be damned if I don't go out without a fight
My girlfriend says she needs some new shoes in a bag
I tell her shut the fuck up and get off yo ass
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
Middle fingers to the cops and the judge
Raised by the old niggas, just mean mug
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'
Middle fingers to the cops and the judge
Raised by the old niggas, just mean mug

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
God bless a niggas soul, bitch I'm out here
Wear the wrong color, you can't come around here
So get your mind right, and keep your pistol close
Hoppin' out that ride out into your face, just like a seminal
I'm a nigga, stay thuggin', my lil' cousin got his chopper chrome
And a nigga want problems, take your top off like a metro dome
And make a loud noises, sound like it's world war
And never break a sweat, that's what them killers for
I get money ho, on some real shit
Deck 100's on me, that's just what I deal with
Waka's thugged out, and we the business
See me fuck the hammer, bet your niggas feel quick
Mama pray for me, commit a lot of sins
And it don't make it better consumin' a lot of gin
Blood, sweat & tears, I put my soul out
Smell the flowers, bitch, I might just pull the rose out

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
A young nigga thuggin, buckin with his dreads loose
Middle finger all the feds, cause I said too
Now we my G's at? Now where them dope boys?
Now where my niggas who be thuggin' on the corner for it
Hands in the air, throw your hood up
Hoppin' off that 7 trey sixes when I pull up
Now where my bad bitches, who keep that ass fat?
I love a hood bitch, ain't scared to throw that ass back
And I keep them real niggas, homie that's that
You a super duck, I'm talkin' Aflac
My niggas stormed out, stormed out
Stupid dress in them zones with that stone mouth
Club stupid packed, it's a mad house
Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out
And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn
See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse
