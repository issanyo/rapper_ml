(Intro: DJ Khaled)
DJ Khaled!
This for the hood!
They don’t want to see us win!

(Hook: Yamine)
I ride and I shine
And these bitches know why (why)
I’m getting this cash
So my jewelers run and hide (hide)
Run and hide (run and hide) [what]
Run and hide (run and hide) [running]
Run and hide (run and hide)[running]
Run and Hide (run and hide)[running]

[Verse 1: Yamine]
I’m running and hiding
I have no time for violence (Yeah Hoe)
I’m not all about the fighting
When one breaks out there goes the sirens (Yeah Hoe)
I got the friends
And the bands
I also have more rounds for the kindness (Yeah Hoe)
Juicy J and DJ Khaled
Has this beat all up on time and (what)
I’m the king
So I go tossin’ (what)
I keep it flossin
And never go coughin (nope)
I’m in debt
But don’t take loses
I don’t care cuz my j’s in a coffin (Yeah Hoe)
I’m running forever
And not even stoppin
You know what is happening
Once people go shopping
We all end up broke
And niggas still jocking
You got the new J’s
But you keep mopping (oh)
I’m running up some checks (Yeah Hoe)
And nothing is left (Yeah Hoe)
I got a job at the hut
And these niggas don’t rest (nope)
I’m going to keep this going off my chest (chest)
So let’s go back on this hook before I’m in debt (debt)

(Bridge: Yamine)
Niggas know what happens when you bleed (when you bleed)
It drip all over da carpet
Then you leak (then you leak)
I’m running forever and I’m hiding from the police (from the police)
This song is going to be a hit then you leave (you leave)


(Hook: Yamine)
I ride and I shine
And these bitches know why (why)

Run and hide (run and hide) [what]
Run and hide (run and hide) [running]
Run and hide (run and hide)[running]
Run and Hide (run and hide)[running]

(Verse 2)
I used to hustle (hustle)
Not struggle (no struggle)
I got money (money)
From my plug in Lando (Orlando)
My jewelers out of business
Because they ain’t had that cash (broke ass)
Now they running from me
Cuz I’m gonna catch that ass (get back over here)
I’m not slow I’m extra fast
But when it comes to bitches I go full blast (full blast)

I got the sauce so I’m going to all static
I’m not a liar so you bitches go madden

(Bridge: Yamine)
Niggas know what happens when you bleed (when you bleed)
