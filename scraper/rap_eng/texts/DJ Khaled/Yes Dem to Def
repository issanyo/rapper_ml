[Intro]
Yo Crack how many times I gotta keep tellin' this {*censored*}
That you the true king of N.Y
I been tellin' this niggas for years and years and years, man
Sick of this motherfuckers
You Joey Crack, the Don Cartegena
Cook Coke Crack, man
You ain't nothin' to fuck with him
Let this {*censored*}

[Verse 1]
You sicker than conflict this convict's
Back at it again, nope
Crack's at it again, no
Got some new shit for you fiends to smoke
Cook Crack **** fiend for this dope so
I'm here to supply ya
Heard a couple of you rappers wanna retire, such liars
First of all this is me, yes
Joe Crack, I'm a motherfuckin' G, yes
I'm the only one that's really from the streets, yes
Walk through any hood with no police, no vest, yes
Ten mil', pump deal, no stress
Want your casket closed come and see TS, yes

[Break]

[Verse 2]
So much talk of the throne and who's holdin' it
Heard about a new king of the streets and started combin' it
All I seen was studios and car services
Nothin' what I be hearin' up this rap verses-ists
And pardon my Southern slang
I picked up on the accent durin' in my Southern slang
In fact I picked up a whole Southern gang
And picked up a few producers to make the beat go BANG
Khaled
Hot damn it man, we did it again
The beat novacane, the streets weak hopin' and prayin'
MC's know that, these flows, speak, mo' for their pain
That's way pressure I apply, drive motherfuckers insane
To the point you make a mixtape try mention my name
Third page obituaries all attention you gain

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Joe Crack's the piece who ***** shoot you wake up
If it's beef we shootin' first to say break up to make up
Got the world on ice now, courtesy of Jacob
Sky blue band to match the Phantom, fix your face up
Had to switch the flow I'm on the grind, here come the change up
Matta a fact catch me next round, things of that, NATURE

[Outro]
Suckers..... Khaled
Things of That Nature, that's the solo LP
We on a Terror Squad moment right now True Story
You know that
Remy Martin, grand champions
Prospect, Armageddon, Tony Sunshine, Cool & Dre
LV, yeah, big macho L-Boogie
Here come the champs
Here come the champs
Oh
