[Intro: Dj Khaled]
Lil Niqo, You The Future
I Want You To Show 'Em

Lil Niqo:
Ok Then!

Dj Khaled:
Lil Niqo, You 10 Years Old
You Already Killing The Rap Game
We The Best!

[Verse 1: Lil Niqo]
Stunt Time, Here I Go
I'm The Man, Yeah I Know (I Do)
In The Fast Lane, On The Cash Route
Blow A Kiss To Her, Make Her Pass Out
Like Promoters Do Them Flyers
They Always Show Me Love
They Know I'm On Fire
They Notice I'm Hot
Like I'm Sitting On Heaters
They Notice I'm Fresh Like I Own My Own Cleaners
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
10 Years Old, Already Got A Deal
Domino Effect, I Make 'Em All Fall
The Youngest Dude Ballin', I'm On My John Wall (Swish)

[Hook]
Let's Get Something Understood
I Feel Like If I Keep It Real I Can Hit The Hood
I Feel Like All This Money Gonna Make Me Hollywood
I Feel Like I'm Bad, It's All Good
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then

[Verse 2: Lil Niqo]
It's Me, Lil Niqo, AKA Lil Debo
Tell Your Girl What's Hattnen
She Can Be My Hero
More Money, More Money
More Commas, More Zeros
My Stacks Yao Ming (Tall)
Yours Danny Devito (Short)
I Still Keep It G
Still Keep It 100
I Still Do It Big Like Gucci Mane Stomach (Burr)
I Still Go Hard Like I'm On It, Can't Stop
Brand New J's, Michael Jordan Ain't Got
Your Game Ain't Right If Your Chain Ain't Ice
I Stay Fresh, Never Wear The Same Thing Twice
You Really Ain't Fly If You Can't Take FLight
I Can Make Grown Ups Wanna Raise They Price

[Hook]
Let's Get Something Understood
I Feel Like If I Keep It Real I Can Hit The Hood

I Feel Like I'm Bad, It's All Good
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then, That's How I Feel
Ok Then

Money, Money, Money Everywhere Count It
Ok Then
Hundreds, Fifties, Twenties Everywhere Count It
