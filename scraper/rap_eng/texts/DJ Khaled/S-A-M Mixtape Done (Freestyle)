(VERSE)
It's that rhyme feeder, fine speaker, all of my lines ether
Body every mafuckin beat, i'm a crime leader
You throw it 3 point 5, i throw it 9 metres
I'm just better, if you got the juice, nigga i'm sweeter
She offer the pussy, but i don't need her
Cause i just hit her best friend, i ain't lying neither
Said she tired of these dogs, so the lion beat her
Ironic, she finished first, i ain't mind either
Cause i'm fly, bitch i been a jet
120k views for the freestyle, bitch i been the best
Came in the game they were passing, so i intercept
Ateng use the fame, bruh i'm blowing off the internet, how that shit for intellect?
I'm painting pictures, call that pinterest
RKO these fuck rappers, then i pin the rest
1, 2, 3, that's a hat trick, game set and match it
While they on that Tinder stress
Lose someone but find you the winner though
At least one quote in everything i wrote, need that shit like dinner bro
Yeah i know i said a couple things i been, but the way a nigga flow, bitch i been a boat
Was a fiend for the green when i started this
Used to dream bout the scene, now i'm part of it
Fuck you mean? Ain't nobody spit as hard as him
They know the flow fucking cold, need a cardigan

(HOOK)
My signature fade with the bevel blade, that's a major key
If the beat hard, it boil, i like that, that's a major key
Yeah, fuck them haters, done em, find yourself, that's a major key
Yeah, what Tony had on the table it's our buzz, we a major key, nigga
