Nicki Minaj...I'm at MTV. I wanna be honest with you. I love you. I like you. I want you. I want you to be mine.

I'm here at MTV because, this is a worldwide network, and the reason why I'm not telling you this face to face is I understand that you're busy. I'mma be honest with you. I wanna marry you. I'm here today at MTV. Nicki Minaj, will you marry me?

We got the same symptoms: We both suffer from success. You're out there touring, you're out there hustling, you're out there making music, and you're out there winning. I understand.

That's why I feel like you need a man like me in your life. That's gonna take care of you and respect you. You gotta take your time and think about it, I overstand. But I know I'd have to be here today to let you know how serious I am and how serious this is to me.

I wanna let your fans know, my fans know, my family, your family... that I wanna marry you. I've been working hard to get this ring. I would've proposed to you last year. That 'Take it to the head' video. I wanted to tell you... but, you know... things got better for me. I prepared for this day!

So I went and got this ring. Nicki Minaj, will you marry me?
