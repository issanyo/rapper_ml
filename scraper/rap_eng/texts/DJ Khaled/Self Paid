We are going in
Let's go

Grab the money fast
Blow the money quick
Rolling in the Maibach
Like I am fucking rich
Got the class
Got the stacks
We are so great
Got the stacks
Got the racks
We roll pay

From the foreign accent
Know how are dealing with
We are next level
Gotta do it big
[?] presidential suit
Call it Ross parole
Cops around the clock
[?] thousand watch
I ain't gotta stop
These bottles pop
[?] I am the corner stone
When it comes to drop
[?] so high and deep
High [?] for rap
Life or dead is not like [?]
You can decide for that
[?] I am fly man
When I go there is no fly back

Back back and forth
Will be the jack [?]
15 thousand feet dog let's hang
We got your morble waxc
We won't play
Marble wax rose

[Chorus:]
Grab the money fast
Blow the money quick
Rolling in the Maibach
Like I am fucking rich
Got the class
Got the stacks
We are so great
Got the stacks
Got the racks
We roll pay
Grab the money fast
Blow the money quick
Rolling in the Maibach
Like I am fucking rich
Got the class
Got the stacks
We are so great
Got the stacks
Got the racks
We roll pay
