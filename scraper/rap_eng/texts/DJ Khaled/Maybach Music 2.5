Maybach Music
Maybach Music 2 Remix
Let me warn you now
Maybach Music 3
Teflon Don coming soon
We the Best

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'mma make back
Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa)
You gotta see it, hey!
I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Pre-Verse: Pusha T]
Ross, what up?
It's your neighborhood Pusha
Re-Up Gang Records, one half of the Clipse
A.K.A one half of the best duo ever
Haha, check it out

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
You can’t see my eyes in these evidence noirs
Six seventy-five, the frames by Lou Vuitton
Reality bites as the curtain is drawn
Then it’s off to Neverland with t-shirt and don
I was at the six deuce, waiting for the Maybach
Cooking up two in a cue, just so I can make back
Looking for my fortune in a pot, Pat Sajak
Now I’m in the back seat, beach chair, laid back
Play cloths brought a million to my door
Yeah that baby’s mine, every rapper’s beggin' for her
Life as I know it is penthouses and pitfalls
More jealous drivers and fed time, collect calls
They took the family in '09, let’s slow grind
When the time is given we’ll unveil the gold mine
Till the casket drops, it’s show time!

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'mma make back
Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa)
You gotta see it, hey!
I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that

[Pre-Verse: Rick Ross]
Can I talk?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Hoes gettin' arrested, foes get molested
Dough still invested, my dope pause pregnant
The black one is Oprah, call my blue Habo
I crack slice Oprah, bulletproof the car door
Shoes called loafers, chrome forgiatos
I do it like Oprah - give away auto
Send them like Sosa, heavenly father
???
Shortie caught the train, or she at the cabbie
Now she on the plain, flying out to my cabin
My game so elaborate, texture, fabric, soda, the dresses
She's the best in the pageant
Passion of Christ, my fashion is ice
Everyday I'm hustling, pass me the dice
..Nice
