[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I introduce you to
Young Toby
Young Greatness
UK, London massive, bless up
I go by the name of DJ Khaled
Young Toby
Welcome to Roc Nation
Another one

[Verse 1: Toby Randall]
Stay close
Hanging on for dear life
Going out of our minds til at the top
Ready to drop
Same old
We keep living on lies
We don't even realize
We're on the rocks
Ready to drop

[Pre-Chorus: Toby Randall]
I need you to be honest
I need you to be open
Wanna know where your heart is
Behind that wall
And that we made a promise
But we're already broken
Don't know if we can stop this
I'll break the fall

Oh, baby

[Chorus: Toby Randall]
Don't leave
Don't go
Stay close (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)
Where have we gone?
Stay strong (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)

[Verse 2: Toby Randall]
Stay home
Can we talk about love
Can we talk about trust, yeah, face to face
No time to wait
Go slow
But just give me enough
Can't be losing your touch
Let's fill the space
Let's hold the weight (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Toby Randall]
I need you to be honest
I need you to be open
Wanna know where your heart is
Behind that wall
And that we made a promise
But we're already broken
If we try we can stop this
And break the fall

Oh, baby

[Chorus: Toby Randall]
Don't leave
Don't go
Stay close (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)
Where have we gone?
Stay strong (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)

[Bridge: Toby Randall]
Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I know when it'll be crumbling, baby
But I got you, you gotta believe me

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I know when it'll be crumbling, baby
But we ain't going under, believe me, woah

[Chorus: Toby Randall]
Don't leave
Don't go
Stay close (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)
Where have we gone?
Stay strong (oh)
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Hold tight (hold tight)
It's a landslide (landslide)
