[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Ayo, shit real
Real shit
We trap
But we trap to rise above poverty
Humongous The God, straight out the trap
The Avengerz
But representing rising above poverty
It's all about family
It's all about gwalla
In Gwalla We Trust

[Verse 1: Humongous The God & DJ Khaled]
I got a new hoe, now my old hoes call again
I got some new dough, now all my foes wanna be friends
Momma working 2 jobs, life so hard for this boy
Now this young boy only focus on Benjamin's
He left home a bit, but he's back in town
His moneys stacked now, he got his packs now
Another one
Now everybody in the city call him "Young Rich Nigga" now

[Chorus: Humongous The God]
Now everybody in the city call him "Young Rich Nigga" now
He that young nigga they hit up when the packs around
See you gettin' gwalla, now they all wanna come around
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends
Now everybody in the city call him "Young Rich Nigga" now
He that young nigga they hit up when the packs around
See you gettin' gwalla, now they all wanna come around
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends

[Verse 2: Humongous The God]
Won't catch me no Z's, too focused on stackin' those M's
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends
I promised my momma a house and a benz
I promised my daughter whatever she wanted
I promised you, homie, way before emojis, you boy always kept it one-hunnid'
Trapped out, I prayed that my plugs stayed away from the sale
And them feds stayed away from the mail
NBA, MVP, [?], I'm catchin' and runnin' these plays
Might as well call this young nigga "Trap LeBron James"
Had to get gwalla, so it's back to my ways
Back when discussions of pack and decay wasn't just talks about rolling up J's
Lil' homie, I made it
Killed every last one of you lames just to prove I am the greatest
No, I'm not Mike WiLL, but nigga, I made it
My ex hit me up, tryna chill and get faded
But I ain't got no time, I'm tryna get paid quick
Moneys my mission, Tom Cruz with the [?]
You should sit aside, like a Knicks game
I don't switch up, only switch lanes

[Chorus: Humongous The God]
Now everybody in the city call him "Young Rich Nigga" now
He that young nigga they hit up when the packs around
See you gettin' gwalla, now they all wanna come around
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends
Now everybody in the city call him "Young Rich Nigga" now
He that young nigga they hit up when the packs around
See you gettin' gwalla, now they all wanna come around
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends

[Outro: DJ Khaled & Humongous The God]
DJ Khaled!
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be
Wanna be friends
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends
Another one
Tell them fuck boys I don't wanna be friends
