[Intro]
I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

[Chorus]
She'll make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It's all right, alllll right
Win or lose, take her for jewels
It's alright, alllll right
I said don't lose yourself
In that mud, cause it get rainy all the time
She on that pole forever
So right now, it's too many singles on the ground (yeah!)

[Verse 1]
She said I'm a freak
But I'm not promiscuous
I like shit discreet
She ain’t know what the difference was
Said she wanna come back just to smoke and chill with us
I told her get a taxi, I hopped up in my sprinter bus
You pullin' up in the Maybach and I asked how much the rental was
Dinner date with her man, I still asked how much dinner was
Beehive outside the fucking studio
I told Smitty don’t knock it down, bitch don't kill my buzz

[Bridge]
I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

[Chorus]
She'll make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It’s all right, alllll right
Win or lose, take her for jewels
It's alright, alllll right
I said don't lose yourself
In that mud, cause it get rainy all the time
She on that pole forever
So right now, it's too many singles on the ground (yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Don't hate the playa
Girl, just hate the game
My stomach turned, it had too much to drank
I hit Golden Krust
Cause I was feeling urghy
If Shaun wasn't Livingston, would they sell curry?
Tell the driver be here 12:30
Call Nessa cause I can’t go with my nails dirty
She askin' too many questions 'bout who my exes is
So I kindly got up showed her where the exit is

[Bridge]
I'm win or lose tonight
It cost to live this type of life (yeah)
She said I might move tonight
But only if that price is right (yeah)

[Chorus]
She'll make the news, in Giuseppe shoes
It’s all right, all right, alllll right
Win or lose, take her for jewels
It’s alright, alllright
I said don't lose yourself
In that mud, cause it get rainy all the time
She on that pole forever
So right now, it's too many singles on the ground (yeah!)
