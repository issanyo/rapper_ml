Yeah
Just some shit I wrote in class
And thought it went with to this beat
So let’s see
Yeah

Hook
I’m up when everybody is down
Don’t smoke but my style too loud
Riding with this vibrant thing
Stay sane but the city going cray
Cops killing everything that's living
All we want is justice we get tales
I can not put up with this life i’m living
To be honest think we died and we in hell
Yeah

Verse 1
Living life like this
Hoping that I’d never have to fight like this
It’s these niggas that might rob you blind
Bruce wayne kill yo dad and moms
Mom
Lost in my mind
Fear two things
Police and crime

But i wanna live past 25

But look at this

These niggas ain't know
These niggas should know
My soul is gold
My soul is cold
No don't touch me
Don't you touch me
Swear My mind is so unfocused

And I might choke ya
You thought shit was sweet till libra

On the wrong block caught slacking
Knocked the nigga back pack off
Get to blasting
Blah blah blah blah blah

Hook
I’m up when everybody is down
Don’t smoke but my style too loud
Riding with this vibrant thang
Stay sane but the city going cray
Cops killing everything that's living
All we want is justice we get tales
I can not put up with this life i’m living
To be honest think we died and we in hell
Yeah
