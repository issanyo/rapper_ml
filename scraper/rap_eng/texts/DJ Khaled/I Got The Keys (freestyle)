[Hook: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
