Look at the flick of the wrist
I dont see you niggas getting no bigger than this
I got money and need to pick in a peak
Women love to fuck a nigga one need to kill with the heat
Rollie got the black diamonds got the tars in it
I take a first class ticket and put them pars in it
I got a couple a bitches and kingin' diamond
Could sit when a nigga
Icey to light it hipnotize your bitch
Niggas need to get their shit straight
These niggas need to get their motherfuckin shit straight
Niggas love to say im broke how i was running round 50 thou
Plus a feature name bieber on a mixtape
I got the glass walls for the crib sake
I gotta hit it at it i make the crib shake
I gotta take advantage of the chance that I'm granted
Just to see these hatin' niggas make the sick face ohhhhh
Well how you love a nigga, its either leave it or pimp it
If she as fuckin' niggas
I keep an oven open over these
Suckas i ain't fuckin' with these niggas
That hated but said that they love a nigga noooo
Ain't no time for co-signs niggas wasn't givin' it
These niggas was livin' it up
Droppin the rock im pickin it up
Robbin the game im stickin it up
Flow stingin' like spillin per rocks still in the cut
Still in the cut for niggas think im givin a fuck
Not never im probably the hottest ever
Yes nigga i been on this obsecure level that niggas can never Matter with
