[Bridge]
Wow, wow
I man...
Higher than high man..
Zoom high, a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world, me nuh coach man
Nuh inna my league
Watch ya now

[Hook]
Them nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them a hype with a little bit of money and weed
Nuh reach nowhere, and a say them a lead
Nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them too slow, them a invalid
Man full of step like a centipede
Nuh inna my league

[Verse 1]
First thing, give Jah thanks for the most things
Security higher me guard
Look 'pon me house and me yard
And me one dozen pit bull dog
This industry must be me girl
'Cause me fucking this industry hard
Nuff a chat and them a hype and suss
And them nah live better than dog
Me bank account gone psycho
Five hundred milli 'pon the house title
You nuh see your slow life is a cycle?
You nuh see me fast, ten times nitro?
Me a do it like Nike
Tell them drop asleep, like night
Lord Jesus Christ
Nah sell out the Gully for no peas and rice

[Hook]
Nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them a hype with a little bit of money and weed
Nuh reach nowhere, and a say them a lead
Nuh inna my league
Them nuh inna my league
Them too slow, them a invalid
Man full of step like a centipede
Nuh inna my league

[Verse 2]
A fi mi school, a the time for devotion
Them soft like lotion
Them a make scraps, we a make potion
Yes, I'ma turn river into a ocean
Zoom high, a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world, me no coach man
From Town to Mobay, have the most don
Buss out the coil, it's a real money motion

[Hook]
Nuh inna my league
None nuh inna my league
Them a hype with a little bit of money and weed
Nuh reach nowhere, and a say them a lead
Nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them too slow, them a invalid
Man full of step like a centipede
Nuh inna my league

[Bridge]
Wow, wow
I man...
Higher than high man..
Zoom high, a the cloud him a float pon
First class to the world, me nuh coach man
Nuh inna my league
Watch ya now

[Hook]
Them nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them a hype with a little bit of money and weed
Nuh reach nowhere, and a say them a lead
Nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them too slow, them a invalid
Man full of step like a centipede
Nuh inna my league

[Hook]
None nuh inna my leauge
Them a hype over little bit of money and weed
Nuh reach nowhere, and a say them a lead
Nuh inna my league
Nuh inna my league
Them too slow, them a invalid
Man full of step like a centipede
Nuh inna my league
