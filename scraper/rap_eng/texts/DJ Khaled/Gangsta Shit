[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Now I ain't really got time for the he say
She say yellin ova tracks like a motherfuckin DJ
Dey beggin for attention I'm beggin for a reason
Masked up get these straps yeh it's unseasoned
These niggas broke they joke
Laugh at you niggas sit back and smoke (Ha-Ha)
Gangsta shit duffle bag full of bricks
Add it all up save for the chips
Holy Guacomole! datz a whole lot dip
12 months, run that's a whole lot of flips
Well bury ya today datz a whole lot of trips
Say he got six chevys now that's a whole lot of whips
(What's up)

[Hook]
Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit
Gangsta shit I'm just a young ghetto nigga with a big azz chain

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
You recreate a shield you betta respect us
Betta understand the game, these checks, not checkers
Two chunked out chains we call dem double deckers
You comin for that saint nigga we bound to wreck ya
My niggas add flavor to the game like zeteran
Bitch my 25th tool I'm a concrete veteran
We eat wheat niggas up like corn on the cob
You a hustla, naw don't quit ya day job!

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game
I call dem trap actors half the niggas lame
But on the real shit
Felons still tow the heap
Real thug bread O.G. like Bun B
Jeezy from the hood
Slick from the gutta
We to real ova here to fall out like Cash Money brothers
Naked boy smith
Ran for Evan Smith
Ross facin life and that's rich now that's Gangsta Shit!

[Hook]
Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit
Gangsta shit I'm just a young ghetto nigga with a big azz chain

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Cali gon cali ridin tall in his saddle
Pullin up low and with that choppa I'm ready for battle
It's gangstas from San Francisco and up to Seattle
We ain't with all that snitchin shit so mane go and get tattle
I'm a dirty south legend and thou shall honor the team
From the land of the long hard
Where we home sellin D
Get that dirt weed local
Not the indo ship
Not to mention the gallons of Promethazine that we sip
