[Verse 1]
November 5th, and now she's sixty
Riding down the highway with her friends at her side
Her life without them wouldn't be complete
They are her joy and pride
She's learned a lot from all her good friends
About turning sixty, she's the first to reach that stop
We're gonna party 'til we just can't party no more
She's big on cocktails, Nobu Malibu
Hermes, Birkins, Chanel
Givenchy, momager meetings
Christmas Eve parties, lots of vodka
Baby showers, Khloe money parties
Valentino, keeping up on Sundays
Everybody, they ain't happy
Cause the girls are shining all the time
Looks like another fun-filled day

[Chorus]
She loves her friends
(We love you)
(She loves you)
She loves her friends
(She loves you)
(Friends, she loves you)
She loves her friends
(She loves you)
(She loves you)
(She loves us)
(We love it, and we love you)
(She loves you)
(She loves you)
(She loves you)
(No she loves you dude)
(She loves you)
(No she loves you)

[Verse 2]
Look at her friends, look at their faces
Look how they all go to such chic places
Look at these girls, there's nothing like them nowhere
(She loves shoes...I mean you)
Craig's (She loves you)
Balmain (She loves you)
Glam squad (She loves you)
Beverly Hills Hotel (She loves you)
(She loves you) (She loves you)

[Outro]
She loves her friends
(She loves you)
(She loves you)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
She loves you

[Outro Continued]
(She loves you)

She loves her friends
(She loves you)

She loves her friends
