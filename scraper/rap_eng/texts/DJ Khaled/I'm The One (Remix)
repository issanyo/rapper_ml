[Hook]
I'm the one that right beside you when you wake up
I'm the one that you rely on, I'm your day one
I'm the one, yeah
She the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah

Alright, check it out, look

[Verse 1]
I'm the one for the one on one, there's no runner up
Your love is tough but we fightin', fuck it, we suck it up
I met you back when I was broke, I had like 20 bucks
But now I'm just so in love with you that I can't fuck this up
My time is never wasted if I waste time with you
Look at that ass in them jeans, like look how that waist line fit you
Baby, please you're my queen and we can face our issues
The white rapper, shit, you thought I was from 8 mile, didn't you?
Hella tats all on me, it's like she's datin' some criminal
But she's not, I'm a gentleman and I mean that literal
Where I grew up we had it rough, we had no name 'round cereal
Now we travel foreign countries, eatin' grapes and cheerios, ha
My life-style has been quite wild but she there beside me
The rarest body, she protective 'cause she care about me
She 'bout her business, fuck these bitches, she ain't here to party
Everytime she stare back at me, it's like I hit the lottery

[Hook]
I'm the one that right beside you when you wake up
I'm the one that you rely on, I'm your day one
I'm the one that still prefer you with no make up
I'm here to make you feel better when your day sucks
I'm the one that's really for you, fuck that fake love
You the one who had my back before I came up
I'm the one, yeah
You the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah
You the one, yeah

[Verse 2]
We blowin' smoke out while we swervin' in that fast lane
Your first name will sound perfect with my last name
These bitches jealous to be honest, that's a bad trait
'Cause they the type to steal the roaches out of ashtray
That's lame, in our relationship the trust is most important
So I trust the fact you trust me and it doesn't go unnoticed
Never fuckin' with these hoes, they keep on comin' on my shows
And you'd feel comfortable to know
That once I'm done I've had it home, that's right
Now we here, it's been about three years
You told me not to overthink and now my doubt seem clear
Yo, she the realest, I can feel it, dawg.. she ain't no groupie
So now whenever she gets change
I gotta praise that booty, I swear
When we first met I'd always say some stupid
Now she's my inspiration when I make my music, it's crazy
I think about her every day, every night
When I'm on tour, I'm at a hotel, just waitin' to skype, alright

[Hook]
I'm the one that right beside you when you wake up
I'm the one that you rely on, I'm your day one
I'm the one that still prefer you with no make up
I'm here to make you feel better when your day sucks
I'm the one that's really for you, fuck that fake love
You the one who had my back before I came up
I'm the one, yeah
You the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah
You the one, yeah
