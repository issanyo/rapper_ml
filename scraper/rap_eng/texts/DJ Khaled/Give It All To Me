[Verse 1: Mavado]
Party 'til the sun comes up
'Til the sun goes down
Turn up the sound

Oh so round like a English pound
Like a dog me a roam
Like a dog to a bone
No long talk like no phone
Like a Benz with chrome me haffi make her my own

[Chorus: Mavado]
So girl, I want you give it all to me

Gyal the way you a whine, gyal you know say it groovy
You groovy
Dem ah pree, dem ah stare, dem ah watch like movie
Movie
You a tell me you bad, now a time 'fi you prove it
So prove it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Mavado, tell em lick a shot; hollow.(Gun Shot)
Tell 'em say we straight; arrow
Tell 'em the flow tight; narrow
Everyting me did a'start, them borrow
Cruised up, link my dudes up
The coupe black & blue, yup, it's bruised up!
I'm like, "Who's up?" Girls is used up
These bitches is my sons, I tied my tubes up!
Tell 'em again, bad gyal, toast is oozed up
I hit up Instagram, post some nudes up
Uhn - bon fire, rev it, pop a wheelie!
Caribbean girls run it, ask RiRi!

[Chorus: Mavado]
So girl, I want you give it all to me
Give it all to me
Gyal the way you a whine, gyal you know say it groovy
You groovy
Dem ah pree, dem ah stare, dem ah watch like movie
Movie
You a tell me you bad, now a time 'fi you prove it
So prove it

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Badness check, sexiness check
Walk pass man a broke them neck
Style check, intelligence check
Pandemonium when you step
Say just send me a text
Whatsapp message, me na' use BBM
Gal you hotter than them, gal you a problem

[Chorus: Mavado]
So girl, I want you give it all to me
Give it all to me
Gyal the way you a whine, gyal you know say it groovy
You groovy
Dem ah pree, dem ah stare, dem ah watch like movie

You a tell me you bad, now a time 'fi you prove it
So prove it

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
I'll handle you
Let me dance for you
I might be thinking 'bout leaving my mans for you
I'll handle you
Let me dance for you
I might be thinking 'bout leaving my mans for you, (yeah)

[Outro: Mavado & Nicki Minaj]
Like a dog me a roam
Like a dog to a bone
No long talk like no phone
Like a Benz with chrome me haffi make her my own
[Nicki Minaj]
Make me your own baby

I'm here. I'm here. I'm here!
So girl, (Pretty Gang in a' the place) a want you give it all to me
