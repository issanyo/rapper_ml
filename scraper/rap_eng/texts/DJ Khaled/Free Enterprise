[Intro: Rick Ross]
God is great, first and foremost, uhh
Don't you wish everything could be so perfect?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Free enterprise, overexposed
Irritated, uneducated still scribble my flows
The jubilation, the euphoria
Pushing a foreign in the morning, pick your daughter up
Drop your seed off, let the weed up
Slow motion, fast forward till we speed up
Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth
Get away from me! You looking so suspicious
Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas
Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes
Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes
You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on her shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man get life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the night never pierced her ears
Time will come when all that nice shit disappears
Why you think I'm on the night shift with the pills?
Mind frame of that boy that was found slain
Mild slang, you can tell I been around 'caine
Double R, Ricky Ross, bitch we been the gang
Bottom of the black market, time to rise again

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
My inner Andre 3000, uhh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
So many false allegations, is my image tainted
3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous
As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted
All i wanted was some Belaire and a Danish
Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it cause' I'm rich and I know what pain is?
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music, do you know what rhythm is?
Stick your hand in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight player, my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash to beef, I kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man'll kill a bitch

[Outro: John Legend]
So if I die before I wake
Say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect (no)
Never said that I deserved it (no)
Never said I wouldn't lie (no)
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry (no)
But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright
It was so amazing, so amazing (as I look back on my)
It was so amazing, so amazing
I wouldn't change a thing, no no no
No, ohh
It was so amazing, so amazing, ohh
It was so amazing, so amazing
I wouldn't change a thing
