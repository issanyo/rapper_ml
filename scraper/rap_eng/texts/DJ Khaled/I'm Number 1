[Intro: DJ Khaled & Birdman & Nelly]
We number ONE! (Yeah, so fresh, so fly)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Ay; fourth quarter, I'm goin hard
If my money's stupid my credit card's a retard
The Lamborghini Bugatti all in the same yard
I want the freak and the lady all in the same broad
BALLIN - way before Jim Jones
I gots to be the richest nigga with this skintone
Somebody get the doctor on the phone
My diagnosis, I got gettin money syndrome
Hey! I got that hustler's disease
I got paper chasin tendencies and they yet to find a remedy
So shorty feelin me the way I be dressin
She like my white tee, neck V, Polo pressin
My tie gold and purple and my three-piece vest and
I'm a young woman's blessin, I'm every woman's confession
To older women you can call me cougar bait
To all you haters I'mma call you too late

[Hook: DJ Khaled & Birdman & Nelly 4x]
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)


[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, yeah, swagged out
Diamond 'round my neck, diamond 'round my teeth
Diamond on my bitch, diamond on my fleet
Hardly on the bike, love a nigga stripes
Five star O.G., 3rd Ward, loud pipes
Uptown soldier, floss on the ave
Make a hundred G's nigga bouncin on the slab
Make a hundred G's nigga spend it on the ave
Move a hundred B's garbage bag full of cash
Yard to the lot, shittin on they ass
Weed's in the Hummer, 250 on the dash
Yeah - early in the mornin when the sun shine
Got a yacht in the yard, ocean fly
Ocean time, ocean view
Pearly white waves, on them 22's
Five new Bentleys, out the paper bag
To the paper tag - shinin on they ass

[Hook:]
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
I'm number one, one, one! (Stunna) (Dirty) (Stunna) (Dirty)
