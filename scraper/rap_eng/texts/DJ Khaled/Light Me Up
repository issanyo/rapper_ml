[Verse 1:Just Ivy]
Ain't Nobody Gonna Tell Me Why Im So Caught Up
I already Know I Lost My Mind Im Going Under
Everybody Says To Take My Time, But I Wanna Rush
I Been Waiting For You All My Life, I Can't Wait Another
Night
To When The Stars Come Out I'ma Wear You Down
Oooh, Tonight
Anywhere You Go You Know I'll Follow You

[Pre-Hook: Just Ivy]
On A One Way, one way Out My Mind Fast Like The Speed of Light
Back to Life I Wanna Love
On A One Way, one way Out My Mind Running To The Fire
Cause I ain't Afraid to burn
