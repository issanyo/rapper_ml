[Verse 1]
Started off with a simple twist of fate
Boyfriend gonna come catch my fade
Mama said, "Come in, it's gettin' late"
Tell that woman she gots to wait
Find somethin' worth fightin' for
If you ain't gonna get them drawers
If you lose, gonna catch a case
Did you go too far? Baby, anyway
Just stories 'bout things I do
Show you, girl, it was all for you
Had hoes in the hotel room
Never knew we would make that news
I'm too good with social cues
Left out 'fore I had a chance to choose
Me or him, or where your dad been?
That's somethin' my pride cannot lose
Too much on the way I feel
Trick myself to believe it's real
Trick too much for the sex and feel
When I get a mil' I'ma spend it all on real
I'ma spend it all on feels, yeah

[Hook]
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
Just drippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
I'm just drippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
Trippin', no
Ooh, I ain't trippin' on a bitch
Trippin', no
Ooh, I'm just drippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
Just drippin' on a bitch
I ain't trippin' on a bitch

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
And if I'm lyin', I'm flyin', heart of a lion
Got the future on the hide, my hotel, I hide
I hope you're stayin' by
I need you for five, I need you for five
You need me, I'm the plug to the life that you desire
You need me for the game, game, oh
You need me for the game, for the game, oh
I need you for five, I need you for five
You need me, I'm the plug to the life that you desire

[Chorus]
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
Trippin', no
I ain't trippin' on you, baby
Trippin', no
I ain't trippin' on one thing
And I ain't gon' slip
And I ain't trippin' on one thing
I ain't trippin' on you, baby
Trippin', no
I ain't trippin' on you, baby
Trippin', no
I ain't trippin' on one thing
And I ain't gon' slip
And I ain't trippin' on one thing

[Outro]
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', baby
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', baby
I ain't trippin' on a bitch
