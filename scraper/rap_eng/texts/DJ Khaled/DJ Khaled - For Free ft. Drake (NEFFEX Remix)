(Pre:)
Do you ever ask yourself
Is it just me, is it just me
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?

(Verse 1:)
I want a bad chick
She got a body
A real bad bitch
She knows how I like to party
On a mattress
With a handle of Bacardi
And the fact is
You know we're just getting started

I want a bad chick
Not an Instagram model
Ima go to campus
Alpha phi is such a brothel
And this shit is madness
So I drink another bottle
Ima drink this shit
Till the ladies look like models

Back up back up
Back it up for me girl
You such a bragger wasssup
Come and work for me girl
I got a fat cup filled up
Come and give me a twirl
And we gon stack up my luck
Till I finally hurl

I got this party on lock
Somebody pass me the rock
I'm bout to pop the top off someone hand me a shot
This girl has got a hot bod like she been doin squats
And you know that I can't stop till I got her on top haha

(Verse 2:)
You know I came to fuckin ball in the city man
Grew up in OC where all pretty ladies land
I used to play baseball and a couple bands
We'd shoplift at the mall alcohol get slammed

And I'll be damned if the plan wasn't to expand
Recently we in demand with the music man
I got the right wrist band on my right hand
About to make a couple grand with the right brand

I got fat stacks playin games of black jack
She wants my hat back but she cannot have that
I gave her mad cash I can't even add that
She had a bad dad that's why she's a badass

I'm on the fast track yea we fuckin passed that
Put you on blast jack better get your hazmat
I wanna tap that so I gotta trap that
She's got an ass tat likes it when I rap fast
