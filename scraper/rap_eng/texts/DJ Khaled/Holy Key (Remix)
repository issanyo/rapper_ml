[Verse 1: Kuro Silence]
Bullets straying
Amazing graces is playing
Preying on innocence
Prescription is ignorance
You're blissfully unaware
I'm beast and I'm smelling fear
I'm leaving my path clear
You niggas best not get near
Or I'm tearing your crew to shreds
The chopper turn you to swiss
I'm Jacking you for that cheddar
Your bitch say I kiss it better
I came in the game a veteran
Pull up and I make you regret
My lingo nice
And I'm skeptical of niggas
Why you talking shit?
I'm talking real you bitch

You ain't shit to me
Breaking industries
Cake Up like a bakery
45 seal the fate of me
Aim For many enemies
You'll never pull ahead of K
Never you beheading K
If I pull it out then I'mma be
Killer but never G

But I'm pulling back the slide
If I see you clocking me
Wasted time spit cyanide
Been waiting for the longest time
Just to get a piece of mine
You had better get it right
Fuck up count
Insure you die
Niggas really from the wire
Urban living straits is dire
Doughboy say run your attire
Then pull off on 2 foot tires

So I'm popping every critic
Don't care if you like my lyrics
Just know that soon as you hear it
Ain't nobody coming near it
Less they're sitting on them thrones
Dropping bombs like I'm them drones

I'm speeding and you're too slow
Like saying K U R and O
Can't no one pronounce it right
But soon as this music drop
I'm making them
Remember the mad minds
Till my heart stop



[Verse 2]
Flaming tracks is arson
So I'm asking that you call the fire marshal please
Tired of the city where you duck the niggas and police
Aiming for your melon
'Fore they pull that piece and split your shit
Savage fuck up shit on no abandon like a dirty bitch
Who the fuck am I?
A writer coming with the dopest shit
Sonic coke I'm fucking with your mental
Come and take a sniff
Lately I've been in my headspace tired of that shit
Blowing out your tires
If you try to ride out on my clique
Belling through the streets
If you know that then I'mma see you there
Chilling with my niggas
Looking for figures to come up with
Follow protocol if you ain't setting trends cause you don't lead
Never high but always in the clouds like I was bnb
Say fuck them Bs
Check my Repertoire then come on back to me
It's best to flee like markets we
Got marks and scarring never sparing
Kid you're fucking up
Never should you step to us
Nigga got the holy key
High key with my lyrics like Alicia be
You missed your key you're history mystery how I can speak with all of this ability
New niggas ain't trill to me
That's just how it is you see
Don't want no war but know
I'm never scared of beef
Don't play with me

Yeah yeah
Woah
Ahh
Yeah
Yeah

Holy, holy, holy, holy key

[Hook/Outro: Betty Wright & Dj Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key (x2)
