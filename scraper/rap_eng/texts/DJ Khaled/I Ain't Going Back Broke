[Intro: Mavado & Future]
Mavado
Grindin‘ everyday

I be thinkin’ about how far I done came
See, I’m gettin’ money
But I could be gettin' more
I ain’t going back broke

[Hook: Future & Mavado]
Drophead Phantom
Drophead Bentley
Drophead Ghost
(I Ain’t going back)
I got nothin’ to prove (I got nothing to prove)
I got to much to lose (I got to much to lose)
I ain’t going back broke nigga
You motherfucker's take me for a joke until I spray mo'
I ain’t going back broke nigga
And the ice is just some bling to me
I'm livin’ what used to be a dream to me
I ain't going back broke

[Verse 1: Mavado]
Mi wake up fi hear dem, put money pon mi head
So mi have 2 Rottweiler at mi bed, weh mi feed dem lead
Mi hustle hard fi di bread, mi guns out dem
Mi pop mi haters like thread, mi said
Picture me roll out, well gold out, inna mi 5-50
Real dogs, eat with me, die with me
Mi high as a fuckin' flight, who waan get high with me?
Mi bad gyal, sleep with me, cry with me
Heh

Fuck it, I ain’t goin’ back
I ain’t goin’ back
Fuck it, I ain’t goin’ back

[Hook: Future & Mavado]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Did this here for my niggas
Did this here for my momma
Long way from them projects
And I started up from that bottom
Ain't interested in new friends
Copped my mama that Benz
No, my daughter don't want for nothing
Cause daddy making them ends
I ain't going back
All of them times and all of them years
All of that suffering had me in tears
All of that pain for me to be here
All of that doubt, all of that hate
Some of them real, some of them fake
I’m just sick and tired of being sick and tired
I know we all can relate
That I ain’t going back
No, no, nooo
Fuck it I ain’t going back
I’m all about the money bags
Fuck if you ain’t down with that

[Hook: Future & Mavado]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
Khaled tell me no new friends, just make new money!
Mansion pon di hill, I just build that fi my mommy!
Man rise from di concrete, back there inna di gutter
Mi can’t forget when mi used to suffer
Now picture me inna my gold and black, Jamaica proud
Every Gully, every Gaza, and Alliance proud
Now picture me rise to di top and make Jamaica proud
Cassava Piece mi from, that's why mi say this loud, heh
I ain't going back broke nigga
I ain't going back
Fuck it, I ain't going back broke nigga
I ain't going back
Fuck it, I ain't going back
