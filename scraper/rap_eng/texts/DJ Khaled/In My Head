Intro
For you never look back to you set me free
Time to let me go over your head
Is it right is it good that your mine or not
Verse
In My Mind your the one who always thinking about
You in my head never thought your here
Also today my brain is shaking because of you
Why I am so blind your so dead
Chorus
In My head the one and only boy who always thinking
Of me too forever will be young together
Hope to see each other no matter where you are
I' LL be there for
Bridge
Out there today and tomorrow now and forever we will
Be together before you leave me here
In the rain and cold weather out in the sky and full
Of pain in my heart
Intro
Oh! your now going home without me back here let
Me have the black coat of yours
Good when we will me meet again tomorrow or on
The other day still waiting here and started
Hating you
Verse
Up in the sky there will be a shooting star out night
I can fly high just to be with you
And never let me go far away from your side
Rather than to be alone we will ride
Together
Chorus
In My Head the one and only boy who always thinking
Of me too forever will be young together
Hope to see each other no matter where you are
I'll be there for
