Loyaldi I be that street cat
Alumni nigga
Graduated from the petty spats
All about my money loyalty and a fat ass
I can make room for you why you trippin
Baby where you at? Damn!
Giving me no response
You ain't gotta treat me like that
Girl I'm the one
Only one that ah hold you down
There to listen
Only one that ah be around
Netflixin chillin never missin
And we can cuddle after I ain't in a hurry
Fuck that cold attitude fuck that mcflurry
Baby girl I'm that dude you ain't gotta worry
All I ask you love me let's get down and dirty
