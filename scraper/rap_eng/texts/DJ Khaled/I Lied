[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I'mma lie for my dawg, I'mma ride
Just know I'mma lie (DJ Khaled)

[Chorus: French Montana & Meek Mill]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (Meek Milly)
With my hand on the Bible, (let me tell you) I lied, I lied, I lied

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And I got up on that podium and lied (I lied, I lied)
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth nothing but the whole truth
And he got up on that podium and cried
Said I tried to take his life and the judge ain't take my side
Cause when you black, that risk is high to beat that case against them odds
Against them guys with your last bit of money for your lawyer
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us
They caught us

[Chorus: French Montana & Beanie Sigel]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (uh-huh)
With my hand on the Bible (uh-huh), I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Only swear by a law so when approached by them folks
I spit the truth when I swore under oath (I lied, I lied)
Shit, cause I don't take the stand on niggas
I rather give it to that man up close (blocka, blocka)
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more
See you when they free you cuz cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back on fouth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I'd be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate
Niggas jumping on your case, worst than First 48
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will

[Chorus: French Montana & Jadakiss]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing (uh), nah I ain't hear nothing (nah)
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied (You know my rights)
I swear to tell the truth (ahem), nothing but the whole truth (Hah-hah)
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
It was we vs. them vs. three then ten
Swore I never re again but I lied, I lied (I lied)
Now the package is enormous and that come with informants
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us
We just being hard headed, disregarding the drop
Them they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot
Found six P's of piffy, a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me
I miss my goddaughter, I wonder if she miss me
Birthdays and Christmas, I ain't never missed it
Her dad is my brother, I love him from a distance

[Chorus: French Montana]
I know I told you I stopped (what?) slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
