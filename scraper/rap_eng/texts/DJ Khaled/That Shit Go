[Verse 1: Poo Bear]
I met a stripper named Tesla, pussy charged up like a lecturer
Ride the dick super fast, you know and the smoke OG, no regular
And she only gotta work 3 days in a week
Even when she in bed, that money don't sleep
Stay sippin' that lavender, screwed the boy spectacular
Through a whole pack of Magnums
Flip cakes like a spatula, ass shots but her tits still natural

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go, oh

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
She got that pina colada, niggas keep blowin' them dollars
Gotta run outta that
Bust it open on a [?] lover, lover, woo
And she gotta get that I'm a motherfucker

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go, oh

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I met a stripper named Tesla, pussy charged up like a lecturer
Ride the dick super fast, you know and the smoke OG, no regular
And she only gotta work 3 days in a week
Even when she in bed, that money don't sleep
Stay sippin' that lavender, screwed the boy spectacular
Through a whole pack of Magnums
Flip cakes like a spatula, ass shots but her tits still natural

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go
That shit go
Yeah, that shit go, oh

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ah, oh
