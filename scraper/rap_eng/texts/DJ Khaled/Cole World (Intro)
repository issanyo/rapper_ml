[DJ Khaled]
Ayo, Keyshia Cole, I’m just gon’ tell you how it is
They wanna finish you, they want you broke
They want you miserable, they want you unhappy
That will never happen
They played themselves
We the greatest ever
It’s a process for progress
I respect those that weather the storm
We weather any storm
We gon’ continue climbing the mountaintop
More wins, more success, more blessings
Notice how I said ‘more’
It’s a cole world—a Keyshia Cole world
Bundle up, special cloth alert—DJ KHALED!

[Keyshia Cole]
Special (Another one) cloth alert
A cole, cole, cole, Cole World
And I put that on everything
A cole, cole, cole, Cole World
