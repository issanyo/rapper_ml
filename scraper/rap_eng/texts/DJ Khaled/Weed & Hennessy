[Intro]
The streets a speak up
A fi da summer yah

[Chorus]
A wha' we waan?
Weed and Hennessy
And a little tip of grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi da Summer yah
Weed and Hennessy
And a little tip of grabba leaf
Bere gyal inna the vehic's
Full suit a Louie V
That mi waan fi da Summer yah

[Verse 1]
Drive out the truck
Drive out the car
Ride out the bike
Gyal cock up pon the back a wha' mi like
Load up mi cup
Gimme a spliff
Gimme a light
Champagne cork fly like a kite
Mi just get a new gyal
And say, "Call up your crew, gyal"
Me and mi dawgs dem a gyallis usual
How we do, gyal deal with it crucial
Re-re-real
Real boss, have papers fi burn
Holiday weekend, tables a turn
Worst when your money straight like perm
Hotel presidential suite confirmed

[Chorus]
A wha' we waan?
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit of Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi da Summer yah
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Bere gyal inna the vehic's
Full suit of Louie V
That mi waan fi da Summer yah

[Verse 2]
Then you nuh see the whole place tun up?
Then you nuh see how dem yah gyal yah stand up?
Batty cock out and dem a push up stomach
And the whole place burn up when the big Benz come up
College gyal say dem love mi swag
Scream offstage when mi throw mi rag
Mi nuh haffi brag, but mi know mi bad
Trailer load fi the Gully God
Trailer lord, trailer lord
We ever fresh we nuh stale a road
Trailer lord, trailer lord
Every ship and every plane a load

[Chorus]
A wha' we waan?
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi da Summer yah
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Bere gyal inna the vehic's
Full suit a Louie V
That mi waan fi da Summer yah
