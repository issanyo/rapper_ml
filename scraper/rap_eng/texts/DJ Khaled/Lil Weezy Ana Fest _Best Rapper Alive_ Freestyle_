(Verse)
Now meet me outside
And you drove while your momma
Chopped in the tub and cousin
In there with her, I don't know about the body
I pick up your hoe, she want some wasabi
I won't (?)
My dope is an army, dope man consignment
Coke is the diet, I hope you applyin'
Niggas be snitches, bitches be lyin'
Niggas who snitches we throw to the lions
No testifyin', you know that's required
Screaming till you give your throat laryngitis
(?)
I told my homie "I know where to find him"
He said "you late, we already got em,'"
"And by the way, it was an honor'
That made my day, I was so proud of him
My bitch (?) from my favorite designer
And a chihuahua
What's the occasion, don't worry about it
Don't fuck with the snakes, (?)
(?) my hair, these hoes is (?)
They leeching my wallet, my pulse and my body
I am the greatest, I am retired, up in the air
Like carbon monoxide, we in the buildin'
Started from outside, dick is the third eye
She got it cock eyed (Run with me)
We'll do a threesome and she get so wet
It could be sea sick then niggas expect
Some times I lean you see i'm in Hi-Def
But while you'll scream at me i'm Weezy F
