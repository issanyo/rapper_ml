[Verse 1 – KeneddyTheDon]
I got my eyes on you
I see you through the crowd
What you gon do when I pull up on you now?
Star-studded, emotional flooding
Reminiscing on days we had then
Conjuring thoughts for forbidden love

[Hook – KeneddyTheDon & Desirée]
You know I get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I’m with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I’m with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 2 – Desirée]
I know you probably think I’m crazy, like I don’t know what I be sayin’
Like I’m just tryna turn you on, you on, boy
But, I’m just tryna get on what I want, boy
I’m only playin’ around, but I can’t get you off my mind

[KeneddyTheDon]
Girl, stop all that frontin’
Get yo ass back in line

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – KeneddyTheDon]
Burned out, cremation
The temptation of getting in your basement
Oo, the sensation
You springing a leak
Let me make it worse
You ignite then explode your passion while I reimburse
This alcohol will do the justice while we cross paths
So, let me apologize in advance
Because my behavior might be too explicit
So, anticipate me tryna get in your face with my pistol stickin’ up
The print on my pants, you can see it well
Conjuring up thoughts of taking you to my hotel
Buss it like you wielding the .44
Like, “Me and My Girlfriend”, fuck the popo
Fuck whatever you was thinking
I don’t need you, but I want you
Creepin’ up behind ya like I haunt you
Put you back in vault, save you for later
Take you back out, pickin’ at your pussy like a vulture

[Hook]
