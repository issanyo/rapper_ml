[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Future, let's get right to it
I don't play about my paper
(DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: Future]
Sippin' my cup with this muddy muddy
When I fuck on these bitches, no lovey-dovey
Got a flood on my wrist, I wear Mello Yello
Had a flood on my wrist, I wear yellow mellow
Check on that chick out the melo
I got that white on that white on the Panamera
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal
I put the racks and the goons on 'em
I got a MAC with a drum on 'em
Soon as the drought hit, we laid on 'em
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
Them Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't

[Verse: Rick Ross]
Rich nigga rituals, Rolls Royces and residuals
Residue in my residence, revenue was so plentiful
Rumors Rozay still be runnin' with all you criminals
Ransom notes and repercussions follow my ridicule
Private charters to Bahamas, that's how we send them through
Two new bitches up in Memphis thatâ€™s just for summer school
A nigga networth at an all-time high
I play for keeps, you just ran cross my mind (ah!)
I own all the things that these niggas plot for
Know they hatin', still resistin', go and cop more
She takin' off her clothes, know that's for a hot boy
Pistols in the lobby, honey on the top floor

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Sippin' my cup with this muddy muddy
When I fuck on these bitches, no lovey-dovey
Got a flood on my wrist, I wear Mello Yello
Had a flood on my wrist, I wear yellow mellow
Check on that chick out the melo
I got that white on that white on the Panamera
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal
I put the racks and the goons on 'em
I got a Mac with a drum on 'em
Soon as the drought hit, we laid on 'em
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
Them Percocet roxies we stay on 'em

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper, yeah!

[Outro: Future]
All of these diamonds I copped them
All of these watches I copped them
All of these Bentleys we copped them
All of these Ghosts and I copped them
All of the Phantoms I copped them
All of these cribs we're coppin'
All of these bitches we coppin'
All of these bitches we coppin'
They know I don't play about that paper
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper, yeah
