[Intro: Demi Lovato & DJ Khaled]
Ooh, yeah
Another one
Ooh, yeah
DJ Khaled

[Vese 1: Demi Lovato]
Some people stand, some people move
Tough times don't last, but tough people do
As long as you've got hope, you'll find your way
There's power in the thoughts that you think, there's power in the words you say

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Like I can, I can, I will, I will
I am, I am, no fear, no fear

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Today, I saw a rainbow in the rain
It told me I can do anything
If I believe, I believe, I believe in me
I believe, I believe, I believe in me
Ooh, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I got the light, inside of me
And I've got no choice, but to let it breathe
As long as there is love, I can make it anywhere I go
If I follow my dreams, I'll end up building a yellow brick road

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Like I can, I can, I will, I will (yeah)
I am, I am, no fear, no fear

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Today, I saw a rainbow in the rain
It told me I can do anything
If I believe, I believe, I believe in me
I believe, I believe, I believe in me

[Bridge: Demi Lovato & DJ Khaled]
I'm living my best life
I am a flower that's blooming, like roses in spring
Living my best life
I am wearing a crown that's only fit for a queen
I'm glorious, victorious
A warrior
Let's ride

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Today, today, I saw a rainbow in the rain, in the rain
It told me I can do anything
If I believe, I believe, I believe in me (I believe)
I believe, I believe, I believe in me (I believe)

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Demi Lovato]
When times got hard, I went harder
Ooh, yeah
The best thing I ever did was believe in me
I believe

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Today, I saw a rainbow in the rain, in the rain
It told me I can do anything
If I believe, I believe, I believe in me
I believe, I believe, I believe in me

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
To succeed, you must believe
We The Best Music
I believe
Another one
A Wrinkle In Time
