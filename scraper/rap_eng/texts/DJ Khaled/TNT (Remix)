[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Hey yo, it's DJ Khaled!
And I'm rocking with my people ¡Mayday!
And this is the TNT remix!
Strange Music, We the Best!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I think I'm Hirohito, Idi Amin Dada
Ayatollah Khomeini, Maximilien, Osama
Am I part of the problem? The subject of the column
I'd probably Jackson Pollock you in the chest for the dollar
The psychotic by-product of a parasite
Triller than the terabyte, staring in the blaring lights
Hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Nights
Invisible civil rights, look at what I've been living like

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Bandwagon massacre, wiretap party line
Guinea pig, gimme this, gimme that with fries on the side
Bitch, I've seen it all before pour in every soul
That's how that shit goes, Adderall tab on the flow
Phantom V is in the cold, wiling out these silly souls
Started easy and is creeping quickly to mama's front door
Show me who ain't a whore, show me an actual pimp
Sold my life at the purchase price in the government list

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
This is the beginning of rise, now follow me into the end
I really don't find it surprising, they trying to set fire again
We set the blaze to ever change talking, backdrafting
Walk across the cracked glass, the papa shot in Baghdad
For every child that can't grasp the dreams we've been having on the regular
Cause the evil around them is so secular
I'll light the match and bring the heat until it turns
Pour my whisky out and let it burn

[Hook]
Let's burn it up in Tunisia, burn this bitch down
Starting up a revolution, take it to a higher ground
Let's burn it up in Tunisia, burn this bitch down
Starting up a revolution, take it to a higher ground
Let's burn it up in Tunisia

[Verse 4: Stevie Stone]
Stevie Stone, Stevie Stone, one of them, wanna be him
Some are checking the summer's them
None of them understand
Feeling like we kicked around, chew me up, spit me out
Underestimate a man, gasoline and doze me down
Protest, violent, food for thought
Blindfolded, wicked ways, turn the cheek, wear them tall
Middle East, bill of lease, finally found my inner beast
Sacrificed my whole life on a cause: get rich

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
I'm just part of an evolution
HiiiPower, come join the revolution
You don't need no application, just your three fingers
Pledge allegiance, life is what you make it, yeah
Light it up, free your mind before the system try to take it
Lock you up, set you down, trying to give you cases
That's what it is, all these wreckers give them cuffs like I'm chasing
Life is like a traffic jam plus I'm standing racism

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Jon Connor]
Television full of illusions here to confuse us
While advertisers getting that paper we getting stupid
And all the while we don't realize how gone the youth is
Transforced they think they choose it, I see resistance as useless
And the truth is I was born where niggas get it on for looking at them wrong
And chicks throw bleach balloon bombs at the prom
When I got word they'd finally killed Osama and Saddam
I’m thinking “all of yall is calm til Vietnam is on your lawn"
I'm from the city where guns get drawn picking up your moms from their salon
And it goes down, this ain't no song, this is my life, right or wrong
We live in a time where wars get made whether we like it or not
And the ones that make them ain't the ones that get shot, now picture that
Just wanted my fair shake at the American dream
Now I lay my head down at night and hear America scream
Look at me now, I'm right here, and it's quite clear
Flint, Michigan's own, Jon Connor, I'm America's nightmare
