[Introduction: DJ Khaled]
I worked my whole life for this
I mean, I've seen so many road blocks
So many devils in my way
But to be honest with you, I seen nobody
I am the best
Listeennn up

It's DJ Khaled, Don Dada, The Big Dog Pitbull
Terror Squadin' a.k.a. the Beat Novacane
A.k.a. who wanna pop off the head get popped off by the realest DJ and that's me
A.k.a. ShitOnNiggas.com, a.k.a. Li-Listennnn
