[Performed by Kent Jones]

Get up, Get up!

You better watch what your saying
Boy don't hurt yourself
I guess I gotta set examples for these niggas guess they don't know how to put in all the work themselves
So I put in all the work myself
I do every beat and every verse myself
Caught you in a frenzy know you heard yourself
Instead of doing music you should learn yourself
What it is! Whats up? Can a nigga just get in touch
I got a big black 'Cedes sprinter bus
Full of y'all if you wanna come with us

Aww, yea she like it like that
When a nigga come back she don't know how to act
Oh naw, I seen her yesterday and she in the mall
With a tall, basketball, player nigga and he started in the Fall
But today she was with me she never called
And tomorrow he gon' be so humbled, naw
He fumbled all, oh no, homie I ain't even worried 'bout your goal
All you niggas stunting man it's getting old
Looking at my shit it already went gold
Oh no, this how it go

Which, one of y'all, coming to the hotel tonight?
They say I like em big I say yea you're right
Stretch marks to the cellulite, stretch marks to the cellulite
Stretch marks to the cellulite
They say I like em big I say yea you're right
Stretch marks to the cellulite

Shhhh! Who gon' ride tonight
It must be you with the tiger stripes
I like them shorts cuz they super short
Call em boy shorts they ain't even got em for boys
Big girl, super thick girl, look taller when you sit girl
Always talking bout you love to fuck
But you hardly take the dick girl
You better watch what you're saying, boy don't hurt yourself
I guess I gotta set examples for these niggas guess they don't know how to put in all the work themselves
So I put in all the work myself
I do every beat and every verse myself
Caught you in a frenzy know you heard yourself
Instead of doing music you should learn yourself

Which, one of y'all, coming to the hotel tonight?
They say I like em big I say yea you're right
Stretch marks to the cellulite, stretch marks to the cellulite
Stretch marks to the cellulite
They say I like em big I say yea you're right
Stretch marks to the cellulite
Shhhh! Who gon' ride tonight
It must be you with the tiger stripes
I like them shorts cuz they super short
Call em boy shorts they ain't even got em for boys

Which, one of y'all, coming to the hotel tonight?
