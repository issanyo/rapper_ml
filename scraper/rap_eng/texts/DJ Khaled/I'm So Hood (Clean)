DJ Khaled, we the best
Who we ***, we the best
The winners I represent the ghetto 'cross the world
And you represent the horde, two hands in the sky

(I'm so hood)
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate

(I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you know what I'm takin' 'bout

I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up
(Hood)
My hood of ***, can you stand up?

(I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood
If you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout

(I-I-I-I'm)
Everybody wanna mother*** know why I
Dress so fly, sit so high
***, I do it for the hood
*** *** *** I do it 'cause I could

Every star on my jeans gleams
4 X on my white tee's
Livin' life like a G that's why
These *** *** *** wanna fight me

Bluck, ain't goin play wit 'em
Brother left to AK hit 'em
Tough *** get *** up
And put on ice for the rest of they life

I'm straight out the hood bro
See that's what I do it for
And my low class ghetto ***
Just renewed my ghetto ***

(I'm so hood)
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate

(I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you know what I'm takin' bout

I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up
(Hood)
My hood of *** can you stand up?

(I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out

You yayo and millions I made em'

I never buy a Phantom, 28's can't fit

They say I'm dead now, they call me high risk
My four bloody goon, lanes make me sick
You're gettin' 3 or 4 birds before we call you rich
I'd like to thank the hood, homie, it's all mad real
