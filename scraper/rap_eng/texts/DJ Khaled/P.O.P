[Intro]
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then

[Verse 1]
Perfection personified, I was powerless in her presence
Acting all possessive, I tried to buy her possessions
Just a peasant, possessed by the power that she possesses
Presented her my heart and she broke it like a profession

[Chorus]
That's P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy

[Verse 2]
She had champagne dreams
Bottles she can't afford
Oh no, not anymore
Now she model for Ford
Met a rich European
Even got her Dior
Gucci, Prada galore
Went and bought out the stores
Eighteen but she's mature
Half a mil' on decor
Dripping sauce
The vintage Porsche parked in front of the porch
Hit a lick, hit a lick, then she hit mission abort
She ain't in love anymore, that's more than he can afford

[Chorus]
I'm like, um
That's the P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy
That's the P.O.P
The P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy

[Verse 3]
Don't be silly, we really out here, you know
I never bring my circle around squares, you know
I stretch the pussy out like a lounge chair, ya hoe
Little brown hairs I go downstairs below
No job, she hit a lick
That's a fucking blowjob with some benefits
Went and got a ass job and some bigger tits
Now she at the Benz dealership, I'm like "get it bih"

[Chorus]
(Ha) the P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
That's the P.O.P. (yeah)
The P.O.P
The power of pussy (that's)
The P.O.P. (man)
The P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)

[Verse 4]
Choose him you let a loser win
Fuck it, he could use a win
You the one that can't afford to lose again
Started to use again
Got me losing friends
Still abusing Henn but did some shit I never do again
See me moving up, show up like she moving in
Ass stupid, head super like the new Karrine
Hallucinogens in my juice and my gin
I'm overdue for a cleanse
I'll overdo it again
You were seduced by a sin
Don't let Lucifer in
She took you for everything
You let her do it again and that's

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then

[Chorus]
(Uh) the P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P. (yeah)
The P.O.P
The power of pussy (that's)
The P.O.P. (man)
The P.O.P
The power of pussy (uh)
The P.O.P
That's the P.O.P
The power of pussy

[Outro]
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then
Do it again and do it do it again and then
