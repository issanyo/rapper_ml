[Verse 1: Vado]
Ambitious, I am vicious
If you watchin' arms in the party you can't miss us
Watches galore, ladies watch us for sure
Top of the floor, Vodka bottles to pour
'Rock wit your boy, we could sell out the Malibu
Your swag powerful, Chanel flower shoe
God damn who be stylin' you
Like I wish I were you tell 'em to look at our view
I love to floss, it's a Harlem thing
If I blow trial they rush the court, no college game
I done dig keys that's not a thing
I run these emcees like Hollis, Queens
With a air thinner you found me
Could tell you don't travel you need a trip out the county
If I'm that nigga then crown me
Denzel would have a problem gettin' women around me

[Hook: Jeremih & Vado]
Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I be on that all day
I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my, bae
You my, bae

[Verse 2: Vado]
On the boardwalk I'm feelin' like "Nucky" Thompson especially
There's always a Gyp Rosetti to test me
Lotta women I ran through
If I want him clipped then that's something I make his man do
Boss talk since day one
Used to play the block where the Roc, Jay n Dame hung
With Big L, Cam, and Ma$e hung
Alotta yay slung was too young hopin' my day come
Now I'm pullin' up with the baddest
So bad that she made the moment a classic
So sad that she killin' 'em in them classics
We call 'em throwaways but baby

[Hook: Jeremih & Vado]
Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I be on that all day
I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my, bae
You my, bae

[Verse 3: Vado]
Tuxedos and bow-ties
Black tie affair yeah we so fly
No matter where we go by

You a hustler? Put your hands up
Ladies I'm lovin' ya won't you stand up

This the take over ya man up!

[Hook: Jeremih & Vado]
Swing my way
