[Intro: DJ Khaled & Yo Gotti]
3 Kings, Roc Nation, King Talk
Ya
We'll never forget these days

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Ay
I'm wrapping gifts like it's Christmas
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us (Don't miss us)
We wrapping gifts like it's Christmas (I am)
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us (Miss us)

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
White Lambo with the bow on it
Traphouse with the mistletoe on it
[?] the good days (Good days)
Until the Grinch come and take the toys away (Ah)
Before Jeezy, I had a snowman
And we got toys from the dopeman
You bought your girl a purse, I bought mine a business
Got a queen lil' homie I'm on some king ish
On the first day of Christmas, my plug gave to me
A whole sledge of snow so the whole hood can eat
A 40 millimeter and a championship ring
The real Roc Nation cause we all 3 Kings

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Yo Gotti]
Never lose faith, never lose hope
Ay Merry Christmas to the whole hood, worldwide
King Talk, Roc Nation

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Ay
I'm wrapping gifts like it's Christmas
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us (Don't miss us)
We wrapping gifts like it's Christmas (I am)
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us (Miss us)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She gave it to me like the box was a gift
I'm from where the toys on a list is a Glock or a fifth
If you tryna light up tree I know the block with the piff
Rudolf want a red nose I know the block with the sniff
I know some Dominicans on Saint Nick (Dimelo)
No Ingles just been Franklins
Sent my nigga North but he ain't flipped
You always see the true colors when the paint chips
Came home the 25th [?] balling
Free throws falling
AND1, three hoes calling
Y'all sing like Carols but we don't snitch
Streets cold it's December keep your heat on bitch
Got the Jordans in the cherry
Ultimately
Them 11's got the whole hood going crazy
Yeah Paper Plane snap, with the family on the side
That's 'cause it's Roc Nation and the family on this side
Ya heard

[Interlude 2: DJ Khaled]
It's a cold world, bundle up
So make shit last for a chinchilla for Christmas
[?]

[Bridge: Yo Gotti]
And it's snowing outside (Ya)
Kids happy, you can see the joy in their eyes
Whole hood turnt, got bikes to ride
Ain't another day like Christmas time (Christmas)

[Chorus]
I'm wrapping gifts like it's Christmas
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us (Don't miss us)
We wrapping gifts like it's Christmas
Every hood hoping Mr. Santa don't miss us
Don't miss us...

[Outro: Fabolous & DJ Khaled]
Yeah
Ay I bought my lady the Ghost for Christmas
It was too big to put under the tree so
We had to put it on a tree outside
Facts!
We The Best, CMG, the family
It's Roc Nation, King Talk
