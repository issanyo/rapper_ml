Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
You say you love me, I say i'm flattered,but
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were almost 6, yeah
Don't mess it up, talking that talk
Cause it's only gonna draw me in ya.
When you say you love me, that make me crazy ugh
Here we go again
Don't go look at me with that look from the side
You really ain't going to win that fuckin fight
You can't reason with me, I'm done being polite!
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Can't You Understand?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Do I need to throw a fit?
Break Down The Door and don't call me old..........
