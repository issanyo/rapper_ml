[Intro: DJ Khaled & Rico Love]
Let's give them something to talk about
This the streets, this Trae Tha Truth
Houston what they do? DJ Khaled
Dade County 305, We The Best Music up in here
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Asshole by nature, tell them bitches remember
I'm a hunnid or better, chain cold as december
Bitch I'm packaging weather, talking snow like the winter
If I don't eat I send gorillas and invite you for dinner
My attitude say fuck who ever, these niggas who with me plexin'
Haters get VIP, so the whole clip at your section
Send a fully automatic pis' at your discretion
Bullets needs guns to bitches fly without no direction
Realest nigga in it, want the title? Nigga take your place
Yeah I'm on that shit that have this niggas try'na break your face
They know I'm a problem in the streets, I never play it safe
Chopper and it's 911, have a ticket off the safe
Better than nothing greater, born first never later
Give 'em half a clip, yellin' out ABN renegator
They do what I tell them, I tell them run up inside a hater
In the hood like a mechanic, flush 'em like a radiator

[Hook: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on
I do this, come on
I do this for real, I do this for real
I do this for real, I do this for real
I do this for real, I do this for real
I do this for real

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Aye walk in here hundred deep, bought the bar 100 flick
Nigga don't want it with me, try'na say none of that
Got a problem with me? When you see me we can handle that
Find out where the cameras at, then we let that hammer splatt (blatt blattt)
Crack dealers, certified trap niggas
We wreck rap niggas, recon now where you at nigga
It's Hustle Gang known to let that muzzle bang
Make you change your music, move these cocaine and other thangs
I don't play with nothin' but a long cane
Run upon a big nigga, lay him out the long way
Don't play with cyber thugs no matter what my phone say
Well, unless you catch a nigga on the wrong day
Called the bitch, you called the bitch
[?] you talking shit
Run upon you with that AR, oh you say you own shit
All of y'all better get duckin' while I'm bustin' at
Fully automatic-tic-tic-tic-tic, watchu lookin' on

[Hook]
