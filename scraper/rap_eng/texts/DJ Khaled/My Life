[Intro: Akon & DJ Khaled]
Oh oh oh!
DJ Khaled!
Konvict Muzik, oh oh
Cash Money, Young Money, let's go

[Hook: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Hook: Akon & B.o.B]
My life, my life (my life, my life)
My life, my life (yeah, my life, my life)
My life, my life (my life, my life)
You want a taste of my life?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, they wanna taste that rapper life
But the road of fame usually spoils the appetite
We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Huh, not everything is lavished life
But in the mirror, all I see is all the nights I had to fight
And so I run it, all I had to sacrifice
But now I got the money, I get everything for half the price
Damn

[Verse 2: Akon]
You know Khaled, everybody wants the good life
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Nobody really wanna pay the price
Ayo, ayo, ayo
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
This might take a little longer
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
It will only make you stronger

[Hook: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Hook: Akon]
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?

[Verse 3: Akon]
They all wanna make it up to the top
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Khaled, they don't wanna give up everything they've got
Ayo, ayo, ayo
No I can't, no I can't, na na na na
This might take a little longer
No pain, no gain, na na na na
It will only make you stronger

[Hook: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Hook: Akon]
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?
