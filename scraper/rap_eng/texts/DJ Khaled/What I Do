[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Just in case you forgot, we go by The Runners
Hol' up, hol' up, Chris Brown, this what we do, we do this

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad cause they can't, yeah
Feelin' like I can't lose and when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do, it's what I do, hey, it's what I do

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Everywhere I go they show me love so I give it back
Throw a couple stacks up in the air cause I'mma get it back
See something sexy up in here, I'mma bring it back
They keep on runnin' back, they keep on comin' back
Everybody knows CB, see me sittin' in the front row, Playoffs
Stuntin' with my J's on and it's all for them haters, yeah
Yeah, we get into that quap boy, my money to long boy
We do this for fun boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad cause they can't, yeah
Feelin' like I can't lose and when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do, it's what I do, hey, it's what I do
Ey ey, it's what I do

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Single once again, I'm 'bout to go where I never been
Gone with the wind cause that other ish irrelevant
We can get it in, I mean get it in
And I got stamina so don't forget to bring a friend
Nah bring ten but they gotta be tens
Now that's a hunnid them, let The Runners in
Yeah, swag heavy like an elephant
My CD's selling out you ain't married to the game, you celibate

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad cause they can't, yeah
Feelin' like I can't lose and when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do, it's what I do, hey, it's what I do
Ey ey, it's what I do

[Verse 3: Plies]
I keep cash on me, no black cards
They don't know what them is, I deal with hood broads
That's a .9 on me, that's no iPod
You want my watch homie, gimmie five bricks for it
I got the Maserati, I had to lick for it
When all money talk, that's what I paid for it
He say I bought fleet, and all 'em mine
Four broads with me, and all 'em dimes
Six chains on me, and all 'em shine
I got my bread right, feel like I'm 6'9
Ain't just hot in mine, I'm hot in every city
She want a pretty boy, I brought Chris Breezy with me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad cause they can't, yeah
Feelin' like I can't lose and when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do, it's what I do, hey, it's what I do
Ey ey, it's what I do
