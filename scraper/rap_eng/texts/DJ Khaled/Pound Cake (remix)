[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
They never said winning was easy
Some people can't handle success
I can
I know what it comes with
Some people can't handle it
I can

[Verse 2: Alex]
You thought it was a game?
Not anymore

Yeah, I can handle success
Even when I'm put through stress
Don't try me, I'll put that to the test
This girl at school, she tryna talk mess
I see you shakin', takin' that exam
Meanwhile I'm goin' ham
Stackin' that paper, yeah girl
You can smell me later
Don't try me, I'll fry you
I got so many birds, I got drafted by the Pelicans
Shoutout to Abram, that guy nice
After this track, it'll be so silent you can hear the mice
Shoutout to the haters, I'll fire you all
Call you s'mores
I know you guys want more
I can handle success
Don't talk back to me, I'll put you to rest
Like it's past your bedtime
I'm ill when I spit these rhymes
