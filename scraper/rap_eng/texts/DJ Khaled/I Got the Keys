[Chorus: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Niggas always askin' me the key
'Til you own your own you can't be free
'Til you're on your own you can't be me
How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionaires
We gon' take it there, I swear
You gon' think a nigga's psychic
You ain't seen nothin' like this
I should probably copyright this
I promise they ain't gonna like this

[Chorus: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Radar, radar on, bitches ain't even on my radar
Radar, radar on, on, you ain't on my radar
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I got a bag for lawyers, like, "Fuck your charges!"
Hop out the courtroom, like, "What charges?"
Big pimpin' on your court steps
Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet
Y'all know it's one of one
Soon as you hear that uh, uh, uh
Y'all know the difference right
From rap facts and fiction, right?
Real life I'm like HOV, real life I'm life goals
In real life they're like me? In real life I'm like, "No."
My swag different, that bag different
My wife Beyonc√©, I brag different
My baby Blue (What else?)
I dream in color (What else?)
That's too much flavor (What else?)
I don't rap to suckas (Ha!)
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
I only talk special cloth
Said I only talk special, ah!

[Chorus: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys (Wraith talk)
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Radar, radar on, bitches ain't even on my radar
Radar, radar on, on, you ain't on my radar
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Future]
I got the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys to all success!
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We the best!
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
Roc Nation! Freebandz!
Secure the bag alert
Alert, alert, alert, alert, alert, alert
Alert, alert, alert, alert, we got 'em alert

[Chorus: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
