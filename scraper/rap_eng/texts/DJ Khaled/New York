[Intro: DJ Khaled, Dre, & Ja Rule]
This Is
DJ Khaled
This is
I'm about unity, man!
This is
Gotta love it
Greetings from Miami-Dade County, Florida
This is, this is, this is, this is, this is
Listennn!
This is, this is, this is, this is, this is
Ohhhh, New York!
Let's go Listennn!

[Chorus 1: Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, & Jadakiss]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(A-HAAAAAA!)
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side)
D-Block!
(Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side)
(Uh, yeah, uh yeah)
(Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
(A-HAAAAAA!)
New York is back!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I did was hold on to the pieces 'til the puzzle came together
Before it all got hype
I was in the core of the Apple before it got ripe
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I'm not the best, dog, then I'm one of them
Listen, I'm a different kind of boss
I'm cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody followin' protocol
The money's only good 'til you blow it all
Stacking ever since
Guliani knocked John Gotti (what?)
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
Wtih no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
To blow breath back in it

[Chorus 2: Jadakiss (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
New York is back!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Muh'fucka I'm the heart and the soul of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin' the block at the height of a beef!
(Coca!)
(Crack crack crack crack crack crack)
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yeah, that's my backdrop whenever I speak
I know a lot of y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
(Owwww!)
Joe's the business, ask about me
In the middle of the desert and they still can't drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that New York shit
You seen Weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come up with
Then I'ma have to hit 'em, make a little breads often

[Chorus 3: Fat Joe (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
New York is back!

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
New York, New York, nigga, never went nowhere
I just took off a couple of years
But now I'm back on my day-to-day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gon' tell New York "Time's up"? Flavor Flav?
Cause as much as things change it remains the same
And you can give me the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mosque
An inspiration; the inception, the art
Of hip-hop was born
The rap game was formed
From niggas that's dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star; Joe, Jada or Ja?
So close but so far
So many with no start
I can't believe 50 Cent and NY fell off
Then LA came back, then South is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK!

[Chorus 4: Ja Rule (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
New York is back!
