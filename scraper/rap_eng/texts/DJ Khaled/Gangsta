[Hook]
It's G-A-N-G-S-T-A
That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all knooooow)
That's how it be when you see me
That's how it be in NYC (Y'all knooooow)
If it's me it's got to be
If it's me it's got to be
G-A-N-G-S-T-A (Y'all knooooow)

[Verse One]
I'm still living la vida loca
With wholesale prices on weed and coca
For the hustlers, for the customers, nigga trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)
They love me just because
I'm in the Gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta shit
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and ho-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up, glistenin chrome, burning green like "what's good?"

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's 'cuz I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
'Cuz we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like the Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag, bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute like Shyne
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my keep
My nameâ€™ll get you coke, weed, and burners cheap
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now (y'all knooooow)
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up
(It's a gangsta party)
