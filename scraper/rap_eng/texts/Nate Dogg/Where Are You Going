[Chorus]
People where are you going?
People where are you going?

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to play the game
But nobody wants to lose
I see my people die every day
That's why I sing the blues
Now tell me who wants to roll with me
Take a look at my world
I see some problems
Maybe you can help me solve them
Turn boys to men
And make women from girls
I see my loved ones turning to drugs
Almost every day I lose another one
Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they don't know

[Chorus]
People where are you going?
People where are you going?

[Verse 2]
What if I could save my nation
What if I could save my friends
If I had the whole worlds attention
What if people were really listening
I would tell them that I'm no good without them
I would tell them together we can stand
Another message to brothers, colors bother
I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town
Somebody tell me please

[Chorus]
People where are you going?
People where are you going?

[Bridge]
Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they don't know

[Chorus]
People where are you going?
People where are you going?
