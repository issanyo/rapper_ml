[Intro: Obie Trice]
Every man determined his definition of realness
What's real to him
Everybody's got their own definition of gangsta, man
Okay, this is my definition of gangsta

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Surprise motherfuckers
You thought I never would arise motherfuckers
It's Obie Trice motherfuckers
Look in the eyes of a real guy
I ain't got time for lies
Niggas frontin like they lyin
Nigga ya not tough
Decease the bluff
These streets is too heated up for you to front
Dre laced the beat
Heated up for you to bump
Real name no gimmicks, give my niggas what they want
Fuck the image of the blunt
That ain't rap dog
Be who you wanna be but let it be fact dog
We'll never let a nigga tell you how you should act dog
Specially when you're fuckin wit automatic gats, dog
These niggas ain't playin
I'm sayin
I'm sprayin
I do my dirty work wit my hands
I'm a man
Layin a nigga down, he advance
You fuckin wit my plans
I'm lookin for the tooth

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin there's a love I can hate
Cuz it's a thin line
Walk around with my chest out
Like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap
Before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)
Real G's anticipate
They got to have mine
All the hoes shoppin me out
Say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth
Cuz they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Now when Obie's up to bat
They asked Obie
How you cope wit dat
Copesetically, man
I Kobe Bryant rap
I'm so defiant that
The lungs uninviting my rhyme
I swear I'm outta my mind sometimes
Out on the grind, my kind
Nickel and dime niggas we ain't rich yet
We on the corner with a 40 and a biscuit
Ready for bitch shit
Have you drinkin
We ain't got good sense
My hood so tense
Niggas so dense
I see through the life you invent (fake-ass niggas)
Slow up on how you niggas vent
You niggas ain't representin shit
I represent school crowd killas
Detroit nigga
My nigga what
The realest
Exploit niggas
My nigga what
What's the point in avoidin your feelins
You niggas fillas
You drillas
You a lyrics motherfuckers
Real life experiences
Eminem gave the clearance
So I here to show you niggas brialliance
Build it
Shady marine no civilian
O Trice you fuckin wit a real one

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin there's a love I can hate
Cuz it's a thin line
Walk around wit my chest out
Like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap
Before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)
Real G's anticipate
They got to have mine
All the hoes shoppin me out
Say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth
Cuz they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
This is what the streets done to me
Hungry
Gun on me
Hopes high only keep change up community
Give it up in unity
Raise future me's
You look in my eyes that's the dream Obie see
Man it seems
It's as easy as the rhyme Obie brings
But my eye shows things intervene
All or in between
It's like losin my team
Losin my freedom, losin my mind, and the being
The being I'm a being
Graduated from rights of beings
To a Benz
Congratulated on life's irenes
On your biatch
I done came to far to go backwards
My aim to extreme for y'all

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin there's a love I can hate
Cuz it's a thin line
Walk around wit my chest out
Like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap
Before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)
Real G's anticipate
They got to have mine
All the hoes shoppin me out
Say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth
Cuz they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out
Look in my eyes (look in my eyes)

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Look in my eyes man
It ain't shit but real talk over here nigga
I would never send you elsewhere
I got hair on my nuts nigga
Grown man shit
That's how a nigga get into clubs nigga
When I ain't got no ID
Flash my nuts on they ass
They walk me right in nigga
Ha ha ha ha ha
Yea
Obie Trice
