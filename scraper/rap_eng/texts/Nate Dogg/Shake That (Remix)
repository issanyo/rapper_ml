[Intro: Eminem + (Bobby Creekwater)]
Woo! Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losin' control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby creek!)

[Verse 1: Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn', I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin' me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin' everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin' to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get'cha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party – turn the music up!
Let's get it started – go 'head and shake your butt!
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, everyday she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Interlude: Eminem]
Obie Trice!

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious, full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch?
True that, I had a few, Obie rollin' with brews
And Nathaniel annually knockin' the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit, then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Shady – you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie came to party
You better ask somebody

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady!
