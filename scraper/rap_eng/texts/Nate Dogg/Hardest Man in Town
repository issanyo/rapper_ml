[Verse 1]
Will the hardest man please stand, the homie stood right up
Sagging pants, gat in hand, the nigga was a nut
Looney low key, O.G., been banging from the jump
Dressed in all black, ready to jack, and he still don't give a fuck
A friend of mine, he used to be, before I got caught up
He used to roll with me, way back in '93, when I was broke as fuck
Be prepared to blast, that's all that he ask, if he's to ride with you
We gonna make some cash, and dash, you can toss him when you're through

[Chorus]
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around

[Verse 2]
Little big man, don't you see me lyin' here - pick me up, if you dare
I'll make your life easier, cause I'll be pumpin' fear
Disrespect, you don't have to take
If you see him comin', just wave me in his face
But you ain't the only one that got a friend like me
So hurry up, let's go, I'm kind of tired of being broke
I know you gotta get paid, I can show you the way
So take me home, polish the chrome
Load me up, and put me to his dome
I got a lot work to do, so toss me and be gone

[Chorus]
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now
You're a big man now

[Bridge]
I told you once before I'm pumping fear
Nobody's gonna step to you, let them know I'm here
And if you have questions in the corner of your mind
Pull the trigger, and leave your questions behind

[Chorus]
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man in town
The hardest man around
