("Blitzkrieg Bop")
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
(Repeat)

(Urge Overkill's "Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon" from "Pulp Fiction")
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll meet a man

(Warren G Featuring Nate Dogg's "Regulate" from "Above the Rim")

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

("Teenage Lobotomy")
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy

(Madonna's "I'll Remember" from "With Honors")
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

("I Wanna Be Sedated")
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated

(Stone Temple Pilots' "Big Empty" from "The Crow")
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

("Beat on the Brat")
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat

(Elton John's "Can You Feel The Love Tonight (End Title)" from "The Lion King")

Can you feel the love tonight?
It's where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

("Blitzkrieg Bop")
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
