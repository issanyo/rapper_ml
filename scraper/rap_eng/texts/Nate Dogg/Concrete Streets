[Hook]
I'm from the jungle with the concrete streets
You don't wanna rumble wit the real O.G.'s
Man I'll plant ya like a chronic seed
And ya girl done ran away wit me
I can show you how to catch these freaks
I can show you how to beat these streets
I can show you how to crack that safe
Let me show you how to break that bank

[Nate Dogg]
Ain't a damn thang changed
Still rollin on Dana Danes
Still packin steel claimin DPG
I always keep my thang
Always got weed on my brain
Always got a dime piece wit me
I'm gone let yo roll call
I'm gone ball till I fall
Keep it gangsta just for all of ya'll
Be what you want me to be, Nate D, O, double G
Bangin from the west to the east

[Hook]

[Nate Dogg]
No need to fight it baby
I know you want it lady
I can tell by the way you watch me
I like the way that you walk
I like the way that you talk
Ooh what that accent does to me
Yeah I still claim 213
Yeah I still bang DPG
Hang wit Nate, Snoop, and Warren G
Yeah I got hoes that love me
Got gangstas bangin my beats
I got hoes from here to overseas

[Hook]

[Nate Dogg]
I need a gangsta lady
One from around the way
I need a girl that likes to play everyday
She said her friend wants to see
She said her friend is nasty
I say you get your friend and come right away

[Hook 2X]
