[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, yeah, I'm burnin' it up
D-P-G-C, you should be turnin' it up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah, we hookin' back up
And when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
Cuss homies, thug homies, yeah, they givin' it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party fo' sho'
Slip my girl a 44 and she crip in the back do'
Chick is lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motha, just a-swangin' my hair
Trick quit talkin', crip-walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some grip and take this smoke on this jet
Out o' town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if you happen to get cracked, trick shut your trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S, you'll be relievin' your stress

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Da da da da da
