Right this way, ma'am. Lockdowns on the other side of this cafeteria here. Just stick close to me
Anybody looks at you strange, you just let me know, OK?
OK
Hold on a second. Y'all just shut the Hell up. You want a 115 be a lockdown all week?
Yeah, that's what I thought. Right this way, ma'am. It's right this way. Welcome to Death Row
This is the last stop for all the scum of the Earth
These people ain't worth a damn in here
Oh, here's your guys vacation spot right here
Step right in
By myself?
Aww, don't worry about it, we always keep chains on these Death Row boys and plus I'll be right outside here
Mr. Nate Dogg, may I call you Nate? I just wanna ask you a few questions, do you mind if I record this conversation?
No, I don't mind at all
I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but I'm a pretty big fan of yours and I've been following your career since you were sentenced to Death Row
Right
And I've noticed a lot of people trying to jump on the G-Funk bandwagon, um...
Haha, that's right
...proclaiming to be from the G-Funk generation. How would you like to address that?
Well, you gotta do what you gotta do to eat
Hehe, Nate, I hope no offense is takin by this next statement, but it doesn't look like you'll be around much longer and in my opinion when you're gone, it's going to be very difficult to ever get the true meaning of G-Funk. So as a last request for the millions of people who love and respect your music, could you please give us the true definition of G-Funk
