[Intro/Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Round and round we go [2X]
Round and round we gooooooo
Round and round we go
Round and round

[Nate Dogg]
What goes up [echoes] must come down
What goes round [echoes] comes back around
Stronger lover [echoes] it can not be found
Why do we [echoes] keep on goin round and round and round

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
In and out [echoes]
Girl I love the way you sex me without doubt
The way you scream and shout! [echoes]
Almost makes me explode just thinkin about it
The way you call my name [echoes]
Can easily make me forget all my woes
So I won't complain [echoes]
I'll be careful not to step on nobody's toes

[Chorus w/ a few ad libs]

[Nate Dogg (unnamed female harmonizer)]
Round and round makin me dizzy
And we can be how we used to be
We used to talk but we hardly speak
I wanna stay but you're pushing me
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
