Guard: Right this way, ma'am. Lockdown's on the other side of this cafeteria here, just stick close to me. Anybody looks at you strange, you just let me know, OK?
Woman: OK
Guard:Hold on a second. Y'all just shut the Hell up. You want a 115 be a lockdown all week? Yeah, that's what I thought. Right this way, ma'am. It's right this way. Welcome to Death Row, This is the last stop for all the scum of the Earth. These people ain't worth a damn in here. Oh, here's your guy's vacation spot right here. Step right in
Woman: By myself?
Guard: Aww, don't worry about it, we always keep chains on these Death Row boys and plus I'll be right outside here
Woman: Mr. Nate Dogg, may I call you Nate? I just wanna ask you a few questions, do you mind if I record this conversation?
Nate: No, I don't mind at all
Woman: I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but I'm a pretty big fan of yours and I've been following your career since you were sentenced to Death Row
Nate: Right
Woman: And I've noticed a lot of people starting to jump on the G-Funk bandwagon, um...
Nate: Haha, that's right
Woman: ...proclaiming to be from the G-Funk generation. How would you like to address that?
Nate: Well, you gotta do what you gotta do to eat
Woman: Hehe, Nate, I hope no offense is taken by this next statement, but it doesn't look like you'll be around much longer and in my opinion, when you're gone, it's going to be very difficult to ever get the true meaning of G-Funk. So as a last request for the millions of people who love and respect your music, could you please give us the true definition of G-Funk
