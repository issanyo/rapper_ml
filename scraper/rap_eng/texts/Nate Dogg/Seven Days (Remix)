[Intro: Nate Dogg]
Oh no! Look at who they let in the back door
It's been 7 days so let's roll
From the UK to Brooklyn they know
Craig David, Mos Def, and Premo
When we step on the mic we too cold
This remix might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def a.k.a. Yaasin Bey]
Now look alive and clap your hands to it
Sexy mamis in the house, shake and dance to it
My hard head's in the place - don't act stupid
It's not Craig and Big Mos can't do it
Get that ass moving, from the front to back to it
Putting that thumping back to it
It's that music to set it off and get the mass movin
Yo tell them 'bout that shorty you came through with

[Craig David]
I met this girl in the subway, walking my way
It must have been my day
Seem like the perfect match for me, so she said to me
"Craig can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you, but I feel so good.."
Girl I can make you feel real hot tonight
So I said baby we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again do it again till you call my name
Girl you got me insane
Can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, make you moan
Make you groan, all night long, yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when you're all alone

[Hook: Craig David](x2)
Cause it was "ooh" on Monday
And it was (two!) on Tuesday
And it was "ooh" on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to Sunday

[Verse 2: Craig David]
Page 2: look at my girl
Come a little closer, gimme a twirl
Put my hands on your body cause you're on my mind
On my mind, think about you all the time
Girl can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you but I feel so hot
I want to love you baby
Do all the little things that I want to do
Or we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again, do it again, til you call my name
Girl you got me insane
Can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, make you moan
Make you groan, all night long, yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when you're all alone

[Hook: Craig David](x2)
Cause it was "ooh" on Monday
And it was (two!) on Tuesday
And it was "ooh" on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to Sunday

[Verse 3: Mos Def a.k.a. Yaasin Bey]
Listen, little mamma you can kill all the drama
Girl you know you gonna be here til tomorrow
Probably stay after that, later on and maybe play after that
Get it on and lay straight after that, it's like an natural fact
When you see me you know how to react
It don't matter anywhere that we at it's game time
Move your waistline shook your tail further to the bassline
Moving in the same time like we got the same sign
Peep game, it's pro ball I'm pretty laced to my part
I go off like Biz Mark
Yeah I talk big talk but carry a big staff
And stay down for laying it down your big ass
I'm know I'm wrong, but damn ma I got to tell for true
Tell the world like I tell it to you
That's it's just a mere mention of you
You make me get in the mood
Mos and Craig Dave get in the groove, it's like

[Hook: Craig David](x4)
Cause it was "ooh" on Monday
And it was (two!) on Tuesday
And it was "ooh" on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to Sunday
