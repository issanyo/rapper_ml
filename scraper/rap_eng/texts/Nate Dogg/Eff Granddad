[Hook: Nate Dogg]
You just mad 'cause ya ass is old
The first thing ya do is just pick up the phone
Lethal Interjection livin' next to ya home
Motherfuckin' grandpa old nigga its on

[Verse 1: Thugnificent]
Lethal Interjection versus one old nigga
He picked up the phone now my finger's on the trigga'
Snitchin' ain't the thing to do, so now me and my crew
Gonna show the block how to handle this fool
He just hatin' cause we went from rags to riches
To baddest bitches
Somebody need to ask the snitches
Why they talking to police
No justice no peace
My house is payed for, no rent, no lease

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Dis ol' mayne
He played fool
Now his ass is grass for dropping dimes on my crew
The only reason that I pack a strap
Is that I knew this old nigga was foul like hack-a-Shaq

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
This is the type of heat
That when they start playing it
Old folks should get they ass whooped for actin' all gay n' shit
(Old ass nigga!)
You done crossed the line
See it don't cost a dime
Somebody toss my nine (I'm 'bout to blow his mind!)

[Hook x2]
