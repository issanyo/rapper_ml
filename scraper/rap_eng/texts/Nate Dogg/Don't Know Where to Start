Yeah...
Ooh...

Midnight at the valet
He already knows gotta keep me up from
Headin out to security
Holdin' back the crowd as he opens the door
Give the fellas ? haterade
To form a group and even get through the door
And it's ok cos it's the weekend
And it's a party for sure

All the shortys are here tonight
Just left the shop and my ? is tight
I might not dance but baby I might
Everything's gonna be alright, alright

There's a couple of friends up in here
The music's bangin' loud and clear
The temperature's risin', just about to pop
There's so much goin' on, I don't know where to start

I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start

Inside I see Lakers
And Clippers, everybody says Ho
Cos they know I got ? rings and I handle that
? shake you from Go
Thank God it's Friday
And a fresh one just poured me a drink
Now I know what they meant
When they said it's good to be the shit

All the shortys are here tonight
Just left the shop and my ? is tight
I might not dance but baby I might
Everything's gonna be alright

There's a couple of friends up in here (here)
The music's bangin' loud and clear (loud and clear)
The temperature's risin', just about to pop
There's so much goin' on, I don't know where to start

I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start

Tonight I broke my way in
I ain't gettin' here late
Look at all these fine ladies
I'm about to go blind
Look at all that dirt she's packin'
I'm about to go ?
And I'm glad I brought some plastic
I can love her, I can love her
I can regain my composure
I don't wanna look like Rover
????? is over
? my contact this time

Cos tonight, I'm living out my fantasy
My own little nasty world
Cos tonight, I gotta find me a freak
My own little nasty girl

There's a couple of friends up in here
The music's bangin' loud and clear
The temperature's risin', just about to pop
There's so much goin' on, I don't know where to start

There's a couple of friends up in here
The music's bangin' loud and clear
The temperature's risin', just about to pop
There's so much goin' on, I don't know where to start

I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start
