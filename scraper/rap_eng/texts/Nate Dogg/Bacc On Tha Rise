[Intro: Tha Dogg Pound]
Bigger than life
Dogg pound gangstas
Me and that nigga Daz (wassup' Daz?)
What's up with you man? We back doin' it up again man you know what I'm sayin'?
Bitch, Snoop Dogg ride [?]
Super fly Nate Dogg, lets ride homie!


[Verse 1: Tha Dogg Pound]
Life without the Pound was turned upside down
Had to take a look around, take two steps out
My body just to take a look at what I'm in now (now)
What I've been through (through), what I've been around
We inflatable, back up on that mission where we left off
Takin' no losses you'll be lying in the coffin
Flossin' the heaters, selling two-seater
You know me and my homies stay g [?]
Me and my nigga Daz hit the Glock and the mass
Cock and we blast, cocked and popped and we stashed, look (look, look, look, look)
[?] it's brand new 2005 shit, the movement Dogg Pound gangsta [?]
And Daz, Kurupt, Kurupt, and Daz
Back on the block from corners to ass
Stay ready to smash
The dogs are B-A-C-C, strapped [?] shell-shocked
From a handheld Glock, who else to get popped?
Lay ya' flat, bitches when I [?] from my nine-millimeter RAT-A-TAT-TAT
Nigga serious, and I'm seriously ridin'
[?] is gonna take effect, pushin' and slidin'
That boy's sharp, floatin' like a arc in the wind
[?]


[Hook: Tha Dogg Pound]
(You know) Gangsters [?] rise
(You know) Dogg Pound gangsters til' the day that we die
We make it happen, keep it crackin', money stackin', liquor packin', just ridin' through the streets on these [?]
(You know) Gangsters [?] rise
(You know) Dogg Pound gangsters til' the day that we die
We make it happen, keep it crackin', money stackin', liquor packin', just ridin' through the streets on these [?]


[Verse 2: Tha Dogg Pound]
I keep it crackin', keep it jumpin', never slippin', cuz' I'm bumpin'
If you're funny got the nigga yeah we might get up to somethin'
Compete down, rolled up, stocked out, tricked up
Dogg pound, homie, ya'll up in the cut
I terror the mayhem, it's tragedy cut
Blue mass, blue bloods, I'ma [?]
Nigga ride on this West Coast gangbang expedition
Worldwide on a gangsta mission
Daz, Kurupt, Kurupt, and Daz
Back on the ass, first [?] up, first to get smashed
I got a ounce of some bomb
Rode through Vietnam
Got some hash in the stash
Orange and chocolate-tied
That 2005, orange and chocolate-tied
That shit that put elephants to sleep on the side
I got a caprice, me and super fly price' D-A-Z, big Snoop, Nate rage, and Warren G
Takin' trips to Thailand, all sorts of islands
Doin' movies, bitches in jacuzzis (all hood)
