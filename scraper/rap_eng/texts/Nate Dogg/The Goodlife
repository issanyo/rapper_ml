(All star, baby)
Young, quick, see
(F U B U)
Lately, all I see is DPG
(QB, LBC niggas)
When I turn the radio on, keep hearing me
(All day, everyday)
Living the good life, good life
Uh, huh, good life
(Braveheartz)
Sure as the world is turning round and round
(Shit is real, yo)
There's these niggas, bitches, snitches trying to bring you down
(Fucked up)
But I don't know why I mention
And if I don't pay no attention, I'm cool
(Real niggas do real things)
(Real niggas do real things)
Sure as my chronic is the best in town
Those who tripping, slipping, listen, we ain't stopping now
(Can't stop)
We won't even pause, y'all can lick my balls
(Bitches)
We living the good life, good life, good life
(Living the good life, baby)
Young, quick, see
(Come on, come on)
Lately all I see is DPG
(Nate Dogg)
When I turn the radio on, keep hearing me
(Still, still, still)
Living the good life, good life, uh huh good life
(We living the life)
It ain't nothing but a paper chase
But even when ya paper straight
Every stage just another way to see cake
But niggas still gotta die hate
Well fuck it, I'ma do it 'cause the streets put me to it
See y'all niggas is late
See it's big face, big living, big dogs and big pimping
Game played with nothing but precision
Money, cars and women
See niggas hating 'cause they on the outside
Wishing they could find a way in it
You see the rims spinning all black tinted
With the niggas who'll bring it to ya brain
If it's fucking with change
Fifty-four, nigga, remember the name
Ritz, glitz, only when we empty clips
And dismember your brain
'Cause I remember pain, gain pain, this winner reign
But now it's high tech out here in the center lane
See we got the world respecting the slang
The good life, hit the studio, the club, straight to the plane
Young, quick, see
(Come on, come on)
Lately all I see is DPG
(Nate Dogg)
When I turn the radio on, keep hearing me
(Still, still, still)
Living the good life, good life, uh huh good life
(We living the life)
Yo, yo, yo
Pass you cowards, classical rap mix form power
Yasser Arafat, I'm storming with lead showers
And I'm murderous, common is formerly Nastradamus
I'm going for the top regardless
Pretty Boy Floyd, the rotten tooth king
Ghosts of my dead friends linger
I toast to you, lover, blunts lit, wish I was hitting
Cock back, four pound, let six in the air
Rock that raw sound, getting wet to this year
'Cause of the projects Hannibal Lec, hand on my tech
In front the White House, my ice out demanding respect
Bravehearting to the grave, darling wavin' my sterling
From out the black Bentley, it's off, spray 'til y'all falling
East to West Coast balling
Nate Dogg, Nas and Kurupt, liven it up, dimes in the cut
Sizing us up, y'all wanna fuck, gin and tonic my cup
And we live the good life, still chronic it up
Young, quick, see
(Come on, come on)
Lately all I see is DPG
(Nate Dogg)
When I turn the radio on, keep hearing me
(Still, still, still)
Living the good life, good life, uh huh good life
(We living the life)
