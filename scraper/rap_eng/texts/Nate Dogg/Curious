[Snoop] Bow wow!

You so crazy (wha-what?)
You so crazy (so be it)
Back up in the heezy baby

[Snoop] Doggy's Angels, y'all so crazy

[Verse One]
See some of y'all bitches think it's all a game
California don't stop 'til the motherfucker drop
Don't really need a (?), I guess I'm pump from the lips
Niggas get scared, from the style, they hear it
Start a new religion, everybody chant "Go"
Let's light up the bar, everybody take a toast
Smoke ya brains out, (?) seen you on the ride
What?  Spottin my life, then I cut out the branch
The branch, shouldn't be, bitch I'm livin kosher
You just mad, cause the whole world lovin me
I don't give a fuck cause the world don't give a fuck
You ain't no leprechaun nigga don't press ya luck
Heffer is you crazy?  You done lost yo' mind
You need some real lessons, your style done went blind
Then he got the calculator hood cause you could diss me
But mediocre's, put this clip, set clips

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Back up in the heezy baby, Doggy's Angels, y'all so crazy
To feet to the beat, to the freak to the weed
Baby girl you gotta heat for the street
And we back up in the heezy baby, Doggy's Angels, y'all so crazy
It's, yo', people, toes, bangin on this punkass hoes

[Verse Two]
This one is goin out, to all my true bitches
Fuck the so called L.B.'s finest when we givin up phone calls
Catch me hood, bitch I stay blowin good
Cause I'ma r(?) the squad chipped up like wood
Keep 'em independant state cause they scared of us
Homies in the air touch us like they cellular
Niggas comin by the block, tryna ride the cops
Migrain from my chain when I hit the block
Toguns, been funs, west coast, style young
V.I.C. in the club, roll bitches, why Blood?
No ki, sucker free, eastside, L.B
Dog's Angels, simply keeps the CP3
Being, the quick clip from the twitch of my hips
Gotta line dog nigga beggin me park the hips
So fast, so quick, I got 'em screamin "Oh shit"
Don't get it any twist, this that bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three](singer)
D Angels where it's at, is the Los Angeles
(The regulators like to piss off the fresh camera this)
Nobody leave the it's been corney yet
Where my homies at, holla back, got the proper, where the collar at?
Then you follow that nigga (Ohh, fake drama)
Callin me included, of the zeros, the three comas
Where's it soundin like Gotti like, press they not
(Ma, three strait bubbles, dress the murder rest)
Good anyway, nigga paid big to keep rollin
Rich, Puffy know chips ain't mean shit
Dogg House is where my niggas do produce niggas in
Filthy gang major, the cowards just can't produce it
Double hard late (Y'all gon' keep rollin)
A certain level manditory element I kept persuing
Reppin for my niggas, brokin wit figgaz
(And my bitches startin to struggle, push the heights)

[Chorus]
