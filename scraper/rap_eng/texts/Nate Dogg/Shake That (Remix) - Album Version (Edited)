There she goes shaking that **** on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control, Bobby Creek

I'm on the [Incomprehensible] in the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm gone so she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known

I'm from Atlanta so southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and **** for any ****
But I came here to get on goose and Tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice in your caboose

Sippin' everything from white **** to deuce juice
With nothin' to gain but my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is Snoop too

But the [Incomprehensible] been around, my drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around if she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I hit you in ya, come ****

Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad **** last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I've been to the **** mountain top
Heard **** talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo **** I'm gonna continue to rock

Getcha **** of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party, turn the music up
Let's get it started, go 'head shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up

Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the ****
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Come on girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Ohh girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Come on girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me

Obie Trice, one **** couldn't snuff young
Goodness gracious, haters stay on these ****
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious, full ****, ready to touch

Who's that in the cool blue back with a new rag
Givin' **** while he poppin' the clutch
True I had a few Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots it's on manual

The way I knock 'em outta they shoes
Talk a little **** then they **** ooze
Talk a little spit on my ****
Who, it's Shady

You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to **** you in the mansion
With a Magnum with a night pass to the matin√©e
[Incomprehensible] Obie came to party, you better ask somebody

Shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Come on girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Ohh girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
Come on girl, shake that **** for me, shake that **** for me
