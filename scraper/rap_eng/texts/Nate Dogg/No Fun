If Problem gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
And I'm married to the money, I'll admit we eloped
I got throat in hoopties, had more love than Lucy
Plus I'm with TGT, come be a groupie
I'm just kidding, just come check out the proposition
The mission we hitting is written, peep up the competition
We fixing the fly high, the try thing
You sexy and I heard that pussy tasty as Thai waves
Think about dining, I put that on the squidi'
Put my love in it then work it like a Jedi
Yeah it's all love girl, pop it like a pilli'
Compton California, this the diamond like a middi'
