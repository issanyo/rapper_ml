[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
Hey little mama with that tight dress on
I got a small proposition for you (ah, ah, ah, ah)
You look kinda sexy got it going on
Here's what I want you to do
(Here's what I want you to do)
Come a little closer, let me see that thong
Let me slide this number to you (Ah, ah, ah)
You can catch me in them streets with my blue khakis on
In my Chuck Taylors smoking blunts with my crew
(Gangsta walk)
