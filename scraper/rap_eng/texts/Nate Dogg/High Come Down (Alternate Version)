Chorus: Nate Dogg
Oooh, you make my
High, come down
Oooh, you make my
High
Come down
You make my high
Come
All the way, down
Oooh, you make my
High
Come down

Hook: Nate Dogg
Just hit the eastside
Of the fuckin' L.B.C
I don't associate with haters
Motherfuckin' gangstas we...
Just hit the dope
Spot
Just picked up some bomb ass weed
Man, I'll holla at you later
I'm about to hit these streets
As sure as my game is tight
Just spotted a real dime piece
I thought my day could not be greater
That's about the time I peeped (peaked?)
There go Mr. John N. Law
All in my rear view
The next thing I heard was sirens
Tell me, what am I to do?

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 1)
[Coolwadda]
Ay
Can I get a pass for that?
Tryin' to be in the back, where the stars is at
Seems like everybody got they shovels
Diggin' C&C
But you messin' with my high levels
Felt by devils
And blue dresses
To big booty ghetto ones
Heavy Metal ones
One
Actin' like that we don't pass it around
Hope you got a sack, girl, cause you bringin' me down

[Chico]
Slow motion on the blue court
Like I'm on a tight rope
Kid
Can't I spark it?
Flash, flash
The whole world's a ash tray, flick it on the dash
Then I parallel every car that pass
Ugh
Whoodie got that hash
Nate got more than an eight
That Dogg got Pounds in his safe
Don't it feel safe?
Between heaven and space?
Git these fucking weirdos out my face...

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Chico]
My Bible wouldn't been preached
Been the beast, I been the prey
Parallel park in here
And get towed away
Stowed away
In the back of the trunk where the tool be
Fools be actin' like I won't bust this uzi
Cool, he proves me
Over yonder
In that little white
Honda, Civic, they talk that street shit
Well then, I can get to livin'
Let me out here
Pivot post
I'm chippin' these niggas up close

[Coolwadda]
I bust the uzi so you can bust one
Must've brought your high
Down, to get you on one, Chico
So you know I'm on one
And when they scatter and run
Hop out the cut with the pump shotgun
Just in case
I got to come on y'all like eight minutes
Ride for the chips, parallel
Til we finish
Rearrange rap with the rare raw flow
Not feelin' y'all, bringin' down my hydro

Repeat Chorus
