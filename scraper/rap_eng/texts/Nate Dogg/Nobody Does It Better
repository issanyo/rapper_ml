[Intro: Nate Dogg]
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I'm sittin' here trippin', my mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's “Time To Concoct"
No one can do it better like this two man crew
Hey say we one-hitter quitters, now what cha'll gonna do?

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Always into somethin, that's my name
Only out for money, hey cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who had the most is he who won the match

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Strike one, me and Nate Dogg is a match
Stike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
My exhibition started back in '93
When wasn’t nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see
Nobody does it better than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Verse 5: Warren G]
They call me ‘Geezy the Spark Plug," keepin' it licked
There is no accident for these platinum hits
So when we make it to show love, bangin' in your club
Hangin' with your thugs, givin' up G love

[Verse 6: Nate Dogg]
Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you really think you wanna step to me
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Verse 7: Warren G]
Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby, so I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now

[Verse 8: Nate Dogg]
All you pimp playin' hustlers, now ya know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
