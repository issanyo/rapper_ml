Verse 1:
Its Friday Night
And I Was Faded & Buzzed
And uh I Hit The Spot
Rolling Deep With My Thugs
So Uh, I Came In & What Did I See?
A Gang Of Ladies In The House
All Dancing On Their Feet
DJ Dominator Straight
Scartching Up Them Beats
Mr. Criminal In The Background
Rolling Up The Trees
So I Creep
To The Front Just To Blaze Up
Puffing On The Cali Kush
Henny In My Cup
I See Some Honeys In A Ride
Straight Rollin' Up
Looking Like Some Hynas That I Knew
From Growing Up
She Said "That's Criminal
Tell Em Come & Roll With Us"
Homies In The Bushes
So Faded That They're Throwing Up
Mami Mira
I'm A Grab This Tequila
Tell The Homie Dominator
Lets Bounce
And I'm A See You At The After Spot
Lets Chill & Make It Pop
I See You At The Pad
2 A.M. Up On The Dot

Nate Dogg (Chorus):
Mami Mira
You're Such A Fine
And Such A Sexy Mamicita
Been On My Mind Girl
Since The First Time That I Seen Ya
If You Were My Girl
I Would Never Ever Leave Ya
Senorita
Mami Mira

Dominator (Verse 2):
Now When I Step In The spot
Right Away They Be Jockin Me
Like Nonstop
But Really It Doesn't Faze Me
Cause I See A Lady
Looking My Way
This Mamacita Is Amazing
(Oh Yeah)
And I Wanna Get To Know You
Just A Little More
Hoping For An Invitation
To An Open Door
Mami Mira If You Feeling Me
I'm Feeling You
Think Of All The Things That We Can Do

You Got That Thang Lil Mami
Got That Nice Little Body
We Can Do It
Take Your Time
Do It Right
How We Party
Intoxicated
We Faded
Its Going Down Tonight
Dominator, Nate Dogg, Mr. Criminal
When We Come To The Party
This Is How We Roll

Nate Dogg (Chorus):
Mami Mira
You're Such A Fine
And Such A Sexy Mamicita
Been On My Mind Girl
Since The First Time That I Seen Ya
If You Were My Girl
I Would Never Ever Leave Ya
Senorita
Mami Mira

Verse 3:
So What's It Gonna Be?
You Say You Never Had A Thug Like Me
So Come Roll With A G
We Can Get Away
Baby So Lets Ride
She Says She Loves My Song
Side 2 Side
And I Can Be Your Homie Girl
If You Let A Criminal In
Bragging Runnin' Round
Telling All Your Girfriends
Mami Mira
Baby Lets Ride Till The End
Mami Mira
Baby Lets Ride Once Again

Dominator:
Do You Wanna Ride With Me?
I'll Take You On A Trip
Where This Ride Don't Stop
Better Put Your Seatbelt On
Girl You Never Gonna Wanna Get Off
Do You Wanna Ride With Me?
You Been On My Mind Baby Girl
All Day
Oooh & I Just Gotta Say

Nate Dogg (Chorus):
Mami Mira
You're Such A Fine
And Such A Sexy Mamicita
Been On My Mind Girl
Since The First Time That I Seen Ya
If You Were My Girl
I Would Never Ever Leave Ya
Senorita
