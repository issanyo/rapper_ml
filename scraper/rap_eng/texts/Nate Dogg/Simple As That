[Hook: Six2]
Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

[Verse 1: Six2]
Hey boo, sorry if I talked to you late
I'm tryna let you know what's on my mind, okay?
You got a nigga wonderin' where you at sometime
Won't you let your boy put you on your back one time?
It's that cat that you make me chase
Is that nigga over there? Is he up in your face?
Handle your business baby girl, you straight
Just hit me when he leaves, straight lace no chase
It's a trip I kinda cut with her bra
Fuck her the next day, ass sweet, male dog
Sprung is what I figure she'd be
She did have a nigga now she fuckin' with me
You ain't know, true playas are picky
I fleed from the scene in corduroy Dickies
Got gang and I know how to act
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

[Verse 2: Six2]
I'm only out for breakin' you hoes for a phizze
Sevens up 30 Joes on your bizzay
Don't hide, divide your little Kit-Kat
Bitch, you know you wanna let a nigga hit that
I'm known to run game on most hoes
Don't hate me, I'm tryna get the pesos
Lay back, see Max never chase hoes
And as far as the bitches, see I make those
Indeed, bitch here with the weed
Oh please, I'm just tryna nut in your pussy and leave
It feel good but it hurt though
I get ghost on bitch, where my motherfuckin' shirt go?
Beat that coochie hole up in her moch
Lettin' you hoes know when I get you, I got you
Y'all remember me bein' true to the game
I gotta get it though, all coochie ain't the same

[Verse 3: Six2]
Do we know that it's me that call late at night?
Do we know that you a freak and ain't hittin' it right?
I ain't tryna come between y'all at all
What I feel is just lust so don't tell him 'bout us
Cause his brain is small and mine's is not
I'm still trippin' on that fine you got
If you don't look good, I don't
That nigga gon' get you stuck in the hood, I won't
I bet you think he love you to death but he don't
He ain't givin' you what you need and won't
You probably already think I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

[Bridge]
Just call me on the phone
When your man ain't home, I'll be there
Let's break you off, shake him off
Take it off bae, right there
Keep it on the low, low (low, low, low, low)
Ain't nobody gotta know that I be the [?] of slow
Keep it on the low low
Oooh! Ain't nobody gotta know, be that kind of slow
