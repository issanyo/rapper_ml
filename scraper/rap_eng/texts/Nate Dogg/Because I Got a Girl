[Verse 1]
When the cats, away
The mice will play
That's what the people say
All I know is dogs play anyways
'Cause I play every day
You do it too don't lie
Soon as you're out my site
I seen you creepin' by
While I was creepin' mine
While I was checkin' out
I saw you checkin' in
I shoulda knocked you out
But I was with your friend

[Chorus]
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off
(Come on) Come on girl let me hit it
(Come on) Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
(Come on) Come on girl let me hit it
(Come on) Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
(Come on) Come on girl let me hit it
(Come on) Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
(Come on) Come on girl let me hit it
(Come on) Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it

[Verse 2]
Back in the days I used to like bitches
But I tell you nowadays bitches ain't shit
And if you wonder why I say this
I've had a few bitches and bitches think they slick
Runnin around, playin' all my niggas
Trying to split a brother from his grip
Got all these busters watchin' me
But I tell you right now ho, I don't slip
I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite girl
But I won't you know why, because she's a trick
And if I give a shout out to a sneaky bitch
I got to give a shout to the nigga she's sneakin' with (and all my homeys say)

[Chorus]
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk (come on girl let me hit it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off (meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk (come on girl let me hit it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off (meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk (come on girl let me hit it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off (meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean we can't talk (come on girl let me hit it)
Because I got a girl, don't mean I won't break you off (meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it)
Come on girl let me hit it
Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
Come on girl let me hit it
Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
Come on girl let me hit it
Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it
Come on girl let me hit it
Meet me at the Telly that's if you’re with it

[Outro]
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
