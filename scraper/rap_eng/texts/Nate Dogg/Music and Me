[Verse 1]
Hey OG
Could you tell how to find some good weed
I need it homie oh so fast
That last bag was the best weed I've ever had
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet
Girls so fine, I can't help it got to make this one mine
I hit em with my, gangsta leans
They can't seperate my music from me

[Hook]
Music and me
Music, my music and me
Music and me
Music, my music and me
Music and me
Music, my music and me

[Verse 2]
Time does change, but the music it remains the same
I hit em with the music from the slaves
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave
I don't want you to think I don't know
They taught me how to reach deep down and touch the soul
Without my music, where would I be
You thought me how to cry and still remain a G
You keep alot of soldiers at ease
And together the next level proceed

[Hook]
Music and me
Music, my music and me
Music and me
Music, my music and me
Music and me
Music, my music and me

[Verse 3]
Music and me
Go together, perfect harmony
Soft and mellow
Oh so hard it'll make your speakers explode
Stay with me
And together we will live out this dream
My music and me

[Hook]
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
My music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
My music and me
