[Kurupt]
Kurupt and Daz, grips on the handle
Two to the mandible, bows indeed
Bustas and g's, pound to Shyne
Hammer click, that's clickin' for me one more time
Up and down, in and out, spendin' outs, spendin' in and out
I seen niggas like you, they usually get blasted
Cameras to memorial lies, open caskets
Open season, rhyme or reason
Crime time, prime time, V.I.C. this
Young Got'stra, step in and dump on the hostages
Smoke like sausages, niggas coverin' they hair like ostriches
Ostrisize, swallow like lasengers
C.O.'s so crooked, come equipped with shank sticks

[Hook: Kurupt]
Yeah, that's my dogg
Life, Behind the Walls
Life, Behind the Walls
Suckers, welcome to Oz niggas, surprise niggas

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
West coast representin for all my doggs
One love to my doggs behind the walls
Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all
Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall
West coast representin for all my doggs
One love to my doggs behind the walls
Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all
Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall

[Shyne]
Rhyme through the city on dubs and vodes
Trunk full of cash, gangsta roll
Kurupt and Nate, from the empire state
It's the nigga Shyne Po, hold up, wait
It ain't where you from, it's where your gat at
I keep mine on my lap, windows black
Top is hard, white as soft
And that mullen and shit, like I'm lovin' the shit
Gorilla nigga, in the flesh
And I'll kill you nigga, in your vest
I had bullets goin' in and out ya'll
Slout ya'll, make ya mouth pour
Blood is a blood sport, in that Porshe
At that port, waitin' on that horse
It's the O.G., niggas know me, but the boat leak, ain't no peace
Revenge is a bitch, and I can't wait to fuck her
(Kurupt: murderous, Mr. Deadly Zone), I'm deady as can get it

[Hook]

[Nate Dogg]
Well I've arrived at my new home, cell three
I looked around and what did I see
One of them clowns one of my enemies
Gotta stay down so I make me some weed
It's goin' down in the morning, on me
Soon as they say hey line up, let's leave
Right now the nigga just as safe as can be
But when we hit the kitchen man, sleep
Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all
When you wanna make a hit, give me a call
West coast represent for all my doggs
One love to my dogs behind the walls
Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all
Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall
West coast represent for all my doggs
One love to my dogs behind the walls

[Kurupt]
I'm like, you wanna bang nigga? Well yo, bag in here
You wanna hang like a g, fool, hang in here
Where all the gangstas at, rollin' through, homey
Fleetwoods, cadillacs, straight gangsta mack mat
Before I got stuck, I was cool as fuck
On the streets like nigga, I ain't give a fuck
I had Daz by my side, my little brother, huh
And this is how we do it, nigga, all ready to dump
I got a bitch, she's known, for eatin' the dick
I never gave a fuck, nigga, never gave a shit
It's me and Mike Dean, doin' what the fuck we wanna do
And M-16, nigga, clearin' the scene, this is the gangsta lean
And the gangsta vibe, keep it gangstafied, nigga, do or die
Yeah I roll with them niggas, cuz it's ride or die
And I always get high, nigga, livin' my life
Inmates are so crooked, come equipped with the shank sticks

[Hook]

[Chorus]
