[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When your days get lonely (days get lonely)
When your nights get cold (nights get cold)
When the rain starts pouring (rains starts pouring)
When your man ain't home (man ain't home)
You can call me baby (call me baby)
You can let me know (let me know)
You ain't had none lately (had none lately)
Lemme in your backdoor (let me in your backdoor)

[Verse 1]
Meanie walks out the door
Meanie act like he dont want you no more
You can do the same thang
Two can play at this game
With his love and you bored
He got you doing his chores
Minus will be with me
You ain't nobody's slave
When your days get lonely

[Hook]
When your days get lonely (days get lonely)
When your nights get cold (nights get cold)
When the rain starts pouring (rains starts pouring)
When your man ain't home (man ain't home)
You can call me baby (call me baby)
You can let me know (let me know)
You ain't had none lately (had none lately)
Lemme in your backdoor (let me in your backdoor)

[Verse 2]
He ain't never gone change (change)
He still be playing them games
You can do the same thang
Girl I won't say a thang
If you dont tell, I won't tell (won't tell)
We gave in life, what the hell
We both want the same thang (same thang)
Ain't no need to complain
When your days get lonely
