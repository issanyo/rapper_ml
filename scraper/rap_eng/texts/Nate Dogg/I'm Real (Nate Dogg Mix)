[J. Lo (Nate)]
Now only God can hold me
(You make me go "baby")

[Jennifer]
I've seen so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hungers pain
And when I'm feeling sexy who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is their insecurities

[Nate Dogg]
Tell me who is that girl, standing cross the way
She like what I got, got, got, watch her become my slave
Baby girl it's me, yeah that crazy nigga Nate
I won't 'lax so don't talk back let's be on our way

(Chorus)
[Nate Dogg]
You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me...

[Jennifer]
Now people loving me, and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live is to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

(Chorus) x2

(Bridge - till fade)
[Nate Dogg]
You make me, eww
You make me go

[Nate Dogg]
Watch out 'fore I ball
I'm looking for a girl who's got it all
Ain't flashing no bills
Just testing my skills
I'm looking for a sexy girl to take and peel

(Chorus- till fade)
