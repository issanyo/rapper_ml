Nate Dogg, where we at?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
In the middle of the jungle
In the middle of the concrete jungle where my real dogs
Kick it with me, oh woah!
Here we come, here we keep it come come
Smoke some bomb ass sticky with me, hell yeah!
I just bought me a blue navigator it's a long ass stretchin' 'mosine
I really got no patience for you haters and I'm runnin' over niggas with beef, woah lord!
Good Goddy, let's party here come the niggas from T3
Oh they naughty, not hardly they only hang with DPG
Woah lord

[Verse 1: Six2]
See me movin' in slow mo' 'cause I don't dance
I ain't tellin' you hoes no more let go my pants
I'm just tryna let you know the reason I came
I'm just really tryna lace you up on game
We party 'til we can't no more in this domain
It's your world playgirl so just do yo' thang
Can't nobody tell you who to sock it to
Shit I don't see nobody in here stoppin' you
They like it when I do that; tell 'em to strip
I won't even speak on what they do with they lips
Damn you look good the way you movin' your hips
Let yo' backbone slip, girl don't even trip
Look at this nigga showboats what haters be sayin'
I'm a macadamian nut they think I be playin'
I see me and you ain't on the same page
Hey little mama later meet me backstage
See 'cause parties ain't parties 'til we crankin' it up
We ain't leavin' this motherfucker 'til the sun come up
7-Up and Henny is what I got in my cup
We balla 'holics steady fuckin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
In the middle of the jungle
In the middle of the concrete jungle where my real dogs
Kick it with me, oh woah!
Here we come, here we keep it come come
Smoke some bomb ass sticky with me, hell yeah!
I just bought me a blue navigator it's a long ass stretchin' 'mosine
I really got no patience for you haters and I'm runnin' over niggas with beef, woah lord!
Good Goddy, let's party here come the niggas from T3
Oh they naughty, not hardly they only hang with DPG
Woah lord

[Verse 2: U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.]
I like women of all sizes, bow legged wearin' disguises
G string located where her thigh's at
I provide the thing, know the black man dingo
Heavy structure so I swing low, and 'cause havoc
Me in the club gettin' sweated by broads automatic
Two one though all the way down your throat
Kissin' and pass it, dockin' up tight, watchin' via satellite
I'm hangover from last night hand out the kryptonite
Rewind my pimpin' money six foes and woman
I've been raw since the beginnin', 22 inches I'm spinnin' 'em (What y'all wanna do?)
Bang The Diggy Diggy Doc album and watch ya get remixed by Clue
Rollin' through residential neighborhoods, shatterin' windows
Movin' like smooth criminal, smokin' and passin' indo (What y'all wanna do?)
Put Dallas on the map before your U.P.-T.I.G.H.T. is critical

[D.O.C.]
(You little prizzle is off the hizzle my nizzle oh fo' shizzle)
(And I'm about toss it DOcizzle, like candy)
I like the way you lick it baby
You got ya foot in this stock stick it baby (Oh really?)
Like mr. infinity, I could you fuck with my brand [?]
(Is that Jazze phizzy?, oh he must be crazy)
(He's got a 100 breezy, is that yo' lady?)
(It's the party of the heezy)

[Jazze Pha]
I'm start to finish
Don't even try if your heart ain't it
I'm from the dirty south, best believe we keep it crunk
I refuse to talk loud, and say nothin'

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
In the middle of the jungle
In the middle of the concrete jungle where my real dogs
Kick it with me, oh woah!
Here we come, here we keep it come come
Smoke some bomb ass sticky with me, hell yeah!
I just bought me a blue navigator it's a long ass stretchin' 'mosine
I really got no patience for you haters and I'm runnin' over niggas with beef, woah lord!
Good Goddy, let's party here come the niggas from T3
Oh they naughty, not hardly they only hang with DPG
Woah lord
