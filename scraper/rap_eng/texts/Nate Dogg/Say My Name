[Eminem]
This ain't beef man, I don't know what the fuck to call it

[Verse 1: KAOS]
I loven when people be talkin' like they won't get smacked up
You won't fight, cause when I stepped to ya, ya backed
I ain'y all hood, cause if I was you'd get clapped up or ya brain stompped, catch me on bathsalts
Lil homie getcha face chompped, and just don't talk about me behind my back
Dont tell me what you meant, all you speak is lies bro
The truth has been bent more than Fujimi Kaido, you get cut off like circulation to ya brain when being hanged
Aw man you gon get kicked in ya stomach, keep my name outcha mouth if you don't then get to runnin'
Don't talk that thug ish to me, lil homie you ain't stunttin'
Don't claim the gang if you don't know the slang, this ain't a game cause one day you'll be lampin' i'll catch you and i'll let the nine bang
Leave you leakin'
"OH MY GOD KAOS IS COMIN"
Hell yeah im glad you ain't speakin'

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talkin'sayin' my name
Seems like ya mouth is not connected to ya brain
2-0-0-3, that shit it ain't the same
Betta heave a strap my nigga simple and plain
Put ya nuts on the table my nigga lets play the game
Hurt you so long you be a-diccted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you or do not explain
Right before you lay in yo coffin ho say my name

[Verse 2]
"Damn what he say before?"
Y'all heard me and I ain't trynna act hardcore
If you don't like it jus say it to my face if you dont then you'll be punched in yours, slammed on the floor, the thrown threw the door
And all of this could've been avoid
"But bro I didn't say it!"
Shut up I know it was you
You ain't gotta twin or a stunt double dude
These stroies go from one person to the next and they're never the same between people
They get reworded like sentences during telefono
I'm always pissed off I tend not to let my anger go
Bluma put this bomb inside of me so someone please help me self-destruct
"I'M SORRY KAOS I DIDN'T-!"
Too late, close ya eyes and tell ya life good riddens
If you got wrist imma slit 'em
Thats KAOS, thats KAOS
Aye yo Nate Dogg, go on and hit 'em with the hook

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't spit bars I throw up prisons and that's exactly where i'll end up if I catch fellings
What you ain't fellin' me?
Well then you must have C.I.P.A
How you gon talk bout someone who was never fake?
Then you get mad when they turn around and retaliate, in anywhere, on anyday
And this is hip hop, so piss of the cat and they'll let the semi spray
Say whatchu wanna say
Cause I know im ill without the matic, you can just be passin' and i'll spark without the static
How do I think this way when there's nothin' in my attic?
So that helps me stand out like one bold word in a italicized paragraph
I'm the highest bar on the graph
To be honest, the main reasons why I rap is because of my mother and best of all my biological dad

[Hook]
