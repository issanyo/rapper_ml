C'mon
Dance with me, baby girl
Dance with me, baby girl
C'mon
Dance with me, baby girl
Dance with me, baby girl
Man I was dancing
Prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging
Moving, grooving 'cause the music's booming
Macking, tryna get some action, packing
Acting, manish, drinking
Tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening
Really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token
Choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open
Knowing that my girl's at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring
Warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interruption
Busted my girl's in the club
Ring the alarm
Your woman has just been sighted
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited?
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lightning
Ring the alarm
I'm not tryna be ducking and diving
Ring the alarm
Headed, top speed for the exit
Damnit don piece can't grab it
Habit like chasing my cabbage
Magic, time to disappear fast with
This chick, who I slept last week with
Real trick, I like her 'cause she real slick
Let's dip, I don't care who you came with
No lip, got no time for some bullshit
She went, that she all in the backpen
Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement
Two sense, got no time for your comments
Don't trip, do you know where my girl went?
Ring the alarm
Your woman has just been sighted
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited?
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lighting
Ring the alarm
I'm not tryna be ducking and diving
Ring the alarm
Listen, I'm in the club
No where I ain't even suppose to be
Drinking with a girl all close to me
I'm all up in the air
Telling her some superfly shit she need to hear
Thinking can't nobody see us, 'cause we in the rear
All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here
'Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
Ita be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in
You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio
I take one step, what do I see my girl
Coming threw the door but she don't see me
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodgeing
Hiding, praying to God that she don't come find me
What was I thinking of, I should of never
Parked my car in front of the club damn
Ring the alarm
Your woman has just been sighted
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited?
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lighting
Ring the alarm
I'm not tryna be ducking and diving
