[Verse 1]
I can't hold back I feel like something's going on
It's been a week and we keep walkin' round like nothing's wrong
Maybe I should just pack my shit and just move along

[Chorus: Unknown Female Singer]
(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)

[Verse 2]
And I swear that I can't understand why
Sometimes you like leaving
And sometimes for no reason
One day you just stop believing
But this time you're gon' see, when I'm gone

[Chorus: Unknown Female Singer]
(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Female Singer]
Love don't love nobody
Love don't come for free
And if you love somebody
(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)

[Verse 3]
Remember the time, when we was in Mamma's bed with no clothes on?
We was O so wrong!
And nobody could tell us shit because â€” back then we thought that we were inseparable
And now it's just so easy, to watch you go
No more confrontations
No more constant pages
I'm sick and tired of always changing faces
Oooh! And it seemed like a life-time
But I think it's the right time for me and you to leave it alone

[Chorus: Unknown Female Singer]
(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Female Singer]
Love don't love nobody
Love don't come for free
And if you love somebody
(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)
