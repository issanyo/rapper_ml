[Hook: Sly]

At first they groove for the underdog
Till, you win the brawl
Now, it's you they call
PROOF! They gots to be the proof for the underdog
Till, you prove them wrong
Now, you gots to fall
They gots to be the proof [go down x8]
You gots to be the proof [go down x8]
They gots to be the proof

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]

Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em'
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cuz them niggas just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]

They say why don't we increase the peace
The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cuz iggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've readched the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm try to be bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga trying to throw me an obstacle
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen
