[Verse: Eve]
Could neva' claim to be a gangsta nigga, just gangsta
Now take a sip 'a something, let me entertain ya
This funk is for them rowdy niggas liable to shank ya
A cock back blast, wit no questions asked
So just, hold tight, don't let the liquor run your whole night
Don't let a sucka into courage fuck up your whole life
I play the cut and analyze the view
Push up my glass just to acknowledge the chosen few
Cause I don't fuck wit many
Especially the tough ones off a glass of Henny
Especially the ones always frontin' that don't have a penny
I run wit niggas that demand respect
And I'm a boss bitch, most y'all can't handle that
All you can do is watch your glide
It take a special type 'a nigga
'Bout something that can stop a stride
Cause I can't respect a nigga that's soft
And I bet ya'll neva' seen it comin'
Me and my nigga Nate Dogg, uh

[Hook - 1]
All the girls get up (get up, get up)
Take it to the floor (take it to the floor)
Speakers 'bout to blow (c'mon, c'mon)
Turn it up some more (turn it up some more)
All my dogs get down (get up, get up)
Let me see you boogie (let me see ya dance)
All the girls get up (get up, get up)
Let me see you move it (get up and get down)

[Verse: Nate Dogg]
I'm on my way to the liquor store
With E-V-E and my nigga Roast
Got too much game to be slippin' on
I let you know if you didn't know
Never will you be able to fuck wit me
Never will I ever stop bustin' I'm making E
Whenever I retire I'm a still be making beats
Shit that keep yo head bobbing, keep moving your feet
Shake that baby, drivin' me crazy
I want that thang no if, and's, or maybe's
I just might keep it if you could keep a secret
Best believe I know how to please it
Twist and turnin' got my body burnin'
She ain't a pro yet but homie she learnin'

[Hook - 1]

[Verse: Nate Dogg]
It's 4:00, club is lettin' out
Met in the club now we playin' house
I'm drunk as hell so I'm showing out
Put on my glove then I knocked it out
I'm so cold, way too smooth
Girls they know, what to do
Shake that baby, drivin' me crazy
I want that thang no if, and's, or maybe's
I just might keep it if you could keep a secret
Best believe I know how to please it
Twist and turnin' got my body burnin'
She ain't a pro yet but homie she learnin'

[Hook - 2]
All the girls get up (get up, get up)
Take it to the floor (take it to the floor)
Speakers 'bout to blow (c'mon, c'mon)
Turn it up some more (turn it up some more)
All my dogs get down (get up, get up)
Let me see you boogie (let me see ya dance)
All the girls get up (get up, get up)
Let me see you move it

[Bridge]
I know, you came to have a fuckin' party
I know it's about time to get shit started
You know, that I'm a bad man
Nobody can do this like I can
Nate gon' make ya get up

[Hook - 3]
All the girls get up
Take it to the floor
Speakers 'bout to blow
Turn it up some more
All my dogs get down
Let me see you boogie
All the girls get up
Let me see you move it
