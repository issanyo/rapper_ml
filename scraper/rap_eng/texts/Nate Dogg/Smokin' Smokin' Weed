[Hook]
Smoking smoking weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Smoking smoking weed

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
Rinse my mouth out, now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg so go and puff puff
Real talk, can you still walk?
Have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
See that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
Smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat before you fall out
I'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J, he knows what time it was
(Smoking, smoking weed)

[Hook]
In the Cadillac, with my head back
Feeling real good cause it's like that
Another 20' sack we've got plenty' that
We keep doing that

[Hook 2]
Smoking smoking weed
Smokin on these trees, keeps me at ease With these
Crazy things I see
Smokin on these trees, keeps me it seems
And I don't just where I'd be - smoking smoking weed

[Hook]
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

[Verse 2: Shortymack]
So what you got nigga? (knockout)
I got the cush and the yerp
Packaged in P's to keep the feds of my chirp
Uhh cause my nerves' on alert
Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work
Look pimpin I ain't touching that dirt
I ain't smokin that shit
It'll make your whole head hurt
I got the card for the cataract
Doctor say it's legal
To twist up green
Call it Philadel eagle (shortymack)
Knockout pays me my check
Silver haze blowin out the Lamborghini air vents
I got the blunts and a pound of leaves
I been the purp man plus I got that OG

[Verse 3: Ray J]
(I wanna) roll it, roll it, twist that, twist that
(I wanna) fire it up, then get that, get that
(I wanna) pass it around, get bent back bent back
Give it back to me! (Smoking smoking weed)

[Hook]
Havin a party (Bring the weed)

I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her

Where did my pipe go?

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
(Slim Thugga Muh Fugga)
Blaze in the bush of that cush
You gotta pull hard then push
I blow dro but to each his own
And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong
We can be outta town
We can be at home
I keep a good connect for that Cali grown
Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac
It's in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac
It's a buck that's a fact
Won't accept nothin less
So you can smoke alone
On your sack of stress (yes)
Pass the cush, let me hit that next
Slim thugga muh fugga
I smoke the best

[Hook]
Havin a party (Bring the weed)

Where did my pipe go?

[Outro]
Ha ha it's your boy Ray J
You know what? I'm a roll up one right now
And celebrate a lil bit
You know Raydiation in stores right now
Ya'll go get it
Shortymack comin real soon
It's about to get ugly

[Fade out]
