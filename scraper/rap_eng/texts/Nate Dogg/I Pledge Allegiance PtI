I, pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I, give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
May the funk, never end
I pledge allegiance, to paper chasers
To hustlers who be steady pullin' capers
Peace and blessing
May the sun always shine on you
I'm servin' paper, see you later
I guess that's one mo' thing, I can't be faited
You can test me, get discombobulated
Ain't no question I'm gonna fuck with this
I do it for the funk of it
I, pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I, give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
May the funk, never end
I pledge allegiance to my homies who keep it gangsta
Fuck all the haters they can't stop this groove
I pledge allegiance to the game 'cause it got me ballin'
Game don't wait so I'm not stallin'
I'm still dissin', she's still callin'
See this is front line, no turnin' back now
I'm about to score, this is war on the track now
Give me my vest and my ammo and my mac now
I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord
I'm a get it in the worst way
Slay, competition move the opposition
Back wake the fuck up 'cause when I get beyond enemy lines
I might snipe that ass like john Kennedy's mind
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessey
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty
Ride for the funk, cry for the funk
In the heat of night, I die for the funk
Pharaoh, when I'm six feet deep there's no greivin'
Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance 'cause
I, pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I give my body
(I pledge allegiance to my homies who keep it gangsta)
And I give my soul to the funk
(Fuck all the haters they can't stop this groove)
May the funk, never end
(I pledge allegiance to the game 'cause it got me ballin')
(Game don't wait so I'm not stallin', I'm still dissin', she's still callin')
I, pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I, give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
May the funk
