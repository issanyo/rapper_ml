[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Wooooh!
Yeah!
"Welcome to tha Church: Volume II"
Exclusive 213
(uh hah hah, uh hah hah)
Got my nephew Nate Dogg in them house
Nate Dogg holla at 'em
Where you at?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Ridin' in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
She was reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for
(Why?)
Cause I'm fly

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super fly
NATE DOGG!

[Nate Dogg]
Woah ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know he super fly
But me I'm Snooper Dooper and I'm super duper fly
I'd be the greatest-est I know you waited this
And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age
Is that the way you gonna be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a player
Let me help out your pride?
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a psychologist
A shrink or a freak
Peep (my) my technique
I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the the one that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC
And I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too
I'm a real pimp player from the 213 crew
Now look here boo
If you gonna bang or hang with the Dogg
You best to get in
Holla at her Nate Dogg
(Holla, holla)

[Hook:Nate Dogg]
Riding in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
She was reaching for stars
I just want me something natural (Is that right Nate Dogg?)
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home (Damn nigga)
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for
(Why?)
"Cause I'm fly

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super fly
NATE DOGG!

[Nate Dogg]
Woah ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Warren G...
3 piece with a mink
Gotta think my shit stinks
Stacy Adams with a drink
Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks
So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin', watching "The Lion King"
Crying and thangs
Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate - singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late cause I'm grinding for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Hop back and I'm trying to aim
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulating, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for the riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go
You know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagn, caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you...
And I laugh

[Hook:Nate Dogg]
Riding in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
She reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super fly
NATE DOGG!

Woah ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah
