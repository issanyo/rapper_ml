[Verse 1: Nate Dogg & Barbara Wilson]
I've been lookin' for a girl
Someone to share my world
For maybe just a day or two
You've been actin' so stingy
I know you wanna' see
If I can do the things you heard
Actually I'd rather be out with my girls and weed
I guess that goes go to show you don't know me boy
If you really want to creep
Then talk to me with cheese
Or just don't even talk at all

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
She's strange and I like it
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me
I got game
So don't fight it
All around the world she's just a sexy girl
Strange

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg & Barbara Wilson]
You be actin' like you cool
Like you don't want to do
The things I know you want to do
Are you tryin' to come up
Or maybe just get fucked
Whatever girl I'm down like you
If you wasn't so damn cute
I wouldn't even shoot
But yet you choose to shoot me down
Actually it's time I leave
Your girl is jockin' me
I hope she's not another tease
Listen here I'd like to know
Why you keep actin' strange
I got no time to chase a hoe
But I'd like to know your name
All I got is game to give
And it's gonna' be cryin' shame
If you choose to disregard
And pass up on this game

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
She's strange and I like it
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me
I got game
So don't fight it
All around the world she's just a sexy girl
Strange
