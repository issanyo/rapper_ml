(Chorus)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man scared of love

When they asked me
Why I dont like love
Or why I dont have a lady
Maybe its because I know
As soon as I tell her
How I feel about her
As soon as I act like
I love her she's gone

(Chorus)
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I dont have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

(Butch Cassidy)
I really was so into you
But you dont know what I'm going through
You say you really care for me
But in love there's no guarantee
So, I think I outta take my time
Cuz love ain't no friend of mine you see

Dont let me get you too confused
You're the friend I dont want to lose
If I made a choice its you I choose
But my heart's a tad bit through
So, I try to get you off my mind
But a remedy I cannot find for you

(Chorus)
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I dont have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

(Butch Cassidy)
I'm never gonna try to find
Another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
But traces they'll never find
No, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)
Won't be nothing gettin back to you

(Nate Dogg)
Now dont think that I'm being rude
Because I won't commit to you
And other women want to screw
Whats a player supposed to do
So, I'll be slippin on my hat
I won't be bringin nothing back to you

(Chorus) x2
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (thats why I dont have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
