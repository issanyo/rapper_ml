What's happenin' baby? (what's up Snoop?)
Over there lookin' all good (heh, yeah)
Oh, you don't like gangsta's? (I mean)
But you ain't even heard what I have to say
I, I just look like this (yeah right)
No, nah, hear me out (yeah)
On the real (oh)
Check this out (uh, do it, uh)

[Snoop]
Baby, you finer than a muth...
I don't play basketball or do the fashion mall
They call me Doggy Dogg, the realest of 'em all
You got problems? Then holla at the big Dogg
I come get ya bone, play dumb for you
I got a little somethin' to do
Then I got a little somethin' for you
Just don't play no games with me baby
Cuz I could get you what you need
If you just let a gangsta proceed
Spank you, drink you up under the table
And at the end of the night, I let you run my doghouse
Kink, erotic, exotic, whatever
You want it? I got it
You can get it forever
DPG, see, that's my set
If you get with me, I'll give you somethin' that you'll never forget

I can't go for that, no no, no can do
I can't go for that, no no, no can do
I can't go for that, no no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't go for that
Can't go for that

[Warren G]
You said it's on, babygirl, I could tell in your voice
I want it all, breasts and thighs, plus a short mini-skirt
Make it work, so I can see you jiggle
And play dot to dot, let me put it in the middle
Make you wiggle like a worm when this ball is dropped
No Viagra needed, cuz you know I stay weeded
Like a champion soldier, uh
And it ain't no fun if I can't hold ya
You can't go for that? You better go for this
Me and you on a ship sippin' Crys
Reminisce babygirl, it's a thug world
I'm a bad boy lookin' for a bad girl
Like you, let me beat it, you don't need it
2-1-3'd out, Warren G'd out
L-B-C'd out, what?
So I could meet wit you
Or you could meet at my house

Repeat 1

Nate Dogg

[Nate Dogg]
Girl, me, I got a bad attitude
Oh oh, tell me what am I supposed to do (tell me)
I only wanna get next to you, next to you
Not like them other fools, that used to ball wit you
I wanna groove wit you, like Ron Isley do (woo)
We need to find us a place to play (place to play)
Fix a time, and just get away
Let's just go with Tamia, yeah (oh yeah)
Ain't no runnin' errands today
Don't need no money, you're straight
Throw all your cares away
Sip with gangsta Nate
