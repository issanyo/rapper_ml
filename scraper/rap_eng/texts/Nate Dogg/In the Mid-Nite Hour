[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Make love to you, tonight
Touch you, feel you, tonight
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour

[Verse 1: Warren G]
Another late night, yeah, usual, locked in the studio
Thinking 'bout when I leave, what I'm gon' do to you
Talking dirty all night while I'm mixing records
It's 11:30, don't worry, I'll be there in seconds
Forget getting dirty, baby, just get naked
Put on some old school grooves, a Marvin Gaye record
Teddy P. , close the door; a love T.K.O
Play The Whispers and The O'Jays, it's on fo' sho'
I remember when I used to be a young'n
First time I heard Barry White it made me feel something
Tonight's the night, let's do what you like
Sip some Dom PÃ©rignon, a little candlelight
I got the whip cream and strawberries, take a bite
Gon' have to call in sick cause this gon' take all night
Then early in the morning I'mma tap it right
You make me wanna get married, I'm just playin', psych

[Hook]
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Grab your lover or your friend and just step together
It's just a moment in time, make it last forever
Barbeque's, house parties, skating breaks, whatever
With someone special in your life it don't get no better
So even when the rainfall changes the weather
We could do like Al Green baby, Stay Together
Girl I love it when we almost break up
Fight and fuss, kiss and hug, then we make up
Make love all night then we wake up
Early morning, sunshine through them bedroom blinds
Folks smile cause I'm yours and you still mine
Cause real talk everyday ain't valentine
Somehow some way we do just fine
So remember when I'm gone out there on the grind
And you at home all alone with me on your mind
I'm just a call away

[Hook]
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love to you, in the midnight hour
Touch you, hold you, feel you, make love to you
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
I wanna make love, in the midnight
