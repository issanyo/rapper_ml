[Nate Dogg]
I won't tell your boyfriend [7X]
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)

I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend that youse a hoe
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell yo' brand new man yo' ass is broke
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell how you licked me oh from head to toe
I ain't never gon' tell your brand new man how you swallow

[Chorus]
If he needs to know
I won't tell your boyfriend [2X]
If he has to know
I won't tell your boyfriend [2X]
If he wants to know
I won't tell your boyfriend [2X]
If he's gotta know
I won't tell your boyfriend
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)

[Nate Dogg]
I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend where I'd like to go
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell his ass not to mad dog me no mo'
(Never gon' tell)
When he look into my eyes he know I can show him better if he go
(Cause I ain't never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell his next of kin where his body's roped{?}
(If he needs to know)

[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
(I ain't never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell yo' man first date I took you home
I ain't never gon' tell him what you did in the back of my Rolls
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' say a word, you can show him when you all alone
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend the girl I met was a pro

[Chorus]
[Knoc-turn'al]
You can link up with me (and creep after midnight)
K-N-O-C (keepin my game tight)
I like the fact that you like girls and like guys
All at one time (I won't tell your boyfriend)
Lookin for something just to get into
And creeping low on a mission (smash it)
Down the avenue
Ain't got much time baby girl so hop in
And then, a quarter of two, sex rendition
Do ya thang but I (won't tell ya boyfriend)
Know that I don't sing a sad hymn
No mockingbird in I, that ain't him
So findin out about me is real slim
My name in your phone ain't Knoc, my name's Tim
I won't testify, I'm gon' ride my whole life
See me spin on chrome rims

[Nate Dogg]
(I ain't never gon' tell)
When we first met homegirl you was young, beautiful and bold
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell your man youse a freak like Anna Nicole
(Never gon' tell)
I ain't never gon' tell him about that time you came to my do'
(Never gon' tell)
Late night, Trump tight, midnight, just right, trenchcoat, no clothes

[Chorus]
[Outro: Nate Dogg]
I ain't never gon' tell
I won't tell your boyfriend [7X]
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)
I won't tell your boyfriend [7X]
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)
(I won't tell your girlfriend) [7X]
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)
