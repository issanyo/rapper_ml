[Intro]
You ready?
I don't have no words, I need to put some down
I need you to push your record button
I'm on it Nate

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna spend the day
Alone without nobody, nobody
Even lovers need a holiday
Sometimes you gotta get away, from everybody

[Verse 1]
See some people want you to do better
Just not better than them
It's the game I got from my godfather
The infamous [?]
A fake friend in the shadow only come around when the sun is shining
That's why I want you to stay on the grind
Mindin' yo' buisness and keep grindin'
From [?] to the [?] LA Pomona to the [?]
Even in Inglewood and Compton we listened to yo' daddy [?]
Ain't no way in the world I could put all this here in sixteen doors
And just doing this with Lil Nate Dogg is makin' this shit twice as hard
But I'ma [?] you expect me to be and take a toast
And thanks to Snoop Dogg a big person [?] my daughter, I'll sign em' both
It's been puff puff pass radio stations the news and all that
And I bet you and 2Pac got something to do with the west gettin' [?]
It's still [?] foundation on my Nate Dogg, I ain't forgot shit
[?] got a lil' brother called Salam, now he cuttin' all the hits
[?] locals and dirty OG but we still Pomona city ridin'
Now It's long beach Pomona city movement with Snoop Dogg beside us

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna spend the day
Alone without nobody, nobody
Even lovers need a holiday
Sometimes you gotta get away, from everybody

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just wanna chill with pops
Sit back, have a couple laughs
Take back a few Henny shots
Roll up , burn it down
Talk about sky boxin'
[?]
Lil' nigga eatin' on things we talk about
I just smile, look up [?] to the clouds
Now you lookin' down, we'll be alright
I could hear you sayin' now
Hell boys our last name comes with the crowd
This a legacy we all ways gon' hold down
I'm just livin' life, one day at a time
I'm in here with Pimpin laughin' bout' good times
It's so crazy he say I'm you in disguise
I reply I'm Lil Nate, now pass me that fire
I sit back and reminisce
So [?], boy those days was lit
I miss you pops, you know I'm gon' represent
And today I swear my mood like this

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna spend the day
Alone without nobody, nobody
Even lovers need a holiday
Sometimes you gotta get away, from everybody

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch you said you love me, but you could never show it
Bitch I gave you money and all you do is blow it
The truth is what I'm sayin' and bitch you really know it

Bitch you said you love me, but you could never show it
Bitch I gave you money and all you do is blow it
The truth is what I'm sayin' and bitch you really know it
Heyy..

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna spend the day
Alone without nobody, nobody
Even lovers need a holiday
Sometimes you gotta get away, from everybody
