He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes

Them boys in the club always looking for a blockhead
Y'all the same ones givin' up non-stop
So get it right before you step to me rugged
I like them brands, betta rip on them cookies
I gotta have that dough
I like the hit (???) cuz I'm a jazzy...(girl)
This fit that I'm fittin' cost more than them 24s
If you gotta ask, you can't afford what it's hittin' for
I change rides more than some of y'all change clothes
It's so hot, but yet the wrists is so cold
One to the head, two more to get me loose
Once I hit the floor you can blame it on the Grey Goose

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)

Antique jeans with the stones on the booty
Ghetto fabulous in the club, give it to me
I like to lean and pop, I like to jig and stop
It take a lot to get this bunny to hop
Got 'em lined up like (???)
My bank account on the rise, like Wal-Mart stock
Boys get it straight, I know you wanna see me touch my toes
With this mini skirt on, I can strike a fine pose
He droolin' at the mouth like he 4 months old
Here's a teethin' ring to bite, just to keep your grill closed
One thing for certain, two things for sho
I know you wanna see me do my thing on the floor

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)

He all in my ear sayin' I look like a model
Steady poppin' game when he should be buyin' bottles
I ain't a golddigger boy, but I got needs
I'm on some presidential shit and I ain't talkin' bout trees
Girls in my hood like boys with fat pockets
Straight drop game, and he know how to lock it
The new R-class benz, he already knew it
I ain't gotta ask for it, he just do it do it do it
I know what real money look like, and you ain't
Girl, don't never touch them toes 'til you verify the bank
Bottom line, if you wanna play with these toys
Do away with the games and bring the damn noise

He wanna see me bend over, bend bend bend over, bend bend bend over
And touch my toes (x4)
