(Chorus) x2
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

[VERSE 1: Nate Dogg]

I believe I got good skills
We been makin music since we were kids
Thats all I wanna do, for life
Keepin it real until the day I die
Obstacles get in my way
Continue to mash and dont forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride I'm thinkin negro please
If you really dont know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly
Yes sir this is DPG
Until the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look thats all I see
And I know...

[HOOK (2x)]
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

[VERSE 2: Nate Dogg]

Many women cling to me
I think its because they see me on BET
Cuz everybody knows my name
All the police think I'm serving cane
Jealous niggas call us out
But I dont worry long as I hear their mouths
If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared because I know I will
One thing I can guarantee
You dont wanna be standin next to me
Before my final curtain call
I forsake save hen and won't be long
So if we bump heads in the streets
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go...

[HOOK (2x)]
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

[VERSE 3: Daz]

Everyday, the 45 stays on deck for whoever
Im bustin takin down, bowin down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as these niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimpin everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep a dime from buying weed actin everytime
I smoke constantly, it comforts me
From commitin the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
Little John Gotti's layin niggas down at the homey's party
All be goin crazy I guess we are bein who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I blast then its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressin I'm guessin no confession
When the murder take place set yourself protection

[HOOK (4x)]

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound
