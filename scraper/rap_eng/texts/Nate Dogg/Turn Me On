[Intro: Ester Dean + Nate Dogg]
I wish upon a star
Finally, there you are
Dream love

I don’t mean to bother you but I was wondering (Can I turn her on?)
You make the temperature start to rise
Everytime you step into the room, O.M.G

[Dr. Dre, (Ester Dean + Nate Dogg)]
I must be something like an X pill
Bitches start touching themself and singing
(Everything about you turns me)
Everything about you turns me on (on
Wanna fuck you so bad right now)
It could of been the clothes or could of been the way that I'm a rolling stone
Or could of been the scent of a hundred million
Bitches smell when there’s (money in the air, money in the
Money in the air air air)

[Dr Dre]
7 stars must be my aura
A master levitation, I stay up in the clouds
Penthouse hovering a hundred floors up
I’m on some tantric yoga
The ladies love the way I (shine)
I’m like Merlin when I’m erotic
I make you squirm no hands on your body

[Dr. Dre, (Ester Dean + Nate Dogg)]
(Under my control anytime
Anytime I wanna make you hit the dancefloor
You already know what's my name)
So I ain't gotta spell it no more
I did it to the fullest I ain't gotta sell it no more
Tonight I’m looking for my biggest fans
She in the crowd singing my jam

(Everything about you turns me on)
Everything about you
(Everything about you turns me on)

(I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you so bad right now)
