[Verse 1]
Oh no, they call me Nate Dogg
Game don't wait but the girls all pause (You know me)
Bitch please, fall down to your knee
Keep That lovin' coming don't you take your love from me
Oh no, (oh no), look at who they let in the backdoor
Long Beach California but I think they already know
Same team, (same team), D-O-Double-G
Still roll with my doggs and yeah my doggs still roll with me
Maintain, (maintain), chiddy chiddy bang bang
Busy chasin' paper tryin' to fill my house up with grain
Lame dames, (lame dames), always fuck with my brain
I can find another women you can find another somebody like...

[Chorus]
Don't you wish you have you somebody
Don't you wish you could find you somebody
Don't you wish you have you somebody
Don't you wish you find you somebody like...me

[Verse 2]
She's a wild thing, kind of girl you can't change
You don't want to meet her father they say Lucifer's his name
She's strange, (she's strange), really hard to explain
Can't get caught up in this madness, can't get caught all up in this game
Bitch please, (bitch please), fall down to your knee
Been around the movie baby you can blow on me
Ain't right, (ain't right), I think you gonna be done at this time
If i'm not gettin' sex I think this time we're sayin' goodnight
I'm from Dogg Pound California where they always keep good smoke
Seed of Mississippi and I'm doin' this one for my folk
Homey, if you dissin' listenin' you might fucked around and get choked
I hoped you paid attention cause I won't be back no more

[Chorus] - 4X

(Somebody like me, somebody like me, somebody like me, somebody like me
Somebody like... somebody like me) {*echoes*}
