Consider this an invitation to my Gangsta Nation

Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five years I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here so what the fuck

Nigga, I'm tired of these niggas barkin' like shit talkin' like shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' like shit
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a dub S C thang dub C brain
(w)
And we don't fuck with niggas and khaki jeans strains
I'm fucked movin', I'm clearin' the crowd
It's the who bangin' bandana criminal
The original

Evacuate the building, bitch, here come a plane
No, it's the bad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you plain, nigga, this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear bitch insane
And we number one gunners, no, we ain't stunners
It's real with us homie, killaz and drug runners
And Mack need a beat now in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than a mothafuckin' L.A. summer
Let's go

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five years I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here, so what the fuck

What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin' about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy, I ain't gon' get
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre
(Uhh)
Bitch, you kinda scrangay
But I'm rich so my Andre got to be bomb rate

Have you seen us, naw, haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas sip notic by the liters
With a flock of pros on us 'cuz the cronic is a grennes
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bagin for the whole G Nation nigga

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five years I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here, so what the fuck

It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the C in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers, you don't ball like me
'Cuz I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlers and cluckers
Bangin' for the hood causin' havic and ruckus
You fools actin' label kissin' up ass suckers
And your trick solder down when you piss muthafucka

One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno
(You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a sick pussy, nigga you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
'Cuz it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na nna na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

Look, check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation goin' down over here
So ya'll might as well say fuck it and join this Westside thang man
Cause once you get with this nigga
You as G as can muthakuckin' be, believe' that homeboy
It's like that, Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit
(Na na na na na na na na)

This game right here is rough as fuck
