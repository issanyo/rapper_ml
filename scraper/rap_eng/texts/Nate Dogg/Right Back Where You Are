When my heart starts achin
Kinda hard to keep breathin
I take comfort in knowin
One day I'll be right back (right back where you are)
I keep starin at your picture
Lord knows I really miss ya
I wanna hug, I wanna kiss ya
Can't wait until I get back to (right back where you are)
I wish I had another chance too
All the things that I would tell you
Out of sight I'd never let you
Tell me how I can get to (right back where you are)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Right back, right back, right back, right back [2X]
Right back where you are

I remember how we used to
Sit and talk until the day's through
Now I've got no one to talk to
'Til I can get back to (right back where you are)
Sometimes I wonder did I tell you
How much I really love you
I know I'll get another chance to
When I'm standin right beside you (right back where you are)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm selfish
But if God would give me one wish
I'd wish you back into this world with
Me so I could be back (right back where you are)

[Chorus]
What a wonderful day
When my troubles are erased and
I'm so tired of waitin
My God I'll be facin
That wonderful day
My heart starts to racin
No more attempts at payin
Standin next to my savior, and (right back where you are)

[Outro]
Right back where you are
Where you arrrrrre
Right back where you are
Where you arrrrrre
Oh God where you are
Right back where you are
Where you are, where you are
Right back where you are...
Right back where you arrrre
Right back where you are
