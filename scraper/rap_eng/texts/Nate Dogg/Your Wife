[Hook]
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick
I fucked, that's it

[Verse 1]
All night long, I had her on her back in my Cadillac Brougham
You should of heard her moan, same old song
I made her throw her back out, then I sent her home
For better or worse she's

[Hook]
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick
I fucked thats' it
Straight pimp, no shit
Gave me your chips
I drove, your whip
It's true don't trip

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
What's my name, my name is Mr. Game
West coast big change Mr. Fame
Bad bitch scooped her up same ol' same
Fuckin in the drivers seat while I'm switching lanes
Gettin brains Long Beach, Compton thang
Shit ain't changed thats how we do the damn thang
Draws down nuts platinum, let em' hang
Wife missin 5 AM, who's to blame
I'm the reason used magnum is in your range
And while she bounced out wit me before you came
Fuckin lame you be handcuff sluts I banged
I trippin take em' back shit my nuts is drained
On everything this dick is shootin novocain
Have a bitch waitin bus stop, in the rain
Simple and plain cuz we's be off the chain
Nigga Nate Dogg, pimp game, please explain

[Verse 3]
Ring or no ring
A ho gon' be a ho
While you sleepin'
She be creepin' out the back door
Comin' to meet me at my honey comb
Smokin' and drinkin', dyin' to please me
While real playas keep playin' on

[Bridge]
Playas play on
Keep playin on
Ladies playin on, play on
Keep playin on
Playas play on, play on
Ladies play on, play on
Keep playin on
Your wife, is my bitch
Your love, is my trick

[Hook]
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick

Straight pimp, no shit
Gave me your chips
I drove, your whip
It's true don't trip
