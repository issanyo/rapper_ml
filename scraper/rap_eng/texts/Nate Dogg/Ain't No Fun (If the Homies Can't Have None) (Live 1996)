[Spoken Word Intro: Snoop Dogg]
What we missin'? Y'all don't know what we missin'?
What we missin'?
Pooh, hit 'em in they head
Yeah, yeah
(Give it up, it's a party in this motherfucker)
(It's a party in this motherfucker)
It's a party y'all
Wave your hands from side to side, c'mon
To the left, to the right
Wave your hands from side to side
To the left, to the right

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
('Cause yous a trick-ass bitch)
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call (Maybe)
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny (Biatch)
You can come on over (Ya know, ya know)
And I'll break you off (Everybody, everybody, c'mon)
And if you can't fuck that day baby (Sing that shit)
Just lay back and open your mouth
(Throw it up y'all, throw it up y'all, ain't no fun if my homies can't have none, throw i up)
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
(Oh shit, Kurupt the king)

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking (Indo to smoke)
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt hoe
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Chorus]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(C'mon, everybody sing that shit)
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(Up top, it don't stop)
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(C'mon, sing that shit)
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(I can't hear you, sing it)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love it

[Outro]
Uh, uh
I just don't love it man
I don't love it
Never did, boo-boo
