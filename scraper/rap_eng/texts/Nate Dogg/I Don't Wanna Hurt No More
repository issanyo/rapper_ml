[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
Man I been thinkin' lately
About the way the world just be changin'
Is it a sin to be chasin' paper?
I can't count the niggas dyin' lately
It's the grave or incarceration
I know you hurt but you can't replace em
You go and dig a hole then erase em
You just created a smaller nation
A jail cell is all that's waitin'
Look at all the progress you're makin'
I really hope you're kinda patient
You facin' 25 no probation
2 for 1 is multiplication
Your freedom is all they're takin
Is it best to be dead or pacin'
All 'cause you couldn't take it

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down

[Verse 2: Danny "Butch" Means]
How can I concentrate
With all the problems that I face
I often ask myself if there's a place
Where I can get away (Where I can get away)
I keep my head to the sky
And try to maintain my pace
If I don't then I'm gone
Somebody gone take my place
No need to go too fast
'Cause I know a little time it takes
But my situation's bad
I'll be jackin' soon at this rate
I ain't tryin' to make you mad
It's a plain and simple fact you face
If you're broke you hurt most
From all the bullshit you take

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
Lately I've been feelin' like givin' up (Don't give up)
The pain inside makes me wanna reach out and touch
Someone, anyone who feels that I ain't been hurt enough
You best duck or get stuck
'Cause man I been hurtin' for months
No more, no more, no more, no more
I've been hurtin' a while
No more, no more, no more, no more
And I don't wanna hurt no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Don't wanna hurt no more
But the rain keeps comin' down

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna hurt no more
I, but the rain keeps comin' down
