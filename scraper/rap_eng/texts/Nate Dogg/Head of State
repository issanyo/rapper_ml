Here's a story about a man
A simple man
A man with a dream
To do the world some good

Here's a story for rich and poor
For young and for old
About a man from the hood
Tryin' to do the world some good

Here's a story about a man
An everyday man
A man with a dream
To be the head of state

Here's a story about a man
An eveyday man
A man with the dream
To be the head of state, (state, state) (fade away)

He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go
What can you do when your feeling low
Man I wanna know

He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go
What can you do when your feeling low
And your car just got repoed

This is messed up, this realy sucks
Eveytime you do the hood trouble just pops up
He doesn't know what he's gonna do
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

This is messed up, this realy sucks
Keep your head up there's no respect
Let's just hope the elections not through
Let's just hope the elections not through

He feels good things are goin' his way
It just might be things are goin' his way
He feels good things are goin' his way
It just might be things are goin' his way

Look at him now man ain't this great
Biggest man in town he's the head of state
They come from all around just to one hand shake
Look at him now he's the head of state

To be the head of state, (state, state) (fade away)
To be the head of state
