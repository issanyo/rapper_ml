[verse 1: Eminem]
You've been patiently waiting

To make it through all the hate

Debating whether or not

You can even weather the storm

As you lay on the table

They operating to save you

It's like an Angel came to you

They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playin sick, they ain't shit They ain't sayin shit.. spray'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem you stayin wit me?
Dont let me lose you, Im not tryin to confuse you
When I let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message am I gettin through to you?
You know whatz comin you motherfuckerz dont even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killaz tied up in a knot
The Jugganautz of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this - nothin like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it iz az soon az Fifty signz on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cuz I get alot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (50 Cent: woo)- nuclear shower
Theres nothin spookier, you're now about to witness the power of


[verse 2: Eminem]


It's like a throne that he dont even own
He won't sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport
Runnin circles with the competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
And you can't love it you can hate it but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It
Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise
It ain't healthy To Be Makin Niggas Paranoid
Hit Your Corner With my weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin 120 On The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game


[verse 3: Eminem]

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
Was a fist that hit you...
