[Intro]

Yeah (He so cold)
That's right (He so cold)
Get money make money (He so cold)
Spend money watch money go (He so cold)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg] x2

The game (The game)
Keeps on calling (Keeps on calling)
Callin' You (You, You, You)

[Verse 1: Ric-A-Che]

I can recall my share of days of being broke (it was hard)
Did everything from laundering to selling dope
You couldn't cope nope
Threw me out your house and cussed me out
Ain't lost no love for you though cause i was down and out
I know i took the wrong route at times and chose crimes
Got paid for the nickel and dimes i cleaned 9's
Stuck with ? in denial about my drug use
Brews and blunts
My days was messed up in my younger youth
Living my life was hard
Supporting myself was harder
Especially when u got a son and daughter who calls you father
Just imagine if you was the last person living
Probably still wouldn't be free taking these mental pistol whippings

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2: Ric-A-Che]

My younger days was the best i was a mess
I must confess caused my mama stress running with the rest
Having to settle for less ?
My education and my dreams of having success
Wasn't compatible with others or the best dressed
Few friends, family members who loved me to death
See it was something bout the streets that drove me to em
Developed a close relationship with them felt that i knew em
At times even though they turned they backs on me
I find myself runnin back to em like a close homie
And my momma it seem like she don't even know me
But she never turned her back on me
Always loved me and been there for me
And she told me

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 3: Ric-A-Che]

When i wake up in the morning (he so cold)
In the evening (he so cold)
Even at night (he so cold)
When i'm out in the hood (he so cold)
When i'm up in the street (he so cold)
When there's nowhere to go (he so cold)
When your words are so cold (he so cold)
Hey! (Hey!)
? Kiss my son and my daughter
Thanks for the letters that you sent me and the money orders
At least it shows me that somebody out there thinking bout me
Seem like you, granny, and ya mama the only ones to write me
I'd like to thank my auntie ? for supporting me all these years
Cause all i gave you was headache, heartache, and tears
Hope one day i turn that frown into a smile
When i get the chance, im gonna turn my life around
But until then...

[Chorus] 4x
