[Intro - Nate Dogg]
I got love – I got love for my homies who be rollin wit me
Play no game – play no games cause ain't nobody playin wit me
I got love – I got love for my niggas on my family tree
I got love – love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before then you still gon' be down wit me
I got game – I got game cause the game was given to me
Say my name – say my name cause ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up – give it up if you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know – know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore – you ain't never listened to me
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (Livin’ the way we live)
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (Livin’ the way we live)
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh

[Verse 1 - K. Jayz]
If you know the I way I kicks it, you know I gotta be real
Them other niggas really on that bitch shit
You’d think they’d wanna finish a goal, accomplish it
Nah, these niggas fake, snitching just like bitches
Gimme the blunt so I can relax my head
So instead I don’t get a hit from the material, “lead”, or a hollow point
You know how these niggas do
They claim to be yo homie, then hit you with that .22
I’ma murder ya lyrically in your sleep since you niggas wanna sleep on me
I’m rappin’-attackin', the uzi explodes on niggas below
And everybody will now see my flow
What? You thought you could see me?
Motherfucker, you’ll never defeat me
Hop up in the car, roaming around the city
Looking for shit to do, and bitches with big titties and orgasms
You know how the shit play
We never love hoes, but we could fuck for days
Take a hit from the marijuana
Be like Fanta cause I know you wanna
And in my past days I had a hella lot of haters
But nowadays, they wanna hit me up
Nah, I’ll see ya later
I’m only tryna fuck with my dogs and fuck with the team
And make it to day when I can say “all eyes on me”
Have my shit on repeat, get radio play
And for the niggas on my nuts, I have to go ahead and say
I can’t be faded, you niggas cannot fuck with me
I can’t be faded, you niggas cannot fuck with me
I can’t be faded, you niggas cannot fuck with me
I can’t be faded, you niggas cannot fuck with me

[Hook - Nate Dogg & K. Jayz]
I got love
I got love for the niggas who keep it 100 with me
Say my name
Say my name whenever you see me on the street
Everybody fuckin’ with me
Give it up
Give it up if you like the way I’m rockin’ this beat
If you know the way we live and still think that we give a fuck about ya
You ain’t never listen to me
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (Livin’ the way we live)
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (Livin’ the way we live)
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh

[Verse 2 - Nate Dogg]
Platinum chains – platinum chains is all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring – diamond ring as long as I can keep every check
All the same – all the same as long as you don't ever forget
When these hoes – hoes get clever, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I’ll leave the heffer dead in the street
Funny how – funny how the haters they be all in the mix
When they know – when they know it ain’t gon’ get no better than this
Can’t they see – can’t they see we ain’t some niggas they wanna diss
D.P.G. – Will I love a trick? Never
Treat a bitch? Never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin’ with me
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[Hook]

[Outro - Nate Dogg]
