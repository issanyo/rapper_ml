[Verse]
I got love, I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin with me
Play no game, play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin with me
I got love, I, got, love, for my homies on my family tree
I got love, love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, then you still gon’ be down with me
I got game, I, got, game, 'cause, the game was given to me
Say my name, say, my, name, 'cause, ain’t nobody tighter than me
Give it up, give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rocking this beat
I don't know, know nuttin' better, chasin' my chedder
If you in, you ain't never listened to me

[Build Up]
I got love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love....
Know nuttin' better, chasin' my chedder
You ain’t never listened to me
I got love

[Drop]
Know nuttin’ better, chasin' my chedder
You ain’t never listened to me
I got love
Know nuttin' better, chasin' my chedder
You ain't never listened to me
I got love
