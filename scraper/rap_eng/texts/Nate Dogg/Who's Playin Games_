[Verse]
Just in case you didn't know, I blow (I blow)
Constantly for dough
I'm sittin' next to my heat (my heat)
Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, all night long
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, until we go
Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jherri curls
When you could always spot a gangsta
By the way his hair outgrew his girl's
There lived a little boy who wore khakis every day
He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
Got them same ol' gangsta ways
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
And I ain't the one to get played

[Chorus]
Who's playin' games? Man I really hope you burn
Who's playin' games? When I'm gonna get my turn
Who's playin' games? I don't wanna be left out
Who's playin' games? You playin'
