(Soulja Boy Tell Em)

Its time to do my dance, pullin up my pants, posted on the dance flo in my pimpin stance
It ain't the same thang do my dance is a stinga, you gotta rock smoothly and pull ya trigga finga
I'm wild on da dance flo, yea I got fans, I'm doin poole palace and dey lookin at my hands
I'm bout to do my dance, but naww you can't stop that, I crank my dance up and then I let my Glock cock back

[Chorus]
I see em on the dance flo, don't know how to act, tryna crank my dance but that dance don't match
Soulja Boy up on da scene you know its firred up, Hold Up Wait A Minute Whind Me Up
I'm gettin buck, and yeen know, 'cause imma crank the shuffle and then do the mary-go
I tell em stance on deck (YEP), dance on deck (YEP), fo all y'all who hate, I got hands on deck

[Chorus]
After ya get real low then rock on ya toes, rock side to side and do yo dance on da flo
Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout)
After ya get real low then rock on ya toes, rock side to side and do yo dance on da flo
Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout), Nah Shootout (shootout)

[Chorus]
[Leading Halfway to End at Fast Pace]
