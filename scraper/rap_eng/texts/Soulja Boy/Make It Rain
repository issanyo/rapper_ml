[Outro]
Yaah, soulja
Heey

[Hook]
I just spent 10 on a whole thang
Ridin through the city and the car swang
10 thousand dollars for my pinky ring
And she all on me cause' I'm in the game
I just spent 10 for the whole thang ya, make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain

[Verse 1]
I just spent 20 for the whole thang
Call on my jeweller that's a new chain
In a lamborghini and I'm switching lanes
And your girl on me cause' I'm in the game
It ain't nothing to me I just make it rain
She just drop it down while I'm switching lanes
She just twirl everywhere I'm gettin' cake
Every club I'm hitting on I'm getting cake getting cake

[Hook]
I just spent 10 on a whole thang
Ridin through the city and the car swang
10 thousand dollars for my pinky ring
And she all on me cause' I'm in the game
I just spent 10 for the whole thang ya, make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain

[Verse 2]
She just all on me cause my ice chain
She wanna fuck my car she wanna fuck my rims
She wanna suck my chain
She in love with my ring
I just hit the block and I make it rain
Shout out to the squad shout out to the gang
Pull up to the club and I fire flame
Spent a 100 thousand on a cuban link

[Hook]
I just spent 10 on a whole thang
Ridin through the city and the car swang
10 thousand dollars for my pinky ring
And she all on me cause' I'm in the game
I just spent 10 for the whole thang ya, make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain
