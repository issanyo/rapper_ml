[Verse 1]
Who the fuck is this bitch tryna diss up on Big Soulja
Big Soulja is the Soldier
Girl you have no idea who you're fuckin' with
You made more money then him, that's just a myth
Made 30M's you're not even at one
Searched you on CNW, you could not be found
Fucked her in her throuth, Kodak did a good work
Stacks On Decks Money Gang, bitch
Know That we pull up, we come with them dracos
Go empty the clip, right in the street
Kodak a healthy kid, he smokes broccoli
So he sent you to the doctor
He took all the money of the show
"Fuck You!" Bitch you have to grow, you're to slow
Said some stupid shit and now you blow, you glow
Stupid bih' gon' fade, it's gonna go
Talkin' 'bout Kylie, your begging since you blew
Talk shit now the crew will come on you, hope you knew
Begging for atention, now beefed with Big Soulja
We are gonna come on your block, with the Draco
Mini draco shooting through your front door
Im all the way in Toronto smoking gelato
Came up on a hundred bricks, I hit the lotto
Went and bent a bentley, they I bought a gelato
You Know the lawyer beat the case
Smokin' Gelato, I'm high in the space
Yeah, You know we run up them pesos
Yeah, I run up them pesos

[Verse 2]
Saw you flexin' in Kodak's Wraith
We get any girl we want, we don't gotta rape
You was hiddin' 1 dollar bills in your stack
We don't have that on the deck, who are you tryna finesse?
Rockin' with Iphone5 and fake chains, KYS
Call Quavo, and you might get the address
(That for a suck tho)
You enter the community through the first gate
You'll gonna get shot before the second gate(Sike!)

[Verse 3]
You was born, You're momma is regrettin'
The dick is easy for you gettin'
I bet Kodak on you pettin'
The cum on you is jettin'
We came from trappin' and cappin'
Lettin' that hair grow
I'm bettin' it's wettin' and sweatin'
Bitch you bought a 2k strip pole
Fuck with you is like diggin' for coal
Kodak hittin' that shit so hard yelling "GOAL"
Ran 4 times from home, and praise
Bitch too stupid, got found all times(Ouch!)
Went to Dr. Phil and laughing like so funny
After, you got in custody, I was laughing like so funny
Now you got out, saying you're the same
But, did that just to continue the fame
For real, you was put to silence
You're the same as the line from Pilonce
"Your Pylon to success"
That being Dr. Phil and Kodak
You got blessed!
