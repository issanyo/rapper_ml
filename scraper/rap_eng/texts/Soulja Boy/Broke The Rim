[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Man you know what the fuck going on, man
NBA in the trap nigga
Fuck these niggas talking about, man
Get the fuck out the way and [?]

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Mixing Margiela and some MCM
Standing in the trap jumping out the gym
In the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
Fifty bricks later Soulja broke the rim
Broke the rim, I done broke the rim
Ballin' so hard, I done broke the rim
Broke the rim, broke the rim
Slam dunk, alley oop, broke the rim

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Soulja tell 'em going in
Stand in the trap and I jump out the gym
With my wrist whip a 10
Fuck with the fish and I'm making it swim
Thirty bricks in the pool
Young nigga riding around with the tool
Try to ride you a fool
Pussy nigga you get it, what it do
All my niggas know they ready
Tote a new choppa like I'm [?]
All of my niggas get deli
AK-47 my favorite weapon
Fuck with my niggas they shoot
22 bricks and it's all in the roof
Young Soulja know imma shoot
Riding around in a brand new coupe
Fifty-thousand in the back way
Thousand dollars on the Versace ash tray
Hop out the 'rari, the fat lane
Two pistols and I feel like Max Payne
Shoot a nigga his damn brain
SOD Gang all on my damn chain
Nigga knowing what it is
Jump out the gym and I'm breaking the rim

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Mixing Margiela and some MCM
Standing in the trap jumping out the gym
In the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
Fifty bricks later Soulja broke the rim
Broke the rim, I done broke the rim
Ballin' so hard, I done broke the rim
Broke the rim, broke the rim
Slam dunk, alley oop, broke the rim

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Counting up money yeah, real street nigga
In that motherfucking 'rari do the dash nigga
Hundred thousand duffel bag, everything cash nigga
If you ain't getting no money, you ain't gon last nigga
Bad bitches on me
Bad bitches want me
Young trap nigga gotta focus on the money
Pull up in the Lamborghini, niggas looking funny
When the sun hit my chain, it will blind your doney
Thirty thousand on me nigga all I do is swag
Fifty thousand on the tag, put that on the tab
Young rich nigga flexing, put that on the gang
Buy new ring, ear ring and new chain
Gucci, Burberry, Fendi on my shoe strings
Niggas too lame
Niggas play games
I'm in that white Bentley thang, in the turning lane
I'm with your main thang, and she giving brain

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Mixing Margiela and some MCM
Standing in the trap jumping out the gym
In the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
Fifty bricks later Soulja broke the rim
Broke the rim, I done broke the rim
Ballin' so hard, I done broke the rim
Broke the rim, broke the rim
Slam dunk, alley oop, broke the rim

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
