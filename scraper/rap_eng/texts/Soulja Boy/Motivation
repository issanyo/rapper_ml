[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Choppa eatin' up your face
Call my lawyer, beat the case
Lamborghini win the race
Young nigga high in the space
You lil niggas livin' soo broke
You lil niggas look like a joke
I walk in the trap with 'em Rolls
I play with the pot on the stove
We gettin' the pint by the cases
We shippin' just send your location
I'm givin' the trap motivation
All we need is motivation
I'm givin' the trap motivation
I'm givin' the hood motivation
A quarter mill one week
All we need is motivation

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Hold up Soulja man they ain't real
Walk in the trap house I see fetti on fetti
Fuck nigga reachin' for my chain
I pull out that DRACO and send him straight up to heaven
I stack me a brick and I pour up to the store
Call up 'em shooters they kick in your door
Grab me a pint and I pour up a four
I got 'em bricks, they underneath the floor
Took a bitch fuck the NFL season
My diamonds dancin' like Chris Breezy
Get to the money and the Cuban link on me blingin'
Fuckin' your bitch an I make it look easy
I'm the flyin' nigga, ain't no extinguishin'
Sippin' on lean and my chain had a fever
Post in the trap and I'm servin' the ether
Hollow tip bullets in my Desert Eagle
Pull up on your nigga send me location
I had to make it, I went back to the trap with 'em cases
Come with the fetti, choppas they ready
We pull up on your block, Armageddon
Lamborghini, that's an arm and a leg
Drop the dime on a fuck nigga head
Shoot a nigga til the fuck nigga dead
Soulja Caleon, King Cortez

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Choppa eatin' up your face

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Uh, got a choppa in the Wraith
Uh, take a pint to the face
Money long like miles
Young nigga, I roll with the fire
New Ferrari with a red Benz
Cook it up with a broke wrist
We pull up still sippin' that Actavis
I got plenty shooters on our faculty
Yeah that way
Meetin' the plug on the freeway
She bring it back like a DJ
2 hoes have a threeway
Check came in, turn my neck to a blizzard
Count up a 100, my hand got a splinter
Whip up a chicken and 60 for diner
Bro runnin', got the bricks in the fender
I am the king and the face on 'em
Look at my ring, that's spring water
14s on the way, more water than a lake
Your diamonds they cloudy, ain't shin'
These niggas they copy behind me
Young nigga keep flexin'
That's a choppa not a Smith & Wesson

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Choppa eatin' up your face
Call my lawyer, beat the case
Lamborghini win the race
Young nigga high in the space
You lil niggas livin' soo broke
You lil niggas look like a joke

All we need is motivation
I'm givin' the trap motivation
I'm givin' the hood motivation
