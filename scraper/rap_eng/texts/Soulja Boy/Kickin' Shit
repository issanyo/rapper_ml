[Verse 1]
Shorty lookin' righter now
I'm sippin' lean and smokin' loud
Too turnt up, can't turn me down
Taste all turned, can't turn me down
In the cloud with the loud pack
We in the bed rollin' up some backs
Nigga know but I keep real nacks
I said nigga know I keep real nacks
Juice deuce pulled up a 4
Fuck the po but quiet draw
Stank bomb wherever we go
Stank bomb wherever we go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pullin' up, panorama I'm kickin' shit
Flex so hard, VIP we in this bit
Smokin' loud, we smokin' loud, we smokin' strong
Shorty got a juicy booty, what it do?
Turn around and I'mma make it rain like hell
Turn around and I'mma make it rain right now
Shorty know what's up, man it's going up
Yea it's going up and it's going down
I walked in the club you know I got allowed
Gold chain up on my neck, I'm turnin' up
Gold on my bracelet, I'm turnin' up
Gold on my pinky ring, I'm turnin' up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I think shorty wanna do me
Ride through my city she's a groupie
But shorty kinda juicy
And I'm kickin' shit in some movie
Kickin' shit, all in Las Vegas
All from the city but I'm turnt up with my playas
All from the city and we tuned up on them haters
All from the city and we smokin' different flavors
Young nigga still tag this
Young post it up and sav it
Going on and on, we can have it
On kickin' shit, on kickin' shit
Bitch, I kick the shit

[Hook]
