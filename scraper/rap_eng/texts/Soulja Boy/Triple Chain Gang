Triple chain, that's my trio
I got two hoes, I'm with my trio

And I come through three or four chains that's three though (that's three though)

Circus or wait line jumping through hoops and shit
Niggas riding coupes and shit
Niggas droppin' roofs and shit
Niggas doing shit and moving shit, I come through, I'm just proving it
God damn, I think that I'm that nigga
God damn I'm the man, get my young niggas pull triggers
And you suck me fuck records, not lucky
Come through, dirty dick, extendo, hunny

Voodoo
Three chain shit
