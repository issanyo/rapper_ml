They see me on the stage they say I'm guaped down
50k upon my neck say I'm guaped down
Riding in that foreign whip, they say I'm guaped down
10 chains 10 rings, say I'm guaped down
Say I'm guaped down, say I'm guaped down
Say I'm guaped down, say I'm guaped down
10 chains, 10 bricks, say I'm guaped out
10 rangs, 10 whips, say I'm guaped out
10 chains 10 rings, say I'm guaped down
Pull up in the green lambo like what now
Bands in my pocket, belt faragamo
I be cooking bricks, I be making'
Breaking down the brick, turn a brick to...
And I'm riding with the hunned round drum
Soulja boy he say he got what you need
I be on kush and codeine
I be stacking bricks in my dreams
I be hitting licks cause I'm a king
Young dre, he rock a Jesus piece
Gucci on my hand, louie v my sleeve
Pull up to the hood I cop it by the 3
You know what they say that dealt cause in 3's
So I suicide my whip, suicide my chain, suicide my rang
Lil dre soulja boy the king

I'm standing on this set they say I'm guaped down
50k upon my neck say I'm guaped down
Riding in that foreign whip, they say I'm guaped down
10 rangs, 10 whips, say I'm guaped out
Say I'm guaped down, say I'm guaped down
Say I'm guaped down, say I'm guaped down
10 chains, 10 bricks, say I'm guaped out
10 rangs, 10 whips, say I'm guaped out
10 chains 10 rings, say I'm guaped down

Pull up panamera, and a nigga flexin
Yeah I call this shit, soulja super flexin
God on neck, diamond in my vic
And I make it rain, cause I got a check
Y'all little flicks, young guaped down
Young guaped out, when I'm on town
When I'm on your head, when I'm in my bed
Pull up when I hit the vip... lego
And I take the baking soda, and I slang cheese
And I hit the client door, and I order whip
Guaped down, riding down the vegas strip
Big ass pistol hanging off my hip
Young dre rocka rap rollin with the k
Faragamo on my belt I coped it yesterday
Ak 47 and I throw away
Guap, maine

I'm standing on this set they say I'm guaped down

Riding in that foreign whip, they say I'm guaped down
