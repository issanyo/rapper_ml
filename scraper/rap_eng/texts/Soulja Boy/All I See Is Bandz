All I see is bandz
All I see is lotta bandz
All I count is bandz, all I count is bandz
All I see is a lot of bandz
All I see is a lot of bandz
All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz

[Verse 1:]
Rolex on my wrist, that cost me 3 chickens
Catch me in my Scarface mansion and I'm water whippin
Ridin through my city and you know I keep that pistol
Soulja Boy official, official like a whistle
Niggas hatin on me then I make er fuckin pop
I'm ridin through my city screamin motherfuck the cops
Every other day Soulja Boy be on the block
Niggas think they fuckin with me but they really not
Ridin through my city with the toolie, fuck the ops
We do this every day, shout out to my nigga Hox
Pull that pistol, make a nigga goin hopscotch
My ice on cool, ice on froze, bitch I got guap

[Hook:]
All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz
All I see is bandz, All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz
All I count is bandz
All I see is bandz
All I see is bandz, All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz

[Verse 2:]
Flooded, touchdown, clip point, gunplay
G5, takin off the runway
Goddamn, Soulja Boy is so paid
It ain't nothing to me, I Louis V my shade
Niggas still hate but it's not a problem
AK-47 in the thrower way revolver
Man I thought I told ya
Call me big Soulja, black Range Rover
AK under the neath the couch unless he want the pressure
My lil niggas oppress him, ridin down Gresham
Finessin and flexin, bad bitch textin
You in a fuckin Lexus, I pull up Bugatti
2 pistols on my... you know what it is
2 ounces on my dick, you know what it is
We bout our bizz, catch us in the fields
SOD money gang, I do it for real

[Hook:]
All I see is bandz
All I see is bandz
All I see is bandz, All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz
All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz
All I see is bandz, All I see is bandz
All a nigga is bandz
