We dropping bars like baghdad the plug coming in and we snatched it
Bitch on the wall go ahead I’m on a roll
Graffiti finishing approved for everything you got

Oh shit its the worst i got the flu
Hot out the barban and jump in the coop
We put your face on a shirt and then
Put your face on the news rest in peace
I pull up in a rari I’m blood but I’m in blue
You know how it is chopper hit a nigga straight ahead
Looking like a dill i pull out the lumber I’m out of here

You niggers are lost a hundred thousand when i trip on my lawn

Nigga knows I’m getting money nigga know I’m getting cake
Frows gold on my belt all gold everything
You step out on the sand

Fuck with my squad and we going to shoot you up
