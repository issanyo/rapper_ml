[Intro:]
I like it when we on the beach
Let’s go to the beach
To the beach yea
Baby let’s go into the beach yea
Hey

[Chorus:]
She likes the way I’m cruising through the streets yea
I told her baby let’s go to the beach yea
I like it when we go to the beach
Beach [x10]
She like the way I cruise the streets ye
I said baby let’s go to the beach yea
Beach [x10]
Going through the streets
Told her baby let’s get going to the beach
Lets hit the beach
Let’s go to the beach
Let’s hit the beach
Let’s go to the beach

[Verse 1:]
Unless we free
She finds DD on the beach
I pull off all these jeans
Rich game I see
I cannot leave
I cannot dream
Hit her from the back
Ain’t no she scream
And I’m in between
Killin her x4
Killing her eating her with cream
Whipping it X3
I whip like whip cream
My diamonds are shining they look like ice cream
When it all on me
I fuck her and she gonna scream
I’m all in her dream
I get in between
I got her sniff the weed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Your boyfriend he lame and you know it
Your boyfriend he lame and you know it
You don’t even know where we going, no
And that money he don’t blow it, Oh
He lame, ass is lame
Look at my chain
Rich game
Fast lane
Cash money 2015

[Chorus]
