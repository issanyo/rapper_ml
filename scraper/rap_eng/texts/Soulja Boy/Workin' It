[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm workin' it
I'm workin' it [x6]

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
You know that I'm workin'
You know that my niggas they servin'
I'm pullin up swervin'
Come to my trap and I'm servin'
Dunk a brick just like Kyrie Irving
Lotta my nigga comin' know they in person
The bitches love me I look better in person
Hop in that lambo you know that I'm swervin'
Hop on the track and you know that I'm cursin'
Flippin' them bricks man you know how I do
Hop out the rarri and swerve in the coupe
Pourin' up lean, you know I got juice
Shootin at niggas, mothafuck the truth
Pourin' up fours and pourin' up deuce
Mazaradi came with no roof
SOD gang, know that my crew
Smokin' on dope pourin' lean with the bluetooth

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm workin' it
I'm workin' it [x6]
