Hey, Dem 30/30 Boyz, Soulja Boy and Arab

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about the life
And how you live when you is a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk, and everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a handshake, or want a high five
And these ugly girls always got a friend
That wants to talk to you
(Bitch, Yahhh, Yahhh, Trick)
(And your friend, Yahhh, Yahhh Too!)
Ain't got time for chitchat
I'm tryin to get this money
So get up out my face
You shit-breath dummy

[Verse 2]
Dawg, get out my face, I'm startin' to get mad

Leave me alone, let me get some peace
I'm sittin at the house and a nigga can't sleep
Leave me alone ho, before I have to knock your ass out
