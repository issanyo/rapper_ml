Whoooop [3x]

Let's get money nigga
Chain gang

On the battlefield
Overseas of Paris, Karl Lager field
I'm Karl Lager field

On the battlefield
Karl Lager field
Bitch I'm Karl Lager field

Out of here and I got it
Money up in my wallet
Pull up in VIP
These niggers know that I got it
Niggers know that I shot it
Word around we ball out

That bad bitch that might call out
Real nigga might fall through

She suck me, we were in the train
Yah nigga, choo-choo
Fuck you and your whole block

Pulled up stretched limousine

Niggers asking for it

Oh the new McLaren
CLR twenty twelve I'm there
Little Dre, what you heard

Little Dre, as B's
Ice chain, it's easy

I got soldiers
On the battlefield
Overseas of Paris, Karl Lager field
I'm Karl Lager field
Karl Lager field

On the battlefield
Karl Lager field
Bitch I'm Karl Lager field
Karl Lager field

Watch your mouth before you speak nigga
It ain't really hard to a street nigga
And I'm riding up the street nigga
Whole car hot cause we towing heat nigga
Never disrespect I've been a boss
Fifty thirteen pull up with the top off
Can it pain like Mac sauce
Nigga knowing I'm a knock them off
Bitch nigga this my fucking year
Pictures down then we get them out of here
Nigga getting money in his fucking sleep
Overseas you came and mince your heat

I got soldiers
On the battlefield
Overseas of Paris, Karl Lager field
I'm Karl Lager field
Karl Lager field
I got soldiers
On the battlefield
Karl Lager field
Bitch I'm Karl Lager field
Karl Lager field
