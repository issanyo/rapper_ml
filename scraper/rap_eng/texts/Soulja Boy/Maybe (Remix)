[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
My bitch the baddest, it may be the statis
Maybe my Astin, maybe black magic
Maybe I'm destand, maybe it's blessings
Maybe my cubans just got me connected
I may be the best, no second guessing
I go get them checks, I be the freshist
Boots cost a stack, that's just 10 hundreds
I never subtract, I been 100

[Verse 2: Rocko]
M A Y B E, I'm fly
That's why I got your bitch with me right now
She say she not bi, so I told her bye
She say ok, maybe I'll try
Maybe cause she know, she know I'm that guy
Or maybe cause I get all this m o n e y
Or maybe it's my oral, got her blowin up my team
Blinga bling, yello all on my ding a ling
Maybe cause I'm on, they wanna scrue me
Maybe it's that new shit, got them throwing that cucci
Maybe cause she heard I slang that wood very good
Maybe that's why she staring, maybe that's why she ready to do it

[Hook: Rocko]
Maybe it's my car, maybe cause I'm flexin
Maybe it's my wrist, bitch, got the bitch getting naked
Maybe it's my bracelet, maybe it's my chain
Maybe it's my swagger, got your bitch off the chain
Maybe cause I'm on, maybe it's my guns
Maybe it's my calone, got your bitch wanna fuck me
Maybe it's the way I'm thuggin, like the way we be kicken it
Maybe it's all this money, she like the way we getting it

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
She on my wave like a surf board, I'm swang, I'm overboard
That lady ain't lay up, signed the rrent to the landloard
I'm gwapped up, stay gwapped up
So much bread, it's a lunch
I go wherever you go, black card in your circle
Yeah, that's that attention defesit, got ATT, I got ETT
With Rocko, cause he ADD, if you ain't a dime piece then don't speak to me
I'm in that drop, no simpothy
If you ain't got a range, then don't speak to me
Over ice, got polar ice, my pinckey ring liking like chorus light
Me and Rocko, we robbin, make them hate me, no maybe
Keep buying these fararis like I'm crazy, cause I'm crazy
You said you my baby, no yes or probably or maybe
Wanna be with Radrick Davis, no probably, no maybe
It's Gucci!

[Hook: Rocko]
Maybe it's my car, maybe cause I'm flexin
Maybe it's my wrist, bitch, got the bitch getting naked
Maybe it's my bracelet, maybe it's my chain
Maybe it's my swagger, got your bitch off the chain
Maybe cause I'm on, maybe it's my guns
Maybe it's my calone, got your bitch wanna fuck me
Maybe it's the way I'm thuggin, like the way we be kicken it
Maybe it's all this money, she like the way we getting it

[Verse 4: Soulja Boy]
Pull up in that drop, that money, man, I'm spendin it
What's on my credit card, you know that thing unlimmited
Told you tell them I blow it, I'm turned up to the maximom
Shaudy wanna lick me, look at how my diamonds flexin
Ball out in the club, fuck all them lame niggas
But they gonna wanna touch, maybe I bust their brain, nigga
Me and Rocko, you know we doing it big time
ATL on deck, we goin shine bout 10 times
Go tell m, westside, that be my naiborhood
Dropped on that grill, these days, my drop top's legs are wood
Phantom all on froze, shout out to my brother Gucci
So tell m that's how it goes, we shoot a movie

[Hook: Rocko]
Maybe it's my car, maybe cause I'm flexin
