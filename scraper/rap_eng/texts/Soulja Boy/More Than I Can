Countin' up 2million dollars cash right now
Soulja, aye SODMG
It's that new shit

I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

[Verse 1]
I'm talking Lambo's, Hummer Trucks, Bentleys and all of that
Pulling up Mercades at the parting jet
Its Lil' Dre AKA Soulja Boy Tellem
Two mill off a tour somebody get em
Everyday we hustle and we hustle hard
You ain't got the check put it on a fucking card
Niggas show respect cause a nigga living large
Respect the hustle pulling up like El Debarge
All white everthing in the parling lot
Nigga drop the top in the parking lot
Mixtape dropped and its downloaded
Kush in my lungs damn near exploaded
Fake rappers around damn near exposed them
Lil' Dre everything on me frozen
20 karats Bugs Bunny mad at me
10 chain 5 ring the swag daddy

I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

[Verse 2]
I got million dollar thoughts
You can hear it in my voice dog
Hear it in my raps
You can hear it in my chorus dog
Pulled up drop top
Panamera Porsche dog
Everbody looking at me
Soulja Boy done went hard
Yeah I done went ham
Doors up don't slam
Real shit
I done came out
Going ham
Young Dre
And I ain't ever going back
Made it out my situation
Now Im smoking loud pack
Million after million
Buck after buck
Every dollar counts
So I'm stacking that shit up
Come in to my mansion
I got cash to the ceiling
Its the money making mission
And I put that on the building
S. O. D. Money Gang
Tell the feel it
Tatted up my whole chest
Felxing my campaign
S O D got damned
Ten racks
I made it rain
Two straps
In the rap game
I'm Max Payne

I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought
