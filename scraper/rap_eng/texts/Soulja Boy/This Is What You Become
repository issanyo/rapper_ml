[Intro]
Tell 'em dot TV
Soulja Boy tell 'em, easy

[Chorus]
After hard work, after the long grind
This is what you become
All the long nights, all the broke days
This is what you become
This is what you become

[Verse]
My name Soulja Boy tell 'em
I'm a legend in my hood, let's do it
I been hustling since 1999 back in 99 I had 99
Money on my mind, lotta letters declined
Now I'm in my prime, young mastermind
Blood, sweat and tears, I shredded all the years
Blood, sweat and tears, I shredded all the years
When I look in the mirror, swag in the mirror
Cash in the mirror, glass in the mirror
Soulja Boy tell 'em, or you can call me Beezy
You whole pound of kush just too leady
Now bitch leave me or bitch join me
S.O.D Army, all the hoes want me
All the hoes want me, all the hoes love me
All the hoes kiss me, all the hoes hug me
All the hoes nothing, nothing but trouble
Money mo problems, they come in dozens
They come in with cousins, sisters and brothers
They come in the kitchen, they come in to mug you
They come in to sign you, they come in to find you
They come in to front you, they come in behind you
And if you forgot, let me remind you
I'm coming to get it, I want all the loot
Man I'm so fly I got a Gucci parachute
With the matching boots, pow!

[Chorus]
After hard work, after the long grind
This is what you become
All the long nights, all the broke days
This is what you become
After hard work, after the long grind
This is what you become
All the long nights, all the broke days
This is what you become
This is what you become
