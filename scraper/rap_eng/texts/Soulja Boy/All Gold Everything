[Intro: Young L]
Yeah, uh
Ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (L-G-N-D)
Ayy

[Chorus: Young L & Soulja Boy]
All gold, all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything (yeah)
All gold (yeah), all gold everything (swag!)
All gold, all gold everything
All gold (Soulja!), all gold everything

[Verse One: Soulja Boy]
All gold everything, I’m pretty boy thugging
So much smoke in my lungs, damn near crashed the Cutlass
Standing on the red carpet in my favorite Jordans
That type of shit that make a nigga feel so important
Pull up to the park, I bet a young nigga stunt
Twenty pills in my pocket, nigga, going dumb (Soulja!)
All about my cash supply and my dividends
Y’all some penny-pinchers that’s fucking up the middle-man
Twenty bowls of dirty kush ‘cause I got a check
Gold Cuban Link hanging off my fucking neck
Gold four-finger-ring (huh?) because I show finesse
If a ho touch my dick, then the ho blessed, more money to count
Ain’t no stress!

[Chorus: Young L & Soulja Boy]
All gold, all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything
All gold (uh-huh), all gold everything
All gold, all gold everything (hol’ up, hol’ up huh)

[Verse Two: Young L]
Ayy! You know your bitch already know
About this gold shit we rocking (uh-huh)
Take them chains out, we to blame ‘cause bad hoes be flocking
Kept chain oversized (size), ice solarized (ayy)
I’m bipolarized by this gold and this ice (bitch!)
I’m hot (uh), I’m cold (uh), I’m vivrant, I’m what you, what you
Tarnished, garbage, I’m the hot shit, 24K, nigga, you heartless
All gold chain (yeah), all gold ring (ill)
Finna go to Spain and get a all-gold brain, see (bitch!)
Niggas thinking gold shit, you niggas wearing old shit
Just copped me some more shit, I put your bitch in motion
Sipping potion; see my gold, now she sucking on it
Hear my shit go down her throat (*ccck!*) now she choking on it

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
All gold, all gold everything (yeah)
All gold (yeah), all gold everything (swag!)
All gold, all gold everything
All gold (Soulja!), all gold everything
