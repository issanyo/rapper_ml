[Intro]
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Diamonds still drippin'
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm still whippin'
Whip, whip, whip, still whippin'
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm still whippin'

[Verse One]
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Went to the mall, cashed out sixty
Sixty racks, one day, Soulja [?]
Coolin', penthouse at the fuckin' [?]
Hopped out all white cocaine Bentley
Ridin' through the city, stackin' Milli's
Word around town, Fendi ceilings
Word around town, Dre still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Ice in my ear
Yeah, I'm still drippin'
And the fuckin' word that I'm still pimpin'
Ice on my ear
Man, I'm still whippin'

[Chorus]
Whip, whip, still whippin'
Whip, whip, still whippin'
In and out of traffic, still whippin'
One kilo, diamonds still drippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
In and out of traffic, boy, I'm still whippin'
In and out of traffic in a new Bentley
In and out the city, boy, I'm still whippin'

[Verse Two]
Private jet fly over the damn city
Ride through the clouds
Come and fly with me
Off the pound, smokin' gettin' high with me
Bad ass bitch wanna ride with me
Young Soulja worth 25 milli'
Word around town, we go ham for 'em
I got some bricks, like a backboard
Twelve try to pull me over, they gonna need backup
I got them bricks, yeah, they transport
Catch me in that foreign, slidin' through the cut
I done seen it all, they locked my partner up
He made 300,000 straight out the mud
And I swerve Bentley coupes to the club
Still whippin', still shootin' shit up

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
Yeah, I'm still whippin'
In and out of traffic, boy, I'm still whippin'
