[Hook]
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking and I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Bitch I do my thing, bitch I do my thing
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking and I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Molly with that lean, bitch I do my thing

[Verse 1]
Molly with that lean rolling through the streets
Man I do my thing, boy I stay clean
Boy you know I’m packing, y'all boys playing
Pull up in that Porsche, like what you really saying
Do this every day, day do this all the time, time
Man I’m on my hustle, Man I’m on my grind
In a big time, say I’m in a big league
Oh no, on the stage and you in the VIP
Oh man I’m in the streets, man I’m in your fucking girl
Take her to the crib, molly world, molly world
With that lean, with that lean, with that smoke, with the smoke
I’m on a yacht, I’m on a boat

[Hook]

[Bridge]
With that lean, lean
With that lean, molly with that lean
Molly with that lean, with that lean
With that lean, molly with that lean
Molly with that lean

[Verse 2]
On a bean, struggling out the club
Stumbling looking for my keys, keys
Hopped inside the Porsche swerving oh I'm on freeze
Rolex on my wrist, hold it up if you paid
It’s Rolex gang, gang
That's what I claim, I pull up 20 racks in my pocket
Water running with the lean like a faucet
I'm getting money and you niggas can’t stop it,can't stop it
You can’t stop it, can’t stop it
Say I’m a king, I’m a king
All the girls in the club say I’m clean, say I’m clean
I wake up in the morning do my thing,do my thing
And your girlfriend right here, she on a bean,she on a bean,she on a bean
Molly with the lean, with the lean
Molly with the lean, with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
