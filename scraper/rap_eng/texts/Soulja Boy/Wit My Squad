Young Soulja Boy, I keep the money and the strap
Kick up in yo' crip, bitch I'm looking for where you at
Heard he got them pounds and the bricks, bitch where they at
Riding through the hood and you know that I'm the man
Hundred bricks in, I can do this shit like Tony
Nigga disrespect, man these niggas so phony
I'm riding through the hood and I got that choppa' on me
AK47 leave a pussy by his lonely
Disrespect my team then you know I'm sending shots
Come in through that Veneno and then I drop the top
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em man I do this shit a lot
Wake up in the morning and then you know I whip the pot
Water whippin yolo, breaking bricks down to crumbs
Nigga where you from, nigga I'm from zone 1
Coming through the hood and you know I keep a gun
Shoot it out for fun, shoot all in yo' home
Run up in yo' crib, taking them bricks and then I'm gone
Call the plug up and I finesse him for his strong
Run off with his pack, now he say he say he gonna get me
Nigga catch me slipping, I'ma hit him with 'bout fifty
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em I tote a choppa' and a semi
Shoot it 'till it's empty, killers all in yo' chimney
PA, m2thaK them niggas riding with me
Damn it's a good day, my watch it cost 100K

[Hook]
Early in the morning, I'm on the phone trapping
10 million dollars, I got it off of rapping
Coming through the hood and you know I'm ready for that action
The bitches tryna to set me up, you know I can't trust 'em
I'm riding wit my squad, niggas try us and we busting
I'm riding wit my squad, niggas try us and we busting
I'm riding wit my squad, niggas try us and we busting
I'm riding wit my squad, niggas try us and we busting
