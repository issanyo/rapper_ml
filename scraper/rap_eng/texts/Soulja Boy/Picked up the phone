One thing on my mind please give me another chance

I remember just like yesterday the last thing you said
I wake up in the morning hearing voices in my head
But everyday I think what can a dude like me do ?
You said you loving me and I said I love you too
Scratching on my back and shawty said she love my sex

And we going in for hours every time she in my bed
The girl dripping wet all the way down her leg

Your girlfriends hating on you and the way that you ride
Do you remember when we used to talk all night ?
That you asking , Will you be my girl ?
But we from two different planets , we come from two different worlds
The very first time that I saw your face

Maybe I can be ya man , you could be my bestfriend
Baby I can be ya man until the very end
