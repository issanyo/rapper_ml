[Intro]
Skrt.. skrt... Soulja! Yeah.Soulja..Soulja Stacks on Deck! Money Gang!

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'

[Verse 1]
Walk in I step in the VIP
Young nigga drip, I got that thang on my hip
Young nigga empty the clip
Stay with a bad bitch you know she gon' strip
Walkin' around with a 50, I show you no pity
Young nigga I swerve through the city
I keep a draco and you know it's extended
I scrape the Ferrari, I push to the limit
Big backwood,(ugh!) big backwood got cookie in it
Ridin' two door, drop-top in the Continental
Slidin' in the Porsche and it got a lot of money it
Might cop the new Rari, might cop the new Bentley
Might VVS flood my neck and the whole city
Standin' in the trap tryna stack up a million
For M&M's I throw my wrist in the skillet

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'

[Verse 2]
Hundred K all on my necklace
Call on my cellular, I get a brick on the regular
The way that I flex on niggas it's irregular
Hop out the coupe, etc.. etc...
Gucci my shoes, Balmain on my jeans
I'm that young nigga, made Xan With That Lean
We take your bitch then we play tag-team
Walk in the mall with a 50, buy everything
Took your bitch, we out to Celine
I just be rockin' the Robin Jeans
I play with nine and the beam
I pull with in Bentley's, skrrt, I'm murkin' the scene
Pull with cash, me and the team
I'mma go VVS everything
She said that she feel like that she in a dream
I'm the young richest nigga she done seen
My money stand tall, Yao Ming
Pack touched down, I had to leave the scene
Run up on Soulja, get shot like a sling
Play with that money like nigga what you mean
A hundred K on me, nigga you know that's no thing
I play with the racks and the straps with a beam
Stay in the city serving pints of lean
Pull up straight drop, nigga that heat

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'
