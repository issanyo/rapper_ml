[Chorus:]
I’m whipping free base
And ghetto two chains
Pull up to the banks cause we buying aeroplanes
So meet me at the clear port
Ain’t go worth a billion dollars and we killing fort
We free base and ghetto two chains
Pull up to the banks cause we buying aeroplanes
So meet me at the clear port
Ain’t go worth a billion dollars and we killing fort

[Verse 1:]
I’m talking real talk
I ain’t never made head coach
I ain’t gonna make names
As long as money on the scale
I got them two chains
And all my niggas TRU
Young nigga shoe
I let them do what they do
I’m talking gang bang
Steel on that LA shit
Tryna get that LA park and get that LA brick
Thug life, mansion meetings, yacht parties
If you ain’t got a few million you ain’t no body
I’m talking cribs states
Club owner, landlords
Looking like your every shoulder he a drug lord
Thousand dollar shoes
Look she know this money walking
Listen to a OG
And this is money talking

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2]
It’s Soulja
Me and Calico in the Rover
SODMG the game and we taking over
I got power with this money
Got trace on my niggas
You ain’t gotta ask me you know that we deliver
Everywhere I go
I keep a lot of money, I got stacks on deck
A young nigga stay stunting
I call up my homie Mike
And hit the party jet
I went and put those cuban links on my fucking neck
[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Swish
