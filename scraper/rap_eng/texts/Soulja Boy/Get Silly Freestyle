[Verse]
I was splurgin' at North Park, tryna look rich (what?)
Could've bought an ass for my motherfuckin' bitch (damn)
Free Santana Sage (gang), he gonna empty out the clip (gang, gang)
On my momma, I'mma rage for my motherfuckin jits
I won't ever flip the page, bitch, I'm stickin' to the script (Rug-Rat!)
Old ass niggas lame and I'm bout to pull they slip (Rug-Rat!)
Bitch, I'm half your fuckin' age with a extra long clip (oh)
I don't got 10 shots, but yo' aim ain't shit (bitch)
Bitch I keep the Smith like my name Brad Pitt
22 shots, clip look like my dick (fa-fa-fa-fa)
If a nigga try me, on my momma I get lit (yuh)
If Wu say he dead, then I know his ass is hit
Choppa 22, with a extra long clip (bang)
And that stock kick back, but it ain't shit to fold that bitch (bap, bap)
Rappin' ass niggas ain't gon' do shit
Bitch I'm loadin' up this Cobra while you loadin' up that diss (gah, bah)
I got hella shooters, and they ain't gonna miss
Bitch it's 2016, what's the addy to your crib? (it's 2016, man)
I don't tote no Glock, boy, I know you see that stick (stick)
And if you run up on me like a Beyblade, I rip (fah)
I don't know what you heard, but Lil Tay-K with the shits
I never duck a opp, unless he is a snitch (snitch, bitch)
And I'm still out here juggin', 'cause I can't even resist (bitch)
And I still got opps, 'cause I'm still hittin' licks (bitch)
Bitch I'm Tay-K, and I'm steady on the clock (tick tock)
And the feds want my head [I grab a Glock and shoot a cop]
And I'm always finessin', I can never ever stop
If a nigga try to press me, like a soda I pop (pop)
If 12 pull me over, on my momma I'mma run
'Cause it's BB on my belt, but its hollows in my gun (hollows in my gun)
Every single day I could never miss one
Bitch I'm out here in the field, and I do this shit for fun
