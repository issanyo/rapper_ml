Oh that's your girl?
Well I ain't even know it
100k on my neck
You know I had to blow it
I pulled up, I hopped out, I walked in
I spent the guap
Then I bought a parking lot
See That's not your girl
She was with my brother
She was with my homie
And she was with my cousin
Damn I'm the man
I got bands
Let me tell you who I am

I'm so fresh, I'm so clean, I'm so fly

And you niggas really slow
And you must be on
Some shit that we ain't on
She say on the phone
Blowin'up my phone
In front of my home
Girl won't leave me alone
I said girl won't leave me alone
See that girl is not your girl right there
You see that girl is not loyal right there
Cuz I've seen her with my patnas
She low down dirty skeezer
