[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Get m outta here, shout out to my engineer Rick
He goin so ham, so hard, it's like a motherfuckin slam
Pretty boy, make these girls go bam
Fam, 8 girls on my motherfuckin dick
I'm so hot, bitch, in the sky, bitch
Higher than a motherfuckin alian, Soulja Boy so high, eyes lookin like a motherfuckin Asian
SOB boys, we in the gymnasiam
We goin ham, you goin cram
Weed all up in my cranium, smokin on that mania
SOB insane, man
Gohan like I'm Sayin, bitch
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin, bitch
I'm the hottest, bitch, SOB be on that block
With that Glocc, and it's cocked
I'm so hot, bitch, comin up out the pot, bitch
SOD won't stop, bitch
Can't nobody top this
Benzo goin ham on my motherfuckin wrist
SOD boys, yello diamonds like I pissed

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
What the fuck you talkin bout, tell that boy to walk it out
AK sip and surv, hit you with that Glocc if you don't get out
Goddamb, I'm goin ham again
Goddamb, goddamb
I walk and fly, I walk and fly
Gucci wings, Gucci wings
That boy can fly, that boy can fly
Gucci wings, Gucci wings

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Bassed god, I'm on a plane
I'm on the dash, on my game
Bitch, it's pretty boy, and I take your girl
Girl, my swag on, now I'm in her world
I'm in her world, I'm in her world
But I ain't bang her twice, girl, welcome to my world
Gotta view me, at the bar side
Iceskate with the diamonds, look like crushed ice
I'm balling, Ronald Iss
Used to be a goon, now I'm a pretty bitch
Pretty bitch, pretty bitch
No homo, got girls that wanna suck my dick
Suck my dick, suck my dick
ATL, I'm down south with my other chick
My other chick, my other chick
So many bitches on my dick, I'm goin out again

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
What the fuck you talkin bout, tell that boy to walk it out
AK sip and surv, hit you with that Glocc if you don't get out
Goddamb, I'm goin ham again
Goddamb, goddamb
I walk and fly, I walk and fly
Gucci wings, Gucci wings
That boy can fly, that boy can fly
Gucci wings, Gucci wings
