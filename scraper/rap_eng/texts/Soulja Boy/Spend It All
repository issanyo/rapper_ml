[Hook: Soulja Boy]
You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Had to cop a Phantom, had to hop out, damn I won a Grammy
Had to spend 3 million on my mansion
Had to buy my bitch Versace panties
I had the red bottoms they could not handle
I switched to Puma, I called my jeweler
Slick Rick the ruler, choppers like a ruler
Money on my deck, money on my neck
Ferragamo Fendi chain

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Just look at my diamonds
Hop inside my Phantom, seats reclining
I just made a hundred, I can't find em
Lil Soulja my name, you know I'm shinin'
And you know I do it, turn up Monday to Tuesday
Look at chains and ruby's
Nothing but 100's on me, you know how I do it
Kick it like karate, whip it like Wasabi
Money on my chain, they think I'm Illuminati
But you call me Soulja, I copped a Phantom
I don't ride the Rover, I just thought I'd told ya
My face on the poster, I see when I fold just
I put you over, in a coma
Sipping lean, they want it
I'm hot like a sauna, she wanted my number
Gave her the wrong number, I'm hot every summer
Put your ho to slumber, these niggas is one hit wonders, a hunnid mil

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
