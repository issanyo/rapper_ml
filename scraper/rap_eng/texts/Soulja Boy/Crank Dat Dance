[Hook x8]
Hey crank that dance
Watch me crank my dance (Watch me do)

[Verse 1]
I fall up in the club crank my dance on that ho
I'm scoping out the scene then I hit the dance floor
You already know what it is what it been to be
Soulja Boy ain't got no money? Hell no, you must be shitting me
But hit me on the net so I can show you where I'm from
Type it in, Soulja Boy Tell'Em dot com
But back to the topic on doing my dance on that ho
I can crank my two-step then I do the merry-go

[Hook x8]
Hey crank that dance
Watch me crank my dance (Watch me do)

[Verse 2: J-bar]
I'm in the club wylin'
Now watch me jet that shit
And now she love smiling
Because she been that shit
And if she keep trying
But you can't get that shit
He mad I can't do it like him I been did that shit
Go well, I'm murkin' the scene
Watch me roll and watch me lean
All the hoes be jocking me
Cause all the clothes I'm rocking clean
All I smoke is lots of green
[TC?] rock, the [?]
You ain't seen me crank the club
Now gonna watch me crank my dance

[Hook x8]
Hey crank that dance
Watch me crank my dance (Watch me do)

[Bridge x2]
I fall up in the club and I'm in my mack stance
And everybody screaming Soulja Boy do your dance
Do your dance
Do your dance
Do your dance

[Hook x16]
Hey crank that dance
Watch me crank my dance (Watch me do)

[Outro]
