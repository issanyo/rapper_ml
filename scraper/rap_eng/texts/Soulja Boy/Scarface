Big ass house like Scarface
Whole lotta guns like Scarface
Got a white bitch like Scarface
Got a lotta whips call me Scarface
I’m deep in the game like a OG
Sippin’ dirty Sprite out the OZ
Walkin’ thru the hood with my weapon
I’m swagged up with a Smith-and-Wessun

I done came off the boat like Scarface
Whole lotta dope like Scarface
Gold ring rope like Scarface
Make this bitch like Scarface
I’m Scarface
I’m Scarface
Living in a movie
A whole lotta boobs in the jacuzzi
A whole lotta clips in the uzi
I swear to God I’m ’bout to do me

Big ass crib like Scarface
Fours on my whip like Scarface
Killed him and took his bitch like Scarface
Pistol up on my hip like Scarface
I’m Scarface

Driving in Miami
Bad white bitch in the passenger, Tammy
I deserve a Grammy
Iced out the mansion
Lil Dre, AKA, Tony Montana
