Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
I mix that purp with them beans nigga
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green (sushi)
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
I mix that purp with them bins nigga

My nigga young low did a lot of stag
That louis brief case that's a lot of money
I hit the block with a ton of chronic
You see my closet, that's a ton of money
These niggas talking but don't know the words
What around my niggas steady of flipping work
Fuck what you heard, I grind hard
So every time you see me bitch I shine hard
Rolex, that's fifteen
Whole block, about ten beans
Infrared on the silencer
Disrespect young low I might silencer
It's Soulja Boy I'm from that ocean
Gold on deck wiping Bentley slow motion
Middle finger to the fucking sky
I'm getting money, counting bread while I'm stupid high

Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green (sushi)
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga (sushi)
I mix that purp with them beans nigga
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga

I walk inside my office everybody work
Five thousand beans, two pounds of purp
Time to hit the pussy nigga, the where it hurt
If you standing on this earth bitch go to work (sushi)
In my turf we get in there first
Pull up, top off, her pussy get moist
She in love with the street nigga
And we in love with that beef nigga
Fuck, what you heard is fifty nigga
Thirteen fuck around and rip you nigga
My young nigga's getting in quicker
Gold on deck, Louis interior
Bitch I'm hungry I'm a take the pipe
Bitch I'm hungry I'm a break the block
Fuck what you heard bitch we going up
Niggas see my new chain start throwing up
Fudgy allow oozies when we rolling up
Promethazine nigga what we pouring up
Nothing but shooters when we showing up
Nothing but ocean gang throwed up
Fuck what you heard he's a little nigga
Fuck what you heard he's a little nigga

Fifty, thirteen, bin
Purp with them beans
