Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: 24hrs & Soulja Boy]
Yeah, Soulja
24hrs, we in 88 world
Draco

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I love your smile, I love your eyes
I love that thing that I lick that's between your thighs
I want your time, like all the time
I would do whatever just to make you mine
Be my Valentine
Will you be my Valentine?
You better be my Valentine
I wanna be your Valentine, ah

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You get flowers, you get chocolate
All this Ace of Spades, I’m like a alcoholic
VVS on your dress
Actin' like you know me, movin' so [?]
Will you be my Valentine?
At your crib, we did no romantic shit
If I ask you to be mine, better not act all hesitant, yeah
We won’t get no charges, 'cause you bad as Kelly Rowland

[Chorus: 24hrs & Soulja Boy]
I love your smile, I love your eyes
I love that thing that I lick that's between your thighs
I want your time, like all the time (Soulja, Soulja)
I would do whatever just to make you mine (Soulja)
Be my Valentine (Yeah)
Will you be my Valentine? ('Tine, Soulja)
You better be my Valentine (Girl)
I wanna be your Valentine, ah (Draco, 24, 24hrs)
