[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]

Gucci durag just check out my flag
Just walked in this bitch with a brand new bag
Pull up, Porsche, Check a flag
It ain't Halloween Im walking 'round with the mac

In the trap with the strap and that mac on my lap
Ménage à trois in my gucci durag
She a bad ass bitch with a fake ass
I pull up Porsche truck and drop off a bag

Pull up im serving that [?] and they know that shit
Look at my diamonds you ain't even notice it
Walk in the mall with 20 thou' nigga I blow that shit
You pass me that backwood it ain't no gas, imma throw that shit

Pull in the corvette and flex on you niggas
I'm Big Soulja Draco I dont fuck with you niggas
Bout 200 in the corvette had to get a ticket
Jumped out that bitch and i hopped in new Bentley

Pedal to the medal, Push it To the limit
In the trap I run circles round' niggas like fidget spinners
Condo came with versace slippers
SODMG records, nigga I bought the building

I just made another million (ooh)
I just serve and then i'm killin (Uhh)
In the trap in the kitchen throw fish in the skillet
V12 my engine just to be specific

Ridin' round' town with  a brick on me
You ain't gotta ask, lil nigga I got that stick on me
Run up on gang you history
Where you get all that money from damn it's a mystery

Sitting in the trap with that mac on my lap
Lil lame ass nigga, Know you ain't getting no racks
I'm ridin' round' with that strap
Young nigga post up with a brick in the trap

Just sold a brick the other day
Left wrist cost a hundred k (100k)
Run up on gang and imma let that choppa spray
Got a brick of actavis in my trophy case

I just cashed out on another Wraith
If you ain't getting no money get the fuck up out my face
Hit the cookie dope i;m Outerspace
Talkin shit nigga you know them bullets hit your face
