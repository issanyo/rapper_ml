[Chorus]
Now I put fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Ridin' through the city in that Rolls Royce
It's just how we roll
Cause we roll
I got fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Bad bitches [?]
So we gone, gone
Gone, gone

[Verse]
I got fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Sippin' on lean, it made me go slow
On the stage and I'm in beast mode
Hundreds in my bankroll
Ridin' through the city and we turnt up
Lean inside my double-cup
Pulled up in a Lambo
Hop out like Rambo
Lotta goons, lotta ammo
Lotta guns, lotta ammo

[Chorus]
Now I put fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Ridin' through the city in that Rolls Royce
It's just how we roll
Cause we roll
I got fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Bad bitches [?]
So we gone, gone
Gone, gone
Now I put fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Ridin' through the city in that Rolls Royce
It's just how we roll
Cause we roll
I got fifties and hundreds inside my bankroll
Bad bitches [?]
So we gone, gone
Gone, gone
