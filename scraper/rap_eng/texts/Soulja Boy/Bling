[Intro]
Everytime I buy new watch, Bling Bling
Everytime I pull up in the trap, Bling Bling
Everytime I pull up on the trap, Bling Bling
Just check the rollie on my wrist, Bling Bling
Got the patek bust down, Bling Bling
Got the brand new cuba link, Bling Bling
Diamonds on my neck and they real, Bling Bling
(Got the diamonds tested and they...)
Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling

[Hook]
Diamonds on my neck, Bling Bling
Rollie on my wrist, Bling Bling
Chains on my neck, Bling Bling
Wanna beef with Big Soulja's not a thing
Chain on my neck, Bling Bling
Rollie on my wrist, Bling Bling
Pinkie ring on me, Bling Bling
Wanna beef with Big Soulja's not a thing

[Verse]
Cuban link on my neck, Bling Bling
Robbed the plug for the lean, for the lean
Ridin' round town, smokin' dope in it a thing
Bitch I pull up in a sting, bitch you know I'm with the team
Chains on my neck, Columbine
I fell in love for Nissan
Smokin' on dope, bitch I do that all the time
If you get that last line, then you need to hit rewind
50K, my rollie make you blind
Run up on Big Soulja, shoot it's fire
Hit the fuck nigga with that arm, you a broke boy, you a bitch
And you know that I'm harm
Forgiatos on my tires when I swerve
Broke basic bick, had to kick it to the curve
Been on big Soulja nerve, hop in when I swerve
Drop the top of the Lambo, I'm off the curve
Smokin' on dope, I'm in my lane
I can't never ever be a lame
Fuck nigga, ain't no rain game
Run up on it then we blow as blames

[Hook]
Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling
Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling
(Everytime I come up the track, 30 in the seen on my lap)
Chains on my neck, Bling Bling
Rollie on my wrist, Bling Bling
Pinkie ring Gomie, Bling Bling
Wanna beef with Big Soulja's not a thing (Bling, Bling)
Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling
(Everytime I buy new watch,Bling Bling, Every time I pull up in the trap, Bling Bling)
Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling, Bling
(30 in the seen on my lap, Bling Bling, cooking up crack in the truck)

[Outro]
I know what's going on,(Bling Bling)
Draco, Ah (Pull up on the 30 in the stripe, Ah)
(Diamonds on my teeth, that's a miracle)
Bling, Bling
(Talkin' to yo bitch, draco, draco, draco, draco)
