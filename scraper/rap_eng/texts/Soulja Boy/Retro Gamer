I woke up today
Feeling real fresh
Hopped out the [?] 8
Hit me the best tune, rep stacsk on deck
We ain't got [?] cash to make
I got a lot of swag to make
I got a lot of people to please
Sod still on those streets, still rest on me
Everybody still know that yellow piece, yes
Polo is the best
.players live once know their stress
Know they're stressed about the [?]
Ain't none but to get it
Ain; t none but to do it
I'm still so HD, swag to the max
Still got a hundred tats
Still got some people dressed in black
Ready to move, still got some people doing what they do
Yeah I do this shit
You know I got to stay fly
We move this shit
Everything is retro shit
Everything is retro shit


No pen no pad
I'm so smooth I got that swag
Bitch hit me on my phone
I was at home, on my motherfucking throne
King shit bitch
Smoking on kush yeah I like that shit
All that swag they like that shit
Like this shit on radio games, like nights and shit
I told the bitch I had a [?]
She ain't know what that was
These shoes that I got on, what that was
So fresh as fuck, hopped out that bus

Yeah I do this shit
You know I got to stay fly
Everything is retro shit
