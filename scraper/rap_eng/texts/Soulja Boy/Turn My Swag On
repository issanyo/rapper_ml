(Chorus)
Hopped up out the bed turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said wassup
(yeah)

(oh)
Hopped up out the bed turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said wassup
( yeah)

(oh)

They told me 'round my hood
(what they say)
Errytime they see me I look good
(yeah, why)
I'm gettin money
(yeah)
If you be hatin' just be mad at yo'self
I bet you think this song is about you
(do not you)
Do not you

But I did it without you
(yeah)

Got M's up to them hatas' cause we too busy winnin'

Cuz I'm getting paper like you would not believe
And I'll gettin 'it like you would not believe


Boy stop

Swag is not somethin 'you can wear on yo' neck
You can buy you a chain but you can not buy respect
I'mma walk it like I talk it so you never forget
And if you get your swag on

If you wake up in the morning and you turn yo swag on
Lemme hear ya say (yeah)

Hopped up the bed, turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said wassup
(yeeea)
I'm gettin 'money
