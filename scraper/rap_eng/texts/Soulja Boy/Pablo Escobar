[Bridge]
When you getting all this money
These niggas they look at you funny
These niggas thirsty bitches hungry
All I wanna be is Pablo

[Verse]
Wait I just got back, automatic strap hold up
Whole lotta bitches in the vip, Ak47 make em flip
Whole lotta money in the vip, Ridin wit the thang on my hip
I know these niggas they want me to slip, Ice in my ear so clear
Cuban link all on my neck, Ridin round town on a jet
Flex and Finesse gold on my rolex, Stacking up all this cake
No Flex, No flex zone getting caught, I can fuck his baby momma
Ridin round town got money, Young Soulja Boy make it rain make it thunder
Money coming in and I feel like Pablo, Cheese coming like it is nacho
All these bitches on me, All I want is the guap tho and all my niggas on top
Be sitting in the Pent House that be the top floor
Smoking on Kush y'all niggas say you getting money but we know you not tho

[Verse 2]
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, They say I wouldn't make it

I know that they mad that I made it, I know that they hate it
I look at they look at they faces, We switching the money by cases
I do not need no favors, Soulja boy stunt on them haters
Stunt on them Stunt on them haters, My car different flavors
My crib got a elevator, Ride it up like a escalator, Money I penetrate
Niggas they hating they fake, They tryna stop my money but I know they can't
I'm laughing all the way to the bank, Bitches is hitting my phone, They wanna come chill with a throne, Young Soulja Boy I be on, Flexing and going they blowing my phone
