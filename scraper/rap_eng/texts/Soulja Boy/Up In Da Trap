[Hook]
I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
Money in the front, pistols in the back
Bentley and the Lambo, I paint it black
Step off in my kitchen with 100 racks

I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
I'ma spend some racks, I'ma make it back
Disrespect the game, turn you to a pack
Disrespect the game, shoot you in yo back

[Verse 1]
I been trapping hard, I pull yo card
Yeah we pouring lean, pull up in yo yard
And I'm SOD and I'm full of bars
Fucking with my gang, leave you when you young
I finnese the plug, I got all the plugs
Tryna snatch my chain, you get hit with slugs
Word around town, Soulja 100 million
And I got them pounds and I bag the seal

[Hook]
I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
Money in the front, pistols in the back
Bentley and the Lambo, I paint it black
Step off in my kitchen with 100 racks

I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
I'ma spend some racks, I'ma make it back
Disrespect the game, turn you to a pack
Disrespect the game, shoot you in yo back

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm [?] what's happening with
30 on me, 30's everywhere
Hang you from a roof like a chandelier
Turn you to a pack, [?]
If you ain't got my money, bitch I'll take you there
Word around town, Soulja AR 100 rounds
Shoot 2-2-3's
Bad bitch believe
And I'm overseas, 50k my wrist on freeze
I just got a Rolex and new AP
I'm up in the trap, water whippin' keys
Word around town, Soulja love syrup
Bitch I'm in the trap, I'm in love with flipping birds

[Hook]
I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
Money in the front, pistols in the back
Bentley and the Lambo, I paint it black
Step off in my kitchen with 100 racks

I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
I'ma spend some racks, I'ma make it back
Disrespect the game, turn you to a pack
Disrespect the game, shoot you in yo back

[Verse 3]
Brand new Guiseppe, [?]
Money coming in and know I turn
Look at the table, look at the rim
Look at the [?]
[?]
Fuck her brain, check cash
100 thousand when I smash
[?]
I got this money on me
Frank Lucas on me
Scarface, Tony eat
Tony Montana with heat
Come to your block and I'm toting the heat
Shout out to my niggas, they street
All of my niggas, they heat
Some of my niggas shoot
Shout out my niggas salute
30 thousand in the Maserati coup [?]

[Hook]
I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
Money in the front, pistols in the back
Bentley and the Lambo, I paint it black
Step off in my kitchen with 100 racks

I'm up in the trap, I'm up in the trap
I'ma spend some racks, I'ma make it back
Disrespect the game, turn you to a pack
Disrespect the game, shoot you in yo back
