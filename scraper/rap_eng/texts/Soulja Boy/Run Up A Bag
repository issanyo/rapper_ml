[Chorus]
Had to go get me a check
Had to go run up a bag
Had to go ice out my neck
Had to go ice out my wrist
Damn these niggas so mad
She was suckin' on dick
I guess that the bitch, she wanted a bag
I was whippin' my wrist
Just had ran up a whole lot of cash
Hermes link
Lean, same color Easter egg
Don't run up and play with gang
We gone put one in yo dread
I'ma skrrt the Maserati like Santa on a sled
You ain't even know bout Draco, man my favorite color red

[Verse 1]
Red bitch, red dot, red Rari, red Lamb
When I walk inside the bank, they be like "god damn"
In Burberry goin' in
Jacket hit me for three bands
In my Porsche bout to fall asleep, leaning like kickstand
Throwing cash out the coupe
Play with gang and we shoot
I got birds like the zoo
I am blessed like "atchoo"
I got Fendi on my shoe
12 in the rearview
Nah, I ain't gone pull it over
I'ma skrrt-skrrt-zoom

[Chorus]
Had to go get me a check
Had to go run up a bag
Had to go ice out my neck
Had to go ice out my wrist
Damn these niggas so mad
She was suckin' on dick
I guess that the bitch, she wanted a bag
I was whippin' my wrist
Just had ran up a whole lot of cash
Hermes link
Lean, same color Easter egg
Don't run up and play with gang
We gone put one in yo dread
I'ma skrrt the Maserati like Santa on a sled
You ain't even know bout Draco, man my favorite color red

[Verse 2]
Uzi get to poppin, just like all up in yo pimple
Wearing official designer drip, I'm a Ferragamo stepper
I'm too player for you haters, I caught capers in Las Vegas
She want Hennessy, I got lean on me, I'll see you later
Everyday I count up crazy
Penthouse, skyscraper
Rollie wrist, new Mercedes
New Givenchy for my lady
Beats By Dre, Bluetooth crazy
Lamborghini Huracan crazy
Whip the pot like a baby
VVS diamonds look so crazy

[Chorus]
Had to go get me a check
Had to go run up a bag
Had to go ice out my neck
Had to go ice out my wrist
Damn these niggas so mad
She was suckin' on dick
I guess that the bitch, she wanted a bag
I was whippin' my wrist
Just had ran up a whole lot of cash
Hermes link
Lean, same color Easter egg
Don't run up and play with gang
We gone put one in yo dread
I'ma skrrt the Maserati like Santa on a sled
You ain't even know bout Draco, man my favorite color red
