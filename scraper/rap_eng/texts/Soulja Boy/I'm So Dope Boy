[Hook x24]
I'm so dope, boy

[Verse 1]
When I step up out the car I'm so dope boy
On the twenty threes spread that's for show boy
I'm getting money
Yeah, I'm getting paid
Step up on the scene with the fresh Cartier
Getting money, that's just what you thought
I walk through the school and made all the girls hoes
Soulja gon make it big
Yeah I done told you, done told you
Come see me man, fresh
I'm so dope, boy

[Hook x14]
I'm so dope, boy

[Verse 2]
You can catch me at a party you know that it's me
With some fresh white shades and a fresh white T
With some conarite coated diamonds falling off of my chain
Looking so dope, boy, while they screaming my name
I'm the one who your girl, man, love to hate
Cause I'm so fresh how I dress with the Bathing Apes
I'm so dope, boy, and you already know
I see a lot of folk hating, start hating some more

[Hook x24]
I'm so dope, boy

[Bridge x2]
Soulja Boy you fresh mane you clean you on the block again
Heard about them haters they say they real but they ain't stopping it
Nope, I'm so dope, I'm so dope
I'm so dope, I'm so dope
I'm so dope, I'm so dope
I'm so dope, I'm so dope

[Hook x24]
I'm so dope, boy
