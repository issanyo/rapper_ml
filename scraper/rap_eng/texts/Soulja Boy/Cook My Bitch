[Intro: Lil B]
Goddamn, BasedGod, oh my God (Soulja Boy: Drank!)
You can take my keys, you can drive my bitch
Goddamn, BasedGod, we going in this mothafucka (Soulja Boy: Swag!)
Goddamn, Soulja, oh my God
You got bitches, goddamn
All these bitches, oh my God

[Verse 1: Lil B]
You can drive my bitch (Swag), you can drive my Lexus
Drive that ho to Mexico to prove the bitch I’m reckless
Young BasedGod (Swag) drive the ho out of sissies (Soulja)
Bitch, I’m out the frame, and I ain’t talking about them lenses
You looking so racist, different allocations
Different on they places, different with they numbers
Young BasedGod ride a bitch for the summer
Young BasedGod ride that ho on the dungeon

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
[During last line of Hook] I'm in the kitchen
Look at my plate (Dre), whipping up the pasta (Pasta)
Young S-O-D (D), mothafucking monstas (Damn)
Now cook that bitch (Now cook that bitch), ain’t got no keys (ain’t got no keys)
Suicide my whip (suicide my whip), and I wreck her eat (make her eat)
Yelling “Diamond Beezy” (Eat), cooking like a chef (Eat)
Iron Chef Beezy (Beezy), twenty Hamburger Helpers (twenty Hamburger Helpers)
Bitch I’m going ham (Swag), and I’m going turkey (Drank)
Bitches at my door (OK), so I’m straight swerving (Swag)
Drive, drive, (Scerrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!) drive, twenty miles
Drive, drive, (Errrrrrrr!) drive, forty thousand (*imitating police sirens*)
Swag, Swag, you know I’m popping tags (Drank) (Rain)
P.B.M., swag on deck (Pretty Boy Millionaires), and we all up [?] (BasedGod)
