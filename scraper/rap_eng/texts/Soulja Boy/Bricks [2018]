[Chorus]
Walked out the strip, got that thang on my hip
Pussy nigga better not play with gang, do not slip
Yeah, hop up on that yacht and I go take a trip
Came back with them pounds, came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks

[Verse: Trill Sammy & Soulja Boy]
Young Drako nigga I play with the pans
Poppin' the seals and mixin' the xans
Stacks On Deck Money Gang, we in demand
Go ask your bitch, she know I'm the man
Go cop a zip, yeah that's soon as I land
Pour up a six, double cup in my hand
Hit your bitch from the back just to get up the count
Bankroll on me way bigger
Two bitches with me but I'm in the middle
My type of bitch she like backwoods, not swishers
Hop out a Range and keep range from you niggas (skrrt)
Posted with a whole lot of money, young nigga up to somethin'
Model lil bitch, I'm in out in London
Then I go pick up 15, throw it all at Onyx
Run up them bands, where my cake?
She wanna fuck but I made the bitch wait
Tried to send him a P, but it's really all shake
Ran up 50s to 100s, I throw 'em the safes
Cartier wrist with the ice
Might catch a flight but I can't stay the night
Shawty my type so I might change her life
[?] like he Juice
VVS on every tooth
She wanna fuck but her pussy too loose
I rather go count some blue

[Chorus]
Walked out the strip, got that thang on my hip
Pussy nigga better not play with gang, do not slip
Yeah, hop up on that yacht and I go take a trip
Came back with them pounds, came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy & Trill Sammy]
Jumped out the coupe, then I walked inside the trap (aye)
Posted with my niggas, I got automatic straps (uh)
You know that the gang put shit on the map
Fuck with gang, nigga you know you gettin' clapped
You not my homie, nigga you don't get dapped
Ridin' round town with that strap in my lap
Serving Hi-Tech, lean, act'
Juugin, finessin, when I hop on the track
I got your bitch, come get your bitch back
Run up on gang, the bullets gon spray yo ass flat
Yeah, back of the Maybach
Shawty wanna fuck me then say that
Send a couple shots at your du-rag
[?] cause they filled up with blue racks

[Chorus]
Walked out the strip, got that thang on my hip
Pussy nigga better not play with gang, do not slip
Yeah, hop up on that yacht and I go take a trip
Came back with them pounds, came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks
Came back with them bricks
