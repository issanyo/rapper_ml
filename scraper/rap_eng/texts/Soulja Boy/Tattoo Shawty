[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tatted from my neck and (Flocka!)
Flocka like to show his (Yuh!)
Arms, shirt off just to show off my artwork
She say she in love, Flocka like to flirt
You get no love if you ain't got artwork
Her boyfriend cool (lame), Waka Flocka Flame
Tattoos and war wounds, he naked so we not the same
Flocka got more ink than a marker
Too many tattoos, call me Travis Barker

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
