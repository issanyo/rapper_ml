[Hook - Soulja Boy]
I'm driving in a foreign
All the ride this foreign
All the ride this foreign
I'm driving in a foreign
Yeah my car is foreign
Yeah my car is foreign
I'm driving in a foreign
I'm riding in a foreign

[Verse 1 - Soulja Boy]
I bought your car walk in the club
I got the party poppin'
My… ask me why I go so hard it ain't no stoppin’
I need everything foreign I need a lot of money pouring
We never see the el tore ‘cause Soulja Boy got a fortune
We’re not playing, every car is foreign with 'em driving
Drifting left to right and everything snowing
I need every chain all my neck golden
I need every diamond in my ear frozen
Take off, take off, 3 2 1 let's race off
And my jet is about to take off
Take off, take off, 3 2 1 let's race off
And my jet is about to take off

I need everything foreign
Yeah I'm riding foreign
Driving around in foreign
A lot of money is foreign
I need foreign, I need a foreign

Every car is foreign
Every girl is gorgeous
Money yeah it's pouring
The cities yeah I'm touring
I need everything foreign, foreign
I need everywhere foreign, foreign

[Verse 2 - Soulja Boy]
You walk in the club bad boy
And I ain't looking everyone
Ain't nobody drive my style
I'm in the club I'm stupid high
I'm blowing kushie to the sky
Pour up, pour up
I'm a jury froze up
They see my car like hold up
See my car like slow up
It's nothing, yeah I'm stuntin'
We gettin' money we don't do no frontin'
We all in or nothing
No talking, no drop your style so you walking
You rent this shit but I bought it
It's Soulja telling me no Audi
I pull up in this foreign
Overseas when I'm touring
It's foreign
