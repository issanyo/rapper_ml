[Chorus] [x2]
Fell in love with the swag [x4]
The Prada, the Loui, the Fendi
Got this nigga is offended
Fell in love getting cash
All the money go get it
Fell in love with the swag [x3]
She fell in love with the swag
The money [x3]
Diamonds  cooler than a cooler
Fell in so many chains
Bitches think I’m the jeweller
Whip it whip it on my wrist
Unable to transcribe, line not clear
I just made a nigga sick
Pull up with his fucking bitch
Unable to transcribe, line not clear
I got red bottom on my kicks
Swags on, ain’t know me
She fell in love with my rich
Diamonds dripping on my bitch
I just find me a brick
I just cop me a whip
I just got me some clips
Me and Calico Jones
Pull up we on
Your bitch in love with my swag
Blowing up my phone

[Verse 1:]
Pull up in a Rari
Unable to transcribe, line not clear
All my brand new versace
Started in the kitchen
Whipping , flipping shits
I’m working like Twister Herbashine
Got a quarter million dollar worth of watches
So much swag got the whole hood watching
She bad and her friend in silence
I beat the pussy up like Boston
Rolie on my wrist that’s a pandemery
Michael Jackson on these hoes in the mirror
All the beats in my chunk call it godzilla
Me and Soulja bought twenty pairs of moschella
Louis Vuitton got them tripping
Two thousand for shoes
And my bottles keep dripping
And I’m fly on the plane
Hot in red bottoms next on the plane

[Chorus] [x2]
