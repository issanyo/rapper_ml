[Intro]
Soulja, Soulja
Ohh, on a bean, with the lean
And I got to drink
You know I do my thing, money gang

[Hook:]
On a bean picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking, I put her on bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Bitch I do my thing, bitch I do my thing
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking, I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Molly with that lean, bitch I do my thing

[Verse 1]
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Man I do my thing, thing boy I stay clean
Boy you know Im packing, y'all boys playing
Pull up in that Porsche, like what you really saying
Do this everyday, do this all the time
Man I'm on my hustle, man I'm on my grind
In a big time, say I'm in a big leash
I'm out on the stage, and you in the VIP
Man I'm in the streets, man 'Im in your fucking girl
Take her to the crib, molly world
With that lean, with that smoke
Im on the yacht, Im on a boat

[Hook:]
On a bean picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking, I put her on bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Bitch I do my thing, bitch I do my thing
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking, I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Molly with that lean, bitch I do my thing
Molly with that lean, lean
Molly with that lean
With that lean, with that lean
Molly with that lean, Molly with that lean

[Verse 2]
On a bean, struggling out the club
Stumbling looking for my keys
Hopped inside the Porsche swerving oh I'm on freeze
Rolex on my wrist, hold it up if you paid
It's Rolex gang
That's what I claim, I pull up 20 racks in my pocket
My pocket, water running with the lean like a faucet
I'm getting money, and you niggas can't stop it, you can't stop it
Say I'm a king, I'm a king
All the girls in the club say I'm clean, say I'm clean
I wake up in the morning do my thing, do my thing
And your girlfriend right here she on a bean, she on a bean
She on a bean, molly with the lean , with the lean
Molly with the lean, with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
