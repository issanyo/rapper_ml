[Chorus]
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold rings on my fingers you can't tell?
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold chains 'round my neck you can't tell?
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel

[Verse 1]
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold rings on my fingers you can't tell?
I walk inside the mall and buying it by the bags
Hit my cellphone private messages going hell
Im in love with bow mane
Overseas in paris man i gotta ball mane
55 thousand dollars sitting on my tac
If it ain't a G bitch i gotta send it back
Riding through the hood in a armored car flat
Hieroglyphic jewellery and it looking like artifact
Im in love with Chanel
All my fucking jewelry shining hard you can't tell?
Sitting getting bars like you sitting in a cell
Flipping different cars like oh my god on the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Shawty wanna turner she know that im popping
In the V I P Chanel what im rocking
Gucci wearbottoms in the back for a auction
22 racks when my pockets on sloppy
Pizza with the toppin' Soulja Boy quapin'
Lamborghini pedal to the metal no stoppin'
Im in love with coco
Riding through the hood and im watching for popo
Catch me in the hood with the dark black 44
Nigga talk down put his body to the flo
Shout out to MK mane thats my roro
Riding through the hood and you already know

[Chorus]
