Verse 1
EA$Y TAVEN
I'm the only one
That's makes hits
All day
On my grind
Trying to make beats
Always close my ears
I don't take myths
When you grew up
With Nothing
You don't take treats
Everytime
I get that money
It's always Christmas
On my hands
And my feet
You see this blisters
Momma works
So hard for us
To grant our wishes
Yeah Yeah

Verse 2
I mix gold with the leather
I will die for my brother
Take a bullet
For my sister
Family always been first
Man I passed all my tests
And they still tasting me
Been doing this for years
Not for any money
We had to sit in the sun
We had to be
Our own sheds
Yeah Yeah

Looking jealous
And crazy
They know
I'm ready
Pull up Mercedes

Verse 3
I got shades
They can't shade me
Already cut
They can't cut me
And that Boi
Tito still my homie
I hit life with both hands
Call that Volley
But I'll be dreaming forever
On the phone
With my saviour
I hit the plug
With no cable
Cause I don't want
No troubles
Cause I don't want no troubles
Would they be down to ride
Nooo
The popo still killing my people oh
Will I ever stop
I don't think so
Yeahhh
Yourrr
