[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
When I hit the block, I just sell that dope
When I hit the trap, I just smoke the dope
'Lot of packs came in, already gone
Riding in that Rari, skrrrt I’m gone
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Pull up in a Maserati (yeah)
All these girls on my body
Picture flash, paparazzi (yeah)
Social media, I'm the trending topic
Five thousand on some newly bought
Riding through the city and you know we fly
'Lot of bands on me, you know how I rock
Bands out the door, bands out the door

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
When I hit the block, I just sell that dope
When I hit the trap, I just smoke the dope
’Lot of packs came in, already gone
Riding in that Rari, skrrrt I'm gone
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When I hit the block, I just sell that dope
When I hit the trap, I just smoke the dope
'Lot of packs came in, already gone
Riding in that Rari, skrrrt I'm gone
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Just got back to Cali, I already poured a pint
Two bricks, shawty call me Mike & Ike
Told a pretty bitch I'll book her flight
That 45 cool, but the FN bright
Two rings on, man that's somethin' slight
I was in the county, folks sendin' kite (foenem)
I see [?], she wanna be my wife
Y’all ain’t on the green like white on rice
Grratt, grratt, grratt, grratt, grratt, gratt
I'm countin’ up all this dac, it's a gold MAC
Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt
Where the check at? Where the racks at?
Eh, eh, eh, hoe get back
I need new coochie, I already hit that
Hella different brands, that's mismatch (designer)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, I ain't get that

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
When I hit the block, I just sell that dope
When I hit the trap, I smoke the dope
’Lot of packs came in, already gone
Riding in that Rari, skrrrt I'm gone
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
