[Verse 1]
Versace Versace Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
I'm gon' need 100 more bottles a rich nigga stepped in the party
Givenchy Givenchy Givenchy all black and I look like I'm Kanye
Stepping out the Murcielago the hoes they keep calling me Andre'
I'm smoking on loud, and I'm sipping on lean, and I'm bout to take flight
Bad bitch she ridin' with me and she having the time of her life
I walk in the store with 100 racks on me like boy what it do
I'm ridin' round town and smokin' on loud and my car got no roof
Size 32, I copped 'em in blue, Versace my shoe
Medusa my chain, it look so insane, I need everything new
I walk in the club they cut on this song that shit look like a zoo
I rock the Versace shirt once, and they Monkey-see Monkey-Doo
And when I come step on the scene, soulja boy fresher than you
Step through the door in Versace, me and all of my crew
I copped in red and in green, and then I went and copped it in blue
And Drake killed the Versace beat and Soulja boy came killed it too
I'm Gone
