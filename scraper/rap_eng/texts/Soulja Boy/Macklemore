[Hook]
I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
Got a lot of money, it's coming through the door
I got a hundred bands on the floor
I got Louie V, and I got Michael Kors
I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
I got a hundred bands, coming straight through the door
I got money all across the floor
I got versace trench coats and I got Michael Kors

[Verse 1]
I be riding in that foreign whip
Hop up in the whip, I'm walking in the whip
Thirty bands and that's on my hip
I keep a couple bad bitches, I make them strip
I'm getting bands like I'm Barack Obama
I did had the game locked for like six summers
I got a dirty gun in that hummer, and your girl want me to ask for her number

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We make it rain when we hit the club
My rims so big, it make my tires scrub
I got a Bentley, I park it in my house
I got a big whip, hanging all out
I do 360, then I'm ???
I got my gang on now, we going fucking ham
I got a fucking bad bitch, we got a lot money
I got a lot of fuck niggas, they be hating on me

[Hook]
