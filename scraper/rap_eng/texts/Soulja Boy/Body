[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Scream, scream
Swamp Izzo
Juice Mixtape, bitch

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy
I got girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty got a body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
True Religion, pockets sloppy
Shawty got a body
She gon' drop it low
Soon as we step inside a party
Girls all on my body
Tats all on my body
Soulja got the juice
We VIP and bottle poppin'
Shawty keep on dancin'
I'mma pour juice on yo body
My lil' yellow bone freak
Yeah, she do it like nobody
[?] like I ride it
Standin' in the club
Throwin' cash, we got that money

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy
I got girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty got a body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy

[Verse 2: Calico Jonez]
Bitch, I got the juice
Shells ain't for my shoes
Girls all on my body
Lickin' my tattoos (yes)
With my Tootsie, bitch
But I know it's private
She with that freaky shit (money)
She chewed me on the highway
She work it [?]
And she just want 21
Homies down the lobby
LBC side, 21
She know she my side chick, she know that I'm hood rich
She know I'm from Memphis (Memphis)
Gangsta, I'm with the shit

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy
I got girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Girls all on my body
Shawty got a body
Shawty is a hottie
And I'm ridin' Maserati
True Religion, pockets sloppy
I'm official, not a copy
