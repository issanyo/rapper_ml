You know I went and bought me two Bentleys bitch
Bust down roll a scent
Ima hop out the Maserati lookin like the president
Me and Bow Wow, we stupid rich
Every time you see me got a new bitch
Choppa clip look like a pool stick
Rich niggas stay on that ignorant shit
Scrape the pot with the four
Whip the cocaine just like an egg yolk
Put the rap game in a finger fold
Pull up on your block, spray with the Draco
Still on your block with a new AK
Hit the pot with my elbow like Johnny Cage
Ridin around town in the brand new Wraith
Smokin gelato, I'm higher than space!

All a nigga smoke is bong
Bought a store for my moms
All this money in my palms

In Dubai eating prawn
Fuck the roof like Obama
Land that helicopter right on the lawn
Hundred thou to perform
