[Intro]
Soulja, check out my neck
Look at my watch yeah
Soulja, King Soulja
I got all this money, all this money
Let's go

[Hook]
Mucho Guapo pronto, Mucho Guapo pronto
Mucho Guapo pronto, Mucho Guapo pronto
Hunnids to my back, tickets this is nachos
Hunnids in the front, cheese that is Guapo
Mucho Guapo pronto, Mucho Guapo pronto
Mucho Guapo pronto, Mucho Guapo pronto
Hunnids to the back, hunnids to my front

[Verse 1]
I just bought a chopper, Mucho Bullets pronto
I just fucked a thot, that ain't mad at me though
I get number gwap, Mucho Guapo Pronto
Pull up on your block, and my shooters unload
Ferro  Ferrogamo, bitches by the tumblr
Running like a NFL, and I run from em
Shooters on the playroll, from here San Diego
Touch down with the pack and then I'm making pesos
Touch down with them racks and now these niggas fake though
Mucho guapo pronto, bad bitch Toronto
I was in Brazil, south America, no [?]
Running with that sack I can get it 'cross the border

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Mucho guapo pronto, I'm the boss head honcho
Walking to their house, all you see is nothing but hundoes
30 with extendos, play you like Nintendo
I finesse em out the check, blow em like the window
AK-47 with a lot of clips
Riding around on the jet and I finesse
I got hunnids to my left, hunnids to the right
I got lean lean I pour it in my Sprite
Mucho codeine pronto, mucho lean and nachos
I got extra topics, pouring cheese on my taco
AK Soulja Guapo, money in my pocket
Takin' off on a jet like it's a rocket
In the air I finesse money out your pocket
Mucho boy stop, Gang got you locked
Riding round on a jet, you know I got it
Bang bang fire flame mucho mucho guap


[Hook]
