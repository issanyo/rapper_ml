[Chorus]
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
Pull up in a Porsche drop-top
Nigga, diamonds bling
Brand new Balenciaga's
It ain't nothing
Nigga, drip bang
Jump out the coupe
Dripping sauce
On the rap game

[Verse 1]
Diamonds, chain
Diamond, bling-bling
Hit the trap, hit the pot
Make it hurricane
Pull up drop-top Rover
Doing my thing
I just hopped out the Wraith
Diamonds on me VVS, outer space
Jump out the foreign and count up the cake
Hop in some Louis then jump in some BAPE
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
VVS look like a skating rink
Hit the shop
Beat up a brick make it earthquake
My diamond link chain, it look insane
Hop out the Rari and ice on my chain

[Chorus]
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
Pull up in a Porsche drop-top
Nigga, diamonds bling
Brand new Balenciaga's
It ain't nothing
Nigga, drip bang
Jump out the coupe
Drippin' sauce
On the rap game
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
Pull up in a Porsche drop-top
Nigga, diamonds bling
Brand new Balenciaga's
It ain't nothing
Nigga, drip bang
Jump out the coupe
Drippin' sauce
On the rap game

[Verse 2]
VVS diamond chain look insane
Brand new Bentley truck
I swerve in the turning lane
Fuck on your bitch
Then I jump on a plane
I just go VVS diamond my chain
Pull up in a Porsche
Just me and gang
Come to my trap
And I'm serving that crack, straight caine
Walk in the club and I make it rain
I got a VVS chain and it look like a hurricane
50 thousand in my Balmain's
I just called my jeweler, pull up with ice chains
Hop out the Rari
Then jump on the airplane
New VVS look like ice cream

[Chorus]
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
Pull up in a Porsche drop-top
Nigga, diamonds bling
Brand new Balenciaga's
It ain't nothing
Nigga, drip bang
Jump out the coupe
Drippin' sauce
On the rap game
Me and gang gang
Rock new chains
Pull up in a Porsche drop-top
Nigga, diamonds bling
Brand new Balenciaga's
It ain't nothing
Nigga, drip bang
Jump out the coupe
Drippin' sauce
On the rap game
