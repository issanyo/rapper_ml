[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Yo, man, real boss shit
Fuck the CEO of the mafia and shit
Feel like I'm at the top of the food chain, man
Big dog shit
Turn my vocals up

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Slide in that Porsche and I keep it 100
They call me King Soulja, ain't never scared to go get no money
Ain't never been scared to go get no money
Ain't never been scared to go get no money
Up in the block man I keep it 100
Pussy ass nigga ain't taking shit from me
Scared money don't make no money nigga
Ain't never been scared to go get that money
Ain't never been scared to go get some money
Ain't never been scared to go get that money
Ain't never been scared to go get some money
Go get some money, go get some money

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Sippin' on lean, eating steak
Call on my shooters they clap at your face
Lamborghini win a race
100 thousand in my briefcase
Sippin' lean on a highway
2015 Phantom sitting in the driveway
Smoking on kush like Friday
Feeling like Dej Loaf, let a nigga try me
Lamborghini cost me 5 keys
Switching the lane, turn on the high beams
Flipping the work like spatula
Giuseppe, Balenciaga, blood Dracula
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em spectacular
Donating money over to Africa
Hop in my whip, I go faster
Gucci, Louis, I'm the brand ambassador
Flipping the work like spatula
Giuseppe, Balenciaga blood Dracula
Flipping the work like spatula
Giuseppe, Balenciaga blood Dracula
Flipping the work like spatula
Giuseppe, Balenciaga blood Dracula
Flipping the work like spatula
Giuseppe, Balenciaga blood Dracula

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Slide in that Porsche and I keep it 100
They call me King Soulja, ain't never scared to go get no money
Ain't never been scared to go get no money
Ain't never been scared to go get no money
Up in the block man I keep it 100
Pussy ass nigga ain't taking shit from me
Scared money don't make no money nigga
Ain't never been scared to go get that money
Ain't never been scared to go get some money
Ain't never been scared to go get that money
Ain't never been scared to go get some money
Go get some money, go get some money

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Stuffing that kush in my swisher sweet
Riding that Phantom you know that I'm sippin' lean
Gucci and Louis my Robin's jeans
Double R, pulling up it's a murder scene
Lamborghini like a tangerine
Serving that work fresh off the balance beam
Pull up they looking like "who is he?"
All of this gold like No Limit, Master P
Pinky ring yeah that's half a key
Got some young niggas, you know they gonna blast for me
Hop on a scene and then tragedy
King Soulja, they address me as 'Majesty'
My trap jumping like a trampoline
Pouring double cups of the lean
Walk in, cashing out instantly
Spent seven hundred on Robin's jeans
