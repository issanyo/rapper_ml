[Intro]:
We back, its prime time rapping
Let's get into it over here man
We got the champion, Mr. Legendary himself, he don't lose
The only thing he do is win
Give it up for Supa Hot Fire!
Now, over here, we got Soulja Boy
But let's get to my boy right here, alright

[Verse 1: Supa Hot Fire]
You beating me? Now that's a mistake
When I park my car, I pull up the e-brake
You hear that? I'm buzzin';
Big family, no cousins
I get money. It's nothin'

Twelve job applications, all blank: I'm lazy
Two baby sitters, no babies
I spit hot fire, but I'm not a rapper
I come with the Supa Hot
And then bring the fire right after!

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Supa Hot Fire, I don't know what the fuss about
I splash on you everyday, I bet that put your fire out
King of the internet; I been that
Winning streaks; I end that
Looking through your glasses
I can see that you been wack
SIKE! You ain't going to get these back!
You know my name? (Ya, it's Soulja Boy Tell 'em)
He's a liar
Tattoos, diamonds, swag
Call me Soulja Hot Fire
Don't you get mad, this is just the beginning
Swag to the right, now go tell them fans I'm winning
Soulja Boy Tell 'em came through for the top spot
Take this picture; hashtag Soulja just beat Supa Hot

[Outro]
As you can see, Supa Hot, he lost man
Soulja, he came out, he did his thing
We got a new champion, man, this is crazy
Supa Hot he ain't coming back, his career's over
This is prime time rapping
