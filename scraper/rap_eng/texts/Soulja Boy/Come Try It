[Intro:]
Hey, they crowning me
They crowning me
Come try it, baby come try it
Come try it, baby come try it
Come try it, baby come try it
Come try it, baby come try it

[Verse: Soulja Boy]
Come try it, my diamonds a riot
We slippin' and slidin'
We ball till we fall
We got so many racks to blow
We got so many racks to blow
My shirt by Louis Vuitton
She think I'm the one
Just a young nigga that ran through the city
Whippin' and flippin' them chickens
I ride in the Bentley
My niggas, they all from the country
V-V-S diamonds and princess cuts
I'm shinin', I'm stuntin'
Yayo, yayo, all I know is yayo
Whippin' them chickens
Whippin' them chickens, no Crisco
We seeing money it's simple, Rolex Presidential

[Outro:]
You know I'm official, she know I'm official
You know I'm official, she know I'm official
Baby come try it, baby come try it
Baby come try it, baby come try it
Baby come try it, baby come try it
Come try it, my diamonds a riot
We slippin' and slidin'
Come try it, my diamonds a riot
We slippin' and slidin'
