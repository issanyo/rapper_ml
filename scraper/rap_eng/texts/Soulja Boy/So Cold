[Hook: Soulja Boy]
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
100 thousand dollars, that's in 2 days
Riding through the city, I get too paid
Hair weave killing like 2 Chainz
In the Phantom yeah I switch lanes
Baby girl you know you look so right
Hop up in my Phantom, here we go right
When we on a jet we fly so high
She know it, I be so fly

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hop up in the Rari and change your life
Looking at my diamonds, you see the ice
When I'm in the Phantom I swerve to the right
Money on me every day and every night
Baby girl you're fine, you look so fly
Hop up in my Lambo and take a ride
When we on an island you look so right
We can do this like all night

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
