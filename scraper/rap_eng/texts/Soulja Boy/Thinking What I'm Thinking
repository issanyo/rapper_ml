[Intro: Soulja Boy]
I do this for the real niggas
I do this for the trap
Any nigga that came from the bottom
This one for you

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I just got a house, I got another million
I got the Lamborghini, and I got the Bentley
100 million jug, nigga I'm getting it
A thousand on me, is you thinking what I'm thinking
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
100 million, a young nigga scheming
I just bought my mama a whip, is you thinking what I'm thinking
I got this 100 round clip, you leanin' you leanin'
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
I just got the new Lambo, drop it out the ceiling
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
I'm pouring the ace of spades in the lean, is you drinkin' what I'm drinking

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I got a house, and I got the Rari
I hop out the Lambo, I never say sorry
These niggas, they broke, and they is so sorry
I hop out the Lambo, the Panamera and I'm game like Atari
I'm with the old school like safari
100's on me when I step in the party
Niggas with me man they know that I'm gnarly
Screaming white boy when I'm poppin' the molly
She want the lean, yes she want the molly
She pop a molly, she hop out the Mase'
Hop out the Mase', the tats on my body
I got TMZ man they snap paparazzi, god damn
I hop out the car and the bitches they look like god damn
I hop out the whip, you know that I turn up, you know that my niggas go ham
And free all my niggas that locked up, you know that they in the slammer
I'm breaking you, can not touch this on like I'm MC Hammer

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I just got a house, I got another million
I got the Lamborghini, and I got the Bentley
A 100 million jug, nigga I'm getting it
A thousand on me, is you thinking what I'm thinking
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
100 million, a young nigga scheming
I just bought my mama a whip, is you thinking what I'm thinking
I got this 100 round clip, you leanin' you leanin'
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
I just got the new Lambo, drop it out the ceiling
Is you thinking what I'm thinking, Is you thinking what I'm thinking
I'm pouring the ace of spades in the lean, is you drinkin' what I'm drinking

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hop out the Rari they like damn
All this cash like Rambo
Hop out the Rari, I hop out the coupe then I hop in the Lambo
I put on some Bape and I pour up a 8 and my body go slow mo
I pull out the chopper, send you to the doctor, the doctor like oh no
He just like oh no
The money come in and nigga we spend it
Fuck you talking about, we don't got no limit
I step in the ceiling, we turn up the city
Hop out the Rari then hop in the Bentley
Nigga talking they ain't givin' opinion
Hop out the Rari, I just made a million
Just look at my face then you know that I'm killin' like
100 thousand in a minute, I'm killin' like
Hop out the Rari, you know that it's candy white
Young Soulja Tell 'Em, I'm killin' like every night
Swagger jackers watch, they stealing, they gonna bite
On TNT swag on a track I got dynamite
You thinking what I'm thinking, nigga we got it
Hop out the Rari, money in my pocket
I took off to outer space like I'm a rocket
Money be coming in, it's all in my pockets
She call me King Soulja Boy Tell 'Em Versace
Hop out the Rari, you know that I'm poppin'
She call me Lil Soulja, she call me Dre papi
God damn
