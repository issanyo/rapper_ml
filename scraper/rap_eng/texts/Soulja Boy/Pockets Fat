Got a new rollie, and I cope the new ap
Got all the bricks on me, and I got all the whips on me
Words to my mother, word to new york
Soulja boy stunner, kanye say new slave

Pockets fat no light bulb

Soulja, yeah I be told ya, whipping the rover
Chicken and chiefing, I walk in the Bentley
The ball of the century, I'm a guap till it's empty
So... spray, I'm killing the camp out, boom, bang, bang

My pockets fat no light bulb

Riding through in that new lac
Swear my diamonds look like a light show
I'm getting money like tyco
I'm getting money like Tyson
I'm getting money like a billion dollars
Like a million dollars that's come soon
Vacuum all the guap, that's vetuceen, want on top
She want a picture, just panorama
On the pj in my new pajamas
Riding round with that fucking hammer
Gucci, louie, hermans, Versace'
World tour, I touchdown
They see my face, they fuck with me
I'm getting cash, I'm getting guap
Yeah the shit is lovely

Your girlfriend she came here to see
Gave 50k just to make her see
'Is on my feet

I could rock the cold chilla, Gucci to the sweater
Guap down to my shoes, finessing marting margello
Swag so clean, I should have signed on rockofella, jay z
I be getting cash, I could rock it acapella
My pockets fat no light bulb
My pockets fat no light bulb
My pockets fat no light bulb
My girl go wherever I go
My pockets fat no light bulb
My pockets fat no light bulb
My pockets fat no light bulb
My girl go wherever I go
