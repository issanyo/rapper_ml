[Intro]
Soulja, Cinco
Whoa, swag
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Send them back a the back
How black motherfucking back home
Send them back a the back
Where the bad bitch trying to get back on
Sis have list to the right thrown
Am about hard to the right thrown
Have to go hard with the hell hole
In a strip club with a lot of hoe
With a lot of hoe, y'all niggas know how the life goes
With a lot a goals, top floor of the Bellagio
Suite full of them Spanish hoes, I can manage
Suite full of them Spanish hoes, I can manage yow

[Hook]
I don't know if you heard about me
But I don't know a thing about you
I don't know what you think about me
But baby it's the thing that you do
I'll be on the way up, and itâ€™s how you call
I'm on the way up
I'll be on the motherfucking way up

[Verse 2]
I'm a slide in your "rarri" rip it like hibachi
I got all this money on me, test up on my body
We pour actavis up in her drinks, she still [word unclear]
Yow, she fell in love with the codeine, hop up in her "rarri" drop the top on
You know widely quackles on my dumbbells
You rich nigga shit ensync, oh
Yeah money and no hoes up on single

[Hook]
On the way up, On the way up, On the way up
Hey, on the way
