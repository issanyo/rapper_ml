[Speakers Going Hammer]
I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (She got a donk)
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer
Speakers going hammer (Speakers going hammer?)
Speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer
Speakers going hammer (Speakers going hammer?)
