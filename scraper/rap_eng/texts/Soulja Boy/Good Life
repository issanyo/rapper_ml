[Chorus]
Welcome to the good life
If it dont cost a stack it dont look right
Make your main bitch look twice
Bitch welcome to the good life
Welcome to the good life
If it dont cost a stack it will look right
Make your main bitch look twice
Bitch welcome to the good life

Welcome to the life
Marble floors double doors

We're gonna eat some calamari pasta plus the steak
This state is so large is like a college,im talking, walking
