Back in the Trap with that crack
Ride around town with that MAC and that strap in my lap
50,000 in my Goyard bag
Yves Saint Laurent and my Balmain pants
Look at the way that my diamonds dance
I just did a show over in France
Ran a M up the first chance
I'm back in the Trap with that crack in advance
Back in the Trap with that crack
Ride around town with that MAC and that strap in my lap
50,000 in my Goyard bag
Yves Saint Laurent and my Balmain pants
Look at the way that my diamonds dance
I just did a show over in France
Ran a M up the first chance
I'm back in the Trap with that crack in advance

[Verse]
Back in the Trap with that strap in my lap
Bad bitch in the passenger with a brick sittin' in the back
State-to-state lil nigga I'm movin' that pack
Step in Balenciaga with the strap and them racks
Jump out the jet then I walk in the trap
He hadda run up the M where the fuck they do that at
2022 Bentley black
My left wrist a Patek, I'm sittin' in the trap with that strap
I am Big Soulja, I'm mixin' the soda
I'm meetin' my quota, my right wrist ebola
I pull up 2020 Range Rover
Standin' in the trap and I'm servin' that gas, smell the odor
Fake nigga pull up with that MAC-11
Don't try this shit nigga we send you to heaven
Mini Draco that my favorite weapon
Balenciaga in the Trap when I'm steppin'
