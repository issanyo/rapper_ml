Listen up pay attention it's a genius spittin'
Diss me last week, next week missin' fuck your opinion
I forgot to mention, I'm the best rapper if you don't like me diss me
Similar to Jbar I'm in a daze
S.O.D. got game like a fucking arcade
Shoot at you duck niggas like a fuckin' gun range
Hottest in the rap game; title I obtain
Sumo money, I got heavy paper
Press me it's going down like a elevator
I'm not political correct, I'm not a legislator
Cross tattoo below my eye rest in peace to all my haters
Nigga I don't play boy, I'm not Hugh Hefner
Bunnies in my mansion, and it ain't even Ester.(laughs)
Drop it drop it low girl
Futurism Chris Brown, I can transform her
I'm a fucking genius, Jimmy Neutron
Rich nigga shit, Grey Poupon
Beats: blazin' them, fans: amazing them
Water diamonds on my neck come and take a swim
Guard your life with them, cause you might drown
No lifeguard guaranteed you going down
Speaking to existence, nigga I'm the best
Open my Louis cases looking like a treasure chest
You don't want beef so stay outta harms way
Blow your legs off have you looking like a mermaid
Runnin' at the mouth shut you up like a suitcase
Eat any rapper I'll have his ass soufleed
All year 365, February to February
The only place where success comes before work is inside the dictionary

Niggas say I'm gassed up, fuck you mean? Fuck gasoline
Any rapper on any beat, I'll chop your head nigga gilitene
Fake rappers dissin' me like I would forget
Niggas say they gettin money but it's counterfeit
My name gigantic, I sink em, titanic
S.O.D. gang all my haters now panic
They thinking got dammit Soulja Boy's flow is Cajun
I'm drawing on this beat do you get the illustration?
Everybody hate it
I'm balling so hard I should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated
Yeah I navigate it, then escalade it
Twitter king 2 million in your faces
I'm saying my graces, I'm bout to eat all of ya
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em I'm a one man orchestra
Instructional videos on you tube
So I can teach you how to do what I do
Haters wanna knock me, but I'm not a damn door
I got a million dollars cash laid across this damn floor
Word around town they got money on my head
Bitch I pull that fuckin chopper and they scramble like eggs
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em that this shit is historical
All the newspapers put this in your editorial
Teach you niggas, swag tutorial
Got a lot of haters, fuck it I want more of ya
RIP all rappers, shout out to young memorial
Don't ask me if I wanna fuck this, cause that question is rhetorical
GOT DAMN!
