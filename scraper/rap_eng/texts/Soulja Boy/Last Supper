[Intro]
I wanna fuckin feel this shit, y'know?
You already know, bandkids to fuck with me
Bad boy
Huh, huh
Sauve

[Sauve]
Niggas chose 15 seconds of fame
Over the 15 seconds of reign
VVS diamonds, they shine in the rain
[?]
Pour it up back, I remember the pain
Thinking back, everyday I used to train
I was dead broke, used to rock a fake chain
Now every-day, we hop on a plane
Did a few shows, [?]
Save that shit up, it's about to get rainy
[?]
Momma said [?] this gun, for her safety
Bitch so bad, might give her a baby
She so happy, you  hit on the daily
Offer the [?], he be talking 'bout ladies

Have to shoot that nigga, what time, nigga?
And it's all black (black)

Got two bad hoe's, fuck her, yeah
Shoot them with 12, [?], yeah
Little handshake, then, fuck her
Why you on her, like it's her last supper?

Yeah, yeah, and I'm drippin' like water
Ooh, yeah, bounce back and I'll fuck on your thot, mmh
Yeah, twenty shows, I don't know where I'm at
Yeah, fifty bands on my [?] sack

[Sauve]
Y-yeah, Trix are for kids
I throw the money, just for the bands
Bellows, just strip a big booty babe
I hit that bitch in the back of my crib

[?]
Lil nigga talking, he know that I made it
Shoot, choppa [?]
Yeah, These niggas talking, they definitely know that I made it

[Soulja Boy]
Yeah, yuh nigga eat your motherfuckin' plate
Pop in the ‘gatti and now I'm in the race
Whippin' up dope right in your face
Calling my lawyer, I'm getting a case

[Lil Mosey]
I'm with Soulja, hop in a rover
I thought I told you, we 'takin over
Whippin up bands, [?]
Smoking on dope

Postin’ on block [?]
[?] don’t make a sound
[?] bean [?] Glock [?]

[Sauve]
Bandkids, we blow like a bomb, got the world in my palm
I got some money, gave it to my mom
And she bought us a lawn
Hit the lil bitch then I pass the baton
I take a flight to Milan
Bad bitch, she [?]

Niggas gonna hate when they bangin’ my song
I'm at the top, king kong
Back in my high school, y'all didn't get along
Everything I do is wrong
Bitch got a [?] thong
Cut the dummies on me, prom
You know what we smokin, we smokin this strong, as if I didn't belong

[Soulja Boy]
No, you don't want smoke
Big Draco at your front door, we pose
Make a wrong move, shoot off your nose
Shot out the Benz, my young nigga kick in your door

I need some lean, pour up a four
Fuck it, fucking your bitch, fucking your ho
Yuh, the diamond chain rainbow
I put the rap game in the three-four
