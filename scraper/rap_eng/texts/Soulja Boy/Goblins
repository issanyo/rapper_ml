[Intro]
Rich Gang
S.O.D
Soulja

[Hook]
All of my niggas they goblins
Pull up on the scene my niggas gon pop ya
You ain't bullet proof that chopper gon stop ya
Pull up on yo block grippin a chopper
Hot technique I'm pullin' on activist
Hit the road go on tour with some savages
Hundred thousand on me know that I'm having it
Special order then I ship it and package it
Make some [?] a young nigga cappin it
Hit the club with a thirty know I'm packing it
Fuck nigga try to rob us
Soulja the chopper shoot make a nigga do back flips
Ready to rock out the thirty sit on my hip
I sent a hundred junkies on a quick trip
Try to rob Soulja that's bad fo yo health
A lot of big bag we’ll put it in the air

[Verse 1]
Zone one west side we some savages
Rich gang lil nigga we having it
My lil' nigga robbing and shooting and trapping shit
Banging blood on that stacks on that money shit
Trap out the mansion my house is immaculate
Try to rob Soulja my shooters ain't having it
Big old tuka on the side and they blasting it
Mack eleven on my lap know I keep a strap
[?] soulja you bound to get kidnapped
Run in your house now you can’t get your shit back
Fifty bricks nigga know imma flip that
Pull out that Drako pussy nigga get back
Call up my jeweler he give me some stupid ice
Finesse the nigga I sold him a dummy pipe
We can't do business nigga hit the [?]
Shoot you these bullets they hit you like dynamite
Pouring on activist sippin' on jerry sprite
I escaped with the K and I ain't coming back
Went out with a hundred pounds just like a running back
Catch me in the chopper I [?]
In the trap with the kitchen and I'm whippin
You know a young nigga all about paper
Blowing on cookies I got different flavors
Garcia Vega trap got acres

[Hook]
All of my niggas they goblins
Pull up on the scene my niggas gon pop ya
You ain't bullet proof that chopper gon stop ya
Pull up on yo block grippin a chopper
Hot technique I'm pullin' on activist
Hit the road go on tour with some savages
Hundred thousand on me know that I'm having it
Special order then I ship it and package it
Make some [?] a young nigga cappin it
Hit the club with a thirty know I'm packing it
Fuck nigga try to rob us
Soulja the chopper shoot make a nigga do back flips
Ready to rock out the thirty sit on my hip
I sent a hundred junkies on a quick trip
Try to rob Soulja that's bad fo yo health
A lot of big bag we’ll put it in the air
