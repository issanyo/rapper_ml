[Hook]
100k Came In Oooh
Hop in the Ferrari and go zoom
A Megastar just walked inside the room
Sweep the money up with a broom
(2x)

[Verse]
Crossover the gang and you doomed
I stacked my money up to the moon
I got a Maserati it's maroon
When I pour that drank I feel like tune
I'm street smart don't play me like a fool
I'm book smart just read about my moves
Run that money up thats what I do
Ride around the city with the crew
Drop that top back the lamb its a fool
Swervin lane to lane thats my move
Lane to lane yeah I lane switch
Double brain switch, stick shift no auto kit
When I pull up and I skrt skrt hopping out the whip
All my diamonds drip, diamonds glisten
Oh the bust down AP 50 bricks
Skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt when I whip my wrist
Back up in the trap with a pack and a 100 bricks
