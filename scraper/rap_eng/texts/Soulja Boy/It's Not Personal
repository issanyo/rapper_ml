[Intro]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you one time
There's no need to worry about nothin'

[Verse 1]
Girl I know that you feel like these dudes out here working you
Girl I just wanna tell you that it is not personal
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no
I just want you to know that it's not personal
Girl I know that you have a lock [?]
Girl I just want you to know that it's killing all of them, you so blind
And I want you to know
That it's not personal
And I want you to know
That I'm not workin' you
I don't want you to put yo' emotions in something that won't work
I don't want you to feel like I am using you cause I'm not
Girl I know that you feel like these dudes out here working you
Girl I just wanna tell you that it is not personal
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no
I just want you to know that it's not personal

[Verse 2]
Girl I seen you lie with your friends, just kickin' at the mall
And you, you
You
You
It's not personal
I'm not just workin' you
I want you to know that I seen you [?] care about you
Girl I know that you feel like these dudes out here working you
Girl I just wanna tell you that it is not personal
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no
I just want you to know that it's not personal
