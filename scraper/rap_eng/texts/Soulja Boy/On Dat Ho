[Verse 1: Jazz Lazer]
I just kicked it to her Michael Jackson, on that ho
Until she singing on my mike like Toni Braxton, on that ho
Then I Regie Nobo, time for some action, on that ho
Watch this, watch this, watch this
Ok, like Bobby Brown we can get it cracking, on that ho
Green bag bitch, you know what I’m packing, on that ho
I ain’t no pimp but I’m macking, on that ho
Watch this, watch this, watch this
I be like fuck it, and get the mean mugging, on that ho
Yeah we be bucking if you niggas style something
Like in the A, magic city strip clubbing, on that ho
Make it rain like

[Hook: Jazz Lazer]
Watch this, watch this, watch this
I south side, on that ho
I east side, on that ho
I west side, on that ho
I north side, on that ho
Now do your dance, on that ho
Do your dance, on that ho
Watch this, watch this, watch this

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
On yellow diamond Shawty, on that ho
Pull up in that brand new Audi, on that ho
I turned up the party, on that ho
And Shawty going so hard, she on the molly
It’s NBA how I bal, on that ho
Soulja boy hit the mall with Marley mall, on that ho
And I’m flying off on a private jet, on that ho
And I got a Porsche sitting on my neck, on that ho
You know I keep my swagger, on that ho
And you pull up on that brand new phantom, on that ho
Hey, watch me hit that 2 chainz, on that ho
Then I tell her bring it while she twerking on the floor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jazz Lazer]
I’m the king, on that ho
Do it big, on that ho
Pop a band, on that ho
Whoop my dick, on that ho
Now do your dance, on that ho
Do your dance, on that ho, do your dance
Watch this, watch this
Now when I pull up, you know it’s something foreign, on that ho
And with them diamonds on, you know they ain’t ignoring, on that ho
And if she got an ass like a horse, I’m Ralph Lauren, on that ho
Polo, polo, polo, polo
Ok my niggas got keys like the doorman, on that ho
We make them stretch like when you wake up in the morning, on that ho
I get around and I ain’t even started touring, on that ho
Watch this, watch this, watch this
She said I got the fucking formula
Cause I got her trying angles like Bermuda, on that ho
Oh you didn’t know? I invented kamasutra, on that ho
Break that, break that
I’m almost done, but that don’t mean I’m finished, on that ho
Paper like a book and you ain’t got a sentence, on that ho
I’m not a bizness man, I’m a bizness, on that ho

[Hook]
