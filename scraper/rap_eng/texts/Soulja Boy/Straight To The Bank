[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Ay, shoot a nigga ‘til he dead
Seven hundred for a pint of red
Hop out the Rari, you heard what I said
Young nigga shoot you in your head
Half of them niggas ain’t did what I did
Smoking on gas, you smoking on mid
Designer everything, fuck with the kid
Swerve the Lambo through Atlanta
Scarface, west side, Tony Montana
Pour up a four, Gucci bandana
Dipset, Juelz Santana
Fifty thousand for my pinky ring
Another 60 thousand just for the Cuban link
Pouring up Act and I’m pouring up red
Mix the two and the two, man you know that I’m drinking lean

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Posted on the block with blocks like a [?]
Got too many bitches, I need me a storage
Walk around leaving blood on the floor
Dead people everywhere like a morgue
Go to the bank in my Soulja Boys
I’m rocking designers, you can’t afford
You a little boy, nigga still on the porch
I got big bricks, little Honda Accord
Nigga don’t ask what I paid for it
Bury that money like graveyard
Me and Soulja got more money than Floyd
Keep the chopper on me, nigga I’m paranoid
Trap nigga, I be serving that brack
Lamborghini got a stick like Atari
Pull up to the bank and make a deposit
Plug saying that he gon’ be here tomorrow

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank
