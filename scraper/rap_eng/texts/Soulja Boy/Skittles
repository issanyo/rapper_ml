[Intro:]
Turn off, turn on, man
King Soulija, two!
Yea, the movie!
Turn off, turn on, man
Salute me!
Money scales, nigga
SODNG!
Got all the bitches
We're on tour!
Soulija, Soulija, hey!

[Hook:]
Busting jewels, busting jewels
Make it play, make it play (racks)
I got bands on me
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
She got skittles on her
Different covers on my chain
You got money and worst
I got skittles on me
She got skittles on her
I got skittles on me
Different covers on my chain
Different covers on my watch
Different covers on my ring
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me

Busting jewels, busting jewels
Make it play, make it play
I got all these bands
I got guap on me
Got a new Rolex and a couple AP
All these gold bricks, bitches, SOD
I'm a work with the fork
Shut it to New York
Soulija took the game and I made it work!
Let's get it!
She kick shit like Lou King
Soulija wore right, ice new chains
I think it's about time for a fucking new king
Made niggas tripping, go and tie you shoe strings
Soulija got new kicks, some like Jay-Z
My diamonds, they look like a light show
I'm getting the cash, no '
I'm iPhone, no eye scope
And I'm on with no eyes on!

[Hook:]
Busting jewels, busting jewels
Make it play, make it play
I got all these bands
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
Different covers on my chain
Different covers on my ring
Busting jewels, busting jewels
Make it play, make it play
I got bands on me
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me

My diamonds looking incredible
Soulija boy get guap and I am more guap on my schedule
Rich game, we're ahead of you
Second, no catching my revenue
New Bentley coop on no twenty-two
That Lamborghini was brand new
Got brand new jewels and shiny shoes
Owned the G, five protégés
Make yee screaming my name
Who's that?
I got new shoes, I got new jewels
Ten rings and ten chains
New whips, new ice
Damn! This is a life!
Throw a' in his shoes
SOD, rare jewels
Groovers cruise the way I cruise
Coop control, Mountail Dew
... she say she love me
That's the Molly talking!
Soldier boy, keep her alcoholic
I'm am alcoholic, shopaholic
Make a movie, I love Fendi, love Gucci
She can't have it, she wanna do it!

[Outro:]
Turn up with the'
Make it play, make it play
All day, out of space
Ya niggas throw it up, man
Let's get it!
