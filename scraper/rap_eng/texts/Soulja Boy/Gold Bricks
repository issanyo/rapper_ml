[Verse]
If it ain't one thing, it's another
Riding in that Bugatti, that shit is nuthin'
Lil Dre a.k.a Gold Everything
Watch a muthafuckin' face come up off the game
Lil Dre I splash, ready for the action
You know I'm on that gold, seven on that platinum
What's the fuckin word? What's the word, dawg?
And word around town, I'ma splurge tho
Cashed up, better say that
See me in the trap, lil nigga, we don't play that
Mix the xan with the lean, mix the purp with them beams
God damn, I fell out a dream
And I'm racked up for real, and I got a gold grill
And I got 37 mill
Fuck how a nigga feel, I'ma keep the shit trill
Man, I swear I'm too real, oh
You better say that
See me in the Bentley 2012, I don't play that
Knowing where I stay that, somewhere by the ocean
And I'm smoked out, 3rd eye open
Cashed up money, nigga, know that it's a homicide
Disrespect my game, bitch, that's suicide
And I'm riding and my pockets on stupid loud
And it's going up, and it's going down
You better say that
You better say that
Gold Bricks (Gold Bricks)
Gold Bricks (Bricks)
Gold Bricks (Bricks)
You already know
And niggas still on that sucka shit
I'ma come through in another whip
I'm iced out, you already know
Young nigga came to steal the show
You better say that
See me in the trap, lil nigga, we don't play that
Long ass chopper on my side, I spray that
Hit the club, V.I.P, spend about 8 racks
You already know
Looking at my neck, everything gold
Homie want his bitch, but the hoe chose
It don't really matter, you already know
You better say that
See me in the VIP, lil nigga, we don't play that
Long chopper, might spray that
Bitch, get Back
Bitch, stay back
Fuck what you heard, it's Ocean Gang
Oh, oh
Gold Bricks (Bricks)
Gold Bricks (Bricks)
Gold Bricks (Gold Bricks)
Gold Bricks
