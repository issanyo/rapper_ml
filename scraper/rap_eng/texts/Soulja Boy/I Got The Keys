[Intro]
Soulja
I got the keys

[Verse 1]
Take a trip out to New York
I scrape the power to folk
Yall niggas going to court
I ball out like I'm on coke
Yall niggas whippin the pack
Scrapping the power to folk
Take a trip back to New York
I'm in the Xan with the bow
I met the power to folk
I hit the pot with the four
I hit the pot with the four
I hit the pot with the four
Yall niggas whippin up dope
Young nigga whippin the dope
Young nigga whippin up dope
Young nigga whippin up dope
I'm in the van with the xany
I run with niggas they shining
Young nigga hop out the Rari
Nigga I never say sorry
Imma put [?] in the molly
Imma put [?] in the molly
Tattoos they cover my body
Tattoos they cover my body
Young nigga is at the party
I just cashed out in the Rari
I just pulled up a new paint
I mix the lean with the sprite
I mix the lean with the phantom and diamond daze
The diamond coming out nice
Nigga be high as a kite
Nigga be leaning all night
I'm in the two with the four
Just seven walking straight out the store
In the trap we with the bow
In the trap we with the bow
Million design with the lean
Young nigga feel like a king

Young nigga whippin the pot
Grippin the pot

All of my niggas they up

Mostly we trap out the block
Standing out break out the pot
Niggas they whip through the block
Stank up a nut
Young nigga straight out the lot
Young nigga fuck with the pot
Fucked up the pot
