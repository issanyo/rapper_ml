My nigga young low did a lot of stunnin
That louie brief case that's a lot of money
I hit the block with a ton of chronic
You see my closet, that's a ton of money
These niggas talking but don't know the words
Word around town my niggas steady of flipping work
For what you heard, I grind hard
So every time you see me bitch I shine hard
Rolex, that's fifteen
Whole block, about ten beans
Infrared on the silencer
Disrespect young low I might silence ya
It's Soulja Boy in from the ocean
Gold on deck wiping Bentley slow motion
Middle finger to the fucking sky
I'm getting money, counting bread while I'm stupid high
