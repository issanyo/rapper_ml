[Chorus]
When we start dancing
What we do. We hurt they feelings
When we start dancing
What we do. We hurt the feelings

Security step up deep [4x]

Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico. Whoop rico. Whoop rico and break his neck. [2x]

Boss
Go step to my battle field
Where my niggas come from
All we know is kill bill. That's right
Breakin neck. We ain't showing no respect
Try me. Some niggas at no will
Now watch me slow it down and then I take it in slow motion
And then I speed it up. And take it fast like a nigga on a top speed coaster
Now where my goons at?
Load em up. Take aim and we ready to attack
And ain’t no backin down
We go pound for pound. Round for round. We knock em down
Now if you think you got them hands. And nigga that's the plan
Ima knock yo ass down like the black Jackie chan
The squad ain’t loosing. These bitches keep choosing
And that’s why (ay, ay)

Smurf
Let me get em. Man I gotta hit the flo
Step into my fighting stand. And then I crank that rambo
Anyone can come and get it
It's a war that I declare
If you want a double duo. Then I bring out yogi-bear
Watch us hit you left and right
Combos coming once or twice
We becomin stupid fast. Have yo whole clique scarred for life
Flawless victory on deck
But its time for round two
Put my hands up on my hips
Then I crank my Scooby-doo

Chorus
When we start dancing
What we do? We hurt they feelings
When we start dancing
What we do? We hurt the feelings

Security step up deep [4x]

Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico. Whoop rico. Whoop rico and break his neck. [2x]

Mike Dingo
Ay. They love to see me move
Me and my whole crew

Cuz everytime I lean they watch spectators try to do it too
So they keep on hesitating & hate, I put em in they place
I call my boy Tookie then we whoop rico in his face
No time to conversate
This ain’t the time or place. Watch me have to whoop a nigga ass
Like my name was Billy blanks
This left a leave ya
Then my dance, we crucial like brutality
We leave yall whole click stuck. Like we stole the damn scene

Trez
They said em twice. Another third times a charm
But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain’t no harm
He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can’t do it quite like me
Cuz he keep doing the same ole move, constantly
Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flo
Bout to get real crazy, dont turn yo head. We bout to start the show
First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head
Roll yo arms and show yo swagg. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea)

Chorus
When we start dancing
What we do. We hurt they feelings
When we start dancing
What we do. We hurt the feelings

Security step up deep [4x]

Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico and break his neck
Whoop rico. Whoop rico. Whoop rico and break his neck. [2x]
