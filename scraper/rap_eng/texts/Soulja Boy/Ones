[Intro: Soulja Boy & Young L]
Soulja, Soulja, Soulja
Soulja, Dragger, Mario
Mario, Domo, Dragger

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I’m too official
I keep a pistol
Came out the water like olympic swimmer
I sip lean, chase it with liquor
Her ass fat I’m gonna hit her
Ocean Gang my fucking team
Catch us in the water like a submarine
I get paid, eat like a king
I look like I fell out a dream
Hate it or love it
I ball and you dodge it
They ball on a budget
I ball like it’s nothing
I came out the water you came out the pussy
Life on the edge [?]
Nigga don’t push me
Iced out like a wedding cake
I’m so high nigga half baked
Pretty nigga with a fucking chopper
Came out the water like a damn piranha

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones

[Verse 2: Young L]
Motherfucker my nigga (Yes sir)
I styled on these basic bitches
Hitting corners on these fake niggas
Legendary make you say it nigga (LGND)
I’m [?]
Anything on rabbi
Anything on my feet
Gucci, Louis, Fendi
These about fifteen
When I was bout fifteen
I was bout that cream
Talking to hoes and selling them dreams
Popped the hoes like center folds
Legends take time like a Ferris wheel
Got pill bottles like Dr. Phil
Punch in the front like a phantom thrill

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
Buffer buffer fine fine
Throwin throwing ones ones
