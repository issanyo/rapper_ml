[Intro]
Drako
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah
Young nigga hit the block and go re-up
I sell a brick then I go kick my feet up
Chopper on me, nigga don't think about runnin’ up
Fuck with gang, nigga you gon get an upper-cut
100K cash, nigga and it's duffel'd up
Young nigga go stuff a brick in the muffler
Stacks On Deck Money Gang on some other stuff
Pour up the lean, drop a deuce in my double cup

[Verse]
Chop up a brick, karate kick
Lamborghini Huracan, customize kick
Jump out the whip, Maison Margiela karate kick
Young nigga feel like the President
Ran up them M’s, that's evident
Spent 3 million dollars for a new residence
Montana rollie wrist, hit 'em with dummy bricks
I'm in yo bitch mouth like toothpick (uh)
I'm yo bitch mouth just like toothpicks
Strapped nigga, ridin' round the city with 2 bricks
I feel like Max Payne, nigga I got 2 sticks
Niggas talk shit, but ain't gon do shit
Chopper stick like a pool stick
Aim with that 30, I shoot with my new clip
30 clip long like a broomstick
Celebrate it, then go hop out a new whip (dope)
White Maserati like cool whip (uh)
I'm in the trenches with 2 bricks
I got a red and a blue pit’
Punch a nigga, chop a brick up, combo shit
Hop out the Wraith, count up dead presidents
Maison Margiela my new fit
I got this shit from the streets, I don’t need no stylist
This shit on me, nigga can't pay for this
I guess a nigga wanna beef with me cause I been fuckin’ his bitch
Jump Out Boyz, hop out with that helicopter
Chopper tour bus, followed by the limousine
Should have won a car show, I had the clean whip
2 rollies on my left wrist
They'll wipe you down, slime you down
On some Stacks On Deck Money Gang shit
Hand in hand, nigga keep a brick
In and out the VIP
Cleanest nigga when I walked in this bitch
VVS from my jewler ain't no [?] round here
[?] just to see this shit
FNN sittin' on my fuckin’ hip
Hit the casino, got poker chip
Bad bitch starin' at me, pokin' out her hip
Dip through the back quick, hittin' it from the rear
Audi A8 to the 6th gear
Young Drako, nigga I'm the trapper of the year
Drako!

[Chorus]
Young nigga hit the block and go re-up
I sell a brick then I go kick my feet up
Chopper on me, nigga don't think about runnin' up
Fuck with gang, nigga you gon get an upper-cut
100K cash, nigga and it's duffel'd up
Young nigga go stuff a brick in the muffler
Stacks On Deck Money Gang on some other stuff
Pour up the lean, drop a deuce in my double cup (lean!)

[Outro]
Drako! (woo)
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
