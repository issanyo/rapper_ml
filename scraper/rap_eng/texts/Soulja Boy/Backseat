[Intro - The Weeknd]
They wanna threesome, then some
Spend whatever come in, fucking income
Me and my niggas we're never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it get to
Living dreams we can never afford
Now we sitting in the backseat
Backseat [x17]

[Verse - Soulja Boy]
I got tattoos all over me, and she fuck with that
I pull up in foreign whips, and she fuck with that
A boss nigga, all the lame niggas copy cat
I pull up in that phantom, and she in that jag
Tattoos all up on my chest, on my neck and back
I'm getting money sipping lean, nothing but act
A million dollars, that's nothing but taxes
I ball out everyday, I don't know how to act
I'm dropping the top on my 'rari
They stare at me when I'm in the party
I said "baby we made it", she said "baby we did"
I'm stunting on these fuck niggas, they know what it is
Now we in the backseat, turning up
And she high off the kush, we burning up
She roll one and smoke it, and we rolling
You already know, you know how this shit go

[Outro - The Weeknd]
