Well if it isn't Mr. Beezy the Kingpin
Riding down my hood, in that yellow crown vet
All my niggas know that I got the Benz
I 'on want them niggas know what I'm reppin bitch
Same shit, nigga it's a majesty
On that fuckin hood, nigga rest in peace to Eazy E
Lil Soulja B, aka S.Beezy
Ridin' through my trap
Making it look so damn easy
My pockets looking lovely
Niggas on that paper chase
Caked up Soulja Boy, all about that grape swisher
I broke it down
Nigga up in my town we gettin' HIGH
Nigga know what it is
Nigga do or die
Young ass Beezy on that motherfuckin paper chase
Everytime I ride, you know ima get it straight
Niggas don't know bout that motherfuckin weapon
Come through on your ass, when I tote that Smith-n-westin
In the mothafuckin club, show me love
They pouring up and playing all my music
SOD anthem, it's a party
Hoes on my dick, that's whats up
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em with that lean in my cup
Double cup

Bottles of Rozay
She say she like that ciroc, that vodka
That's okay with me
Lil Dre, ima rep it how I pose up

Niggas show me love when they see me on that slap
Young Soulja Boy, nigga know I'm goin in

Underneath the pillow, where the dope at
Police tryin to slow me up
Ridin thru my park like
"Nigga what the fuck"
Bustin at me, he's a bitch so I hit the po
Nigga knows whats up, I'm fuckin with the whole crew
Duffle bag birds in that back of that trunk
I dont hope I get caught, so I'm toting on the pump
Niggas know whats up

Ridin thru my hood, police can't touch me
Everywhere I go nigga, I'm looking so clean
Red carpet on that shades, sippin on promynthazine
Young nigga all bout his fuckin doe
Everybody know, I got it for the low
Its that young ass nigga reppin SOD gang
S.Beezy just another day, all up on that paper chase
Young nigga pulled up and the hoes was on his cock
He had to watch out for them haters and them crooked cops
Them niggas want to see you down when you doing good
Got a million in the bank, well that's all good
They want to see you fall, they want to bust your ass
In my hood, ain't no love for your snitch ass
Nigga keep your mouth closed about that business
In the mothafuckin street, nigga please pay attention
