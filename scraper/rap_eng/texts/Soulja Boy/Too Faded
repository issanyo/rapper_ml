[Verse 1 : Game]
Hey yo I’m full of that purp
Can’t be fucked with when I’m rollin’
I like that backwood up and put that sun roof in motion
I hit the block like what, them boys can’t fuck with that phantom
Put them 6s down in buck kid, I fuck with Atlanta
Got that huge blow and rocks up in this
Shining like the staple center lights when Kobe go for 40 looking like mike!
Don’t compare me to these rap niggas I’m not like ‘em, I swear to God
I did went through hurt before, Chris Humphrey my dick big
You can ask the broads, I like my bitch authentic no fake
Titties or ass
When she do I Ricky ruby on that ho, I pass
Since tall [?] fucking with the lights out
When the shit on like a [?] I fight though
I don’t wanna fight though, wanna lose your life though
So pull a 38 on yeah, turn a nigga mike on

Yeah, I’m fucked up and they hating
Turn all these rap niggas into blood zulu nation
Yeah, soldiers, the diamonds in your chain
Bigger than that nigga face and that’s foul, game

[Hook : Soulja Boy]
I’m fucked up and I’m faded
I said I’m fucked up and I’m faded
We got peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron
Faded, I’m faded, faded
She faded, faded, he faded, faded, we faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, I’m fucked up

[Verse 2 : Soulja Boy]
Puff pop and I pass on, rich nigga young asshole
Fuck you trying to tell me, go bars for the cash bro
I took charge and I went hard
Held it down for my fuck squad
Fuck you niggas talk about
Time we bring them racks out
Welcome to my spaceship, that shit look like a trap house
Go ahead and bring the Benz out
Recoup your ho and we freezed up
Pound [?] that’s a beat up, 50 k on my sleeve bro
And I’m fresh fuck and my sleeve up
These niggas riding won’t be us
Everyday we get the bump, riding round smokin’ grind
2012 red Bentley mean, gang driving through compton
Bad bitches by the dozen, no police I ain’t coughing
And niggas saying they got swag
But it’s money gang or nothing
I’m high as fuck see it in my eyes
Shouts out game that number 5
Fresh as fuck till a nigga die
Gonna write my name up in the sky
Fick you niggas talking bout, we get cash by large amounts
I’m fucked up and I’m faded, got a mansion up in Las Vegas

[Hook]
I’m fucked up and I’m faded
I said I’m fucked up and I’m faded
We got peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron
Faded, I’m faded, faded
She faded, faded, he faded, faded, we faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, I’m fucked up
