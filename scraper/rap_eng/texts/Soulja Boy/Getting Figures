[Chorus:]
Still in the trap getting money my nigga
Everybody know Soulja Boy is getting figures
Hunnid rounds in the chopper little pussy ass nigga
I’m a kill your whole squad and who ever ride with ya
Getting Figures, I’m getting Figures
Yeah the whole trap know I’m getting money nigga
100 rounds in the drum little pussy ass nigga
Ask about lil’ Soulja Boy and they know I’m getting figures

[Verse 1:]
100,000 on my watch little nigga
I know that she ain’t getting money and getting no figures
In the trap I ride ‘Rari and Lamborghinis lil’ nigga
You ain’t selling no bricks who you think you tricking nigga
Just to get my fucking Glock
You know anti Shani nigga
If I kick her with the block then you know I ain’t snitching
I’m a young rich nigga 50,000 on my ring
When I step inside the mall I’m a buy everything
I’ve been trapping all year from the winter to the spring
Bitches jumping on my dick like it’s a trampoline
Lot of money on me yeah you know I’m rich nigga
Yeah I shot you and your clique you a bitch ass nigga

[Chorus:]
Still in the trap getting money my nigga
Everybody know Soulja Boy is getting figures
Hunnid rounds in the chopper little pussy ass nigga
I’m a kill your whole squad and who ever ride with ya
Getting Figures, I’m getting Figures
Yeah the whole trap know I’m getting money nigga
100 rounds in the drum little pussy ass nigga
Ask about lil’ Soulja Boy and they know I’m getting figures

[Verse 2:]
ATM West side I’m from zone one
Nigga tried to rob me for my chain

Picked up the chopper I was scar faced
Hey call up my lawyer and then he kill the case
Ain’t no snitch dang it Soulja Boy snitching lil’ nigga
I’ll kill your whole clique and dump your body in a river
You ain’t getting to the money lil’ broke ass nigga
I’ll be riding in the low low a hundred spokes nigga

If you disrespect the gang then you know I’ll pull the trigger
Riding round town you know Soulja got them bricks bitch nigga

[Chorus:]
Still in the trap getting money my nigga
Everybody know Soulja Boy is getting figures
Hunnid rounds in the chopper little pussy ass nigga
I’m a kill your whole squad and who ever ride with ya
Getting Figures, I’m getting Figures
Yeah the whole trap know I’m getting money nigga
100 rounds in the drum little pussy ass nigga
Ask about lil’ Soulja Boy and they know I’m getting figures
