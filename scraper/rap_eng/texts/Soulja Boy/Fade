[Chorus]
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
AK-47, nigga broad-
We could catch fades
Ay nigga, we could catch fades
Nigga, I'm getting money, nigga broad day with an AK
Nigga, we could catch a fade
Ay, where you at nigga? We could catch a fade
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades

[Verse 1]
I ain't never been scared, nigga pop out
Yeah, AK-47, nigga I ain't ever copped out
Young Drako, I bring the guap out (Drako)
Nigga keep playing 'til a young nigga pop out
Ay, fuck nigga, you's a bitch
Everybody know Young Drako been rich (Gang)
Riding round town with a new bad bitch (Gang)
Make the wrong move and my niggas gon empty the clip
I'm in Las Vegas and I ball on the strip
Pussy ass nigga, 30 clip on my hip
Make the wrong move, I'ma shoot (Boom)
Ay, I just had to jump out the sunroof
Pussy ass niggas still talking (Still talking)
That AK-47 leave a nigga, he can't walk, man
Ay, I came up in the streets, I had to walk, man
I let choppers [?]

[Chorus]
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
AK-47, nigga broad-
We could catch fades
Ay nigga, we could catch fades
Nigga, I'm getting money, nigga broad day with an AK
Nigga, we could catch a fade
Ay, where you at nigga? We could catch a fade
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades

[Verse 2]
Bitch nigga, where you at?
Drop your location, I'ma pull out, you know I got them racks
Young Drako, nigga I'm worth 30 M's (Gang)
I broke my wrist when I jumped out the gym (On God)
I got a swimming pool at my crib but I can't swim (No)
Fuck on your bitch, man get this on film (Smash)
Pussy ass nigga, stomp him out with some Timbs (Bitch)
Young Drako, nigga you know I go in
Yeah, and we could catch fades
Meet me in the hood, shoot it up, broad day
Pussy nigga, stop talking (What?)
Ay, punch that nigga in the face like he can't walk, now he handicapped
Riding round town with like hella straps (Bitch)
Nigga talk shit, that Draco got kickback (Boom)
Pussy nigga, you don't want no smoke
AK47, 23 bullets hit a nigga throat

[Chorus]
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
Lil nigga, we could catch fades
AK-47, nigga broad-
We could catch fades
Ay nigga, we could catch fades
Nigga, I'm getting money, nigga broad day with an AK
Nigga, we could catch a fade
Ay, where you at nigga? We could catch a fade
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades
Ay, lil nigga we could catch fades
