Smokin' on dope like the Haitians
Can't fuck with the bitch if she basic
Pull up right on you, just see your location
Rollin' up Backwoods and Garcia Vegas
I get the money, I don't have no patience
Hop on the jet and I go to Las Vegas
Whippin' my wrist, man a young nigga famous
.223 bullets, I'm grippin' the stainless
Rockstar, rockstar, yeah I need two cups
Rockstar, rockstar, yeah and I'm piped up
Walk up in the club and I got 10 bad bitches
Make it rain in this bitch
Make it splash in this bitch

Trap nigga all about cash

Runnin' my check up so fast
Every chance that I get
When I get the money, I'ma shit on they ass
I'ma trap star, rap star, rockstar, in love with the cash
