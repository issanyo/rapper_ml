[Hook: Soulja Boy]
A hundred thousand dollars ten bands in
I just broke my wrist, whip the whole ten
I just hit the lottery, a hundred mil
I just whipped my wrist, made bout 10 mil
Skurt skurt (x2)
I just broke my wrist, made about ten mil
I just hit the block, worth around ten mil
Skurt skurt (x2)

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Damn, hundred bands and I fuckin' with Carlito
Touch down ten bricks I wrap 'em like burritos
Whippin' with my wrists, I just got a Bentley SUV
Whippin' up a whole key
Skurt skurt (x2)
Catch me in the hood going crazy whippin' yams
Got me going crazy, hundred thousand Instagram
Lil Soulja Boy a hundred million. Damn! Damn!

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
In the trap, whip my wrist, working with the bowl
In the trap, in the kitchen, fuckin' with the stove
Just look at my wrist, I am so diamonds
Shout out to my jeweler, ya he keep me shinin'
Skurt skurt (x2)
Whip my wrist going ham got 'em get 'em gone
Ay! Shout out to the plug, can he put me on?
Pourin' up the lean in my Styrofoam
Money coming in, ringing on my phone
Call me King Soulja, I'm on my throne
We be getting money, do it all alone
Versace on my belt, Burberry cologne

[Verse 3: Lil 100]
I was in the Bentley coupe, I was doing the whole thing
I was in the trap house, trying to whip they Nash
Niggas looking at me, I make it go in
Choppa make them do the fuckin' running man dance
Niggas talking on the low, they talking bout that guap
A hundred thousand, they about fifty blocks
I'm getting money every day, I'm screaming fuck the cops
And SOD the gang, y'all niggas ain't in my lane
I'm switchin lanes up in that Masi fuck the paperazi
I park my car to fuck yo bitch, I hit her in my Masi
My money getting longer, I'm just gone to stunt on y'all
Y'all niggas talking down, I'm just gone ball on y'all
