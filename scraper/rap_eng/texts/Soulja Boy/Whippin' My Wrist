[Intro:]
You gotta chase your dreams man
I'm above the clouds on a private jet
I got all this designer on me (?)

[Hook:]
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Got all these bricks, get it I'm stackin', I'm packin'
Lil Soulja's too rich
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
To get all these bricks, stack it and flip
Lil Soulja too rich

[Verse:]
I'm makin' it rain, yeah I changed the weather
I break it down, put it right back together
Got Louie, Gucci, it's all on my sweater
My niggas winnin' we don't see no contenders
My niggas go hard, my niggas stack millis
I'm swervin', ridin' and I'm drivin' in Bentleys
I'm over in Illi, I'm rockin' it silly
I'm rockin' Fendi and she lookin' like "really?"
Benjis on Benjis while swervin' in Bentleys
We watchin' for the cops, niggas be snitchin'
Got millis on millis, you niggas be silly
We stack it, pack it, stack it up to the ceilin'
I wrap it, package, then I ship it
All of my niggas we get it
All of my niggas we kill it
Catch the case then quit it
Niggas get acquitted, got money cause we got no limits
I'm trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
All of my niggas we swervin' in Phantoms
My diamonds dancin' just like Tony Montana
I take a trip from Brazil to Atlanta
I come out the water, got bricks like a boulder
They comin' in, nigga tell me your order
My niggas get money, I swerve in a foreign
And the coupes with the paint and the spoiler
Valet park that Bugatti, I'm winnin'
My niggas stackin', they got millis on millis
I'm runnin' bands, I'm the man in my city
I'm gettin' money, niggas hatin' like really
I'm gettin' money, niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I'm gettin' mili, I got mili on mili
I stack it, pack it up to the ceilin'
I'm gettin' money, niggas know that I'm killin'
A mili, a mili, I did it, I did it
My niggas stackin', ya my niggas they with it
We stackin' money, we got milis on milis
We swervin', ridin', and we drivin' in Bentleys
My niggas talk and ya my niggas get it
All of you niggas you gotta get it
All of my niggas we got to get it
Used to trap out the bank with 20 pounds of midgets
20 pounds of midget, that's what I'm trappin'
No cappin' had to make my momma happy
I got Louie, Gucci, now they look at me funny
They say Soulja Boy you get all of this money
Them niggas hated cause I'm hot as the sun
Soulja strapped with the automatic gun
Fuckin' the 100s, I don't do the ones
Breakin' bricks down to cookies and crumbs

[Hook:]
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Got all these bricks, get it I'm stackin', I'm packin'
Lil Soulja's too rich
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
To get all these bricks, stack it and flip
Lil Soulja too rich

[Outro:]
I'm the one that they see up
Ice all over me, yup
Hit the bank with some freeze up
You might see me on your street, yup
In the club and the VIP, yup
What you talkin' bout nigga?
