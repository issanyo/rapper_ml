[Chorus: Soulja Boy and Lil B]
I got bitches, I got bitches
Cars, clothes and hoes, the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches, cars clothes and hoes
Stack the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Somebody put me out, goddamb, I'm on fire
I'm with the RA, with the Yokio atire
Whatever I desire, I will obtain
Sayin Soulja Boy ain't got no money, that shit sound deranged
Yeah, it sounds insane
Light my wrist, light up my chain
My haters fallen out the air, cause I bring the major pain
Truth be told, I don't think these hoes can handle me
My swag so anime, eat the cake, Anna May
Keep my third eye open, god protect me from my enomies
They are not no friend to me, nor they are no kin to me
SOD, I cook the game, without no fuckin recipe
Burner murder him just like a felony, I'm heavenly

[Chorus: Soulja Boy and Lil B]
I got bitches, I got bitches
Cars, clothes and hoes, the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches, cars clothes and hoes
Stack the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Man, I got bitches, Base God be swaggin
Word around town he fuck bitches in the Lamb
Pretty boy nigga, with the K , like RM
Gold build nigga, whip your bitch in her ass
Rich young nigga, and I never give a fuck
Last year it didn't, but my Rolli going awol
Rich young nigga, got the cash in the safe, dog
Swag on me like I'm Soulja Boy, with that AR
Greatest artist living, like Juicy J, I stay trippie
Fuck with me, dog, and your girl get that whipping
Shoot like Michael Jordan, and I play like Scotty Pippin
Niggas on my dick, but they know I'm pullin bitches
Get a million dollars, and I got a hundred bitches
Bet you million dollars, and I got 200 bitches
Soulja Boy, tell m, pretty boys, we getting bigger
Brang brang brang, call up a million bitches

[Chorus: Soulja Boy and Lil B]
I got bitches, I got bitches
Cars, clothes and hoes, the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches, cars clothes and hoes
Stack the doe, on some 24s
I got bitches, I got bitches
