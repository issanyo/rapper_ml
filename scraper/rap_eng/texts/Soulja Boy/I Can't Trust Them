[Intro]

[Hook]
I can't trust them
Can't trust them (3x)
I can't trust them
Can't trust them (3x)

[Verse 1]
I can't trust them
Can't trust them
Don't love them
I send bullets
Duck them
I can't trust him
'Cuz he's not family
I can't trust them
'Cuz they're not balling
They're not squad though
They're not blood though
Keep a snub nose
And a shot gun
And a badass bitch riding shot gun
If you disrespect Lil Soulja
I'mma pop some

[Hook 2]
I can't trust them
Can't trust them (3x)
I can't trust them
Can't trust them (3x)
I can't trust them
Can't trust them
Don't love them
I send bullets
Duck them
I can't trust him
Can't trust them (3x)

[Verse 2]
I'm getting money
I'm getting moolah
I be riding through the hood
With my shooter
Homie he'll do ya
Real talk
I live this
Real walk
Step inside the club though
Make it rain money
So much money
You can see I'm stuntin'
Niggas mad at me
Because I ride foreign
Niggas mad at me
'Cuz I'm very important

[Hook 2]
