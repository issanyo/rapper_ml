I whip a maserati
Soulja, king soulja the mixtape, king soulja the movie

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning and I’m headed to a check, bandz
Always gotta count that money when I flex, damn
Wake up in the morning and I’m headed to a check, ok
Counting up the sack, flexin with the check, the check
I’m headed to a check, a check, I’m headed to a check
I’m headed to a check, a check, I’m headed to a check
I’m headed to a check, a check, I’m headed to a check
On the way to a check, hey

[Verse 1]
Rich gang soulja bandz in my pocket, pocket
9 millimeter nigga I’m shooting little rockets
Pull up to the car show, I’m springing I got spring
Little dre gonn ball in that song everything
Walk up in the gatti, whip a maserati
Porsche game clean, but my whip game sloppy
Money game retarded, bitch don’t get me started
Sat on the challenger, I swear I bought from college
Soulja boy I ball, riding down that highway
Got the drop top maybach, sitting in the driveway
Hit the secret Sundays, balling till there’s Monday
Flexin so hard, soulja boy be guappin, yo, guap
Pull up to the truck, bitch I got blocks
Bitch I got knots, Gucci on my socks

Swerving in that foreign Porsche off to Hollywood
Hoppin out the in and out I’m smoking on this kush
Call me soulja bizzy b or call me rich gang soulja boy
Soulja boy, bricks on bricks that’s what I soulja boy
Riding through the hood, everything all good
2 15 in my trunk, sounding like Jurassic park
Riding through my city bitch don’t come through here and start
Sod get money I will tear your life apart

Hop about the private plane, I’m smoking on that mary jane
3 65 o like hurricane, soulja boy spit fire

[Hook]
