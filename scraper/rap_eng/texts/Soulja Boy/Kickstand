[Intro]
S.O.D (420)

[Chorus]
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand (Soulja)
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand (Scream)
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand (Izzo)
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand

[Verse 1]
Pop one, pop two, I'm outta here I'm outta here
S.O.D crew, we outta here we outta here
Money out the roof, the Maserati coupe
Got me flexin' down the highway
Everybody know I got the Phantom in the driveway
Double cue 30 ice ain't nun but that motherfuckin' sprite in my double cup
Everywhere I go I'm throwin' money, yeah
Juice Mixtape got the streets on fire
I'ma keep sending shots till these old niggas retire, Lil Dre

[Chorus]
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand

[Verse 2]
Yeah you already know
Tony on that kickstand
Tryna find out how much sweet a nigga will stand
Bitch, you know I got that money sorta like Uncle Sam
Might as well get high, pop a couple Rozan
Say you wanna smoke, I have that kush rolled in right instant
And you already know that's a old fragrance
Yellow diamonds have all these bitches staring
Yeah I'm so first they think the nigga is arrogant
These flashy flashy waves, man that shit is apparent

[Chorus]
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand
Kickstand, kickstand
All my niggas in the club on that kickstand, kickstand

[Verse 3]
You niggas thought it was over but I'm not finished
Fall in the club bitch fuckin' up a ticket
Blowin' on dat loud pat, we don't smoke no midgets
Drop top Maserati and yo bitch is in it
And the window tinted and I'm sippin' kickstand
Never gave a fuck 'cuz I'm throwin' big bands
Me and Tony yo that's that simp set connect
Got that YGRN so you better show respect
Man you know I'm in your town fuckin' up a check
I throw the bands in this bitch and I'ma cut that check
And when it time for the beef, bitch, I'ma grip that tec
Nigga know I'm showin off, you know I'm gon splash
Got the juice in the booth with my nigga countin' cash
Calico Jonez, money gang fam
I can't forget my nigga killa kam
We still throwin' bands, the lamb between the man
I've been posted up so heavy on that fuckin kickstand
Dre be my name but you can call me Lil' Soulja
Been throwin' these racks, boy, I thought that I told ya
Back in Panolla, ride in that drop
Had the lambo doors up, man, this shit do not stop
