Man these haters always mad at me man, why they mad?
Cause I'm eating?
Watch me get 'em

[Hook: H Da Kid]
These haters mad cause I'm getting cheese
You ain't my friend, bitch nigga please(2x)
Nope, nope, nope, nope, hah?(2x)

[Verse 1: H Da Kid]
I'm riding around my city, with a bad chick like Whitney
Killing shit like 50, nine bullets to the body and I still haven't dropped
I'm balling non stop, and if you hating suck a cock
I'm busting like that Glock
Nasty nigga, I'm on my own, stacking papers now I'm feeling grown, chasing after my dreams and I want the fucking throne
I'm Gone, to a better place where I paper chase, they talking shit, but not in your face, talking shit like they ain't real
I grind hard you stand still, still waiting on my deal, cause competition I already kill and that's real
So keep it straight I'm getting cake, circle small ain't no fakes, circle small cause their snakes, watch when I drop my mixtape cause the game's over
Killing these niggas and I'm never sober, shorty loves me like she loves fucking sosa, hah?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sam]
Do you see this?, I'm bleeding gold
[?]
Damn right this cold, man in the city I'm grown
Bow to the notion, game turning kosher, I'm on that flow shit
Move to the motion, rap for commotion, talking back [?], live for the moment
Capping choices, [?], got them bands on lock, shooters watch the spot, bands on the shit and now I'm better
Any less so don't settle deserve so we tell 'em, lead the case like a felon
What's on my mind, I lay it down, pay for sound, getting paid for loud, when you come from you ain't aloud, this game arousing, can't get around it
Those lines you don't cross em, got a roar like Mufasa
They look for causes, but its bout the product, when you pump the shotgun, don't front to boxing, I'm walking they flocking, they shooting flames but they caught it
