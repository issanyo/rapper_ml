On the scene smoking that purple
The shawty see me on the highway driving in that brand new bentley
Swagged up turned up
Turned up season swagged up century
Little dre that be my name
But you can call me soulja
SOD thats on my chain

We cashed up and you lemonade
Six girls in the room

Cashed up every day

Riding down the high way and i’m slipping slipping slipping
Slurping swerving everybody

Because you miss you wanna slurp me
She just suck me never jerk me
Call me baby like she birth me
It’s amazing how she do it call her friend and then they chew it
In my straw that’s how they do it
They just swallow all my fluids
