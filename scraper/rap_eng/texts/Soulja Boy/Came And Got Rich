Fast and furious on your bitch

Ridin' round, twenty gauge

Killin' the plan when I whip the cake
Gettin' that money and fuckin' the money up everyday
Fuckin' it up like it's real estate

Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain

Hopped up out the bed
Turned my swag on
Took a look in the mirror
Said "What's up"
Yeah
