A hundred and fifty bricks sitting on the jet
Got a bad bitch she giving me neck
Ripping that beverage I'll go nigga leaving you wet

Twenty two hundred for the P but you gotta get ten
Young nigga jumping out the gym
Forgiatos on my rims
Back in the trapping I'm whippin' that pack once again

[Verse 1]
Back in the trap and I'm pouring out lean
Broke nigga you ain't never seen a key
All of these shooters surrounding me
Pinky ring cost twenty Gâ€™s

Whipping the trap with my wrist with the back of some hundred fifty
They want that nigga place your order
Shooter pull up on yo block my nigga they'll take it from him

Ripping that beverage I'll go nigga leaving you wet

Young nigga jumping out the gym
Forgiatos on my rims
