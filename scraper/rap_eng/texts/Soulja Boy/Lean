I lean (watch me, watch me hey hey)
I lean watch me do it. I Lean (Soulja Boy Tell Em)
She like the way I lean, so I had to do it
Shawty she so fine, man my game is stupid. (stupid, stupid)
Dj run the music, I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it. (lose it, lose it.)
She's about to lose it
Shawty she so fine, man my game is stupid. (stupid, stupid)
Dj run the music, I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it. (lose it, lose it.)

Got Her nickname on a her necklace, that's a go
I love the way her polish, make her nails look like they glow
I can tell she fly, when she ain't got nowhere to go
She keep that hair and make up like she starring in a show
Wanna see what she go on, This a party though
We getting turn't up on the floor.
She wanna at me on the low
Too bad pretty girls don't dance no more
When im on girl, say gon' girl
I now she would be rollin' rollin' rollin'

Lookin' so sexy, always on my mind
Shawty so turn't up, turn around and drop it
I wanna see you move it, turn around and pop it

[Verse]
B-b- baby put her technique on display
She do it like she practice in the mirror everyday
You know she start to feel it, when she flip away her bangs
All the girls giggles but the hommies be like dang
Run it back one more time, that's wassup
Talk real talk, now back it up
Rep yo city, give it up
Lights off, lights on, we switchin' up
Bounce to the left side, then to the right side
She drop it then she roll it, roll it, roll it

[Soulja Boy]
Shawty you so cool, she know what to do
Baby girl said ,she got a thing for young dudes
Notice that I stay with brand new chains and brand new shoes
Snapback, white tee, and an ipad
She like the way I lean, baby girl you bad

Baby girl you so hot, welcome to the crew
I like the way you move, I like the way you pop it
So you should keep on goin' ,and girl you shouldn't stop it
