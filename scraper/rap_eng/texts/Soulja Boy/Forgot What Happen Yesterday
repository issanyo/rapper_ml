[Intro]
All this money dripping on me
You already know I’m blessed
S-beezy
No matter how I look at it I came from the bottom
I had to struggle

[Hook]
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I went and bought a Audi Coupe just the other day
My savages they crazy, shot a nigga just the other day
And I get money I wouldn't have it any other way
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I went and bought a brand new Porsche just the other day
My savages going crazy the other day
I’m getting to the money I wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 1]
Hey yea
Yeah you know I’m getting cake
I get money real estate
And these niggers so fake
I smoked a pound of this weed just the other day
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
My niggas in the streets they shot 'em just the other day
I’m getting money I wouldn't have it any other way
Any other way have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I popped a zan I forgot what happen yesterday
I bought a brand new Porsche just the other day
Hop in the money and splash, all of my niggers get cash
Hop in the Bentley then splash [?] my cash
Balenciaga on my feet 30 on me keep the heat
We chillin' on south beach we go watch the heat
Soulja get money leather [?] on me
Niggas talkin' but these niggas [?] on me
I get money and I'm getting into it
Niggers talking then the choppers'll hit 'em
Niggers talking all the money I did it
All of the bars of the xanax we get 'em
All of the xannies we get 'em we chew on the xannies
Like Skittles I’m up in the middle

[Hook]
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I just bought a brand new porsche just the other day
My savages they goin' crazy the other day
I'm getting to the money I wouldn’t have it any other way
Any other way, just the other day
My savages they shot a nigga just the other day
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
All that I know: We gonna spend this cash

[Verse 2]
I got the Porsche designed I got my Bentley [?]
And my [?] on rewind
Forgiatos on my rims
Lui V’s on my tims
HD on my films
You know that I'm
You know that I get it you know that I got it
It's not a problem
Shawty she fucking with me, shawty she fucking with me

I’m riding that [?] to the streets
Yeah I get cool on the beat
We chillin on the beach
We chill on the beach

[Hook]
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I just bought a brand new porsche just the other day
My savages they goin' crazy the other day
I'm getting to the money I wouldn’t have it any other way
