[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I blow bands, I blow bands

[Verse 1]
I'm the man, I'm the man, my whole team blow bands
Blow bands, yeah, blow bands
I'm the man, I'm the man, I be rolling off them Xan's (off the Xan's)
I be rolling off them Xan's, I'm the man

[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, go, go, go, I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I cashed out this year (cash out)
The top on my car, it just disappeared (poof)
My engine sittin' in the rear (zoom)
If you ain't getting cash, fuck up outta here (go)
Young Soulja, this my year (what?)
Candy-paint the Range Rover and the (?)
Two chains got me feeling great
Hoppin' out the foreign whip to a new estate (damn)
My ring looking icy now
I'm hoppin' out the whip, they screamin Soulja on
Those bricks touch down, then they gone
If you need a verse nigga, hit me on my phone
They know that I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, blowing it like a fan
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm blowing kush, sippin' lean, rolling off them Xan's

[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, rolling off them Xan's
I'm the man, I'm the man (turn up)
I'm the man, I'm the man (x3)

[Verse 3]
Red bottom walking, I'm the man (red bottom)
Up inside the versace store, a whole lotta bag
A whole lotta Gucci (?) on the tag (damn)
Nigga need rags, you can add it to my tab
Rolling off of poper and she on the lower tap
Hoppin' out the foreign, you know Soulja get cash
I splash, in my whip there's dizzy da dash (x2)
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm blowing bands
Just like a copper
I'm in the club and my brother brought the chopper
I'm rolling off of bean, and a yopper
A yopper
I'm the man
