[Chorus]
Trappin' and cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came on trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I'm walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' on cappin' on whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I came on trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I'm walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the pyrex, I whip the pot

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the trap had  money in my face
Trappin' n cappin' you know  switching from state to state
Bro, mansion in Condo I switch up the low case
100 thousand cash just for motivation
Jumped out the Wraith, then I hop in the i8
Egg beater , hit the pot like I beat the case
Pull out the pistol, I shot the K'
Money get shooter and they poppin' shit bright  day
Made an M, I just made it today
Came up from trappin' n cappin'
Ate it everything on the plane
Smokin' on rocks, now I'm high in space
Call up my lawyer, you know he gon' beat the case
Get the draco, then we shoot with the 38
Grippin' and rack at out, I know that these niggas fake
Ferragamo on me, rock in the Gucci snakes
Pull out the draco, get shot in the face

[Chorus]
Trappin' and cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came on trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I'm walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' on cappin' on whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I come from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I'm walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the pyrex, I whip the pot


[Verse 2]
Big Soulja, I'm the  big homie
Mini  draco, gotta keep it on me
I came up from trappin' n cappin' and yeah they act like they  know me
Put the bricks in the finger fold
I stand at your front door, ski mask with a draco
Who wanna bih' homie, shoot when I say so
Came up from trappin' n cappin' for pesos
150 bricks down Sandiego
2018, bently truck Forgiato
Trappin' n cappin' M's in wells fargo
Bricks coming in, scrapin' 'bout a brought hoe
Trappin' on cappin' on smokin' gelato
100 pounds, nigga hit the lotto
Givenchy on me, I'm flyin' Aeropostale
Flip it like Future, this shit get collapso
Hop in the Lamborghini, full throttle

[Chorus]
