[Hook]
Jock my stance, jock my stance, jock my stance, throwing bands
When I fall off in the club, Smook dog, Smook dog, yeah man, make it rain
Jock my stance, jock my stance, jock my stance, throwing bands
When I fall off in the club, Smook dog, Smook dog, yeah man, make it rain

[Verse 1]
Bruh, what it do? Drop-top red billy coupe, I done
Killed the insides and took off the roof, I done
Hit the block and shown them boys I'm the truth, then I
Hit the club, made it rain out the booth, with a
Hundred racks out the motherfucking booth, then I
Called up SOD, told them come bring the crew, with a
Long bottle we gon pop in the club, then we
Hit the next club and made the strip club blow up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got love for my people that got love for me
Riding through these streets, SODMG till the day that I RIP
Tell them boys that I be so icy
When I step inside the club they try to get just like me
From the white tee to the Nike to the white Excursion
To the orange Lamborghini Donnerville[?], you heard me
And I'm switching lanes, maintaining, everyday smoking purp
I tell them, I tell them that I'm getting money, you heard me? Jock my stance

[Hook]
