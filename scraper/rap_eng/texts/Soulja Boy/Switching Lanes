[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Lambo chain ridin' fire flame
King Johnny, I ain't fucking Johnny Dang
When I'm in the Rari, yeah, I'm switching lanes
I might do the Ali, I might ride foreign things
And I'm switching lanes, and I'm switching lanes
Catch me in a Rari, Lambo on my chain
Hop up in a Rari and I'm switching lanes

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Lambo on my chain, Lambo switchin' lanes
I just copped a brand new pinky rinky
300 thousand on outer space
I just called my lawyer, yeah, he beat the case
I just made a thousand on the east end
I just got my killers and they killin'
For the Soulja, they rollin'
I put 100 thousand in a old band
Put 200 thousand, I steer up through the city
I was on the stage dancing like I was Diddy
300 thousand that for my commodity
My team we ready, my team we down

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Lambo chain ridin' fire flame
King Johny, I ain't fucking Johnny Dang
When I'm in the Rari, yeah, I'm switching lanes
I might do the Ali, I might ride foreign things
And I'm switching lanes, and I'm switching lanes
Catch me in a Rari, Lambo on my chain
Hop up in a Rari and I'm switching lanes

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I hopped out the whip like I was on vacay
I just hit the stage and they hit the nae nae
30 thousand dollars on a brand new chain
50 thousand dollars on a brand new Range
I just copped a condo with Fendi chandelier
I just took off the plant and I'm out of here
I just switched the Lambo in the sixth gear
They say Soulja Boy you got 30 carrots a year
I flex up on these haters yeah I flex the lanes
Whippin' in the kitchen cooking in the pan
Just look at my pockets see a lot of gwuap
Soulja Boy a tell em it will never stop

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Lambo chain ridin' fire flame
King Johny, I ain't fucking Johnny Dang
When I'm in the Rari, yeah, I'm switching lanes
I might do the Ali, I might ride foreign things
And I'm switching lanes, and I'm switching lanes
Catch me in a Rari, Lambo on my chain
Hop up in a Rari and I'm switching lanes
