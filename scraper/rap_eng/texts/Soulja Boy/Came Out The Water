Came out the water and you know I'm swaggin
Got a couple goons bitch down to make it happen
Pistol pop body drop every day is action
Hundred thousand jeans and you know them bitches saggin
Tell me what is Hannin looking for the action
Every mixtape that I drop going platinum
S.O.D Gang gang gang gang on your main Bitch
Lay her on that mattress then i blow her back bitch
AK 47 make your ass do a backflip
Hatin on my squad I can't have that hallow tips
Rip through your skin bitch, hit you in your chin bitch
Young Soulja Boy, I'mma boss til' the end shit

Came out the water swag cross the border
Black girl white girl gone take your order
If you ain't talking money then it's not important
I'm so important very important
Came out the water, swag cross the border
Black girl white girl gone take your order
If you ain't talking money then it's not important
I'm so important came out the water

I swag just like Sammy, bitch I need a Grammy
Just bought a new mansion down in Miami
Oh I'm so handsome poppin out the Phantom
Yellow diamond shawty and I'm racked up I'm getting in
'Lil Dre a.k.a Soulja boy tell em
Came out the water like a six time felon
Hoes on me heavy cause I look like a Prophet
Pretty boy gangsta, ugly bitch stop it
Cope riding round with that missile just to rock it
Disrespect my clique then bitch I'll have to pop it
Looking for the rap game pussy boy I got it
Locked it, AKA 47 in the cockpit
Gone cross the water, I walk like I'm Jesus
It's yellow diamond Beezy made that shit look easy
Niggas living wrong but my life is so perfect
Goddamn it's worth it, S.O.D on Jersey
