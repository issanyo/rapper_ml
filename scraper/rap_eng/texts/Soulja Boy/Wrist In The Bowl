I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
(I got my wrist in the bowl)
I came up from trappin' and servin' 'em things
Now I'm covered in gold
I got my wrist in the bowl
Standin' and servin' the zones
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
(I got my wrist in the bowl)
I came up from trappin' and servin' 'em things
Now I'm covered in gold
I got my wrist in the bowl
Standin' and servin' the zones

[Verse 1]
Standin' and servin' I'm trappin' on cascade
Got 'em shooters they pull up and they shootin' in broad day
Trappin' cappin' in the hallway
Standin' in zone 1 man I'm servin' crack all day
Ain't no days off, I'm trappin' on sunday
Put my wrist in the bowl, nigga don't want gunplay
Mini draco on me that way
Matte black Bentley, same color Dikembe
Stadnin' in kitchen I'm whippin' that Whitney
Baking soda hit the pot, take a pig out to Italy
Rappers swagger jackers, takin' my energy
Mini draco on me that's for my enemies
Broke ass niggas really ain't shit to me
5 gram backwoods, ain't smokin' no swisher sweet
Spark up that lotto, I'm sippin' promethazine
Draco bullet burn just like a histamine
Put that .30 in your mouth just like listerine
Take gold rose so my neck gold just like Mr. T
5 pints of Actavis with some Hennessy
Spray with the draco, nigga ain't no miss to me

I got my wrist in the bowl

I came up from trappin' and servin' 'em things
Now I'm covered in gold
I got my wrist in the bowl
Standin' and servin' the zones
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
I got my wrist in the bowl
(I got my wrist in the bowl)
I came up from trappin' and servin' 'em things
Now I'm covered in gold
I got my wrist in the bowl
Standin' and servin' the zones

[Verse 2]
I came up from trappin', cappin', now I'm famous
My shooters grippin' that stainless
That draco will leave a nigga stankin'
Nigga what the fuck you thinkin'?
Actavis on me you know what I'm drankin'
Servin' cocaine like a damn patient
Got that draco nigga ain't no .380
I came up from trappin' and servin' up babies
10 kilos like it's the 80s
Hit for 3 Ms now I know that they hatin'
Bang with the choppa nigga what you sayin'?
Bang for the gang, nigga you crazy
Run up on gang, nigga you crazy
Shooters they pull up hop out the Mercedes
Giuseppes my feet, ain't no LRG baby
The trap hear my phone blowin' up, know they waitin'
They said lil soulja got the streets goin' crazy
They say Big Soulja put a hit on your neighbor
Grippin' the draco, I'm eatin' alfredo
Blit! blit!
Talk to the plug down in Mexico
