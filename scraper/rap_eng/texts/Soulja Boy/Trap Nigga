[Chorus:]
Young trap nigga turn 25
Young trap nigga turn 25
Young trap nigga trap nigga [x4]
Young trap nigga turn 25 [x2]
Young trap nigga trap nigga [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Am so piped up I’m so turnt up
I got so much sauce
I feel like a book dropping top
I got bitches on me in a car bitches on the bus
Nigga they can’t fuck with us trap you got to know
All back again all back again like i never love
I just want a pitch i just want to know
Hopped out the rari can't help myself
I just be leaning and killing them
Killing them killing them whipping them
With my diamond and they shining
Niggers they hating because my seats they be reclining
You know it is your boy you know how we do
You know what we do if any money come in at all
It's all in my schedule better things to do
Get out the truck nigga worth 25 in the trap

[Chorus:]
In the trap nigga worth 25
Young trap nigga trap nigga [x4]
Young trap nigga worth 25 [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I’m fucking the girls of my dream face on the front of a magazine
I stepped out the rari i never say sorry
They looking at my rari like jeez
The grills at the front they so sweet
I wish i can go backwards
I turn over the old hood we whipping in the holly wood
We in the fucking hood you know we got to get this green
I never wanted to cause no scene
Nigga you caught in your sleep
Niggers they snitching on me

[Chorus]
Young trap nigga worth 25 [x2]
Young trap nigga trap nigga [x4]
Young trap nigga worth 25 [x2]
Young trap nigga trap nigga [x4]

[Outro:]
I said young young young young young
I said young young young young oh
Trap nigga trap nigga [x2]
