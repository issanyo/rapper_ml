[Hook]
Finessing the plug a young nigga pouring the lean
Count a hundred thousand in one day nigga it feel like a dream
I'm a young rich nigga pull up with xan in the lean
All of this money on me I feel like I'm in a dream
Finessing the plug a nigga pouring the lean
Pull up with the shooters they hop out squeezing the heat
All of this money on me know I got xan with the lean
I counted up a hundred thousand feel like I'm in a dream
Like I'm in a dream
I feel like I'm in a dream
I'm in a dream
I feel like I'm in a dream
I count a hundred thousand man I'm feeling like I'm in a dream
I count a hundred thousand in one day nigga not a week

[Verse 1]
All of my niggas they serving
All of my niggsa they swerving
Hop out the Rari and Porsche truck
Shooters riding in excursion
All of my niggas they packing
Nigga I'm serving that crack
Bitch I'm pouring up hi tek and I'm pouring up Ak
The soldiers I move like a mobster
My niggas be gripping them choppers
You ain't no trapper nigga you impostor
Pull up on yo block with that chopper and pop ya
You ain't bullet proof that chopper gone stop ya
Standing the kitchen I'm whippin' Tilapia
I got the Pâ€™s yeah the bricks yeah a lot of that
Niggas be snitching talking to the coppers
Pull in that ghost phantom of the opera
Serving percocets like I'm a doctor
Real street nigga can't snitch on my partners
Young nigga took her like a helicopter
Standing the kitchen I whip up a four
Standing the kitchen and fuck up the store
All of my niggas be whippin' the bowl
All of my young niggas travel the globe

[Bridge]
Rich nigga swag out the bowl
Imma go pour up a four
Fuck on your ho
Mansion came with marble floor
Solja got bricks they under the floor
You already know
Serving that for the low
Everything must go
Soulja got blow
Dope music good music whipping the motherfucking dough

[Hook]
Finessing the plug a young nigga pouring the lean
Count a hundred thousand in one day nigga it feel like a dream

All of this money on me I feel like I'm in a dream
Finessing the plug a nigga be pouring the lean
Pull up with the shooters they hop out squeezing the heat
All of this money on me know I got xan with the lean
I counted up a hundred thousand feel like I'm in a dream
