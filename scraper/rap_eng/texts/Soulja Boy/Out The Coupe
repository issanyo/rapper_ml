[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Out the coupe
Wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet
Birds in the zoo
I'm in love with Chanel
I like Louis, too
Pull up in a Porsche
I'm like "ooh", baby, who is you?
Out the coupe
Wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet
Birds in the zoo
I'm in love with Chanel
I like Louis, too
Pull up in a Porsche
I'm like "ooh", baby, who is you?

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I'm dripped in Off-White (yuh)
Count money all night
Got bitches, different types (huh)
I mix lean with Sprite
Bitches in bikinis (huh)
Pull up in a beamer
Pull up, Lamborghini (I skrrt, skrrt)
It's two seater
Left wrist Aquafina (I whip, whip, whip)
Left wrist, eggbeater
Pull up in the whip (drop-top)
And I got my heater
Word around town (skrrt, skrrt)
I got bricks and pounds
Word around the city (blaow, boom)
Got a hundred rounds
I just put my wrist out the coupe (I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
In a fast lane, birds out the zoo
If a nigga play with gang (blaow, boom, boom)
Grab that yop, we shoot
Bust down my rollie
Everything on me new (ooh)
