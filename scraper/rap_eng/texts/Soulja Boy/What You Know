[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]

I'm easily rippin defensively grippin
My pistol you niggas play tough but don't want it
I'm poppin and cockin and lockin da game
2 zone for da free so I'm off of da chain
Double O see murder murder im urgess
Then kick in yo door wit da ma'fuckin pistol
I'm comin ta get you we bustin no issue
White walls on da rental same color as tissue
No kissin me missin me yo funeral dissin me
Daz a mistake so you betta not try it
I'm startin a riot 2 fly like a pilot
Took off da jet witout breakin no sweat
Niggas be fakin and steady be haytin
I'm breakin dey jaws juss like we dew laws
And triple da digits juss like we dew inches
Da money keep comin and so dew da bitches
And so dew da snitches and riches and glitches
Juss like it's game I'm too hot like a flame
Ain't sayin no names cuz you kno you are
Bustin no fussin we spotted yo car
Cruisin no losin and rollin dat betta dope
400m's and I got from interscope
Betta dew right cuz I'm colder den Coolio
Rippin dis up while I'm up in da studio
Movin so heavily slidin so steadily
Crew stackin figures you know it's a bet
Tha money is money let dummies be dummies
So I'm stackin dis bread till da day dat I'm dead
Dey swear dat dey robbin me bruh ain't no stoppin me
Hustle philosophy got me dis guap
S.O.D. Money Gang brangin dat heavy flame
Puttin it on GOD we stayin on top

[Hook: JBar]

Now what cha-what cha know bout my flow and my icy-icy gold
28's on swole, music loud as it can go
Now what cha-what cha know bout my shine and my struggle and my grind
I work hard ta get mine man respect a nigga grind
Now what cha-what cha know bout my flow and my icy-icy gold
28's on swole, music loud as it can go
Now what cha-what cha know bout my shine and my struggle and my grind
I work hard ta get mine man respect a nigga grind

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]

Rippin and spittin and cruisin dis beat
Talkin dat shit and get knocked off yo feet
S.O.D. Money Gang stayin too deep
Gettin no sleep makin a creep
Double vendetta my crew stackin cheddar
My click gettin betta we changin da weather
Tha pedal ta medal and ashes ta da dust
Two 4 Glocks in pot when I hop in da truck
Niggas iz haytin me but it ain't phasin me
Money money money money money gottta get it
But it ain't stoppin my Glock and I'm cockin it
Get it get it get it get it get it hot by da minute
Soulja Boy Tellem I'm all about cheddar folk
Icey new chevy same color as a antelope
Sick as a bitch and I'm holdin da antidote
Gucci bandana man gucci bandana folk
Rushin and bustin still flippin and dippin
I'm still on a mission ta stack up a bill
Money make problems ain't none gon' solve em
But I'm breakin dis bread and payin deez bills
Spittin da truth vocalizin it truthly
6 in da truck but I'm still gon' pack 2 wit me
Killin deez tracks and I'm dew'n it ruthlessly
If it ain't about money ain't got shit ta dew wit me
Dew'n it fluently dew'n it real
Keepin it true when I'm keepin it trill
Breakin off game cuz daz how I feel
18 now holdin 18 mill
Killin deez trax and I'm still countin stax
And I'm still dressed in black haytaz still talkin smack
Soulja Boy Tellem yea Soulja Boy get em
On top of da world and don't know how ta act
