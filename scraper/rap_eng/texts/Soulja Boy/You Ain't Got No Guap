Shoutout to my niggas on the block
Broke nigga you ain't got no guap (x2)
Broke ass nigga you need to stop
I'm swerving Lamborghini's off the lot
Robbin Jeans filled with all the guap
Broke boi you ain't get no guap
Broke boi you ain't get no guap

(verse)
Broke boi you ain't got no guap
I done fucked your bitch she a thot
I just took a trip with your girlfriend
She done suck my dick in a new benz
She done fuck me and told all her friends
