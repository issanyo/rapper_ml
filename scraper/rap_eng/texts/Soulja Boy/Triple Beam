On my little brother grave
Pull on your block spraying with the K
I got car that you never seen
Young nigga with a triple beam
Triple beam (x2)
Young nigga with a triple beam
Triple beam (x2)
Young nigga with a triple beam

[Verse: Soulja boy]
On my little brother grave, pull up on your block spraying with the K
How I get the guap? It's a mystery, disrespect my squad I'm a leave you history
Trapping and capping and ripping and flipping my niggas they stealing
4.40 aim from the K
Pull up on your block, know I'm getting money I put in your face
I reach in my pockets and see all my Franklin's
Walk in the mall Versace my draws, and all of the girls they fainting man
Pull up to the club in a car you never seen
I was 16 with a triple beam
50k stuffed inside my Robin Jeans
Took a whole half and broke it down with my team

[Hook]
On my little brother grave
Pull on your block spraying with the K
I got car that you never seen
Young nigga with a triple beam
Triple beam (x2)
Young nigga with a triple beam
Triple beam (x2)
Young nigga with a triple beam

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I don't wanna talk, pull up in that Bentley I ain't trying walk
Pull up in that Bentley then get on a yacht
Then I go up on a cruise with a Thot
Smoking kush breaking bands by the block
Swerving foregin whips off the lot
Panorama Porsche that's alot
Audemar piguet , I’m gettin’ guap
Pull up and I got that drink
Riding through the city and I'm in a tank
Smoking kush walking in the bank
We getting money and you niggas ain't

[Hook]
