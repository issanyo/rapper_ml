[Intro]
You know what's going on
Lean

[Hook x2]
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold

[Verse 1]
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
Send it at all of my shows
Ten pounds on the low
I got them feel like [?]
Pull up I'm flexing in Rari
Nigga I never say sorry
Snapped by the paparazzi
Put versace on my body
Who sipping [Jah Vinci Jah Vonce?]
Who sipping [Jah Vinci Jah Vonce?]
I come to the trap with banana clips
I let them pull up at you monkeys
You know I've been getting the money
You know that my jewels stay cold
Yeah I be coming and go
Fifty thousand for a show

[Hook x2]
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold

[Verse 2]
Your bitch yeah she on me a lot
Maserati off the lot
Bandanna like I'm 2Pac
Running down town with two Glocks
Caught me one hundred shots
Stacking all under my gwop
Might have to check on the gwop
Fifty thousand boy I'm hot
In the hood I'm in the Lam
Stacking up cash fast as I can
[?] get to the money I am
Let me get it, black that man
Pouring the lean mix the zan
Yeah yeah you know I'm the man
Your baby momma know I'm the man
Twenty thou', million rolls in my pocket

[Hook x2]
Fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I fuck up the pot with the bowl
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold
I just want diamonds and gold

[Outro]
Woah
