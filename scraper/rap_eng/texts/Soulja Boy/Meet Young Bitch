[Chorus: Lil B]
Meet young bitch, I surv her on the dick
She comes my way, and I flip her like bricks
Yeah, meet young bitch, I surv her on the dick
She comes my way, and I flip her like bricks

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Imma fuck her, then I ram her

Imma fuck her in her mouth, and fuck her in the ass
Imma fuck her in her face, then I go back and smoke gass
Don't be mad, I'm ridin with yo bitch, bruh
