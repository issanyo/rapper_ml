[Hook]
Pull up with my top down
Niggas get mad because I'm hot now
She ain't used to want me now she bop now
I make this bitch pop now
[2x]

[Verse 1]
Pull up with my top off
10 chains on my neck I am a young boss
Bad bitch know I am taking off
Catch me in that foreign whip and I am racing off
I'm in the club buying hella bottles
Me and my crew up in the club fucking all the models
And niggas mad cause I blowed up
I'm in the hood and my niggas yeah we pulled up
I'm on the block and I'm going fast
Everybody know that Soulja keep a lot of cash
Bad bitch on me, almost crashed
I got so much money, so much swag
Ten chains and some tattoos
Get your baby mama and I fuck her in the bathroom
A young nigga on the [?]
Soulja Montanas 2014 my own rules
I pull up with my top down
And all the fuck niggas mad because I hot now
Disrespect Soulja and I shoot the whole block down
I'm on the block with a whole damn fucking pound
A hundred rounds in the back of the backseat
Niggas get to shooting, start running like a track meet
I'm getting money and you ain't even got to ask me
I'm gettin money like that nigga from degrassi

[Hook]
Pull up with my top down
Niggas get mad because I'm hot now
She ain't used to want me now she bop now
I make this bitch pop now
