[Hook]
You know I'm fresh when I walk in the mall
Step on the stove, you know I'm a boss
When I go shop, then I wanted all
When I hit the band, turn up on ya
I get the band, then turn on ya
When I get bands, turn up on ya
When I hit the band, I turn up on ya
You know I'm so fresh when I walk in the mall
Step on the stove, you know I'm a boss
When I go shop, then I want it all
When I get the band, gon' turn up on ya
When I get bands, then turn on ya, I turn up on ya
When I get bands, then turn up on ya, turn up on ya

[Verse 1]
You know I'm so fresh when I walk in the mall
Step on the 'Rari, you know I'm a boss
Enter the money, you know I'm a boss
The girl I loved
