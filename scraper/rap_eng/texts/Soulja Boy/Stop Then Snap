Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, Soulja Boy Tell'Em

[Bridge x8]
Do the motorcycle, snap

[Verse 1]

Me and my folk
Buddy talking crazy but he just don't know
Go deep in the building and we screaming out we here
Soulja Boy ain't got no money?
Shit, get them outta here
Unsigned hype, I'm on top of the charts
Charts hit the finish line before a player even start
Still on the scene, still holding green
And you know we can meet if your boy disagree

Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, Soulja Boy Tell'Em

[Bridge x8]
Do the motorcycle, snap

[Verse 2]
I got eyes in the streets so I know who be talking
Half of the nights Soulja Boy sleep walking
Patrone but I'm grown so I stay on that ex
I stay with a black fitted cap on my head
I'm always riding always surprising
Summer time hit and I'm going to that island
I'm just grinding it's me being me
Don't get served but you heard in the streets

Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, Soulja Boy Tell'Em

[Bridge x8]
Do the motorcycle, snap

[Verse 3]
I got money on my mind
Mind on my money
I see these lames laughing but it ain't nothing funny
I'm getting out the work tryna stash six-o
They know who I be cause my name on my clothes
Hat to the back already on my stand
Hit the dance floor, Soulja Boy gon' do the dance
First you snap then wiggle then rock
Crank the motorcycle then ho ho stop

[Hook]
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, then wiggle with it, snap
Stop, snap, Soulja Boy Tell'Em
