Drako!

[Verse]
Pop out with draco, run up the pesos
Pint by the bottle, they callin' my Chapo
I ride the Lambo like I hit the lotto
I'm smokin' cookies and sellin' gelato
I know that most of these niggas be fake
Pussy ass nigga get hit with the K
I'm gettin' money, the fuck out my face
I walk in the trap and I pour up a eight
I catch a quarter million Bentley truck
Whippin' my wrist in the pot, I don't give a fuck
Wish a nigga well, gotta go double up
Left wrist Rolex, sixty thousand for my shit it's frozen up
Red beam on their head, I'ma hit em up
Drop yo location, nigga let's go get it up
Bust down on a bracelet
Fifty thousand for my jeweler, spent it, I ain't give no fuck
Young Drako nigga, you know I'm real nigga
Young Drako nigga you know I be trappin', my nigga
Young Drako run through the millions
Young Drako stack up money to the ceiling, my nigga
Had to go get a ticket
Most of these niggas be really bitches
Twin-Turbo when I skrrt this shit too the limit
Catch me in the trap, nigga I'm whippin' fishes
Okay, but that's another story, back to this trap shit
In the trenches, put a hundred thousand in my mattress
Fuck with Drako, bitch you know I'm bout action
Make the wrong move, then my nigga start clappin'
You want a pint of drink, you know that I tax you
I'm the CEO of Money Gang, and nigga we blastin'
Hop in the Rari, and skrrt in that Aston
White Maserati, same color as Casper
Jump in the foreign, you know it go faster
A hundred bitches on my P, just like Master
Brand new Rari, man I don't do the masda
Ooh I meant Mazda, ooh I'm eatin' lobsters
Hundred dollar Gucci shirt, I pop collar
Thousand dollar gold bottle, I pop it
Big draco on me, I don't gotta cock it
I put a hundred bricks in helicopters
This shit ain't got no hook, but I'm steady goin'
Stand in that trap, and I'm makin' it storm
Tornado whip my wrist, I fuck up my arm
Two-tone Cuban link, I switch up the charm
I walk in that club, and they ring an alarm
I'm seeing a junkie, I'm servin' the bomb
Giuseppe my toes, I do that for fun
I fuck on yo bitch while I'm grippin' my gun
I'm throwin' blue hundreds, I don't throw the ones
I walk in that club, the strippers like "ooh, here he come"
Hop out the Rari with hundred round drum
Young Drako nigga, you know where I'm from
Young Drako nigga, came straight out the slums
Young Drako play with the pots, and the bricks, and the bon
I'm in yo bitch mouth, right on her tongue
Nigga want beef, it's filet mignon
I ride in the Rover, I'm mixin' the soda
They call me Young Drako, they call me Young Soulja
Earring right, boulder
Left ring, half quarter
Bust down, new Rollie
This bitch actin' like she know me
VVS, out the water
Young Drako, nigga I'm fuckin' yo daughter
Malibu noble, you know that
I rock new designer, I don't do the throwback
When you get money, you don't gotta show that
I see the Police, I'm runnin' a four flat
I'm hoppin' the gate
Most of these niggas, you know that they fake
It ain't my birthday but you know I'm gettin' to the cake
I put the Yacht right by the lake
Hit from the back, bust on her face
