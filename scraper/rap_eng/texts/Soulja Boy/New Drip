[Chorus]
I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended 30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I might just go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them

[Verse 1]
Hop in Bugatti, push it to the maximum
Young Drako, nigga I’m drippin' blood just like Dracula
In the kitchen, in the trap with a spatula
Whippin' up dope, it's looking spectacular
Bitch in London fell in love with vernacular
Count a hundred fifty K, smoking dope, watching cameras
I'm sippin' codeine and smoking on cannabis
Jump on a private jet and now I'm trappin'

[Chorus]
I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended 30 and it sittin’ on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I might just go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin’ them

[Verse 2]
Balenci' my feet, I put it together
Young Drako, nigga I trap any weather
He made the wrong move, you already know I'ma kill him
Slide in that Bentley, they think I'm drug dealing
Young Drako, nigga you know I’m that nigga
I pop out the cut with my finger on triggers
Flex on that nigga, I made a quarter million
Slide through the city, a matte black Bentley
Black Murci'  like Batman
Stand in the kitchen, I beat up the pack, man
Young Drako, nigga I trap with a strap, man
Pinky ring sittin' on my wrist cost a black Jag'
Nigga, we drop them bombs just like Baghdad (Boom!)
We shootin' first, nigga no we don't clap back
Walk in the VIP, broke nigga back-back
I got a hundred and fifty thousand in my backpack
Smoking on backwoods, rolling up dope, serving good crack
Serving the junkies and fucking the hoodrats
Come to your zone and you know the way I took that
Nigga fell off, ain't shoot back
Eliantte got me shining for real
Run up on Drako, get popped like a pill
Make the wrong move, boy this shit could get real
I went and dropped a ticket on my ear
Pour up a pint, I'm sippin' lean not beer
Pull up on plug, then I disappear
VVS diamond, they looking so clear
Bust down my Rollie, it's looking like burr
A hundred fifty thousand Richard Mille
Zone 1 was signing apartments and trap with the steel
I cannot stop 'til I get a billion
Stupid ass mansion with racks to the ceiling

[Chorus]
I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended 30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I might just go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I'm international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them
