Welcome to my city, bring you to my city
Let you ride around my city, I can
Show you 'round my city, welcome to my city
Bring you to my city, I can show you round my city

Welcome to my city, this my city (x2)
Let you ride around my city
Show you 'round my city, let me bring you to my city

[Verse 1]
We sip lean in my city
We smoke weed in my city, I'm that nigga
I live my dream in my city
You do it big, I do it bigger
I can you bring you to my city, I can show you all the spots
Let you come and kick it
We can post up on my block
I can put you on babe, loud pack the strong way
Zone 1 to zone 3

Double cup with my swisher
We can take a priceless picture in my city, this my city

Bring you to my city, and show you how we rock
Bring you to my city, and have fun all night
And you asking
About where I hang, about where I be at
I be doing my thing, my thing
My Thing
Show you how we ball
Take you to the mall, money stacking tall
Fuck what the bling cost, shawty said she quiet in the club
About to take a ring home
Come and join the team dog
Everyday we ball, like we in a arena
Zan with the lean bruh, shit you never seen bruh
True religion jeans bruh
