Damn man
I got my swag from japan now
Jean claude van damme
Up in that nigga, die hard, trans-am
Really nigga, money like a trans-am
I ain’t tripping, flow god giving
Ground shifting, I think that I’m that nigga
And you think that you that nigga
Do you look off in the mirror?
And you just looking so slizzered
Oh fuck them, I don’t get so hard
Fuck man, I done swagged all day
Fuck them, I can’t wait that ball fade
I been getting active, like I’m parlaying
Damn that nigga French
He thinking, from your upper some other shit
Oh my god, just take a fucking guess

I quarter here man, looking at witness
I’m right window’s tinted
Mind your fucking business
Diving in the ocean like I’m fucking that leper swimmer
Nigga you no contender, do you not remember?
One mill I stuck just like the winter
Twenty twelve I splashed up all my tvs plasma
Ready for the action many she’s a tragedy
Address me as your majesty, this shit right here’s a masterpiece
I fuck off with young, yo, that’s bro, that’s family
And we do this annually, told that K up on me, G

Nigga know that it’s complete
Nigga talk shit you capisce
On the poster with the automatic, talk shit and I’ll let him have it
Niggas know I’m bussing, disrespect pinked off
And there’s going to be repercussions, Soulja tell 'em in public
I’m standing on the couch yes, go swag daddy

If I change fire rings
I made the hood happy
Niggas mad at me, it don’t make no sense
Cause I came with that forty clip on my fucking hip
And I still represent, bitch I make you take a swim
Yeah I’m al pacino, hang you fucking body
Over that building, nigga I mean no
Cut that fucking shush, nigga up in that slip
I got that thing but I repeat
Little Dre, that be my name and my niggas blast for me
Disrespecting black Jesus and that shit is blasphemy
Got my nigga if right shy gunnin' that bentley coop
Word around town paid off and niggas got the juice
Young legend niggas young the ocean got we splashing
Man this shit is just like magic and my swag is all fantastic

You niggas think it’s tragic but I’m balling and you know
Got a million on the low and I would never sell my soul
See sold out the cut signs all across the globe
Pinked off and on their hoe dumb old mario on that hoe
