(Hook)
I'm ridin' through the city
Bad bitch with me
Stacking up a milli
Money to the ceiling
Let me show you how i get it
Everyday I'm living
Lamborgini tinted
You can see who in it


Verse 1: ain't hard to tell I'm winning
I wake up and I get it
Balenciaga my kicks, that's just to be specific
I wake up in the morning
No time for that yawning
I just salute to my army
You know that I stay on it
My girl say she love me
I hit the stage, crowd go wild
Is she in love with me
Or in love with me lifestyle?
Got a bad bitch that drive me crazy
Pull up in a new Mercedes
We go shopping, get it poppin'
We go hard, no option
We too hot, I'm too cool
We get it popping in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stunt and I'm on one, I'm that dude
We too hot, I'm too cool
We get it popping in the swimming pool
We hit the club, she stunt and I'm on one, I'm that dude

(Hook)

Verse 2:They know that I'm stunting on red carpet wearing all black
She asked for that D, so I had to give her that
Drop top foreign, that thing cost a hundred racks
It ain't hard to see my body took a lot of tats
I'm gripping grain, rolling loud pack
I'm the ish, I'm all of that
If I go an spend it, you know that I'mma make it back
If I go an spend it, you know that I'm gon' make it back
Drop top Phantom, me & Stunna, that's back to back
On that South Beach, YMCMB, that Rich Gang been getting money
We on that, pull up in that Maybach
Hit the club, buy gold bottles, I make it rain with eight stacks
Getting money since day one, hold it down since day one
