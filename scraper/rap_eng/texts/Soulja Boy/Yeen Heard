[Hook: Quavo]
If yeen ain't head of broccoli, yeen ain't havin' money
Yeen ain't hear of piped up, yeen ain't doin' nothin'
If yeen ain't hear of dab, yeen ain't havin' swag
If yeen ain't heard of gas, nigga I don't want the pack
Yeen heard, yeen heard, yeen heard of this?
Yeen heard, yeen heard, yeen heard of this?
Yeen heard, yeen heard, yeen heard of this?
Put you up on the lingo, lil bitch

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm havin' dabs, yeah that means that I'm swaggin'
You probably laugh, pay 5 for a jacket
Stuff crust Backwood, yeen ain't hear of gasin?
You gotta roll ya own one, cuz young Quavo not passin'
Yeen ain't hear of Monifah or where your ho at either?
I know you probably heard we call her Evil Kenevil
Yeen ain't head of freezin', yeen ain't heard of taser?
That mean we ain't want no picture nigga, so you can't frame 'em

[Hook: Quavo]
If yeen ain't head of broccoli, yeen ain't havin' money

[Verse 2: Offset]
Yeen heard about juugin that mean take some?
Yeen ain't hear about finesse that make me snake some?
Grab the yacht stick, nigga that the chopstick
I'm a young rich nigga on the yacht, bitch
I don't need no nigga, I don't need a bitch
If yeen ain't heard 'bout Offset yeen ain't shit
Touchdown on the plug, it was a pig six
Don't stare too long at my diamonds, you might get sea sick
You say you know me I never heard of you
Way before the rap check, we were buyin' booze
Quavo 'bout to out it then he chopped the roof
So piped up, she wanna fuck up in the bathroom

[Hook: Quavo]
If yeen ain't head of broccoli, yeen ain't havin' money

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Yeen ain't hear of bright ring, yeen ain't hear on icy?
Yeen ain't hear I finesse the plug for 'em pints, bitch?
Runnin' through the city, fuckin' with the Migo
Yeen ain't hear of white bitch, yeen ain't hear of kilo?
Yeen ain't hear that Soulja Boy get money on the d-low?
Ridin' through the city, got 'em bricks like a free throw
Word around town Lil Soulja goin' HAM
Pull up, me and Quavo and ya bitch, she gettin' smashed
You ain't hear of wax, mayne, SOD Migo gang
Pull up and we dabbin', all my money, cashin'
Stacks on deck, Migos Gang, we live in a mansion
QC on my label chain, Bentley and it's fire flame

[Hook: Quavo]
