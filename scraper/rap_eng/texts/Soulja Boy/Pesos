[Chorus]
Hit the pot with the folks
Spread the cocaine just like an egg yolk
Got some niggas died In zone 4
Pull on your block
Spraying with the Draco
Play with the bands like Claydo
Stack up the bricks like they leggo
Plug in San Diego
You know that I ran up them pesos
(Yeah , urrr) You that know i ran up them pesos
You know that i ran up them pesos
Shooters posted at the front of the back door(back door)
Came up from the bando

[Verse 1]
Put the game , in a four
Spread the cocaine just like an egg yolk
In the kitchen hit the pot with my elbow
Put the bricks in the figure four
Soulja pippin,bitch nigga ain't cuffing no hoe
She bringing me all of that dope
Mini draco shooting through your front door
Im in Toronto smoking gelato
Came up on a hundred bricks, i hit the lotto
Went and bought a bentley, then i bought a gallardo
Made 20 M's i ran as fast as i could to the trap, then wells fargo
Hop in the rarri', went full throttle
Hit a nigga in a head with a bottle!
Young stylish nigga freshing then aeropostale
Fucking your bitch and you know that she swallow

[Chorus]
Hit the pot with the folks
Spread the cocaine just like an egg yolk
Got some niggas died In zone 4
Pull on your block
Spraying with the Draco
Play with the bands like Claydo
Stack up the bricks like they leggo
Plug in San Diego
You know , I'm run then I pesos
(Yeah , urrr) You know i ran up them pesos
You know that i ran up them pesos
Shooters posted at the front of the back door(back door)

[Verse 2]
Came up from trappin cappin in the slums
Nigga pull up with a hundred round drum
Call up more shooters you know they go dumb
Westside, bitch you know where im from
Draco bullets hit your shell like king kong
150 bricks shipping to hong kong
Pinky ring look like hunnit kong
VVS Diamonds ain't no SI1 on the rhimestones
Slide through your hood in a striaght a
Pinky ring cost a brick, chain a mercedez
Shooters they post in lil Haiti
Came in from serving the bond, nigga go to pay me
Diamonds on me four k-9 H-D
Hit your block with the draco spray deep
150,00 on the money counter play me
Mini mac-11 let it bang like chief keef
In the trap, taxing for the pt's
Came up from serving kilo's
I know a nigga hate me
Had to fuck her in her mouth
Bitch you can't date me
Put her on a molly bitch tried to rape me
Got the bricks in my hood now my trap going crazy
Making M&M's out the rock like I'm Jay Z
Wouldn't be rich if I didn't touch a brick
Stupid lil nigga you never been rich!

[Chorus]
Hit the pot with the folks
Spread the cocaine just like an egg yolk
Got some niggas died In zone 4
Pull on your block
Spraying with the Draco
Play with the bands like Claydo
Stack up the bricks like they leggo
Plug in San Diego
You know , I'm run then I pesos
(Yeah , urrr) You know I ran up them pesos
You know that I ran up them pesos
Shooters posted at the front of the back door(back door)
