[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
When I met you girl I tried to pay for dinner
Pulled out your card, I thought I had a winner
She said "Boy I got it," then I said no, but I like a girl who's in control
She's my rich girl, rich girl

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
She rides a Barbie phantom
She lives in a Barbie mansion
She's a rich girl, she got a lot of money
She credit card shawty, she credit card shopping
Man she look good when she shopping
Man she look good when she talking and she walking
She walk like a model, she shop like a balla
She shop like a NFL, NBA high school scholar

[Chorus]

And you know I rich, so together we filthy

You can get it cause I got plenty

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Soulja Boy]
King, and she my queen, when I first met her
I didn't even have anything, she had more money than me
She was a rich girl, grew up in a messed up world
And I met her, she didn't think nothing less of me
She get the bigger picture, she know we both free
But when we thought we can't take it with us and we belong together
Yeah she's so special, she's my rich girl
But if she was broke, I would still
And my neck froze, I told her that I'm hot, she told me that she cold
Together we tornado, so we spin across the globe
I make money every day and everybody surely knows I'm a rich boy, a young pretty guy
And she's pretty fly and she's pretty high
And we're high together, we may change weather
We may change weather, hopes and I love her

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
She's a rich girl, buying all the clothes
Wrist full of gold, you already know
She's a rich girl, yeah, she's got cash
Pocket so thick, she don't even have to ask
She's a rich girl, rich girl
She's a rich girl, rich girl
She's a rich girl, buying all the clothes
Wrist full of gold, you already know
She's a rich girl, yeah, she's got cash
Pocket so thick, she don't even have to ask
She's a rich girl, rich girl
She's a rich girl, rich girl
Aye oh
Aye oh Aye oh
