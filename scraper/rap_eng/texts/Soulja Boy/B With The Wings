[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm in the B with the wings
Trap with my nigga, you know that we serve hot wings (Yeah)
Me and my gang on the same team (Hmm)
Trap out the Hellcat, I'm doing my thing
Two hundred fifty thousand, see my Rollie bling
Walk in this bitch, how you ain't notice me? (Trap)
Red and green B, like Christmas tree (Ooh)
Walk in this bitch with a stick on me (Stick)

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Young Drako, nigga I trap out the mansion
Walk in this bitch and my diamond was dancing
Serving that trap out the Phantom
My young nigga rock out like Marilyn Manson
Young Drako nigga, serve percocets and I serve Xannies (Xannies)
Fuckin' your bitch, she hopped out her panties
Sippin' on lean, it tasting like candy (Lean)
Lil nigga, sit down, I know you can't stand me

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm in the B with the wings
Trap with my nigga, you know that we serve hot wings
Me and my gang on the same team (Ooh)
Trap out the Hellcat, I'm doing my thing
Two hundred fifty thousand, see my Rollie bling
Walk in this bitch, how you ain't notice me?
Red and green B, like Christmas tree (Ooh)
Walk in this bitch with a stick on me

[Verse 2: Lil Mosey]
Walk in this bitch with a whole lot of bands
They say I made it, they say I'm the man
My niggas shooting, Afghanistan
Walk in the crib and I pop a Xan
Last year, they used to hate on me, two-tone on me (Oh)
Three bands and Gucci on me, y'all niggas chasing some money
I'm on a private jet straight to the moon
Talking bout money, Balenci' my shoes
Ice on my neck, got me feeling so cool
Just got a million, I know what to do

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm in the B with the wings
Trap with my nigga, you know that we serve hot wings
Me and my gang on the same team (Ooh)
Trap out the Hellcat, I'm doing my thing
Two hundred fifty thousand, see my Rollie bling
Walk in this bitch, how you ain't notice me?
Red and green B, like Christmas tree (Ooh)
Walk in this bitch with a stick on me (Yeah)
