[Verse 1:]
I got this rolex on my wrist, while I'm riding down the highway
Got 2 lambos in my God damn driveway
Got 2 ounces in my God damn ashtray
Pull up with that uzzi, more clips than a movie
Call me soulja b, took off all your hoes bitch
I ducked on the yay, like the rose main
You know it's owin me, everything on freeze
Young sod, bitch say the mg, mg
Came through the hood with more gold than master p
Swagged up soulja boy, I put that on gd
Ride through the hood, everybody know bout me
Bought a yamaha and I cope it by the 3
Got this rolex on my wrist so I'm shittin on the game
On a 3 wheel motorcycle flexin, switching through the lanes
Got me soulja montana bitch I'm reppin blast game
And I'm scrapped off any bitch nick named max payne

[Hook:]

I got this rolex on my wrist, rolex on my wrist
I got this rolex on my wrist, rolex on my wrist

[Verse 2:]
3030 has arrived, pull up on the scene
Soulja fresh as fuck I'm fly, hopped about the limousine
Eyes red on high, 30 racks off in my pocket
Swear to God no lie
Disrespect my best friend, I promise you will die
See me in the vip, I'm kushy to the sky
Hopped out, I'm fresh as fuck, the rollie on my wrist
Tatted on my neck and arm, damn I'm the shit
Damn I'm the king, bring the toilets when I shit
Iced out Ferragamo cover me and shit
Froze out lookin like a motherfuckin eschimo
Sod money gang, we blew up like geronimo

[Verse 3:]
I got this rolex on my crew, I done bought 10 all
Throw em at the bentley coupe
Fuck hard top, I knock out the roof, rollie
Drop top lamborghini, you can see the proof
Call me bishel, cause they know I got the juice, splat
Riding through the hood, I'm beefin motherfucker truths
He say he poured up, bitch pour douce
Soulja boy tell em God damn, I'm the truths
Rock this rolex!
