Swag
No instruments
Yaw read no nigga
Cash everywhere
Sushi, truck

Forty million salary
Just like the NBA
All white every day
Like I’m in the KKK
Came with the door
With no instruments
I’m swimming
Young Soulja Boy
Gives a fuck
I keep it pimping
Hate on me
Chewing at my enemies
Right down ocean drive
And Agoff is with me
Sinter is empty
Looking like I’m on him
Everywhere I go
Splash cash like I want it
Fuck what you heard
On my turf
That’s the west side
Cause I came out the ground
Just like the oil
Niggas don’t want
Their motherfucking thermo
Five hit your never list
Tell the hoes we’re spending click
Ocean Gang
Twenty twelve I’m splash
What the fuck you heard?
Came with the cash bro
Money on my chain bro
Easy
Everywhere is easy
Yeller diming busy
Make that shit look easy
I’ll freeze it
I’m frozen
Third eye open
Came with the forty clip
Like I post her
Oh your sister wants my face
On the poster
I swag on my shoulder
They case is
You’re gone nigga

Rustling, hustling, grinding, jogging
Working, working, moving, cooking
Plug it, plug it
It’s nothing, it’s nothing
I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it
Shots out to Agoff
This is no instrument

Came out the water with that fifty clip
Soulja I told you
Fifty stars, American flag
..., I came here
Alien on my pants tip
Versace, watch me
Shush, shush, it’s nothing
Ain’t even planning
Ain’t even playing
All that I know
Twenty twelve we going to make it
Rubber band wrist
Just made it

Soulja, Soulja, jogging, jogging
Working, hustling, moving, moving
Grinding, grinding
Shots out to Agoff

What’s all the keeve
This is no instrument
Agoff ain’t got to prove shit
I hustle hard
I don’t got to talk about the money
Cause I got it boy
Five star general
Ocean Gang
Got the money niggas
Can’t fuck with
Now I’m on some harder shit
Cali life, live it
Hustle everyday
Do this shit
Bitch is pimping
Man I’m from a hole
Another motherfucking dimension
Came out the water
And I don’t even got a mansion
Bitches on my dick and shit
I don’t give a fuck them nigga
Talking heat and leaks and shit
Bitch I’m still positive
Ride alright until the end

Hustler hustling, jogging, jogging
Working, working, moving, moving
Soulja, Agoff, Soulja, Ocean
Hustling, moving, jogging, jogging

I came with the master plan
Forty records I understand
Young Soulja Boy
... man I’m busy man
Been a fan
Yeah I know you like this
Yeah I know I’m high stoke
Try to get like us
It don’t even matter
I be posted up
By the lake hallows
Still penetrate
Don’t make me demonstrate
... I been on this … kinky
... I been on the trade
Where you lay
... its Agoff
Go ahead and take off
Don’t want a nigga to cook
The play saw
... the play saw
Just like a horse shoe
I’m on you
Young Soulja Boy came out
Just like forty two
... I’m thirty three
... I’m twenty one
Riding round with fifty
On my neck
List a golden one
Holler, holler
Pimp pop his collar
Bitch on the strove
Rigging word
I get dollar
Moving, working, Agoff, Agoff
Soulja, Soulja
Go ahead and take off
No instruments, no instruments
Look kiss is filthy rich
Soulja Boy got fifty bricks
No instruments
