[Hook]
Thirty thousand, hundred million
All my niggas go so crazy in this fucking building

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Word around town, I got bitches on my dick
Word around town, I got cameras taking pics
Word around town mane, I'm hot than a bitch
Word around town, I spent 3 million on my wrist (True story)
Word around town, I spent 12 million on my crib (Foxtail)
Word around town bitch, that's just how I live (Simpset)
Word around town bitch, my dick taste like ribs
Word around town bitch, what happened to Arab

[Hook]
Thirty thousand, hundred million
All my niggas go so crazy in this fucking building

[Verse 2: Lil B]
S550, drive with my swagger
Hoes on my dick cause I rock like Mick Jagger
Ten on my ho and I'm sharp like a dagger
Pineapple shorty and my bitch look like an actress
Young Based God, flex bitches on my dick
Young Based God, tell police suck my dick
Playboy mansion, chilling with Hugh Hefner
West Berkeley nigga, Waterfront on my sweatshirt, you feel me

[Hook]
Thirty thousand, hundred million
All my niggas go so crazy in this fucking building
