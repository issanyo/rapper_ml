[Soulja Boy]
Man it's ridiculous I got you so delirious
Kiss me through the phone while I lick you just like licorice
I'm Hov back in 96 and you can be my Sasha Fierce
Baby you so sexy, I love the way them jeans fit
Put you on my team Miss, call you Miss Breezy
I'm Soulja Boy Tell 'Em I can make your life so easy
And if you don't believe me please don't tease me
Delirious for my love better yet I got you feenin' let do it

[Verse 1]
Hey over there what's ya name?
Are you for real? Is this a game?
You start to smile and I do the same
I look away but you remain
Your eyes staring back at me (back at me)
My heart starts to skip a beat
I pray that you will never know (never know)
I fall and then you look in my eyes

[Chorus]
You make me delirious
That's when I start to fall
Something serious
When you look in my eyes
You make me delirious
That's when I start to fall
Something serious

[Verse 2]
Now we're over here and you're next to me
You look at me, I find it hard to speak
I start to laugh and you do the same
I look at you, you smile again
Your hand holdin on to mine
The thoughts running through my mind
I try not to let it show
I've fall and then you look in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Hook x2]
Your eyes starin back at me
My heart starts to skip a beat
I pray that you'll never know
I've fallen and you look in my eyes

[Verse 3]
Tell me how you feel
I love it when you speak
Oh you so sweet
It was meant to be
While you're here with me
I wanna know you more
Hold you more
Kiss you till there's no more
Love the way you walk
Love it when you talk
My feelings so so deep
Every night I can't sleep
De-li-ri-ous from my head to my feet
De-li-ri-ous is what I can see
Something serious when it comes to you (yeah)

[Chorus]
You make me delirious
That's when I start to fall
Something serious

[x3]
When you look in my eyes
You make me delirious
That's when I start to fall
Something serious
