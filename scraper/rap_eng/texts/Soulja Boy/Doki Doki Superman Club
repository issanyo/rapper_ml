[Verse 1: Monika & Soulja Boy]
Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with yuuuuuuu
In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and yuuuuuuu
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!
But in this world of infinite choices
What will it take just to find that special day?
What will it take just to find that special day?

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
