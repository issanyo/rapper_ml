[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Top back yeah I got my top back. (Oh my god)
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back yeah I got my top back
Big ass uzi on my hip, ain't gonna cock that. (Oh my god)
Top back yeah I got my top back
Top back riding with my top back
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back riding with my top back

[Verse 1]
Clyde Cabbage in this bitch for another gin
Cuggin' Vodka while I'm flirting with my mother's friends
And I know I'm kinda late but fuck it, then
Happy Halloweed, my blunt is bigger than a pumpkin stem!!!
I just win, don't ever lose, I'm at the top cause I paid dues
Stayed true to game through the short life of these fake crews
Fuck a mile, these lame dudes wouldn't even stand if we traded shoes
Listening to my mixtape, I hope ya speakers is soundproof
Spitting flame, these niggas lame
Them triggers bang at a snitches frame
Let it pop, no red dots, got a head-shot and I didn't aim
Getting brain while switching lanes, I'm still the same ain't shit done change
Forget the fame cause I need dough, in the game, no cheat codes

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Top back yeah I got my top back. (Oh my god)
Big ass pistol on my hip, ain't gonna cock that
Top back yeah I got my top back
Big ass uzi on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back yeah I got my top back
Top back riding with my top back
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back, riding with my top back


[Verse 2]
Fort Wayne, Indiana these my stomping grounds
I'm at the top and now these niggas wanna knock me down?
Like Soulja said "I gotta sleep next to a chopper now"
That Mack Eleven strap'll have 'em running to his momma's house!!
Cabbage got the loud, Soulja brought the Swisher Sweets
Hitting licks door-to-door like trick-or-treat!
But we ain't in the streets, we posted where the dollars at
Get some top then it from the back & never holla back
Got the strap, I cock it and blow ya goddamn noggin back damn
And while we on the subject, I'm getting head like a stocking cap
Popping Xans & blowing pot while flowing hot like lava lamps
OCEAN GANG OR DROWN LIKE I WAS SWIMMING AND I GOT A CRAMP
OGOD

Top back yeah I got my top back. (Oh my god)
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back yeah I got my top back
Big ass uzi on my hip, ain't gonna cock that. (Oh my god)
Top back yeah I got my top back
Top back riding with my top back
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back riding with my top back
