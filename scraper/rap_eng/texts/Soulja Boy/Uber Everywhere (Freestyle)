[Intro]
Wow
You already know man
Soulja
Uber everywhere, woo!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know I'm getting cake
Wake up in the morning, rolling up another whole eight
I got bitches on deck
I got money on my plate
Nigga disrespect the game, have my nigga snatch ya plate
Catch me in that new uber and I'm heading to the cake
Got a whole lotta money and it's right up in the safe
Got a badass bitch, while I'm ridin' to the bank
Pull up in a Lamborghini, I got gas in my tank
I got gas in my blunt
I got lean in my cup
Got a couple bad bitches call em' and they pulling up
Got a couple bad bitches in the car they pulling up
Yeah, you know wassup
Shawty, she gon' let me fuck

[Hook]
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere

[Verse 2]
Jumping out the Uber and I'm smoking gas
Pouring up the lean and I'm on the drink
Got a couple bad bitches, they some twins
I told her "it's a party, go call your friends"
She pull up in an Uber and I pull up in a Lamb
Backyard swimming pool, pop another Xan
Pouring up the lean, pouring up the drink
I be getting money running to the bank

[Hook]
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere

[Verse 3]
The Jordans every pair, I got every pair
You seen them Yeezys every pair, I got every pair
Rollie's sitting on my wrist
In the kitchen whipping bricks
Yeah I'm getting to the money
Yeah I make my cash flew
Got a whole lotta bad bitches and they pull up to the crib
Got a brand new house and it's sitting in the hills
Call up a Uber and we riding, call up a Uber and we riding

[Hook]
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere

[Outro]
Ride through ATL, ride through L.A
I'm rolling up cookies they came straight from the Bay
