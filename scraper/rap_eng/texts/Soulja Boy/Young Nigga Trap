[Chorus]
Young nigga trappin, I slide through the city
Young nigga trappin, I had to get it
Jump out the jet, and I run up a ticket
All of my young niggas with me, you know that they with it
FNN, it shoot at his face
Lamborghini coupe, it's winning a race
Real shit nigga, don’t play about gang
SODMG, put this shit in my chain

[Verse]
Stacks On Deck Money Gang, know what I claim
The fuck nigga? Don't play with my gang
Trappin' them bricks, and you know it’s insane
Walk in the club, and I make it rain
VVS rollie, that bust down
Shout out to squad, you know it's a touchdown
Get out the bricks, soon as I touch down
Run up them racks when I slide through yo town
Young Drako, nigga you ain't know nothin' bout me
Play with the gang, then we sweep up the whole street
He want a feature, I hit him with a feat'
Made history, I know they remember me
Bust down when I ride through the street
Lame ass nigga tryna be like me
Young nigga on SODMG, PTE
Hundred K in one day, that's just me

[Chorus]
Young nigga trappin, I slide through the city
Young nigga trappin, I had to get it
Jump out the jet, and I run up a ticket
All of my young niggas with me, you know that they with it
FNN, it shoot at his face
Lamborghini coupe, it's winning a race
Real shit nigga, don't play about gang
SODMG, put this shit in my chain
