[Intro]
Drako!
Whole lot of this shit, nigga
Bossed up on you niggas, nigga
Drako!

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Walk in this bitch with a stick
Walk in this bitch with a brick
Make the wrong move and my nigga gon shoot
I'm servin' Hi-Tech, lil nigga got bricks out the roof
Look at my Rollie, it VVS flawless, my diamond
I was just chillin, my Rollie was shining
Sittin' in a Bentley, the seats they recline
Bust down that Rollie, the Richard [?]

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Young Drako, nigga I ran up a bag
Slide in that Jag that you never had
I bust down my Rollie, them niggas so mad
I drip in designer, I Gucci my flag
I slide in that Porsche, skrrt, paper tag
Pop out with Draco, I do not play laser tag
I got that bag, nigga so mad
Fuck on yo bitch, and hit from the back
Stand in the trap, bitch, I got the recipe
Buy so many bricks, he throw me an extra ki'
Young Drako, nigga I'm Mobster, Soprano
Play with them ki's, ain't talking piano
Young Drako, nigga my face on a channel
He make the wrong then my nigga gon blam him
Catch him lackin, lit him up like a candle
Young Drako, nigga I trap out the Phantom

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Walk in this bitch with a stick
Walk in this bitch with a brick
Make the wrong move and my nigga gon shoot
I'm servin' Hi-Tech, lil nigga got bricks out the roof
Look at my Rollie, it VVS flawless, my diamond
I was just chillin, my Rollie was shining
Sittin' in a Bentley, the seats they recline
Bust down that Rollie, the Richard [?]

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty J]
Walk in this bitch with some racks
She let me hit from the back
Johnny Dang, fell in love with the ice
Bad bitch, I put her on a flight
You hate but you broke, how that work?
She keep tryna take off her skirt
I want the head first
Drinking, my head hurt
I dropped a bag on some teeth
You put your bitch in a Jeep
Balenciaga, please don't step on my feet
In the trap playing with racks, I walk around like a geek
She want the ass shot, so I bought it
You do what you want when you ballin'
My diamonds wet like a fish tank
I got Hollywood bitches in Burbank
Chanel on the tag, we trippin'
We went from rags to riches
I need a boujee bitch, I'm tired of these average bitches
Pourin' on a pint, now I'm sleepy
Bald headed bitches like E.T
Why the bitch act like she need me?
My diamonds shine bright like RiRi

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Walk in this bitch with a stick
Walk in this bitch with a brick
Make the wrong move and my nigga gon shoot
I'm servin' Hi-Tech, lil nigga got bricks out the roof
Look at my Rollie, it VVS flawless, my diamond
I was just chillin, my Rollie was shining
Sittin' in a Bentley, the seats they recline
Bust down that Rollie, the Richard [?]
