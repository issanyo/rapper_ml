[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I hop on the jet and fly
In the air so high
Big diamonds you know that they froze
I like my Codeine cold

Hop in the jet and fly
Up in the clouds so high
My diamonds they cold, so froze
I like my Codeine cold

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I like my Codeine cold
Hop in my Phantom, then roll
I get 100 thousand for a walkthrough, 50k for a show
100 thousand for a promo
Reppin' this shit like I'm OVO
Hop out that wrist and they looking like at diamonds
All in my [?] look like a Cheerio
Oh no, 100 thousand in one day
100 thousand in your face
Audamars with Piguet
Had to go tell 'em
Niggas be stealing my swag
I'm might go [?] a new Jag
I'ma just raising a flag
Money it come in a bag

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I hop on the jet and fly
In the air so high
Big diamonds you know that they froze
I like my Codeine cold

Hop in the jet and fly
Up in the clouds I'm high
My diamonds they cold, so froze
I like my Codeine cold

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I like my car foreign, I'm rocking Jordans
Balenciaga's, [?] afford 'em
Hop in the Rari its gorgeous
Money like Wheel of Fortune
And you know I'm scorching
Mazi I'm torching
I'm in the Olympics, and I'm steady balling
Just pass me the torch, I'ma flood like the water
The money it [?]
You know [?] and keep the hundred round drum
Hop in the 'Rari and slide
I'm telling my Uber where to drive
In the back seat I get high
On the private jet I fly
Look at inside of my eyes
All that you see is dollar signs
All that I'm getting is money now
Niggas hating, they can't see me
Diamonds, they shining like Pee Wee
Money come in like re-re
Diamonds they [?] in 3D
Look at my face on the TV
Two bitches like Stevie
Money come in like Michael J
Getting the money like every day
Hop in my 'Rari and rollerskate
Money come in, you know that they hate
I'm real and you know that they fake
The diamonds is up on the lake
I put the money in safes
Meet me at the safe house
Versace at the stakeout
Thirty thousand bring the [?] out
I hop out the 'Rari, it's a race now
Niggas talking like they getting money
Man, they fake out
I been getting money
Back it up, like in a Wraith now
I'm like I'm in a race now
Lamborghini and Phantom
Hop out the 'Rari, I never say sorry
I got this money and mansion
