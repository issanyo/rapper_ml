[Intro]
Money gang, you dig what I'm sayin'?
Rich gang
Man you see what the fuck going on?
Nigga, Versace on my belt, gold Cuban link
You dig what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
Don Corleone (x3)
Lean in my Styrofoam
Don Corleone (x3)
Lean in my Styrofoam

[Verse 1]
Vito Corleone
Godfather on his throne
Lean in my Styrofoam
Beef with me I get you gone
My [?]
My crib look like God though
Try to rob though
Get hit from the squad though
And now I know they gone
King Soulja, Don Corleone
Act in my Styrofoam (Actavis)
Kush in my microphone (lean, lean, lean)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Crank up the volume
Young Soulja, Vito Corleone
Vito, gold on my throne
Gold, Versaci hair and bone
Head shot in broad day
I'm shootin' up the alleyway
Young Soulja get a brick a day
A hundred k a day, hundred k a day
Niggas talkin' like they want they drama
Pull up on they block with the llama
I don't go nowhere unless it's 'bout commas
SODMG we 'bout that drama

[Hook]
