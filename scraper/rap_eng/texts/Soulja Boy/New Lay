[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Ness on the beat
Yeah, Soulja, Soulja, Soulja

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Zips, Xans, Gucci, bands
Steaks, shrimps, no McDonald's
Diamonds drip, Avianne
New York, Tribeca, top ten, my record
My wife, respect her, your bitch eat Checker's
I solve her problems, I buy red bottoms
Every day we lit, it feel like Lucci
We cashin' out, got matchin' Gucci

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
And now she tryna smoke with me
Now she tryna roll with me
Bust down on my watch while we're on the beach
When we wake up in the mornin', that's a shoppin' spree
When I cop one brick, then I'm coppin' three (yeah)
I got ice on my neck, everywhere I be (yeah)
It's a whole lot of bands next to me (yeah)
When I wake up in the mornin', she next to me
Got a hundred racks on me, I count it up (I count it up)
The Lamborghini Porsche truck was mounted up (skrrt)
Forgiatos swerve when I pulled up (skrrt)
A whole lot of bag on me when I pull up, Soulja

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me
I might buy you a new lay today
If you sip my drank, don't go to sleep
At first you didn't notice me
But now your bitch, she tryna smoke with me
