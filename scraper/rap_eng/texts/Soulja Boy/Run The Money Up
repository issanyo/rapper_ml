[Verse 1]
All of my niggas they stacking and packing

Two to three bullets we shoot let them have it
I'm drippin the [?] domo automatic
Nigga they talking we savages
We wrapping the bitch then we package it
We make sure the grams is accurate
The chopper make them so a backflip
I put the weight on the balance beam
Wrap that shit up in plastic
Playing with the belly beam like gymnastics

Hop out the Rari you know that I'm flashing
Louis Vuitton on my glasses
Gucci came and I shit on they ashes
The money coming then I'm flashing
Standing by the new Rari
Hop out the Lambo I never say sorry
My niggas they shoot up the party

Hundred thousand in went down and I faced it
Fifty thousand I spend that on the bracelet
Hop out the Rari hopping out the spaceship
Look at the money nigga in the cases

Get to the money fucking with the haitians
Stacked up the money I had to have patience
Nigga talking man they just gotta face it
Put me in the trap you know I do numbers
Miss Louis Vuitton with the Pharaoh Gummo
Niggas smashing and splashing yo baby momma
Hit her from the back nigga animal jungle
You know that I ran up them bands
A young nigga missing those xans

You fuck with me I'll murk yo man
Pockets rocky in my pants
