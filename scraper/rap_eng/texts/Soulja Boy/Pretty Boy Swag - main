[Chorus:]
This right here is my swag
All the girls are on me, damn
Everybody pay attention
This right here is my pretty boy swag (ayeee)

Girls on my dick when I pretty boy swag
Girls scream my name when I pretty boy girls
Watch me pretty boy swag (ayye) [x4]

Girls scream my name when I pretty boy girls

Me and my crew we swaggin in the room
Girls on me heavy 'cause I look so sexy
Yellow diamond shawty in the club straight flexin'
I'm lookin' 4 a yellow bone long hair star
Thick in the hips come and get in my car
You party with a star we take off and go to mars
