[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Verse 1]
The most lyrical comprehensional Soulja Boy Tell'Em I'm three dimensional
My swagger's off the fucking chain
I am not no fucking lame
Off the top of my fucking brain
I go hard on this track mane
Soulja Tell'Em mane, my motherfucking wrist same color as a damn taxi
Nigga don't ask me or grab me, harass me
You fuck niggas flash me, your task bitch
Soulja Tell'Em I'm back on the track again (track again)
What's hannenin (what's hannenin)
What's hannenin what's hannenin what's popping and what's stopping him
What's stopping him? Nothing
Cause I'm on deck like your motherfucking bitch on my dick
With her lips and she sucking sucking suck and suck I bust (bow)
Bow
Soulja Boy Tell'Em make you bust now
I'm on deck
And you already know that my chain look just like snow

[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Verse 2]
Do you see how my watch glistening?
Or do you see how this black teeth fit in?
Damn I'm fixing to rip this them grips so hard I'm off my feet like I'm flying
Flyer than a motherfucking island
And I got your bitch smiling, she wiling
I did-her-did-her-did-her down good
Up in my hotel suite I'm like George Bush
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, Soulja Boy Tell'Em
Soulja Boy, are you listening?
Bitch quit hissing, I can see you
But you can't see me
Soulja Boy Tell'Em I'm a fucking fool
So much swag and I'm super cool
Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck away from me
Or my goons might go ahead and sprain you, B

[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Outro]
I'm the shit, mane
I'm the shit, bitch
I'm the shit, bitch
I'm the shit
I'm the shit, bitch
I'm the shit
I'm the shit, bitch
