[Intro]
Ya' know the fuck goin' on nigga(Big Soulja)
Big Soulja(Big Soulja the mixtape, Big Soulja the movie)
Draco(Big Soulja the movie)
Skrt skrt(Draco gang, Stacks on decks money gang)
DJ Ransom Dollars in the building, turned up to the max

[Hook]
Big Soulja
Trappin' blocks, Whippin' pots
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' guap in the spot
Big Soulja
10 chains, 10 whips, 10 bitches
10 bricks, in the kitchen flippin' shit
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
(DJ Jerry nigga, he's goin' hard man, you'd hear me out bitch)

[Verse 1]
They call me Big Soulja
I'm trappin' and cappin' that white
Mixing the lean with the sprite
Covered in ice, whippin' the dope all night
Ridin' 'round, and you know that I'm trappin'
Spent cash for the X6 and the Aston
Patek stand on my wrist
Perfectly dabbin'
Maison Margiella, how I fashion

[Interlude]
Big Soulja, bitch rich before the deal
17, made my first M
Broke my wrist when I jumped out the gym
Swimmin' pool at the crib but I can't swim
18 had to get an M
With a pyrex and a pot, I can whip a 10
Fuck around and run another dividend
Havin' my way with the shit, nigga rich

[Verse 2]
Jumped out the trap then I whippin' the beat
I got i8, automatic and the stick shit
Lamborghini with a new key
Bust down, my wrist, teach you how to hit a lick
Got rich or die trying on my 50 cent shit
Disrespect, Big Soulja get the stick
On the shooter, he know he ain't gon' pop shit
I got the F'n'N with the 30 clip

[Hook]
Big Soulja
Trappin' blocks, Whippin' pots
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' guap in the spot
Big Soulja
10 chains, 10 whips, 10 bitches
10 bricks, in the kitchen flippin' shit
Big Sauce, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja

[Interlude]
Yeah man, view on your motherfuckin' trap
You know, you know what I'm sayin'
Your car, your crib, where you at man
Turn the song, turn this shit all the way the fuck up
This that sauce nigga, Big Soulja nigga
Niggas scared of me man, I ain't even gonna lie

[Verse 3]
I came up trappin' bands
Made an M when I came home from jail
They had me locked down in the cell
That's the only reason I don't fuck with 12s
Draco drive-by, and then I throw a chief
He sneak dissin', got popped like a pill
Sneak dissin' draco, but he can't pay the bills
I come through, hit the nigga with the steel
Standing in the trap, having ice in my clip
Young nigga hit the lotto
Young nigga smokin' on gelato
I don't have any bricks, buyed the Cando'
That's the lean in that baby bottle

[Hook]
Big Soulja
Trappin' blocks, Whippin' pots
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' guap in the spot
Big Soulja
10 chains, 10 whips, 10 bitches
10 bricks, in the kitchen flippin' shit
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
