[Intro]
I walked in the muhfuckin club playing GameBoy Color
I'm retro, nigga, everything, nigga
I made swag, I invented juice (juice juice juice!)
I invented SOD

[Hook]
I look so good, I look so pretty (Dre!)
I'm conceited (Dre)
I look so good, I look so pretty (Dre)

I look so good, I ain't looked this good since I was 18
Excuse me if I say a couple things that I don't mean
Like I look better than your girlfriend
And we can all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these old niggas?
Mad cause I make it look so easy..

I look so muthafuckin good, I look so muthafuckin great
I smoke so muthafuckin good, I drink that muthafuckin lean

[Hook]

Walk in side the club, make them hoes touch their toes
I look so good, nigga, fuck Sandra Rose!
Fuck all them blogs! Bitch I'm on my job
You keep talking down I bet you get your ass robbed
Soulja Boy Tell Em, bitch, I'm headed to the top
Pretty Boy Swag, man, them hoes on my cock
Step inside the club, everybody just stop
Looked at my dick, damn that shit got hard!
Soulja Boy Tell Em: god damn I came hard
I put my city on and I put that shit on God
24/7, bitch, you know I'm in the streets
I look so pretty, bitch, I'm killing all these beats (Dre)

Fuck Sandra Rose nigga! I don't give a fuck

[Hook]
