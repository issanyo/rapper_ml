Soulja..Kony, 2012

Right now, there are more people on Facebook
Than there were on the planet two hundred years ago

Humanity's greatest desire is to belong and connect
And now we see each other

Stop Kony, Stop Kony..

Stop Kony man, I can't believe it's going down
From my town to your town
They taking kids, turn em into souljas
Put a gun in his hand and his life is over
It's getting so crazy, gotta take it over
We gonna stop Kony, it's 20 over
It's 2012, 10 summers
Kidnapped the kid took him to the jungle
AK47 and he can't never ever
Never seen his daddy, never seen his mama
Make this his history, all you gotta do is believe
Soulja Boy Tell Em tatted on my sleeve
SODMG

The next 27 minutes are an experiment..

Stop Kony, Stop Kony..
We can do it y'all
Stop Kony, before it's too late
Soulja..
