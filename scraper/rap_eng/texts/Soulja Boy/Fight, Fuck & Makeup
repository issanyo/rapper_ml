[Intro: Bow Wow]
Aye, you know, I guess it’s just some shit we just not doing
Everybody saying, that shit sound hectic but
But we just keeping sticking this shit out though
Yea

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
And she do it for attention
When she acting up, she get put all in suspension
She be acting like I ain’t got no other bitches
Girl you always tripping, why you always tripping?

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Every time we fuck it’s like the sex get more intense
Soulja said I’m tripping but I think I love this bitch
Rolling blunts after sex, got the pussy all wet
Girl I know what you want, stop playing games take it all
So cute when you mad, you the baddest bitch I done had
And she know I’m playing with them racks
Come fuck me for a Birkin bag
Want to beat it from the front and eat it from the back girl I know that you like it
(?)

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
And she do it for attention
When she acting up, she get put all in suspension
She be acting like I ain’t got no other bitches
Girl you always tripping, why you always tripping?

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I came up from the bottom
Riding with some goblins and she know that
Got my baby riding with me I’m getting a lot of racks
Then we hit the Fendi store, and we blow racks
(?) go time to roll, drop the top off the Rolls
When she start tripping she get no dick
Bought a brand new mansion in Los Angeles
Bust down Audemar and Rolex, can I take you home babe
Sipping lean not Bombay

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
All we do is fight, fuck then we make up
And she do it for attention
When she acting up, she get put all in suspension
She be acting like I ain’t got no other bitches
Girl you always tripping, why you always tripping?
