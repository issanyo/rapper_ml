[Hook]
Work in the kitchen
Plenty money on my phone
I might hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Rockin' all my chains on
I might hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Got 'em goin' crazy like I just came home
It's time to hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Rockin' all my chains on
I might hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
(Got 'em goin crazy like I just came home)

[Verse 1: Bun B]
When it's Bud B and Khaled
You know that it's a winner
You know I got the yams like a thanksgiving dinner
I'm trappin' on ham like a thanksgiving dinner
And bringin' a drummer like I'm Mr. Thanskgiving nigga
The game it's switched up
In white winter black
So gimme, he already know the hook me up the fact though
Mo money, mo ice
I ain't buyin' no price swear I'm on that one time
They lookin' so nice
These old ladies saying he look like a low life
I'm in the foreign with a foreign makin' your wife
Got me a piece of a pie
Now where's your slice?

Work in the kitchen
Plenty money on my phone

Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Rockin' all my chains on
I might hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Gotem goin crazy like I just came home
It's time to hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
All my chains on
Rockin' all my chains on
I might hit the club
Rockin' all my chains on
(Got 'em goin crazy like I just came home)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Shawty in lights
Roll another dice
Big money bitch
Cash money life
Flip another chicken
Bought another chicken
Cook another chicken
Fucked her in the kitchen
Pack another meal
Hot up in the feel
Always strapped
Me and Khaled in the hill
Diamond close to ice
Fly poppin' flights
Uptown solider spit the meal on the watch
And as I proceed to make some more G's
Represent my city
Shoe for bee
Uptown G's
YMCMB's

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
10 diamond chains on my neck
I called DJ Khaled cause I know we the best
Said can't never cup another check
And I'm down in Miami
Ridin' in the phantom
Somewhere by south beach
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
Got a million dollar mouth piece
On my dog mutha fucker dead leash
Put your lighters in the sky
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
