[Verse 1]
Off top nigga, don't fucking play
Stacks On Deck boys, bitch yeah we in this thing
Money Gang, tat that shit up off my armored ring
On my chain, fifty diamonds standing money bling
Ching, ching, I done cashed out like a jackpot
And I'm big dog flexing like Sandlot
In my hood, man we stack them shit's by four blocks
I'm turned up, and we get them by the C-knots
C notes, cut throat with my campaign
Fifty racks make it rain, make it hurricane
Young Dre, I go hard and I spit flame
Off top, money boy's in this thing

[Verse 2]
Pull up to the party, it's time to have some fun
Standing on the couch, and I'm throwing funds
Stripper bitches on me, it ain't nothing though
Do this every fucking night, all across the globe
I hop up on the jet, it's time to cash out
I hop up in that Vet', it's time to smash out
My homeboy copped a Ferrari, so I copped a jet
I threw thirty racks on my fucking neck
I pull up to the trap, to finesse
I call my young nigga and he hit the plug
Now we in the trap, pulled up off mud
I pulled up in that Lambo', skurt' scrub

[Outro]
We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
Yeah we in this thing, me and my nigga's in this thing
