I can't quote the Bible
I skipped Sunday school
And I can't count the times I fell, and broke the golden rule
So I don't know if he listens
Sometimes I wonder if he cares
But maybe I'm just wishin'
'Cause I can't even prove he's there

(chorus)
But I pray
He'll watch over my children
I Pray
Just to be a better man
To find the strength to rise above
To be there for the ones I love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray

I confess that I don't bow my head as often as I should
Mostly just when times are bad, rarely when they're good
And I don't hold with too much preachin'
But I was raised up to believe
That a man can't ever stand as tall
As when he gets down on his knees

(2nd Chorus)
So I pray
For a world that's gone half crazy
I pray
For every woman, child and man
To find the strength to rise above
To teach each other how to love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray
I pray
