[Chorus:]
Baby if you pop it there
It’s going to have you feeling like a superman (superman)
Baby if you pop it there
It’s going to have you feeling like a superman (superman)
If you have it bad she’s going to go ahead and bust it open
She seem quite real now she open
Baby just pop it there
It’s going to have you feeling like a superman (superman)

[Verse 1:]
Baby if you pop it them just go and represent in my car
You can pop up in my lambo cause I’m a star (star)
Now if you pop it here you can turn into the Soulja’s biggest fan
And I’ll be killing them kill them with the lean oh
I woke up and feel like i was in a dream
I’m a poet activist and with the cream
I’ll be pullin and you know i keep that lean (lean)
Shout out to my squad

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Now you know I’m getting gwack (getting gwack)
Filling ferol bubble with a Soulja shot (a shot)
I just got the maserati off the lot
She says she in it with what i got
I say baby go ahead and drop it down (drop it down)
We can run the maserati through the town
I’m going to make it rain hundreds coming down
You know what it is going around the town
I’m going to make it rain and you

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Baby if you pop it there
It’s going to have you feeling like a superman (superman)
