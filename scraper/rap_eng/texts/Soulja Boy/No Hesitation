[Verse 1:]
I got a hundred on me now I can’t wait
I had to give you money
Nigga no hesitation
I fuck your bitch so quick no hesitation
I need the money right now why am I waiting
I fucked out the time to your probation
I had to call my lawyer he got a bail
You know the police they be talking they snitching crazy
You know these niggas they snitching they talking crazy
You know these niggas they ball without no limit
You know they Soulja I ball gotta go get it
I gotta get it my nigga what am I waiting for
Imma get the spider fuck that, the bayesian hoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I had to ask myself what am I waiting for
I had to hop in the Rari I know they hate it though
I had to stunt on these niggas I had to go and kill it
I had to cut them new diamonds I had to hurt they feelings
I had to get it bitch
I fucked her then I did her dirty
I had to powder cup
I had to pour it, it’s so dirty
I know these niggas know
They see me and I [?]
Unable to transcribe line
I had to fuck her the right way
I show these niggas talent
I had to take out the earth
Cause I don’t want them talking
These niggas copy
They watching, they know everything I do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I pass the zero right now why we waiting
He told her mily right now she couldn’t take it
These niggas walk in the streets the looking basic
I had to cop me a spider I’m going crazy
I need a hundred thousand right now for the wait
I walked inside the bank, no hesitation
No hesitation for paper, gotta get papers
These niggas snitching so crazy all by the papers
These niggas snitching straight on you they F for failure
These nigga talk down upon you they F for failure
These niggas snitching they hate on you, hate so crazy
I’mma fake a  baby mother but I ain’t having no baby

[Chorus]
