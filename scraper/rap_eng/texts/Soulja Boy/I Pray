My life is a movie and everybody watching
Are you entertained looking at me partner?
I made it out the hood
Lets get this understood
People think my life is good
But there's way more to
Rumors spreading fast they trying to take my glory
But there's two sides to everybody's story
So let me tell this story truth no lying
I hate when my momma
Called me crying
Telling me "Dre, I feel like dying"
Telling me "Dre, I feel like dying"
I remember growing west side of Atlanta
Couldn't pay the light bill so we put up candles
I'm asking mama questions
She giving false answers
I didn't want to leave my hood
I just couldn't stand it
Move to Mississippi and I finally had a family
Move to Mississippi and I finally had a family
My dad, my sister and my newly born brother
The first time I had to call another woman mother
Flair I love ya, I know I didn't show it
My mum asking me for money
And you for nothing
Every day I told ya
One day I'ma make it
And if I never told ya really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya I really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya I really appreciate ya

I got girls who claim I got them pregnant
My life is really hectic. I'm going through the spectrum
Don't hate it just respect it
And if you can't respect it then I guess that's too bad
And if my life don't change then I guess that's too sad
With every move I make I make a lot of people mad
But with a lot of moves I make I make a lot of people glad
Glad, glad yea glad man I do it from the heart
And if I wasn't gonna finish I would I even start
I'm Soulja Boy tell 'em and my life is a movie
But all I gotta say is please free my nigga Gucci
Soulja Boy tell em my life is a movie but I got to say is mane free my nigga Gucci
