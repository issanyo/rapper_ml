[Intro]
Fuckin' all these bitches
Came, came up from zero

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Came up from zero

Fuckin' bitches that I never fucked before
Gettin' money when young nigga on the road
I came up from zero

Now I'm fucking girls that I never fucked before
Fucking girls that I never fucked before

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I might let her drive my Bugatti
I might let her ride my Ferrari, yeah
I'm gettin' money I'm gettin guap now, ohh
Money I don't need when I'm jumpin' out the Wraith
Smokin' on dope got me higher than space

Fuckin' different girls every day
Countin' up the money every day

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Came a long way from zero
Now I'm a neighborhood hero
Movin' that pack like I'm Nino
Takin' nigga's shit like I'm Deebo
My lil bitch she got water like FEMA
I'll be your Martin and you be my Jeana
Lil Duke and Soulja Boy in the hills leanin'
Brand new Ferrari, I don't do no Beamers
Fuckin' all these bitches I've never seen before
Fuck all my partners and fuck the whole team it go
I do this shit for my people though
And I got strips like a zebra ho
Pull out the chopper, these niggas they faster than cheetahs
My niggas buzzin' like beepers
Poured a whole 8 in a liter, this shit illegal
Step in the back when I'm smokin' a reefer
Burning like Snoop Dogg, I'm chiefin'
Niggas be flexin', they broke and they leaches
Please tell me how can I teach 'em?
Boy you get popped if you reachin'
Po we gon' stop you from breathin'
Ran it up, turned to a liter
Cause I
