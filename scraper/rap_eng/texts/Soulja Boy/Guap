[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning thinking bout that guap
Catch me in the kitchen whippin with a gold pot
Sunk ass nigga with a o knot
I'm a young ass nigga by the whole block
Trap going crazy for that nigga soulja
Bitch I'm bout a chick, I went and crashed the rover
Rolex on my wrist cost me 12 chickens
Catch me in my kitchen and I'm water whippin
Think again plays like it ain't shit
Ridin through my hood with the k with no brakes bitch
40 On my face, getting cash
Catch me in the hood, gucci sky mask
10 Chains I done copped em for the summer
4 Cellphones as I'm hoppin out my hummer
Got no stendos if you want attention
I think he want attention, I think that nigga snitchin

[Hook]
Guap, guap, guap, guap

And if you ain't getting money then boy you need to start

[Verse 3]
5 Cellphones, I ain't got a landline
Kushed up and my eye red
Pirelli on my tires, call me 6 bands
Catch me in the hood and I'm leanin off that kickstand
Still hittin plays, call me lil dre
Ridin down the highway on a friday
I need it my way, I need 9 trays
Pull up to my trap, I full plays
I'm still bustin jewels, everything good
Four cuban links on my neck, trap out the hood
West side, zone 1, who want the anna?
Scarface 6, tony montana

[Hook 2]
Guap, guap, guap, guap

I'm getting guap, guap, guap, guap
And if you ain't getting money then boy you need to start

[Verse 4]
Shorty lookin in my way, it's lil dre
I think I caught it for the rim, I be my fuckin ways
It ain't really nothing, I'm still swaggin
Lambo, 2 door, ready for the action
Hangin out the window, I might get the blast
Everybody know sod be set
Still hittin plays, thinkin bout the billion
Stacks on deck, bitch we stackin money to the ceiling
