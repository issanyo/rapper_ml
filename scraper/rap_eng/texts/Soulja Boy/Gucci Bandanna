It's Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I roll with Shawty Lo
I got so much snow, Gucci head to toe
Chain on chill, (chilli) watch on freeze
So much ice I got lookin' like Chinese
Gucci shades, but they still can't hide me
I hit the club eighteen with no ID
I changed up the format, welcome to my crib
Leave your shoes at the doormat
And ain't this beat tight?
My chains say hello, my watch say goodbye
And I still look right, this is the good life
This Gucci bandanna it just to make me look tight
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna

Gucci bandanna, call me Gucci Montel
Gucci girl with me, Gucci bag, Gucci sandles
She too hot to handle, hot sex, burning candles
Gucci Mane, a player, Gucci shopping this extravagant
Gucci Mane drive a drop top red Phantom
And my bed got them super size Gucci spreads
Pull up to the hood, stop and let them jock Gucci
Broads jock Gucci 'cause Gucci just Gucci
Yeah, my boxer briefs, equipped with double G's
Gucci key chain, holding on my Gucci keys
Gucci down all the time in the summer time
I'm Gucci Mane, you would think that was my clothing line
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna

Shawty Lo, I really wanna Lanna
Scarf 'round on my neck, Gucci bandanna
Haters talking slick, they filled with anger
But I don't care so goddamn 'em
This big ol' watch costs more than yours
I built a house you can't afford
It's stupid big, got an ocean view
It's way up there, I look down on you
We flexed down here, that's what we do
Get in my way, I flex on you
Acting monkey, we keep bananas
Keep them goons with me, Gucci bandanna
Scarf 'round my neck, Gucci bandanna
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna (ey)
But I don't care so goddamn 'em
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna (ey)
I built a house you can't afford
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna (ey)
It's way up there, I look down on you
(Ey) Gucci bandanna, Gucci, Gucci bandanna (ey)
