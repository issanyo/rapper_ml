[Intro]
Wassup, Wassup?
Wassup, Wassup?
Wassup, wassup, wassup

[Verse 1: Twinnzel Washington]
When I first started I thought my shit was retarded
I had to take a break, had second thoughts as an artist
Bitches on my phone, I don't want to talk I'm recording
Don't want to be a side chick but she don't know what to call me
My songs done blown up, they rode my shit like a Harley
I rep Marrero but yeah I was born in Harvey
I'm more about the money and yeah you slow with the talking
I'm about to drop a mixtape to flush your shit down the toilet
Hard to recall if I heard your mixtape but if I did it must be garbage
And we ain't gonna talk about albums cause if I get it it's probably torrents
Damn dog, riding on my dick it's probably harnessed
Haters say "wassup" like Martin Lawrence
Wassup

[Hook: Soulja Boy and Twinnzel Washington]
Yeah
All my ice freeze, all my ice freeze
All my ice froze up
When I walk inside the club, girls on me
Cause I'm so Icy
All my ice froze on me, on me, on me
I say all my ice froze on me, on me, on me
On me

[Verse 2: Twinnzel Washington]
Snap backs and tattoos
White girls with black dudes who do what they're asked to
Swallow these like capsules
Sick with the swag flu, she all on my cashews
I roll with some bad dudes
You cross me, that's a bad move
Zone Gang, that's my team, if you don't know get a damn clue
Tripping off not damn dude, we in here for them damsels
She ain't down then damn you, bring that to your man, boo
I'm back up on my rap shit about to slap shit like a bamboo
If you speak that cash then we can talk, Tevin Campbell
And you know the plan boo, you understand you'll get ran through
I started as a youngin, they thought that it was nothing
But now I've made some moves they're like 'now you're on to something'
Well ok, I'm on
I get in it, I'm gone
My chick she bad, red bone
I kissed her once, she stoned
I hope that cures your curiosity about what I'm on
The word is you don't like me but you keep calling my phone
Leave me alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
My necklace is legendary, my bracelet is historical
I'm rolling on another level these niggas they can't fuck with him
They fuck with us, jumping off planes just like we are skydiving
I'll eat your ass alive man, look at our eyes
In the game out here scoping, riding third eye open
Niggas out here loccing and smoking
Five hit his nose man, look at they will bleed for
Tell him why he heave for, I tell him he is evil
All them they're deceitful, they is not my people
We are not equal, I hit them with the sequel
Chopper with the eagle, I'm out here in the desert
Have that bitch for desert
Take her off her desert
Hit her with the

[Hook]
