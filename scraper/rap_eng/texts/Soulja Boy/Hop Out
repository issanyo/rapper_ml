[Intro: Juicy J]
Cash nigga
We throw that shit away
Just spend all of it you dig?
Stay in the strip club
Sip a lot of Lean
Smoke a lot of weed
Drink gin and whatever you want

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
You know why I post (know why I post)
Chevy said turn up on you folks (turn up on you folks)
You know I’m gon' tear it up (tear it up)
I’m in the block in your area (wussup?)
Switching lanes, Ferrari, Bentley (swag)
20-12, man I had to do it (had to do it)
Shout out to my brother Gucci (wussup?)
SOD, we shot a movie (yes)
Taylor Gang, what’s happenin’? (what’s happenin’?)
Drop top in traffic (traffic)
Me and Chevy, yea we do our thing (do our thing)
Hop out and let my chain swing

[Hook x2: Chevy Woods]
Yea, your bitch see my cash, she wanna know what I’m ‘bout
Yea, niggas see my car, you wanna know the amount
I hop out, hop out, hop out, hop out
Hop out, hop out, hop out, hop out

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I’m blowin’ down the 1-01 and I’m rollin’ just like a pill baby
I’m a menace to society, look at the wheels (look at the wheels)
Yea, so with this money they ain’t seein’ me
Shout out my nigga Soulja and you know that’s SODMG
You know I never take a day off
I’m ballin’ off for extra shit, my nigga that’s the play-offs
Just like we livin’ off the great escape
You talkin’ all that shit, we know that you won’t bust a grape
Yea, me and dat money, we just made a date
My pinky and my wrist, you know that’s just the 28
Yea, so what all that beefin’ we ain’t worried ‘bout
My niggas eat that shit for lunch, they call it in and out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Stuntin' all a nigga doin’ now
Ferrari, one open seat
I got two in there, I speak money fluent now
You be ridin’ on the neck, she chewin’ out
I get cashed up, get obsessed at juvenile
Double cup and smoked out in my latest car
I feed these ratchet bitches dick and some Xanax bars
My team is full of ballin’ niggas, why you actin’ hard?
I be swiping black cards, y’all niggas be ridin’ hard
I’m feeling like D Wade, I’m ballin’ in the games
Plus I got some new heat, call him Bosh & James
You don’t get the picture, nigga I’m out the frame
Hall of famer, everybody know my name (trippy)

[Hook]
