[Intro: Announcer, (Komato$e), & {Soulja Boy}]
This is [ bsd.u ] & Yung Vamp on the beat
Light a fat blunt and get educated
(Man, when you hear this shit
Oh my god
Alex, when you hear this shit
You're gonna die
You're gonna be so hype)
{Hopped up out the-
Hopped up out the-}

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Hopped up out the bed
Turn *moan* swag on
Took a look in the mirror
Said "what's up"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money
Oh
Hopped up out the bed
Turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror
Said "what's up"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money
Oh

[Verse: Komato$e]
Car on E, 'cause you know I been whippin'
OG hearts in them young ass children
I can't charge 'fore I get my energy
Run up on a runner up, I ruin all my enemies
The death of religion got a lot of people trippin'
But you'll never catch me slippin' 'cause I don't need a reason
To keep on breathing, I keep on living
Dirty Sprite Christ in the booth, he has risen
Po' up
All my boys gon'
Roll up
Give y'all a condolence
Skrrt up outchea
Doughnuts
So disrespectful
Rappers gettin' heckled
I show up as a specter
Eat a bitch, I'm Lecter
Nothing lesser

[Hook]
