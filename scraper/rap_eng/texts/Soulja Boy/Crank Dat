[Intro] (LAiNE):
Sorry to the game! Hit it KG!
(Awwwwwhhhhhhhhh!)

[Hook] (KG):

Watch us crank it watch us roll
Watch us crank 'dat Gilioli
Then eat some mac and cheese
Now watch me
Crank 'dat Gilioli (oh no)
Crank 'dat Gilioli (fo' sho')
Crank 'dat Gilioli (you already know)

[Verse 1] (LAiNE):
Back up in this
You know i'm killin' it
No Nike but you know i'm Just Doin' It
Crankin' everyday until I can't feel my face
Wake up in the and i see her pretty face
Spray a bitch with mace
If she wanna play games
Actin' like a little kid but all she do is talk shit
I'm a god to these kids
Take me on trips
Go on shopping sprees
Always shoppin' Versace boy
KG know what's up
Chillin' in the cut
Rollin' nothing up
We don't play that 'cuz we pass that
But we pass that ass
I get aggressive and wanna tap that ass
But I know my limits and I know when to crank 'dat
So KG, tell 'em what to do!

[Hook] (KG):

Crank 'dat Gilioli (you already know, KG!)

[Verse 2] (KG):
Holy moly, Gilioli
Eat yo' girl like ravioli
Throwin' money in the air
Green, call that guacamole
So much ice up on me
Like we playin' hockey, I'm the goalie
Never won Stanley Cup, but I got a trophy
All these others rappers plastic
Like they fuckin' bags of groceries
Don't hear what I'm saying?
Better shut up, listen closely
LAiNE & KG ain't no saints
But our mixtape yes its holy
Damn, its so dynamite
We gon' blow up, Wile E. Coyote
Crawl up inside yo' bed gettin cozy
Like i'm Goldilocks, 3 bears
No wait I'm Yogi
Fuck the ranger, I ain't boo boo
I steal picnic baskets
I'm so fresh, makin' y'all look like some geriatrics
Pull up on these rappers, and I leave 'em in they caskets

[Bridge] (LAiNE & KG):
Soulja ain't got it
But you know we 'bout it
Killin' this shit
And you know this track lit
Rappin' over steel drums
So much mac & cheese

Take a Tums
