Trap spot , nigga trap spot
Trap spot , nigga trap spot
Shooters run up on you
Just like black ops
Bitch I got them bricks
In my trap spot
Trap spot , nigga trap spot
Run up in you shit
Just like black ops
20 bricks in my trap spot
Trap spot , nigga trap spot

[Verse 1]
Ok , damn 12 got my face hot
I put bricks in the trap spot
And lil Soulja gettin a lot of money
I mean big , Soulja Draco hold a hunna
Reach for my chain I sprayin' dummy
Hollow tip bullets ripping through his tummy
Get the P wrap the brick like a mummy
Draco on me nigga ain't take none from me
S.O.D money gang hit the scene
Shoot and pull up and I shoot with the red beam
Running up hot with the mask like Halloween
Draco clip long like a Limousine
Hit your block turn this shit like Halloween
Hundred thou' what he paid for the thing
I comin' for servin' they call me a king
Tell a work and I rapping some lean

[Verse 2]
Ok , shooters posted at the front door
Mini draco , sittin on my lap
Who want smoke?
Call up the plug , he pull up
50 bricks of coke
Bitch I got them keys
In Belieze sittin on a boat
Rich for being Soulja chain
Hollow tips hit his throat
I got junkys on my front door
And shooters at the back door
12 hit the side door I crippin to the pari√≥
Bitch I got the mini draco in a bando
Bitch on shooters just they came up
Just like rambo
Bitch we kickin' in your front door
Draco clips with the ammo
Bitch I pull up in a lambo
Draco out the window
Fuck around smoke bricks
Comin' out the East coast
