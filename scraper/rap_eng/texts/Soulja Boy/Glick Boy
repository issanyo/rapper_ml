[intro 1: Soulja Boy]
I see like 3 or 4 niggas runnin through the crib, 1 nigga run to the front door, I hopped out n start shootin, pow pow pow pow pow, shot the nigga, pow, shot his ass pow pow po- pow

[intro 2: eNJae]
Ahh, e-N-J-a-e

[verse 1:]
I made it outta MD like Stefon Diggs
DRACO gotta stck but that bitch still kick
Like a dyke tryna have sex I bring out the dick
If he bring his mans we got extra clips
40 in the clip i mean 3 in the clip
Thats 1 for his dome if he talkin that shit
We got hollow tips if we wanna make him flip
He mustve forgot im a boy with mad glicks

[hook]
Glick boy and I always been a rich boy
Bitch boy you get hit with them sticks boy
No Toy Story, we got bog toys
If he run up on me you get split like a split boy

[verse 2:]
Like a pig tryna have fun we came out the mud
We runnin him down if he try to run
For any feds tappin its a prop gun
You niggas ain't valid you niggas is bums
Its durag enjae on this bitch you shouldve known that
If we catch him in traffic boy we ain't gon hold back
.223, extended mags we ain't scared to blow that
Nigga think he really hard we body him we leave him toe tagged
30 shells and in leaning, purple Aquafina
We saw them orange tips bitch we ain't scared to sneak him
Said your mans said hes hard, we know thats a lie
Sending shots fast off, like Kakarot

[hook]
Glick boy and I always been a rich boy
Bitch boy you get hit with them sticks boy
No Toy Story, we got bog toys
If he run up on me you get split like a split boy

[verse 3:]
Leave that nigga in the dirt, like a seed
Need some work try to stain we got Glocks with red beams
Fuck you talkin bout we ain't shooters all my niggas blowing steam
