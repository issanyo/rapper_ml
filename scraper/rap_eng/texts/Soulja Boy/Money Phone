[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Money phone, money phone
I been getting money off the money phone
Money phone, on my money phone
Catching plays, bustin' jugs, all off the money phone
Money phone, money phone
Don't you talk, that's my money homes
Money phone, talking on my money phone
100 thousand dollars, that's my money phone

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
They say Soulja you eating good
Go and stack them Robin jeans in the hood
Go and hand a stove cause my back wood
I been getting money like you broke ass niggas jug
Whippin' with my wrist tornado
Hop up out the whip, diamonds stack like Lego
Take your gun to the lay low
Stacks on deck, rich gang you know
Just the 1's to the 3's to the 4's
Welcome to [?] we pouring up 4's
Welcome Versace its all in my clothes
Designer, designer, get off the boat
Young Soulja Boy I be whippin' the coat
Soulja tell em word to the pope

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Money phone, money phone
I been getting money off the money phone
Money phone, on my money phone
Catching plays, bustin' jugs, all off the money phone
Money phone, money phone
Don't you talk, that's my money homes
Money phone, talking on my money phone
100 thousand dollars, that's my money phone

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
These niggas looking sad, niggas looking broke
I shoot a pussy nigga in his throat
Bullets I supply 35 million
Catch me in the stores with my wrist whippin'
King Soulja 3, King Soulja 4
Swag bless the album, I might kick your door
I might buy your ho, I might sell some blow
I might sell out a show and do it in the open
Shout out to my folk, yeah we blow that smoke
Run up on me bright day, boy that's hallows boy
Shout out to the Rari that the low low boy
Soulja balling like he hit the lotto boy

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Money phone, money phone
I been getting money off the money phone
Money phone, on my money phone
Catching plays, bustin' jugs, all off the money phone
Money phone, money phone
Don't you talk, that's my money homes
Money phone, talking on my money phone
100 thousand dollars, that's my money phone
