[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]

Damn, I'm so savage

With that black card nigga and a yellow bone bitch

I'mma fuck her throat dog cause a nigga savage, riding with my young niggas and you can't have shit
Calling plays and my niggas bring it through, Young Dre aka; throwing money out the roof
Smoking loud after loud after loud to the face
Nigga talking fuck shit brought the K's and beat the case
