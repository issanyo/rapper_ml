[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You fuckin' with the number one stunna
Scoop you up, and hit Bennihanna
Talkin' bout the one that's in the Valley
Shawty from Atlanta, but in Cali
Hit Rodeo, she in love with all this Prada
Feel like Roddy, 10 toes in Balenciaga
Versace sheets, damn I feel like Silkk Da Shocka
Xan with the soda, 24 and Soulja

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Broadie shoots, shot Scottie Pippen
So many girls, they think I'm trippin'
Ridin' in that foreign, foreign whippin'
Hit the club, 38 tip it
I don't give a fuck, I don't grip it
Hop inside the whip, money gettin'
They done fell in love with my vision
I be gettin' money, guess I'm gettin' it

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl

[Bridge: Soulja Boy]
You know that, I pull up and I'm killin'
You know that I'm full forgiato whippin'
You know that I'm out gettin' money, whippin'
Baby, I don't know why you trippin'

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl
You know I had to flex for the summer
Blew a bag in Bennihanna
Baby girl, tell me, what's your number?
Baby girl
