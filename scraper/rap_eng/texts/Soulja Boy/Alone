[Verse 1]
Put the bricks in the figure 4
I stand at your front door, ski mask, with a draco
Got some homies died in zone 4, they gon shoot when I say so
150 bricks shippin' to Santiago
2018, bring the twirl for Diego
Made 20k and ran as fast as I could, being well far ago
100 pounds of cookie, I hit the lotto
Went and bent a Bentley, then I bought a helado
I feel like Pinkman, cooking in a Carado
Hop in the Lamborghini, Forgiatos
Trappin' n cappin' on smokin' gelato
You know the lawyer beat the case
Smokin' gelato I'm high in the space
Wake up this morning then I went and bought a Wraith
Smokin' gelato, so you know how I space
And then call my lawyer, I got caught
With the draco with the case
2 pistol on my hip
Man I feel like Max Payne
Let the draco sink just like T-Payne
Hit them just like Noha Kane
Yeah, hit them with the draco
He gon' feel a damn thing
Know that we pull up, we come with them dracos
Go empty the clip, Ice is so ice in my clip
Got the patek on my wrist
All bitches, fuck and suck dick
And they bust it out, get your pick
