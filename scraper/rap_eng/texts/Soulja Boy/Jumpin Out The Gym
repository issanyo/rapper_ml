[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Young nigga grippin' that semi
Ridin' 'round I got lil 100 with me
Grippin' that semi, shoot it to his auntie
Ridin' 'round outside I'm sittin' in the Bentley
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't gettin' no money
Niggas be broke as fuck and it's funny
I be gettin' to they money you dummy
Stackin' it up, gettin' to the money
Stackin' a million, got millis on millis
Versace stackin' on the ceiling
Just look at the choppa wrong
You look at me wrong, grab the DRACO and I'm pealin'
Niggas knowin' what it is
Young nigga rich cause I'm stackin' all these years
Chain and the choppa and I make it right back
Zone one out the summer hill

Pull up in an outtie and let the .223 spray
Ain't 'bout that talk, what you niggas gonna do?

SOD thats the gang, bitch I'm ridin' with Big Soulja
Pop ya head like a soda, lil nigga I thought I told ya
