[Intro]
Sri Lanka
It's goin' down world wide
It's IRAJ and Soulja,  Sri Lanka

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Hit the mall and im switching lanes
A lot of diamonds on my neck like six chains
Baby girl round me and you know that
Everything official i got gucci on my doormat
Jump in the whip then i smash out
We dont talk about the price we just cash out
Me and you we just doin what we do
You know im always thinking bout you
I need your love all to myself
I dont wanna see you with nobody else
She calling my phone tattos all inked up
I pick up the phone and then we link up

[Bridge: Soulja Boy]
Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

[Verse 2: MARKIA]
You ain't a ride or die, you would die to ride
Gave you TLC but then Lisa left I
Thats when our texts fly, arm out the X5
With my S6 showing me the exit
You precious and I ain't desperate
I know realness when i see it
The one I wanna be with
You can take it you can leave
With dreams so big I ain't even gotta sell em
I sit back and let Soulja Boy Tell Em

[Bridge: Soulja Boy]
Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

[Verse 3: MARKIA]
Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
Said I'm riding with you
Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
But are you riding with me
I can't leave you alone, even though you did me wrong
I think we got, I think we got, thats why

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

[Outro]
I ain't even thinkin' bout you
I ain't even thinkin' bout you
I ain't even thinkin' bout you
I ain't even thinkin' bout you
