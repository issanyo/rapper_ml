[Hook:]
All black everything
All black everything
All black everything
All black, all black

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Black cars black cars I'm so legendary
Black beautiful girls put they numbers in my Blackberry
All black phantoms bruh everything's legit
All black everything, I'm feelin like an eclipse
Souljaboytellem yea that's my name
All black diamonds in my Lamborghini chain
My chain look like lighting my beats sound like thunder
Black and white mix man I'm feeling like Obama

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
All I'm black everything man I try to warn them
Check out my grill...George Foreman
Real talk Im ahead of my time man
All black everything feeling like a blind man
No where near my prime no optimus
You can keep trying but it ain't no stopping us
My lyrics coherent with my altitude
Hustle mentality it's instrumental casualty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Aw man I'm swagged up
Black on black jewely when I hop in the car
Music is blastin' the cameras are flashin' and
The people be screamin' because I'm a star
SOD M-O-N-E-Y G-A-N-G I'm killin' the game
We holdin' the recipe all black everything
Even my pinky ring never say who are we look at the jewelry
T double O for 7 365 all black everything till I say otherwise
How do I do it man? nobody knows
I be so hot but my flow so cold and I'm so new but y'all so old
They play my song all across the globe
All black everything repping so heavily
Ready they better be girls they feelin me Soulja!!
