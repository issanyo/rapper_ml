[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]

I woke up feelin' like the mother fuckin' man
2005 I had a fuckin' master plan, 2011 I hold a Hundred Million
In my hand, Im the king, yes, yes, yes I am
Niggas talkin' down, but bitch im goin' up
Ridin' through my damn city like what, the fuck
I'm a god damn mother fuckin' prophet
Niggas hatin' on my clique I tell a bitch, stop it
Hold that, ho fast ima getta ho thangs
Chicken one swing and it look like propanes
Goddamn its Lil' Dre, swag bout a hundred k
Any rapper, any beat, im hittin' nigga Hundred times
Lil' Dre a Hundred riding drum on that clip through
Tell em what that shit do, that whole thang will flip you
Your whole crew gon' miss you, missle
Nigga the hollow tip will hit you from narrow bone to your tissue, what up?

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]

I woke up, Anotha day
I might hit the mall and spend about a Hundred K
They call me Soulja Boy, or Lil' Dre
If ye ain't talkin' money, get the fuck up out my face
If its a murder scene, there ain't no witness
I ain't bein' mean bitch, I'm just bout business
Go an rep where you from, nigga throw it up
In my Bugatti, police trynna slow me up
If I ran for the damn election, I would get elected
Swag so meticulous
I lived to see a black president, I lived to see a 20 million dollar residence
Its Lil' Dre, man I feel great
Fuck your life, fuck your bitch, fuck your mama too
Fuck Any nigga hatin' on my fuckin' crew
SOD money gang, bitch I thought you knew

[Hook]
I be nothing but ???boy ???boy
Thank God I'm a Country Boy
Thank God I'm a Country Boy
Thank God, Thank God I'm a Country Boy, boy

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]

I dropped 30K, in foot soldiers
South panola high school, boy I been told ya
Nigga swung, then I ducked and I been fold him
Fuck ya talkin' bout, Soulja Boy done been told em
The cash, bitch I been showed them
In the strip club a Hundred K, I been throw'd it
Real talk on that Lambo, I been blow'd it
And I'm on but, you been know that
Before he swung on me, shit I been stole on em
Before he can roll the blunt, shit I been smoked it
He wanna tow the gun now, shit I been towed it
He wanna fuck the bitch now, kid I been poked her
Try to cop a chain now, my shit been frozen
Try to buy the Bentley bitch, I done been drove it
He got one bitch, nigga I got 8 open
Swag kilo, looking like Beethoven

[Hook]
I be nothing but ???boy ???boy
Thank God I'm a Country Boy
