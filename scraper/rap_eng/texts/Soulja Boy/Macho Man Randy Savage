Hey how about that rari i never had

How about they cool it and i never had it
All of this money and i whipping major
With my whip in the kitchen I’m doing magic
How about the rari I’m going magic
Scarface ain't mention and the couches got plastic
Getting money is so fantastic
Niggers be talking they soon be laying on the plastic
All of them money the diamond dancing
How about the rari walk in the mansion
I’m flexing these niggers i run my thing
And i don't check what a man says
Like I’m a renaissance
I should not be asking in the kitchen they have to have it
Money any we smashing it and grabbing it
How does this money come in
All of my shooters gunning
Nigga I’m number one nigga you never getting nothing
Got get them for something
This nigga when from nothing to something
Look at my wrist with a quarter million we turn into a 100
How about that rari i never had it

We get to the money you niggers are fronting
You never see your nigga truck
Never seen your nigga flipping it and packing it
These niggers gotta go and get rich
A hundred thousand in a briefcase
I’m doing 200 on the E way
But they come at me anyway
Forward to the club i just bought a truck

A hundred million come up the road
I’m in the kitchen and I’m ripping it and pay
Listening to niggers that rap
Flexing these niggers like renaissance
Flex like a macho man gotta have it
I’m in the kitchen shippin it I’m ready for it
Flexing these niggers like renaissance
