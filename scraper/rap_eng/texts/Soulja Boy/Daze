[Hook: Ja-Bar]
Man im in a daze
Walkin round round in a maze

You know i love ya babe
But u know i gotta go
Keep your number on my speed dial
Man im in a daze

You know i love ya babe
But man im in a daze

[Verse 1: Ja-Bar]

Man im in the daze man, walkin past money in amazement
Eyes low from the kush, similair to Asian

My waves are success yes i call it swag surfin
My business so corporate but my style so urban
Never rock skinnies jeans but yo girl still jerkin
