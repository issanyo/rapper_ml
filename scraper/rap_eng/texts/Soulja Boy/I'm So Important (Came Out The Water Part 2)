[Intro]
This that mothafuckin' blonde hair don't care mixtape
(Huah!) Ocean Gang we in this mothafucka'
2012 my year
(What, what)

[Verse 1]
Came out the water
And you know I'm swaggin'
Twenty gold chains cuz' I'm down to make it happen
Automatic shots leave you dead in yo' actions
When I walk around man I'm hoppin' out the (?)
Gold grill shawty and I think that I'm the best
Got all these hoes on me, bitch I think I'm Kanye West
Young Soulja came out the water like I fell, bitch
Pistol on my hip, hoe I take you on a trip
Man I will not slip
Catch me countin' stupid greens
Got so much money, bouncin' like a trampoline
When I'm in the club, bitch you know I'm in the V.I.P
I got all them racks on me, I got all the cash on me
Soulja

[Chorus]
Came out the water
Swag cross the border
Black girl, white girl, go on take yo' order
If you ain't talkin' money then it's not important
I'm so important
Very important

Came out the water
Swag cross the border
Black girl, white girl, go on take yo' order
If, you ain't talkin' money then it's not important
I'm so important
Came out the water

[Verse 4]
I swag just like Drizzy
Make a bitch get busy
Ridin' around my trap, better yet my fuckin' city
Soulja Boy, a.k.a who fuckin' with me?
So much cash, mayne, rockin' out the Stussy
And Bape, all you niggas fake
All you niggas hate
Get the fuck out my face
Bitch I'm throwin' too much weight
Bitch I'm headin' to the cake
Tell a bitch to pop her breaks
Tell a bitch to fix her face
Man I swear my life is great
If it real, why you fake?
Got that Hummer sittin' on eights
If you come to the [?], you can see, where I stay
It's a big dog bossing 'round my city like it's profit
I got so much cash, I tell a broke bitch stop the talking now
But the product got cash comin' in my hands
Soulja Boy tell them worth about thirty million man
Damn, I'm the shit mayne
Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg bitch, yeah
Pull up to the trap
Drop the top I'm filthy rich bitch (Ok)
