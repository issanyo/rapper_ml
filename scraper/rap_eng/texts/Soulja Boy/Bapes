[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Check out my Bathing Apes; I'm fresh to death and you like me
Don't try to cop my style man, stick to them Nikes
Green, white black inside these, super clean Bathing Apes
My shoes like my chain, shine hard, they might hurt your face
I'm clean in this thang, B-A-P-E-S up on my feet
Fresh fade with the waves and 30/30 Boyz up on my tee
You want to get them (yup) but you can't get like me (nope)
Asking me: "Soulja Boy, where you get your shoes?" (AYYY~!)
