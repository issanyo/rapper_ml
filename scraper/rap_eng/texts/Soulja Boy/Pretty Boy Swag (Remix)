[Intro]

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Swag turned to the maximum
She know what it is and know what it ain't
Go hard in the paint like Flocka Flame
That Gucci Mane and I'm off the chain (Gucci)
Got pretty swag diddy bop
With a pretty girl in the club
Look like bugs all on my fingers
Earrings flashing, bright like a blinker
When I hold my wrist up it's a turn signal
It's funny to me, you are dumber than me
If you think your man got more money than me
My tennis shoes cost two thousand a piece
I'm a quadruple OG murdering beats
This right here is my new Lambo
Yellow on black with the yellow for Forgiato
Pull up with a yellow bone sippin' on Moscato
Yeah nigga handsome jumpin' out the Phantom
Red drop head ridin' round East Atlanta
Soulja Boy Gucci Mane hittin' with the tandem
Girls rock with 'em but the haters can't stand 'em
Out shine 'em and out last 'em
This right here is the pretty boy anthem
Quarter on the watch, half a mil on the chain
And the charm right here make a rapper can't stand 'em

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
This right here is my swag
All the girls are on me, swag
Everybody pay attention
This right here is my pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Girls on my dick when I pretty boy swag
Girls scream my name when I pretty boy swag
Watch me pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Watch me pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Watch me pretty boy swag (Ayy)
Girls on my dick when I pretty boy swag
Girls scream my name when I pretty boy swag
Soldier!

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Get out the way
Pretty boy comin' through
Me and my crew we swaggin' in the room
Girls on me heavy cause I look so sexy
Yellow diamond shawty in the club straight flexin'
I'm lookin' for a yellow bone long haired star (star)
Thick in the hips come and get in my car (Soulja)
You party with a star we take off and go to Mars
Pretty boy take off in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
This right here is my swag
All the girls are on me, swag
Everybody pay attention

I'm pretty boy swaggin' in the club I feel sexy (No homo)
No homo shawty but my chest is straight flexin' (Flexin')
Tatted on my neck, shawty said she choose me (choose me)
She got nice titties and a fat ass booty (Booty)
Took her to my condo, let the girl strip
Then she got naked then she pretty girl dipped (Soulja)
Damn I like the way, lil' mama shake that ass
She pretty girl dancin' while I pretty boy swag
