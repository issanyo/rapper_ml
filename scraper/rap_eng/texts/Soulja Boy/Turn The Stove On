[Chorus]
I got the pack the racks, you know
I got them bricks, they came out the bowl
All of my niggas they whip, stand in the trap, nigga turn on the stove
I got the bricks, nigga let's go
I got the bricks, the bag, the bowl
Hunned pounds came in I serve em by the load
Woah, I'm servin' and go
I got them bricks in the bowl, like stand in the trap and turn on the stove
Aye, gang gang gang, serve by the load
I got the bricks in a bowl, like stand in the trap, nigga turn the stove on
​
[Verse 1]
Stand in the trap and I turn the stove on
Stand in the trap and I got a whole bowl
Pull up, Porsche, nigga i'm gone
New customer, I gotta serve the whole load
Lil' dray nigga, get it in by the zone
Got a badass bitch blowin' up my phone
Sippin on purp out the styrafoam
Think she fell in love with a nigga cologne
I'm rich as fuck and I eat it up, stand in the trap with a brick and I beat it up
She slow it down, told her to speed it up, young nigga pull up in a Porsche truck
Bust down my Rolex, it look like some snow
Look at my diamonds, they glisten and glow
We came wit a brick, I serve the whole load
I walked up in Neiman's and bought the whole sto'
​Mention her, I got the brick for the low
Big backwood, good cookie dough
Stand in the trap and I turn on the stove
I got gelato smoke zone
I'm really busy, keep hittin my phone
I just sell a brick, then i'm gone
How the trap house got marble flo'
Fuck it nigga, I just sell some dope
​
​[Chorus]
I got the pack the racks, you know
I got them bricks, they came out the bowl
All of my niggas they whip, stand in the trap, nigga turn on the stove
I got the bricks, nigga let's go
I got the bricks, the bag, the bowl
Hunned pounds came in I serve em by the load
Woah, I'm servin' and go
I got them bricks in the bowl, like stand in the trap and turn on the stove
Aye, gang gang gang, serve by the load
I got the bricks in a bowl, like stand in the trap, nigga turn the stove on

[Verse 3]
Damn, how he just gave him another call? Ooh
I got the gas in a cookie jar
Young nigga, pull up a hunned shots
Fuck it, I pull up and buy the block
Fuck it, I pull up and buy the lot
Stand in the trap, and a young nigga beat the pot
Pull up, a Porsche, and drop the top
Left wrist, alotta guap
Nigga just skurt off the lot
Young nigga pull up with guap
We servin them bowls, we servin them blocks
Say trap nigga, ridin' round with the Glock
I got them bricks, and a Bezel, you know
All of my diamonds it look like snow
All of my niggas they pull up and blow
I got the chopper, just let it go
Hunned racks layed on the floor
Nigga just pull up in Mansons
All of my diamonds they dancin
Stand in the trap with the phantom
All of my diamonds they glisten
Stand in the trap when I drip
Stand in the kitchen, and turn on the stove
I got the bricks, and I got the bowls
​
[Chorus]
I got the pack the racks, you know
I got them bricks, they came out the bowl
All of my niggas they whip, stand in the trap, nigga turn on the stove
I got the bricks, nigga let's go
I got the bricks, the bag, the bowl
Hunned pounds came in I serve em by the load
Woah, I'm servin' and go
I got them bricks in the bowl, like stand in the trap and turn on the stove
Aye, gang gang gang, serve by the load
I got the bricks in a bowl, like stand in the trap, turn the stove on
