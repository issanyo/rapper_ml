[Hook:]
Soulja what you doing?
Soulja what you doing?
Soulja what you doing?
What’s up?
What’s up?
They want to know what I’m doing
They want to know what I’m doing
They want to know what I’m doing
What’s up?
What’s up? (x2)

[Verse 1:]
I’m working, I’m working
I’m moving, I’m jogging
Hint twelve players
Might cling into it
I’m high stock
Yeah, yeah I’m high stock
It’s Nero
I’m so froze
Like that nigga Sub-Zero
Loud pack, OG Kush at optimum
Twenty twelve, Bentley
Ain’t going to stop at them
Riding round and I’m swerving
Everything’s moving
Soulja’s more curse him
They want to know what I’m doing
BZ when you dropping?
BZ what you doing?
Every day splashing
I’m feeling so splashy
Money Gang
Fifty thirteen, What’s happening?

[Hook x2:]

[Verse 2:]
My bitch got a fat ass
Bring her to the crib
Let her see that you wrote that
Get her more cash
Every day I hustle
See me in the truck
And I flex the muscle
Moving bars
Putting bars
This the UFO
Trim at the water
Niggas like they go
Fifty
Young Dre bitch
I know you know what’s up
Sushi
And I’m riding round
In that armored truck
Fall abide they are not identified
See you saw
I know
And that is certified
Everything’s applied
And my eye red
And I’m anything
Man my tier slipped

[Hook x2]
