[Hook]
I took my ice out the freezer
I'm in the trap like a beeper
I got that dope in the speaker
I took my ice out the freezer
I got a brick in the freezer
I hit the block with that reefa
I got a stick in the bleachers
Real real nigga I just spent your re-up
All my diamonds they real
I took my ice out the freezer
Real real nigga I just spent your re-up
Im trap like a beeper
I got that dope in a speaker

[Soulja Boy/Verse]
I put my wrist in the water
Young nigga fucking yo daughter
I just pull up in a foreign
All this money its pouring
I just hop out in Giuseppes stepping counting it up in the morning
Hop out the rarri I never say sorry you know that this money still pouring
All of my diamonds they coming in new
All of my 100s they coming in blue
Im a just pull up and hop out the coupe
Im a just pull up a pint of the juice
Young nigga play you know that we shoot
Im a just pull up you know they make news
All of these diamonds they coming in new
All of my diamonds they coming in new
All of my diamonds they shine
All of my diamonds they hit
Stand in the trap with a brick
Walking around town with the kicks
All of these dice in the whip
I put the dice in the whip
I shoot the dice on the strip
F&N stay on my hip
I'm out here just like a beeper
I'm in the trap with the heater
Run up nigga get murked all of these diamonds they freezin
All of my ice is wet, all my bitches they wet
All of this water is wet, bust down on the neck

[24hrs verse]
I flew my bitch out the A
We took a flight to the bay
Skrt skrt skrt skrt thats a brand new drop
40,000 on me thats a brand new watch
Bitch im doing numbers I can tell you feel me
If you got that 40 then you better kill me
Push to start drop Bentley I'm on 85
Too much drip for a verse I need 85
Treat my bitch like this designer im a fold her

New chain like a snow cone
Balenciaga mix it with the v lone
Brand new chain like a snow cone
