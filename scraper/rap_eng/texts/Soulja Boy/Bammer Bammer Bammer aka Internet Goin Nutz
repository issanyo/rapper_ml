[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Sitting in my mansion with the kush in the air
West-side Atlanta it's getting hot down here
Everywhere I go people taking my picture
Thank God for the day and then I light up a swisher
Girs say I'm the sexiest nigga rappin
I just think she's saying that 'cause she love my swag mayne
I'm in love with a girl whose last name is Carrie
Carrie say my ice chain make her vision blurry
I gotta be a pussy beast the way she bust it open
I fucked this girl so good nigga I deserve a trophy
I beat it from the front all night like she told me
I hit it from the back and then I watched it in slow motion

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm doing the best I can
All my fans put your hands up
And light it up
And smoke it up
And feel me
And feel this
Bammer bammer bammer
Get it in
Twitter king, bitch

Bammer bammer bammer
Get it in
Twitter king, bitch

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Every channel bitch you see me

I like girls who like to party
All my parties RSVP
Soulja Boy is chilling chief
And can't no other rapper see me
Got my swag copywritten
Can't no other rapper be me
Brand new drop payed cash for it
What is my answer bitch? He asked for it
Soulja is international get your passport
Ain't no competition, no
And I didn't ask for it that's sport

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm doing the best I can
All my fans put your hands up
And light it up

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]

All black with the mask but it ain't even halloween

[Alternate Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Bammer bammer bammer
Get it in

Tell me something I don't know
Like who invented this shit that I smoke
I'm doing the best I can
All my fans put your hands up

[Verse 4: Soulja Boy]
Just got off the plane
They scream my fucking name
I'm higher than a plane
'cause I was smoking Mary Jane
Soulja [?] and have them hand it over
Riding in a brand new black range rover
I'm tatted on my throat and stomach
Hoes see me coming running
Soulja Tellem' yeah we yo biggest fucking fans
All in Japan, eyes low like 'em Asian
Smoking on that smoking on that smoking on that flavour

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I'm doing the best I can
All my fans put your hands up
And light it up
And smoke it up
And feel me
And feel this
Bammer bammer bammer

Bammer bammer bammer
