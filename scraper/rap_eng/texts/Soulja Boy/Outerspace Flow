[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
My diamonds are casted
Rims wrapped in plastic
I'm in outerspace
Chillin with the Jetsons
My flow is perfected
My goons over-protective
Smoking presidential
My weed is elected
I am well-respected
I am well-connected
I am in the hood
In the hood nigga section
You girl is my food
I had her for breakfast
And after we sexed man
I left that bitch breathless
This is not school
So please do not test this
My flow is illegal
My vocals arrested
You don't want beef
You must know the police
Your girl sucked on my dick
And it felt like she had no teeth
Soulja Boy Tell Em'
Yeah I am a beast man
In hip-hop I go ham
Now let's have a feast man
I am a dog
A dog off the leash man
If you feel like a frog
Than go ahead and leap man
I'm on my green shit
My football field team shit
You're on your wack shit
That you have no swag shit
I might fuck your girl
Or I might just fuck that bitch
Or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch
After I fuck make her make me a sandwich
I am so random
Girls think that's handsome
Haters hate mad throwimg temperature tantrums
Soulja Boy killed them
Fucked them
Downed them

[Verse 2: Arab]
Arab!
Call me Arab but I'm not pakistani
Sprunt to your granny
Cause that ho cand stand me
I am the man
That's why I demand money
Hop on the track so fast
Call me Arab Bunny
Scratch that Arab Money
Laughin, Arab Stutin
In you hors face and I keep on cuming
Song after song
I continue to be bumping
I'm right and your wrong
You continue to be nothing
I got bars, I got cars
I got hors I'm a star
I got mars on my side
The aliens are down to ride
It took me two nights to do What I did tonight
I'm so high
Why the fuck do I catch a Flight?
You're girls leaking problem Just got handled by the pipe
Me and you are the same, really, sike!
Bitch I go harder than a Train on full throttle
Followed by Godzilla
Followed by you and salt Rockets
My money so fire
Give you real hot pockets
Tryna hate on S.O.D
Aw bitch stop it!
My watch still tocking
Saying that it is my time
The crowd rocking
Arab, they screaming
It took a lot of grinding
So you better keep on Dreaming
Or better start thinking
Of a master plan
I throw away the cats
And I collect all the cash
Of course I am gorgeous
I collect all the facts

[Verse 3: Lil Playboii]
I pull up in Lamborghini's
Stuntin through your city
You can never see me
'Less your looking through a TV
The cheese like I'm Mickey
The brain like I'm Pinky
Lil mama going ham on my Dick like bigly wigly
Her boyfriend want to be me
Cause I'm the one she cheat With
Thinking she a virgin
But I fuck her evry weekend
My fuck is on them cheeses
American to Swedish
I dare you talk shit
Before your
The pound on that green tip
From A-town to D-Sip
I stay on the hustle like T.I
So free Tip
Free world, free pimp
Take off, my brim
Moment of Silence for my boy
Dolla Bill

I' back on this track
Like the white chick on Superman
Think I'm dong hair
The way I'm popping these rubberbands
Stackz On Deck standing Taller than a rubberman
Swagg Super Clean
Like a bathtub bubblebath
Fucking with a rat boy
Call him ninja turtle man
Messing with my money
Get jacked up like Urkel's pants
Playboii on the beat
Call me the murder man
Pokemon ice
Pikachu Squirtle man
Reppin' for the cat like
Allison in Wonderland
East Atlanta's own
Six Decater I put on man

[Soulja Boy] Yeah Goddammit!
