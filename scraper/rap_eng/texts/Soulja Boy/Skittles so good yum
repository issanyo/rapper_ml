Turn up time man
King Soulja, two!
Yea, the movie!
SODMG, salute the Birdman, Rich Gang
SODMG! She bad
Got all the bitches
We on tour!
Soulja, Soulja, hey!

(Hook)
Busting jugs, busting jugs
Make it play, make it play (racks)
I got bands on me
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
She got skittles on her
Different colors on my chain
I got money everywhere
I got skittles on me
She got skittles on her
I got skittles on me
Different colors on my chain
Different colors on my watch
Different colors on my ring
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me

(Verse)
Busting jugs, busting jugs
Make it play, make it play
I got all these bands
I got guap on me
Got a new Rolex and I cop the AP
All these gold bricks, bitches, SOD
I'mma work with the fork
Shout it to New York
Soulja took the game and I made it work!
Let's get it!
She kick shit like Liu Kang
Soulja rock ice, new chains
I think it's about time for a fucking new king
Many niggas tripping, go and tie you shoe strings
Soulja got them kicks, something like Jay-Z
My diamonds, they look like a light show
I'm getting the cash, no typo
I'm iPhone, no eye scope
And I'm on with no ice on!

(Hook)
Busting jugs, busting jugs
Make it play, make it play
I got all these bands
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
Different colors on my watch
Different colors on my ring
Busting jugs, busting jugs
Make it play, make it play
I got bands on me
I get racks all day
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me
I got skittles on me

(Verse)
My diamonds looking incredible
Soulja Boy get guap and I have more guap on my schedule
Rich Gang, we're ahead of you
Second, no catching my revenue
New Bentley coop on no twenty-two
That Lamborghini was brand new
Got brand new jewels and shiny shoes
Own a G, five protégés
Make yee screaming my name
Who's that?
I got new shoes, I got new jewels
Ten rings and ten chains
New whips, new ice
Damn! This is the life!
Ferogamos in his shoes
SOD, rare jewels
Groovin cruise the way I cruise
Coop control, Mountail Dew
Painted dolphin, she say she love me
That's the Molly talking!
Soulja Boy, keep a guapaholic
I'm a guapaholic, shopaholic
Make a movie, I love Fendi, love Gucci
She can't have it, she wanna do me

(Outro)
Turn up the jug
Make it play, make it play
All day, out of space
Ya niggas tear it up, man
Let's get it!
Cuban Link the album, Cuban Link everything, turn up
Cuban Link, diamond, rubies
Cuban Cuban
Stupid
Dre
Loud
Big Soulja
