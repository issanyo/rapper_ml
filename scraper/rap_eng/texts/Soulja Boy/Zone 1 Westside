[Hook]
A hundred thousand cash stuffed in my Gucci bag
Walk inside the trap I got gas, I got swag
[?] never heard of that
[?] and lil drako shooter gone murder that
Drako Obama you know it got kickback
I got your bitch, come get your bitch back
Slide through the city, you know that I'm getting it
I got the stick on me, know I'm a real street nigga
Ride through the city I wet it up, dipping
Fuck on your bitch yea that lil bitch be missing
Zone 1 my nigga I ran up a ticket
Gucci and Louis, Burberry my fist
I got some niggas that's whipping up fish in the kitchen
Fuck with drako and your body be missing

[Verse 1]
Young Drako nigga, I am real street nigga
Came up from rapping and trapping, drug dealing
I ran up a million my nigga
I bust down the Rollie and VVS all in my ice my nigga
I live that life I pay that price my nigga
I trap cocaine and shoot dice lil nigga
I bust down the Rollie with ice lil nigga
I tatted my face cuz I made that 30 mill nigga
Stand in the trap and I post in the trenches
With real trap niggas, professional drug dealers
Pablo Escobar they treat me like a villain
At the end of the day they still was my niggas
Tony Montana chilling on a villa
Thriller my jacket and Michael Jackson zipper
Hop out the cut with my shooter get to hitting
Young Drako nigga you know I'm in trenches
Ran up a quarter million, cop a Bentley
Slide through the city, they know that I'm really getting it
Stacks on deck money gang, that's my gang lil nigga
Pull on your block with the choppa start hitting
Hit the show and trapped out the bale for real
I don't play that shit nigga we trap with that steel
12 gauge blow his back through his ear
I'm smoking dope in the back of the fair
