[Hook]
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

[Verse 1]
I’m tryn’ to break the bank fuck you niggas think
Pull up in that Bentley customize the paint
Lean in the sink I’m doing what you can’t
Nigga say they getting money but I know they ain’t
Throw up in the sink, pouring up my drink
Came out the water put that 9 in your face
50 thousand dollars made my lawyer beat the case
It ain’t really nothing shoot that nigga in his face
Bitches love the taste, niggas say your Grace
Grind through the hood Gucci on my shoelace
Bitch I’m outta space money by the case
I ain’t got no suit, but I got a suitcase

[Hook]
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

[Verse 2]
I’m tryin’ to break the bank who really can do it like this
Who really can do it like me in the streets we’re 50 Cents
In the studio with Lil Twist I’m riding around on your bitch
I’m stunting on you bitch you niggas can’t do it like this
I swag since ever since ’07 that’s not on my deal
That was like 5 years, 2012 I’m outta here
2013 my year, I do this with no fear
I look in the hater face and ask what do we have here?
It’s Soulja, it’s Soulja
I’m riding around in Range Rovers
I’m pulling up in Ferarris , I’m yelling diamond shorty
I’m sipping lean and Bacardi remember I’m the shooter of the party
I really don’t go retarded, get me started I go hardest

[Hook]
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)
