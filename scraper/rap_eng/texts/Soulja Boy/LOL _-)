[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Shorty just text me, says she want to sex me
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face
Shorty sent a twit pic, saying come and get this
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Shorty called my phone, I was busy
Cruising in that Benz 'round the city
Then I felt my phone buzz, I know that she like thugs
I'm a bad boy like Diddy, that that
Then she sent a text that read, "Baby, I'm at home"
Then she sent another one that says she's all alone
So I text her a smiley face and said let's do the grown
She said, "LOL, boy you crazy, come on"
Then she said, "Actually, you ain't gotta ask me"
Sent the little face with the tongue 'cause I'm nasty
I'm on my way, girl, I can't wait
Twitter me a picture, let me see that, okay

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Shorty just text me, says she want to sex me
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face
Shorty sent a twit pic, saying come and get this
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face
Go to my page and follow
And if you got a body like a Coke bottle
Shorty sent a twit pic, saying come and get this
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
See now my shorty text me, sent your boy a smiley face
Gucci Mane X-rated, we could make a sex tape
Pics on my iPhone, Gucci on her iPod
When she turn around, ass make me say, "Oh God"
Mommy real beautiful, manicured cuticles
Office job, student girl, holdin' down her cubicle
And she got my number, tell her man that's like a miracle
Said she like my swag, pull up 6's on my vehicle
GA to VA, Cali girl, love me
Brooklyn girls hug me, Miami girls sexy
Pull up in a stretchy, Jean Paul flexin'
First date sexin', next night Texas

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, LOL smiley face
Baby girl sent the picture to my BlackBerry
She fine and she thick, just like Halle Berry
Kiss me through the phone, LOL smiley face
We can go and kick it babe, later on at my place
She message me on MySpace, told me she loved me
She textin' my phone 4:30 in the mornin'
Baby I'm horny, I wanna kiss you
I can put it on you, that's not an issue
She scratchin' my back screamin' out I'm hers
She text my phone said, "I need your love"
I met her Monday last week in the club
One week later, now she tellin' me that she in love ha

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Shorty just text me, says she want to sex me
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face
Shorty sent a twit pic, saying come and get this
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face

And if you got a body like a Coke bottle
Shorty sent a twit pic, saying come and get this
LOL smiley face, LOL smiley face

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
She sending picture messages, getting so affectionate
Contents sexual, she like to call textual
So I get the coupe clean, she my little boo thing
When I arrive, we get live like UStream
And we gone get it on, until I get her off
And when she get up on, it's so hard to get her off
As soon as I be gone, she back up on my phone
804-335-0051

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Shorty just text me, says she want to sex me
