Soulja Boy tell 'em, Gucci this, Louie that, all out your fucking speaker
When it time for that beef, strap with that desert eagle
I get a new chain every fucking Tuesday
Fuck nigga tryna snatch it, it's gon' be his doomsday
Arab J-bar, playboy, 3-50
Pull up in my Lambo, call that bitch Gotham city
Don't get it fucked up, I been had hoes
I been had haters and I been doing shows (bitch)
I had tall stacks for a muthafucking rap chick
High School, crowned in my locker bitch
Hoes going crazy for the Leo DeAndre
Gucci, Louie, Dolce Gabbana
Hey bitch

[Verse 2]
Hey it's your muthafucking boy 350
You better not trip, I'll buss your fucking lip
Ey yep muthafucking boy run and tell that
Buss your muthafucking hand with that fall back
Bounce fool jump boy, endless fucking trap boy
Coming through to the squad, got that muthafucking toy
Not a toy, not a game, branded pain, Melvin lane
Got the chain, go them thangs, got them fucking roll...

[Chorus]
