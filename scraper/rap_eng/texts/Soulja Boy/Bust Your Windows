I bust the windows out your car
And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car, hey
After I saw you looking right at her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn...

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you felt, when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when...
You see, you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile
Ha ha ha ha

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car, hey
You should feel lucky that that's all I did
After five whole years of this bullsh...
Gave you all of me and you played with it
Ooh ohh...

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't think that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when...
You see, you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

Bust windows out your car
But it don't comfort to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until that happens, baby, you don't know pain

Ooh (Yeah I did it)
You should know it (You should know it)
I ain't sorry (I ain't sorry)
You deserved it (You deserved it)
After what you did to me (After what you did)
You deserved it (You deserved it)
I ain't sorry (I ain't sorry)
No no no... (I ain't sorry)

(You broke my heart, so I broke your car)
You caused me pain
(You caused me pain, so I did the same)
Even though all that you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt, yeah
Oh, but why am I still cryin'?
Why am I the one whose still cryin'?

Oh oh, you really hurt me baby
You really you really hurt me baby
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey...
Now watch me, you
Now watch me

I bust the windows out your car
