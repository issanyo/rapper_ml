[Intro]
Soulja Boy Tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Wake up out my sleep, it's time to start another day
Soulja Boy, how many albums did you go and sell today? (Boy Tell'em)
SBeezy, the truth is what I'm telling
Got this clown dissing me, but where is his album selling? (Boy Tell'em)
I'm doing interviews addressing all these critics
Tryna underrate me, saying I ain't got no lyrics (Boy Tell'em)
Three times platinum, yeah I broke the record
If you can't respect that, tell me what is you respecting?

[Chorus]
Dudes rocking Yums fades 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
Blowing up they MySpace page 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
Got 'em yelling out the A 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)

Repping S.O.D. Money Gang 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
The superman what they crank 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
They got they names on they shades 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)

[Verse 2]
(Boy Tell'em) I spit harder, I spit fire
We tell them old washed up rappers to retire (Boy Tell'em)
Tryna copy my technique on your album
It's time to crank it up, yeah let's turn up the volume
The rap game? Don't get me started
My lyrics get recycled but your lyrics just garbage (Boy Tell'em)
For you to get a hit, you need a feature
I'm solo every track, still comin' out yo speakers

[Chorus]
Dudes rocking Yums fades 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
Blowing up they MySpace page 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
Got 'em yelling out the A 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)

Repping S.O.D. Money Gang 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
The superman what they crank 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
They got they names on they shades 'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
'cause (Soulja Boy Tell'em)
