[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm back at it again
And this one right is here top 10
Diddy boppin' in the club, you know I get it in
Ain't know how much that I spent
Wake up in the morn, do it again
Free all my homies out the pen
Yeah, you know that I'm the man
On my chain, it's yellow, a 100 grand
I don't gotta brag about the money
I can still swag without the money
I took off on the haters, they lookin' funny
Do not move but the money
You must think I'm a dummy
You know I'm gettin' money
My peers gettin' old
So I pulled up in a ghost
Eattin' shrimp and calamari
I might go buy me a Bugatti
My money fettuccine and my pockets on sloppy
I got girls in the lobby
I gotta get it, boy you playin'
I got the world in my hand
Boulevard 20 mil, pinky ring 20 grand
Do you dig what I sayin'?

[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop

[Verse 2]
You can't do it like me
So don't do it like me
I took your girlfriend, yeah, you know that she a freak
I can have a different girl every week
I be get it boppin' in my sleep
Gettin' money, tone heat
I take the Lamborghini and I swerve it through the streets
BT, SOD
I'm swaggin' out the loft and
I had to shake the hatters off me
And this my new dance
I might spend all of my advance
I'm chillin' up in France
Ditty boppin' with my mans
You can tell that I'm the man, you know I got a plan
She love the way I dance


[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
