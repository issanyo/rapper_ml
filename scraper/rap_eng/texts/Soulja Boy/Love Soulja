Bottles we pourin up, jesus piece frozed up

You niggas ain’t get money like sod, so just close it up

These bitches love soulja, money we throwin
Bottles we pourin up, jesus piece frozed up
Rolex, hold it up, drink lately, throwin up
You niggas ain’t get money like sod, so close it up

I pulled up and in a mulsane, tatted up like lil wayne
Party catch like bergman, black bentley swerve man
Hold up your runnin man, where is your rollie man?
I don’t see your rollie man, you gotta have a rollie man
You ain’t swaggin, pull some, throwin up some gang size
I rock it in this pocket, i close my eyes see dollar signs
Maserati parked in front, paid it like taxes
I don’t do the actin, i do it for the ratchets
I got mo money than these motherfuckin actors
You think that you know us, 3 mill on my tour bus
Keep that kush smoking, keep that molly rolling
Keep that lean pouring and keep that cash flowin

These bitches love soulja, money we throwin
Bottles we pourin up, jesus piece frozed up
Rolex, hold it up, i drink lean until i’m throwin up
You niggas ain’t get money like sod, so just close it up

These bitches love soulja, money we throwin
Bottles we pourin up, jesus piece frozed up
Rolex, hold it up, drink lately, throwin up
You niggas ain’t get money like sod, so close it up

Sod got cash bitch, 200 in the stash bitch
400 in my new bitch, 100 in my last bitch
And i’m smoking gas bitch, you gotta be a bad bitch
You heard what i said ho, you gotta be a bad bitch
If you ain’t got no ass bitch, then i cannot smash this
Man you got me laughin, catch him up in traffic
Sod, we stackin, all them pistols packin
You knowing where the beez is, soulja boy fa real

These bitches love soulja, money we throwin
Bottles we pourin up, jesus piece frozed up
