I was 11 years old, I was running with the pack
12 years old, I saw them niggas couldn't crack
I'm looking at the plate, thinking what the fuck is that
I kept hitting up on the corner and I bring me back a sack
Bring me back a sack, bring me back a sack
I kept hitting up on the block and I bring me back a sack
Bring me back a sack, bring me back a sack
I got caught up on the corner, bring me back a sack

[Verse 1]
Bring me a sack, bring me back a vote
I just bought a Tesla, what the fuck you thought
I do this for real, I trap everyday
I got money in the west and in fucking east
I'm in beast mode, west to east coast
Chopper hit ya then [?] get ready though
You don't want no beef with Soulja, that I know
I hit ya up for your place into the fucking floor
