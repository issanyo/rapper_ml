[Intro- Soulja Boy]
I'm in the booth with marijuana eyes
Uh, Soulja Boy Tellem, uh
I love females who like to wear their toes out
Call me a fire hydrants, I bring them hoes out
I got a lot of people want whats hanging from neck
Call me what you want, just don?t call me collect
Tell me whats the deal, what to do with this beef shit
Say fuck me on youtube and when you see me you didn't do shit I don't believe you rappers, who you kidding dog
Save your lame game for your muthafucking memory cards

[Trey Songz - Hook]
I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful

[Verse One- Soulja Boy]
Hip Hop is like school yeah I had to learn it
Beef is like a blank disc yeah I had to burn it
They finally showing me respect but I had to earn it
I'm heading to the finish line ain't got no time for U-turns
Today I realized I am not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be Great
You fall down seven times you stand up eight
Realize true happiness lies inside of you
Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds sing after the muthafucking storm gone
If you want to sing, you can always sing this song
Turn my swag on is my theme song
Theres a 95% chance that it used to be your ringtone
I got swiss in the cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted in my neck they love my vocals

[Trey Songz - Hook]

[Verse Two- Soulja Boy]
As I sit back and spit this crack
I leak it on the internet and watch my haters react
Fifty said they can't read between the lines
So I jab uppercut punch line after punch line
Know your thinking damn Soulja going hard right now
And I'm thinking damn, this is just a star right now
Soulja Boy is gone on the renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade

[Trey Songz - Hook]

[Soulja Boy talking]
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future
Thats real shit
Beezy, Soulja Boy Tell'Em
All my DJ's play this shit back to back

[Trey Songz - Hook]
