I walk inside the club, I got lean, I got Act
Fuck with me Shawty and I won't even text
SOD, Money Gang, we done broke the bank
Rich Gang, Soulja Boy be blowin on this thing
Ridin through the city and my cup full of drink
In my Ferrari and it got that candy paint
Ridin foreign whips and I stay getting cash
IPhone 5, they can't bring me all my racks
Smoking on that kush and I stay spending stacks
They say the bank closed, well I open up the racks
Walk inside the vault, I see bands, I see rings
Walk inside this club, I spend bandz, I spend grands
Million dollars niggas, catch me on my tour bus
Million dollar niggas, hunned dollars for a haircut

[Verse 2:]
Stuntin is a habit, I'm in love with racks
I'm in love with cash, I love to hit licks
Ridin with that iPhone5 talkin bricks

Flexin like a bitch, Soulja Boy don't move sloppy
I just hit a lick, time to cop that Bugatti
Ridin with that new choppa

Bracelet on my wrist cost a chicken (damn)
Catch me in my condo water whippin (damn)
Soulja Boy in love with that gold shit (damn)
Soulja Boy be flexin you rock old shit (damn)

Flexin through the hood, I hit licks all the time
Bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks on that low
Bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks ran from above

[Hook:]
