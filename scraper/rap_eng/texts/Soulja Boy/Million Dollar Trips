[Hook]
Ridin in a new foreign whip
You a fuck boy nigga, I'll empty out the clip
In that drop-top wraith, smokin' dope I'm wit' the shit
I empty out the Draco know I keep the thirty-clip
Right wrist cost fifty, know my bracelet worth a brick
I'm in the kitchen with the chickens know I'm water whippin' shit
I'm havin' bricks of the Actavis, two hunned' for a zip
I be hustlin' every day I'm takin' million dollar trips

[Verse 1]
Million dollar trips, in and out I'm hand to hand
Trigger finger off the draco, his bitch is my biggest fan
If you disrespect draco we gon' air it out again
I'm havin bricks, I'm havin Pesos, niggas know I'm gettin' it in
And I jumped out that coupe, bitch I'm bout to whip a ten
I'm havin' birds, havin' pigeons, havin' chickens, havin' hens
Last nigga tried draco, he won't do that shit again
I'm in the kitchen whippin' bricks nigga, jumpin' out the gym
Ballin' on these fuck niggas, I just broke the rim
I'm in that I-8, that 30 on my lap I really dip
The draco shooters, they pull up, pop yo ass just like a pill
And if you really know big soulja, I been rich before the deal
(Gang!)

[Verse 2]
Front do' broad day with the draco
Really cappin' hard for the Pesos
Bad bitch fell in love with my lingo
I'm havin' the plug out in Puerto Rico
Black machine gun, shoot through the peephole
Cuban link, 30 below zero
Pinkie ring, it be sub-zero
Shoot with the FNN then I reload
Sell a brick, get it gone pronto
I whip up a brick, wit' the pint, servin' combos
In the kitchen, hit the pot with my elbow
Mini mac-11 make a drumroll
Runnin' wit that sack, I can't fumble
Puttin' cocaine in the figure fold
I came up from trappin' and cappin' on Simpson Road
Two M's stashed at the bando
Bathin' ape, ski mask at the front do'
Run up the M's, they already know
Swerve in the bentley coupe down figaro
Drop the top wit' the draco, then I reload
Hollow tips, keep a lotta ammo
Lay in a nigga grass like I'm rambo
Draco bullets burn like a candle
Soulja boy telecommando
