Step inside the club fresh from head to toe
Hit my bird walk and den I'm messin' wit my merry-go
When I'm in the D-town, Dallas, wassup bro?
When I'm in da A-pull pally, what happenin' folk?
When I'm in Chicago, they hollerin'
Now wassup Joe?
Now I'm back to Mississippi they telling me
Wassup mayne?
Heading [?] Memphis, Tennessee
They telling me da same thing
Wen I'm in New York
Was good sun? I'm just hustlin'
