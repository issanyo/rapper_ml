[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Hey, woke up this morning - got a face tat
Blowin' on that loud, that's that kush pack
Bust the scripts at the pharmacy, gettin Ack
Sold out shows, got the lines packed

[Interlude: ASAP Ant]
Blowin gunk what ya'll doin' man
Rockin' with DJ Nick man
YG at it, what it do?
We in the fuckin' trenches doin' what we doin'
Runnin' around the (?)
Blowin' on that gunk

[Hook: Peewee Longway & Soulja Boy x2]

[Verse 1: ASAP Ant]
Woke up this mornin' - got a face tat
Ya'll niggas (?)
Sippin' this lean, can't make a boat of the shit that I did
Rollin' the blunts, nothing but kush, there is no mid
High as a plane, eyes low, floss your friend
Instagram flexing, niggas, killas (?)
Momma said, slow it down before you eat a dick
Poppin' them zans, spillin' them bands
(?) got shot when I land
Whippin' the crack in the (?) of your 'Lac
Black (?) cash
They call me little face tat
Money on the table like black-jack
Hoes around the corner got the line packed
Millions sold (?) lames attract the (?)
