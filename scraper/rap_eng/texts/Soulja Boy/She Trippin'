[Hook]
Man that ho trippin
Man she trippin, man she trippin
Man this ho trippin, she ain’t on nothing
I be riding through the city, know you see me stunting
Man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin

[Verse 1]
I walk inside the club my ice dripping
I ain’t stand that ho cause she trippin
I’m blowing on this loud you get missing
Me and my clique man we with it
I step inside the club, I be balling
Yeah I be balling like spalding
I got a lot of money calling
And I got a lot of cash falling
Know what the team, zan with the lean
9 with the bean

[Hook]
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin
I be riding through the city, see me stunting on these girls
Say they wanna get with me
Man that ho trippin...

[Verse 2]
See I ain’t got no time, cause I be on my grind
Young hood nigga, let me hit that from behind
I'm sippin lean and my rum’s on rewind
You know wassup, I ain’t trynna to wine and dine
I’m in the hood, just lookin' for the dime
You know what's good, I ain’t even in my prime
Sod gang, I ain’t even gotta rhyme
Stunting so hard man I do this all the time
All of this juice got it came from the pack
And I fall in the club, and you know I got the sack

[Hook]
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin
Man that ho trippin, man that ho trippin

[Outro]
