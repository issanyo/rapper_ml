(Nope) I ain't no sucker
I ain't no sucker (nope) I ain't no sucker (nope)
I ain't no sucker (nope) it ain't no punk in me (nope)
It ain't no punk in me (nope) it ain't no punk in me (nope)
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop
I ain't no sucker so don't play me like no lollipop

[Verse One]
Lights off steady poppin steady jockin off of me
It's ya folk Soulja Boy, comin straight from the streets
It's goin off, grill in my mouth, represent the South
Let me show you where I'm from, let me tell you what I'm 'bout
Listen what I'm sayin I ain't playin listen up to me
Get your facts straight before you other rappers step to me
It's a fact that I was next to blow I used to rep the name
Everythang I said came true cause they thought I was playin

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Nawww I heat 'em hate cold when I hit the mic
They be like, that's the one who gon', get the club hype
Peep game, I got a nice slang, leave it up to me
Stoppin Soulja Boy movement, N-O-P-E
Got the internet callin me the K-I-N-G
Look at me, on the TV screen, can you believe it
They askin me, is hip-hop layin in the coffin
You sayin hip-hop dead, well I'm a dead man walkin

[Hook]

NAWWWWWWW~!
