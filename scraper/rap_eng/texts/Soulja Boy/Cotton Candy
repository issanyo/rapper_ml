[Chorus]
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding

[Verse]
Whip, whip, whip, whip, one more time (whip)
Skrrt-Skrrt with the thirty and I let it slide (blaow)
Porsche Panamera when I pull up in new ride
Slide with the draco, those niggas can't come outside
Yeah-Yeah, I'ma just cash out the bank
Yeah, I'm puttin' the racks in a safe
I'ma just go catch a play
I'm pullin' up with K's, all of my niggas gon' spray
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, just wiped out the bank

[Chorus]
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy (uh)
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding
