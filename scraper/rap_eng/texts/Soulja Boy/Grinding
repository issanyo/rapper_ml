[INTRO]
This for all my niggas out there getting money
Fuck a hater, let's get it

[Hook]

[Verse 1:Soulja Boy]
Motherfucker don't play with me
Came out the water with a fucking pistol
I'm too official, niggas talking shit
But I'm taking off just back a missile
Niggas talking shit, next day he missing
Nigga dissin' he's a bitch nigga
You a fuck nigga got no loyal
Came out the ground just like oil
Niggas talking shit, but where I'm found
Nigga up in Bay Town
With a bad bitch that's gon' suck me up
And a chopper holds like eighty rounds
Pussy nigga don't want beef
Nigga knock out your fucking teeth
Tattoos in my V neck
DJ Khaled we the best
Money roll like marijuana
Bitch I'm up in California
Niggas talking that fuck shit
Until a nigga run up on 'em
Soulja tell 'em I'm the truth
Bitch you know I got the juice
Bitch I grind everyday
Mother fuck that shit I'm getting paid

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Agoff]

My swag makes the haters sick

Coming hard like a hundred bricks
Look like I hit a hundred leeks

Twenty twelve I'm going in
At golf I'm born to win

[Hook]
