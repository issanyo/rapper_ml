[Hook]
Hold it down for my team
I came from trapping to serving them [?]
Jump out the jet and my wrist clean
Hit a lick till my bitches on lean
20 pounds of that cali green
Maserati like a tezenis
And if one these fuck niggas talk bout robbin me
Mini Draco on me and make a tragedy
Had to hold it down for the team
Had to hold it down for the team
I came from trappin and cappin on things
In Zone 1 they treat me like a king
Ok, fuck with Dre is a killing spree
To my bitch on the shopping spree
Hit the plug for 100 a Ps
This fuck nigga gon remember me

[Verse]
Ripping my wrist till it bleeds
Smoking gelato, I'm hanging with the OG's
40,000 for my ring
Regular patek bust down AP
Mini Draco and make a tragedy
Hit the private jet with 250G
In a bugatti with a felony
Runnin from 12 I know they after me
Switchin to sixth gear you know Im flyin man
Pick up the pack in an audi like i am iron man
Hop out the coupe with arm, man
But playin' with Soulja, the draco bullets start flyin'
I got niggas that love hatin since weve been babies
Bust down particularly, hit me for the 80
Put a 30 in a Draco and then '0380
I stand in the kitchen, my track going crazy
I rerocked a brick bought my bitch a mercedes
I got shooters that love hatin, babies in the Vegas
I bet a 100k, I know that they hate it
Dray him my phone, say to the nigga, "We made it."
