Hook:
I'm smoking and I'm drinking
Gold all in my bracelet
I'm the shit these hoes must face it
I popped a molly I must face it x2

Verse 1:
I popped a molly I must face it
I got diamonds all in my bracelet
If she fine then I gotta taste it
Tell her pour it up don't waste it
I'm in the hood just chilling with my kinfolks
They say this shit sound like nintendo
See I popped a molly im focused
Say I hit the blunt and I'm rolling
I'm smoking and I'm drinking
I'm outta space I'm wasted
These hoes niggas is hating
But I'm getting money bitch face it

Hook:

Verse 2:
I'm outta space in my spaceship

I sip the lean, I taste it
She suck my dick she naked
Look at these haters faces

I'm Soulja Boy I'm famous
I'm smoking straight lean
So high feel like I'm in a dream
I'm smoking, I'm not focused

I'm sipping lean bitch don't waste it
You know its gold in my bracelet
