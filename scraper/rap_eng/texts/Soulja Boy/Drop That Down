[Intro]
Yeah, down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, down
(Yeah, yeah)
Down, down, down, down
(Yeah, yeah)
Down, down, down, down
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me
You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that

[Verse 1]
I'm in the club, I'm in the buildin'
10 bottles in, screamin' "I'ma kill them"
[?]
Better get your girl, homie, [?]
Yeah, the team with me, the campaign
Double cup, shawty, I do the damn thang
When I'm in the club, tell her drop that down
When I'm in the club, tell her it's goin' down
That's how big my team, we be so supreme
Yeah, I'm in the middle, it's a movie scene
100 bottles of Ros√©, yeah, I'm in this thing
I'm the first king
That's on everything

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me
You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down (leggo, leggo)
Drop that down, drop that

[Verse 2]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 yellow bones
Standin' in the club, I don't wanna go home
50 bottles in and you know I'm in my zone
A king on my throne, tell a hater leave me alone
Uh, talkin' bottles of Patron
Shawty took a shot, now she callin' him [?]
Real talk, I can show you how we roll
Welcome to my city, put the girl on a stroll
Real talk, boy, I got diamonds in my chain
Everybody round here know the boy name
I'm reppin', rockin' fame, 20 bottles in
2012, year we finna win

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me
You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that

[Verse 3]
Yo, it's the third verse killer
Shawty in the club, I'ma go ahead and fill her
Your swag's ill but my swag's iller
Your girl right beside me and later I'ma drill her
Yeah, money tall as a pillar
Michael Jackson jacket so I'm feelin' like Thriller
Dudes talk real well, I'ma talk realer
I smoke a lot of weed like my name Mac Miller
High in the cloud like I'm on a propeller
Album came out and it was a best seller
Money on deck, plus the bar is like a cellar
SODMG check, you're a good speller

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me
You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that

[Outro]
Drop that down
You already know why we're in this club tonight
Girl, stop playin' with me
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
Stop playin' with me
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
Girl, stop playin' with me
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
Stop playin' with me, girl
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
