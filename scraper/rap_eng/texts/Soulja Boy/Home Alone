[Chorus]
Ay my chain, and my watch, and my ring so cold
Fuck your bitch on the west, took her to the North Pole
All my diamonds on my neck, keep a young nigga froze
You could tell by my whip, that a young nigga on
And these badass bitches keep blowin' up my phone
I'm in a big mansion, like Home Alone
Huh, styrofoam
Huh, two cups, I'm gone
Huh, ridin' in the Lamb, huh, skrrt-skrrt, huh

[Verse 1]
Ay, you could tell by a nigga drip
I could fuck on your bitch
He got that FNN
And it stay on my hip, so nigga don't slip
If I catch you in the club, we gon shoot up the VIP

[Chorus]
Ay my chain, and my watch, and my ring so cold
Fuck your bitch on the west, took her to the North Pole
All my diamonds on my neck, keep a young nigga froze
You could tell by my whip, that a young nigga on
And these badass bitches keep blowin' up my phone
I'm in a big mansion, like Home Alone
Huh, styrofoam
Huh, two cups, I'm gone
Huh, ridin' in the Lamb, huh, skrrt-skrrt, huh

[Verse 2]
I be like, fuck 12, go on and catch the case (aye)
I just called my lawyer like, here go 50K (aye)
Slide in that Bentley, now I'm in a lane (aye)
Try to pull me over, I'ma skrrt this bitch today (aye)
I just made it rain on a bad bitch (hey)
I just keep that 30 like a street savage (aye)
Born in Chiraq, I ain't have shit
Aye, keep that FNN, I'll let this bitch spray

[Chorus]
Ay my chain, and my watch, and my ring so cold
Fuck your bitch on the west, took her to the North Pole
All my diamonds on my neck, keep a young nigga froze
You could tell by my whip, that a young nigga on
And these badass bitches keep blowin' up my phone
I'm in a big mansion, like Home Alone
Huh, styrofoam
Huh, two cups, I'm gone
Huh, ridin' in the Lamb, huh, skrrt-skrrt, huh

[Verse 3]
Feel my watch to my chain, damn a young nigga cold
I just fucked your bitch, took her to the North Pole
Earring, golfball, keep a nigga froze (aye)
You could tell from my whip that I'm on (aye)
Nigga said that he wants smoke
Pulled up to his momma house, to her front door
I'm at the front door, let that chopper blow
Nigga what you mean?
Keep an AK, with the mufuckin' beam
Xan with the lean (aye)
Percs with the Sprite (aye)
Ridin' in the whip (aye)
Skrrt all night (aye)
I just sold a brick (aye)
Catch me with that pipe (aye)
If a nigga try to rob, he gon lose his life (aye)

[Chorus]
Ay my chain, and my watch, and my ring so cold
Fuck your bitch on the west, took her to the North Pole
All my diamonds on my neck, keep a young nigga froze
You could tell by my whip, that a young nigga on
And these badass bitches keep blowin' up my phone
I'm in a big mansion, like Home Alone
Huh, styrofoam
Huh, two cups, I'm gone
Huh, ridin' in the Lamb, huh, skrrt-skrrt, huh
