Question of the day - why do niggas hatin me?
Because I pulled up in Mercedes that was AMG
All black 22, tinted like I tall cat
Get yo' ass smashed quick, whip that fuckin ball back
Ran around town what's the word in my neighborhood
Grape's in the air so we really don't care
Ain't no hollerin WOO~! Like my name Ric (la) Flair
Say we gettin money yeah and I am not snatchin on no hair
It's cash everywhere, in the stash, in the chair
I got cash in the dash, and this passed in the air
As I pass off to Kurt, smokin herb bitch you heard
What's the word in my crew? You get flipped like a bird
And I'm dooze off the roof seduce twenty off my cake
Man damn I'm the shit, man pass me that cake yeah
Young Dre, man call me a boss
Cortez in this bitch, S.O.D. break 'em off
