[Intro]
Ayy what it do man?
It's your boy Soulja Boy
I got a new dance for y'all, it's called "Hit 'em with the draco"
Ayy 50 Cent what you talking about?
You made all that money off Vitamin Water and then filed for bankruptcy
You know I'ma knock Chris Brown out when I see him

[Chorus]
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco

[Verse]
So fresh when I walk up in the building
I just a bought a new mansion and it got Versace ceilings
This PCE SOD and you know we killing (Money Team)
And I swear that this year I'ma make some millions
And step through the door so fresh
Look at the diamonds on my neck
Everybody know I'ma flex

Everybody know I'ma get to the cake
You on the block, I'ma hit you with the draco
You know that I put it in they face
Break it down to the ground, yeah

All this money up on me
And the money is climbing
Money taller than a mountain

When I step in the [?]
Hit 'em with the draco one time
Hit 'em with the draco two times
Stand in the box, I jab I jab

Lot of money on my neck
Riding round with a check

Then I take it to the south
I got diamonds in my mouth
I got dogs in the house
Pitbulls on the couch
Lot of money in your face
Yeah we getting to the money
Hit 'em with the draco straight in his face

[Chorus]
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
Hit 'em with the draco, hit 'em with the draco
