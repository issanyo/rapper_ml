[Intro]
Bow!.. Skrt... You know what the fuck going on nigga..  Ugh!

[Verse]
Stand in the trap I'm breaking my wrist
Came up from three bricks
I walk in the trap designer my kicks
Bussdown Rollie wrist
Step out the whip margiela my fit
In the trap cut up a brick
Pull up get to dumping that stacks on deck money gang shit
I fell in love with breaking my wrist
Put Yeezy's on my feet and I hit lick
Slide through the city Mac-11 hollow tips
Stacks on deck money gang we on that shit
I hop out the rarri they copy the drip
I jump out the jet then bag up a brick
Run up on gang you gon get hit
I fell in love with whipping' my wrist
Zone 1 money gang on fuck shit
Stacks on deck money gang what I claim we with the shit
Pull up on you let the whole thing hit
I'm on the highway with 250 bricks
Chillin in mansion, new residence
Young nigga street nigga play with dead presidents
In the trap cook up the dope with no evidence
I play with the pack and the medicine
I play with the pack and the sack and its evident
Got a brick in the trunk like an elephant
Came up from serving that medical
Truck-load of money I got to go shovel it
Run up a M&M then I double it
Stacks on deck money gang pull up we bussing shit
I pull to the trap and I pull up with stupid bricks
VVS diamonds I Ice out my whole wrist
