[Shout outs]

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' n cappin' i'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot

[Verse 1]
Sittin in the trap, money in my face
Trappin' n cappin' i'm switching from state to state
Mansion or condo I switch up the low case
100 thousand cash just for motivation
Jumped out the Wraith, then I hop in the i8
Derek Jeter, hit the pot like I beat the case
Pulled out a pistol, I shot with a K
Money get shooter and they poppin' shit broad day
1 M, I just made it today
Came up from trappin' n cappin'
I ate everything on the plate
Smokin' on rocks, now I'm high in space
Call up my lawyer, you know he gon' beat the case
Got the Draco, know we shoot with the 38
Grippin' the rocket, I know that these niggas fake
Ferragamo on me, rockin the Gucci snake
Pull out the draco, he shot in the face

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got the guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' n cappin' i'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I come from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot


[Verse 2]
Big Soulja, i'm the big homie
Mini Draco, gotta keep it on me
I came up from trappin' n cappin', they act like they know me
Put the bricks in a figure-four
I stand at your front door, ski mask with the Draco
Who wanna bih' homie, shoot when I say so
Came up from trappin' n cappin' for pesos
150 bricks down Santiago
2018, Bentley truck Forgiato
Trappin' n cappin' M's in Wells Fargo
Bricks coming in, swipe em by barcode
Trappin' n cappin' i'm smokin' Gelato
100 pounds, nigga hit the lotto
Givenchy on me, I'm fly Aeropostale
Flip it like Future, this shit get colossal
Hop in the Lamborghini, full throttle!

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got the guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' n cappin' i'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I come from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
