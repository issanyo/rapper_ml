(Zaytoven)
Yeah, Soulja
Live from the studio Hollywood but I'm from the trap West Side
Zone one where ya at, uh

(Hook)
Zaytoven where ya at, uh
Big Soulja where ya at, uh
Soulja Boy I'm taking over uh
Pull up to the club ten chains on my neck
Riding round town and I'm sitting in a 'Vette
Got a lot of money yeah I got a lot of checks
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm King Soulja, hey, how ya doing?
Ten chains on my neck with some Patrick Ewing's
I be fresh as fuck when I'm on the red carpet
Smoking on this kush taking off like a rocket
Pretty boy swag but I still got pounds
Riding through the hood, yeah it's going down
Shoutout to Zaytoven [?] told them pass my crown
King Soulja 3 3 D you know I'm in your town
Aye, I'm on tour, selling out the shows
Smoking on this kush, fucking all these hoes
Pouring up this lean and you know just how it goes
Soulja boy been telling em man I be rocking gold
Took over the world and Imma take over the next
Riding through the hood and catch me all up on a jet
Satellite my ears crystal all when I finesse
Flex, big Soulja boy I want another check, ah

(Hook)
