Uhhhhh
Bellman at the door
Can He Get Your Bags
I have fun with you last night baby girl
But you know it just won't last
I done' called you a cab
I gotta go get this cash
I'll be back one day
But the day won't really come to fast
And I ain't tryin' to do you wrong baby girl
Cause you know that you just look so right
We've been at it all night
But I'm about to miss my flight
And i've been chillin', thinkin' to myself woah
Thinkin' where we go, and you already know
I'm at the pent house condo
You chillin' out, starin' with yo friends huh?
Well I'm gon' send them up
Since you keep blowin' my BBM up, girl
Everyday a different girl, Every night a different girl
Everyday a different girl, girl, girl
Every night a different girl, Everyday a different girl
Every night a different girl, girl, girl
Every night a different girl, Everyday a different girl, girl, girl
Girl, Girl, Girl[x4]
Everyday a different girl, Every night a different girl
Girl, girl, girl[x2}
