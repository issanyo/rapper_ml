Man that boy clean. Pull up on the scene (Skrt)

'Cause she know, that Lil Soulja getting money
Pull up and I'm stunting. Chain cost onehunnid
Lamborghini drop top. They know I'm getting money
Shawty all on me. Yeah Lil mama want me
Pouring up that lean, so you know it got me on it
Smoking and I'm on it. Driving in a 'Rari
Lot of money on me. I'm like "Fuck the party."
Throwing money in the club, now she wanna jock me
Throwing hunnids in the club, can't nobody stop me
That that boy Soulja, he be with his gang
Call my jeweler up. I buy a new chain
Shawty on me, she gon' fuck me off the chain
Fucking in the condo. Hop up in the ring

Look at my chain. Look at my ring

[Verse: 2]
Went to the dealership then copped a Audi
Pull up to the club in a new Ferrari (Skrt)
I been getting money throwing all these parties
Getting to the money shout out to to my shawties
Lean in my cup. Gas in my blunt
Pull up to the club, then we shoot it up
Forgiatos on my Lambo I don't give a fuck
I'm getting money in the trap I'm stacking major bucks
I'm hitting it where it hurt. I pull up in that vert
You don't want no beef with me I let my gun squirt
I let my gun jerk. My money do the work
We ain't gotta talk about it. Blow you off the earth
Money in the bank. Pills in the vial
Money coming in. Rappers jump my style
I smoke lean and loud. Not no black and mild
Lean on my blunts. Bitches on my nuts

[Hook]
I'm too clean. I'm too clean
Look at my watch. Look at my ring
I'm too clean. I'm too clean
Look at my watch. Look at my ring
I'm too clean. I'm too clean
I'm too clean. I'm too clean
Look at my chain. Look at my ring
Look at my chain. Look at my ring

[Outro]
