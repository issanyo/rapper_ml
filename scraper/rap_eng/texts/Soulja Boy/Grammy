[Intro]
I done seen a lot of things in my life
I've been in a lot of situations
Y'know that I just think that the world should hear my story
You know I am saying? I think I'm here for a reason
All of what I have obtained so far has been off the strength of me
Y'know grindin so hard and, and stayin so determined
And I just think that, my story has to be heard...

[Intro: Ester Dean]
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?

[Soulja Boy]
Party like a rock star, hit 'em with the hot bars
Fast like a NASCAR, lime like my dad's car
I deserve a Grammy; will I fly away
Or land on Miami? I don't have time to rhyme
But I do have time to grind
S.O.D. pirates, I don't need a hook
My lyrics illustrated verses taken from a book
I understand the fans, supply and demand
Crunk at command, fight and we'll stand
Lyrics from a true legend, livin life through God's blessing
Big papers, long acres, top flight, no security
Black ice on me, call the jury
Yahh trick yahh, and we call it magic
My style may change if you call it drastic
Money so long and we is the measure
I love my business and I love my pleasure
Live now, die later, internet genius
Self proclaimed he a critically acclaimed
For the fortune and fame, he'll run through the rain
For a million in change, takin over the game
18 years old with a drop top Phantom
Kidnap the world 'til they pay my ransom
DeAndre Way, look what's tatted on my face
Fo' words to say - I deserve a Grammy

[Hook: Ester Dean]
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
Is it not good enough?
Am I not good enough?
Have I not gave enough?
What do you want from me?

[Ester Dean]
Tell me what you want

What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
Is it not good enough?
Am I not good enough?
Have I not gave enough?

Tell me what you want from me?
