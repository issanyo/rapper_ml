[Hook]
High school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
Out of high school, trapping out of high school
Out of high school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
You know I was trapping out of high school

[Verse 1]
Out of high school, I was trapping
I was getting the bricks in then I pack 'em
I was water whippin' chickens, 'bout that action
If you try me and my gang you know we blastin'
I was chiefin', yeah I was chiefer
My teacher told me that I smell like reefer
I had 3 phones in my backpack, what you sayin' though
I'm the Soulja Boy, I flex up for no reason

[Hook]
High school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
Out of high school, trapping out of high school
Out of high school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
You know I was trapping out of high school

[Verse 2]
In the 5th grade learned how to cook the dope
In the 6th grade standing at the fucking store
In the 7th grade, shawty I was cuffin' niggas
In the 8th grade Soulja know how to pull a trigger
Now in the 9th grade, I was so paid
I had 100 bands coming in every week
I can't even sleep, I slept right next to my fucking heat
And then in 11th grade I just dropped the heat

[Hook]
High school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
Out of high school, trapping out of high school
Out of high school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
You know I was trapping out of high school
High school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
Out of high school, trapping out of high school
Out of high school, out of high school
Out of high school, trapping out the high school
Look at the diamonds in my ear, they look like ice cubes
You know I was trapping out of high school
