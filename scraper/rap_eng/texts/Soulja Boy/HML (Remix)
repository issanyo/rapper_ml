[Intro]
Prez get that money

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Bad yellow bone, she a freak
Hopped inside the lamb, and I just speed
Diamonds on my neck they like a ski
I just put water on me, freeze me
Diamonds on my neck, I shine one time
I shine two times, I shine three times
When I hit the trap I'm on rewind
Diamonds on my neck a make you blind-blind
Water on my neck, I ran up a check yeah
What a VVS I just had to ice my neck up
Had to run my check up
Had to get my backup
Had to pull a Porsche truck
I just had to act up

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Trapping all up on the phone
Bad bitch won't leave me alone
I'm a superstar
The bitch sucked my dick in a car
The bitch sucked my dick at 12
First one on XXL
Girl got me on her ringtone, bitch might as well
She wanna fuck me, SODMG
I know Soulja Boy, I know Lil B
Top floor, money on fleek
Suck my dick all up on the street
Bank account on fleek, the bitch all on me
Bitch sucking on me, me
Know the BasedGod, know Lil B
Fifty thousand for the sheets
Bank account on fleek
(BasedGod!)

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Tell em hit my line, tell em hit my line
I got all that cash, It ain't hard to find
I didn't smash that girl, it ain't hard to tell
I just got the bread, put it on the scale
I just got the cash, I just got it cake
I just got the cake nigga, got the cake
My niggas at yo face cause you talking crazy
I'm goin' crazy, pull up new Mercedes
I just get it all, I just put the Porsche, and I skert it uh
Brand new Forgiato, eating benihana
Brand new Forgiato, skert it all summer

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line
