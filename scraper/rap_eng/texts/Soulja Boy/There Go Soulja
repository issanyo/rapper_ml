[Intro]
There go Soulja, stacks on deck
There go Soulja, stacks on deck
Stacks on deck
West side! Hey, hey!

[Chorus]
When I ride through the block I be like I told ya
Foreign with that biatch there go soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
I'm riding through the hood and I'm feeling like I told ya
In that foreign whip, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja

[Verse 1]
Yeah, there go Soulja, I'm getting money
Honey, ain't a damn thing funny
I'm in the truck, got that bitch down on me
A nigga try me, then you know that I blow it
Kill him, kill him!
And that pistol's what I'm told aye
I'm in that 'Rari and I'm rolling
I got that Bentley and I roll it
We did a show and I'm on it!
I'm getting high, that's a party
The kush got me high 'til the next morning
Hey! I'm turned up to the maximum
I drop my album in that shit, where the platinums?

[Chorus]
When I ride through the block I be like I told ya
Foreign with that biatch there go soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
I'm riding through the hood and I'm feeling like I told ya
In that foreign whip, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja

[Verse 2]
I picked up a bad bitch in my Rollie
I'm running on the block and I'm frozen
I got that coat like it's October
Niggas hating on the clique, but you know us
And ain't nothing to Lil Soulja
I got this money in my pocket and I blow up (pocket and I blow up)
No husband on me since I blowed up
And I'm sipping on this Lean until I throw up (gang)
What's happening on the cap?
Big cash, stacks on deck, bitch we trappin'
Bow-bow! Right now, man, I'm poppin'
I caught my broski up and he gonna bring the chopper!

[Chorus]
When I ride through the block I be like I told ya
Foreign with that biatch there go soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
I'm riding through the hood and I'm feeling like I told ya
In that foreign whip, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja

[Verse 3]
I can't lie, spent a lot on my Bentley (a lot on my Bentley)
Two hundred fifty, come here with me (two hundred fifty)
I'm flexing through the city (flexing through the city)
Got some True Religion, Louis, Louis, Louis (Louis)
I'm fucking with this Louis shit (Louis shit)
I model up in ninas with these special kicks (special kicks)
Niggas hating on my campaign (hating on my campaign)
I'm getting money bitch you see me in a fast lane
I'm gone
Man, you're hating, it ain't a doubt man (man, you're hating, it ain't a doubt man)
I throw some money on my damn chain (Soulja)
I put some money on my down ring
I get so much money, like I'm selling cocaine!

[Chorus]
When I ride through the block I be like I told ya
Foreign with that biatch there go soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
I'm riding through the hood and I'm feeling like I told ya
In that foreign whip, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
There go Soulja, yeah, there go Soulja
