[Soulja Boy]
New York where we at with it
Money
Forget the comments that they made, we just some young niggas getting paid
I ain't worried bout nothing, nothing I ain't worried bout nothing
Forget the comments that they made, we just some young niggas getting paid
I ain't worried bout nothing, nothing
And these days at red carpets I let my jewellery bling
Stand for some fuck nigga fall for anything
And everyday I hit the block and I make it rain
No, literally bruh I make it rain
Watch the throne mother fucker I'm the last king
Young Soulja Boy came in tag team
Shouts out Lil' B this the new shit
Swag took over the rap game bitch I knew it
I dooze it it and I fucking bruise it get your mind right
Collateral damage when the head hit the mind sight
It's Lil' Dre outta sight nigga outta mind
So I'mma spit the same shit like 20 times
Lil' Dre came in the building to kill and I'm willing
To stack about 30 million
And if you don't believe Google it and see yourself
This [?] won't pool they self, look
Money coming in everyday, yeah you know that I'm on the grind
Welcome to my city I can show you how I get I done gave you your time to shine
We gon' pop bottles in the club and all
20 racks shit we gon' blow it all
Standing in the VIP so I see everybody trying to see a king
I know they just didn't know it right now right now but I ain't worried bout nothing
And when she drop it down on down on down on down and pop itâ€¦
Came up, show respect
Snapback on my head with a S on my chest
I'm the best in the flesh
Young Dre flash bash digital dash in the club with all that cash
Still on deck getting money yeah you know wassup
Every time I pull up man it's like 10 trucks
Black on black followed by another like I'm Obama
Every single time I drop it's a hit in the summer
No droughts over here, we getting to the cake
Hopped up out the bed with the cash in the safe
Money on deck man nobody's safe
20 on my chain man we headed to the safe
Zan with that lean, nothing but Irene
Girls going crazy when I'm on the scene
Racks on the way, busting out them jeans
I keep the camera on me I ain't worried bout a thing
All the bands on me, all the cash on me
All the racks on me, I ain't worried bout a thing
Zan with that lean, nothing but Irene
Hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
