Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool thangs
I'm in a cool type mood I switch them 2 lanes
I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings
24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes

1st verse 
Yall people never have heard of me
Hit them blocks on them 23s
24s when I go and hit the show
Riding clean on boats and you already know
Soulja Boy hit the spot make them bad girls scream
Hit the scene playing slot machines
When I hit the spot in a limousine
On 23s paint candy green and color spreem
Double D thousand hop like a trampoline
Hit the scene and looking clean with my team or with my queen
Already know how I do rock candy red or candy blue
Gettin money I thought you knew
Stand real and stand true
Take a ride in the Cadillac candy black with the seat back
Look at your hair blow in the wind look shawty don't you like that? Take a trip over seas ride clean on double D
Take a ride with Soulja Boy it'll be something you won't believe

Chorus

Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool things
I'm in a cool type mood i switch them 2 lanes
I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings
24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes

Hey I'm a cool type dude I do them cool things
I'm in a cool type mood i switch them 2 lanes
I got ice on my neck, even pinky rings

24 carrot let your hair blow when we switch lanes

2nd verse

I step up on the scene wit my queen
Once again we looking clean
United States all over seas
Man it don't really matter to me
Already know what they trying to do get
Little money they loving you
But when you broke they ain't nothing to you
I mean but when you ain't got noting they ain't stunting you
Said it once said it twice
Anything you name the price
Hit the room cut out the lights
My macking game is locked tight
You know my name know my game know my slang so do your thing
All on ma neck is platinum chain o yea mane i must get fame got damn Ain't got no time time waisted up in this place
Traveling across the globe we go swimming and roller skate
Anythang you wanna do just let me know
I'm right with you
It's parent life that choose a life like that life style to be exact
