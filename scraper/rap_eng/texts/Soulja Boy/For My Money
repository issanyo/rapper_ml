[Hook]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 1]
Been on the block and I got a hundred grand
In the kitchen whippin' up a hundred yams
Strip club, I done bust a hundred bands
Stacks on deck, hell yea we in demand
Going ham, streets going 8 shit
Pull up in that white thing, they goin' crazy
I'm talkin' 20-13, them places is crazy
My young niggas bullin' in that kush and they paid up
Everything paid, everything cashed
I need 25, so we whip the mess
So we with them girls, brought 'em in by Benz
Put them in the van and crack them in the back
It's time to party so we callin' out the freaks
Bein' down the block every day of the week
All music in the streets, all strapped in my chest
That it go out of flex
Flap a date, new finesse

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Been down the block but it cashin'
Pull up to my partner but he talkin' 'bout where it gassin'
Pull up in the Porsche and we had the diggi dash that
Call the spaceship and then nigga I'mma crash that
Rollin' up a bat of that kush and then I ash that
Lookin' at my jury hieroglyphic, it's all abstract
Young Dre, man I go hard, pull up candy paint
Yellow diamonds shawty, VIP
Now we anything
20 bottles later I'm on the pool table
Got like 25 3's and they ready and they able
I'm chilling and I'm wasted
Fuck nothing faded
Young ass nigga cashin' out in Las Vegas
It's whatever, tell him it's whatever
I got 55 bands, we can throw this shit whenever
Pull up and we flexin', yea yea we flexin'
But I've been down the block in the Maserati flexing
