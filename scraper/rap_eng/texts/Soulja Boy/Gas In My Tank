[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Went and dropped 7 hunnid on my Robin jeans
Mix the gas with the lean, call it gas-o-lean
Hittin' play bustin' juug, bitch it's Rich Gang
30 diamonds in my wrist, start my fireflame
Bugs Bunny mad at me, I got all the carats
When I hop out the Ferrari all the bitches starin'
I drive a 'Gatti or the new McLaren
I went and dropped 30 piece on each of my earrings
Double cup while I'm ridin' in my new foreign
I got choppa, I got racks, bitch, yo man borin'
I just step in KOD, all my cash pourin'
Sippin' lean and the Act' and it got me snorin'

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Havin' the plug on the gas
Havin' the plug on the mid
Havin' the plug on the choppa, the beam
Havin' the plug on the six
30k Rollie on my arm
50k VVS diamond my charm
I got the bomb like Osama
Sending my troops overseas like Obama
Hit the pot with the left hook, now they mad at me
When I pull up in that drop, oh yeah, it's that dab daddy
Shooters on go and that's automatic
Bad bitches gettin' too dramatic
Quavo makes movies, I'm cinematic
Lowkey with the fight like the Hidden Dragon

[Verse 3: Offset]
Whippin' the brick, now my hand got that arthritis
Pistol locked up in his mouth, he got gingivitis
Pull up in ghost like Michael Myers
I’m the plug in my city, I got plenty buyers
Soulja keep telling me he got the cipher, the law ticket
I'ma pull up and come get it, my money is tall as a midget
And I got J's, they gon' come back like frisbee's
Certified Keisha (Gas!), you gotta pay me monifa
Loud beatin' loud like a speaker, pull out the choppa and eat'cha
Whippin' the particles, and I got two bricks, they lookin' identical
My plug is an alien, don’t got no tentacles
But he pull up with the batch of the vegetables
You can even come and get you some edibles

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
