[Hook: Lil Cray]
Shawty know that I keep a pole
Everywhere I go know I gotta roll
(Bitch I got that roll on me)
I keep my tool with me just like my wodie aye
He gon' blow for me just like my brodie
(He gon' shoot for me like Boosie)
I'm ballin' on these niggas Kyrie Irving
I might ball on a nigga Kyrie Irving
(I might ball on these niggas)
I'm ballin’ on these niggas Kyrie Irving
I might ball on a nigga Kyrie Irving
(On a nigga Kyrie Irving aye)

[Verse 1: Lil Cray]
When I get that pack I'm Mr. Servin'
All a nigga know is serve like a servant
(All a nigga know is serve)
Shawty blessed me with the top cause I deserve it
I might buy that bitch a bag because she earned it
(I might buy that bitch a bag)
I ain't really into making friends
But shawty know that I am good friends with Ben
(That's my motherfucking nigga)
If I fucked once then I can fuck again
I'm that nigga bitch, and I'm talking been
(Bitch you know I been that nigga)
All a nigga know is play my role
I can't trust these hoes you know how it go
(I would never trust a bitch)
I get that coke and mix it with that soda
Pillsbury boy cause I can make some dough
(I know how to make a brick)
Just like the wind I'm blowing trees
I be blowing trees til I can't breathe
(Til I can't breathe)
And you know that I'm turnt up just for Reese
Every time I hit the scene I'm turnt like Reese
(Bitch you know I'm turnt like Reese)

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
All designer, get your grind up aye
I flex up on your bitch, I’m shining with these diamonds yayy
Look at my wrist, look how it bling, bloaw, blare
Got your bitch up in the stars and you know she quick to stare
They like ‘Soulja, you’re the best,’ and I say bitch I’m over here
If you looking at my diamonds then my diamonds quick to blare
And you see my Rollie shining and my diamonds in my ear
She say that she come up with me, I say bitch you sound so weird
She say ‘Soulja, you’re the man,’ rubber bands in my pocket
When I get a chance, got to spend it I can’t stop it
Ballin’ on these niggas with that Rollie, where your watch at?
Flexin’ on these bitches, ‘cept for wondering what the time is
Four gang, hit a stain, boy you is a lick
I hit a lick, they ain’t never ever seeing that shit
I came up in your bitch, tell her that I want a whip
Then these thotties sucked me, told that bitch get off my dick
Aye, I’m turnt like Reese
