Mama told me bring the racks home
Hop out the Rari I'm on chrome
Yeah I had to bring the racks home
Hop out the Rari you know I pull a four door
Chopper shoot near the motherfucking dome dome
I came out straight out the dome
Had to bring the racks home
Racks up

You know I had to run the racks up

You know I had to stack the racks up
A hundred thousand in one day boy I'm bad dawg
Hop out the Rari nigga you don't understand though
There is only one ways to learn a nigga stand up
Racks up racks up

[Verse 1]
Ride with my shadow like I am Jamaican
Stack the racks up man I don't have no patience
Rolling kicking sippin lean i could taste it
You diss on the game and we find your location
I bought a bentley coupe and bought a good lotto
[?] you seen it was obvious
Made a hundred K on sittin in the trap
Push out that pack like a NFL running back
Yeah yeah yeah I had to show em show em
I went and count on the road
I was getting cash everywhere that I go
Everywhere that we go
We would count up on the road
Up on the road
We would count up on the road
We would count up on the road
My niggas I got em
My bitches I got em
You know there's no problem
You know there's no problem
No problem I solve em
We stay getting money in the shoe red bottle christian
I'm guessing the money just listen
My young niggas riding
My bad bitches riding
Everybody riding
