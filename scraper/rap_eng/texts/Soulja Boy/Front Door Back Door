[Verse]
Young Draco nigga, you know I'm real nigga
I slide in that Bentley, they think I'm drug dealer
Jump out the top and my young nigga flip the switch
Quarter million in one day just to be specific
Fuck with Draco nigga I empty the clip
Had to go run it up, trappin' through the 6
Hop out the Rari, I look like the man
Round 250,000 on my Instagram
Look at it bitch, she staring, she my biggest fan
Whippin' my wrist in the pot like a ceiling fan
Who is him? I ain't ever heard of him
Make the wrong move then you know Draco's shoota gon murder him
Hop in the Lamborghini then I swerve on 'em
Junkie hit my front door, know what I'm servin' him
Front door back door, with the draco
Front door back door, front door back door
Trappin' a nigga runnin' up them pesos
Call up my plug he gon pull up with a whole case load
Stackin' up M&M's just like they Lego's
Call up my shooters, they shoot when I say so
Fuck with Lil Soulja, I'm sprayin' with the draco
Servin' the junkies, run up a bankroll
Ballin' on niggas, I sprained my ankle
Ran up them M's, nigga I got pesos
Fuck with the gang and we shootin' shit up
Fuck on yo bitch, you know what's up
I do a show, I'm on a tour bus
I'm in LA, now I'm up in New York
Fifty thousand in one day, that's just Soulja
Young nigga puttin' them bricks in a Rover
VVS diamonds, they come out the water
Young Draco nigga, I'm fuckin' yo daughter
Young Draco nigga, Ferrari the sport
Young Draco nigga trappin fuck nigga, come place yo order
Titanic my chain, put it in the water
VVS Audemars look like some coke
Young Draco pull up shootin' shit at that Madi Gras
I take a brick, ship it to Panama
100 bricks, put it in my momma house
Whip out that draco like what they talkin' bout?
