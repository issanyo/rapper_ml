She say she love me whatever that is? I dont know

She say she love me whatever that is I don't know?

Verse 1: Chief Keef
She says she know sosa he be flexing
Pull up windows down smell freshin
Good loud packs smell like cat piss
Hanging out the roof young and wreckless
Rocking in my Robin jeans
Campaign Sosa, every nigga following

We see a opp, shit get hectic
Alot of extended clips no acting
No sex bitch I only want the neck bitch

[Hook]
She say she luv me whatever dat is, I dont know
Do me a favor save dat shit
Like bad kids they be wreckless
My heart sold like taxes

Do me a favor save that shit
You fuck niggas better stay packing
Alot of extended clips no acting

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Woke up this morning in my swag on a million
Omg soulja soul she fin to kill em
New mixtape got the streets going crazy
Speakers going hammer
Whipping up baby, pull up to the road panamera like it's 80
30 on my trap got my cell going crazy
Yellow bone lady, suck me in the cede
Gucci eveyrthing, versace on my lens, soulja
I'm so outta here I'm feeling like the business
Sodmg swagga and we kill em
Soulja, sosa, go and take it over
2012 lamborghini whip in slow motion
