[Verse 1]
Forgiatos on my car
You know I'm going hard
I brought it from the start
Where was hustlin' in the street
Came up from concrete
And we all gotta eat
They look at me 'cause I'm a star
I'm in the kitchen goin' hard
I know this rap will take me far
And now I'm ridin' foreign cars
Everywhere that I go
They know who we are
When I'm walkin' in the club
They showin' nigga love
So I'm buying out the bar

[Hook]
I'm gettin' to the bands
I'm mixing lean with the Xans
Yo girl my biggest fan
She know that I'm the man
She know I'm gettin' it

I'm gettin' to the bands

[Verse 2]
Now I'm ridin' 'Raris now
Yeah, I'm ridin' Audis now
Shutting down parties now
Shut the party down
I'm gettin' money, get it up we're all done
I'm in the streets gettin' it
Ridin' in the Benz
And you know I'm gettin' it
All this cash in my pocket
Ferragamo on my belt
All this Louis on my shirt
All this Gucci on the show
All this money in my pocket
I'd be walkin' with the Lamb'
'Cause they know I'm gettin' it
The foreign car push the start
I came up from the bottom so you know I'm goin' hard

[Hook]
I'm gettin' to the bands
I'm mixing lean with the Xans
Yo girl my biggest fan
