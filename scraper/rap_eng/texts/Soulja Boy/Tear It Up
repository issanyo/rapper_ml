[Intro]
Yeah
Blast Gang in this motherfucker
Money… power…
You already know!

[Verse 1]
Tell my fans that the wait is over
Blast Gang bitch we taking over
Lil Dre AKA Soulja
So much money in my pockets bitch I thought I told you
Now Blast Gang gone in beast mode
Right pockets on c-note
Got it locked from the West to the east coast
Swisher sweet in the kush that's how we smoke
I hit the mall spent a G today
Cashed out like I ain't need the cake
Niggas talking like Beezy fake
Trying to count my pockets like what Beezy ate
It's not a question if I'm strapped mane
15 when I dove in the rap game
Two straps cocked back like Max Payne
Niggas asking what's the word, bitch it's Blast Gang

[Hook]
Gonna tear it up (tear it up)
Yeah boy gonna tear it up (tear it up)
Yeah boy gonna tear it up
[X4]

[Verse 2]
My snapback on some custom shit
These other niggas on some busta shit
I swear a broke nigga made me sick
That's why a nigga so arrogant (Fuck 'em)
And they couldn't find the residence
Got a young nigga feeling like the president (Obama)
Every time I drop these niggas copy me
I swear to god, niggas watching me
I ain't a door so why they knocking me
On everything I love ain't no stopping me
Blast Gang getting paid still
I might chill blow a L with Young L
Forgiatos spin like windmills
My record label spent bout 10 mil (Cash)
When the smoke clears a young nigga still here (Swag)
Blast Gang in your damn ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I hear them talking Soulja Boy young flashing it
But keep your mouth closed if you talking
Ditch multiple vehicles, bitch, just to match my fitness
And Blast Gang still blasting it
280 that's how fast the new Audi go
Red and blue diamonds like Mario
Homie bitch chose I ain't want the ho
The world is mine bitch I walk the globe
Haters' access get denied, on the red carpet no quote required (Soulja)
All these rappers make me laugh, looking hella tired
Then this morning I got hella fried
Said a prayer, then I got back to the dollar signs
I got hella thoughts in my mind
Like 40 million that I can't touch, any place, any time, nigga and what

[Hook]
