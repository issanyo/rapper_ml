(Damn son, where'd ya' find this?)

Drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank in my cup (Damn son, where'd ya' find this?)
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup, cup
Drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank in my cup
45 on my hip
Drank, drank in my cup
Drank, drank in my cup

Soulja Boy up in this ho
Watch me lean and watch me rock
Superman dat ho
Then watch me crank dat robocop
Super fresh, now watch me jock
Jocking on them haters man
When I do dat Soulja Boy
I lean to the left and crank that thang
(now yuuuuuu)
I'm jocking on yo bitch ass
And if we get to fightin
I'm cocking on your bitch ass
You catch me at yo local party
Yes I crank it everyday
Haters get mad cause
"I Got Me Some Bathin' Ape"
