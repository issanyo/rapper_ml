Soulja

I'm standing on the yacht, smokin' by the dock (Dre)
Got a couple thots, that think I'm hot (ewww)
These rappers think they hot, they really not
Maserati coupe, then I drop the top
I'm two hundred bands, foreign off the lot
I'm IHOP syrup, pouring up my guap
I'm fiending Ferragamo, each and every time
I'm hopin' out the cut, with shooters that make you blind
I got a foreign whip and a Maybach that's behind it
I gotta engine in the trunk and it go fire (and it go fire)
I'm lil dre, I'm big Soulja, I'm panamera
I'm west side, zone 1, red bandana

I'm on the private jet, I finesse
I just count the check, I ain't need it
Shoes on [?] Soulja boy wet, you know I'm bleedin'
Pull up on a block, AKA a' heatin'
Chopper, it's goin' find, and make ya blind
If, if she in my whip, you know she a dime
I like to get the chicken's whipped, that's all the time
He said he need thirty bricks, and I'm like, 'fine'
Rat-tat-tat with a [?]
Tony Montana, run through Atlanta
Nigga talking, Imma let him have it
Soulja Boy, told him, and I'm packin' a rat
Rich gang, that's up on my chain
The diamonds are fire flame
360 to 900, Tony Hawk, a hurricane
