[Intro:]
Whip whip whip whip
Whip whip whip whip
Whip whip whip

[Verse 1:]
Standin in the kitchen and I'm whippin up my wrist
Tattoos on my neck, tattoos on my chest
Ridin through the hood and I feel like I'm the best
My plug hit my phone and he bout to bring the rest
Ridin in the hood and you know that I finesse
Forgiato rims so you know a nigga flex
Bad yellow bone bitch, she say she want Soulja Boy
Ridin in that Rover boy, with that baking soda boy
Everybody know that SB gon cash out everything
Spend inside the mall and my jeweler give me every chain
Every ring, everything, Versace on my chain
I be getting that snow, every night you know I make it rain

[Hook: x2]
Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi (wax on, wax off)
Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi (wax on, wax off)
Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi (wax on, wax off)
Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi, Mr Miyagi (wax on, wax off)

[Verse 2:]
Call up my plug, tell em bring me that lean
I be promethazinin and I'm leanin on codeine
All these activist bricks, you really watchin me?
Niggas watchin me but I be steady flickin
I be steady juggin shit, I get everything for free
Millionaire status even when I'm in the street
Diamond chain on my neck that cost me 30 keys
Young Dre, I got bitches all overseas
