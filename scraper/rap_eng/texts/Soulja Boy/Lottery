[Chorus:]
I’m balling like i hit the lottery [x3]
A hundred thousand ain’t nothing to me
I’m balling like i hit the lottery
I bought a 50 on the shopping spree
None of you niggers ain’t stopping me
None of you niggers ain’t stopping me
Lottery [x7]
I’m balling like i hit the lottery [x3]
None of you niggers ain’t stopping me
Fucking them fucking them fucking them
Fucking them fucking them [x2]
Baby girl fucking up

[Verse 1:]
Breaking down the combo i guess I’m good looking nobble
6 7 8 now I’m in love with the cake
I just want a resil i just make a hundred million
You a hater and you broke and you lame
Tell me how that feels
Fuck it up fuck it up fuck it up
Fuck it up fuck it up
Baby girl fuck it up
Drag me down drag me down
Baby girl help me push it up
I just got this new bentley truck
I think i will do it up in the truck
Man fuck the range rover
They ain't nothing but a miniature

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My momma she means the most to me
Momma i love her to death
Momma daddy never get me
I give my momma what's left
I hopped in the rari and left
They put my CD’s on the shelf
I am soulja but tell them i stay with them
Make me all shoot them in the neck
Taking your breath away
Up in the yatch me an my girl and sailing
And we looking so heavenly
Call us amigo like andale andale
I don't fuck with the basic
I don't fuck with you basic
Nigga you too basic
Bitch you too basic
I’m getting you money you just got a face

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I’m balling like i hit the lottery
The lottery
