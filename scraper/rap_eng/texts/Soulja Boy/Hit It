[Chorus]
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it, hit it
Hit it
Whip
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Whip
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it, hit it
Hit it

[Verse One]
My diamonds, they dancin'
Pull up to mansions
Hop out the Phantom
Twenty fifteen, I'm takin' a Grammy
Whippin' and whippin' and hit
Stupid lil' nigga, I'm rich
Ride through the city, I'm lit
Pussy, I'm fuckin' your bitch
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
I'm about to make a billion
See me in a fuckin' city
Soulja got the whip, no ceilings
Whip, whip, whip, whip
All my fuckin' hitters hittin'
All you niggas say you hitters
But all you niggas missin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Red ruby, my diamonds
Stupid shit shinin'
Bently reclinin'
Niggas can't find me
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
It ain't hard to tell time
Rolex, that lookin' so fine
Drippin' and dressed in VVS diamonds
Diamonds that came from Africa
Whip it, flip it like a spatula
Drippin' in blood like Dracula
My whip, it lookin' spectacular
Diamond chain, I'm ambassador
Ride in that Lam, I go faster, bruh
Niggas is broke
Niggas is lame
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I rock fire flame
Thirty thousand my Giuseppe chain
Fifty thousand KOD ring

[Chorus]
