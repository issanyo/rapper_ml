[Verse 1:]
I got a bad getting cash
She got a fat ass making it splash
I got all this money i got all this cash
I’m a drop a coop and never smash

[Chorus:]
Smash smash smash smash smash smash smash [x5]

[Verse 2:]
She ain't feel a cheese
Girlfriend get a new bikini
But sense of late you ain't getting no money
I’m zone one it ain't no stunting
Young rich game I’m telling you man
I tell you man tell you man
If you run off on me I’ll be mad
Am going to bust your brain
I pull up in maserati and fine fame

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
My wrist turn in on when I’m in the hood
Don't you all get misunderstood
I was in
Welcome to the soldier world
You can be my soldier girl
I got diamond on my neck that looks like pearl
I’ll be making money all across the world

[Chorus]
