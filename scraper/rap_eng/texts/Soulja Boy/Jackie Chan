Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan

[Verse 1]
Man, they say I'm kicking shit like Jackie Chan
In the club and I'm smoking Mary Jane
Chains on my neck and they know my name
Rep what I claim, that's that money game
Turn up, see, I be swaging hard, ain't no one like me
I can cook the dope with no recipe
If you ask about Soulja then they know my name
I be hustling hard, I do it for the fame
Took the rap game and I made it bump
If you come to west side that's my zone one
Everybody know me be turning up
Whole lot of kush we be burning up
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
I got a lot of cash, I got a lot of fame
Day that I retire they gonna miss me, man
Until that day I'm flexing hard with 30 chains
Turn up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Them niggas got mad when I got some money
Made a million dollars, now they looking at me funny
Riding through my hood in a Maserati
When I hop up out that car got snapped by paparazzi
Word around town Soulja De Biasi
Right pocket clean but my little pocket sloppy
I be making money like Illuminati
Fresh airways with tattoos on my body
Your girl look at me, turn up in a party
I be sipping lean, popping bottles of Bacardi
All the white boys say that I am naughty
My line stay short just like Stevie Harvey
I smoke a lot of dope, roll a lot of molly
Sip a lot of lean, pop a lot of Xanax
All the girls on me, hard to grow steady
SOD gang, SOD party
