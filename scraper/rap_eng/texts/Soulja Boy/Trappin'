[Intro]
Turn up
Soulja
Young Soulja
Young Soulja!
Life After Fame shit man, you know what I'm saying?
Stacks On Deck Money Gang
Rich Gang
Turn up

[Verse 1]
Pull up in that rubber, god damn Soulja taking over
10 chains on... dope with the baking soda
Forgiato rims, Burberry Timbs
Damn, Soulja outta here
This right here my here
Flexing 30 birds for the summer, pull up in a Hummer
Soulja number one, young stoner, you don't want the drama
Riding with the cake
AK-47, MAC-11 throw away
It's a good day, on my body
Nothing but 'Sace
Ralph Lauren
Steady touring
And my whip foreign
10 chains on my neck and I'm still flexing
Rich Gang, Young Soulja 'bout a check
Pull up to the hood, everything good
10 chains on, gripping leather wood
Riding 'round town, ready for the action
100 million dollars and I'm still trappin'

[Hook]
Trappin' trappin' trappin'
Trappin' trappin' trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'

[Verse 2]
Hopping out the clean, (?) seen
'Sace in my body, in a limousine
Popping gold bottles, I'm going ham
Smoking loud, video on Instagram
50 bricks in
I've been stacking millions since 2010
Pull up in that all white cocaine, that Benz
Young Dre he flex, go hard a hundred M

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got Medusa on my damn chain
Riding through the hood, blowing loud, and they know my name
2013, red beam
GT (?)
Smoking on loud, I jumped in the crowd
50k up on my bracelet watch like wow
Baking soda whip, a Rover going cray
Riding 'round town with that 38

[Hook]
