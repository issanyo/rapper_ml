Lil bitch you don't have the nerve

You can catch Boat on your avenue
You can catch Boat on your avenue, damn

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Soulja I ain't act like a sauna
I gave that bitch the wrong number
I'm whippin' it up, Benihanas
I'm pullin' up in a Hummer
Me and Rich the Kid, rich
Take a bitch, give her dick
Ride 'round with a foreign whip
30 with the holla tips
I'm whippin, I'm whippin, I'm back in the kitchen
My bitch is with me know I'm rock up and listen
Fuckin' that bitch in the whip
Y'all niggas taking the dinner

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Lil bitch you don't have the nerve
Boy got the jugg in his cup
Told that bitch we goin' up
Told that bitch we goin' up, whoa
Lil bitch I don't have the nerve
Boy got the jugg in his cup
Told that bitch we goin' up
Told that bitch we goin' up, whoa
Told that bitch we goin' up
Told that bitch we goin' up, whoa
Told that bitch we goin' up
Told that bitch we goin' up, whoa
Switch the rules, switch the rules, switch the rules
Blew up too quick they ain't had a clue
You can catch Boat on your avenue
You can catch Boat on your avenue, damn
