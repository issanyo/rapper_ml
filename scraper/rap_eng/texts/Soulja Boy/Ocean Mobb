[Hook: Soulja Boy & Waka Flocka Flame]
If you drunk
If you high
Swim in the ocean
If you too turned up
Stay down
Stay swerving
White liquor, brown liquor, what the fuck you smokin'?
Where you at, where you go, when that shit is rollin'?
Ocean Mobb,Ocean Mobb,Ocean Mobb, we splashin'
Ocean Mobb,Ocean Mobb,Ocean Mobb, we dressed in.
In the club, in the club, in the club we mobbin'
Surfin' in the crowd call it ocean mobbin'

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
2 mollies, yes I'm feeling drowny
Purple in my styrofoam got me feeling slow
Enough hoes on me but i can handle one more
Yellow bitches on me did you know yellow can blow?
Red bentley, red carpet spending
Style on the ground, with all my fucking jewelry
Ocean Mobb,Ocean Mobb crowd surfing!
Drunk driving, DUI, we swerving!

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Im jumpin' in the crowd, and everybody like 'wow!'
Shouts out flocka flame, that's my ocean bro!
You know that we get cash, Ocean Mobb we splash
Underwater in a lamborghini swear to god i almost crashed
My kush blunt get ashed, the other rappers in thrash
I came out the water and i european my dash
60 in the thrash these niggas are last
And flocka flexed so hard that me made a birthday bash
