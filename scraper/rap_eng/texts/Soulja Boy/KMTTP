Baby you know that I miss you

Tonight but I cannot baby girl and that's the issue
Girl you know I miss you
I just wanna kiss you
But I can’t right now so baby kiss me through the phone
Kiss me through the phone
I'll see you later on
I'll see you later on
Kiss me through the phone
Kiss me through the phone
When I get home

And I wish that I could see your face
And I wish that I could tell you things
Please don’t cry just tell me things that you might never tell your friends
I know you're scared cause I'm not there with you
I hate that I can't be there with you

Girl you know I miss you

But I can't right now so baby kiss me through the phone
Kiss me through the phone

I'll see you later on
Kiss me through the phone
Kiss me through the phone
When I get home

And I wish that I could see your face
And I wish that I could tell you things

Get on the phone
Kiss me
