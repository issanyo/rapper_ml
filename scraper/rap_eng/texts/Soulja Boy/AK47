Nigga thought it was a game until he said he want to beef
I run inside yo momma house and shoot that bitch off in her teef
I run inside yo sister house and shoot that bitch off in her feet
Fuck you and your whole street, Soulja Boy gone bring the heat
You bitch ass niggas know my name, I’m in that bentley fire flame
Pussy niggas SOD’s nigga and nothings changed
But the fucking bank account, any any any amount
Nigga it’s unlimited, I’m aiming while you’re sprinting bitch
It’s Soulja tell ‘em remenice about up in the younger day
Now I’m in the rouger way and niggas lookin funny man
If you want the beef I’ll pull the chopper and I’m stuntin mane
I’m flashing with the AK
Might fuck around, throw a grenade
Soulja Boy I’m so damn brave
I’m in that A, I’m on my street
Every street know me, isn’t a street don’t know me
Zone 1 to zone 4 to zone 6 is on me
Shout outs to Gucci, let’s shoot this fuckin movie
