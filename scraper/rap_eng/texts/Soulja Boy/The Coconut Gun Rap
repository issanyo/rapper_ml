He-he-here we go
So they're finally here
Performing for you
If you know the spurts you can join in too
Put your hands together
If you wanna clap
His coconut gun
Can fire in spurts

You know his coconut gun is finally back
To fire in spurts
His coconut gun
Can fire in spurts
If he shoots ya

Is bigger, faster, stronger too
He's the gun member of the coconut crew
HUH!

With her coconut gun

And stretch his arms out to fire his coconut gun
Inflate his balloon
