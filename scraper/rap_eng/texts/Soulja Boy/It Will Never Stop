[Chorus:]
Get into them benz get into them cars
When I’m up with that Soulja boy i keep that money
Catch me in that Mercedes counting bars
And you know these shit will never stop
It will never stop [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I don't want to talk i just put that up on my car
This will never ever stop
She keep blowing up my phone she won't leave me alone
Now I’m riding around in a single cone
I’m talking cash on my money phone
The money gone
I just got a brand new ferrari
I just fucked your bitch and i ain’t sorry
I got cash and gold too
If you in the shop boy you know what you gotta do
Put her to the club and spend a twenty too
Girls i don't know all they wanted is my tool
She got on a tattoo she put on my shoe
I dropped her rude i got you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Because when I’m on the top put that on my lap
This will never ever stop
Pull up in that black rari and that black suit
Ain't got no time for you up with my necklace
I want you niggers to know soulja getting fucked though
Pull up in the lambo now its toplesss
Nigga we made it
Yeah look at my wrist when i drive that mercedes
She driving me crazy i do what i do
50 thousand on the juice and none of made most off my photo shoot
Nigga you feeling me i say 50 off my shoes
We coming in and we killing you
Its really you pulling up see you pulling up on them
See for me i do what i got to do
You know what you got to do
You know what i got to do [x3]
Seven year working of miracle
It's a miracle what you laughing you laughing
Nothing is hysterical

[Chorus:]
Get into them benz get into them cars
When I’m up with that soulja boy i keep that money
Catch me in that mercedes counting bars
And you know these shit will never stop
It will never stop [x2]
Cause when I’m on the top
This will never ever stop
