Soulja boy tellem a fool. Ridin around in the trap, Ridin around with the pistol it's sitting all in my lap. Fitted pistol in yo mouth it go through the gap
AK47 right on the shoulder like Rambo keeping the strap
Ferragamo on my belt, gucci is all on my face
I'm calling my lawyer he Jewish you know he beating the case
I'm saying my grace, I'm eating my plate, it tasting so great
You kno that these niggas they hate I'm real and they fake
Go hard for the cake, I'm dumping bodies in lake, to land me estate
Lil Soulja the great, I'm going hard in the paint
