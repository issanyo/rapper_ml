On the block hot, all my boys hot
Never gone stop

[Soulja Verse]
I just been real from the start
I just been going so hard
All of my team got heart
I just been waited I had so much patience now we made it to the top
They saying soulja man you finally did it
I had to do it, did this shit for my city
My team wit me, man these niggas they killing
We getting money we got hunets and fiftys
I pull up Swerving while I'm riding in Bentleys
I'm sipping lean man its all in my kidneys
We killing niggas we ain't leaving no witness
We getting money throwing hunets and fiftys
Them twenties bitches pick it up off the ground
Everybody know I got the pounds
King Soulja got a hunet rounds when I'm in yo city man its going down
On a private jet while I'm going up
Sipping so much lean got me throwing up
Lean all in my system got me snoring up
And it make no sense how I be pouring up
All of my niggas know I keep the Double cup
Double cup Double cup yeah you know that I did it
My niggas running thru the city pouring up lean and
Trapping 30 pounds of migit

[Soulja Verse ll]
Killing this shit when I'm in the streets
Man I'm doing this shit for my niggas
My niggas pull triggers
My niggas they working them figures
My niggas moving putting niggas in ditches
My niggas trapping we came straight from the trenches
Riding on rims that's 26 inches
Niggas mad I got bitches switching in positions
Diamonds up in different dimensions
Trapping capping nigga can't you tell
As I swerve thru the city with bags and bells
Weigh it up put it on the scale
Break it down, Roll it up, put it up in the air
Pulling up in that new ghost and I scare ya
I got the kilos and Iggy Azalea
Making it rain yeah I change the weather
All of the diamonds I put em together
Soulja Boy Tell'em head hancho
My grand daddy he got the bricks from ????
I finesse the plug from Pablo
I took 20 million and ran as fast as I could wells Fargo
Still spending, still getting, still winning
Niggas know there ain't no stopping you
Soulja Boy Tell'em im Trapping and capping
My niggas doing the impossible
