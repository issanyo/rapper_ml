[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I feel so high like I'm on a plane
Like I'm on Cloud 9 and I'm makin' it rain
Black shoes, black shirt, black hat
Black diamonds, black everything, I brought black back
Black Franck Muller, tell her head will top that
I'm so out of here, you can't stop that
That's just a fact, I can't feel my face
I'm so outer space, I'm so in a daze

[Chorus: Matt & Kim]
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, I've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Come with me, I'm a goner
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, I've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Life's too short to wait any longer

[Post-Chorus: Matt & Kim]
Oh, I'm a goner, can't you see
Started shallow, going deep
Oh, I'm a goner, can't you see?
Singing 6 feet beneath
And I'm a goner, bit by bit
Bed's too thin, I'm over it
A chalk-drawn picture while you sleep
I said "I'm a goner, can't you see?"

[Verse 2: Andrew W.K.]
I said "I'm a goner, you better not look for me
I'm a goner, I'm long gone, now boy I'm tellin' you
I'm a goner, you're never ever gonna find me
Oh, I'm a goner, I'm long gone so sing that song"

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Soulja Boy (Andrew W.K. and Matt & Kim)]
I'll be there any minute, don't you wait for me
Believe me, I'm a goner, it's too late for me
Take me out my shoes, no replacing me
It's okay, I'm living 2 lives, no saving me
(Oh, oh)
(I said, oh oh, oh oh)
(I said, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus] (x2)
