Soulja Boy is one of the most important figures in the last 10 years of hip hop but he is routinely denied the credit he deserves. He's kept a lower profile the past few years after a massive blast of publicity due to a couple of high profile beefs but he came through and hung out with me and we had a great conversation about where he's at in life and how far he's come. Enjoy!
