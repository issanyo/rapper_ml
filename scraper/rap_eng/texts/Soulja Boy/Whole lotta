Whole lotta' money whole lottta' guns
Whole lotta' money whole lotta' guns
Whole lotta' money whole lotta' guns
All we do is shoot guns for fun

[verse1]
Whole lotta' money, whole lotta' guns
Whole lotta' choppers with them drums
New crib new car, brand new fronts
I got my money up AK-47 split your tummy up
We get money bruh, all them niggas looking bummy bruh
What the fuck, pull up in a panorama , gucci bandana
Whole lotta' motherfucking racks, they like I dare him
I got 30 k in my robin jeans , with that ruger
Automatic uzi toting guns and I'm toting em cooler
50 k one day flexing versace medusa
Clip up, in my pocket as long as a ruler
Ak 47 mac eleven bruh I dare to blast it
Make a nigga dissapear, like I know magic
Damn it its tragic, sipping and whipping I blast it
Putting your bodies in caskets
Soulja boy tell em, all about racks
Grind for holics trap-a-holic I got you some K in the back
Running in do's like a replay, I run em for flat
