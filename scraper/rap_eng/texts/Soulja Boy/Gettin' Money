Getting money (x8)

Jbar:
You get money damn right I get money yah (x4)
Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2)

Soulja Boy:
I'm reading all you broke ass niggas like a book
Jbar should be a boxer he so fire with dat hook
When it come to get money nigga I'm the one to talk to with
I am the shit dog and you are just dog shit
Cause pussy ass niggas keep texting my blackberry
They report him on the news they would say it's a blackberry
Kush mixed with purple
Don't you smell the odor
Fuck with me and get your head popped like a soda
When it comes to this rap shit, I am the best man
In high school I was a senior but I had to stay fresh man
They doubted me in person now they feeling like dummies
But I never gave a fuck 'cause I was always getting money (ooh)

Jbar:
You get money damn right I get money yah (x4)
Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2)

Soulja Boy:
My chain gold diamonds like a mutha fucking Oscar
Your chain looking faded like some mutha fucking copper
He's dry snitching talking to the damn coppers
Have his ass scared leaking red like a lobster
2 million dollars cash in front of me like I'm a mobster
Their comments keep me entertained so shout out to the bloggers
Soulja, spit that hot shit like Ether
He don't like me I don't like his ass either
When the beef is on, we will pull a all nighter
Send his head shot like I ma damn sniper
My nigga can't follow bitch I can go further
Rest in peace to this track cause this shit had been murdered
