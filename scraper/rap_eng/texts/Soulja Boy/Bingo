[Chorus Gucci Mane]
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your mama: scream "Bingo!"

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Hello, my watch yellow
Earrings on my bezel
Can’t fit in my schedule
'Less booty like Jello
She know I slang kilos
Shout out to my ‘migo
I call, he says "10-4"
Tight like Lamont Rollo
Murcielago for El Gato
My house like a brothel
Fat hoes in Chicago
First class to Morocco
Bingo called my motto
Phantom with two models
Pull up tonight, stunt
Jump out the car, scream guapo

[Chorus Gucci Mane]
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your mama: scream "Bingo!"

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Ridin in my Lambo, kids screaming "Bingo"
Haters wanna hate, they’ll get shot like a free throw
Candy paint wet, dripping off my headlights
Catch me in the trap like some motherfuckin' dead mice
Every time I cut a corner kids screaming "Bingo!
Tools on deck, I ain't talking Home Depot!
Soulja Boy Tell Em: I’m icey as an icicle
So much money, bitch, I valet park my bicycle

[Chorus Gucci Mane]
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your mama: scream "Bingo!"

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
All the hood hoes point like "Bingo"
Waka Flocka; “Oh Let’s Do It” is the single
Let’s mingle, got hoes like Wingo
My bitch a dime, your bitch like a cinco
Like a free throw, man I’m balling out
Blew a kiss to the girls, now they falling out
I pull up a T-top Cutlass like "Bingo"
My girlfriend Regal, same color as a flamingo

[Chorus Gucci Mane]
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your mama: scream "Bingo!"
