[Intro]
Soulja
Draco
Ballout
Gang
Big mansions, nigga
I spent a hundred on my wrist
Rich nigga shit
You know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
Two million cash
All hundo's
All blue

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I spent a hun' on my wrist
Walk in this bitch with a brick
Hop on a private, young nigga go and fly with a fish
Walk in the bank, I got M&M's
Hundred fifty thousand, new rollie wrist
Ooh, can't forget about the Richard Mille
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, in a new Lamb' truck
Hundred K for a show, bricks on tour bus
Coming in, bitch I got bricks and they duffled up
Louis V on me, nigga already know what's up
VVS diamond, a rollie my wrist
Flawless diamonds on a brand new Patek
Bust down that star, my diamonds on fleek
Fuck on a bitch every day of the week
I hit the plug for two hundred and fifty P's
VVS diamonds, my ice is on freeze

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Rollie wrist, shinin
Bust down, diamonds
Bentley seats, reclining
Water wet-wet, VVS I'm shinin
Beat the pot up, dope look like China
Bust down Rollie wrist, know a nigga shinin
Shinin, shinin, shinin, shinin
Shout out the gang, cause the whole gang shinin

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Forty-one got the boogers
My trap house got the hookup, I'm no sugar
Walk in the room, they shook up
My ice look like all I do is cook up
Since I been booked up, I been coolin' at the ClearPort with my foot up
You know I'm coming to get my back end when I come to your city, so just pull up

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Rollie wrist, shinin
Bust down, diamonds
Bentley seats, reclining
Water wet-wet, VVS I'm shinin
Beat the pot up, dope look like China
Bust down Rollie wrist, know a nigga shinin
Shinin, shinin, shinin, shinin
Shout out the gang, cause the whole gang shinin
