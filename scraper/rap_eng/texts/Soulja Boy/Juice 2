Eleven years, all with some nickelbacks
Walkin' through zone 3 with some dime bags
Goddamn a young nigga was stupid bad
All in the classroom, stupid bad
Walkin' through the hood, I was stupid mad
Tryna get new J's at the superhustle
Pullin' up on pikes with my lil brotha
We do this shit for real, west side struggle
Juice II and my interview with big diamond
Flashing out on niggas like the big timers

On my private jet like ching ching
Hop about that bitch, 9 nigga flashin'

Lil Dre, for real, young and reckless
Pullin' up, foreign Porsche, hopping out

Juice 2, I poll a deuce nigga
Pullin' up, beefin' fuck a truce nigga
Y'all already know what it do nigga
A young nigga straight up out the west side
They made it to the beats, I don't stunt it now
My hood here, my ball like what's happening?
I ride through my city, and packing
Never lack and we ready for action
Juice 2 splash and it's swaggin'
I'm on a red carpet with 'bout 50 racks
Hop up out the VIP like give me that
And my niggas gotta get that cake
So I'm pullin' up and getting cake
And we hustlin' hard for everything
I'm talkin' gold watches, I'm talkin' gold chains
Flexin' on these peons

Young Dre, Soulja got the juice though

Heavinly packin', heavinly stackin', heavinly getting this money
Niggas flexin' but I really wanna run up on these with that stuntin'
Young Soulja be flexin', go long dead man it ain't nothing
