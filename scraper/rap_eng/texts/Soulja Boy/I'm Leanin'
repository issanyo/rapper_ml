(Soulja Boy Tell Em')
I'm leaning like uh kickstand
Yeah it got yo boy gone
All in the club and I'm standing in my own zone
Man I'm on the optimal
Man I'm on that cookie monster
Rollin on that OG kush
Man I'm bout to get the doe
Movin' like a slug doe
Movin' in slow motion
Racks in my pocket, Shawty bout to bust it open
Yellow bone bitch and she say she love my tattoos
Took her to the bathroom, she sucked me like a vacuum
Got damn I'm leanin', it must be the dreamin'
An all of these hoes on yo boy, they straight fienin'
Million dollar penis, I put it in her pussy
Came out the water, I never been ???? ?????
