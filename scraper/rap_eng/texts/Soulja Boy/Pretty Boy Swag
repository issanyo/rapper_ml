Girls on my dick when I pretty boy swag
Girls scream my name when I pretty boy swag
Watch me, pretty boy swag, pretty boy swag

[Verse 1]
Get out the way! Pretty boy comin thru

Girls on me heavy cause I look so sexy
Yellow diamond shawty, in the club straight flexin
I'm lookin for a yellow bone long-haired star
Thick, in the hips come, get in my car
You party with a star, we take off and go to Mars
Pretty boy take off in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

No homo shawty, but my chest is straight flexin
Tatted on my neck, shawty said she choose me
She got nice titties and a fat ass booty
Took her to my condo, let the girl strip
Then she got naked then she pretty girl dipped
Damn I like the way, lil' mama shake that ass
She pretty girl, dancin while I pretty boy swag, goddamn

[Chorus]

All, the girls, are on me, damn
Every, body, pay, attention

Girls scream my name when I pretty boy swag
Watch me, pretty boy swag, pretty boy swag
