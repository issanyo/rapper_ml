Pussy ass nigga want beef with SB

Rich gang Soulja Boy damn I be high
Middle finger to the sky

Wake up in the morning and I'm high from the last day
Riding through my hood kush blunts in the ashtray
Soulja Boy Tell 'em get paid all the time
I get paid just to rhyme

When I close my eyes all I see is dollar signs
Ima rich ass nigga and ima get mine
If a nigga diss me, ima diss him back
If a nigga shoot at me, ima kill that bitch

Riding through the hood I feel like I'm on probation
