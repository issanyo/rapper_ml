[Verse 1]
These days man I'm feelin' like the man
I got a master plan, to make a trillion
My corporation on deck can you understand
Soulja Boy Tell'Em money in my hand
The world is yours, the world is mine
Your girl on the corner man I see she lookin' fine
I pass by in my drop top AMG
They lookin' at me like who's payin' me?
I'm payin' me 'cus I'm self made
I'm self paid yeah I'm self made
I'm my own boss paid the cost to be the boss
Now I live the high life and I rep it and I floss

[Interlude]
Uh, now put your hands up
This that feel good music
SOD
High Life

[Verse 2]
Back on the track mane
No pad no pen I'm goin' in mane me and the win
It's just me and the world, I'm travellin'
I'm gettin' it in, SOD gang unravellin'
I swear I'm grabbin' I'm defyin' the laws
I'm breakin' it alls while I'm dropping them jaws
People, they astonished by my work
But I say I'm put here on this earth to do work
I'm S. Beezy, I make it look easy
I used to rock a million dollar chain that was freezy
But I got the knowledge but I ain't went to college
Self taught self made self bought self paid Soulja...
Big diamond watch mane
But it don't really mean nothin'
Long as I'm happy and livin' my life
And earnin' my stripes, every damn day
Young S. Beezy I gotta get cake
24/7 seven days out the week
Thinkin' bout money even when I'm asleep
I wake up in the morning then I start my mission
Thank god for the day and then I start to get it
Walk up on the track then I start to rip it
Thank to my fans for bringing me here
SOD Money Gang every year is our year uh
And every day is my day
DeAndre Cortez mo'fuckin' Way
Get it in your face like every damn day
Just like I said I'm just settin' it straight
For the mo'fuckin' record I'm SOD
I don't give a fuck man my click too deep
Spreadin' my music through these streets
I go hard in the paint like Flocka Flame
In my drop top Gallardo switchin' lanes
Man every day I try maintain
They want your boy to be out stressin'
I can't do that 'cus I'm too cool
This gon' happen then let it be
Let it be, if he want beef then he's deceased
I'm a pitbull off the leash
Got grief, oh me I meant good grief
I OD'd I down swag
I switched it up the steez
I'm too bad, I pop tabs that's too bad that's too sad
Now if I could I would but I can't so I ain't
I break paint, S. Beezy what you think
I'm the weirdest fish in the tank

[Outro]
