[Verse 1]
Jump on a plane, I go to Dubai
Balenci' my kicks, this nigga too fly
Porsche Panamera, I trap out America
I see the man when I look in the mirror
When I drip in the VIP, all the girls stare
Eliante when I put on my earring (Water)
I fell in love with my jewelry (Water)
Hop in Bugatti, I'm steering
I'm on a private jet, leering
I put hundred racks in Amiri's
She say my name, I appear
I'm sippin' on lean not beer (Lean)

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's

[Verse 2]
Hop on a plane, I go to Dubai
Whippin' that dope, you know I'm too fly
Watch out the bullets, they hittin' your eye
Slime, trap out the condo
I got the water, that H2O
Yeah, trap out the studio
We sippin' lean, no Julio
Got the bands, them benjamins
All of my niggas, we get it in
I'm sippin' on lean, not Ritalin
I fuck with the plug, not the middleman
I stack up the cash, the dividend
Whip up the dope, and it tasting like cinnamon
Pop a Percocet, I'm feelin' like limitless
Jump in Bugatti, skrrt off with the back end

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
