[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Got a couple killers nigga, that money is all in my belt nigga
Ferrugumo on me, you niggas ain't getting no help nigga
I need no remorse, pull up in block and I pull in a Porsche
These niggas get wet, shout out my squad and shout out my set
Got a couple killers shoot you all in your neck, just for the check
I be all on the jet, look at my neck
A young nigga flex
Came from the bottom with the goblins little pussy ass nigga
I went through the rain, 100 million man I run up my check up little nigga

[Verse 2: Dae Dot]
They hate cause I swag
Bitch why is you mad, I'm making that cash
I'm doing the dash, out the window blow the ass
I'm running the mingle my math, I'm all in them sacks
Can't take off my racks, got money I flex
Pull up in the Jag, put the money in the bag
Hit them up, hop in them tags
Then load up the mag, see you looking sad
You dead in the bag
Your family mad, got your ass with the mag
Hop in my eyed eagle fast
Gimme that shit, bitch gimme that shit
I'm bout to hit me a lick, to feel me a brick
Pourin' the lean out the kit, Actavis pour up a 6
My niggas collectively rich
They hop on my dick, I split 30k on my shit
My bitches legit, I fuck em but we do not kiss
My niggas collectively rich, but I do not care about a bitch
Got lean in the whip, big as a red beam in my hip
I skate with the pole, I don't swift
That's how you get rich, I'm fucking these hoes on the trip

[Verse 3: Reese Money Bagz]
My guns they go bang, leave your ass dead in the rain
Treat your ass up when we hang
SOD that be the gang
Fuck with us, delete your name
I'm with the gang [?]
But no I don't like that shit cray
Nigga we'll take off your brain
Diamonds all over my chain
[?]
Hallow tip rip up your brain
Every track we go insane
Rather go hard in the paint
Tryna get rich, fuck the fame
The white girl like Loul Deng
Put my momma in the rain
You ain't get money you lame
I take off like a plane
[?]
Killing shit like hurricanes
So nah nigga I can't complain, Only rich niggas relate
I ainâ€™t have shit but the fame
[?]
I feel like loco, pull up on yo block they go loco
30 gonna knock off your polo
You only live once, that's the motto
