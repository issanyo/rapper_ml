[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Ball and grinde with some real ones
Grab my chopper, count up some milions
Everything designer, I just wanna kill m
Getting all this cash, counting up the millions
Milions on milions, milions on milions

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Came up from the bottom, had nothing
Now I pull up in a Lambo, and I'm stuntin
I came up counting cash, yeah, I'm getting money
Pull up in an auti, yeah, I drive it
Then I hit brodies, feel them when I'm shopping
Bad bitch, she on me, yeah, you know she top me
Came up from the bottom, came up on the scene
Young nigga pull up, yeah, I'm sellin that lean
All the glory, you know I'm the king
Standing in the kitchin, trappin and survin everything
Fludded out my wrist, fludded out everything
When I killed every scene, put them choppers in my jeans
200,000 in cash, Lambo didgital dash
Getting to the money, pop a Perk and a Xan
They didn't understand, I had a plan
Nigga, we made it, getting to them bands
Get to the guap, never ever stop
All my niggas hot, thugs on the block
Never will give up, working so hard

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Ball and grinde with some real ones
Grab my chopper, count up some milions
Everything designer, I just wanna kill m
Getting all this cash, counting up the millions
Milions on milions, milions on milions

[Verse 2: Jbar]
Getting right to the money, let's get these hundreds
Always in something, tell you something
Ice cold, yeah my ice cold
Go back, no, got all these bad hoes
Running it up, never giving a fuck
Questioning if I love these hoes, no, fuck
Now I'm balling, living it up
Chacing that cheese, in love with that money
Lambo doors, still on that paper chace
No matter where I go, gotta get that paper

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Ball and grinde with some real ones
Grab my chopper, count up some milions
Everything designer, I just wanna kill m
Getting all this cash, counting up the millions
Milions on milions, milions on milions
