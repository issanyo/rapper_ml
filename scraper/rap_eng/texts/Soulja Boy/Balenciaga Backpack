[Intro]
CpainBeatz, ho
Uh
Ayy

[Hook]
Damn, he got bricks in the backpack
Run up on gang, man, you know I'ma clap that
Versace couch where he put that strap at
Porsche Panamera, ridin' 'round where the racks at
On my lap where I keep the MAC at
Bust down Rolex, got me on Snapchat
Ridin' 'round town with the bricks in my backpack
Hunnid bricks in Balenciaga backpack
Balenciaga backpack

[Verse]
Swervin' the foreign, I pull to the trap in another whip
I got hunnid racks on me, nigga, ain't no matchin' that
In the back seat, that's a strap on top another strap
Hop out that bitch with a hunnid racks
Jump out the coupe and I swerve that shit just like a stolen whip
Money Gang, I feel like the President
In a helicopter with 250 bricks
On a private jet, I'm state-to-state movin' with bricks
Touch down in quick, trip with that strap on my hip
Run up on gang, you gon' get hit with hollow tip
I'm heavily trappin', I guess that's why she on my dick
Hop out that bitch, it's another foreign whip
First opportunity, did it to get rich
Fell in love with my Draco extended clip
Red bottoms on the bottom of my jean, drip
