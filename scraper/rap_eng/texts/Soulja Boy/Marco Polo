Trick!
Soulja Boy Tell 'em! Yeah!
And your boy Bow Wow in the building, ha ha
My swag is too official man
Ay Soulja, my swag too man!
(Y’all can’t catch up)
Ayo Bow! Let ‘em know how you lookin’ up! Ow!

New G shirt
Yellow Lamborghini
BBC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans
Black cars, spinnin' when I hit the mall
Ya can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all

Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo, ay!

Took my car to the mall then I blacked out
Now my closet full of J's like a crackhouse
Ceiling so high, you would think it was Shaq house
Whip so big that it beep when I back out

Like beep, beep, ayo tell that *** move this
Bow Wheezy, Mr. "Get ‘em where the dinner's cool"
I step up in the room, put ya ice on my chain B
All the bad ******* screamin' like they angry

Some call me cocky but how could you blame me?
There no other ******** like me because my money lanky
Yeah! And I'm still the first to rock man
Yeah! First to put ice in a G shot

And she like my new G shirt
Yellow Lamborghini
BBC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans
Black cars, spendin’ when I hit the mall
Ya can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all

Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo, ay!

Never been fake ‘cause all the girls love official
S.O.D. ‘cause girls love initials
I'm on another level, I'm in my zone
Black car, white rims, can't they both get along?

This is not The Matrix but I am the oracle
"Do you wanna get wit me?" The question is rhetorical
Say the same lines but the fans aren't bored of me
75 thousand dollars if you want to order me

Hold on! Let me change my swag
My flow broadband, y’all boy still LAN
My whole click straight, y’all whole click ****
Last night your girl forehead was on my abs

Gucci bandana
Louis V leather
Keep on lookin' there's no lame gutta
Air Force Ones mixed with the new J's
You can't catch me, I'm too far away

Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco

Bow makes the girls go crazy, they wanna be my lady
How many can I fit in my two-seater Mercedes?
Lime green Lambo, no roof, that's a drop top
They hatin’ ‘cause they girlfriends on my jock

I let her lick the rapper, let her lick the actor
The next Will Smith then I be ballin' like The Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club then don't act up
How can I run out? My money longer than a tour bus

New G shirt
Yellow Lamborghini
BBC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans
Black cars, spendin’ when I hit the mall
Ya can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo, ay!
