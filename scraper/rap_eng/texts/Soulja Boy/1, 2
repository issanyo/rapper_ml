[Intro: Soulja Boy & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Hoodrich Pablo
Soulja (one, two, one, two)
One, two (let's do it)
(Everybody)

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
Come in this bitch, doing one, two
Lean back, nigga, do the one, two
Cut the pack, better get you one, too
Swim move, one, two
Doug E. Fresh with my one, two
Limbo lean back, one, two
Come through with that rockstar, one, two
Sensei, one, two
Cuff them

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Rockstar, pornstar, co-star, trapstar
I come in this bitch, dabbing too hard
Ex man gave her, I'll throw you a card
Double cup, one, two, drinking the raw
Hold on, stop, let me pray to Allah
Thug life, nigga, think like Shakur
I ain't just buy one, I bought two bars
I ain't just popped one, I popped two bars
I come in this bitch doing one, two bars
Geeked out, might stop and look at the stars
There he go with the bullshit, oh Lord
Roll up with Khalifa up at the Ross
Gotta take it, one car, two traps on the boulevard
Put my hood on like I work at a Pull-A-Part
My chopper rock, might catch one, two bumboclaat
One, two pots, call me Sir Mix-a-Lot

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
Come in this bitch, doing one, two
Lean back, nigga, do the one, two
Cut the pack, better get you one, too
Swim move, one, two
Doug E. Fresh with my one, two
Limbo lean back, one, two
Come through with that rockstar, one, two
Sensei, one, two
Cuff them

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Pouring that lean in my Mountain Dew
Pouring the one, then I'm pouring the two
Pull up, Pablo, money out the roof
S.O.D., yeah, that's my crew
Niggas know that I'm having juice
Having gas, shout out my troop
You try this shit and we gon' shoot
Throwing money all out the coupe
Switched the Benz to the Rari
Hopped out the Lambo, I'll never say sorry
Shooting niggas at the party
One, two my forty
One, two got me dabbing
Me and Pablo, we be literally swagging
I pull up in that new Aston
We get to the money, you know we stay gassing

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, yeah
Come in this bitch, doing one, two
Lean back, nigga, do the one, two
Cut the pack, better get you one, too
Swim move, one, two
Doug E. Fresh with my one, two
Limbo lean back, one, two
Come through with that rockstar, one, two
Sensei, one, two
Cuff them
