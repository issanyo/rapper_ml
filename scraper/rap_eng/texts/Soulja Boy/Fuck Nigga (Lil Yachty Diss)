Don't fit the bricks, he hit fifty licks in my spot
I'm riding 'round with that Glock

Middle finger to the cops

Pop a nigga like "hold it"
Ridin' around 'bout four
Got them bricks for the shallow
From zone one to zone four

I'm flexing hard on you haters
Nah, you ain't even know it
Nah, you ain't even know it

[Outro]
It's a thousand dollar pack of lean, you ain't even know it
My A.K. magazine, you ain't even know it
Got hollow tips in my clip, you ain't even know it
You try me, let it rip, you ain't even know it
We turnt up in the club, you ain't even know it
You had money in your pocket, you ain't even throw it
See, Soulja Boy gon' blow, you ain't even know it
I'm riding 'round 'bout four, you ain't even know it
Turn up, turn up

Got Jordans on my feet, you ain't even know it
Get 100K for a beat, you ain't even know it
Got a 9 under my seat, he ain't...
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Nigga, R.I.P
Every day I be deep, Rich Gang
I get money while a nigga sleep, that's O.D
Soulja Boy gonna toke the heat
