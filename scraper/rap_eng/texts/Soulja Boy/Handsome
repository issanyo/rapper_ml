(Intro)
Say I'm Handsome, Say I'm Handsome

(Vers 1)
One day I'm in the trap, next day in the mansion
No Chris Brown but my diamonds dancing
The girls say I look gorgous
And I'm ridin foreign and my shoes Michael Jordan
I'm the freshest that you've ever seen
You ain't gotta ask you know that I'm drinkin lean
Free my niggas in that penitentiary
Mindfucked the world pulled up in a Bently
Zan Zan, Lean Jammin
And your girl say I'm handsome
Ain't DJ Khaled but I'm the best
I don't love your girl but we had sex
It ain't rainin but he got wet
I 5 part my whole set
I threw a temporary tantrum
Pulled up to the club and the girls say I'm handsome

(Hook)
Yeah they say I'm handsome
400 horses when I'm pullin up flexin
Yeah they say I'm handsome
400 polo ralph lauren when I'm flexin
Yeah she say I'm handsome
Yeah she say I'm handsome
Yeah she say I'm handsome
One day in the trap next day I'm in the mansion
Yeah she say I'm handsome
Yeah she say I'm handsome
Yeah she say I'm handsome
One day in the trap next day I'm in the mansion

(vers2)
Now I'm world tourin
2 M's like I won wheel of fortune
And I'm on 4's
Front cover of X X tatted OH MY GOD
And I shot my gun
And that shit was fun
Yeah I'm still on
And I'm flexin hard hit a lick on my phone
Every whip I got a set of chrome
And I set my zone in every song
Made a beat for Tunechi song
And my stones look like honey cone

(Hook)
