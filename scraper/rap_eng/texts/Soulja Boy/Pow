Soulja Boy Tell Em
Runnin With It. Gotta Get A Black Mask
Can't See Me, SouljaBoyTellEm
Im On The Beat. I'm Undefeat. Tid
Did Yo CD Release, Yet, Nope, Don't Think So
Still Reppin West Side Till I Go
Cicero Roll All Way Back To Da Fo
When you Use To Post Up At The Green Sto'
With My Niggas Up On Da Block, Waitin For Da Marta
I Ain't Have A Car Yet, Lookin For Da Charger, Bout To Jump A Rail

Shot Out To My Nigga Antonio. Ima Holla At U Folk
24/7 We Blowin That Smoke

Gotta Whole Gawp On The 10 Trap

SOD Is Shinin Out, Holdin Down My Side Of Town

Screamin' Soulja Boy Is Puttin It Down
And I Ain't Talkin Bout The mifo, Talkin Bout The Fight Show Ice-Chain Look Like A Light Show
