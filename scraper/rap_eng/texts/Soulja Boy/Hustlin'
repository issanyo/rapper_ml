[Verse 1]
Hustling!
Got money in my pocket
I been took off
Just like a rocket
I got 100 bandz stuffed in my robbings [?]
I'm in a Bugatti
I don't move sloppy
With a whip with my wrist
Your bitch jock me
Hop up out the Phantom and the paparazzi snap me
I got bricks underneath the fucking mattress
I got bricks, AK make you do a backflip
My Nigga I be trapping, trapping, packing
Whipping and flipping them chickens (them chickens)
Buggati no expedition
Pushing it to the limit
All my niggas, we running the dope
We running the shit like we sprinting

[Hook]
My Nigga I be hustling, hustling, hustling
My Nigga I be hustling, hustling, hustling
Got money in my pocket,pocket,pocket

Got bandz in my pocket,pocket,pocket
My Nigga I be hustling

[Verse 2]
You already know
Fendi Ferragamo
When i'm shaking down the store
What up with my wrist?
900, Tony Hawk
Walk inside the Louie store, and everything I bought
100 bricks and chickens and they sitting in my vault
I am King Soulja, Nigga what the fuck you thought
He thought he was on but Nigga you gone fell off
Pull up in that Rick Ross
Smoking like a boss
I been chopped the block off, the block off
Lil Dre will get you knocked out,knocked off,knocked off
I flex up in the U-haul chickens in the back though
Ride up in that Maybach, killers will kick your back door

[Hook]
My Nigga I be hustling, hustling, hustling
My Nigga I be hustling, hustling, hustling
Got money in my pocket,pocket,pocket
Got bandz in my pocket,pocket,pocket
My Nigga I be hustling,hustling, hustling
Got money in my pocket,pocket,pocket
Got bandz in my pocket,pocket,pocket
My Nigga I be hustling!
