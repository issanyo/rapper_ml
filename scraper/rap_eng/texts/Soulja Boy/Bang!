Skit (Austin Gibb):

Hey Tommy, it's me, Austin
I just wanted to let you know I’m worried
I'm worried about you hanging out with this Owen Harker kid
I think he's a bad influence
Just don’t do anything I wouldn't do
I'm nervous
Please stay away from Ohark

Verse 1 (One Chain):

Hi, it's Owen Harker
All my raps hot like a fire starter
Got the nice hair and I pull up
Take your girl like I'm better and smarter
Length times width equals pull up, swag
Your mom saw me now she doesn't want your dad
That's bad, I'm hundred times amazing
Did the show, now start the paying
Money in the bank, your girl want cash
Ain’t got a day job but I got cash
I just rap that’s how I got cash
Young Ohark pull up with the cash (Yuhh!)

Verse 2 (Ohark The Bentley God):

I'm a ’Bama fan, I'm a mad man
Ever since the third grade I've been a ladies man
I might swoop, take your girl like oops
That's just what I do
Buy that Bentley, buy your mom a Bentley
She be my new boo
I got cash, head to toe
We gotta go, I’m insane
Bring the pain from the membrane
To the ankle sprain (Like Yuhh!)

Verse 3 (Rated R Rasper)

Hit 'em with the bang, I'm insane
I make it rain
I'll be in the charts
Getting fame with my whole gang
I'mma be a star
Even if I say the same things
Yuhh, yuhh, yuhh, Lump's dad
Wearing three gold chains
Leader of the Frosh team
Underrated rapper too
Kyle Rasper is a god
I just win but haters lose
