[Wanessa]
The sun's down
The night is found
I worked hard for another day
It's time to celebrate
I wouldn't want it another way

And I live my life
Like I've got one day
If tonight is it, then I'll be ok
So DJ won't you play my favorite song?

I'm gonna turn it up now
Turn it up like I've got one day
I'm gonna turn it up now
Everybody let me hear you say
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up


[Soulja Boy]
A 100k on my pockets
I'm taking off like a rocket
If Soulja said let's get it started
I'm always going retarded
They know, my swag is so cool
Me and Wanessa we roll
A red bentley and range rolls
Sitting in 20 inch folls
Go on open the party
A pa-pa-pa party, they're goin' retarded
A Soulja Boy party is a Soulja Boy party
I'm turned
I'm turned up, I'm turned up
I'm turned up
To the maximum!


[Wanessa]
It feels right to be alive
Let it go and dance the night away
Just love and celebrate
I wouldn't want it any other way

And I live my life like
I've got one day
If tonight is it, then I'll be ok
So DJ won't you play my favorite song?

I'm gonna turn it up now
Turn it up like I've got one day
I'm gonna turn it up now
Everybody let me hear you say
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up


[Soulja Boy]
Turned up to the max
I walk in the club wit them rex
It's Soulja tell em I got swag
I get splashed
Rollex on my wrist
Ridin' round thet candy paint
Bentley Wanessa we swagged out on the regular
In the club and I'm turned up
Four wheel all in Brazil this just how it is
Young Soulja worth 30 mil
I'm turned
I'm turned up, I'm turned up
I'm turned up
To the maximum


[Both]
I'm gonna turn it up


[Wanessa]
I'm gonna turn it up now
Turn it up like I've got one day
I'm gonna turn it up now
Everybody let me hear you say
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up
I'm gonna turn it up, up up, up
Turn it up
