[Chorus]
Like the surfboard, caught a wave
Jumped out the coupe, I'm the wave
Stepped out the foreign, I'm the wave
SR coupe, I'm the wave
Like a surfboard, I'm the wave (aye, aye)
Jumped out the coupe, caught a wave
Everybody know I'm the wave
Like a surfboard, caught a wave

[Verse 1]
Yeah, like a surf, I'm the wave
Aye, jumped out the coupe, got Doc' J
Aye, brand new coupe cost a hundred K
Aye, whippin' up dope, Audemars Piguet
Aye, brand new coupe, like the Tesla
Young nigga like to flex like wrestler
Got a whole lot of bricks, crack extra
Pat-a-cake, hot whip, dope flexer
Smoke gas, cookie jar, straight pressure
Aye, I'm a young nigga, don't drive Lexus
Catch me pourin' drink, ooh Texas
Aye, hundred K spent for my necklace

[Chorus]
Like the surfboard, caught a wave
Jumped out the coupe, I'm the wave
Stepped out the foreign, I'm the wave
SR coupe, I'm the wave
Like a surfboard, I'm the wave (aye, aye)
Jumped out the coupe, caught a wave (caught a wave, woo)
Everybody know I'm the wave (Drako)
Like a surfboard, caught a wave (woo)

[Verse 2]
Aye, young nigga like to cash out (woo)
Aye, got a Maserati, had to splash out (woo, woo, woo)
2018 new coupe, bring the cash out
Aye, Young Drako, I'm a cash cow (uh)
Aye, money come in, rollercoaster (woo)
Tats on my skin, just like lotion (yeah)
Young nigga splurge on a Yacht (uh)
Young nigga pocket full of knots (yeah)
Young nigga splurge like a winter coat (woo, woo)
Meet with the plug, talk on a boat (yeah)
Get the price right, need the price low (woo, woo, woo)
Whip it up fast, whip it up slow

[Chorus]
Like the surfboard, caught a wave
Jumped out the coupe, I'm the wave
Stepped out the foreign, I'm the wave
SR coupe, I'm the wave
Like a surfboard, I'm the wave (aye, aye)
Jumped out the coupe, caught a wave (caught a wave, woo)
Everybody know I'm the wave (Drako)
Like a surfboard, caught a wave (woo)
