[Chorus: Ronnie Diez]
I get far attention
Shawty what you want?
Imma beat my meat
Baby what you want?
Got me crazy, got me crazy
Yeah, you so crazy, you so crazy
I get far attention
Shawty what you want?
Imma beat my meat
Baby what you want?
Got me crazy, got me crazy
Yeah, you so crazy, you so crazy

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I pull up in a Maybach
Pinkie ring cost 8 stacks
Lambo, that's mad black
We talk the swag, I'm into that
They damn mad, 'cause I'm hot now
I pull up with the top down
I hop out on gettin' money
Yeah, bottles on my feet
Stay stuntin'
Goin' on a 4
Know I got a check
I keep diamonds in my teeth
Diamonds on my neck
Hop in at the Double O
Know I gotta flex
Goin' out the tax
Goin' out, I'm into that

[Chorus: Ronnie Diez]
I get far attention
Shawty what you want?
Imma beat my meat
Baby what you want?
Got me crazy, got me crazy
Yeah, you so crazy, you so crazy
I get far attention
Shawty what you want?
Imma beat my meat
Baby what you want?
Got me crazy, got me crazy
Yeah, you so crazy, you so crazy
