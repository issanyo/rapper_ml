[Chorus]
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, auto-start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, auto-start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, auto-start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start
Foreign whip, push to start

[Verse One]
Foreign whip, push to start
All the money, trappin' hard
Niggas ain't got no heart
In the hood, servin' through the burglar bars
Shout out to my team
Lamborghini green
Pourin' up a sixteen, court on the sixteenth
Flat screen, HD
All white everything, killers [?]
Pounds of the OG
Ridin' through Zone 3
Nigga, I'm low-key
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! if a nigga approach me
And I'm comin' through your speaker
Kindergarden, had a beeper
In the two-seater with cheetahs
In the hood, I got my heater
Diamonds look like Mona Lisa
My trap got that Soulja fever
I'm flyin' the bricks out to Costa Rica
I got more clips than a motion picture
I fell in love with my desert eagle
Call up Skipper, tell him "bring the pistol"
We throwin' grenades and shootin' missiles
The Margiela footprint is so official
My diamonds is shinin', you cannot miss 'em
Soulja

[Chorus x2]
