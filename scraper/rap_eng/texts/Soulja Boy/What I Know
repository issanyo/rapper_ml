[Intro]
Stats on deck
Money ain't shit
Aye

[Hook]
I put that money over my rubber bands cuz that's what I know
I put the Forgiattos on the Bentley that's what I know
I put rubber bands around all my blue hundreds that's what I know
I stunted and kilt all these pussy niggas that's what I know
That's what I know
That's what I know
That's what I know
That's what I know that's what I know that's what I know
Kilt these pussy niggas stunted that's what I know
I wrapped them rubber bands around all my hundreds that's what I know
That's what I knooowww

[Verse 1]
I pulled up with a big, stupid, bankroll
Me and my niggas gone gold
I want the diamonds on my AP fuck them gold
Aye that what I know
Get the Ferrari and put the Forgiatto's on
I'm responsible for everything and anything I own
I put diamonds I put diamonds on everythang, on everythang

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I wanted to hop on that jet and head to the East Coast
The diamonds on my wrist so froze
I want them to put 300,000 in a bankroll
They looking at me they can't get wit it
If you can't get wit this money what the fuck you gon do nigga?
Cause my niggas ain't stuntin none of your or you nigga
I like the way them rubber bands sit around that blue

[Hook]
