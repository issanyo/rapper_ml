[Intro]
Prez get that money
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line

[Verse 1]
Bad yellow bone, she a freak
Hopped inside the lamb, and I just speed
Diamonds on my neck they like a ski
I just put water on me, freeze me
Diamonds on my neck, I shine one time
I shine two times, I shine three times
When I hit the trap I'm on rewind
Diamonds on my neck a make you blind blind blind
Water on my neck, I ran up a check yeah
What a VVS I just had to ice my neck up
Had to write my check up
Had to get my backup
Had to pull a Porsche truck
I just had to act up

[Chorus]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line

[Verse 2]
Tell em hit my line, tell em hit my line
I got all that cash, It ain't hard to find
I didn't smash that girl, it ain't hard to tell
I just got the bread, put it on the scale
I just got the cash, I just got it cake
I just got the cake nigga, got the cake
My niggas at yo face cause you talking crazy
I'm goin' crazy, pull up new Mercedes
I just get it all, I just put the Porsche, and I skrrt it, uh
Brand new Forgiato, eating benihana
Brand new Forgiato, skrrt it all summer

[Chorus]
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times
Trap one time, trap two times
Trap three times, tell 'em hit my line
Hit my line
