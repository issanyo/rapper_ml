[Intro]
How come you won't tell me what's hannenin'?

[Chorus]
Hannenin', what's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's, what's hannenin'? What's, what's hannenin'?
What's, what's hannenin'? What's, what's hannenin'?
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'

[Verse 1]
Man, tell me, what's really goin' on?
Soulja Boy up in this thing, I'm ready
What's hannenin'?
And I'm ready with the dope
I got a half a mill' stashed in the studio
What's hannenin'?
I'm down, nigga, I'm down
Soulja Boy 2006, it's my time to clown
And I'm ready any place
Soulja Boy up in this thing with my DJ
What's hannenin'?

[Chorus]
Hannenin', what's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannein'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I'm down, down with the thugs
Soulja Boy up in this thing since inches passed DUBs
I'm down with the crew
Lookin' so clean every time I ride through
What's hannenin'?
2006, 2006, my time to shine, hit the block sittin' on  26
2006, 2006, my time to shine, hit the block
What's hannenin'?

[Chorus]
Hannenin', what's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?

[Verse 3]
My turn, my turn to shine
This shit, I swear to God, I'm gonna put it down
I'm gonna do it big
Hit the high school, sittin' on 26
What's hannenin'?
Do it big, I wanna do it big
Do it big, what's hannenin'?
Do it big, I wanna do it big
Do it big, what's hannenin'?

[Chorus]
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', what's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
What's, what's, what's, what's
What's, what's, what's, what's hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
