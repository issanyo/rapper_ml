[Verse 1]
No I ain't doing no interview
Two to three bullets a nigga ain't bulletproof
Fucking yo bitch is what I'm bout to do
Pull up to the trap I'm sitting in the bentley coupe
Mortal kombat finish you
Pass me the pint imma pour a deuce
All of my niggas they animals
Hop out the coupe and they start to shoot
I bought the rave then I dropped the roof
Niggas talking they ain't gon shoot
I got them killers right beside me came from ATL zone 1 zone 2
Tuck in your chain what you better do fuck with soulja boy I'm stacking up revenue
You know that I get to the cake lil nigga
Shoot em choppers at your face lil nigga
Pour up a one then I pour up a dupilar
With the shooters in the Bentley coupe
None of my niggas gon shoot man I dropped the roof

Niggas say they get money man they need to stop it
