[Intro]
Yeah, cut that check, cousin
Suede
That's right, ask me why I ain’t on the Millennium Tour
They ain't got that bag, man, they gotta cut that check for Young Draco, yeah

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my M's, I need my M’s
I need my check, I need my check (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check (Draco, yeah)
I need my M's, I need my M's
I need my check, I need my check (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Cut that check, yeah, VVS my neck, yeah
She so wet, I just jumped off the jet
Pretty boy flex (Ayy), pretty boy drip (Ayy)
Walk up in the club with that stick up on my hip (Yeah)
They call me young Draco, they call me Big Soulja
I put 50 bricks in a new Range Rover
I ride 'round town, drop top Lambo'
Two choppers on me, I'm feelin' like Rambo
Cut that check, pull up and flex
Ice all on my neck, I bought a private jet
I flex and finesse, four mil' on Instagram
Drop the top in that Lamb’, I’m 'bout to go H.A.M

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check (Woo, woo)
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my M’s, I need my M's
I need my check, I need my check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check (Yeah, yeah, Draco)
I need my M's, I need my M's
I need my check, I need my check

[Verse 2]
Ayy, pull up in a Bentley, swagger of the century
Young Draco, I be fresher than a penny
Money on me er’ryday, you already know it
Pull up to the strip club and 50K, I blow it
Whippin' that dope in a microwave, whippin' that dope on a stove
Turn my drip on, lean in the styrofoam
Walk in the club and I pour up a four
Shout out the 1, you know that's my zone
Yeah, jewelry on me so cold, girl blowin' up my phone
And I just jumped off the jet, yeah, ayy
I just told that girl, "Cut a check," yeah, ayy
I just pull up and flex, yeah, ayy
VVS on my necklace

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check (Woo)
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my M's, my M's
I need my check, my check (My percentages)
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my check, I need my check
I need my M's, I need my M's
I need my check, I need my check
Cut that check, cut that check (Yeah)
Cut that check, cut that check (Bitch, bitch)
Cut that check, cut that check (Drip)
Cut that check, cut that check (Drip)
I need my check, I need my check (2019 is my year, nigga)
I need my check, I need my check (Yeah, yeah)
I need my M's, I need my M's (Skrrt)
I need my check, my check (Draco)
