[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Young Drako, nigga I pop out with sticks
Shout out my squad, you know that I made my hood rich
M16 on me when I hop out the whip
Riding on the strip, with a bad bitch
Make the wrong move then you know I'ma empty the clip
Pussy ass nigga, you know you a bitch
Young Drako, nigga I pop out with sticks
Calling the plug to pull up with a brick
Gucci headband, when I walk, I’m rockin' red bottoms
Christian Louboutin, nigga I got a hundred fifty thousand
Walk in with the drip, that's the sauce, I got thousand island
Me and Asian Doll, yeah we ball, in that new Ferrari
Skrrt the Hellcat, fishtail, or the Maserati
Fuck it, do the digi’ dash, Lambo or new Bugatti
In New York on the Breakfast Club, I took off like a rocket
I got a quarter million cash, I can't fit it in my pocket

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
No, I can't fit it in my pocket
Got a quarter million cash, I can't fit it in my pocket
My and Asian Doll took off like a rocket
You ain't getting money like us, nigga stop it

[Verse 2: Asian Doll]
You wasn't calling shots, I was 18 and we were ballers
Pussy nigga, stop that hating and shit, the reason niggas falling
You ain't on shit, money grew a little taller
Put a nigga in position, nigga still had to follow it
You ain't got a mind of a gangsta
Smoke dope, drive Beamers
I was broke, came up, I’m famous (Aye)
First time saw a kilo, knew to keep that on the d-low
My handgun straight, these bitches pump fake, [?], my hood gazebo
My money gon talk cause the bullshit walk
I’m rich, these niggas little pillows
Spend that check myself, bitch
Made that mil' myself, bitch
Bitch be on my hit list
She done talk a rich bitch
I count guap, my fit sick
Gucci signed me, it’s lit, bitch
I drip candy on my paint
Asian bout it, bitches ain't
Bitch, you mean it, fuck you think?
I'm from Texas, sippin' drank

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
No, I can’t fit it in my pocket
Got a quarter million cash, I can't fit it in my pocket
My and Asian Doll took off like a rocket
You ain't getting money like us, nigga stop it

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
