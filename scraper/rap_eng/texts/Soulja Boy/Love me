Verse 1: Soulja Boy
Girl you think that you know
But you really dont know
Where did you go
Saw you at the show
We make love on the floor
And take you nd wanna go
But you already know
That you really dont know
Im driving through the city
You shouldn't be with me
But its all gucci, can we make a movie
Sippin something dark
????
Girl you know I love you
Nothing above you

Chorus:
Now tell me that you love me, now tell me that you love me
Now tell me that you love me, tell me that you love me, that you love me
Tell me that you love me, that you love me tell me that you love me (1x)

Verse 2: Soulja Boy
Girl whats on yo mind
Tell me whats on yo mind
Cause I wanna know
Lighting up the Dro
Everything we go through...
But it could get better...

Verse 3: Soulja Boy
She like the way I lean
She thinks shes in a dream
Nothing comes in between
Tell me that you Love Me
And if I ever hurt you once before you know I didn't mean too
And if I ever had a time that I didn't treasure you

Chorus:
Now tell me that you love me, now tell me that you love me
Now tell me that you love me, tell me that you love me, that you love me that you love me
Tell me that you love me, that you love me tell me that you love me (1x)
