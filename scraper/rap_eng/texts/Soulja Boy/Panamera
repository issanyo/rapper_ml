[Chorus]
I pull up in a Panamera
Drop the top off the Panamera
Get my dick sucked in Panamera
Pourin' lean in a Panamera
Do a drive-by in a Panamera
I pulled up in a Panamera
Countin' dirty money in a Panamera
Load my Glock in a Panamera
Count guap in the Panamera
I'm getting top in a Panamera

[Verse One]
Young nigga [?]
I pull up in the Panamera
Young nigga in the Panamera
Flexin' up in the Panamera
Candy white on my Panamera
Sellin' that dope through America
Yeah, nigga, I be flexin'
Yeah, nigga, I be flexin'
Yeah, nigga, I be flexin'
Yeah, nigga, I be flexin'
Countin' money in a Panamera
Countin' money in a Panamera
So much money all in the air
Throw a hundred thousand, nigga, I don't care
I'm a young nigga so you know I splurge
Sittin' back in a Panamera
Drop the top off the Porsche
Roof, yeah, got divorced
Don't ask the price, I'd afford
I don't ask the price, I can afford it
I don't ask the price, I can afford it
Balenciaga, no Jordans
Don't ask the price, I can afford it
Don't ask the price, I can afford it
Balenciaga, no Jordans
Whole lotta lean pourin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'm rich as fuck in a Panamera
Worth twenty plus in a Panamera
These niggas talkin', these niggas scary
They shootin' shots up in the air
Fifty K my chandelier
Young nigga, I'm gettin' money
My [?]
Click clack [?]
Bright day, right now
Got young niggas comin'
Young niggas gunnin'
Young niggas shooters
Young nigga movement
I got young nigga shooters
It's a young nigga movement
I flex hard, nigga, everyday
My whole squad, we gettin' cake
Shootin' niggas up in they face
Catch the case, then beat the case
Hundred K in the Panamera
I'm sellin' dope all through America
Pull up, these bitches starin'
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Yeah, nigga
Rich Gang
Ten pints, ten pounds, roll up
It's a done deal, nigga

[Chorus]
