[Chorus]
Bitch nigga wait, bitch nigga yeah
Keep tough, this shit blow your head off the shoulders
Soulja Boy tell 'em breakin' down like folders
Know the Soulja, rollin' like a coaster
Bitch nigga wait, bitch nigga yeah
Keep tough, this shit blow your head off the shoulders
Soulja Boy tell 'em breakin' down like folders
Know the Soulja, rollin' like a coaster
Rollin' like a coaster, rollin' like a coaster
Rollin' like a coaster, rollin' like a coaster
Rollin' like a coaster, rollin' like a coaster
Rollin' like a coaster, rollin' like a coaster

[Verse]
Run up on me wrong, put that Glock to your head
You pussy ass niggas got me twisted like a dread
I'm a boss, if I say it, then it's done like Simon say it
If you don't do what I say, then that Glock gon' hit yo face
Bitch, my last name is Way, so I have it my way
Bitch I have it today, now tomorrow bitch that's yesterday
I'm on another plane, headed to another show
That lil' bitch rockin' in the studio
Bitch love my fucking hits, my fucking tracklist
I'm a mothafuckin' boss, you the mothafuckin' bitch
Used to snitch, why the fuck you tryna dare me?
Soulja tell 'em high in a mothafuckin' mountain
Sippin' on Mountain, too, bitch what it do?
I thought you niggas knew, now get your fucking tools
Run up on me wrong, Glock now hit your stomach
Make you niggas vomit, I'm higher than [?]
Nigga get cromped, nigga get shot, nigga get stomped
Run up on me wrong, don't get jumped
Fuck what you niggas talkin' 'bout, tell that nigga to walk it out
Run up on me wrong, Glock now gon' hit your fuckin' mouth
Blowin' the jaws, I'm blowin' off your elbow
Break a nigga's bones, bitch nigga hello
Goodbye
