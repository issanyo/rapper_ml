[Intro: Soulja Boy & K$upreme]
Soulja
I'm high
Skrt, yeah
Phlex'n
You know I'm high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Clip look long like a limousine (Clips)
I mix the codeine with the promethazine (Drank)
Been in the field since sixteen (Sixteen)
Carhartt tee with the Rick jeans (Ricky)
Wake up and stick to the seventeen
I get the guap by any means (Flll, beep)
Lot of guns on me like I'm a Marine (Bow, grah)
I hit my first juug in 2014
She be my one night, but that is your queen
Addicted to money, bitches, and weed
I gotta ride with my gun on the front seat (Bow)
She get to cappin', I put her on Front Street (Bitch)
Talkin' my shit 'cause I can take the heat (Take it, KPreme)
AR-15, sound like a drumline beat (Brr)
One point five K, I spend it on my feet
Gucci pyjamas, I drip when I sleep (Drip)

[Verse 1: K$upreme]
Designer is on me (Designer, fll, beep, KPreme)
It's on me (Beep)
Fuckin' your bitch and it's on
Like I'm stirrin' up macaroni (Damn, wait)
I mix Chanel with the Stoney (Chanel)
I don't wanna fuck her, she boney (Ugh)
Scarface, feel like I'm Tony (Scarface)
You gotta pay what you owe me (Fll, beep, beep)
Kickin' this shit like a goalie (Kickin' it)
Blockin' that bitch like a goalie (Block that bitch)
I go way back with my homies (Yee)
Don't fuck with niggas, they phoney (Fuck 'em)
Ballin' on niggas, I feel like I'm Kobe (Ballin')
Pourin' two fours like I'm Kobe (Lean, swish)
Need the sweats on me, I'm cozy (Bitch)
Get out my bed, you too nosy (Bitch, sheesh)

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Clip look long like a limousine (Clips)
I mix the codeine with the promethazine (Drank)
Been in the field since sixteen (Sixteen)
Carhartt tee with the Rick jeans (Ricky)
Wake up and stick to the seventeen
I get the guap by any means (Flll, beep)
Lot of guns on me like I'm a Marine (Bow, grah)
I hit my first juug in 2014
She be my one night, but that is your queen
Addicted to money, bitches, and weed
I gotta ride with my gun on the front seat (Bow)
She get to cappin', I put her on Front Street (Bitch)
Talkin' my shit 'cause I can take the heat (Take it, KPreme)
AR-15, sound like a drumline beat (Brr)
One point five K, I spend it on my feet
Gucci pyjamas, I drip when I sleep (Drip)

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Gang, nigga, we ain't on that stupid shit (No)
Draco extended, it look like a ruler clip
Gang, nigga, that's who you ain't fuckin' with (Gang)
Hop out the double R, nigga, I'm bustin' shit (Hop out)
Roll up the Backwood, you know I got runts in there, OG shit (Roll up)
Make a wrong move and I empty the whole clip (Whole clip)
VVS diamonds, I bust out my whole wrist (Ice)
Pull up, you holler and I get off the low quick (Gang)
I'm on a private jet with a hundred bricks (Ooh)
VVS diamonds are water, splash, drip (Drip)
Water my bust down (Woah)
Water, VVS, drip, drop, drip (Drip)
Make the wrong move, I air it out quick (Rah)
Hell nah, I ain't fuck your bitch (No)
But she was suckin' my dick
Hundred-fifty thousand and it came for a new Richard Mille

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Clip look long like a limousine (Clips)
I mix the codeine with the promethazine (Drank)
Been in the field since sixteen (Sixteen)
Carhartt tee with the Rick jeans (Ricky)
