[Soulja Boy on the Hook]
Jump out the jet, I was breakin my wrists, hit the private jet with bricks its time to take a trip
All of my niggas we juggin finnesing
17 wit the choppa wasn't having no sense
Tryna hit a lick with a thirty on my hip
Try to ride me ima empty the clip
I guess he mad cause im fuckin his bitch
Hit the highway its time to take a trip
Zone 1 lil nigga we savages
Sixteen quarter mill I was having it
Spent a hundred thousand dollars on Actavis
In the trap, with that pack and I’m cappin’ it
10 bales, no scales know its accurate
In the trap, hit the pop with the spatulas
Shorty i can't stop, you know that im blastin em
Young rich nigga, took a trip out to africa

[King Reefa- Verse 1]
Hunnid Pounds, got that shit for the dirty cheap
Me and soulja trappin hard, like I'm trappin me
Im tryna bark at these hoes, it ain't happening
King Reefa, I'm posted with savages
Call up Go Yayo, he bringin' them hoes
All these chickens all up in the room
Dirty bricks in the ash tray
King Reefa got glass trays
Post in the trap and you know how I'm givin it
Bitch I been walking with lean and I'm sippin it
Been in the trap and you know I'm just livin it
Bitches they love me, no way that im fibbin' it
Money bags like im Yayo
Hunnid bricks by the case loads
Call up king soulja he pull in the rover
You know that these hoes do what we say so
