(Hook)
Pull up on your block, gratata
Call up my shooters, they come thru’
And yeah, they pop at ya
Money comin’ in, it ain’t no stoppin’ us
SOD the gang, bitch, you know we there

Pull up on your block, gratata
Call up my shooters, they come thru’
And yeah, they pop at ya
Pull up on yo block and they droppin’ ya
SOD the gang, bitch, ain’t shit stoppin’ us

(Verse)
Pull up on your block, gratata
Shooters in the back and the front
And yeah, they pop at ya
All my niggas comin’, boy, they droppin’ ya

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Calling all my shooters and yeah they pop at ya
We pull up big guns and we chop you off
SOD the gang, bitch ya know wassup

My dad was a hustler
Standin’ on the block, sellin’ dope

Pull up on yo block and ya know I bust
Forgiatto sittin’ underneath my brand new Bentley truck
Pull up to the trappin’, they like what the fuck
Fuck 12, fuck the police, they ain’t none’ to us
SOD the gang and my gun I trust
Pull up on yo block and let it bust

(Hook)
