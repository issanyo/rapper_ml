Keep a lot of birds like a zoo, zoo
Made a couple mill' off YouTube
Hop inside my Prosche, it go zoom zoom
Everything I rock and I own is that new new
Keep a lot of birds like a zoo, zoo
Made a couple mill' off YouTube
Hop inside my Porsche, it go zoom zoom
Everything I rock and I own is that new new

[Verse 1]
Keep a lot of birds like a zoo, zoo
Meet me at the trap what it do, do?
AP on my wrist, that's that new new
Catch me in my 'hood, and I'm ridin' in that old school
I'm a boss man, that other nigga fool, fool
Man I'm the shit, doo doo
Customise my stone's, yeah it's new new
Real friends, where they at? Nigga I'm the new troop
What it is, Audemar on my wrist
And I turnt up with my whole clique
When I walk in the club, gon' pour it up
... man, I got this money, got 'em showin' love

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pulled up, Audemar cost a rack
Half a brick spent, I'mma make it back
Customized my stones, everything on
Ridin' through my city, and that drank in my Styrofoam
Man, you already know what it do
Chain on my neck, yeah that's new new
I'm a boss, don't sell dog food
Catch me in the 'hood hittin' licks, what it is, dude?
Keep a lot a chickens like a zoo, zoo
Keep a lot a birds like a zoo, zoo
Keep a lot a dogs like a zoo, zoo
Everything on my neck straight is that new new
