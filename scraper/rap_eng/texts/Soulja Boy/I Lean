[Intro: Prodigy & Soulja Boy]
I lean
Soulja Boy Tell Em, Mindless behavior
(I lean) Watch me, watch me
Aye, aye
I lean, watch me do it
I lean (Soulja Boy Tell em)

[Chorus: Mindless Behavior]
She like the way I lean
You know I had to do it
Shawty, she so fine
Man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it, lose it, lose it
She's about to lose it
Shawty, she's so fine
Man, my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Got her nickname on her necklace
That's a gold
I love the way her polish
Make her nails look like they glow
I can tell she fly when she ain't got nowhere to go
She keep that hair and makeup like she's staring in a show
Want to see what she got on that say party tho
We get turnt up on the floor
She wanna have me on the low
Why pretty girls don't dance no more?
When I'm on girl say gone girl
I know she will be rolling, rolling, rolling

[Chorus: Mindless Behavior]
She like the way I lean
You know I had to do it
Shawty, she so fine
Man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it, lose it, lose it
She's about to lose it
Shawty, she's so fine
Man, my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it

[Pre-Verse: Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy Tell Em
Shawty so fine, one of a kind
Looking so sexy, always on my mind
Shawty's so turnt up
Turn around and drop it
I wanna see you move it
Turn around and pop it

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Baby put her technique on display
She do it like she practice in the mirror every day
You know she start to feel it
When she flip away her bangs
All her girls giggle
But the homies be like "dang"
What-about, what about one more time?
That's whats up
Chop real talk now back it up
Rep yo city, give it up
Light off lights on and we switching up
Bounce to the left side, right side
She drop it, then she roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it

[Chorus: Mindless Behavior]
She like the way I lean
You know I had to do it
Shawty, she so fine
Man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it, lose it, lose it
She's about to lose it
Shawty, she's so fine
Man, my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ, run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it

[Bridge: Prodigy & Roc Royal]
Hello? What's up?
We all turnt up (So gone)
When you decide to lose your mind
(Uh, let me get it, Prod)
What's up with cha
You in here with yo sister
She having all the fun
And you taking all the pictures
I think you're the prettiest one
Never met no girl like you

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
(Roc, let me tell em)
Shawty, you so cool
You know what to do, yeah
Baby girl said she got a thing for young dudes
Notice that I stay with brand new chains
And brand new shoes
Snapback, white tee, and a iPad
She like the way I lean, baby girl you bad
Lets chill, and watch a movie and do what we do
Baby, girl you so hot, welcome to the crew
I like the way you move it, I like the way you pop it
So you should keep on going and you shouldn't stop it

[Chorus: Mindless Behavior]
She like the way I lean
You know I had to do it
Shawty, she so fine
Man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it, lose it, lose it
She's about to lose it
Shawty, she's so fine
Man, my game is stupid, stupid, stupid
DJ run that music
I can read her mind and she's about to lose it

[Outro: Prodigy]
Hey, hey
She like the way we lean
Oh, yeah
