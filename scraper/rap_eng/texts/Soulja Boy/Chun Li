Kicking shit like Chun Li
Selling brick, sippin' lean, kicking shit like Chun Li

They got the trap on fire
Young nigga post up like Street Fighter
Riding the Lamb on the wire
I got that Lambo on fire
I got yo' house on fire
Run in yo' house like Street Fighter
I got that trap on fire, I got that strap on fire
I got snapped by the paparazzi
I was ridin' on a Kawasaki
Money comin' on me, on my body
Tattoos on my body, yeah she on my body
Hop in the molly, we up in Folly's
Hop on the Mazi I take off the Maserati
And you know that they got the Ducati
Young Soulja Boy, I don't go to the money
Go to the money, I go get the money
Kicking shit like I'm Chun Li nigga

Sipping on lean an (?) the clear

[Hook]
I dare a pussy nigga try me

Kicking shit like Chun Li
Selling brick, sippin' lean, kicking shit like Chun Li

[Verse 2]
Run in yo' house just like home alone
Pouring lean in my Styrofoam
Pussy nigga talking on the internet
I'm a send my killers straight to his home
AK 47 hit in his dome

He thought he was on, but now that nigga gone
Now they blowing my phone
Shout out my OG, he put me on

Pussy nigga better not come to my zone
Made a million dollars off of my phone

Nigga talking better pray to his reverend

Hopped in the Lambo and switched to the 6th gear!
Young Soulja Boy I count big bills!
