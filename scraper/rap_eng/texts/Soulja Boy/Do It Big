Inertia {*echoes*}

[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Soulja, 2010 turn me up
Soulja Boy TellEm
S.O.D. money gang mane
I do it B-I-G mane!

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Man I do it big! From the cars to the clothes to the crib
Man I do it big! Fifty million, a hundred million's how I live
Man I do it big! ... Get it in
Man I do it B-I-G, big, B-I-G, big

[Soulja Boy]
All I do is stunt, eatin rappers up for lunch
I got a million albums sold, congratulations, well done
Soulja's heatin like a drum, and I made the club go dumb
It don't matter where you from, long as you stay stuntin
I press a button in my Coupe and watch the car transform
I turn the haters on you, blast my speakers 'til they learn
I spit flames on the mic fryin you bound to get burned
After I finish stuntin then you know it's Mini-Me turn
S.O.D., is the label, on 50 rich the fable
Tryin to stunt like me, but I know that you ain't able
From internets and cable, from my hood to Asia
I hit the stunt button now watch me count my paper
I cain't, hear a hater, I cain't, be one either
Rubbin ice on my ice cause my chain got a fever
Stunt like Evel Knievel, Beanie hat no Sigel
Good over evil, I pull off in a Regal

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Soulja Boy]
My style is so different, my flow is prolific
Girls on my tip cause I'm a pro at business
And I don't be limpin, I ain't never been shot
But I will shoot any rapper who, come try to take my spot
My buzz is so hot, I got the internet locked
Ask them wannabe goons who tried to run inside my spot
I hit the stunt button and all of that stopped
In my whip hittin donuts for them hungry ass cops
Is that all that you got? Man my chain is enormous
Shittin on the beat, like the beat is a toilet
I see they tried to ignore it, but they gotta face it
A million dollars cash bitch I spent that on my bracelet

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Soulja Boy]
3:15 man my trunk go bump {*7X*}

[Hook] - repeat 2X
