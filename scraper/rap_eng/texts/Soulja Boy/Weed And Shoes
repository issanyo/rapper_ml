Back then dude need the cash to borrow
But these days the Maserati and the Murcielago
Crash the benz today I cop another tomorrow
Or maybe get the Ferrari 360 or the Gallardo
Young Soulja, even back then I had swag then
Not too many stores that you can name I ain't drop cash in
80 thousand G stacks in the locker that was back then
I took off on them haters ain't been back since

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes

Well check the mixtape blogs, I'm on fire man
Just copped the Audi R8, bought it from Iron Man
Just scooped yo chick real quick she like the tires man
She be fiendin' for the D, I supplier man
New kicks New T, I dress proper man
Asked her if she got a man, She said that she forgot her man
He did what? Tell 'em that I'm not a fan, Soulja pop a lot bands
And yeah I got a lot of fans, Everythang gold from the chain to the mouth piece
We can go East stay chilling on South Beach
And if you wanna go you can be with me
Smoke weed play 360
Everywhere I go you could take flicks with me
Over seas man you can take that trip with me
Make a stop in flight club cop kicks with me
Inhale till the bag's empty, Aha!
