You go hard, I go the hardest
Let us bow our head for swag father
Soulja wrote the book, I'm the author
Five chains on, came out the water
When you get old you become the target
Money on deck, bitch don't get me started
Got ten chains, now they say I'm cocky
When I drop my album, watch them niggas copy
Zan with that lean I fell out the dream
Pretty boy king bitch you know what
I mean & I pull up in the city Lambo tangerine in green God damn
