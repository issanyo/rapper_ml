[Chorus]
Young nigga trappin, you know I got birds
Hop in the Rari, you know I swerve
Hop in that Lambo, you know I swerve
Ball like Larry Bird
Ball like Larry Bird
Ball like Larry Bird
Ball like Larry Bird
Ball like Larry Bird

[Verse]
Trap out that Hellcat, I trap out that Demon
Young nigga pull up, you know that I'm schemin'
I go to LA and I ball like LeBron
Shout out my niggas, they pull up with drum
Talkin' that shit and I'm straight out the slum
Westside nigga, you know it's Zone 1
All of my niggas they pull up and, uh
Hop out the bedroom you know we stunt
Shout out my nigga, you know that they kill a real nigga
You know that I go hard in the paint
Sippin' on lean, I'm pourin' up drank
Nigga's so high, I can't even think
Look at the rollie, you know it don't tick or don't tock
Shout out my nigga, got bricks and the guap
Fuck 12, don't fuck with the cops
I got a yacht and it post on the docks

[Chorus]
Ooh, ball, yes, like I'm Larry Bird (yeah)
Hop inside the Rari (yeah), then you know I swerve
Ball, just like Larry Bird
Just like Larry Bird
Ball, just like Larry Bird
