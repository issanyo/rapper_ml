[Intro]
Yah, yah, yah, ey, ey, you already know, Soulja

[Hook]
I drop the top on the lamb and did the whole dash
I was high of zans on most crash
Got a lotta money on me, say a nigga boomin'
Catch me in the trap, 30 on a niggas jews, man
Niggas talkin' all that shit, but they know im on
Im countin' money, smokin' dope with the roof gone
Lotta cash on me, y'all ready know
Im a rich ass nigga with a bank roll


[Verse 1:]
Drop the top on the lamb the i did the dash (x3)
I was high of zans on most crash
Young nigga with me, know i got cash
You ain't even got an ass, know i got a bag
Young nigga know im rich and im too uhhh
Im blowin' dope, countin' money with the roof gone
Catch me in that new Shevy, that bitch too toned
Nigga disrespect the gang, get that nigga gone
On the plug, talkin' money on my selfphone
Gotta whole lotta cash in my trap home
Lil' Soulja Boy tell' em, know i right chrome
Nigga snitchin' you know they got tap-phones
Lil' Soulja Boy know i get a lotta Banz
Niggas hatin' on me cause im goin up on Instagram
10 Chainz on my neck with a lotta cash
Poppin' zans, poppin' zans, outta most crash


Drop the top on the lamb and i did the dash (x3)
I was high of the zans on most crash
You ain't even got an ass, know i got Banz
Im a young rich nigga keep a lotta cash
Niggas hatin' in the trap, so i keep the strap

On the phone, count money, strap in my lap (x3)
You already know that nigga to uhhh
Im in the coup, blowin' dope, got my mind gone
In the buss, smokin' dope, in my damn zone
Got a lotta AK's in my damn home
Nigga disrespect Dre, imma kill him
Nigga snitchin' on a hood, we dont feel that
Whole lotta snake niggas, that ain't no good
Got called and he snitched on a whole hood


Drop the top on the lamb and i did the dash (x4)
Yea, get money, fuck bitches, that's what they told me
Snake ass nigga snitched on my OG
In the trap whippin' work, yea whole key
Get money, pull up on yo black with the heat
In the streets, you can catch me with the 30 clip
Nigga disrespect, they can get them holla-tips
Pull up to the trap, know a nigga hood rich
Catch me in the hood, spot postin' with the hood bitch
30 thousand on my motherfucking bracelet
Im gettin' money, man them niggas gotta face it
Im gettin' money, man i know them niggas hatin'
I dont give a fuck, man you know a nigga pay man
Pull up to the trap know a nigga gettin' K
Disrespect the squad, get hit with the 38
A lotta money in my trap, get upon my way
If you ain't talkin' money, get the fuck upon my face
Coped a rollie on my wrist and it was bust down
I hit the city on the block and im like what now
Them niggas high on the block and im like what now
2 hands in the air like i scored a touch down
50 clip on a round, let the nigga get it
Disrespectin' of Soulja, know im stacking millions
Nigga talking bout they gettin', they ain't gettin' shit
Broke ass nigga in the block, ain't hittin' list


Drop the top on the lamb and i did the dash (x3)
I was high of zans on most crash
Young rich nigga know i got a lotta Banz
You ain't gotta ask me, you know i get a lotta cash


Drop the top on the lamb and i did the dash (x4) ...
