[Chorus: Soulja Boy] (x2)
I, I, I, I Be so High (so High)
So, so fly (so fly)
Above the clouds
I, I, I Got Da Swag Flu
I, I, I Be so clean (so so clean)
New Jeans (new jeans)
Look, look at me, I, I, I, I Got da Swag Flu

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Hopped up out the Lambo
With my top down (top down)
Soulja tellem, I'm spending hot shit
Tell that to the birdman (man)
Shout out to the cash
Man we holding down...
Every song that I drop I spit that knowledge
I pull up to my mansion and it's bigger than a college
Ya boy spending cash every second every minute
When it come to the stunting dog it ain't no...
Sipping on the bottle until that bitch empty
Bottle after bottle yeah I got plenty
I'm just getting started ain't no where near...
The chain on my neck cost two drop top,..

[Chorus: Soulja Boy] (x2)
I, I, I, I Be so High (so High)
So, so fly (so fly)
Above the clouds
I, I, I Got Da Swag Flu
I, I, I Be so clean (so so clean)
New Jeans (new jeans)
Look, look at me, I, I, I, I Got da Swag Flu

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Swisha, sweets, money on the fee
Hundred on the sheet
Call the f-50 a piece
Condo suites, Versace sheets
Cold whip game, candy am a hundred each
My type hot drop top sunny nights
Cash money life, popping bottles hopping flights
Versace shades, baby got this money to blow
And she know it so I bought her to this marble floor

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Holiday everyday in this high life
Red hot lights and smash on site
Spending how you feel
Always daddy, life is priceless
Strapped in that... candy

[Chorus: Soulja Boy] (x2)
I, I, I, I Be so High (so High)
So, so fly (so fly)
Above the clouds
I, I, I Got Da Swag Flu
I, I, I Be so clean (so so clean)
New Jeans (new jeans)
Look, look at me, I, I, I, I Got da Swag Flu
