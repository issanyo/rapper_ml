[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Ayy, yeah

[Chorus]
Lambo push to start, look like Robocop
Flashlights when I'm pullin' out
All you see is diamonds shinin' in the dark
Yeah, yeah
Push to start, look like Robocop
See these headlights when I'm backin' out
All you see is diamonds shinin' in the dark
I press one button and it go apart
I press one button, touch one like Robocop
Push to start, goin' hard
Headlights when I be pullin' off
Press one button and watch it pull apart

[Verse]
Push to start, can't hold me down
Hold me down, that's my lonely
Ridin' through Zone 1 in my lonely
Ridin' Zone 1
That push to start, Decepticon
Lot of money, checks foreign, Decepticon
Big diamonds, flex like Megatron
All hundreds, you don't see no ones
You know I'm number one
No L, I already won
Before it end, already begun
I shoot the Chopper, that's my favorite gun

[Chorus]
Push to start, look like Robocop
A lot of headlights when I'm pullin' out
VVS diamonds shinin' in the dark
Press one button, pull apart
Push to start, look like Robocop
A lot of diamonds shinin' in the dark
Nothin' but headlights when I'm pullin' out
Press one button, it pull apart

[Outro]
I transform, the girls swarm
A lot of bae under my arm
80 thousand for Rollie
VVS flawless, water me
H20, can't slow down
Try the gang, you know it go down
Big K's, no pronoun
Lot of dough, you know it now
