[Intro]
You already know it's your folk Soulja Boy on the track
I'm back again
Ay, it's going down
Y'all gots stacks on deck
Ay, yah

[Hook x2]
If you know you getting money
Pull out a hundred
Make it rain on them haters who be thinking that you're fronting
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I got money, cars, clothes, ice
Step off in this spot fresh with Miami Mike
Stacks on deck and yeah,  you already know
I can do my dance fast or I can do it in slow-mo
I can make it rain on them or I can make it snow
When I go shopping, man I buy the whole store
Soulja, Boy, ain't, broke
I be fresh up on the scene
With the monkeys on my toes

[Hook x2]
If you know you getting money
Pull out a hundred
Make it rain on them haters who be thinking that you're fronting
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I got stacks on deck
And money in the bank
I fresh everything wit the coca-cola paint
Counting up stacks looking 4 a money clip
I'm a very important person so I'm sitting in the rear
Girls gon' strip
And fans gon' call
On the internet got them jumping off the wall
Grill in my mouth so I got a smile on my face
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, hit me up on MySpace

[Hook x2]
If you know you getting money
Pull out a hundred
Make it rain on them haters who be thinking that you're fronting
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks

[Bridge x2]
Throw your money (Throw your money)
Throw your money (Throw your money)
If you're holding bout a stack, throw your money (throw your money)

[Bridge x2]
Make it rain (Make it rain)
Make it rain (Make it rain)
If you're holding bout a stack make it rain (Make it rain)

[Hook x2]
If you know you getting money
Pull out a hundred
Make it rain on them haters who be thinking that you're fronting
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks
Holla stacks on deck, stacks
Stacks on deck, stacks

[Outro]

Stacks on deck E.E.T
