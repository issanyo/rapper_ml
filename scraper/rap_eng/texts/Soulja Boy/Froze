[Hook]
Smashin you draw, my wrist in the water like its on the bowl
Hop out the Rari, I never say sorry, my necklace on froze
Do not step to close to my chain, you might catch a cold
I just made it rain, 30 thousand on the floor
I just walked up in the party
Red bottoms and balenciagas on my joggers
Drippin' on the red carpet
When they see me and they lose control
Hop in the Rari, I rode
In the trap turn on the stove
Kinda go 50, drive through the city
All of my diamonds so cold

[Verse]
Kinda go 50, i drive through the city
I feel like Im Diddy, I slide with the CD
I jump out the Bentley and count up a milli
I just be drippin, and ran of a ticket
I just be walkin, the sauce on me drippin'
I just walk in and i bought a million
Sippin' on lean, it's all on my kidney
No court nigga, im havin' a million
Pick up the truck, it came from Italy
I struck the Bentley truck through the trenches
Spray the jacuzzi and I shoot like im Pimpy
I can't really wait to make a billion
Catch me coolin' in the club with your bitch
55 thousand of ice on my wrist
Walk in the club, a young nigga drip
All on the table, I sit in the VIP
I'm a boss nigga, I trap at the mansion
VVS Diamonds, they on me they dancin'
Pull up in Casper, Hop out the Phantom
I take an 8 and pour it in my Fanta
Bentley truck, ride now slide through Atlanta
Hit the pot with an arm and a hammer
