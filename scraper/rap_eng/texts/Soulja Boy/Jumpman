Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country
Pull up in my Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, know Soulja getting money, Wow
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
Pull up in that Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, you know I’m getting money
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country

[Verse One]
Flexing flexing flexing flexing, know I’m flexing
Pull up in that Lambo and I’m swerving reckless
Hop up out the ‘Rari, jump up in a Bentley
They say “Soulja, you the trapper of the century”, Ungh
Pull up to the club, you know I’m sipping D’usse, Ungh
Take your bitch, then I turn up in her pussy, Wow
Flexing in the club, [?] pouring up lean, Wow
We been sipping Actavis, it got me leaning now
I just hit a big lick, Ohh
Found a pint of Actavis, Ohh
Standing in the kitchen, whipping, working with my wrist
Put a hundred thousand on that we’ll fuck your bitch

[Hook]
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country
Pull up in my Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, know Soulja getting money, Wow
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
Pull up in that Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, you know I’m getting money
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country

[Verse Two]
Call my jeweler, twenty thousand for my earring
I just spent a thousand dollar on a ashtray
Pull up to the club in a brand new Aston
Papparazzis on me, cameras steady flashing
Hundred thousand likes on my Instagram
In the trap, whip my wrist, I’m going ham
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Nikes
Sipping on that lean, bad bitch, you like me
We talking ‘bout a hundred pints, that’s that plug talk
Walk inside the club, then I hit my Blood walk
Thousand dollar shoes, yeah, that’s Giuseppe walk
Walk inside the house, Ferragamo on my carpet

[Hook]
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country
Pull up in my Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, know Soulja getting money, Wow
Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman
Pull up in that Lambo, drop the top, I’m stunting
You ain’t got to ask, you know I’m getting money
I just hit the blunt and took off out the country

[Outro]
We talking ‘bout a hundred pints, that’s that plug talk
Walk inside the club, then I hear my Blood walk
Thousand dollar shoes, yeah, that’s Giuseppe walk
Walk inside the house, Ferragamo on my carpet
