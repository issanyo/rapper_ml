[Soulja Boy]
I do my thing pull up rolling that swisher
Got my young niggas on me, bitches taking them pictures
Kodak moment when you see me cause my whole clip loaded
SOD, I'm like the bomb then that nigga exploded
And that pistol is toted
2K holding the Glock
.45 and I hit the block and that bitch so hot
Pop a collar my nigga, I'm like a pimp on dro
Got a young ass nigga and that bitch is cooking up doe
.44 When I hit the block and I'm rolling up swishers
And them young ass niggas got them young ass killers
Got a young ass goon, nigga 15 years old
With a uzi automatic and it's bigger than swole
Shoot in his nose
Got my young niggas with me
And we gonna shoot that bitch until that motherfucker empty
And I'm holding the semi, I got 8 on my plate
And 9 came in and punched his ass straight in his face
BasedGod on my side
Make a nigga remember
And my jewels froze like its the middle September
For you hate ass, fake ass, bitch ass, snitch ass busters
I'm aiming at the temple for you weak ass motherfuckers
My niggas rolling deep and you know we be riding
SOD we got the money and you know we gonna divide it
I got niggas on my team, real niggas that's hustling
SOD we getting money for you trick ass busters
