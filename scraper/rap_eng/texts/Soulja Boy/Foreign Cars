[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be kush smokin' car ride
She said she like how my car ride
I'm in foregin cars now
300 we some stars now
Buying out the bar now
Bitch I'm living large now
Got so high I see stars now
Bitch I'm in foreign cars now

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I be kush smokin' car ride
Take his bitch for a car ride
A lot of tattoos on my arms now
Bitches wanna fuck my arms now
All I rock is Louie now
Truies and some Gucci now
Getting bitches wet jacuzzi now
Say Sosa life a movie now
I smoke bomba marijuana
When I come around it's a concert
And them commas coming like karma
I could fuck her and her momma
She said she like how my car ride
Okay she like how foreign cars ride
Bitch I'm a world star now
Sosa I'm so high I see stars now

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be kush smokin' car ride
She said she like how my car ride
I'm in foregin cars now
300 we some stars now
Buying out the bar now
Bitch I'm living large now
Got so high I see stars now
Bitch I'm in foreign cars now

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
The words go for 50 now
The verse go for 60 now
I gotta watch for the cops now
It done got hectic with the ops now
Big guns that'll knock em down
I gotta sleep next to a choppa now
I'm riding round in Rari's now
Ho textin me saying me excited wow

Big choppa that'll leave a nigga runnin'
Pull up, a ticket now

Goddamn I made my city proud
Chillin in the VIP smokin' kushy loud

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be kush smokin' car ride
She said she like how my car ride
I'm in foregin cars now
300 we some stars now
Buying out the bar now
Bitch I'm living large now
Got so high I see stars now
Bitch I'm in foreign cars now
