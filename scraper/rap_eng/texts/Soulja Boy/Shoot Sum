Making sure all of my niggas was shining
Finessing the plug he pull up with mo
We pour up the drug am covered in diamonds

Young nigga just pulled up to stunt on the island
I got two Lamborghinis with no mileage
Money make a nigga flyer than a pilot
Stay with that lean for the pain

Been whippin and flippin that thang
Nigga let that chopper bang
Shoot or no shooters a shame

Young nigga doing his thing

Imma let that Draco bang
