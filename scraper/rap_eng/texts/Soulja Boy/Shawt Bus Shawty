[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
OJ Da Juiceman and I got stanima
And I like animals, Hannah Montanima
Hit the club cuz, still eatin' a bananana
At the bar takin' shots dog, no camera
Ride the short bus and I'm boomin' and I'm bunkin'
Hit the classroom and you know I'm flunkin'
Tropicana Chevy orange sort of like a pumpkin
Sittin on the toilet 'cause still getting blumpkin
Boo me off the stage but I'm still gettin' money
As a cartoon man I'm still lookin' funny
Look like Winnie the Pooh, don't make me steal your honey
OJ Da Juiceman, keep it 100
Eatin' on some squirrel meat when I get hungry
When I get bored, dawg, I play with my monkey
Rap game hard, but the dope game crazy
Catch me in the kitchen dog whippin' up the babies

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci swag stupid, stupid, retarded
And I just farted, where's my Carmex?
Ugh, ugh, it's the Gucci Mane La Flare
And I'm 12 months pregnant and I still don't care
BURR! BURR! And you know I got a cold
Ugh, I can't breathe through my nose
My nose real stuffy and I'm ridin' on a Huffy
And my girl vaccum cleaner, wanna know, can she suck me?
Ugh, ugh, ride the short bus to class
I made a Z on my report card so I passed
Raise my hand in the class when we do math
Answer teacher question and all the kids laugh
I eat the red crayon 'cause the red one taste the best
And I cheat off Lil Darryl every time I take a test
BURR! BURR! Neck on wind chill
Move that thing on, atchin' King Of The Hill
