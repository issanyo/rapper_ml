Intro:
Yeaaaahhh, Matty Baby
Enjoy the show
Grab you popcorn, this show just started, bitch
We did!
Uh huh!
Yeep!
Ha, Matty!

Verse:
I know that I'll make it, I'm well educated
My rhymes graduated and made to get payments
Upcoming latest, soon to be greatest
I'm so underrated make rhymes witta cadence
My life would not trade it, I'm still steady trainin
My shoes are Versace, yours are like Payless
That's figurative statement, that I have just stated
Girls that I dated, are still masterbatin
To memories of me, cause they think I'll be famous
They hit up my phone, what a pain in the anus
When they are faded, saying Matty I'm waiting
Thinkin debatin, I want a relation
Don't be impatient, I'm losin my patience, check indications
Ain't got no time, dreams to be chasin
Those who hated, all have degraded, only bout greens like I am a racist
And all of the girls that would not lay with
Are cheerin me on, like Matty you'll make it
This ain't no fakin, I love your creations
Advanced and their basic, I've been long awaiting
You make so much songs, almost inflation
They say money talks, ya'll need a translation
Sweeping the nation, with dirty ville nation
You bars are so jaded, so throne I will take it
My boys will be stationed, ready to rake it
Straight murdering tracks, Freddy and Jason
Or maybe Sandusky, might have to rape it
The blazin Asian, first place I be racin
Grindin and Slavin on everyday basis
Then celebrate more than just on occasion


Outro:
It's ya boy Matty, signing' out
Me and my team comin'
We're gonna make it, wait on it!
Cyeaaahhh!
