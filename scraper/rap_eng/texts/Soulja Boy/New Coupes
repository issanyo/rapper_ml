[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Boy I trap hard, flex new coupes
Boy I'm big Soulja, who the fuck is you?
See my trap boys they be on the news
I be cashin' out on designer shoes
Droptop Benz boy new coupe
I'm big Soulja who the fuck is you?
And my trap boys they be on the news
I be cashin' out on designer shoes

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Boy I go hard ridin' new coupes
I am King Soulja who the fuck is you?
See my young niggas they be on the news
Saw me up in traffic he ain't know what to do
Had a 30 on me, long as a bitch
You ain't gotta ask boy I tote the clips
If you try me, put you in a ditch
I be makin' money like I'm Mitch
These niggas bitch made they really snitch
Ridin' thru the hood, 30 on my hip
Run up on me boy I got that FN
Run up on me boy and you won't talk again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I got 50 bricks in my fuckin' stash
Free my nigga Zell, free Kwony Cash
I take them chickens, make 'em take a bath
He say he wanna split it down to half
I need 80 plus and fuck the math
I cash out, I don't do the tab
2015 Tesla I do the dash
Ridin' thru the hood and you know I smash
TV screen lookin' like an iPad
Ridin' round town with like 9 grats
Run up on me wrong boy I'm a blast
And your baby momma, you know I smashed
Ridin' thru the hood smellin' like gas
Pourin' up lean, and I'm countin' cash
Got a bad bitch with a fat ass
Boy I trap hard, boy I count cash
Broad day pistols, tools they blast
Money on me, boy I got a bag
Boy I check a flag like I check a bag
SODMG, we runnin' it
Run up on me wrong I'm a spray ya flat
Choppa hit ya front, lay you on your back
Run up on ya house you get kidnapped
All I need is 9 but this Tec's mad
100k, that be in one day
I just hit a lick for like 60 ki's
They call me young Pablo E
Blowin' on dope, with no seeds
Run up on me wrong you get RIP'd
With my young shooters and they totin' heat
Big ass gun knock you off your feet
I'm a trap hard til I rest in peace
