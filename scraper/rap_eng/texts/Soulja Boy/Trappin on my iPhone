Woah, woah
Uh

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
My iPhone, trappin out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
Whole lotta money, stacking up on my iPhone
My iPhone, My (yeah)
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone

[Verse 1: Souja Boy]
If a nigga try to rob, I'ma leave him wet
I just got pints of the high-tec
Pourin' lean in my Styrofoam
You know I'm trappin' out my iPhone
Pull up, drop the top back
I'm getting money, every day black
Cuban link costs 50 racks
S.Beezy got 100 tacks
Shooters pull up with a 100 strapped
I got money, got a lotta racks
I'm King Soulja, I'm the C.E.O
Hoppin' out the Lamborghini, they like there he go

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out (trappin' out my)

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
In the trap house every thing mine
I be trappin bricks on my Facetime
I be sellin' bricks on my Instagram
Turn 200 dollars to 200,000 grand
Catch me in the trap, workin' with my man
We be gettin' money, you know that's the plan
Bad bitch, she say she my biggest fan
Soulja boy be leanin' like a kick stand
In-fared beam in my right hand
I be sellin' bricks all night man
Pull up in that brand new god-damn
50 on my chain look like

[Chorus: Souja Boy]
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out (my iPhone)
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone, trappin' out my iPhone
My iPhone
Trappin' out My iPhone
