[Verse 1: Arab]
Let me tell you about the life
And how live when you a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk
Everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a hand shake
Or want a high five
And these ugly girls always got a friend that wanna talk to you
Yahhh yahhh trick and your friend yahhh yahhh too

So get up out my face
You doo-doo head dummy
