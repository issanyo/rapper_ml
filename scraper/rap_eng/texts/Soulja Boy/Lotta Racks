[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Hey, Soulja
Hey
Hey
Yeah, you already know what it is, man
Young rich nigga shit
Young niggas taking over

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm getting the money, a lot of that
I count the money, a lot of racks
I'm getting the money, a lot of that
I count the money, a lot of racks
How about the Rari in matte black?
Money ain’t coming, will you [?]
Money ain’t coming, she [?]

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I get the guap and then I count it up
Walk in the club and then I turn it up
Nigga playing with Dre, we gon’ burn them up
A hundred bricks in the Bentley truck
Standing in the kitchen, hit the pot with the fork
Young rich nigga, grab a pint and pour a four
Young nigga came from the streets [?]
I jump out the rearview, got stars in the ceiling
Hit them with two-two just so he can feel it
That baby draco gon’ drill a nigga like a dentist
On a private jet, I’m on a mission
With the price of that, [?] activis
Take it, we rip it, then package it
Tell them my plug, he come back with a hundred of these [?]

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm getting the money, a lot of that
I count the money, a lot of racks
I'm getting the money, a lot of that
I count the money, a lot of racks
How about the Rari in matte black?
Money ain’t coming, will you [?]
Money ain’t coming, she [?]
Money ain’t coming, she [?]

I’ma go spend it and make it back

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Pulled up in that Rari, got a bad bitch with that body
Hoe freaky bitch get naughty, that pussy wet in that Rari
Getting back rubs and my chest rubbed in that Challenger 300
I’m counting all these racks up, ‘bout ninety stacks of hundreds
Been getting money, my niggas, from Dade County to Fruit Town
Picking bags up with my niggas, try to fuck her slow, but that bitch loud
Flying in on that helipad, y’all broke niggas, y’all hella sad
Fuck your bitch in my player pad

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm getting the money, a lot of that
