Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Soulja Boy tell 'em, swish!

[Verse 1]
I'm puttin' up points like an NBA player
In my city you can call me the mayor
I'm ballin' (I'm ballin')
You can catch me in the air
My jump shot got me shootin' 3 from way over there
We gettin' money over here, S.O.D. deliveral
Game in the chokel (chokel) just like Eddie Derrearal
I'm on another level (level) my click so thiral (thiral)
My butt so wellow (wellow) my ice so yellow (yellow)
Ok

Drop top rewireless (wireless)
Did you see the trums? (trums)
Pass me the winne (winne) and watch me slam dunk
Don't capare me to him (no)
I think he worth it
You can't ball hard as me in my sod jersey
Fans in the stand (stand)
Speakers goin' ham (ham)
Sprinkels shine as we I think I blew 300 grans
Catch me if you can (can)
I'm faster than the cheater

Shake the haters off (shake em)
Lanes get up on me
Soulja Boy ain't got no money, bitch, wake up and smell the coffee
I'm comin' thru your speakers (speakers)
Don't I sound good?
Shirt off showin' tats
In the club throwin' stacks (rats)
I'm ballin' so hard (hard)
I'm livin' so large (large)
Remote control chain and my diamonds autostart
Swag outerspace, I'm takin' off like a rocket
You ball harder, we ball the hardest

[Chorus]
I'm ballin', MVP baller of the year
I'm ballin', MVP baller of the year
I'm ballin' (I'm ballin') I'm ballin' (I'm ballin')
