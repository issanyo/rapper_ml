[Intro]
Welcome to my trap party
Call all the girls
We at the trap party
Welcome Wel- Welcome to my trap party
Trap party, trap party, trap party, trap party
Hustlin' trap party
Come to the trap party
Call all the girls
Tell 'em "come to the trap party"
Pull up to the trap party
Trap party

[Verse One]
Pull up to the party
[?]
Got money all on me
Diamonds, they dancin'
Pull up two Lam's
Pull up the Phantom
Trap [?]
[?] trap
All of this money
I'm swaggin' and cappin'
Giuseppe, that's nothing
My nigga, they stuntin'
[?]
Come from the slums
Throw a trap party
The bitches, they all up on us
Throwin' up hundreds, not ones
Nigga talkin', but we shootin' the guns
Nigga, we rollin' with [?]
Bitches, they rollin' with us

[Chorus]
Welcome to my trap party
This the trap party
Pull up to the trap party
Girls all on me
Trap party, trap party, trap party, trap party
Trap party, trap party, trap party, trap party
Welcome to the trap party
Girls all on me
Welcome to the trap party
All this money on me
I got kush, I got lean, I got everything
Welcome to the trap party
Tell her "bring the team"

[Verse Two]
Whip, whip, fire flame
Brand new hurricane
Girls all on me, mane
'Cause I rock a diamond chain
I walk up in a mall
You know that I'ma ball
Got Gucci on my drawers
My money sittin' tall
They say the Soulja paid
You know I keep the 'K
Run up on me wrong
And get shot, broad day
Shout out to the team
'Cause I know she's a freak
They say she's a freak
She flexin' every week
Soulja gettin' money
I count money in my sleep
Shout out to the squad
Every day, we rollin' deep
Just made fifty bands
Taxed 'em for a feature
Ridin' through the hood
And I'm in that new two-seater

[Chorus]
