[Hook]
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly

[Verse 1]
Fifty thousand on my ring, you know I'm soo clean
Pourin' up the Hi-Tech, I got all this lean
Make a hunnid thousand in my robin jeans
Ridin' through the city feelin' like a king
Bad bitch beside me and she soo right
Hop up in the shower and we fuckin' all night
I hop up in that Lamborghini, she like "oh my"
"Soulja, how you do that boy?, You soo fly"

[Hook]
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly

[Verse 2]
A hunnid ferragamo all belts boy, I stay clean
Clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean
She got the cake, hop out the Rari then hop out the Wraith
I'm out of space, I beat the case
Thirty one thousand in one minute, oh my god, I'm out of state
In a statues where I'm pushin' the door
Ridin' 'round, puttin' the game in a figure four
I'm in like Figaro the money comin' in and the money, it gotta go
Money is up in the trash bag
Flyin' on the carpet like I'm Aladdin
Money comin' in, you know I'm cashin'
Walk inside the bank, I need a million
Right now and I'm not playin'
Call my killas, they come through, you know they sprayin'
I got gold on my hair like super sayian
Money comin' in, do you dig what I'm sayin'?
And my backyard is a vacation
I'mma get that cake, there ain't no playin'
A million in your face, boy, why you hatin'?
I just have to have some patience, but I don't got no patience
I will never be the baby, I hop out the Rari, I'm spacin'
You look at the Lambo like oh my god, you're soo amazing
I'm whippin' the cougars, I'm killin' off Cubans
The money come in on my Rubens
I trap out the house, all the money from school

[Hook]
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly
