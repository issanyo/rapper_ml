Yo, Souljia, S-O-D
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating

And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt

And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
Headed to the paper
I’m a paper chaser
Yeah, got them hatin. Hating
And at 24 skatin, skating
Big ass pistol on my hip
True religion fist walking
Yeah, everything I rock before the...
I rock some new designer shirt

And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
A hundred K over my Louie belt

And I’m flying in my will
Headed to the cake
Walk us out the mall
I want everything I just told
Everybody know that I’m flawless
Shorty ass, shorty why you so cold
And I’m just sitting in my Bentley
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
24 I’m dating, dating
Ride by fast cars, skating, skating
Headed to a new check
Grinding my Benz up
Popping out the foreign whip
Soulja got crowns up
Everybody know we fresh together
Ridin in the city and I’m on the foreign whip

And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
Got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt
Flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
A hundred K over my Louie belt
Skating, skating
I love to suck dick
Hatin, hatin
I got them hatin, hatin
