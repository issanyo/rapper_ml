[Hook x2]
I run them bands up, nigga
I got FnN too, nigga
Pull up, Forgiato all black
Mad truck, i don't wonder we bust
Nigga, flooded my Rollie
We bust down
Sit in the shot like a touch down
Play with the gang
It's goin' down
I take the pound and I ship it out of town

[Verse]
There go Soulja, and he got that check on him
Ridin' round in foreign whip, and he got that TEC on him
Gucci on my backpack, a hunnid racks I stuffed in it
He playin' with the gang gang, he gon' get hit with hollow tip
Designer on my body, I got money but it's nothin', bitch
Gucci on my polo, color shirt on, nigga flexin' shit
Yeah, we got the game on lock
Yeah, jump in the Lamb, get the guap
Yeah, in the trap beat out the pot
Yeah, flood on my wrist is a lot
Yeah, can't let a nigga play with gang
Uh, VVS diamonds my chain
Yeah, 50 thousand for my ring
Yeah, I smoke a pound in the Wraith
Yeah, I'm in the trap catchin' place
Yeah, I whip it up in your face
Yeah, I win the Lamb like a race
Draco bullets eat your face
