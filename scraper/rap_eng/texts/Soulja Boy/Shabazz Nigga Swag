[Intro: Shabazz PBG]
Shabazz Nigga - 2 (Lil Bitch)
Rest In Peace Don, Rest In Peace Dre

[Verse One: Shabazz PBG]
I came up off the block I was selling grams
Bro stay with the boot and he work with the hammer
He in the kitchen he whipping it up Arm & Hammer
Pull up on my side I swear to god AR's won't jam up
I got a bad bitch in a Beetle
Pull up on a nigga block in a Regal
My bitch foreign; She look like she illegal
Met a migo plug he wanted a feature
Nigga's stealing swag just come buy a feature
We gon' pull up on your block Jeepers Creepers
Wear Christian Louboutin just like Adidas
Bro play with ice like he working at Ritas
Spanish mami; I call her mamacita
She wrap the bell up just like a tortilla
Go to Delaware just to swipe the Visa
I'm in Cumberland smoking Cali Reefer
Knock the pack out just like I'm Derek Jeter
I'm in the trap kicking shit like its FIFA
I'm in Atlanta looking for that teacher
I'm Shabazz Nigga, Lil bitch, nice to meet ya'

[Tae Dawg]
[Yeaaah, bitch I come here with them shooters]

[Verse 2: Shabazz]
My dogs came with glicks and them Rugers
We really shooting out Ubers
We keep sticks on us like Northeast Groovers
My lil bitch bad, she work at Hooters
I'm in a Jaguar with my Cougar
Turn your block into Elm street Freddy Krueger
I'm smoking OG; Don't do hookah
That lil bitch booted, and her head stupid
She from the Valley; I swear she Bougie
Hit that lil bitch, from the back; Got her oozing
Rapping lil niggas, actors need a movie
In Givenchy my bitch like me in Gucci
That, right there, you smoking, swag
Bitch I came here with the gas
Bitch I came here with the bag
So much, bitch, you gon' need you a mask
Niggas stealing swag so I need some cash
I might send Tae Dawg on your ass
I got my dogs in a cut with a mask
ARP .223, Extended Mags
Oooh, left him in a body bag
