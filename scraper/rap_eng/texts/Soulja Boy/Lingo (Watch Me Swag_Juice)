I'm so player, my bitch look like Draya
I'm ridin' round in LA, I'm about to see the Lakers
I'm smoking on papers, Bitch sike

Pull on the block, with hundred stacks
Fuckin yo bitch, and from the back
I got that money so nigga why swag
Swag swag oh lingo lingo
Pull up to the block Versace no Migo
My chain like a free throw

Jug jug jug jug, killin the pot
Whip whip whip whip, Versace my sock
Ride with a yacht, smokin a thot
Fuckin yo bitch, she just a thot
Fuckin yo bitch, I hope that you don't cock block

(Verse 2)
Drop out the top, then I go change the weather
I break it down, put it back together
Louis, Gucci and its all on my sweater
Aim a Tec, and I aim a Beretta
I'm gettin money, and ain't no money better
All of my niggas, we gettin' to the cheddar
All of my niggas, we gettin' to the cheddar
I'm fuckin yo bitch, and I'm getting her wetter
All that I got is this money
I'm whippin' and packing and stacking it
Its coming I'm racking
They talikin' 'bout the [?] gettin' money
Niggas, they ain't gettin' shit funny
Man that, watch that me juice
Watchin' me drop out the Tec out the coupe
Young Soulja Boy, yeah you know I'm the truth
Smokin' the kush, yeah I got the juice
Juice

(Chorus)
Watch me swag, watch me juice
Watch me swag, now watch me juice
Watch me swag, watch me juice
Watch me swag, now watch me juice
Lingo lingo lingo lingo lingo lingo lingo
