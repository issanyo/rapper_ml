[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Louis backpack
Custom snapback
Four gold chains
In the back of the Maybach
I'm on my retro steez
Four-finger ring
Gold everything
Gold in my chain
And you know my name
Pockets on C-notes
And I got it locked
All up in the East Coast
See me chillin' player
Riding through my city cashin'
Lil Dre that be the name
Blast Gang be blastin'
Everywhere we go
And you know we ball
When I hit the mall
Everybody out
I have to shut it down
Stupid shopping bags when I'm walking out
And I had L.V. everything so what you talking 'bout

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Stepped in the mall
Everything on me
Know it Bla' Gang
Stepped in the L.V. store
And the lady walked up
Offered me champagne
Shouts out to my whole campaign
Livin' life in the damn fast lane
Turned up when you see my chain
SOD [?] Ocean Gang Blast Gang
On flame
Already headed to the top
When you see me, know we gotta get it
Hustlin' every day got it, no specifics
Soulja Boy, man. I'm [?] like the Olympics
On fire when you see me on the TV screen
I'm gettin' cash with the digital dash
I flash by. Everybody see me
I'm like a satellite
I'm gettin' high
[?] concert of the night
And at the afterparty
Bottles of Bacardi, ros√©
Everybody on me
Standin' on the TV screen
And I'm lookin' like I'm in 3D
But I'm really in 4D
Everybody know me. Slowly
As I pour up in the four door
And the paparazzi taking photos
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
L.V. everything on the low
