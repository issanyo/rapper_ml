Say rich gang where we claimin', pullin' up on 20st thug

Money, they be fallin' out my pocket

Said I'm ballin', money, it be callin'
Ridin' in a foreign, look like Michael Jordan
All this money comin' like and it is well, a fortune
Money comin' in, I build a ton and I torch it
All this money comin' in, you know she like my style
Pull up to the club, you know I flex like this 1000
Money it be stackin', it ain't nothin' that I'm pillin'
