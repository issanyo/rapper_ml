[Verse 1: Zilla]

On a streak like the boy's in Miami
Crazy nigga, might rape your whole family
Zilla here, and he back talking gross too
Bout to get real nasty, tofu
Told you Cup Gang don't play round
Spray rounds and my niggas move like a Greyhound
Stay down please don't try your luck bitch
Got my hand up your girl skirt like a puppet
I play guitar on that pussy
I swear i ain't a killer but please don't push me
Cuz I'm still the Devil's advocate
Making rappers vanish like a fucking magic trick
You got me mad as shit, Z Eye in the zone
Never take a loss we the Heat playing at home
Never holding back it'd be best you didn't start me
Still a great white and its getting close to Shark Week
I like dark meat eating every rapper
This shit's funny please excuse my fucking laughter
Please excuse the chatter, my niggas smoking loud
Go against us and you'll get broken down
Team Solo Cup
We blowing up
Bitches throwing up
Ain't no holding us
I'll take ya bitch
Then take a shit
Cuz I'm good anything like bacon bits

[Bridge]
Nigga bacon bits, bacon bits
We good on anything like bacon bits
Baccon bits, bacon bits
We good on anything like bacon bits
Bacon bits, bacon bits
We good on anything like bacon bits
Bacon bits, bacon bits
We good on anything like bacon bits nigga
Like bacon bits
Like bacon bits
We good on anything like bacon bits

[Verse 2: Vaughn]

You know this shit sound good
Suburban motherfuker but I be up in the hood
Giving niggas dap, man I wish they would
I know they wish they could
Spit it like us
Retarded flow, no little bus
Lil' Reese said it best, "I don't trust niggas"
You don't mix blood with the figures
Imma blackout, Xanax and liquor
Take a GB get high quicker
No silver, all gold
XXL I need a centerfold
Many nights was cold I didn't have a jacket
Now I'm so fly I got maggots
I'm on my Kanye shit
Shouts to Asap, I'm so nigga rich
I mean check the steez
Bars so cold make the engineer sneeze
Puffin' California breeze
Bacon bits
This here for them Jamaican chicks
Maybe a rich bitch, get my dick licked
Smoking trip sticks
She devilish, three six
Vaughnsworld retweet this
Flawless flow you can't beat this
We kill rappers then bleach shit
Fuck it they can catch a nigga, but they can't lock my brain
Two words, fucking insane
Leave em' floating, David Blaine
We in a different lane
Another world
Start it up
Solo Cup
Real niggas, You know what's up
Fuck niggas, good luck
Bang bang

[Verse 3: Culayd]

Shit Imma little larger than I should be
But that's only cuz I'm out here eating these rookies
Get my cardio fucking bitches that overlooked me
All they wanna do is put Cul up in they nookie
Begging me to eat the pussy like this shit cookies
Lame niggas wanna talk shit
It ain't my fault you sleeping with a basic bitch
On some basic shit, nigga you ain't bacon bits
Your bitch wants this dick and she gon' take this shit
Lucky if I homie insult you one time
Fuck niggas round here like need a flat line
I fuck a fine dime I don't even wanna dine
Some wanna fuck me up for my rhymes or cause my chain shine
Nigga, you should ask yourself a question
After all these mixtapes why you ain't learn your lesson
You trying to stall us but all we doing is progressing
I hit Gandhi in the face fuck passive aggression
Lyrical assassin and my voice is a weapon
Part time surgeon and haters get dissected
Culayd the legend demanding to be respected
I feel like an adult, as a child I was neglected
This is my revenge I'm the industry step kid
Pissed off and wildin' out
Spittin' bars and acting out
Parents upstairs, I fuck my bitch on the couch
And nut on the pillow once I gotta pull out
Solo cup in my hand drinking until I pass out
Cup Gang, we the only thing you talking bout
Shut the fuck up boy and watch your mouth
