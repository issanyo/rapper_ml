[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
The way I move the bricks, you can call that shit the bird walk
Wrist going silly, ching ching ching is worth a milly
Gucci Mane La Flare, he's a down south Biggie or 2Pac
Like my bricks free wop
So Icey Boys, you can call us Wu-Tang
What's up, Frenchie, what's up, Wooh, what's up, Juiceman? Aye!
What's up, Kourtney Money? Walking on the industry
Through my whole body keefed, keep my mid by the piece
Try to rob Waka Flocka, you'll be dead on these streets, I'm a G
Ask your lady, catch me creeping in her sheets
Dick her down, did her good, next she suck my wood
Now my kids is in her mouth, dreads and gold, I'm from down south
Iced neck, iced wrist, iced this, iced that
Iced teeth, iced watch, So Icey E-N-T
So Icey, So Icey
Nigga, get just like me, nigga just get like me

Ice grill, ice chain, ice ring, iced out
If you cross S.O.D., we gonna knock your lights out
If you cross S.I.E., So Icey E-N-T
Waka'll beat the block up and the squad riding with me
Diamonds shining, goddamn, I'm on deck
I be shining, riding with ice on my neck
Okay, ya dig?
And now the Bow Wow we found, okay, ya dig?
It's going down like the countdown, I'm iced down
Waka Flocka, Flocka 'bout to shut the club down
Nigga, put your Glock down, I'm hot now
Yeah, Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I'm too, I'm too hot now
Crisp Monte Carlo, ordered Murci√©lago
Hollow, holla at your boy tomorrow
I let these hoes follow
Get them to the hotel, swallow
Yellow diamonds, call that shit "yallow"

Put DC on the map with that go-go music

With that go-go music
