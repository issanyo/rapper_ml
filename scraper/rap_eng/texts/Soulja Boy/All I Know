[Hook: Waka Flocka]
Buck down, buck down, buck down
You don't wanna get drug down, drug down, drug down
So motherfucker won't you calm down, calm down, calm down
Buck nigga lights so dumb now, dumb now, dumb now, Waka Flocka
All I know, All I know, All I Know

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Tell me why a nigga hit the club super deep
Screaming SODMG, Brick Squad 1017
Just like my little brother birthday, 1017
Smokin' hella fuckin' purp since 1017
Aw it's a new day, bitch, now we run the game
A.T.L. stand the fuck up, bitch I'm screamin' out Money Gang
All y'all motherfuckin' niggas is lame
I'll put that tech, put that shit to your neck
SOD Gang in this motherfuckin' club
All y'all lame niggas show motherfuckin' respect, SOULJA!
Lil B: Damn Soulja Boy, Waka Flocka y'all be swaggin'
Pull off in that Lambo and that car look like a dragon
Eighty for a show, pussy nigga mane what's happenin'?
My jeans cost thirty thousand dollars and they saggin'
Soulja Boy: Shout out to my nigga Gucci, we about to shoot a movie
Shout out to my nigga Holiday, we 'bout them fuckin' groupies
Word around town I am on deck
Soulja Boy Tell'em he cashed that check
With the stacks, and the racks, and the goons
And the brand new album comin' soon bitch
Sweep it like a broom bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Tiny jeans nigga and I comes with the choppah
Bitches on my dick cause I look like they father
Westside nigga, Donald Trump's be my father
Rich young nigga and I smokes like a rasta
Iced out ring, make that bitch wanna slobber
Cheese like that nachos, damn I need an Oscar
Bitches on my dick, they treat BasedGod like Odwalla
Fuck my main broad and I might just go an rob her
Pretty Boy Swag, your bitch like Cousin Skeeter
Young Based God came straight with the heater
Iced out bitch, home run like Derek Jeter
Your ho talkin' down, I'm Chris Brown so I beat her
Ask about my visa, bitch smoke this reefer
Young Based God cost forty for the feature
AK47 leave your ass like my reefer
West Berkley niggas, Waterfront through your speakers, rich nigga

[Hook]
