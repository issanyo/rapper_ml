"You're very beautiful", he whispered at the girl on the beach
"It's amazing how the days just slip away through the unfurling of the weeks"
She didn't speak, or even smile or reply
He repeated it again but the waves just swallowed all the words alive
Sandpipers chasing the torn paper edges of the waves
Another gust of wind paints her hair across her puzzled face
One of these days...he's going to escape and change the world
Come back to his hometown with a trophy and a girl
A girl like this with soft hands and a wise kiss
She'll teach him how to dance and dance her fingertips across her lips
But this...this is just another awkward pause
A pretty pair of eyes uncomfortable in front of all his flaws
He feels himself going bald in little bits and patches
Used to spell out love in them but now the letters come out all backwards
His pants never fit him right no more, forgotten how to cook
He used to take the room and run but now he's happy with a second look

"Pardon me miss, could you blow me a kiss?
Last night a couple of lovers tossed each other off that bridge
I think I better just call it all quits
I used to run this town but it just ain't the same place that it ever was."

He cut his finger just yesterday tracing a slender line in red
And watched it drain into the sink, the only thing that's left
A fingertip tipped down and drew another half a pint into
A perfect portrait of himself subtle beauty in still life
Everyone asked "Oh no! What happened to your hand?"
"Just another accident cutting vegetables I guess."
Everything's a trap these days we're all working to prevent
No one ever thinks of escape, just take the hit and bang out the dents
You don't know why he's standing here or how he got this far
Up the beach and out of reach of running rusted car
The waves are louder than a train crashing down upon his chest
He can't be dragged down like the rest and wait patient just for his death
Taking off his hat he steps and brushes her hair away
Kisses her cheek gently and asks her for her name
She bows her head and smiles a bit and takes a shaky hand
He has no idea just what she said with the waves crashing in his head

"Pardon me miss, could you blow me a kiss?
Last night a couple of lovers tossed each other off this bridge
I think I better just call it all quits
I used to run this town but it just ain't the same place that it ever was."

"Pardon me miss, could you blow me a kiss?
Last night a couple of lovers tossed each other off this bridge
I think I better just call it all quits
I used to run this town but it just ain't the same place that it ever was."
