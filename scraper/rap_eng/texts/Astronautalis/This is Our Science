Touch fire, just to taste the truth
Say "I'm gonna die." So are you
We chase the lightning, cause we need to move
This is our science, we've got nothing to prove

Tell me where you're going with that knife in your hand, yeah
Tell me what you're thinking, boy, what do you got planned?
See I don't trust your smile, I know your daddy lets you run wild as the wind
I saw you touch her eyelids and I can see you want so clearly to kiss her lips

I got friend who walks the strip with a gun on his hip
His reason is this: if people caught a glimpse they won't be talking shit
And he can rest his heavy fists, he got hands to take teeth
He don't need quarters to coax them from lips

To you, this is as crazy as it gets
To the man with the bruises on hands, it only makes sense, yeah
And that's the way that he is (tooth-taker)
And that's the way that I live

I wasn't born in a boxcar, when I die bury me with crossed arms
Underneath the tree up in the back yard
Slip that coin in my pocket, yeah, it's a lost art
Living what you're giving till it finally stops hearts

When us good guys die, we hope those that survive
Can spin a solid lie to make us look real hard
Cause we ain't tough, tell em Stef
(We just deal with whatever comes up)

This is for those who can't take a hint, find a hundred neighbors
Ask if they could change their life, then what would they do different
Would it be little shifts, or would it be some hidden dream
From the bitter deep that no one even knows exists

To me it makes sense
You can waste your time tossing blades of grass at the wind
Or you could swing fists, and if it sinks ships
Bury me at sea with my arms crossed and a smile upon my pink lips

Tell me this, put up your fingertips
If you're living your life exactly the way that you wished, yeah
And for the rest of us with our hands on our hips
Our work is never done, we are Sisyphus

Tell me where you're going with that knife in your hand, yeah
Tell me what you're thinking, boy, what do you got planned?
I don't trust your smile, I know your daddy lets you run wild, wild as the wind
I saw you touch her eyelids and I can see you want so clearly to kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss her lips

Touch fire (touch fire)
Just to taste the truth (just to taste the truth)
Say "I'm gonna die." (I'm gonna die)
So are you (so are you)

We chase the lightning (we chase the lightning)
Cause we need to move (cause we need to move)
This is our science (this is our science)
We've got nothing to prove (we've got nothing to prove)

So you touch fire (touch fire)
Just to taste the truth (just to taste the truth)
Say "I'm gonna die." (I'm gonna die)
So are you (so are you)

We chase the lightning (we chase the lightning)
Cause we need to move (cause we need to move)
This is our science (this is our science)
We've got nothing to prove (we've got nothing to prove)
