I've been blowing up your cellphone for days it seems
Now I'm knocking on your front door for a chance to speak
I don't worry you were dead but you can't believe
How many rumors 'bout yo ass flow back to me
People asking me, taking questions I don't have to [?]
If I wasn't so damn certain that it actually was happening
It had to be a tragedy, don't you turn your back on me
I have to speak, I bit my fucking tongue too long
And all the friends that sat silent have done you wrong
No man is an island, I can't cut you off
We've been through too much together to watch you fall, dawg
I can't pretend to understand your pain
We all had loss but what you been through is the same
We had the loss but the darkness in your brain
Is just how loneliness talks when you're left alone with pain
I ain't here to give advice, I ain't here to give no wisdom
You can't bring her back to life man, just here listen
Let her go, let her go, let her go you know
There's something you can never change
The world is spinning faster than you think, you can't keep pace
Let her go, let her go, let her go you know
There's something you cannot erase
Your heart is strong but it ain't strong enough to handle all this pain
I ain't here to give advice, I ain't here to give no wisdom
You cannot raise the dead my friend, but I can still save the living
Let her go, let her go, let her go you know
There's something you can never change
The world is spinning faster than you you can't keep pace
Let her go, let her go, let her go you know
There's something you cannot erase
Your heart is strong but it ain't strong enough to handle all this pain
Handle all this pain, handle all this pain
I'm here for you to carry the weight
Handle all this pain, handle all that weight
Shift away, might take it away
