I take that shot
I get passed out
I wake up in some living-rooms
I do not give any fucks

Stole a hundred, smoked 'til Sunday
Woke up with a wife and kids
I retired from marijuana, never gonna smoke again
I got a fifth of gin in me though, that's all that I really want
Any girls who wanna give me backrubs get inside the truck

I'm on top, and I'm saying this:
Dim the lights, fuck the lighting, babe
Diamonds on my side
I am young as fuck

It's a TV promise
We be Harvard on your fucking ass
