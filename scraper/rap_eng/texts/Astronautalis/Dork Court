[Verse 1: P.O.S]
All’s quiet on the interstate
Except for who you think?
Drivin, tryna innovate
Born to be wildlife
Born to be bored and get busy
Born to be styled right
Born to lose but do it pretty

Born a snake
Grew into some newer type manure
Sooner hit the sewer, fuck what alla yous are doing
Mostly roll with kooks
Heh
Mostly roll alone
Whippin through wherever
Too fast, ignore my phone more

Five thousand five hundred fifty six
Unread emails
Mary’s mad
I give a shit but kinda don’t
Heh
Good at business!
I’ll keep the sanity
Provided to me
Skipping prison

And hustle, hustle
And fuss over the illest shit
And dumb numb
Somehow I’m never ever feeling it
Listening intent
They see and say to pay the rent
My sentence is meant
Them toys could use a circuit bent

Circumvent
Circle talk
Roll a eye
Wiggle walk
Evasion nation
Pigs fly
Dogs talk
People love having human arguments with fucking bots
People love hanging out in puddles wearing baggy socks

Come the entire fuck on!
I’m head to toe in Karl Kani and Sean Jean
And Wu Wear and oatmeal’s on the rider
Gambling on Shark Tank
You lame mouth
For that reason I’m out
THANKS!

[Verse 2: Astronautalis]
All’s quiet on the western front
‘Cept me and my weird friend
On that rattle and hum
Live and direct, back in the saddle for once
Never tipped a cattle
But “Still Tippin” till cows’ll come home

Cowboy with the gold front grill
Paul Wall with the drawl
Paul Newman with the grin
Paul…Paul..Fuck!
Ran out of “Paul”s dawg
I guess I should pause now?
Fuck it, too far gone!

Ain’t no damn way to turn back now
So “Don’t Look Back in Anger” like I’m Liam or Neil
Yeah, I know it’s “Noel” and it’s spelled like “noel”
But his mama should’ve thought of that when she named the asshole!

Fuck you and the horse you rode in
I’ll burn your house down like Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes
Only on the Facebook to let you know when shows is
So you can let Russia tap all my phones, bitch!

Don’t at me bro!
Stay out of my mentions
Don’t talk to me or my sons again and
Don’t try to tell me J.Cole’s worth a listen
He just writes the same shit over
Like Bart in detention!

Calm down now!
Order in the dork court!
You sound dumb like white people sayin “norf norf”
Of course for sport I can bring more force
But your mom is on the porch
Saying you got more chores

So go fold your drawers
And don’t make no noise
Our you’ll have to move back in with your dad
Like they threatened in divorce court
