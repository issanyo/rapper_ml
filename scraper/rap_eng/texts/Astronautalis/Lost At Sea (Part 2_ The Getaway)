Everyone better get it together & get a better idea exactly how their favorite story should end
We've all woken from the same glorious dream, it's full of hope it ain't just wrinkled sheets & another empty bed
Are you so dumb to ask me why it never ends & why the hunter only loves the prey he never can get?
The only sucker dumb enough to get dipped into the Styx, he caught a cold, there's nothing certain with love & other train wrecks
She came in like a gun & made me run until my lungs were finally up & ready to call it quits
I love the chase, she loved the taste, the trap of being everyone's catch that almost always gave the slip
It's just a kiss & what's the worst to come of this? It's fun to think of what a bit of trouble can get
Come on in, the city thins & horns and things seem faraway from the 60 steps it takes to get from the doorstep to my bed

...and this is all I said
