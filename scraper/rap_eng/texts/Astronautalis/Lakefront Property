You left me standing on the edge of the lake
They all left for Rome, but I couldn't get a passport today
I guess a mistake they said it just slipped their mind
And I am standing here all alone grinding my time
Went to the man in the government office
Asked him how fast I could get a ticket of this
Silly ride we call my dying days inside of this place
He said "Your warrant's for arrest. We won't let you escape"
So I said "Okay, I guess I'll just wait"
Send me a postcard from the city of Rome
Tell me all the pretty things about the girls that you know
Buy me a bottle of wine and send it on air mail express
I'll drink it all alone inside my home by the lake in this mess
I'll send a, a thank you for not leaving in the night
At least saying goodbye and let me have my dignity right
I know I'm just a little sad bastard making a mess
Of this stupid little story that's dancin' in my head

But when I wake inside my bed and you're gone
I got nothin' better to do than stand outside
And wave to the geese flying over my front lawn
So I eat, sleep, drink and count the walls and tiles
And then I'll sit here and maybe try to crack a smile
But every day I sit and think of what you're doing right now
My friends and family skipped town - left me all alone in this crowd
And I know I'm just a sad excuse for... whatever - who cares
But bottom line is it's just a dream and I wake up right here
Next to you, next to your face and inside my bed
In my home in Jacksonville where no one's going anywhere
I still don't got a passport or a ticket of this ride
But fuckin' A, I'll stick around for the rest of my life

When I'm riding 'round the globe
And I'm doing this and I'm signin' that
And I'm trying
And I'm trying
