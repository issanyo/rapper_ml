And I'm bleedin' for all my real good sense
And all the sins that I've made
And I'm bleedin' for another good
Intention gone the wrong way
The wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way... hey

It's just a bit of nervousness
I didn't mean to turn a dress from the very perfect pinkly shade to murderous
And now her face is verdant green, Horrified, observe the scene, I made a mess
I spilled a glass of finest '83 indeed
Waitresses stop and stare, the patrons shockin' awful fierce
Forcing the forks and plates to clank in unison and rock their ears And look at me
Hope to scoop the country wolf who's under hoof
Whose blunder would be understood as social tragedy

"Never should've let him in
I never trusted him," I hear the people muttering
Through polished teeth and chuckling
The tensions quick and doubling
Glance at my date's ugly grin, she tried this case and cannot wait to erase this memory
Won't you see what must be done?
Waiter brings the sharpest one, now vengeance's coming
Finally the taste for blood is on her tongue
I reach to clean more wine that's fallen
Handkerchief in outstretched arm
Too late she takes the blade and tucks it deep inside of me

And I'm bleedin' in front of all your friends
I can pray you scrub the stains
And I'm bleedin' for all my real good sense
And all the sins that I've made
And I'm bleedin' in front of all your friends
I can pray you scrub the stains
And I'm bleedin' for another good
Intention gone the wrong way

Bus boys come equipped with cups
Jiggers, flutes and snifters thrust
Under wounds to catch the drops of blood before they hit the rug
And everyone politely claps, how quick my miss did swing the axe
Punishing the blundering, clumsy enemy
Just before I fade to death, the maître d' will take a step to
My date, waive the check, and offering to take her dress
Have it cleaned, return it quick
Apologies are furnished with
Happiness, she didn't wait to erase me from the scene
And everyone goes on with lunch
And never looking, talking of the tipping of the cup that stained my lady's pretty outfit
But the silence of the scene resumes as they drag me from the room
Erasing any trace of dirty dining history
Toasts are made and kisses blown
Conversations whisper on, and talk of saving whales, protecting all the kids at home
"I hear they're eating garbage cakes
I'll never stop till sad's erased from Webster's dictionary page
Think of all the cripples' days." As bills are paid, hands are shakin'
Art discussed by mantle place
Songs are sung to save some places
Signs are made to protest hate
Overwhelming damage rate – the nicotine and candle flame
And plans are laid by restaurateur to up security

And I'm bleedin' in front of all your friends
I can pray you scrub the stains
And I'm bleedin' for another good
Intention gone the wrong way
And I'm bleedin' in front of all your friends
I can pray you scrub the stains
And I'm bleedin' for all my real good sense
And all the sins that I've made
And I'm bleedin' in front of all your friends
I can pray you scrub the stains
And I'm bleedin' for another good
Intention gone the wrong way
