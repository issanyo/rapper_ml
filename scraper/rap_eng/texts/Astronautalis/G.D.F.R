[Intro]
[?]

[Verse: P.O.S]
God Damn Chan!
Laced us with this beat
So now I grace this lovely shit
With something taken from the reaches of my dreams
Blood and guts
Fucker what's and accusations
Pucker ups, sleeper nuts
And adult situations

And dropping steady foot by foot
Story after story
Passing time, no time to take a look
Dory prolly sorry
Nemo lost but really ain't too shook
Stef is prolly left behind
But chilling with a solid book

Like, like they ain't coming back
And I refuse to feel a feeling
Like they ain't looking out
But I got eyes on every villain
Know the best way out
Like every room’s a burning building
Show the worthless to the dumpster
Keep the true and willing

Filling up on junk (junk)
Passing up on sustenance
Busting under stress they pushing buttons
How they rest? I bet they don't
Like even if they earned it (if they earned it)
Turn too many other cheeks
You learn to watch em burn shit

[Chorus]
I don't even know us anymore
I don't know how we got this far
How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore

I don't even know us anymore
I don't know how we got this far
How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore

[Verse: Astronautalis]
I was lost in the weeds
Imbalanced chemically
Superchunk, indie punk
Tossing these seeds
Holding onto memories
Tracing these frail steps
Suicidal tendencies
Subliminally fucked with, yeah

Everybody love LA
Until you travel to the Bay
Everybody want to stray
Until you realize she bae

Lock it down! Block em out!
Put a ring up on it (quick)
In the club with you singing
“Throw some D's up on that bitch!”
Empty floor! Let em talk!
We ain't worried bout that shit
Whole city is our club
And we run that fucking thing! (hahaha)

Broke in the construction site
Years before we'd ever fight
Making out in the street lights
Now this is fucking our life!

God damned fucking right!
God damned fucking right!
Now this is fucking our life!
God damned fucking right!

[Chorus]
I don't even know us anymore
I don't know how we got this far
How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore

I don't even know us anymore
I don't know how we got this far
How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore
