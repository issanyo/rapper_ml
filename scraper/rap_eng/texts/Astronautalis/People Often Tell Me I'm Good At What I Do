I like living, it's easy
Moves like a gift in a weather that's breezy
Blew by my lips
Shakes like the uneasy when seduced by a kiss
I wanna slide my hand underneath your pillow where it fits

Walk to the ocean and wait for your orders
Sit up all night, watch the blue lights flick on the water
It's all right if you never show
Just the idea that you might's enough to keep my head afloat

I guess its all to common for people my height
Walk around, head in the clouds, ducking under streetlights
Hate the phone, the fax, the emails and the rest
Handwritten messages always seem to say it best

But once the pencil hits the paper and the pigs in the poke
Addressed in Sunday's best with a stamp on the front
Teady to drop inside the box and take flight with the storks
I can't seem to placate dreams and commit to the cause

I got a box of old letters, a brain filled with buzzards
Ready to swoop down and pick apart my pain from my druthers
It's inane and it hovers, at the back of your thoughts
Like poppin' pills dry inside the throat that get caught

I guess I was just scared it'd come out wrong
So instead of sending those letters I wrote you this terrible song
I guess, I'm still really scared
And that's the way it goes with being unprepared

I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through
I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through

I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through
I wanna write good songs that
I wanna write good songs that
I wanna write good songs that
I wanna write good songs

I know I should have called you I know its six to seven digits
Misdirected by reflections and flickering televisions
Sometimes I like to steal odds and ends from peoples houses
New q-tips night-standing, digging pennies out of couches

I got a set of sticky fingers and a back built for hammocks
But this ain't no doctor's note and I ain't no blank canvas
It's just the way the pen is, I'm good at what I do
From failing to falling in and out of touch with you

I wanna shake hands with the world and make mix tapes for America
And find the time to tell you the things I normally find embarrassing
You've always been fantastic, I've been foolish and sub-par
I hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar

Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar
Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar
Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar
Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar

I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through
I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through

I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to
When the lights go up and the night's all through
I wanna write good songs
I wanna write good songs (good songs)
I wanna write good songs
I wanna write good songs
Good songs
Good songs
Good songs
