Out here in the night under sodium lights
In a city that's still holding your name
We danced in the fall to all your old songs
Re-living all of your mistakes
In a parking lot there
There's a couple unaware
Of the cassette that the tape deck just ate
And you most of all know how fast we can fall
When we can't bear history's blame
Cause we never change

It's just for every bit of circumstance
I never should have let it get inside my head
But now I have [?]
You gotta try to understand
Take a trip inside my shoes
Now hold my hand
Hold my hand
Hold my hand
Hold my hand

[?]

These are the best days of your life
They tell you every time
They're dragging you out into the street
These are the best days of your life
They tell you every night
No idea how good you've been to me

The tape that's been forced fed to dash
Is running itself to an early grave
Slowly [?] is just giving in
As it plays itself it collapses on its face
Some walk inside the woods
Brave men hunt for their canned goods
Sitting by the stream [?]
They scream and sing their sad songs to me

These are the best days of your life
They tell you every time
They're dragging you out into the street
These are the best days of your life
They tell you every night
No idea how good you've been to me

Out here in the night under sodium lights
In a city that's still holding your name
We danced in the fall to all your old songs
Re-living all of your mistakes
In a parking lot there
There's a couple unaware
Of the cassette that the tape deck just ate
And you most of all know how fast we can fall
When we can't bear history's blame
Cause we never change

These are the best days of your life
They tell you every time
They're dragging you out into the street
These are the best days of your life
They tell you every night
No idea how good you've been to me
