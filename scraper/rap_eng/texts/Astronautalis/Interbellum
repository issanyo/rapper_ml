[Hook]
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real
The real
Real [?] man is never broken man
The, the, the real

The, the, the real

Real [?] man is never broken man

[Verse 1]
It’s that amazing thing
When a pigeon takes to wing
Though impossible it seems
It keeps its pace just hovering
Feathers flapping in the rain
So perfect as the finite dream
It hangs outside a window
With a northbound speeding train
This stairs
I’ve seen them doing things
From coop to stoop to window pane
Cool and quiet on the train
Defining monuments to greats
Then one day, the one small day
In the sin mixer of lowly change
But change to clanks to [?]
The gently moving wing
Holy in name
By the bird
Frozen in amber
Levitating, so very patient
Within the fingertips’ reach
Hypnotize eyes never looking back
As I wave goodbye on the street
So you can be free
Be free

[Hook]
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real
The real
Real [?] man is never broken man
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real
The real
Real [?] man is never broken man

[Verse 2]
Once you pawn your diamond rings and things
Forsake friends and family
Erase every entry in your diary you had for me
Melt down your crown and give the things
Pay full for every field and stream
Then one day just up and leave
So you can be free
If you sell your soul so happily
I’d gladly pay you handsomely
But I know that fuckin’ devil
Keeps his pockets just so goddamn deep
Every time I try to reach into my wallet
For another buck
I only come up with a key to open your cage
And set you free, so be free

[Hook]
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real

Real [?]
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real
The real
The, the, the real

Real [?] man is never broken man
The, the, the real

The real
Real [?] man is never broken man
