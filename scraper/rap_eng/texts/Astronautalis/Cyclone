I will always tell you exactly what the fuck it is
When [censored] dies he's going to be born into a pile in Japan
A little Japanese guy always on a plane
For years and years and years
And we'll be with his friends
And we'll drink expensive whiskey
And we'll trade records
And periodically get very drunk at a karaoke bar
And we'll sing shit and every song we sing will be pitch perfect
But the bass will sound even better when we sing through shit
And they won't even be running the bass through [censored]
It'll just sound better that way
And when anybody sings through [censored]
They get laid that night
That's the facts, that's how [censored] is reborn
Amen, Jesus Christ, Buddha, Allah, Tom Cruise
Touch down, Spring Break, homerun, game over


I wanna stay in the rain
I wanna change other things
But God damn it, Leslie
What the level lesson
With the credit to your crew
But while it's my crew you're giving credit to
Stand against you
Show you love, show you happiness too
I want no more war

'Cause I'm a cyclone
And I'm coming to tear down your house
Don't leave your lights on
Cause I'm just gonna blow them out
