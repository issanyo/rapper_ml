Three hundred butterflies
They wrapped them in her ribs
And now she cuts across the interstate
The world will choke on traffic

Three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs
Me and the cannonball's looking at the moon
And now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic
Who’s peeking over the edge like no-good-kids with water balloons
(the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms)
I want to swallow the wind, let it hollow me thin
Three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs
(and worthless to be sold, filled with cataracts and scratches)
And call a friend who’s laughing like, laughing like a criminal
And now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic
(the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms)
She watches fireworks launching and sparkling, spinning
Three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs
(and worthless to be sold, filled with cataracts and scratches)
And twenty kids live like giants making yearbook material
And now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic

Step by step by misstep
Nothing more heartbreaking than
Oops, I found myself in someone else’s shoes
A car that’s been stationed since…
And step by step by misstep
Well, long enough, and long enough
Oops, I found myself in someone else's shoes
To let the grass grow up around its feet

Step by step by misstep
Nothing more heartbreaking than
Oops, I found myself in someone else’s shoes
A car that’s been stationed since…
And step by step by misstep
Well, long enough, and long enough
Oops, I found myself in someone else's shoes
To let the grass grow up around its feet

Later I’ll kiss the smile off your face
And toss this shape into the Rio Grande
I could follow it along the riverbank
To reach the beach
And we could roll around in the sand

I want to break the bank, and crush the glasses
Chase the tape, combat molasses
Face-to-face I punch the mattress
Awake, escape, and trace the atlas
They case the place and ban the back flips
Leave the flashes to the books of matches

Today’s the day
Today’s the day
They catch us
Today’s the day
Today’s the day
We turn it backwards
Today is the day
Amazing things happen

Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes
Nothing more heartbreaking than
Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry
A car that’s been stationed since…
As the light from the television flickers on the table
Well, long enough, and long enough
And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes
To let the grass grow up around its feet

Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes
Nothing more heartbreaking than
Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry
A car that’s been stationed since…
As the light from the television flickers on the table
Well, long enough, and long enough
And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes
To let the grass grow up around its feet

Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes
Nothing more heartbreaking than
(we're looking in)
Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry
A car that’s been stationed since…
As the light from the television flickers on the table
Well, long enough, and long enough
(on a better life)
And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes
To let the grass grow up around its feet

Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes
Nothing more heartbreaking than
(with our faces)
Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry
A car that’s been stationed since…
As the light from the television flickers on the table
(pressed against the glass)
Well, long enough, and long enough
And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes
To let the grass grow up around its feet
(and now you've turned away)

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Teeth bared, broken noses
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
Twisted fingers, swollen toes
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
And I could do with another drink
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
I could do with another
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Teeth bared, broken noses
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
Twisted fingers, swollen toes
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
And I could do with another drink
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
I could do with another
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Nothing more heartbreaking than
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
A car that’s been stationed since…
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
Well, long enough, and long enough
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
To let the grass grow up around its feet
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Nothing more heartbreaking than
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
A car that’s been stationed since…
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
Well, long enough, and long enough
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
To let the grass grow up around its feet
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Nothing more heartbreaking than
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
A car that’s been stationed since…
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
Well, long enough, and long enough
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
To let the grass grow up around its feet
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

Nothing more heartbreaking than
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
A car that’s been stationed since…
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
Well, long enough, and long enough
I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights
To let the grass grow up around its feet
I want to run so fast it gets left behind

I want to jump a million miles
Look back at the lights
I want to run so fast it gets left behind
