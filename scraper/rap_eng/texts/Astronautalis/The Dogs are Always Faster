It's so funny it makes me sick I guess the way your brain'll think
"Shit if I weren't being chased this'd be a nice place for a picnic"
The tree farm planted in neats and rows, the leaves and branches smack my face
I'm trying to escape I hear the braying hounds chase
They're giving me a run for my money as I am moving as fast as I can
And every once in a while it feels like I'm moving in slow motion again
But the rest of the world is moving at twice the speed I'm trying to make sense
And as the dogs are barkin' there's always guns to follow after me I guess
I hear their whistles and their calls braying the dogs right on
As the dogs are leading white people following with their guns under their arms

And I run as fast as I can through these woods, i'm breathing now
I feel my lungs explode as I move in fast forward - escape the crowd
It's my chance to get up out this mess - move as fast as I can
I wanna feel my lungs pump like pistons out of an engine, man
My head will explode as the veins pump inside my face
As I hear the dogs catch up to me as the slow motion takes place
And they are moving double quick and I'm trying to move fast
[???] maybe I could climb a tree and watch them all pass
I reach for the branches of the thickest tree right in my eye sight
The branches all seem slippery - like they've been covered in grease all night
As I try to climb and pull myself up and nothing happens
It's just more wasted time as they're gaining ground on me, captain
And I know this is my chance, I've got to run right now
So fuck a tree just run until my heart breaks down

So I'm pushing through the woods, double time and quicker speed
No dog can catch me as they move silent in slow motion see
And I am moving twice as fast [??? bitch/pitch?]
As I am trying to escape for a crime I know I didn't commit
And it makes no sense but I am just gonna keep pushing on
I feel my finger, legs and brains and arms slowly going numb
And there's nothing gonna stand inside of my way as I try to escape
No motherfucker will catch me, no, not today

And then it hits me like a pile of bricks - I'm standing right now
Trying to move fast and all of a sudden slow motion breaking down
And it feels like my arms are made in ten pound leather suit/soup
And I'm swimming under water as they're moving as fast as cars, dude
And I see 'em getting close - I feel their hot breath on my neck
And I reach around to try and strike 'em down to escape
And all of a sudden a bite takes inside my arm again
I feel the dogs teeth sink inside my tiny white skin
And I know it's all over and turn as I feel the warmth of the blood
Run down my skin and slowly check my form
And I look up at the sky and I see the stars flicker through
Inside the break, inside the pass, inside the tree farm dude
And I know I can die right here and be all content
Because I gave it all, I gave my damnedest and I'm gonna straight pay for it
If I go to heaven or hell or purgatory it doesn't matter to me
As their teeth sink inside my skin - rip me limb from limb see
I like the pain I like the death - give it to me now
I start laughing and screaming out as they tear me apart child
And there's nothing I can do so lets just bask in the glow
Of the pain and impending doom and the death they already know
And it's coming my way, bring it to me closer
A white light burns over my eyes and I know it's getting close
As my body starts to go cold and my brain doesn't make any sense and I'm losing all control
I start to twitch and shit and all of a sudden I get a bur in my ass
I ain't going out like this - I ain't dying, cat
And so I stand - walking dead, missing limbs and dripping blood
Fuck all you bastards, I am escaping and taking control
So I start running again - the dogs are equally surprised
I see the men standing there scratching all their arms and eyes
It's like I've never seen anything happen, this is the walking dead escape
I am so determined I promise I'll be up on my way
They never give chase the terror's what sets them
Leaves them standing like cement wet feet, dragging 'em down to the bottom of the water
Understand that I am leaving - not gonna go under their guns, under their ways
And I'm taking control of the show so I go
I go, I run, as fast as I can
And just when they're outta sight
I collapse
And die

And then I woke up
