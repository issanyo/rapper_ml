Oh you, careless eyes
Oh you, happy bones
I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope
I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope

Oh you, milk soft hands
Oh, you, neatly combed
I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope
I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope

I am the one you sought
I ain't around the block
I've got the steady hands and a mean game of small talk

I put my quarters up and waited for left and lesson learned
I guess I got some questions had to just walk away
This is it, my last game
There's more than winning and losing
It's too late to save face
Ain't no man with strength in his hands
I'm just like you another pawn in play

Dreams where I can talk the talk and the ball is placed
I love the stain felt the small chinks I love the way the chalk tastes
I lean upon my hands stop them just before it falls away
Charge forward to future and watch the white ball race

A few were set askew for one and two with six and five
I couldn't believe my eyes the cue ball laid away split away into equal sides
The end is nigh I can feel a storm coming, its the first sign
Next generation of first born running the end is nigh

I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign
Next generation of first borns running, the end is nigh
I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign
Next generations of first born running, the end is nigh
I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign
Next generations of first born running, the end is nigh

There's a midnight voice and I can hear its scream
She can't live my dreams if the sky falls asleep
It's all in my thought and deeds

My apologies lack protection collapsed in her affection, "naw," he cried
Begging for her strength, strength my dusty tears bloody
Loving before this becoming, wondering if I could have ever saved myself
I felt my heart sink, I think you fell head over heels only to be let down

The stars don't seem so high and the world won't turn around
She says I'm so indifferent and I killed us both somehow
I reply that a dying man doesn't change, but I can't continue to exist
We won't see the light of day because tomorrow isn't promised

Oh you, careless eyes
Oh you, happy bones
Oh you, milk soft hands
Oh, you, neatly combed

I'm never right
I'm never right
I'm never right
I'm never right, I hope
I'm never right, I hope
