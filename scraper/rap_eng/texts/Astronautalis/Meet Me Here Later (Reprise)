Baptized in soft skin with bitten lips
I passed by her lost in the sketchy land
Lines of breadcrumbs retrace for the ride
Bathed in the blue light of perfect American nights
American nights

Funny right lovely night song sets pace
Young lovers sing along through touch face
True love waits in shallow waters under darkened skies
Little handcuffs and the solid plans and blacked out eyes

We're killing cowboys left and right again
With guilty little trips, recycled cans
That give me whiskey lips and dirty hands
And everybody's got a ribbon all of a sudden and its a box newsstand
Alright!

Starry eyes, shitfaced lions, planes
Let's call the supermodels and all of the fucking vagrant bands
And ask them just exactly what they've got planned
To save us from our own impending doom

They were baptized with soft skin and bitten smiles, bitten smiles all lost in
Oh god how you glow, oh god how you glow

Meet me here later and we'll make out

They were broke bones, paint chips with bitten smiles, bitten smiles and soft hits
Oh lord how you shine, oh lord how you shine

Meet me here later and we'll make out

"You ready?"
"Yeah I'm ready."
"OK, let's go."

"1... 2... 3..."

Last one rolls from the mall right down Third Street
Doing donuts through front lawns, keg in the backseat
Pancake pants, pick up, make out, and bleed

Mr. Mouth with the largest pockets packed with popcorn
Seems to cost me nothing
Costs me nothing
Costs me nothing
Costs me

Assholes all obsessed with spelling
Sweaty, out of breath from yelling
Chase him up and down the ceiling
Fuck you bleeding heart

Take another 20, buddy
All we need is burning money
Check, swore I'd laugh at anything

They were baptized with soft skin bitten smiles, bitten smiles all lost in
Oh god how you glow, Oh god how you glow

Meet me here later and we'll make out

They were broke bones, paint chips with bitten smiles, bitten smiles and soft hits
Oh lord how you shine, oh lord how you shine

Meet me here later and we'll make out

They were baptized, soft skin with bitten smiles, bitten smiles all lost in
Oh god how you glow, oh god how you glow

Meet me here later and we'll make out
