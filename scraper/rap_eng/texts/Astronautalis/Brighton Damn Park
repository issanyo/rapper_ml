Tell me again about the night you lost it all
About the whipping wind [???]
Tell me again about the night it fell apart
[Down?] in Brighton Park

Tell me again and take me firmly by the arm
Grip me tight and guide me through the leaves and falling [???]
Tell me again about the night you lost it all
Down in Brighton Park

See ivy winding slyly up the blackened brick of Brighton
Damn, it's silently reminding me how tight I grip your tiny hand
It's funny finally now that I can loosen hold and understand
How quick you slip right back into the comfort of older circumstance

Itâ€™s those sneaky little holes that spread to show your skin
Through broken pants
Familiar fingertips that tap the time to history's hopeless dance
And everyone's enamoured by the drunken drifters funny tape
But no one knows the wash of the wake when the levy breaks

And I can't find my way home
Find my way home without you

She told me everyone's a critic getting caught up in their feelings
Newscasters snapping under all the lights and [?]
Cameras click and film an up and empty desk and hollow breathing
As news becomes the news, tune in at ten p.m. this evening

She's such a funny way of getting across the way that she's been thinking
Lost her brain's a Basquiat I wanna solve so lets just sit and talk
"I'm sorry, darling" she says "You know I'll never play that part"
She kisses me goodbye and leaves me by the reservoir
And I would never see it then as anything but being scorned
As the pine needles drop in perfect patterns on the forest floor
But trudging home in Autumn glum, the crunching leaves they sing a song
You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far

Knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far
You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far
You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far
You know who you are

And I can't find my way home
Find my way home without you
