{Intro Melody}

[Hook]
A sliver of chalk
Across the blue
Lord knows I don't know what
The hells the use of the Midday Moon

You came to my arms
Too god damn soon
Lord knows I don't know what to do with you
And the Midday Moon

[Verse 1]
This is just to say
They've taken everything away
Every step we made, fit into 6 trucks, pick ups, drawing dust above the driveway
The muddy cavalcade came at half-past eight collecting everything in that grassy bank
And every trace of you, was taken too, and what was once a room is just a hollow room

It was a windy day
That kind of makes me hate L.A
Cause God gave them a perfect sun and they think gangs and smog were hardly a fair trade
And they don't breathe or flinch, or even blink at how the green will shift
When the wind parades across the meager ridge and kicks the leaves a bit to make seem as if the lea is a sea of waves

They say you can't cheat death
Maybe it's just the shortness of breath
No pains in your chest
A disease we agree we ain't cured yet

Forgive me dear
Never thought we'd end up here
From "Sweet Dreams" whispered in your ear
Before a long night's sleep so cold and clear

[HOOK]

A sliver of chalk
Across the blue
Lord knows I don't know what
The hells the use of the Midday Moon

You came to my arms
Too god damn soon
Lord knows I don't know what to do with you
And the Midday Moon

[Verse 2]

I've been told when we die
And we pass to the other side
There is no bright light
There is no bright light

Death is just a pasture gate
That opens by lifting a plank
To just more life
Just more life

I met an old man, sun tan, provided by Jesus and the light that passes through stain glass pieces
He clutched a rosary flat to his chest, and confessed he wasn't ready for death

I seen an iron-eyed firefly femme fatale too vain to explain how her hair fell out
Lusting for the next thing to erase her shame
She said "I don't want to live forever, but I'm scared to fade away"

And this is all how the came to me, one at a time
Pilgrims to my building on the cemetery ground
And all they wanted was an answer and I could never let 'em down
I couldn't promise them forever but I could buy a lot of time

And you Jeanvieve, well you were the straw
Whispering your wishes in cotton Québéois
I wonder if the maker ever felt he botched the flock, but never had the mettle to make the World stop

I wonder if the maker ever felt he botched the flock, but never had the mettle to make the World stop?

I wonder if the maker ever felt he botched the flock, but never had the mettle to make the World stop?

[HOOK X2]

A sliver of chalk
Across the blue
Lord knows I don't know what
The hells the use of the Midday Moon

You came to my arms
Too god damn soon
Lord knows I don't know what to do with you
And the Midday Moon
