[Intro x2: Ceschi (Astronautalis)]
Poor big baby
You poor sad fucking baby
Poor poor poor poor
(cry me a river)

Clichés are changing
Now there's nothing kitsch about you
You're just a leather face with a hard cock
Blowing lines in a punk club bathroom
Dreaming of 1966 bitches
The way they flocked to your dick and riches
Like a pack of dogs in a fried chicken kitchen
Now they're moms and leaders
Gone with the wind
And you're just gonorrhea
A fraud and a peon
That never went beyond
Your own ego
When the g's turn to c-notes
You can just sit and wait for the lesser of 6 million evils

[Hook x2: Ceschi]
This is not New York
This is not a sold out crowd
I am not a water boy
I am not your conscience

[Ceschi]
Good Grizzly God
Tell me this is not what I'll become
Because i can barely stand the backstage stench of cum
That's dried on tagged couches
And if I see another cock and balls drawn on this green room wall then i might quit
We slept in cold sweat across the Midwest
Playing metal shows for drunken whores in clown suits who couldn't care less
Lost girlfriends and jobs
All for the love of a song
All for the 15 minute moment of glory that's now gone
Paid with fried cheese and bad beer, and I don't drink beer
We grew beards in those European vans
Where fruit flies fluttered on farm fresh pears
And dead deer diaries began (peace to 2mex)
So wrap yourself in the skin of frozen bison
To protect that pretty face from the ice wind
We try to win but we're just humans with vices and sins
And time is spread thin
Like birthday cake icing
I tried to tell you backstage
But the women got in the way
And the drugs had already hit your brain
I wanted to tell you backstage
[cough cough]
I tried to tell you backstage
But the women got in the way
And the drugs had already hit your brain
When they reminisce over you
And speak as if your life is through
It just might be true
(Pete Rock and CL Smooth)

[Hook]

[Outro Astronautalis:]
I tried to tell you in the van but I couldn't focus on anything cause you were shaking hands
Tried to tell backstage
Tried to tell you in the van
I tried to tell you in the hotel room but it’s tough to talk when everybody's around
Couldn't remember the words to those songs and everything that I was thinking would just come out wrong
