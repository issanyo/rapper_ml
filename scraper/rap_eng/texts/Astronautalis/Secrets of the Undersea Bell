[Chorus]
Every old salt knows a song to sing
When things go wrong, and things go wrong
They can resurrect men with mighty hymns
Cannot raise the diving bell
Every old salt knows a song to sing
When winds are gone, and winds are gone
Fill flat sails with the softest strings
Cannot raise the diving bell

[Verse]
With their hands cut open and the line unweaving
Sea swells like the ribcage of lions breathing
They pulled 'til you swore that the rope was bleeding
Ichor poured from the palms of gods and heathens
When their bell dipped down in the Stygian deep
And they know many omens are spoken evil
But those poor souls that know that awful feeling
They're dancing like their lantern candles

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well the sanguine sun set on the evening
In the sea like glass that was far too peaceful
Though the line ran tight to the bell beneath it
In heaven is where the devil always hides his secrets
Let me teach you songs that will fare you well
Let me draw you maps through the gates of Hell
Who would kill those men no one can tell
The secrets of the diving bell (x3)

[Chorus]
