You say the world's in shambles and the kids have lost their minds
You can have your heroes
Your heroes ain't mine

They swear I'm just an idealist and my faith is blind
They can have their heroes
Their heroes ain't mine

My old man ain't got no medals, he ain't never saved no one's life
But he worked his finger's raw to provide for his lovely wife

So, you say the world's in shambles and the kids have lost their mind
You can have your heroes
Your heroes ain't' mine
