Friday was payday look how I spend it all
About to put the streets to sleep Ya'll Demerol
Hit the mall, kick game exquisite
I don't live in this realm I just visit
Push up to Monday, dough on Chemo
Peanut Butter crackers got me feeling all emo
Effin depressing, I could be investing
In something better yet I'm trying to buy a jet ski
Impressing no one but the sales clerk, real jerk
Paying with cash and a "Muthafucka Yeah" smirk
Hoping the hoes love it, juggling a blown budget
Plotting on a 4 finger ring with gold nuggets
Nothing in my savings my cravings crush
People thinking that I'm balling I ain't balling enough
Trying to separate myself from other kids in the hall
Truthfully like Ted Williams I ain't flossing at all

[Astronautalis Hook]
It's the freshest facade, I try so hard
Look how reckless I ball, til I hit that wall
The Jokers my card, the kingdom is flawed
The curtain may fall, I'm not worried at all
It's the freshest facade

[Travii]
Does Travii Really ball
I know it looks that way to y’all
Its Really just illusions
It’s not like that at all
See my pockets full of lint
And I’m writing my own script
As I’m moving along
Like the words of this song
I’ve learned to get in where i fit
But I’m uncomfortable as shit
Escaping thru the bottle every time it touches my lips
Numb to the cause of living check to check
As soon as i get it
Casino placing bets
Hope that i win if i didn’t I’m all in
There’s no turning back now let the dice fall were they may
If there’s one thing i could say
It'd be thank you to you all
Cause you got us around the world rocking shows and all
From Texas to UK
Germany to New York
Sleeping on your couches eating food for sport
Mad respect goes to the ones that give it
The rest they get facades
Its the world and how we live it
Live it.....

[Astronautalis Hook]
It's the freshest facade, I try so hard
Look how reckless I ball, til I hit that wall
The Jokers my card, the kingdom is flawed
The curtain may fall, I'm not worried at all
It's the freshest facade

[Keynote]
I Got that Benz out side but the A.C's broke
Got a smile on my face but this ain't no joke
Got a lot on my resume but ain’t living my dream
Watching others in the game but, I got the winning team
Goin’ hard traveling the globe gaining up steam
Every win there's a loss, back to swimming up stream
My analysis of life can be a little extreme
Others think I'm living large but things ain't what they seem
Got Lamborghini dreams and a bus pass budget
But put Bodega in the system and all the people love it
And even if they don't, Im'a front like they do!
And rock this motherfucker out till I'm dead cold and blue
The facade of a winner but I’m takin’ more losses
Everyone claiming bosses but, I'm askin’ what the cost is
Seems a little much, and what you see is a shell
Don't get it by now? I’m done with this, Oh welllllllll

It's the freshest facade, I try so hard
