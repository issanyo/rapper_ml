Let's take the long way home
Break each other's bones
What your daddy don't know
Won't put no pox on his soul
You know
You haul a heavy load
Draped in your mama's gold
Think of how good you'd look if you were a ghost

Shorty swing my way
Lock the fucking deadbolt draw the shades
Got fired on a Friday
Back on the block the same damn day
I know we got problems
I used to be real good at making 'em fade
But we run out of options
Fuck I look like bagging groceries at the pick n save
If this a different age
And you and I had different names
We probably wouldn't sweat a single thing
But hey
I know you hate this game
You probably plot your great escape
To run back to your mama and your daddy
But dang
It ain't so simple babe
You handcuffed to my wrist again
You wanna keep your head afloat you swim
Or sink
You gettin' riches ain't you
Remember when we kids, it's strange
It all just seems so god damn far away
From today, hey

Let's take the long way home
Break each other's bones
What your daddy don't know
Won't put no pox on his soul
You know
You haul a heavy load
Draped in your mama's gold
Think of how good you'd look if you were
A ghost
A ghost
A ghost
How good you'd look if you were a ghost

It's like that rush that you get
When you jump off high shit
When the drugs hit your lips
Or have unprotected sex
We all so damn scared
That we too close to death
We'll do anything we can
To cheat the Devil for a breath
Or feel that life in your chest
Yeah that pain gives you strength
So you run till you collapse
Chasing a fox that you can't catch
And we like it like that
Yeah don't you like it like that
Smiling like Cheshire cat
You trace your nail marks in my back
Intoxicated by that
Dangerous track
There's something oddly comforting about
Standing next to forest of black
Secretly hoping it'll engulf you
And you'll never look back
To that person that you were
Before you walked in my path

Let's take the long way home
Break each other's bones
What your daddy don't know
Won't put no pox on his soul
You know
You haul a heavy load
Draped in your mama's gold
Think of how good you'd look if you were
A ghost
A ghost
A ghost
How good you'd look if you were a ghost
