[Hook]
Someone should tell someone to tell someone to tell me the truth
I've been knocking around in my head
With these questions that I have for you
It made a convincing case and the others did too
Now I don't know who to trust him, me, or you

[Verse 1]
My father told me when he was just about nine or ten
He played a practical joke on the local postman:
Pops took his cat
Hid him inside the mailbox and closed the latch
And beat the box with a bat until the mouse surmounted an attack
Claws on tin, Louisville slugger inventing dents
His feline flailed with him fighting sighting in vain attempt
A cloud of dust on the country road marked the mailman's approach
My father dipped into the ditch to watch the chaos unfold
I don't know if you've ever trapped a cat in a bag
But they'll try to run away like a tumbleweed turned into a burlap sack
Any other animal will settle down resign on your fate
But a cat will cut a wall and claw all while running in place
The mailman was unsuspecting
That a prink had been pulled
His white truck slowly drove up to the box with the cat in its hold
His left hand handled letters, his right grabbed the latch
He turned and opened the box
My father hid back
Hid back

[Low pitched voice]
What happened after that boy, what do you think about that?
You know what happened after that well, what do you think about that?
You know what happened after that boy, what do you you think about that?
You know what happened after that, what do you think about that?

[Hook]
You know he don't want no trouble
He just wants to play
Live life like an arrow drawn with no way
Everyone he knows is always lookin' the same
Be careful what you wish for it just might just come true someday
You know he don't want no trouble
He just wants to play
Live life like an arrow drawn with no way
Everyone he knows is always lookin' the same
Be careful what you wish for it just might just come true someday

[Whispering in the background]
Be careful what you wish for

[Hook]
Someone should tell someone to tell someone to tell me the truth
I've been knocking around in my head
With these questions that I have for you
It made a convincing case and the others did too
Now I don't know who to trust him, me, or you

[Hook]
You know he don't want no trouble
He just wants to play
Live life like an arrow drawn with no way
Everyone he knows is always lookin' both ways
Be careful what you wish for it just might just come true someday
You know he don't want no trouble
He just wants to play
Live life like an arrow drawn with no way
Everyone he knows is always lookin' both ways
Be careful what you wish for it just might just come true someday
You know he don't want no trouble
He just wants to play
Wants to play (x6)

[Hook]

Someone should tell someone to tell someone to tell me the truth
I've been knocking around in my head
With these questions that I have for you
It made a convincing case
And the others did too
Now I don't know who to trust him, me, or you...

[Outro]

Careful what you wish for (Fade out)
