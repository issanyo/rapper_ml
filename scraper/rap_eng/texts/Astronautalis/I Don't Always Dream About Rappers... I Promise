It starts and I'm asleep on a pile of leaves freshly green
Falling from the trees and I am laying, falling asleep
And I look above me as my eyes slowly drift, heavy and close
I see the stars explode, sun, moon and everything goes
It's almost black and my eyes collapse, my lungs start to soften
As my heart beat relaxes and I drift down my thoughts shift
All the way into those leaves, the roots and stems and the seeds
And all of a sudden like a dozen dreams it shifts on me

I am on a date with no feet, everything else is just perfect
I am walking around, my jokes are poppin' and everything's working
I ask the girls father if I could take her out without bother
He lets me borrow the car and says "Bring her back before tomorrow"
It's all high fives and drinks, jokes cracked and chivalry
I lay my jacket down upon the puddles so she can tread on it see
I'd hate to see your pretty feet stuck inside any of the mud
Open and closing doors, pulling out her chair and showing love
And it's some dinner drinks I think and maybe that's all I get
But maybe I can sweet talk her and I can get her in bed
And I look into her eyes but her eyes are kinda blurred
So I can never see my dream girls face and understood, word

But this part of the dream all of a sudden shifts again
And I can't really recall exactly what happened to make it connect
It's just darkness, blackness I guess this is what you get
If you spend all night dreamin' and try to wake up and freestyle about it
Because even a bitta booze and no snooze makes you forget all your dreams
I'm lucky I have what I have dude so don't complain
And matter of fact, if you want something nice
Just fuckin' make it up so you can pay for the ten bucks, right?

And then it shifts again and I'm buildin' a stage for Sage Francis with friends
And I can't make sense of what's going on the stage is long as miles, kid
And I don't know where it's gonna end but we keep hammering in nails
To build this damn stage upon the show with no failing
It's not an option, Sage seems satisfied with what we built
I shake my friends hands and I say "That was great, good work for real"
And I can't see exactly who they were - I wish it was Fat Joe
So I could say I dreamed about him again and rapped in his show

And then I shift again I'm not there with friends and stage and Sage
I am standing on the sound set of a color film, babe
And I am approaching, get the kiss upon the beautiful actress' lips
They say cut, camera off - time to change the film I guess
But it's the end of the shift, the union's calling time for me to leave
I can't stand here inside of this fake set on this fake street
The water sprayed across the concrete to make it lookin' nice
There's a nice bitta moon and her make-up smudges under the heat of the lights
And she looks at me, laughs as she stares into my eyes
And I say "Hey" she says "Hey" back and "I'll see you tomorrow, right?"
She says "It's all right" maybe one day we go for dinner and drinks
And that's what I think but she doesn't say anything - just smiles and blinks
And this is it - nothing more and nothing less - a shared moment
Standing on this fake sound stage I wish I could lean for a kiss
She's beautiful as hell and it's burnin' my damn brain
But at the same time, like the rest of the dream I can't make out her damn face
A dream girl it seems burnin' right there in front of me
And I reach out and touch she disappears and bursts at the seams
A bit of smoke, a happy ghost that I wish I could hold and kiss
But all of a sudden it's like poof and she's gone into the mist
