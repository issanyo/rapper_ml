[Hook]
I know it's hopeless, Hell
Hell, ain't big enough to hold us back
Come on, let's pick a fight
We hunt for trouble tonight

I know it's hopeless, Hell
Ain't big enough to hold us back
Come on, boys, we're right!
We hunt for trouble

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You know we're right!

[Verse]
We hunt for trouble
With our fingers dipped in blood
We hold the rifles
With a hangman's heart
If reunited
'Fore the last sun lie
The snake
They cut in the parts
That come back alive for 'em
Brother Benjamin is off in France
We're taking Trenton back again
The garrison of Hessians will fall
They say Delaware will freeze a man
We chasin' sovereigns
Across the Styx and dodging ice floes
It's all on Honeyman
Our mole inside the ivy that grows
So unnatural to see this leaf
So far from its home
Must deracinate the weed
Proceed to drive the motherfucker right up out of the loam

[Hook]

[Verse]
With fingers frozen
Protractedly probing the trap
We found our trouble uncoupled
Like a mouse that pries the purse from
The yap of the victim claimed by the sprung mechanism
That broke its opponents back
While the crimson coats were bending elbows in half
WE ATTACKED!
I know you noticed the battle
It don't need quoting
It's spoken over ad nauseum
Darling, the sharpest story
Every veteran, politician, talking head'll
Get on the pedestal
Spin the saga any way
That will make their means our end

We, we've got ourselves a fight song
For the wool they'll pull over your eyes
Tell the devil that we're coming right home
Tonight, tonight. 2x

[Hook]
