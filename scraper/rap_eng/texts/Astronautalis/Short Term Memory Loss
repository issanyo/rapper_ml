You're turning off your course again
That fall would kill a stronger man
With hungry headlights closing in
St. John is looking welcoming
Death is always closer than...
Death is closer than all your friends
Death is closer than we think
He's closer than your friends and things

We drove that car into a full-on spin
I wonder just how it would feel if we dove on in
I caught a glimpse of my screaming friend
But when the sound cut out, I swore she's laughing
Shattered lights spiral and blur on in
And then rain sang along to her freckled skin
This city's just a smudge on watery lens
I couldn't help but feel helpless, so I kissed her again

Turn it off and walk away
Don't look down into those waves
You'll never be the same again
And we all suffer short term memory loss
From time to time

You got him jumping everywhere
Across the gaps and stairs
Embracing every nick and cut
And jammed finger face plant it's
He doesn't care for good repair
Soak up the sun and air
And Chipped a tooth to feel the truth
Breaking every bone he can't mend

The blood's the thing that drives the dream
That makes him think he can fall off
The blood's the thing that boils to steam
That makes machines out of our hearts

The tires breathing out
Like tired moms and troubled teens
With secret smoke breaks
Balancing between showmanship and discovery
Mister melodrama is over there covering things
Directing traffic, mumbling, like "Move it along, nothing to see"
It's such a funny dream
Its such a sight to see

Honking horns and doubled breeze
Matthews Bridge in a watercolor bleed
And I'm just standing there shifting in my skin
Sifting grate below
Fall to the rivers wash, taste my blood
Embrace my breaking bones

Turn it off and walk away
Don't look down into those waves
You'll never be the same again
And we all suffer short term memory loss
From time to time

We all suffer short term memory loss
From time to time
