Okay, this ain’t no College album, playboy
This is a professional album
Fuckin’ LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, all this
You ain’t fucking with me, Wilt Chamberlain
I got like 20,000 bitches

You call the cops on me
Just remember when times were better for Coco Beach
Making love on catamarans that the rich folks keep
Suntan, hand in hand on Spring Break week
Peace

I told you
I told you
I showed you
There’s a needle in the sky
And a holding on the air
I told you
I told you
I showed you

Kneel down in the creek
I fell down
Dark clouds, but I’m tall proud
Down on, take ours, on a half-pound
Of sad love

Cause it’s a day’s ride, just a day’s ride mama
It’s just the day is right, it’s just the day’s right sugar
Did you call me when you could’ve?
I’m gonna have to pay the guard
Going to have to pay the guard

Runaway
(I’m sorry mama)
Where the lights feel bright
(But I guess I couldn’t wear that crown
All this drama gon’ break us down)
I told you
I told you
I showed you
(Our loves the same
But we ride the waves
Cause these hurricanes...)
There’s a needle in the sky
(Where we can be safe, live our lives, side in side, right?)

I told you
I told you
I showed you

I would’ve payed ya
Staged your love, cartoon love, feather-low love
But there is nothing more
For me to join you on
For me to deploy you on
I employ you honey

Runaway
(I’m sorry mama)
Where the lights feel bright
(But I guess I couldn’t wear that crown
All this drama gon’ break us down)
I told you
I told you
I showed you
(Our loves the same
Where we ride the waves
Cause these hurricanes...)
There’s a needle in the sky
And a holding on the air
(Where we can be safe, live our lives, side in side)

I told you
I told you
I showed you
