[Hook: Astronautalis]
You're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
You're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
For the call on the telephone
That call on the telephone
You're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
You're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
For that call on the telephone
That call on the telephone

[Verse 1: Sims]
When I laughed back ' at the laugh track
I laughed hard ' from all my soft parts
And my smarts tempted to fix it ' to feed it
Into the rigid edges of what I live in, attempted
But it didn't, I'm sketching up something different, a picture
That was never pitched on thirty second clips ' This is it
And no amount of that will reconcile what's missing ' Or isn't
But don't it beckon louder if you listen now
There goes the recipe ' from the pressure that's pressing me
It tempered my tendencies too much
To render a memory ' and forge an identity
At the edge of my empathy, I've had enough
And the walls are just my cave
Or I just might find that train to come and take me away
But it's steeled in cellophane, a melamine escape
What better way to celebrate while I sit and waste the hell away

[Hook: Astronautalis]
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
For the call on the telephone
That call on the telephone
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
For the call on the telephone
That call on the telephone

[Verse 2: Astronautalis]
Hold on tight, she begged me dearly
Promise darlin', I won't let you go
City lights and the dead so clearly
Behind the soft focus on a fallen snow
Huddled close as the wind came tearing
Through the concrete canyon, my fingers
Lost their feeling, I can feel this
Creeping underneath my coat
Or that one summer evening, in the grass, fireworks above
We laughed between our kisses as the ash rained down on us
Never looked to the sky to see explosions of the light
Cause every rocket took flight was reflected in the light
Of the pale blue eyes ' of my love
But I've never seen it before ' She just went when my eyes closed
But I can feel it, surrealist, when her lips graze my earlobe
I've seen a family grow ' I lived those problems we faced
I memorized her every line and know just how her skin tastes
So go on and lay me to rest ' speak only sweetness on breath
Cause in my dreams she lives and breathes, and when I wake I am dead
But that's just tricks of the mind, the lie that loneliness buys
Some dreams are so damn beautiful you hope you never wake up
Wake up

[Verse 3: Sims]
And I've always got (got) one eye on the clock
And a nagging thought: it's something else, and I knew it
And it may not stop, and it might be my ruin
A spinning top on top of my "what the hell am I doing?"
But this is it, this is the place ' Don't let that high go to waste
I can't pull me down (down, down, down)
I don't care what grass, what shade ' I'm a turbine, spinning blade
I'm an ore, 'n drillin' but it runs me dry ' Sometimes I
Stare at your picture, wondering, "How did I get here?"
And compare your time to mine (mine, mine)
But then it hit me nowhere probably
I can blame it on the human body
Evolution to the movement, sloppy
Breaker, breaker, does someone copy?

[Hook: Astronautalis & Sims]
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah
For the call on the telephone
That call on the telephone
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah (With my hands up, and my guard down)
We're all waiting, yeah we're all, all waiting, yeah (And it pumped up, but it let down)
For the call on the telephone (And it said, "Jump!" But I stayed ground)
That call on the telephone (And nothing happened, well something happened)

[Outro: Astronautalis & Sims]
Wake up
There goes the recipe
From the pressure that's pressing me
Temper my tendencies
Too much
At the edge of my empathy
I've had enough
I've had enough
