[Verse 1]
Even after 6 months, NOLA still a wreck
The 9th ward still had water up to your chest
Under I-10, they piled dead cars
Ever seen an ambulance with high water marks?
And they don’t dance no more, all we do is flinch
Brace for that old taste that chase a strong fist
With blood on lips, and flooded bricks
Taste that whiskey kiss, born sweaty and free
Fuck a club, mu'fucker, take that shit to the streets - G

[Hook]
We were born running away from God, away from God
We were born running away, away
We were born running away from God, away from God
We were born running away

[Verse 2]
"10 euros that's cheap for sure"
He said it all in broken words
But these people ain’t got nothing
They’d rather drink what they have than buy your merch
Čadca isn’t pretty, but Tatranský works
Thick liquor dark brown, made of secret herbs
Slovakia'll get busy, they don’t need no words
And anything is a club if the speakers work – ey!
Turn it up till it shakes the rafters
No kings, no gods, no masters
Beat build  while the euro collapsing
Little kids are tagging “all cops are bastards”
AntiFa is passin’, in they old jean jackets
They don’t need no magic just to make this happen
Make out, make due, make the best of what you got
And turn the volume up till it shakes the rafters
Till it shakes the rafters
Till it shakes the rafters
Till it shakes the rafters
We make our own disasters!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ey Ey Ey Ey
We ain’t no gangsters
We ain’t no thugs
We all just flesh and blood
And we don’t need you to mess it up
We independent son, we dig our own graves
Salt our own lands, make our own plagues just for fun
And you can test us, come
We’ll be waiting by that front gate with the Beam up in our cup
And I’m dumbfound how in my home town, cops come: they all just run
Landlord wants us out: we pack our bags and shut the whole thing up
So I was like, “Aight, what you do when police come through to shake you down?”
Laughed out loud and said, “We lock them motherfuckers out!”

That's a true story
