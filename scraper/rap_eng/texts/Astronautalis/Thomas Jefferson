[Hook: Astronautalis]
Every song I sing cuts a little bit more
You could never connect the copper cast with the mold
You could never guess, you could never guess
You could never guess where I come from, no
Every mile I drive, further down this road
Tears a little more off of my bones
And you could never guess, you could never guess
You could never guess where I come from, no

[Verse 1: Astronautalis]
The first thing they was taught, was how to load and lock
Take that aim and shot, embrace the pain of shoulder blade taking stock
Watch 'em drop, pull the bolt back, load another up till the clip goes "pop"
Till you sweep your block, and you can hear a pin drop
In a place that's more comfortable with "pop pop pop pop"

The first thing they learned, was how to plant that carbine in the earth
Prop that helmet on the stock, hang them dog tags from the lock
Say your prayers and mark the spot
Where the body's interred then turn, taciturn
And take that walk, taste that salt

Sprinkle a little bit of lye in the earth, don't cry when it hurts
Cause you ain't done yet son, spill a little bit more blood
Everybody knows what comes from the warm wet red mud
Best believe, when you fall to your knees
You're gon' cry, you're gon' pray for peace
And they gonna plant them seeds of the winter wheat
And the Georgia peach watered up with your red rum

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sims]
I know he would've loved this, but he had to die to give it
I melted down his musket, turned it to a tool
Tilling like a fool to see where his blood went
See if I can grow something beautiful above it

Standing guard above my garden till the seeds take root
Taking shade under the trees with the sweet grapefruit
I'll take my yields and his old boots till the leaves shake loose
I will die in these fields, but my seeds will move

The ox and yoke know every note I hum
Written in the grass by the midday sun
The lamp lit ahead of me with the earth between my feet
I'll sing a song into the breeze, let it fold the wheat
