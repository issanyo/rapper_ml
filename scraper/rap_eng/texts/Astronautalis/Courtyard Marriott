I'm at the golden corral
In that long, long line for the Lord

You prayed for weeks until your goddamn knees bled
You can pray on the weak or be the wolves in the sheep's head

Goddamnit, we in the Southland now
And it's headed out the window, baby
And there's somehow 'bout the halo or the Heartland now
It's you and me, sharing plastic pillows
In the crease

God willing and the Creek don't rise
We'll be living inside this world for the rest of our lives
_____don't be surprised
We'll be swimming in our sin until the day that we die

In the heartland, I get sucked in
Like a dark sand in a tin can in a sun fan
Now we're marching in the head lamps
With a dark grin, and the whole band
I am cold like a coolant
I am soaring along the coastline
In this soft land, I can be your man
In a chariot, in a Courtyard
I'm talking fucking Marriott

Goddamnit, we in the Heartland now
We'll be falling out the window
And you will go out to _____
It's been a high crest, it's been a cold dream
It took me just 'til now to know how awful it would be

_____
This impossible team
Could fight the coast and be a host to deceiving themes
And that I pray that if I knew it
It would help you and the ocean's recipe
It took you just 'til now to know how awful it would be

So, go ahead and try to keep that water out your eyes
Or hold your breath and die
Swimming to the grim where there is no lie
And in that darkness high
While the world struggles to survive
You can stand in this goddamn buffet line
And wave good-bye
Watch your life flash before your eyes
