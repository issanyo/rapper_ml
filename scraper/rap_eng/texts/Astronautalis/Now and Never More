I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones
The devil chose us and she left us some
I guess it's better that we're left alone
Now and never more

You can bet you can count on them right
Had to leave you in the middle of the night
I guess it's better that we're left this way
Now and never more

Now and never more

It's just seven steps to open every lock on my door
The thick oak boards would never surrender to anything
Short of forty-fours blastin' at the hinges
Mistakes never take more than six steps without the world endin'
So I can rest assured the locks'll never give, the chains'll never flinch
And no man but God can raise the bolts from the dead
And just for pinch, I leave a chair propped under the knob
Never too certain in this world gone lost
That's why I keep every window locked, latched under key
The only thing I trust is the floor steadfast under me

I know you're wondering what would drive a man to live like this
And what would happen if you accidentally slipped and hit your head
Lying passed out on the bathroom floor
Brain leakin', body weaken as the audience stands for the curtain call
And there is me, life flash before my eyes lookin' back
And laugh at times when I cut the telephone lines
And severed all ties, shut off the water and power
Sealed off from the steel hearts atop my ivory tower
I look down every now and then and hope she'll answer my call
But I know she's gone so what's the point of ever leaving at all

Ever leaving at all
Lock the door on your way out I'm leaving it all
Behind
Goodbye

I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones
The devil chose us and she left us some
I guess it's better that we're left alone
Now and never more

You can bet you can count on them right
Had to leave you in the middle of the night
I guess it's better that we're left this way
Now and never more

Now and never more

Awake with a bottle on the night-stand
Staring at me as it sparks reactions in my right hand
Grab hold as I continue this production
Of draining these fixations after drowning in dysfunction
The light from the atmosphere induces sensitivity
And burns my retinas in a fashion that convinces me
That this must be my punishment for those mistakes
That kept piling up until it crumbled on the sixth day
Now I stand in a carnival of nervous fans
Waiting for the moment to escape inside the caravan
Slam the door and tell the driver to accelerate
Toss my heavy baggage out and watch it all disintegrate
Sitting on a cushion still warm and broken in
From the last passenger that's still running from unspoken sins
Pull over, let me walk before the [rust?] grabs me
I will avoid all of the signs that say 'No Trespassing'

Step foot onto a trail of forgotten soles
Failing to admire cautions deeming me responsible
Head first without the proper education
Tampers with my pulse and my uneasy ventilation
Exhale watch the air escape my lips
Racing towards the surface as the current and the water shifts

There's no need to attempt to see her face
If I break the plan today I won't live past Thursday
So now I chose to become one with this tide
If it lands me on the shore where my integrity resides
Eyes closed it will work itself out
Alone and short-winded it will work itself out

I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones
The devil chose us and she left us some
I guess it's better that we're left alone
Now and never more

You can bet you can count on them right
Had to leave you in the middle of the night
I guess it's better that we're left this way
Now and never more

Now and never more
