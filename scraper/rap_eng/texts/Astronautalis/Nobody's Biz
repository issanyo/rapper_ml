[Verse: P.O.S]
Y'all can stay locked in the struggle
I been out back-flipping, dog I go hard
Watch what you say out your muzzle (what you say out your muzzle)
I've had it up to here, gets me so fired up
I ain't nothing but trouble (ain't nothing but trouble)
Boy, I beat up a beat, don't lemme start
Get your ass up on the double
Get your ass up! I said (Get your ass up! I said)

I'm moving forward, there’s casualties
Sorry
I’m sick of distortions
Need honesty now
But there's nothing suggesting it's coming
These cowards are capable killers
That's shits inescapable! Pow!
No cops! Yes, now!
No cops! Yes, now!
No skipping progress, babe
No contest
Shits played out!
No cops! Yes, NOW!

I'm out here repping myself
Fuck is you looking at? Do you need help?
I am broken beyond recognition
Still it's better than any prescription they dealt
I am over the same conversations
Either do it or don't, I don’t care how you felt
I am motion made into a human
I am stardust on stardust on stardust on stardust I'm gone

[Chorus: P.O.S & Astronautalis]
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home
In front of my home

[Verse: Astronautalis]
Some people look at me cross-eyed when I tell em I own guns
You should see how they jaw drop when I tell em I want more
I ain't talkin' a sawed off to keep thieves from my front door
I want a Glock and an auto cause I don't trust the cops y'all

You say it’s paranoia, paranoia
All I do is laugh back
They spyin' on ya, spyin' on ya
Everybody's phone tapped
You takin' orders? Takin' over?
Exactly where you stand at?
Understand that
This man strapped, ay

This about time all my liberal friends start sweatin'
Speakin in NPR voices with stern glances
Pullin' out stats faster than cops pull they weapons 'round Blacks
With their pants sagged and their snap-backs
Turned back with their hands up
Any fucking questions? Ay

It’s fucked up, we all know it baby
Question is, why the fuck we waitin'?
For some president to come fix the nation?
We takin' aim to fix ourselves
Y'all can fix ya faces

[Chorus: P.O.S & Astronautalis]
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home
In front of my home

I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home-ome

I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
'Bout time I'mma put my facemask on
'Bout time I'mma put my facemask on
'Bout time I'mma put my facemask on
'Bout time I'mma put my facemask on

[Chorus: P.O.S & Astronautalis]
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home

I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot riot of my own
I want a riot, white riot riot right in front of my home
