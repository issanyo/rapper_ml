[Verse 1]
You start to run
There’s a loner and a rebel, Dottie
Some friends’ll get hitched
And others get hooked proper
You, you’ll never achieve either
Fallin in love with dreams
Relapse into reefer, yeah
You ain’t won and ain’t lost
Too light enough to drift along
Too heavy to float off
But this, this is just a good time
Ya ain’t a fuckin’ party if you do it every night
You’re just hip bones and modern day heartache
Plotting your escape from the plains and towns
Named for lost saints
Small change, huntin’ for the big bills
Divorce the heels and just bullets for the big kill
[?] field the [?] for laughter
Cocaine has changed the dolls and fames to flappers
Snow banks fade away and they flood the pasture
Remains of the flames and the sins of past lives, yeah

[Hook]

Papillon
One day we’ll all be gone
Papillon

One day we’ll all be gone

[Verse 2]
You start to run
As a dreamer with a drug hobby
Some friends will get hitched
And others get hooked proper
You, you’ll never achieve either
Plot against the odds and
Backslide into even, yeah
You ain’t won and ain’t lost
Strong enough to stay clean
Weak to fuck off
But this, this is just a good time
It ain’t a real escape ‘til you sever all the ties
You’re just simple, strivin’ to be offbeat
Searchin’ for a zip-code
Off a real small stage
Present for your Tinder
Lookin’ for a dimepiece in a time
A temple is the only nice place, yeah
No encore, no applause
Just a still in the sun before the snow will fall
In the spring, there will come
The reveal it all the graves
And your rays and the sins of Fridays past

[Hook]

One day we’ll all be gone
