It's just a little further baby gotta get what she wants... Gotta drown it out
It's just a little further baby gotta get what she needs... Gotta build it up

The famous waves escaping all my lame attempts to drag them in & ride to safety. Hate me. This is a coronation decorate me in your favorite, sinking, maybe, save me. Save me. Save me

It's just a little further baby gotta get what she wants... We're all lost at sea
It's just a little logic we're all crazy for it... My god the stars are falling in
He's just a little lazy we all have walked it lady... Slipped off and falling in
It's such a lovely evening baby wants to go for a walk... It's easy friend

"I don't think that they're gonna like this. How often am I gonna do this? Who makes songs about this crap? I don't think the album has enough rap songs, y'know? *sigh* When am I gonna get over this shit?"
