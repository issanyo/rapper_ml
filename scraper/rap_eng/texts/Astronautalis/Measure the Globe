Sitting on a futon mat, in a squat in Darmstadt
Kevin Seconds said to me in passing
"Age never meant shit to me, It's all about heart and stupidity"
I thought there's no better way to live
We were on the steps in Brno
When she bit my lip and choked my throat
A hi-ball glass shattered above our heads
It seemed her lover listened through the walls
While we were kissing, arm in arm
I left and spent the night alone instead

I couldn't tell you dear, which one whispers in my ear
The Devil or St. Andrew... but I know its time to go
I'm sure you've got a great theory
If I'm hunting something or its haunting me
I know there ain't no right way to measure the globe
Oh no, oh no

I know what you dream of, I dream of it too
Of roads that are endless and rooms that are huge
Are these visions of heaven or nightmares I'm living?
All I know, is I'm scared of the truth
And if the world could end very soon
And all we've accomplished is moot
I'll coat the carpet in gasoline
Strike our last match and leave
Before the whole house is consumed
So I'll cover my hand in tattoos
I'll kiss any woman that moves
There's no Lord to forgive me
And physics is tricky
So all that I'm left with is you
So all that I'm left with is you
So all that I'm left with is you

I couldn't tell you dear, which one whispers in my ear
The Devil or St. Andrew... but I know its time to go
I'm sure you've got a great theory
If I'm hunting something or its haunting me
I know there ain't no right way to measure the globe
Oh no, oh no.... oh no
