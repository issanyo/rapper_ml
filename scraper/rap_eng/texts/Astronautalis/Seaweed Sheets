Amongst the tires and broken trees
All washed up on rubble beach
You were the best lover I never loved
Tucked beneath the seaweed sheets
Little scraps of shells and sand caked around your shaky hand
As the little fingertips slide inside my belt loop again
Your matted hair and sappy stare lost inside the haze of the sun
Stumbling in a three legged race
You lean on me the whole way back home
You can never guess what you find washed up on a shore
On the sunny day after a storm

I left her there in bed that day
To watch a hotel hauled away on the back of trucks
Among stacks of bricks, lithographs of seaside scenes
Flap in the breeze the canvas ripped
I guess I'm scared to wake up next to her
Or maybe I'm too scared to ever fall asleep
Comfortably coiled in a tide pool at the edge of the beach
I watch the world wake up as the sun leaves a land of the stucco bleached
My stomach rocks with waves, a smile is tossed on my face
Cement feet drag me neck deep, sometimes a bit of trouble is great

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in

We never leave a ransom
We fill your car wash up with drugs
We drink our beer in the shower
We leave your house without locking up
Round here the days are just packed
With same smirking faces and the same haircuts

The city's a boarding school with rigid hemlines and golden rules
A grid of pictures yellow light highlighting chosen few
Look we made the news again, me and my old friends....YEAH RIGHT!
I'm sick, she's a communist, he's pissed were all monuments
To the greatest hair-dos of the modern age
Lets escape, we can smoke cigarettes and comb the woods for dirty magazines
Sneak out ruin or shoes and hide from no one inside the (BREATH)
When they fill us in on exactly what me missed
We'll never talk about the nervous little breaths
Tomorrow when we're retracing our all our shaky little steps
We'll never tell a soul that we kissed
We'll never tell a soul that we kissed
We'll never tell a soul that we kissed
We'll never tell a soul that we kissed
We'll never tell a soul about this

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in

We, we lost it all again
Till everything came back again
Floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in

We washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean
I picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave
The wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth
We rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out
We lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again...
Floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in

We washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean
I picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave
The wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth
We rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out
We lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again...
Floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in

We washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean. (We, we lost it all again)
I picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave
The wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth, (We, we lost it all again)
We rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out
We lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again... (We, we lost it all again)
Floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in

We washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean. (We, we lost it all again)
I picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave
The wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth, (We, we lost it all again)
We rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out
We lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again... (We, we lost it all again)
Floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in

We washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean. (We, we lost it all again.....)
