Face it, you're not
You're not for me
Face it
You won't set me free

It seemed like a good idea at the time
The way the roads to hell are designed
I should have left well enough alone
I'm better off counting toothpicks

I can't be anything you like
No matter how hard you fucking try
I'm hanging up the phone
Ain't no right way to ride this cruise ship

You can call me crying every night
You can send that coke head to pick a fight
I'll take the split lips and black eyes
This song is fucking stupid

I know I'm foolish to think
That I can make a difference
But I've got a problem with drinking
And throwing kitchen sinks

Face it, you're not for me
You can't set me free

This city isn't just a skyline
Your problems are more than white lies
Your hands look so small
When they're sitting in mine

This city isn't just a skyline
Your problems are more than white lies
Your hands look so small
When they're sitting in mine

This city isn't just a skyline
Your problems are more than white lies
Your hands look so small
When they're sitting in mine
