I'm a man who fell in love with a house and a couch
A whole lonely kingdom a mouse could carve out
The smell of dried wood, lost love-letters left out
The space heaters believers got their reaoners down

Sit silent and smile and take in this evening
Cinnamon dreaming, lazy breathing, the anachronist grieving
Well the kitchen's a stone's throw, think the toilet is leaking
Pump the place full of gasoline but damn it I ain't leaving

Well Christmas said goodbye
Christmas never came
Christmas showed up in July and now that bastard's here to stay
And I don't really mind if no gifts come my way
As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades
And always let me stay

I'm a man who fell in love with some stones and a one-legged bird
And cat that don't like me stepping on cracks and curbs
The spiral staircase is laughing as I just slip like a jerk
I'm sorry if I get too tipsy from toasting your worth

You don't ever have to wake me it's all just the same
I sleep like a hooker with a bullet in her brain
Bury me down in the tomb of blankets and some old sheets
If Christmas is here to stay well then you'll never get me to leave

And Christmas said goodbye
And Christmas never came
Christmas showed up in July and now that bastard's here to stay
And I don't really mind if no gifts come my way
As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades
And always let me stay

Always let me stay

Me stay
Let me stay

All right
Everybody now

Christmas said goodbye
(Goodbye)
Christmas never came
(Never came)
Christmas showed up in July
(In July)
And now that bastard's here to stay
(Again)
And I don't really mind
(Don't mind)
If no gifts come my way
(No gifts)
As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades
And always let me stay
