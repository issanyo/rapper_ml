Girl you should know this
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
And I've been watching you, right

At night I dream of you
I want to be your baby, lady
If your game is strong, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you

Everyday I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my friend
I want you, I need you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out, every weekend
Just to see my boo, yeah yeah yeah

At night I dream of you
I want to be your baby, lady
If your game is strong, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you
