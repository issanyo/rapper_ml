[Intro: Astronautalis and P.O.S]

[Chorus: Astronautalis and P.O.S]
No calm, no hesitation
No alarms, no self-preservation
Just nerves and ashtrays and on and on
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
No sleep without assistance
Gotta bash the brain into submission, yeah
Just close the windows and lock the doors
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Astronautalis]
You'll never take me alive but you can try it
I swear there's safety I find laying with lions
My brain is sharpening knives on my silence
[P.O.S] And everybody swears they got a right to know huh?
I'm pounding nails in the oak with some old slag
Shoulda known better than to think they would hold back
I boarded up the windows with fence post slats
[P.O.S] I swear the man took a look inside as he rolled past
I'm raising my flagpole to find my gold 'gats and rag up
(Mmmhmm, Mmmhmm)
I'm wearing my bare feet drinking the Jim Beam from a plastic cup
(Mmmhmm, Mmmhmm)
Of course there's some poison underneath the sink, there's more than enough
(Mmmhmm, Mmmhmm)
Good fences make good neighbors, go ahead friend and call my bluff

[Verse 2: P.O.S]
Ah, Sid Vicious version of "My Way‚Äù;
Scary loud, hurtin' 'em, cursing
I'm working the nerves of a little bird
Who told you what? Lies? Right, hah what
Tell 'em I took more and I was often offered less
But went right ahead anyway
Let 'em know that I will not be thrown
And if that's how you gauge your trust, get goin'
Get a lock, get hidden, get smokes, get safe no kiddin'
No jokes, no place for children
No diggin', I swear it
This head seeks yours and you should not explore the depths of it
Just recollect your common sense and run
Period

[Chorus: Astronautalis and P.O.S.] (x2)
