I'd grown accustomed to the touching
The stares and the umbrellas
That you held atop my hairs
When the subtle rain befell us

The acrobat safely steps
Above the safety net
Faced the lengthy stretch
And didn't even seem to sweat the place of the net

Whether he taste the grace of the final place
Or face the hated misstep
He trusts the heart string net
Will always be there dressed to catch

I make mistakes like the next but I never make regrets
I'm not upset I climbed those steps and tried and tried to cross that thing
I don't blame you or anyone when we cut strings
But I don't look forward to interviewing the new applying sets of arms
That will catch me and protect me from the potential bodily harm
Catch me and protect me with their wit and charm

So I raise the sacred bar and take a charge across that bloody cable
Audience applause will let me cross and
Take a step into my quest and try to hold my body stable
Take a guess at future's next and wonder when I fall in
And who's the next to come along and try and save you
I'm game to
Talking and maintaining the friendship
But I know that will never fit because it will always be second best

Mothers cover their children's eyes
Children peek through it
And everyone held their breath
Cause I was working without a net

And everyone held their breath
Cause I was working without a net
And everyone held their breath
Cause I was working without a net
And everyone held their breath
Cause I was working without a net
And everyone held their breath
Cause I was working without a net
