Baptized and salt skinned with bitten lips
I pass by all lost in the sketchy lead
Lines of breadcrumbs retraced for the ride
Bathed in the blue light of perfect American nights
American nights

Funny ride, lovely night, song sets pace
Young lovers sing along through touched face
True love waits in shallow waters under darkened skies
Preying on handcuffed hands of solid plans and blacked out eyes

We're killing cowboys left and right again with guilty little trips, recycled cans
Gimme whiskey lips and dirty hands
Everyone's got a ribbon all of a sudden and a soapbox to stand

Starry-eyed and shitfaced on their plans, let's call the supermodels
And of your fucking favorite bands
And ask them just exactly what they've got planned
To save us from our own impending doom

They were baptized and salt skinned with bitten lipped smiles
Bitten lipped smiles all lost in (all lost in)...
"Oh God, how you grow, oh God how you grow."
Meet me here later and we'll make out

They were broke bones and paint chips
With bitten lip smiles, bitten lip smiles and soft hands
"Oh Lord, how you shine, oh Lord how you shine."
Meet me here later and we'll make out

[Interlude]
Ready?
Yeah I'm ready
OK, let's do this then

The last ones roll bowling balls right down 3rd street
Doing donuts through the front lawns, keg in back seat
Paint stained pants, gas huff, make out, and bleed
Mr. Mouthful of bugs has pockets packed with popcorn seeds
It cost me nothing, cost me nothing, cost me nothing, cost me
Assholes all obsessed with spelling
Sweaty out of breath from yelling
Chase them up and down the ceiling
Fuck your bleeding heart
Take another twenty, buddy
All we need is murder money
Czek swore I'd laugh at anything

They were baptized and salt skinned with bitten lipped smiles
Bitten lipped smiles all lost in (all lost in)...
"Oh God, how you grow, oh God how you grow."
Meet me here later and we'll make out

They were broke bones and paint chips
With bitten lip smiles, bitten lip smiles and soft hands
"Oh Lord, how you shine, oh Lord how you shine."
Meet me here later and we'll make out
