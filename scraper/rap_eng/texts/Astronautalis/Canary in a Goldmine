Front gate of the bank
Looks like some pearly gates
Praying on salvation
Locked inside a safe
Safe deposit box
We as sly as fox
Road, hauled in
Rocking presidential linens
Guns cocked, up inside our church clothes
Tucked
Shotguns with the tips all sawed off
Looking like some bosses
Suits tailored specially
Fuck a pocket square
Yeah, my Glock is my accessory
No fucking questions, see
Just respect our needs
And we gon' need you on the ground now, pretty please
If you wanna run your mouth
Then get meet by heat
I'm a nice guy but Mr.Mossberg is mean

Looked the guard in the eyes
He ain't tryin' shit
Bitch, you're 59, almost at retirement
He's just trying to survive
Think of the wife and kids
Old man got not place to catch crooks
He's just tryin' to fish

I hit the teller with a grin
She winks back, I swear she tryna to holler at a pimp
Filling up our duffel bags with G-stacks and gold bricks
Just before we flee the scene, she hits me with a slow kiss
Take off and blast
First class motherfuckers with they foot on the gas
We got two bags full of cash
Two bags full of gold bars
Ghost dog
Gone before the cops catch wind

I'm all alone
And I need our Lord
So, hurry home, and I'll write my wrongs
He's gonna sing my song

There's always one punk motherfucker who wanna sing a song
Like canary getting scared deep inside a coal mine
But they're the first ones to die
When they let notes fly
I'ma end they life before they even reaching the prize
I should have known it, right?
Them religious types, they can't hold they sins in
Yeah, the guilt eats them alive
So on his knees, before his priest
With his gaze in his eyes
Think it's secrets they keep, but it's all just a lie
See, the chief of police, he's one powerful guy
And that creepy old priest, he likes his boys on the side
So when he's chained to the seat
To toss a favor to chief
Get out of jail free card to use down the line
So while I'm sitting in a strip club with some hands on some thighs
Tipping whiskey back, throwing big bills in the sky
Down the block, this fucking schmuck is singing the song of his life
I'll meet him in the yard and put a fucking shiv in his spine
