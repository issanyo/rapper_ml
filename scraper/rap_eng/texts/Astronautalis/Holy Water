Well, it's hope, it's hope that has me staring to the burning sky
I know, I know there's something hidden on the other side
I woke, I woke with such a feeling I could never rise
Now I'm gazing skyward til the sun just burns me blind
Burns me blind
Burns me blind

Burns me blind
Burns me blind

Well, one drank of the holy water, hoping for the light
While the other slipped a sewing bodkin right inside his eye
And they ran out from the city calling, collecting salts and lye
Crack and crush it, burn it maybe, baby, find the God inside
God inside
God inside

God inside
God inside

We know there's something to which we're blind
Because it's hope that pulls us forward til we die

Ollie ollie oxen free, come out from where you hide
Tell me, tell me what you want from me
I promise I'll provide
I'll drink your poison, I'll keep you company
Serve you til I die
Come on, crack Pandora's Box for me
Blind me with the light
With the light
With the light

With the light
With the light

Learn the language of our holy fathers, retrace the sacred rites
Plot and chart the arc of Halley's Comet, floating through the night
I drain my blood until my chalky body floats closer to the sky
I DANCE UPON THE EDGE OF DEATH, JUST TO PROVE THAT I'm ALIVE

I'm ALIVE
I'm ALIVE

I'm ALIVE
I'm ALIVE

We know there's something to which we're blind
Because it's hope that pulls us forward til we die
