[Verse 1]
Yea go ha ha
I see how it is
You be all like
I’m going to move to San Fran
But I end up in Oakland
Aim for Brooklyn then head home in hoboken
This week we worship Beyonce
Like she ain't just Pepsi
We are frontin' like we stuntin'
Praying the world never forget
We seen your sorrows in your selfies
That up on instagram you flexin'
Pray to base God every night
For that basic bitch protection
Now I get drunk and rub my eye
Get up all in that aggressive
Pick up an awful amount of regrets
I know my momma raised me better
Baby I’m anarchist still on my Florida shit
If I ever sold a million records
I will dunk a fucking whip and
These new rappers hate me for
Rocking some gold fronts
But I hate me to freestyle and
Smoking blunts and I’m bad at
Sagging my nuts enough is enough but
Up and die from fucking touring too much
Still mother fuckers be like
Why don’t you play in my town
Trying to find a nice way to say it sucks
And then bounce almost a millions mile bro
And done put up a whip went from sleeping in cars
To stuffing and catching pimping the motel until 6
And I never worked that hard to end up on a slam
Pulling of kits and I’m yelling drawed all that was
Just for fucking emphasis but lazy writer still draw that
Line on every page
They ask me at every interview how I came up with my name
You failed guitarist couldn't do a fucking google search
You plagiarized my bio that I wrote you fucking nerd
But hey they just lonely like the rest of us
Waiting up all night for the light to text me
So just the question that is stressing us
How much of that food are you really willing to put in
So you can see them effortless
