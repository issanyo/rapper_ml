I should've torn out your black heart and given it away
As you stood on that exact spot on that rainy day
I should've turned and just walked off, never said a thing
But fuck it, if I was that smart I'd never learned your name

I couldn't tell you how it all starts, but I know just how it ends
Baby, we were born to burn out, not fade away
I WON'T FADE AWAY!
So come on, take my hand, doll, and don't let go again
We'll run till we both fall or burst into flames!
We'll burst into flames!

One hand strikes the match, one hand guards the flame
We were born to burn out baby

We will never fade away
