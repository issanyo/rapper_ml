[Hook]
I dreamed up the maps
Give me charcoal and the paper now
We invent paths they cannot see
And they're too scared t' walk
Between my hands rests fifty-two plain old playing cards
And I trapped God somewhere between
The trump and the kind of hearts

[Bridge]
Joni Mitchell said "We are stardust
We are golden, we are all the same"
Blood paints the story of our love
Across the bathroom floor towards the drain

Funny how everything just piles up, till one day
You can't believe how far you came
I'm made of mountains, made of metal
Made of whiskey, and waves!
You won't believe your own breath
When the bold words finally escape your mouth
Keep your secrets hidden
Till yer certain of just what we've found
Yeah, they bleed just like us
But our calling is what shapes us now

Won't be held back, won't be tied up
Won't be pinned down (x4)

Won't be held back
Won't be - not now!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It came to me, as strange as it seems
From a simple deck of cards laid ace to kings
With my fingernail slipped under King Charlemagne
I flipped the edge and traced the grain
And watched it fall like a breaking wave
The ace of spades was last to splash
Trump to suicide kings, they all turned Bicycle backs
I stared at the pattern, a pair of seraphim flashed
And it just fit, elegant, "aww shit!". That's that
Its strange how you can waste away pained with one thing
The watchmaker breaks sweat, he can't tame a dumb spring
Then one day its as plain as the nose above your smug grin
Like, "look what the cat dragged in!"
Woke from a dream, hands heavy in cold sweat
Jumped from the bed, snatched the charcoal quick
Sketching frantically upon the bedroom brick
It came together and it fit like this:
"Give me a lever and a place to stand, I'll move the world"
You think you're clever, but you never, seen how it really works

[Hook]
