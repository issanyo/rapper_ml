This is a song for all the punk kids
Who turned handsome and got old
A romantic for lost souls
I said hey, this is the song for all the dumb shit
That you stand for and lost hope
It's been a long time, my how you have grown

I’ve been a pair of legs, forever walking
Mark miles in cement from the cradle to the coffin
Met many a loser, caught a couple of keepers
Ate lunch with a prince once that drove a street sweeper
This prince is a bean pole, with tussled hair and funny socks
Yankee crown crusader, mister mutton chops
Six foot something unbuttoned, a tall stretch of royalty
Was steady as a chevy, with old yeller loyalty
Now the street sweeping lives the life of a loner and
On a night like tonight he came upon a panicky homeowner
Pulled the sweeper to the curb to hear her saga sing
She said "my house is on fire, save my daughters and quick!"
The mother and daughters in question
Were well known throughout the land
A talk drink of ex beauty queen sought by many a man
Her daughters were all followers of her beautiful traits
Longhaired songbirds whose midtown movements
Were smooth enough to stop parades
The prince jumped into action without further ado
Asked for some direction to the blaze current consumed
And upon arriving flames, rising eyes widened by the roaring fire
He saw the girls hanging from five different stories
He rolled his sleeves to his elbows, pulled his cap to his crown
Hails the jumbled letters of courage and sighs it out
Steps inside the house, feels the heat upon his face
Praised the ghost of Johnny Cash and steps inside the place

Hey, this is a song for all the punk kids
Who turned handsome and got old
A romantic for lost souls
I said hey, this is the song for all the dumb shit
That you stand for and lost hope
Its been a long time, my how you have grown

There were hollers for help from every direction
Nearly naked in night things the girls vie for his protection
The first was the worst deceptively heavy
Pleading protection of rings and things exceptionally petty
The second was restless limited faith
Questioning the prince is this really gonna be safe
The third was a burden the prince shrugged it away
The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth were all the same
Begging him to save their dog and carry their dress
Burying the prince in flickering smiles and selfish requests
But he still picked up, lifted up, everyone left
Two girls on each arm one on his head four on his chest
Each set of lips had a private wish on flowered breath
Each curving hip had him going back into the mess
Quitting was no option even if it lead to his death
Even the best have fallen even the greatest will fail a test
But after loads and burdens filled with clothes and curtains
His throat is hurting and death is certain the prince returns into the burning building
Losing feeling in his fingertips and arms
Overwhelmed by all the effort, our good Samaritan succumbs
On his slow decent his eyes focused in on a shiny silhouette racing to hold onto his hand -
It's the last of the daughters, fairest of hand and face
Picture of grace slim carrying but bearing a sudden strength

Hey, this is a song for all the punk kids
Who turned handsome and got old
A romantic for lost souls
I said hey, this is the song for all the dumb shit
That you stand for and lost hope
Its been a long time, my how you have grown

She looks into the prince's eyes just before his vision fades
Holds his hand and whispers "it's gonna be ok"
Picks up his broken frame and steps out of the flames
Lays him in the grass as the house collapses into the blaze
While all the other daughters are crying over diamonds
They forget about the prince laying unconscious and silent
Except for the last worried by the man
Waits for his eyes to open, never letting go of his hand

Hey, this is a song for all the punk kids
Who turned handsome and got old
A romantic for lost souls
I said hey, this is the song for all the dumb shit
That you stand for and lost hope
Its been a long time, my how you have grown

The prince told me this tale somber with a straight face
Over some cups of bitter coffee and couple blue plates
And i trust his every word as I’d known him all my life
But if you don’t believe my story go ask the prince’s wife
