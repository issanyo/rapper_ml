[Hook: Astronautalis]
Everyone who's drinking
Is already drunk or sleeping
Everyone who isn't
Is just too political to talk to
Another summer evening
The city's barely breathing
Just ain't the same
Without you

[Verse 1: Astronautalis]
There ain't no magic in materials
Magic's in our words
Then we whisper in each others' ears
To make diamonds out of dirt
There ain't no glory in the silken things
Glory's in the hurt
And can split your skin from end to end
Down the center of the earth

[Hook]
I said Everyone who's drinking
Is already drunk or sleeping
Everyone who isn't
Is just too political to talk to
Another summer evening
The city's barely breathing
Just Ain't the same
Without you

[Verse 2: Astronautalis]
I wasn't joking 'bout my burial
Backyard's what I prefer
But my landlord wouldn't like that
I Gotta own a backyard first
So I keep singin y'all these spirituals
Pray it lifts the curse
Keeps me chasing ghosts of dreams from funeral to birth
In reverse (x6)
Keeps me chasing ghosts of dreams from funeral to birth

[Hook]
Everyone who's drinking
Is already drunk or sleeping
Everyone who isn't
Is just too political to talk to
Another summer evening
The city's barely breathing
Just ain't the same
Without you
