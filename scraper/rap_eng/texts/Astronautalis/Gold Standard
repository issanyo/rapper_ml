Nobody, not even your friends
Keep that Jim Beam close
Keep your head in your hands
Trust nobody, not even nobody

Catch me up under your bed with my hand on the tech
You're getting no respect, all you get is distress
I'll be looking in your mailbox, waiting on cheques
I'll be following your girl home from T.J.Maxx
Put it all together like a puzzle connects
You can count on me, you see
Like a fucking watch, Creflo, tic toc
My Lincoln right down your block
It ain't never gon stop
I'll be that gold standard

Papa didn't raise no fool
Mama didn't raise no dummy
Cool at making money
I was unbecoming
And I was always thumbing up and under the carnival roof
I hope I'll see you soon
Shower me in positive proof

I ain't got no chain
I ain't need no chain
You and I been needing to train it
Just be all up on your knees to claim it
And you duller with a rise
With a knife stuck in his side
In the paid-for bedroom
They been left room
Semper will it Fi

Nobody, not even your friends
Keep that Jim Beam close
Keep your head in your hands
Trust nobody, not even nobody

Stop me now
