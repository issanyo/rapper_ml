Just as the last of the hay was cut today
The threshers were resting, gelding slow in his gait
The sun's work is done but he's still flush in the face
Across the wet sky spreads an inky black stain

An episode of sparrows
Like you've never seen
An episode of sparrows
That you wouldn't believe

An obsidian stream of petite passerines
Swiftly eclipsing Helios' beams
My wife, oblivious, whistling, snapping beans
Witnessed a sight mine eyes had never seen

An episode of sparrows
Spelling my name
An episode of sparrows
A flawless display

An airborne ballet, the swarming songbirds spell my name
Quite deftly expressed by amassing each letter's shape
In this, they confessed they suffered from hunger pains
And failure to feed them to taste would lead them to lay waste to my hay

So

An episode of sparrows
Shaking me down
An episode of sparrows
Committing racketeering

Knowing the cost if I lost my crops
The thought of my wife packing bags and running home
With no choices left my heart sank in my chest
On an exhaling breath I shouted, "Honey, we're having guests... I guess."

An episode of sparrows
Has eaten all my food
An episode of sparrows
Has drank all my booze
An episode of sparrows
Didn't do no damn dishes
An episode of sparrows
Flew off all fat and drunk on my shit
