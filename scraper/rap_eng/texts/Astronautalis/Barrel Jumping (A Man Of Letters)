[Intro]
Well sometimes
I think that you
Meet someone
You
Give and you give
And you give until there’s nothing left
No matter what
It’s never, ever going to be good enough for them

[Verse I]
Drove up to the river with the barrel in the back of the trunk
The grilled chased the carrot moon the headlights hang out in front
Mr. Merle and Johnny Cash swear I’m leaving at once
I punch the gas the leaves all laugh
The wind wheezes and coughs
The water wash sprays off, pinpricks my lips
Wet wood fram, moonlight barely, barrel slips
I came too far to watch it drift off now I can't
Let my ship slide alone right off the cliff
Right off the cliff
Right off the cliff

[Verse II]
I could’ve said you were rust
I could’ve told you that I loved you to death
Make a “me” of memories, cheap talk and wasted breath
Wave my hat, beat my chest, ride this thing till it hits
You love the mess, I’ll give you one that you never forget
A man of letters knows the best of broken nets and frayed respects
The promised catch of a cloud of breath or a fog in wind set
Hands that get and hands that beg and hands that always forget
You count on the tips but you can never ever count on the catch
Count on the catch
Count on the catch

[Verse III]
My little ship drifts with the leaves and water spraying across my lips
Mr. Moon’s good work, blue earth been kissed
The tube shifts, soft hiss in the sparkling mist
That old lift in your falling chest just before the hit
Never thought it would come to this
My parents never taught me to drift
Something I learned watching bridges burn down to sticks
There’s nothing left but a mess of splinters, flailing limbs
The water sounds just like the record’s end
Just like the record’s end
Just like the record’s end

[Outro]
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big parade no big checks
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big bang there’s no big mess
There’s no big bang there’s no…
