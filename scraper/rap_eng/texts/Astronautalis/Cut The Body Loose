We're all just waiting
For you to breathe
My knees bleed from praying
You'll wake from your sleep
Can't hear what I'm saying
No matter how I scream
We know the world
Is wasted on me
We know the world
Is wasted on me

The city still just a nightmare
Too quiet to handle
I drove through the night to get there
In spite of the damage
Had to come down a fire trail
Just to make our way home
Ain't no street signs up on any of them roads
Ain't no streets left to put them signs back on

Hey buddy
Go on put that map down
This ain't that town no more
Them signs ain't no use
Go on turn back now
Don't act proud
I think it's about time
To cut the body loose
Don't you think it's about time
We cut the body loose

We're all just waiting
For you to breathe
My knees bleed from praying
You'll wake from your sleep
Can't hear what I'm saying
No matter how I scream
We know the world
Is wasted on me
We know the world
Is wasted on me

Your hair broken by your surface
Like it birthed you
Crawled back on that bike
Empty handed too
You couldn't stand for it
Dragging him with you
I know you had to cut the body loose
I know you just had to cut the body loose
I think it's about time
We cut the body loose
Cause I don't know how this can end
But I know we can't keep holding our breath

We're all just waiting
For you to breathe
My knees bleed from praying
You'll wake from your sleep
You can't hear what I'm saying
No matter how I scream
We know the world
Is wasted on me
We know the world
Is wasted on me
