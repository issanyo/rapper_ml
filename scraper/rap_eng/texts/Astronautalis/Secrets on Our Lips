I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this
The moonlight makes us ardent and the sun returns our sense
But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this
But we can live forever with secrets on our lips

We work in secret under cover of darkness
Hands steadied by the weight of a lie
Broke branches, codes, and chalk markings
I'll leave a trail only you can find

All the alleys in Manhattan are gone, kid
They sold the shadows when the rent got high
So we sneak into the Central Park and
Work in secret for the rest of the night

We work in secret for the rest of the night
We work in secret for the rest of the night
We work in secret for the rest of the night
And keep it all a lie

I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this
The moonlight makes us ardent, the sun returns our sense
But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this
But we can live forever with secrets on our lips

We found a crawl space behind the vending machines
Pressed each other against each other until we fell asleep
Woken shirtless arm in arm by a cleaning lady's screams
Her bottom lip was swollen from being pressed between my teeth

I could have stayed there for weeks hands in her hair
Hands creeping innocent under the waist of my jeans
Fingertips tracing the shape of our lips
We spoke in breaths and that's it

It's not a bad life to live making out all day
Living off the food and drinks inside the vending machines
The sun's wide awake she rode off on her bike alone
I never saw her again, we never speak

The night before I met the girl I swore would change my life
Move across the country try to break a wild horse to a wife
But that heartbreak was years away, right?
And this girl was right here with locks to pick and trees to climb

I remember you well at the Thunderbird Motel
We were talking just so strange and so sweet
Two bits will buy you ten on the vibrating bed
I kissed your skin behind the vending machine

If you ask me right now why I never did tell
Anyone about our evening with me
I don't know, hell
Some secrets are just things that you keep

I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this
The moonlight makes us ardent and the sun returns our sense
But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this
But we can live forever with secrets on our lips

With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips

With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips
With secrets on our lips
