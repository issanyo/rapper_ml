Father up in Burlington Coat Factory
Stealing a coat, sipping on a daiquiri
Actually, Imagine me:
Dating the same damn freak for a week
You're motherfuckin' true to love

From where I was standing
In the dream of the old boat lander
I said "hey" to the old red verandas
Old flames came and we shared those old companions
Then we mashed, actually crashed into the canyons

In the yard, we lay with foxes
Sleep where your mom's head motherfuckin'-

Got some brand new heels, but I love her lips
Even though she got some-
She was down to fuck
Brand new heels, but I love her lips
Even though she got some herpes on it
