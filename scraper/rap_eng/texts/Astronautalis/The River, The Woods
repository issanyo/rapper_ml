[Verse 1]
Where ever we go, we'll never be lost
Some follow the compass rose, some follow the cross
Me, I follow roads compulsively, till sirens call me off
Then I wander, eyes closed, following songs
This rivers a hymnal, the leaves are applause
The trees sing in whispers, with the wind pulling their arms
Hold still, and listen, your hand on my heart
If you need them, these beacons will lead you back to the start
Yup
No ax has seen these woods since before your father stood
The path is beaten good from the feet of all who wandered through it
Old growth, holds hope, let the brambles scrape your skin
Scars are storybooks, the blood will wash away your sins
Now let that sun slip, then let that moon rise
Follow in no footsteps, listen for the true guides
Woods will play tricks upon pretty blue eyes
Is that glimmer the river, or your village finally brought back to life?

[Bridge]
Follow me tonight, I'll show you what's it like
To be alive

[Hook]
I know it seems like we're all lost, we see the secrets, we know the unknown
Know the unknown
Know the unknown
Keep close, hold my hand now, just be strong
We can follow this river right back to your home
Back to your home
Back to your home

[Verse 2]
At the palace in Versailles, 400 years before this
They are packing up supplies, preparing for a long trip
That they may not survive, but many of them know this
They would rather die, than to leave the question open
So this is why we try? We bet it all on hopeless?
And swim against the tide till until our every bone is broken
A sinking ship is still a ship, no captain has spoke the obit
Till the crew is flew, crow's nest slips silent beneath the ocean
We set sail without an anchor, we count upon that never stop
An anchor's just a coffin nail, waiting for that hammer drop
It holds you by the ankles till it pulls you to the Acheron
Trade stable to be able to slip out from under devil's thumb
Keep your anchor, my home is where my hat is hung
Postcard printed paper, and love notes from the lattice rungs
Blessed are the vagrant, the lonely are the static ones
It's every drifter's confirmation this world is just ravishing

[Hook]
I know it seems like we're all lost, we can follow this river back home
River back home
River back home
I know it seems like we're all lost, we see the secrets, we know the unknown
Know the unknown
Know the unknown
Keep close, hold my hand now, just be strong
We can follow this river right back to your home
Back to your home
Back to your home
I know it seems like we're all lost, we see the secrets, we know the unknown
Know the unknown
Know the unknown
