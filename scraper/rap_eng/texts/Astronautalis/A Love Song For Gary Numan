I won't waste your time
With nuts and bolts and pens and dimes
I dream I'm color blind and lisp, can you
Hear them calling from Hammersmith
All the punk rock kids
In their beds dreamin' of hot licks, can you
Hear them calling you now, you know
This pretty tiger needs no electric friends
Alright
Alright
Maybe we could pull a heist together
Stay out late until our bones turn dim
Two sharks learnin how to swim
I could learn to be a man and better
A crap artist just knows the trick
Just the trick to steal the show
Right from under his friends
Let's go start a band
Name it something no one understands, we'll
Circumnavigate the globe
In a plane made up of aluminum cans
We can bust on out this place together
Hijack a jetplane and wave goodbye
They'll never forget you, but no one can catch you
Live the dreams of pirates, theives, smugglers and spies, alright
I thought I had control, you know
The devil never needs I told you so's
You're always somewhere halfway home
It's funny how our hands seem so damn close
I thought I had control, you know
The devil never needs I told you so's
You're always somewhere halfway home
It's funny how our hands seem so damn close
I thought I had control, you know
I thought I had control, you know
I thought I had control, you know
The devil never needs I told you so's
