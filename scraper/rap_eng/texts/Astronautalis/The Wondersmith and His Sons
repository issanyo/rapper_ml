[Verse 1: astronautalis]
I am a soldier baby
Who works just like a slave
Sweating through the pain of digging his foxhole that he know is just a grave
You trust me don't you baby?
You'd hand your life to me
Let's walk along the wire and watch the muzzles flash like lightning

[Hook 1]
A smile safe-crackers understand, is rendering this steady hand obsolete
You thought you caught my slight of hand, but you could never understand
No not me

[Verse 2:astronautalis]
Father was a charming man with much hidden up his sleeve
I wonder if this is what he planned when he taught his tricks to me
The youngest was a clever boy cracking calculus by three
The eldest was a practical and obsessively clean
Then there was me:

I was born a charming man with silver tongue, pearl teeth
This's never how it's 'sposed to end, we're promised all we dreamed
The envy of the Everyman our family seemed complete
Our father was a charming man, our mother a serene

But now I'm on the run again - this hotel's home to me
They found the other skeleton face down in the stream
The youngest was still tucked in bed
That way they thought he was asleep
They moved the mirror from his mouth
The fog that should remain was not to be seen
Not to be seen

I am the doctor darling
Who used to operate
But I couldn't stand the pain of healing
Only t'watch another woman waste away
You trust me don't you baby?
Yeah you'd hand your life to me
Let's set this barn on fire
And watch the flames eat up the roof beams

[Hook 2]
A smile safe-crackers understand
Is rendering this steady hand
Obsolete
You thought I must have broken in
But there's no crime in coming in
They hand me the key

[Verse 3: astronautilis]
Floating on the wind again
On the tail of my quarry
On a woman weak for charming men
Who's holding what I need
She'll leave her window cracked for me
And I'll draft in like the breeze
My father was a charming man and I learned it all from he

The brother's born a wondersmith
We started as a team
Like complimenting cogs and gears we built a head of steam
The tragic flaw of charming men
Is exactly as it seems
Too much grease
Can break down a machine

Pour another round on me
Pour another round on me
You know I'm good for it
You know me
You know I'm good for it
You know my family

I am a lover lady
Who sees just what you dream
I know you're going crazy living with him an' without me
You trust me don't you baby?
Yeah you'd hand your life to me
Let's leave this life tonight
And race the sunrise down the highway

[Hook 3]
A smile safe-crackers understand
Is rendering this steady hand
Obsolete
The charm and confidence of men
Can jam the bullets in your gun
And stop heartbeats
