Baby tell me anything that you please
I'll take it all with a grain of salt
I know exactly why you're calling me
I don't even need to hear you talk
Daddy told me always watch my feet
When walking where the weeds grow too tall
And I can tell that you're lying to me
By the fork at the end of your tongue
The end of your tongue

I been up all night waiting for you to come home
Come up with a good reason
I been up all night knowing you gone and done wrong
I know you're lying cause you're speaking
Go on keep on praying to your god above
He knows the devil when he sees him
He only putting bills in your ol' swear jar
He won't buy you no freedom

Careful brother the grass grows awful high here
Ain't no telling what's dwelling or hides near
The formal felon don't always appear in Nike Airs
With right eye that might cry only tattoo tears
Nah, real killers don't kick down doors
The dangerous ones are ones you invite in your own home
So while you busy bolting and chaining
Turn around clown, in a nightgown the serpent is waiting
She got you in a death hold that won't let go
And you're quick to thank her
A stiletto ain't just a shoe but a knife that is dangerous
But I bet you you just slow
And you think you can change her
But a snake is still a snake even if it sheds its skin daily

I know you listening lady
Yeah you been keeping tabs on me lately
Crawled out your rock the moment I made it
With apologetic talk, Obama promising changes

I been up all night waiting for you to come home
Come up with a good reason
I been up all night knowing you gone and done wrong
I know you're lying cause you're speaking
Go on keep on praying to your god above
He knows the devil when he sees him
He only putting bills in your ol' swear jar
He won't buy you no freedom
