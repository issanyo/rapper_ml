(Jodeci)
I see ya movin baby yeah
And you're lookin good, said you're lookin fine
Everything's gonna be alright, yeah
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Whoa, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Father break it down

(Father MC)
Well I begin the weekend with a groove
Roll about eight deep now what's my next move
Waitin to nightfall so I can enjoy
System pumped by four Jeeps, runnin like a convoy
Roll to the park, kinda crowded, what a scene
Pullin up with Jodeci blastin out the fifteen
So I park my ride, girls see my gearin
Notice my grill that cause the pointin' and starin

(Chorus-Jodeci)
Everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
Ooh, everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight

(Father MC)
Now I sign a couple autographs, take a few flicks
Order Don Perionne and lay back with my chicks
Michael's on the left of me, Smooth is flippin
Tricky on my way on to the dance floor rippin
Trick is for the cutie, the key I'm tryna' find her
Tim is in the front and Mobat is right behind him
And me, I'm just layin on the prowl
Got' say what's up as the girls cry out
She grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him
My only thought, was to step to the A-M
Cause I came to have a good time
And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine
Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain, if you know what I mean
Understand I'm not conceeded, Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth-talk Romeo, freak kinda fellow

(Chorus)

(Father MC)
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) Do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out
Do that dance, do that dance, baby
Do that dance, let's work it out
(Both) I said do that dance, do that dance, baby
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out

(Father MC)
Loungin on the DL, this type of night is rare
I glanced to the right, oh who do we have here
Puffin Sweet, gettin ripped, what the hell
I see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell
Conversatin with his boys
I say stop and barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mellow so I leap
To the center where the soul's rollin five deep
Mark Currey, Aaron Sorkin and LQ
Doin the wild thing cause the soul is true
And everytime I see bodies gettin biz'
Girls are gettin wild cause Father's known for his
And everytime ya hear the music thumpity-thump
And all the girls gettin bumped right in ya rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor tonight

(Chorus) 2x

(Jodeci)
Everybody dance with me, ohh yeah
Everybody move with me, everybody
Everybody dance with me
Everybody move with me
Everything's gonna be alright
Let the music take control of your body tonight
