Yeah, Father MC at ya
This time I need somebody to give me what I want
And what I want is your affection

	[Unknown Female Singer]
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)

Now it's a pain to my remy cos I need someone true
My guard is down so baby come to my rescue
And show me that you wanna love me for who I am
See we could be flam and I can even meet your fam
I'm not an everyday but anyway I'll parlay
And I give good love almost everyday except for Sunday
That's my rest day, I'm getting ready for the Monday
So give me your affection

Now baby, baby, baby or miss, miss, miss
Can I get a ? because I didn't disrespect
I use my intellect when I hit rock bottom
I look at your legs and say hey sugar you got 'em
The way that you're walkin is buggin me hey love
Look at me, eye to eye, let us get a contact
Do I have to play the back just because you're off that
I wanna show you that I feel good
And let me give you a taste of my man hood
You see I'm bleedin inside on the loss of the effect
Do I have to sweat you to get you my ?
Cos I'm not into sweatin so I guess that I'm gone
If you knew what you were missing you would beg to be on
Cos I'm the type of brother that's a typical type
Don't believe in hype but I believe in love at first sight
So be my fantasy, lover and flavor of affection

Baby please no rejection (all I need)

All I want is a little ?
All I want is you
All I want is a little ?
All I want is you
