[Verse 1]
There's this feeling, I've been chasing
I've got leads on, its location
It changes form, every time I face it
Only appreciated when it's gone
Taken for granted like it’s etched in stone
But liberty ain't strong, any wrong break it
Placed in my arms, my control in cages
'Tween a rock and a hard place and they say move on
That's what I'm trying to do, a miracle to perform
But you can't make that without an eyebrow raising
People want your magic for their own ovation
When you're in full bloom is when the beehive swarms
And the time I've wasted, trying to fit in norms
People like me more when I pretend I'm basic
But what do I want, I practiced patience
And right then and there it dawned

[Chorus]
I just want to be happy
I just want to be free
I just want to be left alone
I just want to be me

[Verse 2]
What in the world are you looking for
Can't a young man get money on tour?
Live in Brooklyn buildings, pre-war
With a name that don't make you think of C4
High-ceiling apartments
No ceiling on my living, I ain't giving up options
Love without a limit is the mission accomplished
Don't expect to get it without wetting of armpits
I sweat these pores
In this American scheme, a picket sign to a fence
They want to kick me out the country as a line of defense
See me, I'm from the country and I'm proud of my ends
And even though you try to shun me, you ain't shrouding intent
I’m just a man with a vision in a tunnel with hit-men
Trying to shoot the lightbulb because they thought I was twitching
Got a few ideas, wrote them down in a list
Let me say them now before I forget them

[Chorus]
I just want to be happy
I just want to be free
I just want to be left alone
I just want to be me

[Verse 3]
I don't believe in a promise
Unless it's one I made myself
'Cause there is no denying the facts, if I'm the only accomplice
And rarely have I courted for help
I ain't trying to monstrous
I just want month's rent
A little something extra, I ain't hoarding the wealth
'Cause 99 percent of us is trying to get success
That 99 percent of us was already dealt
No trophy on the mantle but I got a mantle
When mama couldn't pay the power, I would grab the candles
I'm just thankful I can channel that to block a tangle
Steering straight and I don't hesitate to park an angle
I'm just trying to turn a smirk to a smile
Restricted to allow
All while keeping my distance from the crowd
And that may change along the road I pave
But today right here and now

[Chorus]
I just want to be happy
I just want to be free
I just want to be left alone
I just want to me
I just want to be happy
I just want to be free
I just want to be left alone
I just want to me
