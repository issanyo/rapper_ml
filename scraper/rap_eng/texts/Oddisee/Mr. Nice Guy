[Intro : Kenn Starr]
They say that nice guys always end up finishin' last
You can take a minute and laugh i admit it's a fact
Because i can vouch and attest to that
There's two different sides to every story this is just the facts

[Verse 1 : Kenn Starr]
Too many times they mistake kindness for weakness
Too many times others blind and couldn't see this
Figured it out couldn't believe that the way that i treat 'em
Is the reason i've been gettin' negative feedback
And i don't need that especially since
I ain't frontin' like i'm a pimp in a desperate attempt
Of impressin' my friends or validatin' my manhood
I guess i don't treat them as good as another man could
You know the type of dude that go out of his way
To neglect or disrespect call you out of your name
Treat you like a piece of meat have you life on a leash
Basically a nigga nicer than me? ho he having ya
With the type would like to choke or slap you up
Actin' tough till you pack it up cuz you had enough
Now you callin' me crying on my shoulders
Knowin' where you supposed to be
Cuz i told ya


[Hook : (Wayna)/Kenn Starr]
(just keep on searching)
Now i know what you're searchin' for
(tired of hurting)
Feelin' like i deserve more
(certain to come first)
Can you argue with these white lies?
(mr nice guy)
Its what i get for bein' a nice guy

(just keep on searching)
Now i know what you're searchin' for
(tired of hurting)
Feelin' like i deserve more
(certain to come first...)
Can you argue with these white lies?
Its what i get for bein' a nice guy


[Verse 2 : Kenn Starr]
My status ain't hood and a nigga ain't street
But i still hold you down ain't like a nigga sweet
For me its kinda bug i don't get it shorty want a thug
But she don't want everything that go along wit' it
Gettin' long winded yea i'm kinda relaxed though
But don't mistake that for me lackin' a backbone
Thinkin' you all that treating me like a doormat
Forced to reorganize my thoughts and fall back then
Develop a new game plan and strategy rapidly
Became a changed man and now you mad at me, why?
I'm just adaptin' to your previous actions
Rather leave it alone then get heated and have hits
Cuz i'm not meetin' your standards and criteria
I feel like you been taking advantage so why should i jus'
Sit around and take it i never appreciate it
Introducin' complainin' if i don't intend to change it


[Hook : Wayna/Kenn Starr]

So now i'm at a point where my attitude changed up
Things i criticize now i'm doin' the same stuff
Feelin' like a hypocrite cuz i went a different route
Tryin' to figure out if my intention is legitimate
Leadin' girls on and leavin' they worlds torn
Spit game work like a charm it became the norm
And i became the opposite of the name of the song
Let them all think whatever they want playing along
But i'm big enough to say that i'm wrong its too late
Cuz i'd of became the same type of kinda nigga i hate
The type of nigga that's fake not being true to myself
And changed due to the anger towards you that i felt
Lettin' my past dictate the decisions i make
But it wouldn't be fair to say that you made me this way
So maybe i can't place all the blame on you
Change my views my days playin' games is through

[Hook : Wayna/Kenn Starr]
