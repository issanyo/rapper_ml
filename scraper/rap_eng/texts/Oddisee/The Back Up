[Verse 1 - Oddisee]
Soon as I start
I partition the dough
Share life living it up
Before I jump off the edge I'mma visit the top
Build a block foundation I'm embracing the drop
Make or break it ain't the plot when you're switching your crop
If one egg start to rot, it won't diminish the lot
This is pops talking through me, with the bread he was smart
I took a sharp way of thinking, and I made it a dart
Point the weapon at myself, and I aim at the heart
Then at the brain, to make sure the logic was locked
Permanent stain, bloats on the cut of the cloth
The [?], I ain't done I'm forever the spark
From the start, I'm prepared for the fame, or the flop
Flame of the frost, the lost, all the gain that I got
They can rate I won't stop, in my action stance
A black man with a back up plan
While always saying, I'mma

[Chorus] x8
Back it up(Easy back it up)

[Verse 2 - Uptown XO]
Where did you go? Area code bury your soul
Do as you do ways of the fool save me the loan
Ain't mean it though, [?] saving for God
Word is your bond, you was my dog
But lately I'm all teeth, uh
Half of you gone, out of my life, peace
I get [?]- I don't answer before the beep
Ain't no get backs, quit that
You got up out your sit
Niggas was blowing, my bitch said, "Told you listen to me"
Now that you gone, hope you strong
Nigga your soul's cheap, spirit is weak
I pray that one day we can all see
There is a road, good for the soul, fuck what you stole
Uptown that's my humble abode
[?]
Motherfucker which one are you on
Gassing up, you nigga's mileage ain't adding up
You had it up, but I've had enough
I got my balls and my word

[Chorus] x8

[Verse 3 - yU]
Now look at that, what if I took it back
When I was riding 'round the city with this pretty youngin' that was
Thicker than a snicker, brother couldn't pass all that
Had to holla, now baby doll all up in my Cadillac
Now to long before she said her name the same as my mama
When I ask if she have man, she paused: I ain't want no drama
So I told her: Hol' up, I know the feeling I like the brain
But if you ain't single I ain't down with recycling
The old me would have said, "Fuck all that"
When you do things, they boomerang, and find their way on back
It wasn't easy, 'specially she had her hand on my lap
One eye scoping out the gap in her thigh, had them tatts
And that's why
I went as far as I did
Pulled over, right hand shoulder, then she got closer I told her
I'd take her home, kind of awkward 'cuz I tend to be brief
I dropped her off on Kennedy, and got back crackin' this beat
And it went

[Chorus]
