[Hook]
Matrimony with the money, and we never go our separate ways
Dressed like rappers homie, what that mean
Iridescent everything, I glo up every day
Oh man, I glo up every day
Like I know some folks be bangin' mane they throw up every day
Like I know some folks be drankin' mane they throw up every day
Get throwed mane but don't you throw your life away
I glo up every day

[Verse 1]
I was sitting languid reading Steinbeck in the library
And word got back to me my old plug just got locked up for strong arm robbery
I got a glimpse of his temperament, so maybe he's innocent
Or maybe he did this shit, I guess you gotta do whatever you gotta do
To get by in this economy, but I couldn't comment
Cause I didn't come up in that ecology where they move rocks like geology
And steel just like Carnegie, when you get out get a job
Cop a car and get some property, that drop top monopoly
The officer that put the cuffs on you, I never could trust, I'm ready to bust
On anybody like that man, cause the black man strong for him is hard to see
Before my casket drops, my task is to stop the task force
And have these crooked cops cookin' up in the butcher shop
Your cranium I aim straight for it, straightforward with my thoughts
Man I don't beat around the bush a lot, it's time I tell folks 'bout COINTELPRO
The government undercutted the front runners, undercover strums make sure
You don't see another summer, incentives got big sisters snitchin' on younger brothers
White boy, college educated parents, rapping ain't the average career path
I fear that in my darkest hour I'll call and won't even hear back
But if you ain't got something decent to say, just keep my name out your mouth
And I gon' keep it the same' moving up like the Butler
I make them Cecil gains, you feel me mane?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just kicked it with my homie, but it feel like the vibe ain't there
I just kicked it with my homie, but it feel like the vibe ain't there
We used to chop game 'bout every topic, it was so calmin'
Now the only thing we got in common is the wasted time we share
And what's on my mind, all that time I never shared
My closet confidant went hardcore conservative, damn man life ain't fair
Look I'm far from my best, your best bet is that you best learn it
You ain't been through what  I been through, you don't get me I get it don't get nervous
On the low I blew checks on some Lo very fye like blue checks
And my next purchase elegant like French cursive, I put your
Albums, tapes and guest verses in a stretched out procession of stretch hearses
Remember the pancake breakfast with the gluten free tastin' awful?
The scrambled eggs and Eggo waffles? Legos was out thing
You was set with the sets now you set with the set
Had a home full of RCs, now all of my homies off of RCs
But the acid tabs and phenethylamines was never meant for me
The alcoholic tendencies put intestines up in jeopardy, I seen family feuds
Go down over a gram or two, it's testing me like Jeopardy
It went from Matchbox to boxes of matches, to boxing matches out back on the trampoline
To boxing and matching, pints of lean and fifths of Henessey

[Outro]
Oh man I glo up every day
