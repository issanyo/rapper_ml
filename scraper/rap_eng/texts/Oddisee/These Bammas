[Verse 1 - Oddisee]
Oh you think you doing something?
Foolish assumption you ain't doing nothing
Grinding be taking  all of my time up, you consumed by nothing
Niggas thirsty claiming they hustling but hungry they wasn't

[Verse 2 - Uptown XO]
Young and discovered That's what we wanted, was shoved in our stomach
Luggage emotional and the baggage brought tears to my mother
Finding yourself, now you know that it takes years to discover
But only the strong be the ones not compared to the others

[Verse 3 - yU]
I love em' but hate em', they don't say no
Ain't trying to make no waves so
Showing us how the motherfucking days go
Slaves with invisible chains for minimum wage
We all in the same boat
We can't grow with faith flow
Your angle's the difference between making do or that can't dough

[Verse 4 - Uptown XO]
We be the best three
Yes we, check please
This is deadly, your favorite rapper's pet peeve
Hard to impress me, 38 talking 17
Like a fresh tee, see our profits increase

[Verse 5 - yU]
And you stay trying, buying lavish things that matter mo
Trends go in and out, forgot about like it was vaginal
Damnit change the standard, same pattern, it don't even matter mind frame
I switch up the picture, then situate it, be sideways

[Verse 6 - Oddisee]
I'm dealing with an industry that's afraid of some real talent
Shall I cater to niggas and try to deliver balance
See me riding Caprices, or trade it in for a Prius
Be balling Monday through Friday, y'all own the club on the weekends

[Verse 7 - Uptown XO]
What's all of that you arguing
And go through the catalog and
You can tell that we write raps like we some tattoo artist
This is our corner homes, don't let me catch you on it
Catastrophe, it's a wrap for any who opposes

[Verse 8 - Oddisee]
My door ain't always open, could catch me before the closing
Knock on this opportunity door but you never go in
Cause if you ain't in motion already I leave you frozen
New niggas really wait to be chosen
What the fuck

[Chorus] x2
What's up with these Bammas?
I don't even know?
Where they trying taking?
They ain't trying to go
Know what I'm saying
Not when you playing, slaying pm to am
The three of them keep ya speakers on blast that's where ever we at

[Verse 9 - yU]
Question! that is the lesson!
Yes indeed we do get busier
Too many trendy wanting it all ain't putting in any work
The flimsy verse done made the beat disappointed
You flamboyant with hands pointing, really you should destroy that, annoying

[Verse 10 - Uptown XO]
It's about to get ugly, and pretty aggressive, and really competitive
You see the president, isn't a resident, inside of the city we represent
And see the city would be on if niggas were very determined
They come in and swing low, chariot gone, put the whole area on

[Verse 11 - Oddisee]
Man y'all don't know fly shit
All you do is buy shit
Y'all don't ever apply shit
All you do is ride it
Y'all don't do, or die shit
All you do is survive shit
That's bare minimum, anyway keep it going

[Verse 12 - yU]
Now it just may be the way of thee whole planet I guess
But seems like y'all may just may be cool simply not reaching your best
But see now we three are not got plots to be in knee reach
Higher, speak fire, for any tryna, we never stop

[Chorus] x2
