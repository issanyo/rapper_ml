I get it

[Verse 1: Shad]
Maybe I'm not big because I don't blog or Twitter
Dawg, I'm bitter
I didn't happen on the flop, but I'll win it on the river
Longest winter got me seasoned, now I'm a non-beginner
Meaning not yet a veteran but nevertheless
Pick the drug or the rapper man, I'm better than Meth
Dope as Ether, either the drug or the Jay diss
I would say dope as reefer but that would be too basic
And overplayed, overslaved, won't complain though
The game's been good to a youngin' out of London so I'm grateful
Not just for the funding or for the fans
But for the chance to say something, it wasn't in the plans at first
It was sad days, halfway to graduation
Cap and black cape, making job applications
I hate the catchphrase "Canadian rap sensation"
Shad K don't have chains, big as the Appalachians
But since the label put me out like ashtrays to smoke cats
I have gained some accolades and admiration
It's grown since then though that second album man was so old-school
Folks called it old Princeton
I'm still penny-pinching though it sold fine
Billfold gon' hold still as pigskin when it's field goal time, now
That being said it's still '09
And I still got a lot of credit I still owe 9
But they charge no interest, so I pay no interest
Meaning I pay no mind, If there ain't no fine, I'm fine
I hope I ain't boring y'all rapping bout rap
But the only thing I love more than rapping is napping
And I know nobody want to hear me rap about that
You want the underdog spazzing on the track

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shad]
Well my name ain't Lil Wayne Gretzky
But y'all know better than to check me
In the game, I hold records like a Technic
Telling referees to peek at the press seats a sec please
Drop your gloves OJ, haha
I knock you into next week make you get teeth replaced
Can't use plates what you get to eat
Gives new meaning to tube steak
Like watching you breast feed Doomsday
Move on these squares like a chesspiece, I'm deadly
Even if you're Supernatural, I'm Craig G
Jesse James meets Jet Li, killing these fakes at break neck speed
I make your head steam like a pet peeve
Get your neck squeezed till the breath leaves
Got the finesse and the prestige
And more mack than 10 tech geeks dissing XP
Best in the league of vets like ex-marines
Highest pedigree, when I get the beat it's heredity
Genetic freak poetically
One-ten degree Memphis heat spitting steadily
Medically decapitate this rapper's face, still won't get ahead of me
I'm the best I'll ever be (Yeah!)
The cats out the bag, the new Shad's out
Now they spell it S.H.A.D.D. the way I spazz out
I don't bad mouth but I'll quickly
Put down the cat if he bit me like Roy's boy Siegfried
Welcome to the big leagues where they pitch heat
Still on a hit streak, my rapping's like batting .360
Hey Griffey, slow down, do something less cerebral
I ain't big enough yet
I gotta keep impressing people
I get it, guess it's a lesser evil, weapon's lethal as a Desert Eagle
Now my lethal weapon won, you don't get a sequel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shad]
No eviction notice still I'm homeless on a poet's mission
Not that I'm a fiend stealing bass like Otis Nixon
Living on the street now I'm living on the road consistent
Making fans multiply like a coefficient
Record sales, I'm making low comission but the vision's mine
They don't change my record like pitching a no decision
Guitar playing emcee, yeah I'm known for spitting
While I'm tapping on my fender like cars in a slow collision
The precision of my flows in terms of tone and diction
Is akin to that of the old masters of prose and fiction
So many sold their souls, my sole ambition's
To hold solace so calm and bright as a solar system
I'm from a soul tradition, heads think I'm going to prison
Cause I'm talking bout this rap sheet with the most conviction
The most commitment, no other pro is so proficient
The coldest spitting, Rakim north pole edition
Listen
