Barefoot running on the blacktop, middle of the summer
Searchin’ for the first sign of comfort
Burdened by the path that I covered
Perseverance, feelin like I’m Barefoot runnin on the blacktop, middle of the summer
Searchin’ for the first sign of comfort
To make the pain numb, can’t wait ‘til that day come, I’ll be like

Fought against my inner demons/
Inhibitions and restrictions had consistently impeded/
Any shift in my indifferent disposition towards cohesive/
Beneficial intimate relationships with other people/
Showed no interest, content as a hermit, cuz it’s convenient/
The less distance that I’m given at my whim, the more uneasy/
That I get, ‘cuz I’m convinced you’ll unintentionally misread me/
At events, I would pretend that I was friendly, it’s deceiving/
Don’t suspend this apprehension, it’ll eventually defeat me/
Social anxiety/
Seen as a pariah, I was hopeless in society/
Best move was seclusion/
Reclusive, less humans/
Circle of friends was exclusive/
In retrospect, I was stupid/
Evolution ain’t impossible/
I finally learned my message: “push the envelope”/
Company’s discomforting but conditioning’s needed to evolve/
Gotta keep on, gotta keep on/

[RoQy TyRaiD]
Ridin’ bald tires to the wire, lost my electricity/
Job supervisor got her eye on ethnicities/
No sympathy/
If your health declines, don’t arrive and you’re history/
Siphoned my energy, deprived of my time, had to hide my identity/
Ironically, I got it to provide my amenity/
Pay my rent in time without fine or penalty/
But Over The Horizon, is victory/
Deskjob got a brotha distraught/
No rest or fresh start, duress and stress caused/
From expensive investments/
To broke for Whole Foods, to rich for Quest Cards. Welp!/
To admit, I considered quittin’ to finish school/
Do to manipulative friends with hidden agendas, who/
Viewed Jacob as a ladder to success/
My soul gets callous with each step. Feelin’ like I’m/
