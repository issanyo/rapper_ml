The nomads

[Hook: Mo Kheir]
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
Fly on my own right now
Nomad is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
I'm in the zone right now
Nomad is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I've gotta go right now
I've gotta go right now

[Verse 1: Mo Kheir]
Nomad's taking over
We are like the ronin
We land love and move on
Can't settle down [?]
If home is where the heart is
Then I've been living heartless
I lose, but never give up
I don't know where my mind is (yeah)
I even win when I lose
'cause if I fall down I come back like a ghost
And I think you feel me and don't need to touch
And only the realest can feel me the most
Got nothing to lose 'cause I change and I move a lot
Nomads are coming up, world is my home
Never not ready, I live in the zone
Zone is the world so I'm never alone

[Hook: Mo Kheir]
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
Fly on my own right now
Nomad is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
I'm in the zone right now
Nomad is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I've gotta go right now (gotta go right now)

[Bridge: Mo Kheir]
Like thunder in the storm
I was born for this shit
I'm always moving on
So no one visits
But I know something you don't know
I think that change is beautiful
Even if I was alone
I'd go where growin' takes me to

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
There's no place like home but when I home up
Reminiscing 'bout a place like Roma
See, I roam around the world like a military bag
Where you living, I could visit
But never kick it long enough to miss it
It's the very fact that I never get attached
The image too big for me to ever send it
I'm in the here and now
Only in the moment, you could witness
Man, I've seen so many places, so many faces
People didn't know me on a first name basis
When I've got a problem, [?'vin] in the [?-suggle]
With a quickness I'm reminded they were only an acquaintance
Soon another level, on another flight
Nomads never settle, roam another night
Life without a limit like I hadn't ever finished
Want everything basic, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Mo Kheir]
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
Fly on my own right now
No man is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna take off right now
Nothing 'gon slow me down
I'm in the zone right now
No man is roaming 'round
I better go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I'm gonna go right now
I've gotta go right now (gotta go right now)
