[Verse 1]
I am speaking from the privilege to waste
I have eaten not for hunger but for taste
My predicament has changed
Counting pennies to accounts amounting plenty
Spend it like it's never ending, never saved
I learned how to misbehave
Long before I learned my lesson
Slow forgetting, quick repeating, answer seekin'
Like Punjabis in the house
Burnt decisions came from instances of doubt
I mean, what this all about?
Friend to foe, foe to friend
And so it go
Evil or I got my hand out to extend
As for handouts I don't lend
I been there for lots of people
When they need you, they around
When time they equal, they depart
I take that straight to my heart
Contemplated thinking everyone's the same
But, in the end it only changes who you are
As for I, I will remain
I'm the summon of my past and my present
What's the combo
Make me run, I take my pleasure with my pain
Take some hurt to make a mark
Only difference from a stain is how you see it
I just work to turn my blemishes to art

[Chorus]
If you never had a dream you thought would happen start collapsin'
And your passion keep you building, why you crackin'
Well my friend, you'd never live
Well my friend, you'd never live
If you never loved somebody and with time you start to hate them
Then with time you realise you can't replace them
Well my friend, you'd never live
Well my friend, you'd never live

[Verse 2]
I remember when I first felt that feeling of rejection
I was waiting on an answer, she was out of the question
Then I bagged another batter that's ain't out of my league
She came out of that retirement to bat
Best believe, people social
I was hopeful based on nothing but my vocals, what's a crutch
Break a leg, wish me luck, yes indeed
I took knocks to confidence to build this monument to dreams
Now I laugh at the path I thought I never would achieve
'Cause now all I do is travel when I never thought I'd leave
It's a trip, left my past, bag is checked, and extra bags
Manifested we'll fly and we collab
Everyday I count my blessings
Stressed, I don't forget to add
Though, I tried, I learned
I can't just take the good without the bad
Simple math and next fall I won't ignore and skip a class
And attendance with remembrance, I might end this as a grad
At the top I won't forget all of the drop kids took to pass
Life ain't perfect, but it's worth it
I don't have to check the tag
Fill my bag

[Chorus]
If you never had a dream you thought would happen start collapsin'
And your passion keep you building, why you crackin'
Well my friend, you'd never live
Well my friend, you'd never live
If you never loved somebody and with time you start to hate them
Then with time you realise you can't replace them
Well my friend, you'd never live
Well my friend, you'd never live

[Verse 3]
I tend to walk with angels
Stroll through that park with demons
Hand in my pocket in case they clocking they won't stop my angle
They try to throw that shade though
That's okay I go with raincoats
Over my head no halo
But over ahead that rainbow
I can't complain though
I got DrƒÅno for my pipe dreams
Strike that, water under bridge with lightning
It won't fright me
I just lay low
Come back with something fatal
Kill mo' I just alter angles
Life try to spite me and despite I still invite that fighting
Stay in the rain for the good bout
Team on deck that's a lookout
Share my meal that's a cookout
Any man try to block way got took out
Got clearway from the hearsay
I don't hear talk 'til a year late
And by then don't matter, what's chatter in the wind forecast on a clear day
I just want to keep my focus
Sleep knowing that I won't blow this
Yeah I got doubts but I know this'll always pull through when defeat get closest
I just want to roll with the punches
Want to pose and poke holes in my lungs and
If you can't accept it and forgive
Well my friend you'd never live
