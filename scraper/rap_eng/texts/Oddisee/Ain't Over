[Breakdown x8]
Aw, baby, now let's get down tonight

Aw, baby, now

[Verse 1 -Uptown XO]
It don't stop, uh, it don't quit, uh
Put 'em up under the flame with this old shit, uh
Given the game that we got from the poor pimps
Now minimum wage wouldn't stop me from rocking with your bitch, uh
Keep her coming, uh, keep her coming, uh
Came when she came over, easy does it, uh
Strapped up, my homie got one in the oven, uh
Taxed up, and they leaving you in public
You ain't wifey material, we ain't fucking
Now you all up on the floor, it ain't up for discussing, uh
Name calling, uh, loud cussing, uh
I can't call it, uh, I'm loud puffing, uh
Thinking of the days I was picking up the pace
Stuck in that pop-pop, age in the cage, had to change up my ways
But here's a question for you
Is a bond got the success questionable?
Yes, or a no

[Hook - XO]
This ain't over
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
This ain't over, over, over, over
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
This ain't over
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
This ain't over, over, over, over
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
(Keep it coming, uh, keep it coming, uh)
This ain't over

[Verse 2 - Oddisee]
My story started, before my heart did
Before my father departed the land of the profit
And ran into my mother in a party in the land of the projects
I come from a long line of time dodgers, fate changers
And they seem stranger than fiction, not danger
That I'm in the middle of like Rodney and Field
I've yet to feel something truly different in His will
And keep spinning, keep spinning, uh
Keep spinning, maybe I'll surprise myself with a, uh, deep ending
My day to day amazing, to me it's a routine
When you sign up for a spaceship? I need me a new scene
Need me a new zone where comfort gets repelled
A brother got his story to tell
Even though I'm in the part of the plot that's as thick as a jail
The hell raisers still yet to be filmed, singing

[Hook ]

[Verse 3 - yU]
Let me tell you something, why I ain't never running
I'm all about the things I've done which I really did nothing yet
I knew a cat who was so high on himself
His favorite letter was "I" and after time would go by
Nobody wanted to be around him, got no pound nor a hi
He would blame it on they hating on him, that wasn't why
It's more like more than your life, a world outside of you
He asked me, I told him look from a wider view
He paused and thought like "Ah, dog, my fault
I was probably an asshole after I got the cash flow"
You my man so I got to let your ass know
'Cuz a closed mind meaning that you can't grow
We know some but still got room for much more
Kind of things that make you question what you doing this for
Keep it moving like the music got the groove going on-on-on
Flowing like life is gone because


[Hook ]
