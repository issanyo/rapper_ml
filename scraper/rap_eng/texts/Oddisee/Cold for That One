[Intro: Trek Life]
Uhh... yeah yeah
Uhh... cmon
Yo... Uhh

[Verse 1: Trek Life]
I keep a tale of loss and prevail
See many men will try but most men will fail
To get this pretty cat with motor in her tail
She drove nice cars and boats she would sail
Yacht trips and stock tips, she got this
See, she ain't even bothered unless it's 'bout chips
Not talkin' new money, but that old money rich
A bangin'-ass body with them gold-getter lips, and-ah
You won't catch her up in V.I.P.;
You won't catch her at your job as a secretary
She ? at the bars and tryin' break a ?
He wanna break it down, not knowin' what's the cause
The late night sweats and soon the wife gon' know
What really did happen on nights home alone
She get the tape and scream harassment, attorney settled n' cashin'
Damn she cold for that one

[Hook: Trek Life]
So cold (so cold), so cold (so cold)
That's cold (that's cold), that's cold (that's cold)
So cold (so cold), she cold (she cold)
That's cold (that's cold), cold world (cold world)

That's cold (so cold), so cold (so cold)
You cold (she cold), she cold (that's cold)
That's cold (so cold), so cold (so cold)
So cold (so cold), cold world (cold world)

[Verse 2: Trek Life]
I keep a tale of money, sex, and greed
This girl is at the crib, not gettin' what she need
He gettin' that paper and he buying nice things
But time is of the essence and the grind brings lessons
Cuz while he on the clock, his homeboy'll leave a message on his cellphone talkin' 'bout how he neglected
A snake nigga, who always thought he was better
So he covered in his car, his wife house in cheddar
But always shook his hand like "We in this shit together."
So when things got strange, you thought ? would never
The late night sweats and soon ol' boy finna know
What really did happen while he was at work gone
He get home, put the key in the door
Not ready for the shock in which he was in store
The worst thing he could've imagined, his boy hittin' it from the back
Damn you cold for that one

[Hook: Trek Life]

[Verse 3: Trek Life]
I keep a tale of joy turned to pain
He worked on a job that stressed him insane
He still worked hard and never once complained
So the boss slacked off and took all accolades
Promotions, the bonuses, you know the biz
But never once mentioned what his best worker did
His feet up on the table, he sat back and chilled
If he ever caught heat, ? could roll downhill
But either way, his best worker got his
So the unemployment rate got him stuck where he is
Cuz he don't wanna make no waves
So he say "okay' and do the job with a smile on his face
The all day sweatin'; soon the worker gonna learn
The corporate world don't give a damn; he got burned
They laid him off to save some cash and the boss never got his back, but got a bonus
Now your the coldest
