[Hook: Maimouna Youssef]
I think I'm in a maze
I'm feeling conflicted within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this a phase
Or is this the way?

[Verse 1]
I wanna make nonstop profit
I wanna make it non-profit
Close down a store when I go shopping
Open up the floor for a closed topic
And relax on a beach in remote tropics
But grind like I'm broke and I'm so jobless
Feeling like it's me against the world- It's the other way around:
We polluting and we won't stop it
I wanna stay at home and play Xbox
But my homies keep on hitting up my inbox
Say it's been a long time since they seen me
So I'm cutting off the T.V and I meet em at the next spot
I think I want a job in an office
I am the epitome of what a boss is
A paycheck every two weeks
Over losing out on sleep for the fear that I go starving
And yet I wanna take more risk
I don't wanna take more losses
Wanna be a better spender but I like the idea of not caring what the cost is
I wanna tell the truth even when it hurts, but when I get it back I'd rather have the blow softened
Wanna pray 5 times a day, am I heading to the mosque?
Prolly not, I don't go often
In the kitchen cooking dinner yeah I made that
Feelin' lazy so I'll prolly order takeout
Better yet I'm really fiending for some Shake Shack
Lookin at the plate like I gotta keep my weight down
In a circle of self worth and judgment
How you match it up gets puzzling
How to know enough is enough when your lust for a much of enough it feels just as real as a something

I think I'm in a maze
I'm feeling conflicted within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this a phase
Or is this the way?
I think I'm in a maze
I'm feeling conflicted within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this a phase
Or is this the way?

[Verse 2]
I pretend that I listen a lot when people say things I don't really care about
In one ear and it goes out
And you wouldn't even notice that my head was in the cloud
But my inner voice really wanna shout
Quit crying you ain't dying
But I reply with legitimate advice like
"Keep trying they hiring"
But I really wanna tell them that they wasting time
More importantly they wasting mine
That's harsh and I'm not cold
Yeah I'm from the Capitol but I'm not bold
I guess I really am a nice guy
Keep hearing though that they don't win races
So I wanna be a track star
Laughing at the people tripping on they own laces
That's tasteless and I got style
And I ain't got wings but I got house
And that's why folks wanna pick my brain
I saw the big picture when I picked my frame
But I think most art's pretentious
Prolly just surrounded by the egocentric
And that rubbed off, so
I say things that go along with the grain like
Yeah I meant it

I think I'm in a maze
I'm feeling conflicted within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this a phase
Or is this the way?
I think I'm in a maze
I'm feeling conflicted within my brain
All these contradictions got me feeling strange
Is this a phase
Or is this the way?

I think I'm in a maze (in a maze)
I feel like conflicting with inner brain (yeaah)
All these contradictions got me feeling strange (feelin strange)
Is this a phase (Is this a phase)
Or is this the way? (Is this the way)
