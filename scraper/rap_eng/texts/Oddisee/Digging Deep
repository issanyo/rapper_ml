[Verse 1]
Short timing, I've been on this life thing, I've lived like kings
And the men who set aside all the nice things, searching for what life means
And all they found was peace in the pipe dream
Rights made wrong from a point of view
Morality is relevant to what you're going through
On a high, I'm a judge, on the low, I'm like, "Your honor
If you only knew the karma, you would light plea."
I feel sorry for the people that are probably hated
'Cause when you take the time to understand the makings of a man, you comprehend that he's the sum of circumstance
And that evil ain't incarnate & if cornered we can all create it
I know it's easy when you’re angry just to shallow grave it
But dig deeper for the reasons and we're all related
To kill a cousin ain't as easy as a stranger
And the danger ain't the bullet but the anger

[Chorus]
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)

[Verse 2]
Nothing happens overnight
Stop thinking you can make it if you copy what I'm doing right My mistakes ain't in the credits
But that's what should get it, failure fueled the drive like 87 unleaded
Never gassed up
I'ma stay the same
You could give me fame or could take away the last buck
Switching lanes ain't in the formula forget it
One me and that’s the person I'ma be until I'm debted
I ain't hear to tell you everything will be fine
'Cause thinking critically is really on a decline
Please read between the lines
For they cross us and we hang like free time
I'm on the incline
Steady growing like a garden, try to tend mine
And you go folding in the foliage of a forest, filled with fortune
In the form of something for us, that's a grape vine
Now you heard it

[Chorus]
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
So let’s get into it (deeper, deeper, deeper)
