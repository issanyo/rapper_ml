[Hook]
I Haven't been alive long but I've found
That all that we experienced has been around
All the highs and lows along the day-to-day
And nothing  [?]
So I go along with the waves though they might be so strong
It’s just a part of it all
It’s just a part of it all
It’s just a part of it all

[Verse 1 - Oddisee]
I find it hard at times to see the bigger picture
Designer things and little minor things
That make it hard at times to be the bigger person
In the time of blame
Shit ain’t perfect but I’m fine with things
You see the way they are is how they supposed to be
You know playing a part in the ways of art
And the reciting from Bach is the approach to me
Keep it classic bae no question man
Nobody asked you bae but keepin’ also me
Get attached to me from many actions
We had in passing, no you ain’t close to me
This a joke to me
People see the world as if they the sun
And we solar things
And if they would run the entire show
Around them we’re spun like a roller ring
Get a real perspective
Hit a couple back getting real selective
Had to double back on the misdirections
Got cool with some folks that I used to mess with
Now we don't click like a missed connection
Hard is the way that I’ve learned my lesson
And the cause wasn’t great but I’m still affected
By the losses I take but I did correct them in time
Hope things are here reflecting
I've done some things I can’t take back
The past is where they made me at
And where I’m now is part of how I’m facing facts
It get from the start to the finish
Everything up in between but we experience
Or simply just believe is a part of it all

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Uptown XO]
Yeah, told the niggas from beginning
It ain’t a muthafuckin’ givin’ take a second, take a minute
Now recollecting our condition
Competitive fighting for scraps money turn niggas wicked
A vision, we know who did it
Politic and dollar getting [?]
You see, niggas gotta get it
All on the mind, got on yo grind and pick up with the system
Don’t even listen when they talk sci-fis
Tell people that we up on a mission
And only from the district to the freedom fighters worldwide
What you done did is [?] ludicrous they livin’
Cuz you know I got the girls right by me starting who’s gonna finish?
Who’s gonna defend us? niggas getting sentenced lifetimes
All of the new slaves in the system, can they get a witness?
Part of a part of me apart of the pimp shit
Focused to coating all the devil’s intentions
Everything started from a dot in the system
So long, so far nobody [?]
But we not free though
OG when I roll my tree up chose three
Nigga turn that heat up
We the realest shit out your speaker
We the shit you see [?]
[?]
All of our leaders, from Jim Crow to "My Adidas"
Apart of me is saying that I got to beat this
I'm the spirit undefeated


[Hook]

[Verse 3 - yU]
Some things I’ve had, some I haven’t
Like two parents, no marriage, scattered fam, dysfunctional parents
Which matters when, you look at em' later
That’s what I’m made of, balance and chaos I be on point, sometimes I’m way off
Dedicated, but still need one day off
Far from perfect
On the surface I done did dirt that hurt others
Love is amongst us
But when you lose it it punctures
All of us (?)
Having fun when young before income was our main concern
The pages turn to the much later chapter
Still my bond is my worst word, swerve
What do we really deserve?
You get what you earn, more difficult live and you learn
How you get closer that fire, desired, with minimal burns?
That shit is your turn
Timing is like God synchronising that moment for us
We’re here with down later it may go
All those with no nuts may blow up from closer fall
Attention with no response, just know who you are
Cause the odds, they might just throw you off
Until you find yourself lost
So what you need to hear, you gotta be on yo frequency like
It's small but still it's a part of all on earth
Believe in yo life

[Hook]
