Been going through a lot lately
Looking toward the stars, and asking for God to save me
Thankful for the life he’s given though, it’s all gravy
Favored for sure, but the destiny’s a maybe
Huh
My destiny it may be
Locked behind the metal of the mic
I gotta say
Speak, life into the strains of this brain
I etch my soul into clean slates, and paint every stain
Everything I contain
I can’t just mask it
Putting beats into caskets
I’m waking up for my classes
But rather wake to make classics
And then just pass it, like a point guard
They asking how I got so nasty, I just point...
He’s the reason that I’m breathing
The seasoning in what’s cooking
Lace his light in my lines
Harness hope in every hook
Simply put
I’m just fishing for souls
Manifesting on my destiny
And mining my gold
But brother, trust me, I know
I keep in mind
After mining comes the refinement
Grateful for my time in college
To sharpen up my self-knowledge
I’m Daniel-San with the wax
Don’t leave a track until it’s shining
I’m Daniel, son with the pack
You’ll find me sleeping with lions
I’m telling you I ain’t lying
Something great soon come
But DJ Khaled ain’t got it
The major key is the Son
The beauty’s bursting through horizon
What’s soon to come is his arrival
But his rival knows that me and you are liable
If you called you to duty
In your load out, put your Bible
It’s so reliable
Never changing
Even when we ever flaking
He knows we be on some Frosted
Yet he still hung on the cross, kid
If infiltrating the game is my mission
I accept it
Like IMF
Imma cruise to the people ain’t expecting
These mumble rappers on the XXL is disrespectful
Cuz underground we got treasure that’s sadly been neglected
People patiently perfecting every syllable
Writing for a purpose: Accord the people
Umbilical
I got something’s I think I need to say
You gon’ deny me?
These wack rappers draining the game
I got the IV
