[Intro: Oddisee]
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started readin' somethin' and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet)  (Down, lookin' down, look around
Lookin' down, look around)
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started readin' somethin' and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet)  (Down, lookin' down, look around
Lookin' down, look around)

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I think I'm running out of things that anybody can tell me
Ain't too many dreams left to try to come sell me
Empty promises, no longer wasting my time
Concrete the answer, I don't mess with a frail thing
I read between the lines before the signature's signed
'Cause what you say and how you say can mean the shot or the shelvin'
Window shopping, no the topic ain't a retail thing
I'm talking about the spot between release and withheld things
Liberty is freedom with a slimmer design
Therefore a slave without a master is a victimless crime
Nobody ever told me not to leave my block
As long as I don't see the lock, I think I'm living outside
Your picket fences' fine until you pivot the line
And your indifference is stopped, by your existence confined
That moment of shock is what y'all call 'woke', well "Hello"

[Chorus: Oddiseee]
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started reading something and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet) Couldn't put it down (down), took a look around ('round)
And noticed time was moving faster when I'm lookin' down
(Lookin' down, look around)
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started reading something and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet) Couldn't put it down (down), took a look around ('round)
And noticed time was moving faster when I'm lookin' down
(Lookin' down, look around)

[Samples]
Love you more, love you more, love you more (more, more, more)
Love you more, love you more, love you more (more, more, more)

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
It's highly, unlikely anybody despite me could ever walk in my Nikes
Sort of more like hiking, fjord to fjord like a Viking
I set afoot the shore that take accord to my liking
I made a path for others to follow, they want a leader
Instead of the way to be the, master of their tomorrow
They got me on the job like immigrants
I do the jobs that they won't, not the ones that they didn't get
Been tourin' for four months, barely an off day
My show is calisthenics, gainin' pounds as I lost weight
I ain't seen Brooklyn since the trees ain't had leaves
I ain't seen Maryland since a bushel was mad steep
I ain't seen worry since I found how the man eats
I adopted the plan, let my friends think I'm mad cheap
And that wasn't last week, and this wasn't overnight
Ashamed when rapper's famous but don't know how to hold a mic (explain this)

[Chorus: Oddisee]
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started readin' somethin' and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet) Couldn't put it down (down), took a look around ('round)
And noticed time was moving faster when I'm looking down (lookin' down, look around)
Yesterday I stayed up when the sun set
Started readin' somethin' and I wasn't done yet (wasn't done yet) Couldn't put it down (down), took a look around ('round)
And noticed time was moving faster when I'm looking down (lookin' down, look around)
