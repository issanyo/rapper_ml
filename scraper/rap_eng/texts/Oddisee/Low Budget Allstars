[Verse 1: Kev Brown]
It’s real music so don’t get it confused with
Them other dudes you’ve heard, it’s all polluted
The true soldier’s here, you need to salute him
With no interruptions until the conclusion
My crew’s been slept on for some time now
Still here writing these rhymes down
Still scribbling out the racket, Wimbledon Ralph
Figuring out the next move, different amounts
Cash to make once you get past the fake
Later for them for under-estimating a gem
They don’t understand
Thank God for the fans that’s die hard
For y’all, can attest to that
The new stuff coming out, we the best of that
Years from now see where all the rest is at
I don’t kick dollar-bin raps, let it be known
It’s classics being crafted till I’m in the casket

[Verse 2: Kenn Starr]
It go one, two, three and to the four, five
Come through, we get it so live
For the speakers, a matter of fact
Over beats when I’m riding the track or when I’m talking to y’all
Squad up, whole arsenal raw
You washed up like Arsenio Hall
You not tough, stop putting thought into your bars
You not us, take it lost like a man, admit it, you got crushed
But since you kept running your lips it did not hush
Ended up like Mike did with them kids and you got touched
Ended up like Mike Vic in the pocket, you got rushed
And we went right quick in your pocket, you got stuck
Give it up, and just in case you planning to fight back
I play baseball with your face and a spiked bat
Avoid the buck fifty, you thinking we Jah Cool
That’s like Lloyd, Buck and Fifty singing for Ja Rule

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
Y’all fools for thinking we’re stopping, please
We’re making paper like we’re chopping trees
It’s hard labor like we’re chopping trees
But God gave us the gift to up piff like we’re chopping trees
With the scripts that I rip like it’s [?] paper
Stole a dream up my sleeve, I’mma wear it to caper
So, Your Honor, I’m guilty as charged
No questions asked, I seized the moment and I’m bending the laws
No gravity, high forms of flattery, on the cusp
When niggas clone a style that they mad at me, on my nuts
Pause, I’m an all-star, F1, light the flag
Best of raw soul when the harbor guns is on blast
I’m here to shine light on niggas like the po-lice do
Now they runnin’ my plates and got a gun in my face because the flow lethal
I told ‘em that he’s hoping not the type of dope he’s smokin’

[Verse 4: CY Young]
I don’t mean to sound like I’m meaning to sound off
But if you don’t put it down trust I ain’t coming around y’all
I used to be sound with the round ball
But now I sound good like I found a new reason to sound off
CY Young, not because of the As
But more so because of the way cousin would get paid
But this is just a side way
‘Cause I don’t purvey like I’m getting bank
I don’t care what you think
Me, I’m on the brink
The cusp like dawn of the sunlight
The crutch, I ain’t leaning, I come right
So you should get the feeling it’s done right
And when you get to hearing know the difference between us and not quite

[Verse 5: Kaimbr]
Unlikely spite, nah
We plan to handle like chances
Time to double up them advances
You a fan of that, cancer
I’m doubling pampers
Onesies, [?], strive right, walk with ‘em
Coulda bailed, stood a chance I could feel
So when the speaker blow it’s more wind for your sails
Single pops, sending y’all single shots
No preliminary warning, I’m on it
Official world [?]global warming
Shine, bet the moon reflect the heat swarming
Grind to the sky, project my broad’s armor
Soldiers in the struggle, salute us with your arms up
