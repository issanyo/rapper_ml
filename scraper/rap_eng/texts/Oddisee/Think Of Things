[Verse 1]
I'm feeling so good right now
As if everything I'm saying's understood right now
Usually I'm all biz, preoccupied with shoulds
But now a brother playing with some coulds right now
See I could just dial up this smile
I ain't seen in a while, fuck, or just have a night on town
Shucks, I love options, good life now

[Hook]
(Ayo, what more can I say)
Well I can think of a few things

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep my levels of stress down
Not get all worked up when I get let down
Just keep my work up, prepare for the next round
Work out; it'll work out, flex now
I'm trying to have the answers in advance to the next how
So doing won't be much of a test now
You want a better future, better give it your best now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Politics I might get involved in
But knowing me I'll probably get endorsed by the wrong men
Shady individuals who make the law bend
And when I got a problem, always tell me to call them
I might learn to trade and invest in the market
I know a guy that knows a guy that works in the mosh pit
My inside trader with stock tips

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm all about preserving my time
Not everybody sending messages deserves a reply
In this generation of now; urgency's high
If you subscribe, then your nerves will be fried
So I've learned to be quiet, cause loud don't always mean live
You wanna rise, but don't deserve to be fly

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Peace out to PG county
Moco, Va, and all the surrounding
Areas of DC; I rep that proudly
Bump this through your speakers like your reefer: loudly
I'm a Largo nigga; Toine, what's up, mo
Marlboro all-stars out for that gusto
Until the day I die, though the budget is low, still

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
I'm trying to get my fam and my team straight
Get us to the point we don't need plates
All eating off the same tray, and with our hands
It's cultural; my family's from the Sudan
From the building of the pyramids to pyramid schemes
Yes, ah yes, I am a victim of the American greed
I succeed, as if it was a part of the plan, Indeed
