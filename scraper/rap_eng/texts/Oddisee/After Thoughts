You might think my words are gift wrapped
Putting a positive spin on a world of riffraff
But we are all equals
Underneath the evil is good
So you shouldn't criticize me trying to uplift that
My presence today with mix match
Of population caught in the fantasy who'd rather sit back
Effervescence shining with ways to bring the bliss back
In fact the ages shall be courageous I wish that
The city wasn't being gentrified
Another generation of gentrification leads to the next high rise
When politician's in the limelight they open their eyes
Shutting the venues and night life to their corporate demise
So ask yourself what are your priorities?
To whine and moan and hide alone behind your computer screens?
Or can we rise over these disguises of leaves?
Cause society's still falling and crawling and stalling and trying to breathe
Equality's necessary for race and gender
They're trying to get married and sexuality is still praying to blend in
Is the media still deceiving or bridging the gap?
Are we reading for any reason or just living to chat?
Are we eating all our feelings with guilt after the fact?
Are we bleeding or healing to get our fill of the glass?
Empty or full it's time fill up my gas
Then see me pull my weight accelerate and kill every task
Then steal every mask separate hate from the blast
Ground zero built upon with patience and class
Ground below still the one that's shaping this man
Now we know we're beyond all the pain in these hands
No more waiting for the sadness to vacate this land
So yo I'm waking up to have this day to command
Saving all this vastness with ways to have grandkids
Educating elevating putting faith in this plan
