[Verse 1: Toine]

Look, how the fuck did i get here?
I ain't talking being alive
I mean working for the machine
With the dream in my eye
No contact, if you wack
You don't need a reply
This nigga O told me early there's a seat in the ride
To success 'bruh
You blessed
What you need I provide
So if i wasn't shot-gunning
It was me and my pride
Got me feeling the same way i felt when my Grandmomma died
I'm getting old, time bleeding out
This ain't what i dream about
Up beating the sun, on that first bus leaving out
The city just ain't for me no more
Trust when I'm breathing out, the smoke
When I be on stage, they be like, 'Toine Go!'
But back home, I'm still a John Doe from upper Marlboro
Nah Yo
Fuck that
If I ain't got the condo
Living bomb jo, fuck your top 5 convo
I'm gone so
Passed like, Rajon Rondo
Gotta keep it real like Los Blancos
I rep for my mom, Jo
Yo
Plus who got my back too
And 'ion mean for whatever rap do
Its just a capsule, I'm actual


[Verse 2: Oddisee]

Most of my fans think that I'm underrated
I put myself within the box amongst the ones who made it
Amongst the greatest and the latest at the same time
I'm killing stages with your favorites and evading Shine
And me I'm fine with the position that I'm in
But my listeners think I should be positioned in the tens
Top fives, number ones, all the awards
And all the shit that comes with it, that I tend to ignore
This is classic over fashion, lasting over passing
Passion over niggas who just do shit for reactions
I may not ever be on BET at a show
But I done seen the fucking globe so fuck accepting some gold
Fuck your VIP parties I'd rather chill on the sofa
Smoke some shisha, my feet up, my lady bout to come over
No chips upon my shoulder, I'm just speaking how I feel
My nigga I'm good for real
I got a house, and a fridge full of meals, a lot of time to kill
And my nigga I'm good for real


[Verse 3: Trek Life]

To the listeners I gave y'all the best of me
And when that wasn't enough, I gave the rest of me
I thought that talent and hard work would be the recipe
But that cake never did bake up successfully
And trust me
I was in the kitchen constant
New styles we rocked 'em
Shows we had 'em popping
Penning new concoctions
I guess I probably should have been a doctor or a lawyer
[?] could properly destroy ya'
In the lab straight toiling
While my album get ignored my blood boiling
Why the fuck y'all keep passing up me in line?
But Im out
I'm 'finna shine from the side line
Goodbye
I'mma let Toine serve you up
Sean wise hurtin 'em
Stick figure and hard work set to murder ya'
I put in all this grind and they say 'we never heard of ya'
Damn that had me trippin'
But maybe the real mission
Was to set the stage so the next generation can glisten
So I'm cool man
I mean, I guess I'm cool man
