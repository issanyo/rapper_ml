Yeah, it’s 4 A.M
Show ya what I been through tho
You know

[Verse 1: King Mez]
Yeah, uh, you’re talking to a nigga who
Been through the wire
And sharing my experience to me
That’s die, that’s alright
And wearing my red tie
Won’t make me feel like a luck
When I told you I would touch your soul
I know deep down I ain’t doing this in vain
Cause I like nice things but I ain’t doing it for no chain nigga
All these…lame and they mama feeling they pain nigga
Wanna leave the city, they ain’t affording no plane nigga
Till these young rappers do whatever, so their life change
This game don't love you neither watch the way you sign names
And I ain’t into playing mind games
I just figured that I'm be the best, my strategy Lebron James
That’s why I left and right, barely departing nigga
Tight circle, never really looked to make my squadron bigger
Royalty in my words you just wobble what you started nigga
Acting like you on your job so time martin nigga
I ain’t playing even when radio play me
On my grind I worry bout people who play me
I thought they did because care I’m the king that just ain’t me
Shot from the crown but that they can’t see
God gave it to me you won’t see it less you’re equal
I don't do swag but you can feel my aura when I meet you
Not talk to the future, I’m just trying to make a sequel
I can’t be reunited they will make you do your preview
You feel that? Yeah

That’s the feeling my life changing
Right before your eyes, it’s crazy
I mean? I went from seeing million hundreds
To homies with the…designers
Eating lunch at the mersa
Pretty women be on us, one of em got salmi juice on my yeezy 2s/
Oh good I got a homie that’s working at donnas/
That’s just the way it is when you young and you cease the game
Bout to eat this yeah I say Grace and Jesus name
I got Fettuccini and I know my nigga need the same
Speaking plans in front of nonbelievers I won’t be the shame
Those people miss out but on people you don’t see a game
Hit your phone when they hear you buzzing all they see a game
Life like a movie, difference is you never freeze a frame
Too bad they can’t rewind, life will never be the same

Yeah you know, man you tell these nigga be the same
Yeah, uh, and then you fly like you peter pan
Yeah, you know
Comish on the boards oddessi on the beats
And I’d like to thank you all for coming tonight
