[Intro: Oddisee]
Yo... yeah... uhh...
Yo... yeah... it's Oddisee on the mic... yeah...

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
Me and my lonesome roaming
Streets like I'm legion, Roman
Searching for reasons hoping
This earth ain't for heathens holding
Onto beliefs corroding
This bread that they feed us, molding
Looking ahead at oceans just keeping my head afloat and
That moment I notice leaves and they growing more than my trees
I was focused on overseas, now my deeds are completely frozen
Get back to me, I'm coasting
Keep open for breezes blowing
No wind or signs of sea ain't designed for no weezy showing
Come with me though for real like
Real life ain't golden, feel like it's more like some coal
And the pressure molding my soul to real nice
Boulders on shoulders get hype in over the closing
This light ain't glowing at night but it's bright enough
So I go and realize I see in the dark
What I couldn't see when the sun was spark
Part of me found relief in a harder sleep over thought
Deep is the dream I caught in a stream I seem to have fought
And I let it go and it came back when I stopped looking
How about that

[Hook: Oddisee]
I've spent some time alone, I'm out here on my own
I'm looking forward, don't wanna be found but I'm a going
And keep on searching for it, it's out there so I explore it
But when I chose to ignore it, that's of course when I found it
When I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking
I found it when I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking
Found it when I stopped looking

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
It is a space that I'm trying to be in
Tired of being in line to wait
So I stepped aside and I pushed ahead
There's no finding peace with no signs of bleeding
Saw the ledge in the world that we in
I made the plan and it's time to lace
And if I should fall or land on my face
Then I see the scrapes as a part of me in
Moving along, there's no choice in that
We all on the path, but ain't all agreeing
Different laps for the different factions
In the school of thought that we hold degree in
Graduated to the truth and all
Now enter all with the youth involved
We got a bigger dish and need more to fill
And there's smaller fish that you dissolve
I'm searching for what we disregard
As a waste of time and that's time itself
And that's the only thing that I can't obtain
Without getting less than I've give and dealt
My cards is all, and my steezing fell
I was cheating laws and I needed help
Lesson learned, I was less concerned
With a lended hand, with aggressive burns
But that past mistake could be a future great
Refuse to grab what you could choose to take
Advise to act like a know-it-all but that's typical, that's protocol
But when you evolve to a higher height
You see the game from the inner-outs
Found the space that I was looking for
There all along, in a missing boat, yeah
