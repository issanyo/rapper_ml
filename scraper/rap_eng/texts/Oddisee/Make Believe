[Intro]
I wish you were real
Instead of make believe

[Verse 1]
Where everything's fair, people live without care
Unless it's coupled with health, we will all share the wealth
Where our planet won't melt, don't like the hand you've been delt?
It's no biggie for real, you just tell them redeal
And you learn how to play, your cards right from the day
You saw light and could make it alright anyway
Your life will be great, so all I gotta say
(I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?
Where my daughter can play and there's no possible way
She could be kidnapped or raped or even hit by a stray
Where relationships last like grandparents
Nobody is glass, you know transparent
Unbreakable soul, we be great as a whole
Unafriad to be bold, so we taken control
Even making our goals, but it's fake yea I know
(I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?

[Hook]
I'ma speak on it
Then come up with a plot and give it all I got then sleep on it
And I just might pray before I rest I say
(I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?

[Verse 2]
Where you would do drugs to get rid of your pain
All you need is love would be more than a saying
We would value our people and not the money they earn
We never stop growing always looking for something to learn
And our women would know that their scalp ain't something to burn
You were beautiful long before you were fucking with perms
Tummy tucks, implants, and such
Girl I (I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?
Where there's only crabs on your plate or in the sea
They maybe I wouldn't have bastards hating on me
Where hate don't exist and happiness thrives
Where we struggle much less to live happier lives
We believe in ourselves like we believe in god
Wouldn't be up in jail, life wouldn't be as hard
I know this dream is far fetched
I guess but I (I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Where people stop wishin' and start completin' their mission
Where we all would teach fishin', always eager to listen
Where industry stable and people pay you your fee
Then maybe I would be able to do this youth work for free
Where there's no need for a center for alternative learnin'
Where the teachers would be worthy of the money they're earnin'
Better education, constant elevation
(I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?
I work toward it everyday so I can make you see
The world I'm talkin' about ain't just gotta be make believe
So whenever you decide to more than complain
Maybe the world will change instead of more of the same
Children in horrible pain, floss without any aim
Lost trying to maintain cause their family's lame
They need some dedication, even a better nation
(I wish you were real) Hey, I can dream can't I?

[Hook]
