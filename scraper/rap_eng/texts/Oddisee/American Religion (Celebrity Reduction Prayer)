[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la
I know I invited you, I still want you to leave now
This is a whole long thing just telling you to leave my mind, leave

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
I woke up down in this dungeon
I've made mistakes in my judgments
I've built you up in my head this is my prayer for your reduction
You're not my aunt, uncle or cousin
Not your nephew or your husband
You think just 'cause you buzzin' you got licence but you doesn't
I hugged you like a glo-worm, come down now cause it's your turn
I ain't got nothing but time I like that long haul to that slow burn
I did too much of my homework
Killed my confidence with this research
I've put people on pedestals ego's reaction is knee-jerk
I'm trying to work on my weakness
It's not all roses and peaches, it's no secret
I've found myself in a funk for a whole weekend
Over email failures and DMs
"Did they get that shit? Should I re-send?"
What should I do when I see them?
Talk all soft and passive like Cleveland
Even wise men can go mindless
Voluntarily rocking them blinders
It generates all this shyness calling some other human your highness
They forgot about when they punched clocks
With Capri Suns in their lunchbox
Bad haircut with them sunspots
Drank fruit punch and wore dumb socks, yeah!

[Hook]
You're not my moms, you're not my father
Not my food, you're not my water
Not your earth, get out my lava
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion
Get out my food, you're not my java
Not my nurse, you're not my doctor
Not my priest, you're not my lama
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion

[Verse 2]
It's not worth my attention
Let alone all of these mentions
This first time is a warning, the next move is suspension
Got my own lapses in thinking, my processes were stinking
You're not Gandhi, you're not Yoda, you're not President Linking
Give a fuck if you was Oprah, Wolf Blitzer, or Al Roker
If you try to put yourself over I'll laugh at you like The Joker
This Hellfyre's my culture, put magic all in these cold words
I'm you as the slogan putting up mirrors instead of these posters
Watch me smash all of these idols got my own heavyweight title
There's no upper tier, we're all peers unless y'all want to be rivals
Talent's just a foundation rapped in festivals and in basements
If I ever lost my head I got good friends to replace it
Gives a fuck if you're on TV, you still poop and you still pee-pee
You sat down and got started not knowing there wasn't no TP
You got up then and you waddled
That shit might happen tomorrow
Whether you're a ball player, a stage actor, or international model
I don't care, neither should no one, I'll say that shit to Hulk Hogan
Obama down to Joe Rogan
Head of the studio that made Frozen
My brain's variable tape speed, SubGenius or hayseed
Try waving your resume, all the sudden I can't read, yeah!

[Bridge]
Get your name, fame can make you evil
And that's the shame cause we done lost so many people
It gets ingrained we start behaving like a sheep do
This song is a prayer when you should aim it where you need to
When you say it they believe you
This is a prayer and you should aim it where you need to

[Hook]
