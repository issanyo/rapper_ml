If you had just a taste of the life that I live
Your past would be but a waste because you'd try to be him
You think you right, in the wrong, that's why you tryna fit in
But why you scared of the jewels you could be mining within?
Because the fear on the news, and the lies from they lips?
I'll give you purely the truth until this finally ends
When the stars all align, and the sky becomes red
With the fire of every life that's been dying to live
Lying on the street, begging passingbyers to give
I still love em like I loved em before time had began
In a world where the poor, seen as flies in the wind
I'll be on these beats til the day I'm finally rich
With no money, it ain't nothin but a pile of debt
Yet they show money to ya kids, as a sign of respect
It's so funny how we live, and try to be them
Cause while he fiend for the stacks, he got minimum wage
And stacks ain't gonna change how this system is made
We livin in graves, mothafuckin government slaves
Ruled by corporate puppets, with nothin to say
There's something to say, they trying to take your world today
That's something to face, it's something that we all gotta change
Embrace yourself, not the wealth that they show on your screen
I know all the real people gon know what I mean
We growing to kings, that's what you get for following dreams
And showing your team, they've always been starwalking beings
Why follow me? You already are all that you need
There's nothing in between you and who you've wanted to be
Just be true to yourself, and you're bound to achieve
