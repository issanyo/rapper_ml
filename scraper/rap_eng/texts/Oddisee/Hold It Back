[Verse 1]
I'm asked to speak but not to tell the truth
Anonymously, in the credits you can check the proof
In the camera, innovators and creators real
In the mirror, imitators and the takers steal
That's a practice put in action that could win awards
Yeah, we love the frauds
But hate the ones that really come with cause
Moment of silence for me, I don't really need applause
Think I'm loud enough when I'm alone with all my inner thoughts
May I never meet the people I'm inspired by
And find out that they're really, really fake or they just kind of lied
Kind of surprised I was able to keep my mouth shut
This long, but
On this song, I'ma tell ya how I feel, being quiet is a crime
Not enough fake Gs doing time
I’m not the only one to notice that
I’m cutting all my ties
I think it's time I stopped holding back

[Chorus]
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back

[Verse 2]
I make more than my sister
'Cause I was born as a mister
And I ain't never been to college, and she graduated honors
Yet the bosses think that I'm a better fit, uh
Well, that annoy me more than cargo shorts
And yoga pants that's worn at anything that's not a sport
Dinner plans at eight
And if show you up in some sneakers better call me in advance to say you running late
I’m a contemporary man
I mean take it back to what, so y'all could screw it up again
While you’re running for an office, I'ma run away from coffins
Pray the policies show progress 'fore they boot it up again

[Refrain]
'Cause every time we restart it
We gon' push the demons deeper in the closet
It ain't no secret, they just seeping out regardless
We're keeping logic hostage
We need to stop

[Chorus]
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back

[Verse 3]
Tell them how you really feel, they label you a hater
That's the greatest trick impostors ever played on the creator
You around here acting like we’re equal but we greater
Bring up talent all you want but you can keep your résumé though
Talk is cheaper now and it is just dropping by the day though
Take precaution putting stock in anything somebody say though
We gon' tell you anything we want to get a payload
Don't be shocked if we come talking to you like it was a day old

[Refrain]
Clock restarted
We gon' push the demons deeper in the closet
It ain't no secret, they just seeping out regardless
We're keeping logic hostage
We need to stop

[Chorus]
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back
Hold it back, hold it back (no I can't)
Hold it back

[Outro]
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back, hold it
