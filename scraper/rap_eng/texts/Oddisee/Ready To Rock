[Verse 1]
They say you’ve got your whole life to make your first album
Guess I’ve been busy living so that first outcome
Was worth hearing so, here it goes
Let me kick a verse and amp; just zone out-from
The time I was concieved, I honestly believed, I was destined for something I couldn’t break from
It’d be cliche to say greatness, but hey this
Is what I’ve learned, what you are your can’t escape from
So embrace it, don’t run away from
Being that digit in that everyday equation
That’s steady glitching, itching for limits to break
See nothing can get in your way if what you deliver is great
And there we are back to greatness
I think I’ve discovered what my place is, in theory it’s basic
It’s me doing me, over time, utter rhymes
Is a butterfly effect that affects mankind

[Chorus]
Y’all ready to rock
Yup, we ready to roll

[Verse 2]
Took a little of time, had to get the rhymes right, had to get the lines right
Looking at my future like it’s all up in my hindsight, I believed that, boy it would have been a climb
Sat up on my bed thinking I was on the sideline, eyes wide shut thinking about that bread
If I believed that boy it would have been a crime, so I took it to the sleep and amp; I dreamed instead
Took it as a sign then I took to the streets
Took it from the books then I took it to the beats
Looking at my grind like a stretch doing time
From the day that I signed to the date of my release
Yeah, I’m doing fine, doing fine to say the least
I ain’t trying to line with the rest, trying to shine with the best, til the lime just focus on me
As it should, if I can than it could, be the case
So I ran, over tracks, life I could, beat the race
Overlapping who was laughing at the start, they depart
Call it perm, I know it burns that I’m relaxing in your face
Listen, I am on my job I set the standards and amp; the rates
Live and amp; learn how discern the need for chill and amp; making haste
Now it’s time for everybody in the crowd to up the pace
Cause, I’m ready to rock, apologize for the wait

[Chorus]
