[Hook: Substantial]
We gon' bring the hip hop swing
Sit back relax, let us do our thing
Let us do our thing
Yeah, let's do our thing
Why can't I do my thing? (Go 'head and do your thing!)

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I'm so cool, can't explain why I sound so hot
I make quality music, ya I rhyme a lot
Run with your little cock, what's the big idea?
? ? ? ? get pushed for sittin' in my chair
Shush little youngin', grown folk in here
Ok, so lay low til' the coast is clear
K.O. they flow then disappear
If y'all never scurred then I'm Mr. Fear

[Verse 2: Iomos Marad]
They fear me and they panic when they go up against us
Flow; that I own, cuz' they know it's relentless
Leavin' a trail of wounded rappers once the war is on
One line, from the mind, to the head (he gone!)
For all you young and little rappers you better beware
Your money and your jewels get burned in here
Every stripe that you get gets earned in here
You can catch a (smack to the face boy...)

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
I got no scheme, no gimmick
No bling, no women
Just one, no fleein'
No spendin', no glamour
No smoke, no hammer
No bammers that run around me
No matter
No drinks, no mix
No folks in the slammer
No coke in the crack
No smokes on the lack
No black on black crime
But when I rhyme, y'all feel me cuz' a brother only speakin' with facts
Time...

[Hook: Substantial][x2]
We gon' bring the hip hop swing
Sit back relax, let us do our thing
Let us do our thing
Let us do our thing
Can I do my thing? (Go 'head and do your thing!)

[Verse 4: Oddisee]
Give it up, like it or not;
Call me date rape
Most y'all are homos for real, or ya straight fake
Didn't go to culinary school but I make cake
Take lead, T.C., so they play straight
Nothing funny. Still hungry so I scrape plates
Moonwalk over beats past daybreak
Some of y'all mighta been nice in your heyday
But we runnin' things nowadays
Better make way

[Verse 5: Iomos Marad]
Mayday, mayday
They crashin' again
They styles are PC
I'm a virus to them
Writer's block got em' stuck while I speed through the track
In fact, my style's brand new, compared to a Mac
O.S., oh yes, cuz' I'm x'ing them out
Mike Tyson on the beat, y'all scared to go about
Your business as usual, movements are critical
Beats... Off...

[Verse 6: Oddisee]
I been in this game for years
It made me civilized
I--sympathize with brothers who lack enterprise
A--gainst all odds, all still breathing and all leading up
All still tryin'a break even
Leader of the present day; the el presidente in the hip-hop way
A life I dictate, that any other way ain't right
Cuz' I'm leader of the free world

[Hook: Substantial][x2]
We gon' bring the hip hop swing
Sit back relax, let us do our thing
Let us do our thing
Let us do our thing
Can I do my thing? (Go 'head and do your thing!)
