[Verse 1]
Been in this game for years, it made me intelligent
Stupid niggas fade into irrelevance
I'm permanently settled in like melanin, Adamantium Skeletons
The sickness is immune to modern medicine
Fighting ancient evils on the steeples and pulpits
Nowadays we call it beefing, drama, and bullshit
Most of these niggas half man but they full bitch
Wolves in the full moon only useful for smelling scents
Me I'm a predator and I'm telling ya get the fuck from around me
Before they find you in the bushes with hell of dents
This blood sport and y'all bleeding between the legs
And I'm in no need of eggs my lady got hella hips
I'm after the presidents representing the capitol
Any rapper from my residence I promise I'm better than
Citizen of the globe any place that I ever been
I pissed on
That was for the wolves that were smelling scents
Now get gone

[Hook]
I know that Yeezus was a mortal man
And, HOV ain't Jehovah, just a normal man
And, we all lambs to the slaughter
We all die, but some die harder
Which one is you?
I mean...
Is you a runner or you running shit?
Is you a fetcher or you summon shit?
I'm the definition of a martyr let my name live on
As the king without a throne with all the honor

[Verse 2]
Niggas want to bring the 90's back
I'm still using 70's slang, that shit behind me jack
Born in the 80's Ronald Reagan tried to slide me crack
The walking dead was hunted by Feds, yo where the lively at?
Out of trouble and on the hustle where I be at
I live within the jungle and on the humble the silent cat
Louder the lion, the louder the lying
The closer these niggas get to death, and the louder the crying
Holler at me, won't get a response I'm over seas
When my phone tone change I'm gone you know my steez
See Islam Salaam is the belief
And they synonymous with bombs but I'm one over beats
But you can't box with odds your arms will never reach
So trying to talk to God the odds you'll never speak
But, you could start by washing both of your feet and praying with open hands
And bending both of your knees

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See now a days we worship the stars
That do nothing to deserve the applause that they receive
We huddle below the bar, sub-par is the new degree
With the artists that's out now mustn't be hard to reach
Anybody can come even close to being a beast
They see them selves as God or regard them selves as the chief
The streets is hungry for kings, the kings are hunting for rings
My nigga I don't wear jewelry so fuck who rocking a chain
I'm just rocking a beat, mo I'm just doing my thing
Making money from rapping who claiming that talk is cheap
If record sales and talent was ever one in the same
I'd be running the game if that rule were ever to change
But this a tangible dream, I don't do it for fame
I just do it for heads, I just do it for bread
I don't do it for names, so fuck who standing in line
You focusing on the guest list
I'm focused on my set bitch

[Hook]
