[Verse 1]
Sorry I called, too many times
The way you left me earlier left plenty on my mind
Saying I ain’t deserving you, blaming me for the fall
Or the decline, I ain’t involved in us
My heart of ice left you salty, dissolving trust
I know I’m faulty but, that’s not a crime
In forty eight hours we’ll be fine like Nolte
Normally that’s like the case but this time around
I’m bent around five, intent just to dial
Your number, wonder, we can reconcile
If we could work it out, like plumbers
That’s water under, the bridge, we crossed it
Fire when we fight so that bridge we lost it
Let me pipe down, emulating a faucet
I’m smoking like a muffler, you’ve got me exhausted

[Hook]
Maybe I’ve been drinking, maybe I’ve been smoking
But baby I’ve been thinking, that maybe we’re just broken
And maybe we can’t fix it, see maybe we’re just hopeless
Or maybe we need romance, so maybe we’ll just hold hands
Maybe

[Verse 2]
Hi, it’s me again, in need again, I’m really high
See what I see us being in can we pretend
That this never happened look, I’m really smacked and shook
The weed begins, to kick in action, don’t get it twisted
Cause these thoughts are with reason and
I go and twist it, so yeah, I’m lifted
Spoken like I’m truly broken so you can get it
Our happy home had a foreclosure so we’re evicted
So now our clothes are, sitting on the street
And I sifted through my sleeves to find my heart still had a beat
Now that’s thrifty, seemed like I’m tailored new
Why you trying to rip me
I know I sounded sincere when I said that it was over
Don’t ever listen to me when I’m sober

[Hook]
