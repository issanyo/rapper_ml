[Hook]
Look into my soul
When you do, can you let me know:
What do you see
When you're looking at me?
We can lose control
If you're ready, then I gotta know
Where you wanna be
Where you wanna be?

[Verse 1: Astonish]
I'm trying to be a better me
Poetically, there ain't a nigga that's ahead of me
I better be the one you come to see when I'm in town
And you can start acting like we're more than just friends now, and make love
Not war cause we're losing a lot more
Confusing the youth in the booth like we're not poor
Cause I don't make it rain, but can bring a little sunshine
Kick your pain, let you unwind
I got a fire that they can't put out, that's why I stood out
And you're the next DMX, bringing the hood out
Astonish gonna kill it, who don't feel it?
Covered in weed smoke, it cover the floor, ceilin', I'm so chillin'

[Verse 2: Jay Vega]
Where you wanna be is wherever I are
Like a shooting star, she spot me from far
The twinkle in your eye sets my heart ablaze
Where you wanna be is right here with Jay
She tells me that she loves me, but not with words
Her action speaks louder than a booming system, word
Bodies connect like ethernet connection
It's that 4G love and you gotta respect it
I let her do her; in turn, she do me
Can't ask for anything better, it's a beautiful thing
In complete silence, we vibin'
Presidential suites for my sweets, let's hit the island
Taking trips without leaving the crib, yeah, we wildin'
From the looks of things, my sense of humor got her smilin'
My diamond girl, she shining and I got her, there's no problem
From far I send her my love: 'mwah'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Decay]
I gotta be a better me
But since being a gentleman is in the pedigree
Sometimes people see weakness and the kindness
And when they look at me they must be sufferin' blindness
Hard to see the hardness of the level over bass and treble
And I can't afford to freeze like they poured metal
So I settle into the mirror, I see some devils behind it
Not Illuminati; it's the mistakes, I can't rewind it
But the finest is the D-E, I'm happy when I see me
Foreign in this game but still house the neighbors like a teepee
Sound up, seat back, I'm leaned up in the ride
Square biz, straight talk, look into my eyes
You might see a lot more than what you saw before
We all got good and bad, but who you ride for in the war?
So from the heart, I'd rather build you up and help you through
While you still sizing me up, so now I'm looking at you
