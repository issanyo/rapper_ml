Can I get a mic check 1-2?
I'm in the spot and I need to ask you know I want to
Grab the m-i-c and spit somethin' nice
Drop a cold jewel for brothers that be wantin' ice
And for the ladies in the joint you know I'm glad  you came
Please excuse me if I know you I forgot your name
I got a bad memory but you remember me
You ain't the first to say we had intemacy
But anyway good to see you again
Party started at 9:30 hope to see you at 10:00
Can't talk to you now 'cause you're siggy with him
But I'm a slide to the side and I'm a leave you a pen
You know what to do just write your number
And we could hook up and have a private slumber
I love the way the body just move the sound
That's why a brother always at the music lounge
Yeah

Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound

Can I get a mic check 3-4?
The crowd jumpin' up and down like a see-saw
The place to be is where I'm at and y'all here too
Somebody said all the (?) is all near you
'Cause I'm a magnet for beats that are classic
Shorties with bodies that are fantastic
The music is like an afrodesiac
But other brothers on the mic you could see me at
And ain't a thing better than a good soul clap
Whoever got the microphone let me hold that
And I'm a show that I feel the rhythm in vibe
Those who drive by park they're cars and come inside
'Cause I'm attractive but not in a vein sense
Sorta like here tonight I'm the main event
So if you like what you here embrace the jam
Everybody in the spot just wave you hands
Yeah

Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound

Can I get a mic check 5-6?
I'm like the news I always gotta bring the live shit
To inquiring people inspiring
Feelin' down I'm here to make you feel alive again
Get your soul movin'
This hit is a soul movement
Bodies are (?) you of in Home Improvement
Build with me
Relax back and chill with me
I put my feelings on this paper so get real with me
Don't leave me hangin'
5 on the black side
I'm all about soul music and black pride
What else is it
I'm glad y'all came to visit
Y'all really in for a treat 'cause the flow exquisite
See for yourself
Or better yet you gotta hear it
Not with your ears though, but your spirit
Just close your 2 eyes and open your 3rd
And witness vibrations spoken in word
Word y'all

Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
Sit back relax and enjoy the sound
And stand up and get live and just move around
You are now in tune to the music lounge
And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
