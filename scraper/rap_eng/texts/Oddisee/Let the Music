[Intro: ?, LMNO]
My style's unorthodox, but of course it rocks. (1, 2)
The lyrics I bring them. Keeps the crowd hyper. (yeah)
Yo, hit it!

[Hook: LMNO]
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music
Get you up, get you up
Let the music
Get you up, get you up

[Verse 1: LMNO, Oddisee]
Let 'em run 'em up, they'll get exhausted
Straight coughin' tryn' run with the bossman
Lost it before they ever got it
Four corners of the Earth, dispersed like ?
Out the circuit, we electrify
Intensive ?. Stand back. Caution
With rock-solid beats that petrify
Stuck in the lights of my lime-bright flossin'
O-Double D-I-S-Double E
A L to the M to the N to the O
Now that we spelled it out correctly
Rock ? in the West, rock Timbs on my ?
Laid out, they don't stand a chance
Left 'em like cards. Center stage they fold
Just another victim of circumstance
And that's nothin' new man the story quite old

[Hook: LMNO, ?]
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
It's gettin' kinda hectic
My rhyme is authentic
My style's unorthodox, but of course it rocks
This move is what's next

[Verse 2: LMNO, Oddisee]
Two in my ? nightstands in the place
Shawty I don't glance. I stand at ?
No kind of contest. Inferior complex
When a broad noticed that she rrrroll like "r"
Hittin' the floor, it's a human tornado
I really wanna learn to breakdance in the ?
Clear out the circle and fight the world
Backspinnin' man. That's found quite hard
Old bubble letters with the fat outline
Gain two turntables and a mic with speakers
No stock tips, we invest in time
Invest the rhyme. Every line go boss
Bang it. Accept it. Gotta respect it
Erry neighborhood, I'm good like ?
Never outdated. Remain effective
Stayin' in the game, we remain like stars

[Hook: LMNO, ?]
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music
Get you up, get you up
Let the music (Let the music)
Get you up, get you up
It's gettin' kinda hectic
My style's unorthodox, but of course it rocks
The lyrics I bring them. Keeps the crowd hyper
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
Let the music (let the music)
Get you up (get you up)
