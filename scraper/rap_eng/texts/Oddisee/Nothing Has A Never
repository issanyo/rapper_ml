[Verse 1: Oddisee]
Slow pace in the fast lane with no brakes
I’m on a mission to Mars, just tryna be
Light years ahead by far and so great
At what I do, you can’t fake on my style
This is truth, I’m up nights to nothin’ nice
Forget the noose, live a little this one time
No second chance, there is no riddle
Just punchlines to circumstance, wish I was jokin’ though
This is what I’m goin’ for, to do it like I’m so-and-so
Cause when you think you special, they come get you off your totem pole
I just keep it low and pro and do more in the moment though
Than most would know and which won’t be disclosed until I overdose
Throwin’ it [?] without the roses though
Cause I don’t need no help I’m wakin’ on my own and no
I don’t have a limit, I’m just livin’ like the road is closed
Drivin’ at a pace that Cadillacs contain the older folks

[Hook: Oddisee]
I’m just tryna keep together whatever can be severed
While movin’ through the motion of forever, I tell ya
That nothing has a never, nothing has a never
Nothing has a never, nothing has a never

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
Well if I could do nothin’ for somethin’ that would be great
But doin’ somethin’ for nothin’ is more likely the case
Today be called a freelancer instead for lack of pay
Listen, I don’t give a fuck what you say
Cut the tap, we highly competitive in this state
Cut the neck as we talk, to get ahead in this space
Void killin’ and noise killin’ the solitude
I’m unfamiliar with silence, ain’t on my longitude
Ain’t one for browsin’ expandin’ cause man I’m on the move
I’m on a mission to Mars and my Mars is on the move
Recordin’ what I’m goin’ through like I’m fillin’ they mornin’ view
Heart of an artist from many sides and the process ask if I feel it the hardest
Cause I am always the target, makin’ myself as such
It sound as clutch as I’m graspin’ and sendin’ me as a duff
Troubles ain’t in the bluff and this album ain’t really tough
I just hope my passions make me go nuts

[Hook]
