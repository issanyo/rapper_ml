[Intro: 20syl]
Keep it on the level
Keep it on the level
Keep it on the level
(Whoa-oh)
I'm I'm I'm climbing up the
Keep it on the level
Keep it on the level
I'm climbing up the ladder
While you're in need of a shovel
(Whoa-oh)

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I could do this all day
I could do this all night (I could do this all night)
I could I could I could
I could do this all day
I could do this all night
(I could do this all night)

I could do this all day, I could do this all night
All month, all year, for my whole entire life
Who you know got a home, but seem to live on the road
Lookin' like a black gypsie, in the Caravan, arose
Music for the people, I used to rap on the train
Now I rap on a stage and I'm used to capital gain
I ain't asking for change, I'm good at coining a phrase
What I want is more than ever and never to fade away
Is that too much to ask? Good, cause I ain't askin'
Already into action, I'll have your answer retracted
So stay up out my business, it's crowded enough with me
You added as just a witness Iâ€™d rather not even see
I'm good with the folks around me, get from 'round me
Before we commence to clowning, yeah
Keep it on the level, yeah, keep it on the level
I'm climbing up the ladder while you in need of a shovel
Skedaddle

Yo, skedaddle

[Hook 2: Oddisee]
Don't give it to me easy, I like a little challenge
Winning feels better when you take a little damage
Slow learning, fast earning, stay burning, wheels turning
It's a ongoing, ongoing, ongoing thing
Don't give it to me easy, I like a little challenge
Winning feels better when you take a little damage
Slow learning, fast earning, stay burning, wheels turning
It's a ongoing, ongoing, ongoing thing

Yo, skedaddle
