She was like a gun with a clip
A poisonous snake with a fork-tongued kiss
Her love hurt at times, but I so loved it
Mixed it in my rhymes, and I said "fuck it"
I can show up, console her, but couldn't hold her
Rub her shoulders and blow her but didn't know her
She left me in an instant, I see her in the distance
But I'm too much of a g to be that persistent
Need I mention, my heart's in my pocket
Ice cold stone and I even padlocked it
Stop it, she comes back for a week and
I thought love was good, nurse this pain that I'm feeling
I'm reeling and pulling back
A grown man confused, I put it in my raps
In my car kept a bag, in my home kept a gun
In my bed I had grenades and a pack of condoms
Mama you dumb, never ran, never will
I can kill you so bad but I still
Protect myself perfect, prepare for the worst
This seven years bad luck, broke a mirror's curses
Verses and shots, the poison that rots
I enjoy the passion at times it gets hot
Please forgive me not
Acid makes you fonder as I wander
A mockery of karma, we fucked in La Varna
And we fuck till the morning
Mistook this night for love and left without a warning
She had me asleep snoring
Baby let me dream, and after nights of pain
I enjoy your schemes, I enjoy these genes
And the way they came off
Minute turn to hours and I'm so lost
