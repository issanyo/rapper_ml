[Verse 1: Red Pill]
I let the radio play, hear it softly off in the distance
Drowning it out, washing the dishes
Day dreamin about cocoa butter kisses
The windows crack the a little cause
The temper is double digits
I'm in an awesome position
But I lost my ambition depression is awfully viscous
Lately I find it that the target don't listen
And I always look behind me when I'm crossing those bridges
Somebody told me maybe I should write a happy song
I told her when I feel it, I will baby it can't be long
Cause I won't make it at this pace so mad
Itry to break up out these feelings
But they stay intact
I get so close to getting rid of, I'm like baby fat
Just when I think about the
That's part of me that gets ignored
Finish the dishes, sweep the kitchen floor

[Hook: Red Pill]
And everybody goes through it
Sometimes you feel like you'll never come back
Like you'll never come back
And all I do is worry, all I do is worry about you
And all I do is worry

[Verse 2: Blu]
I swear nobody's been stressin' out the way I've been stressin' out
Sometimes I can't let it out, it's clouding my head in doubt
The cloud that I made is a cloud that is running blocking my
Heaven is just not a step no more, no it's more like a ride
Lessons I learned 'em in debt
Pulling me out of my debt
But running from all of this debt is fuckin exhausting
When I fall, mind that I never crawled

But still I chose to fly, not just when I close my eyes
But more like when I chose to shine bright as a jewels in the sky
My papa once called a star
Mama said make a wish
My lady left me in tears, my love I'll never forget
She said she never said
I told her that man is God, she chose the man on the cross
I pray that my sins have been washed
Why does she wallow in mine
I never would live a lie
Now it's just fucking up

[Hook: Red Pill]
And everybody goes through it
Sometimes you feel like you'll never come back
Like you'll never come back
And all I do is worry, all I do is worry about you
And all I do is worry

[Bridge: Red Pill]
And all this pain that I felt is
Nothing to explain when you're helpless
It's (?) the window and I fly
I let 'em live from the other side
And everybody goes through it

[Verse 3: Red Pill]
Sometimes you feel like you'll never go back
Living your life (?)
Back to that feeling that (?)

And all I do is worry..
About my thoughts and inner ambitions
Caught up in (?) and slipping
Found it in the beginning
Beginning to feel like I've gone missing

[Hook: Red Pill]
And everybody goes through it
Sometimes you feel like you'll never come back
Like you'll never come back
And all I do is worry, all I do is worry about you
And all I do is worry
