HOOK
(Made in Maryland) Don’t get it twisted, dog
I still put the M between the DV
(Made in Maryland) I’ma represent for yall
Regardless where the path I’m on lead me
(Made in Maryland) Pops was from Baltimore
But his only son was born in P.G
(Made in Maryland)

VERSE 1
The home of Tubman and Douglas
Name a rapper better from MD that does this
Spare time. Murk’em low key with a spare rhyme
Old lines shit I came up with in ‘09
No lyin’! Back in Suitland in the nineties
In someone else’s hood baggin rappers  you’d find me
Whippin’ ass taking names ‘fore this rap shit was cool
I was either chasing dreams or chasing ass after school
Ditched class, wings and Mambo Sauce during high times
Cookin’ beats in Ace old crib playing ‘95
Live from the home of Martin and Sugar Ray
I’ma shine for every unknown that took a stray

HOOK
(...in Maryland) Don’t get it twisted, dog
I still put the M between the DV
(Made in Maryland) I’ma represent for yall
Regardless where the path I’m on lead me
(Made in Maryland) Pops was from Baltimore
But his only son was born...
(...in Maryland)

VERSE 2
PG specifically
County might be rich but we all struggled mentally
Trying to see thru imagery placed here to limit me
Killin’ me, black and brown youngins on a killing spree
The way I dodged bullets you’d thought had Trinity
And Zion’s best fighters all guarding my divinity
Had a rack of brothers only one that was kin to me
Saved my life when they gave the mic and the pen to me
But I’m from the same damn state as Freddy Gray
Different city but our death could be one ride away
In the home of Frank Miller and dark nights…
Thought it was, nah you thought right, I’m from...

HOOK
Maryland
Don’t get it twisted, dog
I still put the M between the DV
(Made in Maryland) I’ma represent for yall
Regardless where the path I’m on lead me
(Made in Maryland) Pops was from Baltimore
But his only son was born in P.G
(Made in Maryland)

VERSE 3
Only Prince we claim sang Purple Rain
Prince George was lame, F him and name
I’m a PG King, It’s a PG thing!
This for Gods'Illa, OG’s, See King
Joe D, Steph, Jav and my Baltimore team
That's my man Jsoul and the young homie Green
Damn my friends are dope, yeah we really rap
Fans been losing hope I’ma bring it back
Stan has been dope since pitty pat
Kickball, jump rope and hide and go git it, black
Think I haggled Odd for weeks just to get track
To hand the God some weak shit picture that
Phelps with a felt tip, Olympian flow
Provide more dope lines than Bolivian coke
Durant on the bassline, Carmelo in the key of strife
Ripken and Ruth walking on the field of dreams but I’m
Woke in the land of Thurgood
His momma taught my poppa now I’m out here in your hood
Somewhere in Maryland!
