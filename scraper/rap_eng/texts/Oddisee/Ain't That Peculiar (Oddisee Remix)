[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy bout you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby till I don't want to see

[Hook: Marvin Gaye]
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
I've cried so much just like the child that's lost a toy
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
But I'm so much in love with you baby till I don't want to see

[Hook: Marvin Gaye]
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
I know the question that I'm asking and the answer ain't correct
And if loving you is wrong, well then the answer won't be 'yes'
So I'm lying to myself 'cause lying next to you the best
Every second in your presence worth the minutes of neglect
But them minutes turn to hours and them hours turn to stress
Am I courageous or a coward that's unable to accept
That I'm here but you left, I mean, you here but you ain't right
Yeah, you right here but you ain't like with me so I need to step
You would think that moving on wouldn't even be a sweat
I mean, yeah, you do me wrong but I conveniently forget
I just harbor on the better like whatever to the doubt
When you try to plant a seed I just see a weed in drought
As you twist your lips to lie and it's leaving out your mouth
I decide right then and there that I won't even hear you out
I know love is peculiar but you are even more so
How you wear your heart on your wardrobe? Lord knows

[Hook: Marvin Gaye]
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar, a peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar baby, peculiar as can be
