[Intro]
Things, things, things, things
Things, things, things, things
Things, things, things, things
Things, things, things, things

[Verse 1]
On my mind when I wake up
(Things) all my time try to take up
If I could save up money like worry
I'd be a rich man but sorrow would plague much
I done made up the fiction
That I'm a centre of a system causing the day rust
Center stage and a monologue play of
Me in the audience, all in my make up
What a view when it's all for the show
Assuming that I'm doing what you already know
I think I'm in the middle of a palm heavy globe
Everybody trying to steal what I already own
But oh in this life we are all but alone
The feeling that you are is a problem condoned
Just sunlight hit the spotlight that we hold
Like it's one light that we cuff tight 'til it's gone
One candle on the cake, trying to take it
Souls set sail on the race trying to take wind
We are all faves in the chips that we placing
Better build self, anybody else cave in
So I'm holding onto pressure like it's all mine
That ain't sweat, it's just the way I keep the floor shined
Everybody queued up in the long grind
Thinking that we next in the short line

[Chorus]
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, I got
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah

[Verse 2]
I want a lot more things
Biggie tried to tell me what a lot more bring
A headstrong man would take a lot more strain
Seeing pleasure in the presence of a lot more pain
It's like I'm in the plot of a horror flick scene
And I'ma run towards where I thought I heard screams
'Cause (things) draw me like a self-portrait
Blank paper trying to fill it with a lot more green
'Cause (things) make life, and a life worth living
Is a life worth giving to a fight for dreams
When your schemes matter more than the next man's
And the next man's matter more than the rest and
We all forget that we are not all things
So I'ma take time in the line
All those behind me can chill
But if I was last I'd probably be the first one to whine, for real

[Chorus]
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, I got
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah

[Bridge]
We going through it
They going through it
Us going through it
You going through it
We going through it
They going through it
Us going through it
You going through it

[Verse 3]
We just want to matter more
Tryna be the matador in the pit of bull
Tryna gather our status to the masses
Looking at the glass like that's pitiful
I ain't seein' what you seein' 'cause your problems ain't my problems
How you solve 'em? Really I don't even care
Puttin' pressure on the shoulders that ain't really there
But I know you see it when you stare

[Chorus]
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, I got
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
Things I'm going through, yeah
