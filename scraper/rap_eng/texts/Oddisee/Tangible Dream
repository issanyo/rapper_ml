[Verse 1]
I got dreams of being a rich nigga
A wealthy man is too grand to fit in the big picture
And being broke ain't even in the scope
So what's the plan?
I started thinking like really though, what does money get ya?
A lot of flights and a lot of nights with some loose women
A lot of hype is it really worth it, the truth's pending
And I ain't waiting until the verdict is out
I'm trying to be just what I heard I'm about
And that's me
That's something you don't see
Cause fronting is what we are use to
Well guess I'm out this mother fucker looking like the future
A black man in Norway
Not another prejudice, while you can have your preference
I'ma be black all day
I'ma be out on Broadway
Hands full of bags, can't get a fucking cab
Though the color of my cash, is the same green as yours
Am I angry, of course
Ain't nothing detained me from my cause
And that is...

[Hook]
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah

[Verse 2]
My old soul remains forever young
I've done it all and still I'm doing shit that I ain't ever done
See it depends on your definition of winning
I ain't start it from the bottom, I started from the beginning
Born up in uptown, PG is where I lived
Slept in a dresser draw when we couldn't afford a crib
Parents got a divorce, my father got him a Benz
My mother remained poor, and I was caught in the mix
Now I'm eating fried chicken while talking bout philosophy
Debate the economy while clogging up my arteries
Ghetto boushie nigga so all that shit is apart of me
Gave a nigga an inch, when all we want is yard see
See, this poverty under palm trees
Chilling near the grave and the grove is within arms reach
But thanks to gravity apples is on the ground
And I use my GPS for the scrounge
Show what I already found...

[Hook]
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah

[Verse 3]
So what are you bitching about?
Niggas want to run with the wolves, and now they sitting out
I mean at least you've got a chair, yet you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything focused on never missing out
You know it's fall I got the layers all sticking out
The wax coating on the cotton like I'm rabbit hunting
Gentry, on a bike passing your Bentley
Cycling with a broad while your passenger seat is empty
Lord, she say I'm different I take her to do nice things
Getcha motherfucking car up out that bike lane
Ain't nothing worse than being dissed by a smug nigga
I have fun with you non-articulate thug niggas
My sarcasm is wasted in conversations
I say shit see the delay and then all I get is a, "What nigga?"
Friends of mine is mad that they never made it
The saddest state of affairs, cause they haven't covered the basics
Go on a couple tours, sleep on a couple floors
When the floors ain't available, there's van seats galore
Transform your biggest haters in to supporters
Then have some of your supporters debate you like you in office
To make it a little awkward, mix your personal with business
That shit done turned angels into witches, I done witnessed
See wherever you run the drama will come to visit
If it never feels like drama then my nigga you got the ticket to this...

[Hook]
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah
See, this is a tangible dream
They try to tell me that it's not and that's apart of the scheme
I can get it, yeah, I can get it, yeah
I can get it, yeah, you know I'm with it, yeah
