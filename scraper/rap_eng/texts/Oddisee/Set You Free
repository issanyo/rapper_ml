[Verse: Oddisee]
We’re living in the age of the microchip
To think real life is like those flicks
We used to watch where the doc was working for the villain to insert shit into your fingertips
The danger is, those flicks desensitized us to the ideas it could exist
Well done Spielberg & Lucas a theory conspired
I don’t know, in the pudding the proof is
But who reads the labels of what they eat
So the readers digest, just what they speak
But who’s they, bigger than the monotheistic belief
That the man is controlling the axes of e-vil
& still all the masses believe, that a masked thief, makes all the madness & grief. We endure, so we indulge ourselves in the idea that wealths the cure, & further more, less ain’t more no more
We assess success like herbivores, More green, more esteem & clout to liberate us from that twenty four hourly bout
Better known as the day to day struggle, no escape from to make one you got to hustle, & that’s where the mistake comes, the tussle
Between fiendn’ out for the dream or the puzzle
That perplexed minds since the beginning of time, Why are we here, do we really have free will. Are we gods, god like or beast still
Did the pharaohs even have it right, in two thousand years, you’d think that we would learn. Can’t take what you earn to the afterlife
Place it in a urn, the body burns liberated from the ideology that to have we like, more than life itself. Man builds rockets to go to the moon but can’t lend hands to the needy in help
It’s them type moves that forever ensure that war glooms
Like a tomb where the battle was held to tell the tale how men turned heaven to hell. Oh well, oh well, you know me well
A common story I came from the bottom to the well
Not quite the top so exaggeration I’m trying to sell
So since we’re building my problems I’m from the basement
No, not my sound, my surroundings, astounding if you found how we dwell
Streets are filled with complacent minimum wages
But faking as if they're making the maximum & it’s breaking their pockets cause uncle sam is just taxing them, & their pockets frail. Yet the streets are unpaved, still the road is rough. Not for motors but their motives, exposed to black kettle & pot-holes, that just be closing up
So hold that thought, Imagine having an accent that would ban you from askin' for a job. You’d react & hold that torch, & burn down opportunities door, the politics of classism is infused with the poor
That’s condusive for a movement or more, that’s a soon to be war
Not sure we’re living in a paradise, more like a resort unaware of life
We alright, we alright, we alright
