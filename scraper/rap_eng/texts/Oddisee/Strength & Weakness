[Verse 1]
I fell asleep with open eyes again
Seeing me how others see me on my mind again
I hope I don't find offence
With people's versions of what I present
I'm not worried but kinda am
I'm slowly learning, most people get me but the side effects
Small percentage of those repelled by all that I project
But that's just life I guess
Can't win em all but I just like the bet
I'm rolling the dice again
I roll to functions full of punks and wish that they feelin' me They clutch their fist reluctantly humbly as to build with me
Discussions over lunches on how they once can appeal to me
Tip another twenty and money don't fit the bill to me
I watch how people move, yeah they work strong
But then physically they vision weak
Smaller print of their truth just appeared to me
But that ain't how I move, I just show and prove
Promotions fill with power man that's power I won't lose

[Chorus]
I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it
Try not to abuse it
I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it
Try not to abuse it

[Verse 2]
What would you do if you knew you could get away with
Anything you wanted to as long as people wanted something from you?
Would you make 'em wait, knowing you could make all of their dreams true in a day
Go and hesitate and let em salivate until they give up and they subdue
Just to demonstrate how long it take until a person break
Power trippin' easy nowadays, nowadays all the
Culture vultures look to bottom feeders for their power plays
Bucket crowded and the crabs fighting
Puppets pick the people on their last legs
Desperate dreamers turn to dirty fiends
Hurting me to see the crowd beg in their loudest moment
Seem too clear to be clouded by those who got it golden
Brass status green could go brown at any sporadic moment
So I stay open, reply to calls, fly or fall, all in all

[Chorus]
I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it
Try not to abuse it
I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it
Try not to abuse it
