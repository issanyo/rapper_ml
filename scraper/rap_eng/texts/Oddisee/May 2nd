CHORUS

Hold your head
Keep that high
Don't chase hoes
Eye on the prize
Don't give up
Make mom proud
Keep your feet on the ground
Head in the clouds

VERSE 1

I'm at a point where I'm needing advice and I can't go to my father
Or the big homies since they don't like being bothered
Unless we talking about their product
Really I ain't bitter
I just got these dreams of these demons pulling triggers
And my nephew is the target and my little cousins
I told them stay in school and I'll make sure they want for nothing
I'm making sure I hug them
They grew up in a time where the shorties all broken 'cause their fathers never loved them
And their mama's always bugging
Teachers lacking patience
Screaming fuck 12 'cause they shooting by the dozens forreal
I'm still trying to recover
It ain't just May 2nd every day I miss my brother forreal
I got some questions only he can answer
Still learning how to be the standard
So he visit me in dreams last night we had a talk and he said
Know I'll always be by your heart my nigga

CHORUS

Hold your head
Keep that high
Don't chase hoes
Eye on the prize
Don't give up
Make mom proud
Keep your feet on the ground
Keep your head in the clouds
My nigga don't give up

VERSE 2

'Cause anything worth having takes time for it to happen
Getting nicer with production plus you working on your patterns
It's crazy where you are G, pardon me for laughing
I just saw you as a lawyer dawg who knew you'd be a rapper
25 with a masters, you are black excellence
If a nigga hate 'cause that's something that they could never get
And you excel in arenas we wasn't supposed to fit
So stick your chest out shorty, learn to boast with it
I know you still working on your confidence
And building your accomplishments while trying to keep it positive
Wait...you in your prime boy they should call you an optimist
I'm hating that I ain't around to rock with this but...

CHORUS

Hold your head
Keep that high
Don't chase hoes
Eye on the prize
Don't give up
Make mom proud
Keep your feet on the ground
Keep your head in the clouds


My nigga don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up
Because the dream getting closer, stay committed, stay focused forreal

Don't give up
Don't give up
'Cause anything worth having take time for it to happen forreal

CHORUS

Hold your head
Keep that high
Don't chase hoes
Eye on the prize
Don't give up
Make mom proud
Keep your feet on the ground
Keep your head in the clouds
