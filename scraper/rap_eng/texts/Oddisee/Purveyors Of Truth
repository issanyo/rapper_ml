[Verse 1 - Uptown XO]
Sidewalks are struggling to absorb my footprints
It's my fault, hustling to be hood rich
To die for? Well, how can I put this?
On your heart, in your eyes, on the charts
Three Feet High, In The Ruff, Midnight Maraud
Three in this tribe too, but we like the Dogan
My thoughts'll murder like Nat Turner
Pick up, and shoot like a fast learner
Born in the Bronx, 'the rebuttal to the Willie Lynch theory
Eventually, three stars collided by Ben's Chili
Keeping it hunnid 'till we celebrate, bicentenni
Hottest in the city,  over Oddisee's symphonies
Sent to me, looking up to God like: This for me?
A gift, custom made like the rod that split the sea
Triple teamed, put it back in balance triple beams
Saved my life 'cuz we was far in Cappers
Shit, and schemes
Gassed up, and [?] down in a Nike box
Hit the cream, feeling prepared, prepared to fail
Shit ain't what it seems, being what you be
The in crowd, they 'gon disagree
But the winning team, Diamond D
Champion rings, this can't be a dream

[Verse 2 - Oddisee]
I learned a lot from the Purveyors Of Truth
Was in the noose until persuaded, I was one of them truths
For the time, being blind, see embettered views
Better eschew, then accuse of being clever, and loose
In the system of getting for self wealth is health
Forget yourself on the mission to else
Can't nothing help
But less is a loss, and a loss like death
For every check is a twelve step addicted to the next
Take a breath

[Verse 3 - yU]
Highly competitive in nature, pockets fatter
Have ya' knockin' down the ladder of your neighbor
Over paper stacked, it ain't even backed by gold
That's some 'ole magician, which hand switched
Blinked, and then you missed it, ha
I guess the hand is quicker than the eye
The poor can't afford to buy, while the rich barely is spending dime
Time spent riding that brittle middle line
While your pockets might determine whether you got your head up high
Got friends who is in jail by selling them little lies
It be them inside, ties could make fraud legitimize
Where some folks income low then they hit 'em high
Don't shake the hand of Uncle Sam, he ain't no friend of mine
A lot in common with them dominate forces
Put our mark on this, go all in and we doing this
Alive and thriving, opposite of that jiveness
District Diamond climbing it's called capitalizing

[Verse 4 - Oddisee]
I learned a lot from the Purveyors Of Truth
Was in the noose until persuaded, I was one of them truths
For the time, being blind, see embettered views
Better eschew then accuse of being clever, and loose
In the system of getting for self wealth is health
Forget yourself on the mission to else
Can't nothing help
But less is a loss, and a loss like death
For every check is a twelve step addicted to the next
Take a breath

Take a breath [X8]
