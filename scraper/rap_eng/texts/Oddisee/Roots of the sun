First Verse :

Wakin' up in the evening feelin' myself blessed
No panic attack when I shoulda feel stressed
The sun comes down no matter how you wanna rest
I work overnight through the shadows of my quest
Overpassing all the doubts I do it for record
Black ink dryin' on my board nothing on my chest
R.A.P. lots of rythms with a few poetry
I wash my bad thoughts but never at the laundry
Sometimes it's tough sometimes it's not so easy
These criminal parents make me feel fuckin' dizzy
I still don't know what to do with so much waifs in this country
We need some real guts for the leaders in a democracy
It's about to crash it's about to blow out
Your life ain't a video game when you fall out
The revolution's on track stakes high for the sellout
Odds up heads down when you spend the night out

Chorus (Acey Ten & Wonderboy) :

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain

Second Verse :

Walkin' through my city with one hand in my pocket
Everythin' but greedy I got a hole on my wallet
The money so green the money so evil
Cream is the motto when stealin' is legal
More profits more taxes for the people
While the rich bitches makin' deals under the table
Hidden by the media, protected by the lawyers
Disappear in the wild like the zodiac killer (Kill ! Kill !)
Untouchable elected elevated as leaders
Got the same scruples than a childish drug dealer
How the fuck can we live in a land like this ?
Ruled by pricks who never give a fuck about peace
Sarkozy, Le Pen, Cahuzac, Cambadelis
I might be actually in trouble only for one diss
Gotta pay like the double a shot fired on ya bitch
Must have failed my whole life with no rolex at my wrist

Chorus (Acey Ten & Wonderboy) :

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain

Third Verse :

Watchin' out the TV when I got boring
Lookin' for some movie but never stops exploring
Switchin' up the channels over and over
With a background sound interrupted by snoring
How to raise a child with so much bullshits at the screen
As the power of learning runs slower than the stream
Tell me whatchu watch and I'mma tell ya who you are
The young blood still believe they have a chance to be a star
With their mind stupefied by reality shows
The future gets dark while the virtuality grows
But don't get pissed off by my mentality, bruh !
These circus freaks got a lack of personality though
Manipulated by heartless, eager producers
Baited with the money by crazy motherfuckers
This ain't gettin' better, prepare for the worst
Start to open up your mind as I finish off my verse

Chorus (Acey Ten & Wonderboy) :

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
It's the roots of sun gettin' tired by the rain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Run around the world with no fear in your brain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain
Free your mind even when your fate is a chain
