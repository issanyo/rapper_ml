So listen
Got your letter ring and sweater
Keys luggage loves such rubbish
Tin hearts golden rules
Silver linings Rusted muse
I guess that I’m a fool for harsh tongues slight abuse
Deuces then I deal your cruel intent with my heavy pen

So I hold tight to truth and I
Slice but not quite through
Cause it's crazy to feel yet I still can’t quite move

I guess I’ve never been the one for rules
When autumns hustling their color through
The cagey sort without a fuse

You told me
You promised
You said that
Our love would be

You got me questioning who I am who I’ve been
Falling for your whims simple minded is my mental dim
You hid inside my M&M mars can’t trust it
Mercury’s all in retrograde I’m so disgusted
I wanna leave this earth today

So I hold tight to truth and I
Slice but not quite through
Cause it's crazy to feel yet I still can’t quite move

I guess I’ve never been the one for rules
When autumns hustling their color through
The cagey sort without a fuse

You told me
You promised
You said that
Our love would be

Suicide, it’s a suicide (repeat)

So I hold tight to truth and I
Slice but not quite through
Cause it's crazy to feel yet I still can’t quite move

I guess I’ve never been the one for rules
When autumns hustling their color through
The cagey sort without a fuse

You told me
You promised
You said that
Our love would be, our love would be...

Suicide, it’s a suicide (repeat)
