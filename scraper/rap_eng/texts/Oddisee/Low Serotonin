[Intro:]
Ugh (ugh), yea
Let’s go
Yea, yea, Ugly Heroes
If you feelin I could take it there
On some One Life to Live shit, up to us to make it there
Up to us to wander off an make it back better
Get in my way, ha

[Verse 1:]
Yea, talkin to ma palm you ain’t heard of me
Man you read the bad books, rhyme bergundy
God burden me wit dis gift, the shoe fits
Wit d first foot mechanical hand you d blueprint
I’m Moses to d people
Celebrate the elevation, hands, I hand the most to d people (waddup)
I propose a toast, I been known to boast a little bit
A little shit can really get it if you don’t
You get to beatin dem drums, I get to speakin in tongues
Pentecostal, get my demons to run
I spit d verse, order first, you can eat when I’m done
You don’t get surfed on ma earth, you can beat for my crumbs-I run it
Second coming like I been in the front
But I function off dysfunction, lots of gossip an assumptions-fuck em
I walking madder, I put in mad work
Plucking dat plant first an leave it wit ma planter

[Chorus:]
If you feelin I could take it there
On some One Life to Live shit, up to us to make it there
Up to us to wander off an make it back better
Get in my way, not ever![x2]

[Verse 2:]
Used to d low serotonin, master of ceremony
Kinda superbad an look like Michael Serratore
Ranch on d hill pour d coke an pill
Pour ma beer wit d half inch head so that I know it’s real
My diction leaves dick prints on foreheads, I’m warhead, ugh, you know Korean war threats
Me an Verbal on that warm up (yea waddup)
Tryna be on more laptops than porn house
I stay focused, y’all lost sight
Raps on a high plane, go fly or force fight
We make moves, smile genuine, you fake tooth
Think you nice must a mistake, think you bought it for Greygoose
Sober up, act like you know what’s up
Every rhyme packed wit fight that’s how you know it’s us
Make no mistake, your career’s what’s at stake
Turn you to who you, you hype man to what’s it’s face, ugh

[Chorus]
