[Verse 1]
One time for setbacks, one time for progress
Have hatred for the matrix or fall in love with the process
Not enough sleep and, way too many prospects
Always feeling fatigue but I have yet to need alarm set
I'm just bout the realest of things, ain't that the logic?
Lie awake with a dream and then fall asleep with a concept
I hear a lot of chatter about hustling on the daily
But when did the discussion come pay me? Never
This the man that's behind the words that do whatever it takes
I'm not too proud to eat the scrapings off plates, turn your nose up
You're missing out, what this about? Having holdups?
Well you can eat the chips on your shoulder, know what?
That ain't something that you can learn, but on the way you could earn
Rode through the fixes and the clenches, never make a U-Turn
And if you do, you ain't ready for what anything cost
Youngin' you soft, run along with your loss and step off

[Chorus]
You ain't got the skills for this. Nah, you ain't got the build for this
Nah, you ain't got the real for this, you ain't got the
Chill for this. Nah, you ain't got the smarts for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, you ain't got the
Ear for this. Nah, you ain't got the tears for this
Nah, you ain't got the fear for this, you ain't got the
Years for this. Nah, you ain't got the heart for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, turn it up

[Verse 2]
When do I not have a lot on my mind
Contemplating what to do with my time
I'm pursuing a grind that runs faster than my passion and I'm
Tryna match it with the habit to shine
Money coming and going
Predict the pattern what I'm tryna define
Already knowing is a tragic decline before the show end
Show up with a "I know what" instead of "why"
The answer ain't in the sky don't expect a reply
I'm just expecting decline, I'm scared to death that
This the best I'ma get before God come and collect his breath back
Lakeen yakhi fluse biad nas Al-muslameen
'Aref al-haqikha gareeb, so I don't sweat that
I got a lot of blessings at stake, and I would hate to take them
All in the vein like I was shooting up base
I'm in the trap you might know it as states
A Murryland boy who wants the world to rejoice at my recording of tapes
Y'all don't hear me why

[Chorus]
You ain't got the skills for this. Nah, you ain't got the build for this
Nah, you ain't got the real for this, you ain't got the
Chill for this. Nah, you ain't got the smarts for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, you ain't got the
Ear for this. Nah, you ain't got the tears for this
Nah, you ain't got the fear for this, you ain't got the
Years for this. Nah, you ain't got the heart for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, turn it up

[Verse 3]
My mother worked the register all the way through her pregnancy
Less than a week from getting me she was working to better me
Pop's selling coke out on Lanny Park in the 70's
He hustled for the struggle to stop the troubles ahead of me
That's when he had a diner off of New Hampshire Ave
Didn't last, Reaganomics set the market to crash
When I'm back home I always make a point to go past
To see the spot as a reminder of how the good could go bad
This the world that I inherited, furthered it through the murderous
Weak, and meager the nervousness, look at me I'm impervious
Take your best shot and make sure that I'm done
Cause if I'm not I'll come back to take the life from your lungs
I fight The Good Fight, the merits of my actions is slow
Overnight: Nothing worth it would grow. This I learned
From the modest of folks, fake artists with your targets
To blow, y'all implode, we ain't guarding your soul
Yeah

[Chorus]
You ain't got the skills for this. Nah, you ain't got the build for this
Nah, you ain't got the real for this, you ain't got the
Chill for this. Nah, you ain't got the smarts for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, you ain't got the
Ear for this. Nah, you ain't got the tears for this
Nah, you ain't got the fear for this, you ain't got the
Years for this. Nah, you ain't got the heart for this
Nah, you ain't got the art for this, turn it up
