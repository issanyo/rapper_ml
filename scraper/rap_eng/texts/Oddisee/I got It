[Hook: Chelsea]
You know I got it
You know I need it
You know you want it
So come and get it baby

[Verse 1: Ronin]
After a long ass day
I'd rather see you in sweats then langerie
I'ma Text you at 5 say I ain't long away
Unless that's too long a wait...
Cuz I could holla at you sooner
I'm living on spooner, street
So when I Peter I swoon her
She my Louis so I'm super
Excited to recruit her To my party
She need a portion of parsley
To garnish the odyssey of her body
She's Godly to me, God lee
We a pod and some odd pea's
I'm like carl sagan and an odd leaf
She my cosmic quandary

Make her pause like she got cammas on
Kama Sutra with no condoms on
You mindless automatons, I'm John the Phenomenon
You mamma prolly saw the signs
Before you did and you clueless, as if
You didn't know that my loose lips
Tongue twist, Titanic, sink ya cruise ship
You move hips, then dip and lose it x2


[Bridge: Ronin]
No flaws at least that I can tell
Her body is and odyssey I know so well

No flaws at least that I can see
Her body is awe and it all is artistry
