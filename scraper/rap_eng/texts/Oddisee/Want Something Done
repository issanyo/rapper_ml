[Hook]
I guess I got to do it all myself
It's not a problem, no
I'm prolly better off without you though
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working

[Verse 1]
I just had another phone meeting
Felt like I was all alone speaking
To the clones keeping, black music soul weeping
I'm a new angel, and they only want the old demons
Glorifying music, that's abusive and a threat to us
And if you got a message in your records
You collecting dust upon the shelf
They selling us components meant to self-destruct
To shelter us in skelter in disguise of something helping us
So I'ma build a bunker now, in the underground
Surviving with that other sound
Clipping magazines, repeating this ain't had to be
Self published, but we're still running for covers now
Imagine me in pageantries, we branded as awards
What's the difference 'tween them auction blocks and cooning for applause
Even selling out, or buying something that you can't afford
It ain't a plan to keep us poor, it's just a plan to be ignored
But um

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should collaborate and record with dudes
Only thing they think  important is some Jordan shoes
Either that or conflicted rebels with sorted views
Are you rapper or reporter with a point to prove?
Don't ask me for assistance in positioning agendas
In the center of attention so your militance remembered
If the cameras ain't in vision you gon mission in your venture to the capitol
With pickets: A mission that never rendered
I'ma help the people close to me
They help the people close to them, and then hopefully
Friends of their friends, friends heed the notion- We
Started off locally, and now it's changed globally
That's the way it's 'posed to be
Single seeds only grow to trees if left alone to breathe
So let's take some time to expose the weeds
Feeding off the roots of the culture vultures are next to you
Convincing you they saving the forest
When they the wrecking crew

[Hook]
I guess I gotta do it all myself
It's not a problem, no
I'm prolly better off without you though
Oh yeah, it's working
I guess I gotta do it all myself
It's not a problem, no
I'm prolly better off without you though
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
Oh yeah, it's working
