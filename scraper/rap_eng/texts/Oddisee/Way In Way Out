[Verse 1]
(Yeah, it go)
One man's trash is another man's treasure
But most men treasure what other men have
Little is thrown away to the many that will never
Grasp what the few view as pennies in the grass
And underneath the grass are the roots of inequality
Creating all the bumps we come across in the path
And I don't have a green thumb and neither do my niggas
And having a money tree is a luxury of class
The only ho I know had a flattering ass
And when I asked could she dig it, she looked at me and laughed
See we crabs in a barrel and the barrel was glass
So we broke, crack was the answer to cash
But the question was never asked, how we get off the path?
Steady walking in a maze that was built in the last
Century, eventually we'll raise our hands
But the teacher is a part of the scam, Goddamn

[Chorus]
Got me looking for a way out, way out, way out
Running down a fire escape to get away
Got me looking for a way in, way in, way in
Got me peeping through your doors and your windows
Got me looking for a way out, way out, way out
Running down a fire escape to get away
Got me looking for a way in, way in, way in
Got me peeping through your doors and your windows

[Verse 2]
I'm a product of the environment that I was brought up in
Material things I'm caught up in
Hustling, a product that creates the production
A plus then, for shackles that resemble circumference
My world, my word, I'm running from my block
Right into your wall, street
That when I see up close is just a prop
Designed to keep me cropped
Outside of the picture that pictures my people in defeat
I'm cooking up the books like a communist bonfire
And tell Uncle Sam I forgot the receipts
He gon' call me a liar and I'ma call him a thief
The jury looking like him and enjoying looking at me
At my arraignment, screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, and a belief in
Religion as the answer to the grieving
Believing that the blessed get test and the less get even

[Chorus]
Got me looking for a way out, way out, way out
Running down a fire escape to get away
Got me looking for a way in, way in, way in
Got me peeping through your doors and your windows
Got me looking for a way out, way out, way out
Running down a fire escape to get away
Got me looking for a way in, way in, way in
Got me peeping through your doors and your windows

[Verse 3]
Running away from trouble got me running into you
Running away from darkness got me running into view
Running towards all the lights
Running from blue and whites
Running for you by day hope I run into you by night
Running for an election to run the country for who?
Run and tell all the news that you run it for something true
Run it into the ground, run it into a tomb
Run until there is nothing, run it until we lose
