[Hook]:
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof

[Verse One] [Kenn Star]:
Okay they gave me the green light
To sing like I'm as hot as a steams pipe
It seem like you the type to hate on the low
You studied my style, I created your flow, it's okay to be dope
Permission granted
Cause either still, see the skills is on a different planet
I didn't plan it, it's just a gift from God
And I'm spittin' hard as liftin' granite
Just the armor
It's just the form like throwback slangs
Kenn Starr, you should know that name
Could ask your broad if she knows that name
And you might get a different answer
Huh, I'm sick as cancer
I'm like the strip club's thickest dancer
The main attraction
Get your hands up
I came attack it, the wackness
To lift the standard
Up to the level where it's supposed to be at
My level, you tryin' to get closer to that
Supposing these cats is the reason you believin' you dope when you wack
Now sing it

[Hook]:
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof

[Verse Two] [Oddisee]:
Dropper of the ill, dollar bill
Get it like a number runner at the bet
100 somethin' real, percentage of the hot, keep it
Your money ain't on me forever you in debt
Forever shoot to kill and the target is the masses
And mark it like matches, promotin' cinematics
In neighborhoods of blackness
Exploitation in the form of noise makin'
Is my occupation in the industry of waitin'
A rather rude awaken-
-ing lightning makes the ding like bells
To let them know the fight is on 'em
We gon' like rebel
Ain't nothin' you can do or say to stop it what you're facin'
You either run with it, under or move adjacent
And we rapid pacin' while you're movin' like snails
I crucify your fakin', usin' music like nails
Trust me, you rusty, you lose and I prevail

[Hook]:
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof
Lower that boom
If the budget ain't low, we gon' lower that too
Show 'em that move
If they act like they don't know we gon' show 'em that proof

[Verse Three] [Sareem Poems]:
I got a different stroll, take a different road
Livin' in an old soul with a different tone
Not tryin' to break a bone tryin' to break the mold
Far from fantasy, this is somethin' you can hold
True story told, mics worth more than gold
Or any amount of money that you can ever fold
Beautiful and bold, chillin' like Chicago cold
Caught you slippin' while whippin' ghost ridin' on a icey road
Follow no code, sleep on them like No Doz
I cherry pick 'em and hard flick 'em like Mogos
Not a Blood, Crip or Cholo, mommy made me solo
We can play el pollo if you wanna act loco
Watch me go go while you lust for the gold ring as Bilbo
Dancin' on you squares flyin' high like the Dodo
Bust hard like the rifle, the truth like the Bible
Giving praise to no man or false idol
C'mon
