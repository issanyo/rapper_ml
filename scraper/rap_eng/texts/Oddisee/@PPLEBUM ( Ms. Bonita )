[ Verse 1 ]

Im slicker than oil escaping the Mach 9
Girl it takes time, so lets go hunting for time
Cuz' you know I'm tryna get it like a boss in his prime
She say she miss the meaner
Just a crime, contemplating just for wasting my time
The doors bright so I entered em
Had to test her waters cuz' it's sharks swimming deep in them
Meetings with em..
Said the draws she debrief em, I'm deep in her, swear I feel off the deep end
So let's go where the road ends
I'ma player so lye in the rhythm til' the night ends
See time we could spend, just amounts of the love
And I seem to get aroused by your heavenly touch
YO BONITA... come spend ya time with a player
A GOLD DIGGER, and a cold heart slayer
They say that ima theif, cuz these hearts I seem to take em'
Cuz' the arts I'm illustrating, got me bound for penetration
A cheif with the reefa with a stoke of a genius
Phony rappers teased em with the mind behind the tweezers
Walking in her cleavage as her waters get to rising
Now I'm in a tide tryna swim to the surface

[Hook]

Yooo Bonita...
I'm tryna get between ya
Turn off all the lights til' the peeps can see us
But she stay bright, tryna get my mind right
Skip talking girl I'm on for the night(night)
Girl on for the night(night) (2x)
I'm in ya arms for the night....

[ Verse 2 ]

Meditating as the thoughts infuriates us..
Back and forth like great debaters
Creating.. karma sutra for her massive mind
See I'm reckless way I'm beating the spine
So get with the shine cuz' im snatching all of the lights
So get with the times like back in the days
You can tell I mean business way I'm filling em J's
Said the game got em speechless like its all they can say
Cuz my flows blow minds like a hand grenade, with wonderful taste
Shawty got a wonderful taste
I could tell the way she want it from the look in her face
Tryna get me tied up like laces, my heart is adjacent
But closed after sun rays show
So take it slow and i'll ignite like TNT
See I'm putting on a show like TNT
So are we gonna kick it til' the sun rays show..
The waters seem indigo, so I'm ready to float

[ Hook ]

[ Outro ]

Baby, you so good to me
We in the books, they just history
So get the mist of me...
Browse my love... check the history..
Now I guess we just fucking history.. PIFF !!!

ONLY FOR THE NIGHT.. (4X)
