[Hook: Oddisee]

Now what's crazy in a world that spins and nobody gets dizzy?
We all get busy, c'mon
That means that we all in the plan that man can't see and we all ?
I mean I've seen all types of things;
Bright lights and skies not light with ?
Thing bump at night, that's mighty strange
Some things we believe we ain't gotta explain. (We ain't gotta explain)

[Verse 1: Oddisee]

I can't explain why I do what I do
Sometimes my mind just parouse through a slew of
Unkind, thoughts, buried in the dark of my
Mind and sometimes require some sunshine
Ying-Yang, big change, just to come
Back to mistakes that been made
This place; lessons learned the first time around
Counter-Clockwise the first time I'm found
Nothin' is there that wasn't there in the first place
Me, I'm a Pisces: blame it on my birthday (yep)
I'm gettin' attitude; (yep)
I'm in and out of moods;
And treat people close to me in the worst way
And I know that's wrong but I can't stop
Like ? In the background fucking up the song
And that's big, big of me to admit
I got a problem that I can't even fix

[Hook: Oddisee]

Thing bump at night, that's mighty strange
Some things we believe we ain't gotta explain. (We ain't gotta explain)

[Verse 2: J-Live]

Now what's crazy in a world where
Just when you thought it couldn't happen
Black kids playin' golf; white kids rappin'
Now we got the first black first family
New meanin' to the ? heard by M.O.P
Guess now white folks abuse the black cops
Cab drivers don't know for whom they might stop
Underground, gold, platinum and the pop flop
Walmart takin' over bomb Mom and Pop shops
Not quite but you never know what's next
Book a flight to Mars and drive here in your cars
A new dance that'll cure cancer
Push a button on your pen when you don't know the answer
And pardon me, my mind wanders in the worst way
Also a Pisces, blame it on my birthday
Ten dollars and change, we all so thirsty
So insane when we stay insane

[Verse 3: Stik Figa]

Daddy raised a man, and men, they don't cry
Until the wheels fall, believe we gonna grind
I've been livin' in the dark so maybe I won't die
Don't wanna grow up so baby I'm gonna fly, away
As far as possible and just escape
I've still got lots to lose, just today
So what's been stoppin' you ? this money
So what's it costin' you?
I gotta navigate, ?, and course through the obstacle
Guess it can't wait when the clock is watchin' you
Age in my face and I'm faced with the ugly news:
Ugliness done took shape in every space and molecule
That's my life; I'm the one that gotta live it
Without any regret or apology when it's finished
That's my life; I'm the one that gotta live it
Without any regret or apology when it's finished
You dig it?
