[Verse 1: Oddisee]
You were there from the start
Taught me to be aware of the sharks and prepare for the dark
You kept a secret you practiced what you were preaching against
Your inner demons were praying I'd tear apart
You won't admit but you competed just a little bit
I could tell, you'd be heated over little shit
Telling me to quit trying and get real
I got a little shine you was like big deal
I was pursuing dreams, steady doing my thing
You wasn't doing the same, you wasn't doing a thing
From my truest to a Brutus to a Judas
To who knew that this could happen
But the fracture was brewing it seems
I should have seen, mistaking smoke for a little steam
It turned to fire you burned me, trying to ruin me
I won't even mention your name in my bars
It's too close to the scars, but I'm sure that

[Hook: Oddisee]
You know who you are
You know who you are
I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are
I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are
I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are
You know who you are

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
You were there from the start
You told me what ever I'm doing to do it from the heart
I was pursuing a dream that was cloaked in the cloth of the uncertain
Making money, music, and art, and it wasn't perfect
You told me whatever's worth it was worth hurting
Double edge seemingly sharp, rather unnerving
Still, you believed in a brother
I was starving as an artist, you was feeding a brother
You could see in a brother what I couldn't see myself
When I couldn't see myself needing help
One reason or other I was trying through it all
Lot of ways to fail, that's the fastest way to fall
And through it and after all, you was with me not against
Cheered me from the bench, now you're with me as I ball
And that meant, I ain't even mention your name in my bars
You know you're close to my heart
I'm sure that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
You were there from the start
Before you were even aware of the plan you were part
Of the scheme grand, as it could seem at the top
Man can only go so high before he reaches where he can't breath
But you know your limitations, you walk patient
While everybody start running for their plan B
Like a fire escape, but you stay in the kitchen
Let them sleep on they dreams, you stay lying awake
You stay eyeing the cake, they say you getting greedy
And then they turn their side against you like they getting sleepy
Try to convince you but you ain't into what they about
Get in your mental prevent you to take the way out
Please, let 'em try, let 'em fail
Let em tell lies on you, let 'em be
Let em see you prevail
Let em bail on they attempt to stunt a star
In any event be sure that

[Hook]
