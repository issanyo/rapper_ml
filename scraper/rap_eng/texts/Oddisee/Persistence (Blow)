(Intro: J-Alta)
Hands Tied, Hands Tied
Alta!
Carolina what up, hey

(Verse 1: J-Alta)
Got the ceiling fan spinning like my mind do
What you gotta do to make these record labels sign you
Looking at the stars like yo one day I'ma shine too
But in Carolina tell me how they gon find you
I'm grinding though, I'm  idolizing the life of rhyming
And it's so surprising, our role models in Rikers Island
And still they shining, back against the wall, still reclining
Like a signing from Hov, I know I'ma get some diamonds
Eventually, these bars are free, can never sentence me
Because all of my time is in the grind
Late nights, all my friends tryna party with hotties
But that was not me I was tryna find a beat to body, to rock the
Shows, the flows, the glow, and soon I'll get the
Clothes, the hoes, the dough, I'll ball out like the
Pros, with rows, like Rose, are you watching?
Here I go, you know I'm about to blow, that's fa shoo

(Hook: J-Alta)
Know I"m about to, blow, persistence
Yea I keep on trying I ain't failing on my mission
Know I'm about to, blow, persistence
Something that is fueled by the presence of ambition
Know I'm about to, blow, will I stop oh will I stop, oh no no no no
You know I"m about to, blow, persistence
Yea I keep on trying I ain't failing on my mission, now listen

(Verse 2: J-Alta)
And I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Tired of being broke, should I go and blast for wealth
Filled with this annoyance, my loved ones get avoidance
Dealing with unemployment I can't be a disappointment
I know my calling tho, it's in this music thing
I put my headphones on I just get these music dreams
Like one day it's no more open mics it's more arenas
And I ain't fucking no more average hoes, it's only divas
And I don't gotta hit the club before 11:30
I just show up and ball out like I wear a jersey
It's just the fantasies of a broke visionary
Like one day Ima be on top no missionary
Imagination running wild, tryna reach the skies
I'm just tryna make it while my grandma still alive
That's gods gift , I ain't stopping on my mission
And when I'm there I'm saying how's that for persistence

(Hook: J-Alta)
Know I"m about to, blow, persistence
Yea I keep on trying I ain't failing on my mission
Know I'm about to, blow, persistence
Something that is fueled by the presence of ambition
Know I'm about to, blow, will I stop oh will I stop, oh no no no no
You know I"m about to, blow, persistence
Yea I keep on trying I ain't failing on my mission, now listen

(Outro: J-Alta)
Hey, yea, vibe with me
Know I'm about to, blow, persistence
Something that is fueled by the presence of ambition
Know I'm about to, blow, will I stop oh will I stop, oh no no no no
Know I"m about to, blow, persistence
Something that is fueled by the presence of ambition, now listen, Alta
