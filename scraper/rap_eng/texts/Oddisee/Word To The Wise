[Hook]
Running red lights cause there's nobody around
No one to hear my speakers, do they even make a sound?
Preaching to the choir, no one is there to see it
I don't talk about change, I just try to be it
That's word to the wise, word to the wise
That's word to the wise, word to the wise
That's word to the wise, word to the wise
That's word to the wise, word to the wise

[Verse 1]
You ever tried to bring some people with you
To a place you tryna get to
And all along the way that you cut a clearing
They sharpenin' sticks spearing to get you
And throwing at a rate that is faster than they'll forget you
I got a couple round me surrounding this very moment
Fear not I'm in the know of exactly who holds the pistol
Well here's a message for you if you're listening
I am the one that gave you the gun that's why you missing
And you can take your turn and check your engine
You, I gave you your start
A super monster only ended you, now go play your part
As I watch know-it-alls try to roll with the art
They going nowhere, no one know us we're smart
Prolly not, cause who really learns their lessons
Not mad at our own deceptions
Just angry cause we had in possession to holding weapons
Toss that burner and no further are you from a cause that turned you to a loss
Self murder, go!

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
I just found a pot to piss in
A lot was missing till the options started popping
Kicked in, the door like I wasn't ready for intruders
To a house made out of mirrors with glass ceiling illusions
Might have begin to tear up, might have begin to tear up
My nose start to flare up, I'm not afraid of improvement
I'm at the intersection where all lights are green
Yet I'm only seeing red cause my anger's got a direction
Driving into a tree, I'm colliding right into me
And surviving to tell the tale, how this rhyming comes into be
It's the process yeah, I do the knowledge yeah
You get to witness my exhibit for a modest fee
But your interpretation keep it to yourself though
Because how you think I'm feeling how I felt though
Try to tell me about me as if I ever doubt me
Whole time I never been without me
You see? Go!
