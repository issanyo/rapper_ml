[Verse 1]

A lot of roads, a lot of paths I done came
Or i have traveled down and don't see shit the same
It's been quite thee amount of people that I've helped through-Out this game
And if you ask em' bout it, I guarantee they'll start looking a you Strange; like nah
If anything they'll probably throw dirt on my name
God bless em'
And if i fuck with you, you know it, man, ain't no need to guess it
If you owe me money my nigga you good It ain't no need to Stress it
My money straight, got everything I need in my possession
Thank God for the blessings, the recessions, my progression
Or even when I regressed that just set me up for my success
I don't ask a lot of questions
When He say move
I take them steps
Feed my faith and starve my doubts
Nigga thats the whole point of the lesson
I came up, them niggas lessened
I caught a lick then I Invested, in some new kicks and some Laces
Cause myself is who I'm racing
Take yo' time, but not too much
They might just think you being complacent
And have a plan, cause saying prayers can't excuse preparation

[Chorus A]

Where would I be?!
Where Would I  (5x)
Where would I be without my love for this game
The blood that's running through my veins
When I think from where I came
I don't how I could complain
Where would I Be?

Where would I  (5x)
Where would I be
Without my family or my partner's
These dollars in my pocket
Don't know how I could accomplish
What i've done, so I'm asking
Where would I be, be be

[Verse 2]

Before the song end, man, somebody gone get a break-though
Trying to pop? Break them locks, do whatever you need to Break through
Shoot it open, pry it off, rip the door from off the hinges
Switch yo team, adjust the way your viewing shit through both Your lens
Use your brain, fuck your heart
Nigga your heart can be deceitful
What you feel ain't always right
And what's fair ain't always equal
Man we started from the bottom and went to the top of the Steeple
And while they was rolling with a gang, I just had the right Amount of people:
Me, myself and God
I'm lying nobody does this shit alone
Cause if you're destined for it, I guarantee you'll have some Help along
The way, but wait, look they will hate, and say you ain't'. gone Make
Or take, the weight and face the snakes, erase
And chase embrace where you end up nigga
Stopping ain't a choice, failures not an option
Nigga, this how I feel
It's all on you whether you adopt it
Pray for em when they hate you
Bless em' when they curse you
Keep your faith
But know your faith can never excuse hard work
It's Gerald Walker, nigga

[Chorus B]

Where would I be?!
Where Would I? (6x)
Without my pride and my ambition
When they hate and I didn't listen
Stayed true to my position
Got me asking myself nigga
Where would I Be?

Where Would I? (6x)
Without this spirit in my body
My cousin Akbar in that lobby
With that .45 and that shotty
Ready to blast on everybody
Where would I be, be be

[Break] (music plays)

[Chorus A]

Where would I be?!
Where Would I  (5x)
Where would I be without my love for this game
The blood that's running through my veins
When I think from where I came
I don't how I could complain
Where would I Be?

Where would I  (5x)
Where would I be
Without my family or my partner's
These dollars in my pocket
Don't know how I could accomplish
What i've done, so I'm asking
Where would I be, be be
