[Verse 1]
Motivated by fear, it ain't the best but it works for me
Being like the rest is like the worst to me
Know that I have ideas, and I'm trying to bring them to life
But no plan is executed perfectly
My niggas wanna travel, the world they wanna see
But they don't own a jet, so they think it ain't meant to be
My niggas love to drink, they smoke a lotta weed
I told them if they saved what they were blowing they could flee
This a tangible dream, Nas said it ain't hard to tell
But I'm the one on this beat, Odd said it ain't hard to reach
Manifesting destiny I'm making that my specialty
I'm chef'ing up a recipe I'm trying to get the best of me
Lesser me ain't worthy of existing in the present
That nigga had me messing with some shit that had me stressing
The future me done been through everything that I'm expecting
He told me, holler at me in the past to get a lesson, okay

[Chorus]
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I know I'm (Ready for tomorrow)

[Verse 2]
Right now I'm chilling, later on, the same
No, I can't complain, right now I'm winning
Killing's what I'ma make, for the sake of living
Taking it to the top, no I'ma own all the building
Found a woman I love, I'ma give her some children
What she gives me is great, she's my friend and my mate
I'ma repay the feeling, intertwining our fates
Put a ring on her finger, no bouncing on her I ain't
Growing up is hard as fuck, dodging it, yeah my guard was up
Gotta take some jabs if you want to handle a harder punch
Quick to knock you down if your outer's sound, but your heart is mush
Not enough to talk if your bite ain't as tough as your bark
Use to love the past, loath the present, hate the future
Guess I just got used to rolling with it like a trooper
Ceilings made of glass are in the scope of what I shoot for
And when I get it to crack, another level is the new goal

[Chorus]
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I know I'm (Ready for tomorrow)

[Verse 3]
You see me running towards the sun
Being burnt out's the only way I know I'm done
I got to take a break I'm still awake it's after one
But what I do ain't work it's all in fun. But keeping it
That way is where the secret is, deeply hidden from tons
The lucky few to peep it, I'm among. Never take for
Granted opportunities I'm handed, and if it's within my
Means, I go above what I was planning. I walk along the
Line between manage and panic, frantically working
Sometimes relaxing is the challenge. You see I make these
Beats in my computer though, writing in my phone so
Everywhere I go is like my studio. Always feel at
Home when roaming around the planet, a road is just a
Road, the traveler that makes the vantage. My future's looking
Good and my present's in good standing. My past is in the
Past, so I think I'm ready for tomorrow today

[Chorus]
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
No, it ain't nothing left to say, no it ain't
Nothing left to say, I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I think I'm (Ready for tomorrow today)
I know I'm, I know I'm...
