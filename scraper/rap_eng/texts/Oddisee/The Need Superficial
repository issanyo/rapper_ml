[Verse 1:]
Hot dance on... of the start
On my sleeves I was wearing my heart
My beliefs I was tearing apart
She was my religion, another clear as the art
I idolized her, I demised her
Fiend for the esteem, must creep and supply her
For I too one to blame that I used her
The few words lyrical claim I’m not a looser
To walk next to her, you’d understand
To be a man, most important you would have to throw a check to her
A mean...the food off the mike that I hit
When robbers a jewel off, the side of the chick that I’m with
Excites the words that describe that you’re next to something
That’s desire
To posses require contention
I need her in my life, so see I confessed it

[Hook:]
Superficial, super love, yeah
Superficial, super love, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Yo, yo, yo, look most thangs being chased on wanna be
But she keep a pace where her face stay in front of me
What a great catch, don’t let it get near
My biggest thing that my interest will disappear
I ain’t escaped yet, but in time
I’ll find something to climb for the challenge a bit...
Sweet nothing’s in the air of my next here
My dear in the making I make tear
From the faces of beauty I turn ugly
I want you to want me to be unclear
So good, you’re caught in, and you’re deep
And I ain’t quite perfective, I’m just move it
Steady deceiving myself, believing
I ain’t living for somebody else
It’s a cycle that it just can’t get you
I love you right now, go superficial

[Hook: x2]
