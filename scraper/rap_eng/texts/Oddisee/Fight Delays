[Verse: Oddisee]
They told me this ain't where the money at
It's funny that I heard that mess when I was coming back
From another sale they tell me I ain't buzzin' welp
Last year I made well over a hundred stacks
I'm sure it's better to know than to show
But it's hard to stay humble in the jungle as a alpha male
Too much romance and not enough real
Maybe that's just how I feel about the program
The old soul meets the old man
On the road less traveled, they been waitin' for a conversation
The wait is over, they catchin' up
Back it up, had enough, taking over

[Outro]
That's it right there
Naw it was just twelve bars
Naw, that was it cut it right there
