Hey yo
Keep going

I'm back at it like I ain't just drop a classic
I think talent is habitual a habit I contract it
With residuals to match it I'm a cactus in the desert
So when other start to perish I flourish where it's difficult
Weird to imagine my ?Awankin? to mash shit
I do my best between the power and the practice
Money under, women on top the mattress
Use my bed for many things but sleeping ain't on the ballot
O marks the spot an unorthodox shot
Heard around the world it started in the parking lot
I'm talking ciphers dead shot my shit is mean
Off the top Maximilian guillotine
Viva la revolution I'm all about execution
The fruits of my labor gravitate to me I'm next to Newton
Study signs while God studies me
According to my calculations we're going to meet somewhere between
Where, we'll see?

I set a course to operate without remorse
Regret restraint but none of them I resort
I guess I think I'm living life with the force
A jet a tank fly nigga untouchable
I'm living good in Brooklyn currently, Huxtable
Well deserved I was a trouble youth
In a sense my lack of innocence provided me another route
Ain't many problems I can't troubleshoot
Now I'm stable got a label rocking labels that you pay to
I'm able to speak the truth through music not a fable
I'm making shit you relate to worry and celebrate to
That make you wanna do better than just make do
Grateful my struggle synonymous with my hustle
So when fans enjoy to see so much their versing through the puddle
A lake view eye on the storm find miss under the duvet supplying the warmth
I call her Tahoe

A lot of speculation on the money I've made
How is it I'm paid
If I'm seldom ever heard on the radio or played
Intelligent hustler eggs no basket
Means you all be digging me forever no casket
This is built to last shit in common with my fabrics
Cut from the same cloth a nigga stay matching
Dabbling in fashion but my focus on rapping
Amateur photographer for art I have a passion
In all forms for me it's all norm
