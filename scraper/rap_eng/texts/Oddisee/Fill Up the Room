[Intro]
I ain't a singer, y'all, I just rap a lot

[Hook]
Bet that when them hoes come
Bet that when them hoes come
They fill up the room
Fill up the room
Bet that when them hoes come
Bet that when them hoes come
They fill up the room
Fill up the room, feel like it's June
Cause we hot
Girl, you know we hot
Show me where the weed at
Show me where them trees at

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know we hot, on fire
Got that weed, let me get my lighter
Cause I'm blazing
(Ooh, you know I'm blazing)
And I know it's late, but we ain't tired
Guess I'll sleep when we retire
And I made it
(Girl, you know I made it)

[Pre-Hook]
I ain't trying to fuss, I just wanna chill and
Get them dollar bills, yeah, get them dollar bills, yeah
I ain't trying to fuss, I just wanna chill and
Get them dollar bills, yeah, get them dollar bills, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know we ain't no lames
And that bass gon' bang
When we play it
(Ooh, it's so amazin')
And her body's off the chain
So you know a nigga trying to get that brain
I can't take it
(You know I can't take it)

[Pre-Hook & Hook]
