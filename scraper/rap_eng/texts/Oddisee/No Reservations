[Verse 1]
If I could make time, I wouldn't make nothing else
I feel like with time, anything would probably make itself
Evolution or incentive, I'm just trying to grow to the point that my interests
Are taken care of by my interest
Then I take into account that I'm preparing an account to take care of me in the distance
Know a lot of homies that ain't got no plans
Know a lot of ladies that ain't got no mans
They'll settle for each other like they got no chance
I ain't saying that you need a dude, nah, no ma'am
Use ma'am, understand you is not no grand
'Scuse me for being rude, know it sounds so crass
But political correctness ain't my program
I'm P.G., I was raised 'round a high-low class
Young, got me feeling like a dinosaur
I'm coming from an era where we knew each other's business
But like diamonds in the ore we just mined it more
They say that real becoming harder to find
Good news, mean a lot of you is probably dying
Or moving out the city cause of all the property buying
Let alone cover rent for the crib each month
So you can move to L.A. where you can still cheap stunt
Can I get a witness?
Black entrepreneur here, can I get some business?
Taking out a loan, not asking for-givness
Just take away the stone, hard place wasn't lifting
Cause it landed on me, I ain't land on it
Grandma never cussed like daggone it
Frustrated free, I'm picking locks
Cause time still sitting in a box

[Hook]
I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way
I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way

[Verse 2]
And I've been up late, thinking I should move upstate
Get a farm in the middle of a town called Nowhere sounding like enough space
But I like culture so near it grabs me
Agriculture I'd do it gladly
I think the answer is a loft in the middle of the city and the roof where the plants be
Let's grow, hustle real hard knowing nothing come easy
Party on the boulevard well let's go
I'ma take a rain check knowing any minute that the warm front ending and we all get snow
I ain't make the laws but I am trying to break them
And not get caught by the criminals that make them
Funny that the boss gets a pardon and the Sargent get absolved when the evidence blatant
A'salaam alaikum I'm just trying to get a peace from the patience of a saint in the belly of the beast
And the lowest in the rank think the hardest in the tank
But we seldom get the credit so we never get the lease
Sleeping on the streets be the same ones paving
Walking on slaughter and the water ain't free
Floating with the attitude of y'all ain't me
And I had it just as bad as you and now I made it
Well that's great then, though
Your triumph ain't erasing what I'm facing, so
Get up out my face with the conversations bout how you can relate then no
I'm the trenches, I'm riding on the train
Local shop owners here, I probably know their names
Surviving on the streets doing something like me
What you doing, man, nothing this week

[Hook]
I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way
I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way

[Outro]
I don't make easy to follow
Cause when I'm easy they come come round and they come see me to borrow
They don't give props up, they pot holes
So around them how I go
Had that happen a few times for me to view signs
Now quickly I know
Now quickly I know
Yeah this King Odd
Writer of the rhythm with the pristine bars
Keep it hard for me to ever see a loss
I'm only getting better while the rest peel off
This solid, not plated
Barter at the market that you'll never get away with
Your loss
I'm the favorite of your favorite
Ask him, wait for the reaction, and
He'll cough
