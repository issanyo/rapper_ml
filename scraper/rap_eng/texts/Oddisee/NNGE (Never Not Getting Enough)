[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I mean what is there to fear?
I'm from black America, this is just another year
If you're new to disrespect by your elected puppeteers
Well let me show you how to persevere
Just get up every time somebody knock you down
And celebrate in front of people like they not around
And if they try to build a wall to keep you balling out of bounds
Use the bench they told you to warm to keep the fences knocking down
Shout out to latinos because hustling ain't illegal
We praying to the east or the father, we all are equal
But if parted they gon' progress in stopping us getting C-notes
Well let me ask the crowd, do one of y'all disagree?
This is for Chocolate City though I represent the county
Until your vote is counted, know I got you until I'm outy
It's all about the effort and I'm effortlessly fresher
If I'm preaching to the choir, know they're bound to get the lecture
It went from folks around me, pushing envelopes and boundaries
So you won't only hear me where you found me
I'm somewhere asking questions like "Can I be afforded the most?"
You better answer me with more than a "no"
Tryin' tell ya

[Chorus]
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
This is for the county and the areas surrounding
DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you

[Verse 2: Toine]
What are you willing to let die first:
Your pride or your freedom?
The story of my life's inner conflict
It's like I follow my dreams
But how am I supposed to slide in the DM
On this mic, is what I'm trying accomplish
I used to do it for the fist bumps and applauses
But caring about respect started making me nauseous
You walk into a room, and bammas speak to you cautious
Like employees trying to figure out who the boss is
So now I just kick it for, the most divine
Working overtime
Sitting with an open bottle, looking for an open mind
Trying not to be aggressively jaded
Because I find myself just getting faded
And I know that ainâ€™t quite me
I step up for whatever it might be
And RSVP when inspiration invite me
Because who else gonna look out for those who look like me Another disenfranchised boy in a white tee?
Come on, man!

[Chorus]
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
This is for the county and the areas surrounding
DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you

[Verse 3: Oddisee]
All I know is love
I give it how I get it, I can never get enough
Sympathy to enemies 'cause hate ain't in my blood
And if you can't relate you've given up
I'm trying to make the most of it though
Getting close is a no
Want nothing lesser than a yes because it's suppose to be so
The cost of nothing's too low
My expectations too high
I'd rather die than be complacent with the way that it goes
Apathy is a disease and we're just steady sharing needles
Unaffected people carry evil
Ease is what we know
We've got to raise the bar though
The sorrows of today will give away to a tomorrow
So what's a week of paid leave
And empty promises of hiring
Just to fire me before retirement
I'm trying to make more in one day than 401K
So give me what you promised to pay
Because it's never enough

[Chorus]
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like
This is for the county and the areas surrounding
DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you
