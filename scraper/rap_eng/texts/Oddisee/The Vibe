[Intro: Oddisee]

Yeah, better late than never, Audible Doctor what's up man?
It's Oddisee on the rhymes, I'm gonna let somebody else handle the production real quick on this one
This beat is hot homie...

[Verse 1: Oddisee]

[Verse 2: The Audible Doctor]

The verse phenomenal
I regurgitate words from the abdominal to serve you birds like ya mama do
You nerds should fly the coup
When Audible hop in the booth the lesson learned he hot enough to burn your molecules
In black and white your dog acting funny like Marmaduke
But I'mma do whatever to sever the paws of lying crews
You swallow garbage I try to follow the tried and true cuz
You just another obstacle to power through what
You think I give a flying fuck about your weak flow?
Keep the nine son hand me a rhyme and I'll defeat foes
You fucking noobs ain't no cheat code to beast mode
Doc'll drop you whole block from the shock off of each quote
I preach dope, try to give them what they missing
And spit crack, get them hooked on lines is the mission
So get back, perform and leave them torn from the diction
So their baby's born with the vibe already in their system
Like that

[Verse 3: Hassaan Mackey]
