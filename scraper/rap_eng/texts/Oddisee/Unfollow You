[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I wonder why I follow you
We ain't really friends just pretend
If these walls came down bet our pants would follow suit
Know you got a man but then again I only know because a message that you wrote that I responded to
I'm digging you and it's more than just physical
Can't describe it in written form
All I know is I'm fond of you
And if I had a chance I would take it
I know your feelings are adjacent so quit your faking, you're on it too
Lets rendezvous
Meet you down in the city lets grab some coffee you with it
Than it's a date & we on a two
Damn it, I didn't plan it, you naked
This vantage point is the greatest
I'ma embrace lets form a group
Living within the moment, dismissing patience, tensions building, break it, no delaying, we over due
I'm holding you, dear to me, near to me
Is where you should be
I want you, you want it too
Lets just do what we're gonna do

[Hook: Oliver St. Louis]
Ooh baby, I'm taking you for a ride
Cause you wanted me, lady, and I've wanted you, I'm not gonna lie
And it's so wrong, and it's all the same
Just cause we'll never make mistakes
And I know it's calling you
???????
And I'm struggling, I gotta unfollow you


[Verse 2: Oddisee]
We've been dating now for a while
Is this serious or we're pals
With agreements to come around when the sun is down
Another moon in my room guess it's safe to assume
You're out when the sun is back, you'll be back for another round
I work from home, I'm around
I ain't doing shit except for you and some music
Girl you my muse, you another sound
Like of it, love it we ain't rushing the discussion on what we are is due, but we shut it down
We're only human, what we're doing
Got an ending for now we're pretending that it don't so lets fuck around
Let hit the fan till we can't stand each other
One of us fall in love but we don't want it now
We do it, in the moment fully knowing this ain't cool but we're fools for each other, so we something now
Good while it lasted, we turned my bed to a casket no longer under covers now we're underground

[Hook]
