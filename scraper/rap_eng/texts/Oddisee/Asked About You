[Verse 1]
These are good days for bad people, sad sequel
To a unrated story 'bout the underrated, told
By the makers of the evil and still I'm lining up to get a preview
Glory to the most wise, we came here on boat rides, wavy
Yet the ground beneath us seeming bone dry
How much for a maybe? How much for a know why
Cost an arm and leg to get ahead and you get no eyes
Shades on at night can't bring the light, I see the demons
That hang around us on evenings and party with us on weekends
Ain't numb enough, so I'mma keep the sleeping pills on tables
I count on them to counter all the fables I believe in
Cause I just want to keep on dreaming but dreams are for suckers Attracted to your tears, sweatin', bleedin'
Grew a pair of fangs, called a brain left and right
I'm hungry and my bark far lesser than my bite

[Hook]
I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?
I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?

[Verse 2]
I'm far more concerned with the cause
Although it's the effect that is receiving the applause, or uproar
Either way it's hands up like a yep y'all
And I'm just trying to get down to the bottom of a rut wall
Giving faces to the hatred, trying to figure out the bases of humanity's disgraces
If I'm not mistaken, a Roman and a German met a Viking
On an island that was occupied by Britons
They became the British after fighting
And they merged into a Titan
That became really good at killing white men
Somebody thought it smarter to do it to people darker
Until now we harbor what was docked at the harbor

[Hook]
I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?
I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?
