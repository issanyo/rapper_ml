[Intro]
The main focus for my music, whether it be the production or the lyrics is
My travels, you know, the outside environment really plays a huge part in what I make
I write all my rhymes outside, you know
Every city I go to I set up my studio in the hotel, I make the beats during the day, I start coming up with ideas
And I just hit the streets and start walking and whatever I see really just kind of inspires me
It may not be literally but it always finds its way into my music
The streets, the city is my main inspiration

[Verse 1]
I never asked to be born, and death's no question
The sun's still shining off the same old lessons
Then why does life feel like an educated guess and
My thoughts like meals I'm a sucker for the seconds
Impressions got a lot of us stressing
But how we are perceived is more about a reflection
And the perception's warm that I receive
Which leads to believe these hoes like what I heave
Tall women in heels, tour money and deals
Man off the no bull I like all money for real
More time abroad and less time at home
Less time for broads and more time in zones, yeah
I'm in it while flying out of another one
This a new beginning, I'm climbing out of the other one
'Cause the dream feel real'er than it ever been
And I was aiming high like a nigga being president
The possibilities of that are seeming pretty evident
So being self employed is now seeming like a definite
But staying that way is what I'm F'ing with
And like minded people be the only ones I'm messing with

[Hook]
Ayo this so real
Not knowing what's ahead but I'mma go there still
Living in the moment got a hopeless feel
But the feeling in itself got its own appeal
I know, I'm attracted to the lights in the distance
The closer that I get and the brighter my wish gets
Excited by the risk and the chances I'm taking
Not sure what I'm putting my faith in but I'mma be
Alright

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to get mine in this lifetime
The afterlife is much further in the pipeline
I'm in inclined to believe that but truth is
That for death, any moment is the right time
So I live like everyday it's my last
But I plan for tomorrow as if I will never pass
A Pharaoh on the subway who never had dreams of jets
But fell asleep on runways, I just know that one day
That anything I needed I could mold
Get everything you want it ain't always good for the soul
A mix of self worth, some help, little control
And I don't know the rest, good as mine is your guess
The recipe ain't the best, to make it though is our quest
And if you choose to accept, the meaning of life is yes
(yes, yes, yes, yes) Cause only God knows
Those of us in the flesh, get the privilege to test and
Some will fail and some will pass. We all get the
Same grade though when we run the path, but how you grade
Yourself is the mark that will matter most to separate
The heart of the strong and the battered folks, have a dose

[Hook]
Ayo this so real
Not knowing what's ahead but I'mma go there still
Living in the moment got a hopeless feel
But the feeling in itself got its own appeal
I know, I'm attracted to the lights in the distance
The closer that I get and the brighter my wish gets
Excited by the risk and the chances I'm taking
Not sure what I'm putting my faith in but I'mma be
Alright

[Verse 3]
Ayo, shit so real
Kill shit to live nigga, schizo feel, I got a
Hunger for knowledge and I miss no meals, I stay
High off life and I miss no pills
I'm addicted to the thrill of walking along the edge
Not knowing what lies ahead but always knowing the deal
I'm good with my decisions, the set backs and gains
Is all a part of the game, I'm ready to spin the wheel
What ever is in store, I'm ready for it, for sure
With the attitude of wealth and the gratitude of the poor
The balance is the challenge and I sit so still between
Callus and analysis but this no frills, I'm off the
Chain, been that way since slaves to Flav from
93 till infinity I'm slated in ways that's
Etched in stone, the age where we market ourselves
I'm still all about the music, I don't monitor plays
I don't monitor hits and I don't monitor clicks
I monitor the snare drum and the bottom of kicks
Is anybody left that still fuck with this true shit
Well let me hear you scream over top of this CRU shit

[Hook]
Ayo this so real
Not knowing what's ahead but I'mma go there still
Living in the moment got a hopeless feel
But the feeling in itself got its own appeal
I know, I'm attracted to the lights in the distance
The closer that I get and the brighter my wish gets
Excited by the risk and the chances I'm taking
Not sure what I'm putting my faith in but I'mma be
Alright
