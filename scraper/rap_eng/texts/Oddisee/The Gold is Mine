Take a seat in any city I know spots to eat
The rougher side of town im around a less is proper bleak
Made it Paris without the use of a private jet
Check in an Ibis yet check me out im the flyest yet
They exhibitionist still we both in the exhibition
For them to be seen and for me to see the collection listen
Most of my people theyre missing out on the point of living
To be rich or enriched is our own decision
Prone to the latter but most of my people isn't
They focus different they tend to see me as broken vision
Man, look im trying to be a leader
If im shining well thats the blind leading the blind
Women want me because they think I complete 'em
I just compliment them better than some nigga thats beneath 'em
I ain't talking bout remarks about their hair or what they wear
Im just a puzzle piece when mothers start to ask when can I meet him
Yeah, yeah, I know my road so we rolling
We in a part of town where I know she don't be going
Prices rather cheaper the decor is rather meager
But it's nice, it's all about the spice that they throw in
Light life off I ain't showing, for real

Im so last minute dot com
I have you sitting next to palms where the weathers rather warm
And thats the type of shit that I be on
Spontaneity with charm and it ain't costing me an arm
Legs up as im looking at the Adriatic
My hustle off down time young I gotta have it
But not for long, yes im a workaholic
Drunk off the feeling of getting it cracking
Thinking of something put it to action
And seeing it happen laying a snare
Layered with clapping and seeing them clapping
Conversations finding their way in this shit that im rapping
See it's all about exchange it ain't all about the fame
Im living upper middle class and people hardly know my name
Cause the dollars that I gain ain't at the course of rotting brains
Im from a time thats been forgotten where the scholars entertain
Music with the message, message with the music
Records for living reckless and records for wreck improvement
Practicing what im preaching good and bad in me meeting
Too much of one or the other and your perception is skewing
Fix up and care less of others doings
Visions all about results what you pursuing man
