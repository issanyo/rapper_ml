Yeah, yeah
We here man
We gon always be here
We built this city
Step by step, brick by brick
We paved this greatness since way back
The original black broadway
That stayed packed
With the masses of people
That love the way that
We march to the beat of our own drum
Or one-on-one that answered to no one ?
In a city where people come
Only to get a piece ????? at best
The Egypt of the west
Where the haves and have-nots share hotspots like wifi
But in hi-fi, this home of the brave, land of the free
Spread across a ten mile radius
My diamond district family
Can't you hear the drums in the distance?
The city got a heart beat
Calling people from far and wide
Long lines of deep pockets
We cornered the market when it comes to the hustle
Where King dared to dream
Like the million men who stood on their square
And dared to be great
But make no mistake
All that fly shit comes at a cost
We cash in at first offers, while pilgrims spilled their ??
But in the new movement
They call city improvement
Putting curfews on our show dates
No state hood rights
We live in the police state
It's the push and pull that allows us to be great
To look this crooked system right in the eyes and still see straight
The victory's just ahead, ain't no way we can turn back now
Its time to round up your troops and lace up your boots
Let us show you how
Then put your best foot forward
And March On
March on Washington
March On
March on Washington, march on....
