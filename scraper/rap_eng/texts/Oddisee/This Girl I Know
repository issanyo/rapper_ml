[Verse 1]
I got a lover but it's complicated
We've been off and on, trying to keep the fire warm
But a brother jaded
I've even moved up to Brooklyn so that we could bond
Feel like I see her even less then when I lived away
And suffocated by the city, she ain't ever home
She in LA or any other place that ain't my arms
Can't say she cheating because she was never mine alone
I just think I'm better for her than the drug dealers and the lie tellers
Yeah am I wise but I could be wrong
Please don't let be
I gave her time and a half while others get her free
And I ain't one to compare but what I see
Is her in a lesser form with anybody instead of me
We on a different page, same play different stage
Waited on the street to say hi, I must have missed the wave
Await her call to come by

[Chorus]
I know this girl around town
She cool, she cool, she cool
She coming around, 'round
When no one around, 'round
She come through, come through, she come through
We messing around, 'round
Already for now, now
We do, what we do, we do
But we know that for now, now
Is only for now, now
We through, we through, we through
But I still lover her though

[Verse 2]
We've come a long way
Even though she keep me at arm's length
Over her head and she responds late
I place the blame on all them clowns that she round
Because intelligence ain't part of their style
Smarten up, dumb it down
Drop a jewel, rocking jewelry
The way you move done parted the crowd
And I know you did the knowledge before admitted to college
So why you hanging round with this foolery
The same lame's bragging how he bagged you dorm rooms
Done tried to flip the mattress acting like he adore you
Same bed, if it ain't all true
Why am I here
ï¿¼You know they lying through the locks and the beards
Although I'm faded, I'm as sharp as they is
'Cause he ain't seen a barbershop in some years
Don't mean that he the one to lead us when apocalypse near
You know I'm right, you see the light in the days
Final calling me I'll see you tonight aye

[Chorus]
I know this girl around town
She cool, she cool, she cool
She coming around, 'round
When no one around, 'round
She come through, come through, she come through
We messing around, 'round
Already for now, now
We do, what we do, we do
But we know that for now, now
Is only for now, now
We through, we through, we through
But I still lover her though

[Verse 3]
You ever love somebody that didn't reciprocate it
But they give you just enough to keep waiting
Thinking maybe they might see you how you see them with patience
Will come say when they quit faking on the heart that you gave them
But do you give it for gift or for the feeling itself?
If nothing's in it for you, would you still be willing to help
I think my love know me more than I give credit for
She made me greater even though I tell her that I'm better for her
But she done heard it before and she gone hear it again
It's plenty men that tried to holler in metaphor
I'd love to talk to her but I talk through her
We speak our minds, same time and so I let her off
Am I the side piece or the main squeeze?
Either way, I'm filled with pride when I hear her thank me
So she can come and go as she please
She leave me 'lone but not in moments of need
Ain't only mine and maybe so it should be

[Chorus]
I know this girl around town
She cool, she cool, she cool
She coming around, 'round
When no one around, 'round
She come through, come through, she come through
We messing around, 'round
Already for now, now
We do, what we do, we do
But we know that for now, now
Is only for now, now
We through, we through, we through
But I still lover her though
