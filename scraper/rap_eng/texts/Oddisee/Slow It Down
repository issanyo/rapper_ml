[Verse 1: Oddisee]
I speak faster than I think, often
Times is hard for me to build with niggas
That get to talkin' like cheap plaster, awesome
Either I'm a deep bastard
Or as shallow as defeat
At the shore of the beach
Where you chill or you sink
After, sure, I got a lotta faults
But my lines ensure that I don't break apart
I've got a lotta bolts
A few screws loose
You gotta be a little crazy when you makin' art
See, risk-takers get a bigger piece of the pie
Them other guys get a peace sign and depart
Residin' in the dark
I'm here to outshine
Is y'all up on a nigga? Oh yeah
'Bout time, go ahead
I'm 'bout mine cause I bout with my mind
'Til out comes the prime
Example of a nigga that gamble the love of rhymes
And mixed up with the grind of a hustler in the park
Word to my pops
If y'all niggas in my way
I'm a motherfuckin' shark
And y'all niggas in my waves
I cut my braids
See me touchin' up my fade
A nigga sharp
I learned to play my part, cause I've been practicing my script
And as these bammers watch my flick
I hope they're practicin' their praise
Cause I'mma take the crown like nowish
With prowess like mine, you ain't gotta be afraid
I'm gettin' paid for my music, ain't that a blessin'
A lotta niggas never got the ball, interception
See, I was tall, so I had to power forward
Behind me's the sideline, and niggas outta breath and
I'm breathin' life into a game that I been playin'
It's no question, young, I been sayin'
That longevity is key and as I stand alone
My legs tired, I think I'll have a seat on the throne

[Hook: Sample (w/ Oddisee)]
Cause I'm rollin', I'm cruisin'
I'm groovin, I'm movin'
All too fast
(Let me slow it down)
All too fast
(Well let me slow it down)
Cause I'm rollin', I'm cruisin'
I'm groovin, I'm movin'
All too fast
(I slow it down)
All too fast
(Now let me slow it down)

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
Yeah
Oh, you wanna know which one I love more?
You or music?
I think that kind of question's stupid
Imagine choosin'
Between somethin' I'm producin'
And you, that's a win win to a loser losin'
I'd rather a twin, double you, girl
Lovin' you is like lovin' lootch
You my muse
Help me find a gem
Find a groove, like Sly and 'em
And if we don't work out, it's guaranteed I'll be dumpin' you
Cause you the prototype
I'd rather hold the microphone
Than let you spend another night alone
That sounds cold as Minnesota nights
But to get this money that we spend
I've gotta spend another night in Rome
Another tour, another stage, another flyer now
I'm on tour, accumulate the frequent flyer miles
Pick a destination, I'll take you to the top
From above the only time you can admire that

[Hook]
