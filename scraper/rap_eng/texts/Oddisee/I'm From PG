[Verse One]:
I'm from a city where niggas really rap well
Hustle hard, don't really act well
I mean, they act well
You a fool if you think they'll fool with you cause they say they cool with you, hell
I observe from afar
Getting massaged by a girl in a pair of drawers and matching bra
She tell me, "Don't get involved
They deliver it, ignore they ignorance and baby that'll piss 'em off."
I'm getting paid like Jay back in the day when he was movin' yay around my way
Down in St. Murray
Now he move with 'Ye
My kinfolk down there still fuck with flurries in they pursuit of pay
I doubt they'll ever cross over to the rap game
So they rootin' for me yellin' "Cus, get a plaque mane!"
Done
And I don't even want the rap fame
Just a byproduct when I always give a track flame

[Hook]:
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along

[Verse Two]:
I'm so independent, I do my own thang
I am not a concept, I'm my own dream
I am not a record label's idea
Of what the fuck's suppose to be a mil'
I'm here cause I want to be
Front on me? Cool
I run my own team and I don't wanna be cruel
So go ahead and follow
I'm hear to fill the void
These niggas spittin' noise like they forehead hallow
Brainless
Steady gettin' rusty
Stainless
Gotta be
Niggas taking shots at me continue to be aimless
Must be, something in the cog
For me to get ahead, niggas quit and get a job
I'm steady getting bread like a pigeon in a park
It's getting fed
A bum nigga, I learn from they mistakes
You would have misled them
I see the fakes all day
They misread them
I see the snakes anyway
Cause

[Hook]:
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along

[Verse Three]:
I'm off the deep edge
I keep it real without having to
And I don't have to stay glued to the avenue for street cred
Sad but true most do cause they give a fuck
That's hard to get a buck when it's your job to keep your peeps fed
They interrupt themselves and everybody else
And blame all but themselves for why they on the shelf
Fuck nah, I ain't no charity case
Tell my niggas, we gon' get it and deserve what we make
Yeah
X.O. what's up?
Y.U. what's up?
Diam P on the cusp
Niggas knowin' what's up
My crew is one up over all of 'em
Summer hot right now
We the fall of 'em
What?
Say something that differs
And I'm staring at you crazy like you probably fuck with dippers
It's full proof I did a case study
It's 99.9% that I'mma make money

[Hook]:
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along
Cause I'm from PG
I rep DMV
I step easily
Now who's seeing me?
None
You got a problem bring it on
You know that I'm gonna solve it, sing along
