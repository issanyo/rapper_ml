[Verse 1]

Fuck what you stand for
We will all transform
Building like a landlord
Thoughts weigh me down more than 20 jansports
Wear gloves like, even if my hands warm
Walk into a sandstorm, look into the camcord
Smile then just cry till' your damn bored
Cut the world off, why is this damn sword?
Not working im already on plan 4
Not working now im somewhere on plan 6
Im like a skater who's only tryna' land tricks
Or ralph nader just tryna' get a couple votes
I dont think the ocean cares if you rock the boat
Separation since I was playin popa roach
Last resort, lets just take it into quantum physics
Let the matrix tell me, as I am another digit
But this ain't kanye west, I will not let you finish
Man Im good like harry potter at quidish
Your like a white girl who thinks its cool to act british
Stay on the mission like apollo 13
Yes I died in between
Transition, lost hope
But I found a new dream and its....

['Hook']

Nothing like I thought it would



[Verse 2]

Music makes the  world go
Outstanding in my field like a scarecrow
Carefree but still very carefull
Im not happy in a sense but Im here though
So cheers folks
In a world full of wierd slopes
Off balanace as I challenge what I fear most
Look satan in his eyes, he appears choked
But you hear jokes
As we face pain, brace change, tears float
Far away appears close
We reach the finish line
We reach the finished line, to play another sound
A new emotion, go another round and face another fight
Another town, Im in another state to which we bless the ground
I use to, think the birds were spying on my every move
To take away my confidence and place it high up on the moons
And take my paranoia higher, then that which already looms
That pocket where the peace swiftly wakes you out and breaks the tomb
Its like, when you come upon a window in an empty room
And let the fresh breeze hit the flowers that already bloomed
Into a star
The steering wheels inside the car so take it far
You can't find what you already are

[Hook]

And its nothing like I thought it would
Its nothing like I thought it would be
Its nothing like I thought it would....yea

[Finale]

I gotta drop these memories so then I drop these melodies
For confirmation that Im real and that im not just in a dream
Im not raping to be Nas, i dont need me a kelis
Im not tryna beat the odds cus i was never in the streets
Im not doing this for god though thats a proper belief
No im doing this for me
And i do this to be free
When you try buy your dreams they tell you keep it on a lease
You can't keep me on a leash
What's a pope to a deacon or another average priest?
If the po po comin I'm not running from police
Turn the city into stains I'll stick a blade and choke your niece
Another quite proletariat that rose up out his seat
They told me quite down and wait my turn it's not your turn to speak
But I shake the fucking ground I'm nice but now it's time to leap
And I'm asaling em to sleep
That's word to 6th Element, Erbaknight, D-Haze
Big mouth turn you to the skeleton
I'm peaceful with a violent side to send you to irrelevance
And send up or down to god or Satan you will never win
Battle with the spirit, or the ego you could never win
I use to try to play it nice and say that I would never sin
But I'm a jersey devil so the rebel is forever in
But I  just want peace and that I will forever send
So it's complicated when I say that I was born again
Ok!(deep breath)
Saw light the first time
Wrote down the first rhyme
Never second guess yourself you got it right the first time
Now we elevate to serve like waiters during lunchtime
The universe is infinite how can't you have enough time?
Time is illusion so how can't you have enough time?
Too much sun is hazardous you haven't had enough shine?
Darkness use to overtake my spirit battle one time
But now I got supernovas standing on frontlines
