[Verse 1: Olivier St. Louis]
Two halves sittin' on a one-sided saw
Roundabouts is how we get 'round it all
It ain't enough to have fair space between you and the hierarchy
Wanna fight for some equality
But what about if you the boss?
And the boss always pays the cost
How you feel about your pocket, now?
You could never have it all and make everyone feel 10 feet tall
The rise and the fall must occur to all

[Chorus: Olivier St. Louis]
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong (right, wrong)
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong (right, wrong)

[Verse 2: Oddisee]
I would kill to save a life
Do you see a hero or you'd rather read me rights?
My neighborhood is getting nice
Safe to walk at night, I can't afford to pay the price
Sudan, we eat a lot of lamb
Latins like the chicken but what's better over rice
I think I'm giving out advice
But all you hear is judgement on the way you live your life
Paper that we read not the same
Yours framing me for the blame
Mine see you cause all the shame
We can't agree on a thing
We are both beyond the games
But we still play
Should I fear what's on the way?
Bigger gear push on the breaks
One man’s heart is another man’s brain
Forever then the question will remain

[Chorus: Olivier St. Louis]
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong (right, wrong)
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong
What’s right or wrong (right, wrong)

[Outro: Olivier St. Louis]
Right, wrong, right, wrong
Right, wrong, right, wrong
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
Right, wrong, ha, huh
