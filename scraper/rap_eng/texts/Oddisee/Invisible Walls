Woke up with an attitude this morning
Fuck plates, I got a buffet
You work last night, I was up late
And I'm
Thank God for my lady
Tried to ease me out of a rough day
With some good love, I couldn't fuck straight
But um
And she think it's her, I said, 'girl, it's me'
I gotta world of work, you mean the world to me
I know you're hurt, you're not always first
But I'm worth it, please
Don't you ever think about deserting me
Cuz we work together so imperfectly
Me minus you is like minus me
Cuz see, all my stress is self-inflicted
Coming from the fact that I'm tryna get shit
Got no regrets, so the gift is lifted
But what I got left, man, I can't depict it
One hand reach while the other hand holding
Got a silver linin that I'm tryna make golden
I'm the alchemist, I'm just bout some shit
Steady tryna breach what's already been broken
Livin life, it's insatiable, sensational, inspirational
Moments to reflect, I could take a few
But I don't break and snooze  I just blaze it through
Headlinin, man, making news as I go along with the story, too
Not sure what I gotta do for invincible is the obstacle and that's true

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nothing round me, I'm surrounded by
INVISIBLE WALLS


And I tell myself that I have to
Need to, got to, must do, will do, trust
I got a to-do list with a still in front
Yet I'm still in front, guess I'm fake behind
Like Nicki's ass it ain't strictly the cash
Keep finding stuff to keep me intact
Cuz I race for time
Ain't nothing telling me to wait but I'm
Acting like people tryna take what's mine
And I'm making mine what ain't really there
Cuz I really care bout what people say
Cuz I've seen you stare like
I'm the only colored brother up in here
As I ask to sit an interruption flares
Fair enough, I'll sit amongst my peers
See myself as a nigga bumping chairs
In a cafe of people who don't want me there
Yeah, the past ain't here but I'm stuck in there
Climbing over a wall and, wasn't there to witness the falling
So I prop it up like I'm not enough in what Martin fought for I'm involved in
Rebel, lackin a cause, or a cause lacking a rebel
Perplex my complex and my nerve end is disheveled
So I take a seat cuz I take what's mine and transform a date into a place in line
[But I pick to sign that reason?], I shall overcome what I climb
Peace
