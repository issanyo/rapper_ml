[Intro]
Shit is crazy
Shit is crazy
Never ceases to amaze me
Shit is crazy

[Verse 1]
I don't fret when I'm fronted on
I'm a threat, I been a nigga, niggas wanted gone
And if ya man hit me for a first verse
And he hit you up after bet you ask him for another song
I'm that nigga you put a 100 on
If you didn't what went wrong
Lord knows you can't have the sweet without the bitter
The nose bleed seats will help you see the bigger picture
And when you're on the floor the stage is where you're trying to get to
And when you're on the stage, staying there is what you wish for
Problems is relative, whether it's a million or a dollar
It's the fact you had to borrow that's the problem
Success is the same, what I may consider winning or gain
Some dismiss as I'm missing the aim
But the target ain't locked in, there's several options
Though indecisiveness try not to get lost in
I'm crazy with caution

[Hook] (x2)
Never ceases to amaze me
Yeah I'm getting all the shine and you're running out of time, huh?
Yeah, shit is crazy
Uh, shit is crazy
