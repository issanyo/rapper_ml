[Hook: Justin Vernon]
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

[Verse 1: Oddisee]
When the hairs in the back of my neck are raised up
And my heart is pumping
Means it's the start of something
Same Feeling when you come across what you're afraid of
Made up my mind, I’m jumping
Reaching for the sky, I'm trying to blow up
But if I ever fail and I start to fall in
I hope I don't land on a mine or something
Hope I don't miss my calling
Passion, Gotta have for whatever involved in
Half ass'n nine out of ten results in
Crashing, ya drive, pump breaks ya halting
But I gotta keeps it going
No time to stop, I'm a beast, I'm all in
I make hot beats, and I keep recording
Those who got beef I keep ignoring
As I keep exploring
Not a corner of the Earth, ain't psyched to see
Been in a lot of places, rumors of racists
But I can't lie, they was nice to me
Dress real smart, clothes make the man
So You noticed than I don't miss my mark
I'm always on point, I'm always so sharp
When you focus, man
You know to play parts
Positions and such or you'll end up stuck in ditches and such
A Rut you can’t get out
Game you gotta sit out
I know it’s got to suck when much is in clutch
And you just can't grasp it
Monumental, the tribulation the task is
Trial and Error
Life is
Outlast it

Chorus: Justin Vernon
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed
