[Verse 1]
Grew up on that Rap-A-Lot
Grew up on that Native Tongues
Beats be like I trap a lot
Rhyme like all I say is son
That's DC though, we made them one
That's 95, north and south
In the middle of the drive where I reside
Is what I'm talking about, lets take a ride
It's where I learned to rhyme, niggas learned to aim
And we target minds and we target brains
And we grip the chrome, be a microphone
Or that other thing man it's all the same
A lot of rappers came, a lot of rappers left
But if possessions stayed and we in the depths
No referees and that call was made
On that ballin' played and we intercept
And I handed drink tickets to my niggas in the club
Cause I don't sip nothing unless it's coming in a mug
No I ain't without a vice, always doing what you like
Got a price too quite like any other drug
I didn't go to Howard and I never wished I had
And I wasn't in the ave and I wasn't in a class
But I was in a lab turning music into math
In a dorm room too and I ain't never have a pass
Where 16th and Euclid meet
High fructose, she super sweet
Hit Tenleytown, Maggiano's
Then Georgetown for the movie seat
There's new school and old too
Eating organic with a gold tooth
Getting ignorant like no school
Or the world I was exposed too, cause

[Chorus]
PG raised me, DC made me
N.Y. paid me, all around the globe
My crew crazy, do it on a daily
Watch that hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out of time
But I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
Murder isn't a crime
When you just killing time, go
PG raised me, DC made me
N.Y. paid me, all around the globe
My crew crazy, do it on a daily
Watch that hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out of time
But I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
Murder isn't a crime
When you just killing time, go

[Verse 2]
Woke up out in Moscow
Fell asleep in Reykjav√≠k
Wrote this verse right on the plane
Tell your man to send the check
Drive me to my hotel
Make this beat along the way
Then put that in your Dropbox
My nigga why you take so long to pay
Wrote a song at sound check
Interview before the stage
That's two countries, beats and rhymes
One show, normal day
What you call a hustle I call rest time
And your deadline pushed and I need less time
I'm a man of the stars, relativity is law
And me and Einstein learned how to stretch time
Science only answers how
Religion only answers why
The two combined is the true design
So respect to God cause he drew the lines
I'm chasing paper, I'm chasing paper
The world is C.R.E.A.M. and I'm going green
Ultraviolet hit my eyelids
Lime light tanning on the scene
My skin is bronze like Jesus feet
My hair is wool, my fleece is sheep
My Skully off, my album out
And I'm ahead releasing heat
Like all the time in the world I've got
No clock to watch, no need to speed
I don't ask for; I take my time
And I want more than I could ever need, cause

[Chorus]
PG raised me, DC made me
N.Y. paid me, all around the globe
My crew crazy, do it on a daily
Watch that hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out of time
But I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
Murder isn't a crime
When you just killing time, go
PG raised me, DC made me
N.Y. paid me, all around the globe
My crew crazy, do it on a daily
Watch that hustle, y'all already know
I be on the grind like I'm running out of time
But I'm doing what I love so the clock move slow
Murder isn't a crime
When you just killing time, go
