[Verse 1]
You wear the face of strength
The armor of a tank
Keep ya' calm in a bomber's brink
Your eyes are another paint
I seen their true colors through your blinks
Thin out I'm not here to exploit your chinks
More to reinforce 'em,  from the forces sent to see you sink
Stay afloat, and stay a while, and take a break
All you hear is orders barking, brick
And mortar stopping walls and space
What a shame becoming blame of roots, and no escape
Closing gates on fate like all mistakes are born in place
All it takes is pressing forth with form and grace
Forge a bond with more than hate
Meet these words with open arms
And plant your feet the planet shakes

[Chorus]
Counterclockwise you're going in
While you make the same mistakes
Counterclockwise you're going in
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Counterclockwise you're going in
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Counterclockwise you're going in
Three, Two, One, Twelve-, Time

[Verse 2]
Let me in, let me closer
Let me hold on to what you can't composure
I'm no pushover, more like a boulder
Or come test me and rest on my shoulders
I really mean it
I know you're the meanest to me 'cause I've seen your hold ups
And you don't know trust, you only know bluffs
This world is so tough
Guess you're some kind of soldier
Hand on your holster, ready for it and it's over
You ever pulled the trigger early it hurt me before I get to closure
I won't beat you to it, I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I'm just speaking truths and you're implying that I'm hiding
I'm the mirror and all you see is you

[Chorus]
Counterclockwise you're going in
While you make the same mistakes
Counterclockwise you're going in
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Counterclockwise you're going in
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Counterclockwise you're going in
Three, Two, One, Twelve-, Time

[Verse 3]
I ain't really wanna make calls much, don't talk on the phone but
You can hit me on the cordless, in the forefront where I store us
On the tour bus where the beats loud
We can speak now, if you ain't then it's all hush
Quit acting like a loner, try growing up
We were young, when we thought the whole world would disown us
Now we  own up to the spilled milk, and the real help is the go rough
When you show love, and it heal welts, sho 'nuff
You know I got your back-, and that's just speaking facts
So when I keep it real, it's not me you attack
But anger is your drive, and that there ain't my map
If fire's all you have, then water meets your match

[Chorus]
Counterclockwise you're going in
While you make the same mistakes
Counterclockwise you're going in
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Counterclockwise you're going in
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Counterclockwise you're going in
Three, Two, One, Twelve-, Time

[Reversed]
While you make the same mistakes
Eleven, Ten, Nine, Eight
Seven, Six, Five, Four
Three, Two, One, Twelve
Time
