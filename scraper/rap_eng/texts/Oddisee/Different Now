And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse One] [Oddisee]:
She practically handed me the ass
That I could care less because she lacked class
The fitting of her dress would have had me at 21
Its funny son
Just a few years older more revealings less appealing
And I'm more into shoulders
And other subtleties
I'm in the house more thus I'm out less
I'm less concerned with rocking fits that ain't out yet
I'm still about fresh
But not my tennis shoes more about my fruit and veg
I decorate my crib my homie's couch less
That ain't the way I live
At least lately the life of a bachelor seems crazy
I went from cold pizza and old FIFA
To seeing goals scored in person at low bleachers
So lazy the youth in me I use to be
I use to like a one night stand
Now I'm all up in her house like there ain't one nice lamp

[Hook]:
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse Two] [Toine]:
You see I use to be the backpack school type
Headphones jacked up never on the new hype
Trying to clean my act up
Caught up on my own mind till the past stacked up
Failing every class shit I knew I want to rap, but
Never thought I could achieve who would I be
Not seeing the thinkers make believers from the make believe
So I had to break up out of this thing and go savage
Trying to tilt the fucking earth off its whole axis
20 years up in the game no practice
So when I turn over or crash there's no madness
No tactics
My hearts my instrumental so the ventricles just carry the sensible
But I'm still cynical
I cheat on revolutions with part time solution
But division ain't confusing I just keep it moving
Not even seeing the illusions
Cause everybody's a pimp seducing the percentage from your units
But your boy Toine never looses

[Hook]:
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?
And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?

[Verse Three] [Oddisee]:
Longer days shorter nights
Make a beat record it nice
Order rice take away
Curry out the way we say
Me and Toine ain't like to wait
Hurry out the game already
Sorta nice not enough
Rap about your paper chase
You gonna meet some niggas that just rap and keep their neighbors safe
Not a bluff kind of tough
DMV done bottled up
I'm gonna make that bottle bust
A lot of niggas carving up
Our art enough odd enough
I don't need to make a place
Smart enough new hustle
Progress the new struggle
Less about your skin color
More about your ends color
Whole worlds turning green and I don't mean recycling
That's why I'm out early queens the dollar bills trifling
Greek riots messing up the euro
Mad at that
Swedes voted right wing sad at that
In fact damn cause they from a different world
Welcome to a black mans
Obama's in the office now
Look at how they reacting

And I'm not sure why, but um things seem different now, you know?
