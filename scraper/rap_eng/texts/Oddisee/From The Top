[Verse One]:
I was raised in the state with displays of the hate
And not a lot changed, just shades of the grey
Kansas the name, and we ain't in your race
But with all that said I wouldn't trade you a place
Shame that we place little value on the real
Self esteem lowered with the talent and the skill
I keep it to myself, enjoy the silence on the hill
There's not a skyline but there's time for me to build
Plus I'm riding till the wheels fall along with the hubcap
Road less traveled, tire marks on the rough patch
Any other problem that I got can bite dust back
Got myself a compass, baby show me where the love at
And you can trust that I'm winning in the end
Just got to stay inventive when I'm getting with this pen
Not talking about a prison but my vision with the lens
For everyone that get it, all my people at the crib like...
[Hook]:
From the top all the way to Wichita
Look, I did it for y'all
KC to my folks in Arkansas
Look, I did it for y'all
From the projects to the trailer parks
Look, I did it for y'all
Cause where we shop, there's only one mall
Ha, I did it for y'all
[Verse Two]:
So I'm from a dead city in a flyover state
Got the land lock blues, really trying to escape
There's nothing to do when you're finding your way
But I promised myself I wouldn't die in this place
I ain't trying to hate, but take a look around at
All the vacant places that's located over town
It's only corporations that's been aiming for the crown
Population stagnated, same faces in the crowd
Black man
Living in a red state
Where you marginalized and treated like dead weight
And we disenfranchised in letting the led spray
And during childhood wasn't given a segue way
On and on it goes without stopping
It's central Topeka y'all know it's been popping
And we all about the doe, we hope to go flossing
Back against the wall, we hope for more options
[Hook]:
From the top all the way to Wichita
Look, I did it for y'all
KC to my folk in Arkansas
Look, I did it for y'all
From the projects to the trailer parks
Look, I did it for y'all
Cause where we shop, there's only one mall
Ha, I did it for y'all
