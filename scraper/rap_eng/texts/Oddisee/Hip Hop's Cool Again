(Hey somebody email me a list of the top eMCees that's doin' it right now so I can notify 'em about my takeover and shit. I CC y'all. Yeah. It's Oddisee by the way. It's DMV by the way. Yeah. Check it.)

[Verse 1]
Back at it
So out the box in an instant I spit and get cheese
Craftmatic
So out the box in the present I represent the eMCees
Of the past the icons
At the last my Mic's on
Alas the light's on
I flash 'em shinin' for minutes of fame
For continuous streams of a dream that I climbed in
I flow on and on like the Nile and Amazon and Mississippi
Steam 'cuz I'm risin heat before you're eyes
I'm planning on
Standing on top like I know I'm the man and all
Like a year ago I wasn't even a man involved
Solving my own problems I might hand 'em off
Fumble
Intercept myself corrected
Now I'm a player of the game wasn't even expected
On the humble

[Chorus]
No stoppin' this (yeah yeah)
Take it to the top in this (yeah yeah)
Represent the block for this (yeah yeah)
And we go' make it pop in this (yeah yeah)
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
It's Oddisee and I'm takin' y'all to school again

[Verse 2]
(yeah)
I'm half A-rab half nigga
AK47 9 milli mixture
In the mosque friday sunday scripture
Parents split because they views always differ
Get harassed at the airport and the block
By the FBI, Interpol & the cops
I'm acclimated to the winter cold and the hot
Spit a flow in the desert rollin' on a cinder block
Concrete jungle yeah that's my livin' spot
Sudanese restaurant that's the dinner spot
Wake up breakfast on facin' mecca don
Got the wheaties yeah i'm the champ of the (get it pie)
Bend
No stoppin'
The ball i'm passin' y'all like stock-ton
I'm after those claimin' they on top and
I topple them like west bank apart-ments

[Chorus]
No stoppin' this (yeah yeah)
Take it to the top in this (yeah yeah)
Represent the block for this (yeah yeah)
And we go' make it pop in this (yeah yeah)
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
It's Oddisee and I'm takin' y'all to school again

[Verse 3]
(yeah)
May my competitors fall
I better myself by look at myself in the mirror
Hear myself say I'm better than y'all
Telling myself who am I to argue with that
I mean its fact so I'm betting it all
On the underdog in the motor race
Runnin' tall catch the motorcade at a slower pace
So the sweat is involved
Tears to us and the blood'll stand through those
Except for the fall
I represent 'em
The streets you rappin' 'bout, I'm in 'em
A preacher lashin' out in denim
The speakers blackin' out - I'm in 'em
Pumpin' that bass like bass free show
At the club pack it out and kill 'em
Leave nothing before or after
Fire like the lord and rapture
I am like the (raw) and pastor
The foundation of this DMV gritty shit
I recall and capture

[Chorus]
No stoppin' this (yeah yeah)
Take it to the top in this (yeah yeah)
Represent the block for this (yeah yeah)
And we go' make it pop in this (yeah yeah)
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
I'm makin' hip hop look cool again
It's Oddisee and I'm takin' y'all to school again
