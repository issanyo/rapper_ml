I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretending I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be, seen

[Oddisee]
Losing sight of what matters
Dimming my demeanor in the brightness of the flatter
Enticing is the chatter of room filled with candor
Replaced by fumes that conclude with the banter
Moth to a flame and I couldn't hold a candle
To what I use to be, to what I use to handle
I use to be hungry appetite for respect
And now I just expect people want something from me
Service at the table that revolved in my favor
Designated savior guess I'm picking up the check
Developing a pallet for a rather bitter flavor
The fruits of my labor at a price I won't fetch
It cost me some friends, it cost me connects
But they ain't even debt that I would see as regret
But most men would, as I probably should but the man I am now ain't the man I recollect

[K-os]
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be, seen

[Oddisee]
Searching for the elements of how I came together
I stumbled on some blame and bumped into whatever
My disposition saying I don't give a fuck never
But there was a few times when the armor got severed
The walls came down, the skin wasn't leather
And if you wanted to hurt me, the closer, the better
My foes were, posing as a shoulder
And as I went I to lean on, they let me fall over and those are
The lessons that you when you're older
It's harder to burnt once your heart becomes colder, a boulder
But in return for your heart of stone
It's harder to let your guard down when the problems gone, a soldier
That keeps fighting when the war's done
Forever ready for when more comes, yeah
And im aiming at the mirror I might end up shooting me
Don't recognise the man that I use to be
Who's he?

[K-os]
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be, seen
Holla and ya holla, you follow you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you follow you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you follow you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you follow you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you follow you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you follow you fall
Yo, Whatever I don't really know
Flows like an immaculate gold what up, whatever
