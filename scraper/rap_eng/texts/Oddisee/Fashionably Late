It's 9 o'clock on the dot
At the spot
And I'm hanging' with her friends again
Great taste
Beautiful place
And you're fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don't wanna be that guy
That makes you sad
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Making out with your friends (Go!)

I love the way that this began
Started off right
So innocent
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
I want your best friend
I'm giving' it up and asking why
You seem so shocked and so surprised
I'm sorry it hurts
I'm surely a jerk
I understand why you're mad

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact
Don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody knows I'm wrong (Wrong!)

It's 9 o'clock on the dot
At the spot
And I'm hanging with her friends again
Great taste
Beautiful place
And you're fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don't wanna be that guy
That makes you sad
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Making out with your friends (Mwah!)

It's got nothing to do with how you look
Just another excuse to write a hook
I'm letting you know
And after all you're not my type
But all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean
Stop making a scene
And take some want of advice

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact
Don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody knows I'm wrong (Right?)

It's 9 o'clock on the dot, at the spot
And I'm hanging' with her friends again
Great taste
Beautiful place
And you're fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don't wanna be that guy, that makes you sad
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Making out with your friends

And I've got the topic conversation now
And I know I'm running out of time (Yeah!)
It's on an honest demonstration now
You're not the only one
Not the only one

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact
Don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody sing along (Ahhh!)

And I don't wanna be that guy
That makes you sad
That makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Fucking all your friends (What?)

It's 9 o'clock on the dot
At the spot
And I'm hanging' with her friends again
Great taste
Beautiful place
And you're fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don't wanna be that guy
That makes you sad
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Making out with your friends

Making out with your friends
Making out with your friends

Without a doubt
Sorry about
Having sex with all your friends
(Hahaha!)
