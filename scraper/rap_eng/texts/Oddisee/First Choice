[Chorus]
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye with your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt to let it shine

[Verse 1]
Fork in road, one is chose, least I drove
Nothing's easy, what's a freebie? All is sowed, we been reaping in the fold
In the creases where I stow, lucky see me, see my lows
Only highs I meant to show like all I'm meant to be is so
[?] close to being exposed
Can't have that so guard your secrets, they're the weakness to your foes
Catch you slipping on the slope, your position's in they scope
Take a hit and keep on ticking quick decision bleed to glow
Freeze the gold, no need to know the answer follow reasons seen to go
This ain't rocket science just have heart and mind and beat them both
Over thinking overboard, soaked and sinking close to shore
Could have made a fear of failure sings the forward former port [?]
On accord the king to cost the Queen to cost him a loss
Hindsight is stronger, believe that if he back at dawn
Without the help of warnings your mornings repeat like alarms
You know the answer quit dancing around it an get dressed for prom

[Chorus]
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye with your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt to let it shine

[Verse 2]
I feel it more than ever, you know? The inevitably inevitable
It's better to leave than never to know, who better than me to tell me to go?
But the best is yet to come, will I regret the steps to run?
Leave the next one next to none on a quest to manifest the destined sun
I don't know but I'm cool with that, foolish perhaps to choose this or that or nothing at all
For this could build while that collapse and I stand on stilts now fit to fall
So why make a move like, pushin's sort of rude like
I'm that sort of dude who wants it all to prove that it ain't all it's viewed like
Yo, running in circles and waiting in lines, jumping the hurdles we make in our minds
I'ma just go with the flow and I hope when it's over I'm over and made it in time
Knowing the moment the opening close in the road and roses of war before
The battle was hell, neglected to tell, went for the second, I reckon I failed

[Chorus]
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye with your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
All must always, always go, with your first choice– Aye
With your first voice–say
In your mind's sight, blind by the thirst to make it work
Sometimes you gotta lay it in the dirt to let it shine
