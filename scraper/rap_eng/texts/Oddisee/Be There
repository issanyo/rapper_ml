[Verse 1]
I know I'm hardly ever home
And it's hard to ever get me on the phone
But you get me, I'll never leave you alone
You ain't with me but I got you
I'll spot you if your money's ever low
But kill all that pride shit cause brothers don't hide shit
Different mothers never made us siblings divided
Our father taught us lessons through the way he provided
When talking about bonds this as strong as the tie gets
What ever you choose to do in life, I'm behind it
And shout out to my brothers not related by blood
Some people think I made it, if it's true it's because
I had a team that when shit got real, and I doubted my dreams
They'd remind me it ain't as hard as it seems
I just hope that I can pay them all back for the advice that they gave
Will I ever match the price to be paid
I don't know, but I'll spend my whole life trying to make things right
If you need me, I'ma be within sight
And we gon' be alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Crazy to be your older brother
There's women but my sisters in the category other
I guess I got a fear of some shit that I did
Being done to them by some nigga they love dear
I only hope that the lessons that I gave them as kids
Stay with them in relationships and they know the biz
Cause y'all are young women now and I see you as such
No need to worry cause the cloth that we cut from tough
Y'all troopers in the moment of clutch, don't ever give up
But when things rough, just know I'm there
A liver, heart or kidney know that you've got a spare
I hope to be your role model, a best friend and brother
From the bottom of my heart, you know I love you
The world is yours but I'ma hold it till you're ready
And hand it over to you when your situation's steady
Just finish your college, live a little, and make some mistakes
The type you bounce back from, no permanent aches
And I got you if it's ever more than you can take
