[Hook: TheColorGrey]
Over my life, can't lose control
'cause I can't see what the future holds
Don't you know life, is like an hourglass
And every day is just a grain of sand

Nobody is gonna turn it upside down
When you feel you running out of time
Hope they never try to break my glass
Hope I'll never try to do that myself

Truth is oh oh oh oh I don't know
Oh oh oh how could I know
But let me tell you this
Someday you will..
Someday you will..
Try not to think about it..
Yeah let me tell you this
Someday you will..
Someday you will..
Try not to think about it..

[Oddisee]
I try not to think about
What I can't change at all
What I can control is way too much
For what my brain can hold
Got me operating slow
Shed the weight to say afloat
Or maybe there's a raft within the past
That I could make a boat
It ain't a lesson, 'till it's old enough
To question, could be the second after
Or delayed effects could set in
And I keep running 'way from matters
Try to get a breath in
I hold my tongue and both my lungs
And then release my bladder
Pissed off about the world
And all that's going on
Getting off the roller coaster
'Stead of holding on
Ain't nothing wrong
But could be better like an older phone
Something new to fill the void
Of feeling so alone
It's only numbing, so the throbbing
Just come back to summon
What I was dodging I just un run in
Ain't too good at blocking
I tried to doubt it
Total darkness ain't the same as clouded
I never knew until I tried
Not to think about it
So what to do

[TheColorGrey]
Over my life, so what to do..
Can't lose control
'Cause I can't see, what the future holds
Don't you know life, is like an hourglass
And every day is just a grain of sand

Nobody is gonna turn it upside down
When you feel you running out of time
Hope they never try to break my glass
Hope I'll never try to do that myself

Truth is oh oh oh oh I don't know
Oh oh oh how could I know
But let me tell you this
Someday you will..
Someday you will..
Try not to think about it..
Yeah let me tell you this
Someday you will..
Someday you will..
Try not to think about it..

You can call me sway
Ain't got the answers
But I will have 'em
Once I close this chapter
Would I wanna know the future in advance
Don't it ruin all the fun
When you know how the story ends
But this is life that we're talking 'bout
You can make one wrong move
And goodbye, you're out
That's why I'm tip toeing
Something I've been knowing
Been knowing no matter
What we people still
Ignorant
Guess I just got to hold my breath
Take a dive in the deep
Got no clue of what
I might end up seeing
Let's find out just how far I can reach
Or would I only want to swim
Back to the surface?

Oh, oh, oh, oh I don't know
Oh oh oh how could I know
But let me tell you this
