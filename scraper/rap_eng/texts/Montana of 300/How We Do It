[Chorus: Jalyn Sanders]
When we hit the club
You know how we do it
My niggas saucing
Oh yea we do this often
When we hit the club
Got these killas that will set it off
Haters, they don't want no problem with us
Hit the teli bitches following us

When we hit the club
You know how we do it
My niggas saucing
And oh yea we do this often
After the club
Got these killas that will set it off
Haters they don't want no problem with us
Hit the teli bitches following us

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Bitches in here showin' love
Tryna get full of them drugs
They lit and I'm still rollin' up
Yea squad got this bitch going up
While designer got these haters showing mugs
All the these bitches fit to throw me some
Couple shots of Henny but I don't get drunk
Gotta stay on point the killas know wassup
Pop a Xan, yeah we breakin' them rules
All the sauce we drippin' making some juice
Swag attackin' from my chain and my shoes
Bunch of savages just make us some room yeah

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
My niggas in they bag
These haters pissed they mad
Might take they bitch I got that sauce that they wish they had
I'm ballin' hard and if I bought it bitch my benz they ask
If they talk any trash
Might let that semi blast
Killas with me that's no murder for me
Up in VIP, I got the 30 on me
I be ballin' I should have my jersey on me
Like a scarecrow, I got the birdies on me
Pussy calling me on both phones
When that money call I gotta postpone
Wasn't no fun and games till that money came
Had to grind to it like a slow song
Now my diamonds lookin' like some snow cones
Dancing on a nigga like they ozone
Signing autographs
Like a fucking cast
Cuz I'm snappin' harder than a broke bone
Woa I work too gotta pay a nigga
I don't play with niggas
I'll spray a nigga
I done murdered guys
And like word to God
I'll send it up like a prayer nigga squad

[Chorus: Jalyn Sanders]
When we hit the club
You know how we do it
My niggas saucing
Oh yea we do this often
When we hit the club
Got these killas that will set it off
Haters, they don't want no problem with us
Hit the teli bitches following us

When we hit the club
You know how we do it
My niggas saucing
And oh yea we do this often
After the club
Got these killas that will set it off
Haters they don't want no problem with us
Hit the teli bitches following us

[Verse 3: No Fatigue]
Pitch it to her fresh on that fab shit
She want mine till she know they cap shit
Take her with me put her were her abs is
Next city all of that was past tense
We ain't worried 'bout no niggas keep that pole with us
Let it blow niggas
Like elbows won't fold niggas
Suace drippin' better check the flow nigga
Women choose let them bitches judge
VIP in all these different clubs
Poppin bottles and we dance enough
Hope no niggas get to acting up
Niggas really bitches like Mulan
Like Gucci with it hit it 2 times
Kill a rap a verse just with 2 lines
I'll be goin' in like its school time
Money coming like it's in a rush nigga
Smiling I will make yo bitch blush nigga
Ima dog so you know I'm rough nigga
Jewelry shinning like the shit is buff nigga
Gang with me like are we some bloods nigga
Gang drippin' there might be a flood nigga
It's yo love when we hit the club nigga
Pullin blades on us we don't trust niggas

[Chorus: Jalyn Sanders]
