[Hook]
Man, ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
Got hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way  more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now

[Verse 1]
Was caught up in that street life
Hustling moving big loud
Had to kick out quick
Feel like the devil had me pinned down
Rap God I was sent down
Labels want to sit down
Mama got a big smile
My lyrics pay the rent now
I be setting trends now
Walk-throughs, I get 10 thou'
Remember window shopping
I got options when I spend now
Used to rock white tees
I got versace on my skin now
Bitches on my dick
They want to blow me like the wind now
I know them niggas pissed now
30 in my clip now
I swear I won't  miss, (pow)
Y'all families gon' miss y'all
Still got pistols hidden in every room inside my crib now
Knew I was gon' blow like a grenade, I pulled that pin out
All I do is win now
So I know what it is now
They figure since I'm poppin' I got money I can lend out
So that's that greed within y'all , Don't care if I offend y'all
Knowing y'all ain't real, but everyone wanna pretend now

[Hook]
Man ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now

[Verse 2]
Man, every time I drop some music
These bitches get shot by cupid
I'm not foolish, far from stupid
So miss me with all that fu shit
I can smell an opportunist
As strong as your perfume is
I see through the dark
I'm blessed with a light as bright as the moon is
Man as soon you start buzzing
Hoes crushing all of a sudden
Bunch of niggas showing love
With hopes they can fit in your budget
Out here acting like day ones
When they know that they really wasn't
But I'm out like a concussion
No question they ain't one hunnid'
Got deal with so much hate now
I gotta watch them snakes now
My struggles I embrace now
I'm too Godly to break down
Bitches think it's sweet
They wanna see how good it taste now
And even those who hate
Mention my name with all the greats now
I be getting dough now
Moncler when it's cold out
Giuseppe's  when he's stepping
Need a red carpet to roll out
Ain't have to sell my soul to be on top
And sell these shows out
I'm no fire truck but niggas know I bring the hose (hoes) out

[Hook]
And ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
