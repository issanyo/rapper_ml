[Hook: Montana of 300]
Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no nothing less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no nothing less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!

[Verse 1: J Real & Talley of 300]
I'm duckin' the feds
Still strapped with my Glock cause the opps want me dead
Fucked up in my head
Got shot in the neck, but now that nigga dead
You heard what I said
You think this a game?
Well come on and play it
I'm hoppin' out sprayin'
I pop tops like a can
Leave your mama prayin'
30 and that 40 50 in that FN Nina
Uh
If I can get next to you then I can get next to [?]
If you don't got my bands, then someone gettin' stretched again
Kickin' in a door, lifting up my pole, then I'm steppin' in

I get that, that click clack, got kickback, 3 ninjas
If he in the crowd, when that 50 spit, then donâ€™t get whacked, he injured
I wish niggas would, I swing choppers, like lumberjacks, then timber
If your foot soldiers want war, then I'm gon' send shells, that's Splinter
A lot of choppin' and flippin'
These niggas poppin' like bitches
Soon as he jump, it's like bungee, but bodies drop, that's the differenceAnd these just not my niggas, it's more than gang gang gang
If they say let's ride, then I'ma slide and it's bang bang bang bang, bitch, bang bang!

[Verse 2: $avage & No Fatigue]
Savage with a dollar sign, cause I'm runnin' up a check
But when I shoot, bang bang, nothin' but the net
30 in the clip and it got one up in the net
I'm aiming at you turnin' up, television set
Pull up on your block, tinted windows, black paint
They sayin', "Who's that" like I'm playin' for the Saints
Come up with my jacket, double breasted, Max Payne
Finna kill a brother like I'm Abel and Kain

Smoke 'em like some Jane
All black like Bruce Wayne
Then I take off like a plane
His homie said look out, like a window when it bang
These shots got no fatigue, it's too late, it hit his brain
Homie tried to run, no synonym, yeah he get the same
I blow like Cain, caught him with the range, left him by his range
I probably hit his main, then I rock the shirt, say I feel the same
Shorty it's not a game, shoot him like a picture, put him in a frame

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]
I make bitches in your city scream like Sidney when they trip
If you see me, come get with me if you really with the shits
I don't internet like Drizzy and Meek Milly with this shit
Curtis Jackson in my ratchet I got 50 in my clip
If I give your ass a day, you won't live to see the fame
You want to explain, but I want to see your brains
Been there, done that, you don't want none of that
Cock my gun back, let it bang
I be with a bunch of crooks, nigga
One in the neck, like a crook, nigga
When I come around, open up a round, like a hook, nigga
Slide on them squares, like a rook, nigga
All headshots, yearbook, nigga
Blowin' like a ref, with this fuckin' tec
Like a fuckin' chef, I cook niggas
Body bag him up, like some kush, nigga
Wet that pussy up, that's douche, nigga
Got your day one homies, all shook, nigga
Now they talkin' 'bout, he was a good nigga
Whatchu know 'bout standing in the cold waitin'
'Bout to give it to him, like a donation
Gun clappin', like a standing ovation
Been droppin' niggas, no probation
Squad
