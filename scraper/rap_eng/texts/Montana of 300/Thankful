[Hook: Montana Of 300]
Thankful that I'm here, could be in jail or in a casket
Checks on top of checks, yeah, that's why I be talkin' cash shit
On baby, like a car seat, that strap on me up in traffic
And everyone I knew who had it, got it doing bad shit
Thankful that I'm here, could be in jail or in a casket
Checks on top of checks, yeah, that's why I be talkin' cash shit
On baby, like a car seat, that strap on me up in traffic
And everyone I knew who had it, got it doing bad shit

[Verse 1: TaySav]
Swear I lost my soul when I seen Pappy in that casket
Promised all my brothers we gon' ball hard like the Magics
They like: “Why you be spazzin'?”
“Lil bitch, 'cause this my passion”
I promise I won't stop 'till I got 20 in the Aston
Pull up on hater, flexing like:  “I'll see you later!”
To these bitches, I'm a pimp, but I ain't never wore no gators
Went too crazy on my team, so now my name in the debates
And they sayin' I'm the greatest to come out this generation
I'm paid, bitch, I'm paid
Give a fuck 'bout being famous
Went from being caged to receiving hella payments
Don't think that I'm clueless just because I never say shit
In my own lane, stayin' away from all that hatred

[Verse 2: Montana Of 300]
Grew up in the projects, struggling, I never had shit
Canned goods in the cabinet, you would think that we was fasting
Eating once a day, had to stretch it just like gymnastics
But nowadays, I flip through good paper just like a tablet
Once you get shit cracking, they on your nuts like pistachios
If you fall off, they'll walk out on you just like a patio
And I can't trust a soul, so I choose to stay with that calico
This cannon blow, your ass'll get shot as quick as a cameo
Play around, I'ma spray him down
Hammer Time, he nailed
Hella drugs, retail
That's how we ate, Sprewell
Been after M's, D12
That's for sure, no sea shells
Just moved my mamma out the fuckin' hood, V12

[Verse 3: BuDouble]
Thankful for my blessing - fully automatic weapon
We just keep it for protection
Promise, we ain't being reckless with it
Bands on top of bands, we came from nothin', so we flexing with it
Runnin' up these checks, I swear you thought that we was testin' with it
Nigga, we was starving
We was fighting, we was arguing
We was on that carpet, eight kids, three bedroom apartment
And I ain't can't forget my niggas who I lost right to them trenches
'Bout my niggas who ain't answer questions, they just took a sentence
Damn near lost my life 'cause I'm really spittin' what I'm livin'
Biggie said he'll rot in prison just to see this vision fall through
Just to see us win, just to see us whippin' all coupes
Just to see us livin', just to see us spendin' all blues
