[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Straight out the jungle watch for Anacondas
Only so far you can see stay prepared for the drama
Know my squad gotta eat, so we do what we gotta
All while we pray for the weak, we take food from the monsters
God strong and I’m conscious keep one eye on the watchers
In the valley of the shadow we keep that light upon us
Play no games with the Joker they’ll see dark nights it’ll be Gotham
Ready and willing if Walter in it we shootin’ like Contra
It’s gonna be shocking like Blanka
Chopping shit up like Baraka
Ain’t no need for the doctors just prayers or peace for the mamas
Then it’s back to the gwalla them dollars decimals and commas
Cuz I handle that business with no degree I’m a scholar
Don’t judge book by its cover you turn that page we will pop up
All I know is go get it me and my niggas is shottas
Amputate ya ‘bout paper at pussy necks like we collars
We'll hit ya then will forget ya nigga hakuna matata

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
Little nigga from the ninth floor, mom was on that white hard
Daddy was a vice lord, pistol sit in my drawls
Like a eagle I soar, like I lion I roar
Shorty keep that forty buddy lowkey like he fight Thor
So much blood on my sword yet there’s love for my lord
Banana clips for all you monkeys curious just like George
I’m a gorilla fearin’ no nigga, I’m a go getter with a pole wit ‘em
I got the thirty so it’s more than twenty cent when I hit his ass wit the four nickel
Way hotter than summer break make yo bitch do a double take
I come from a troubled place money longer than bubble tape
I take me and my money and two pistols on a double date
No safety bullets glisten at your squad before yo huddle break
These niggas sweet one shot a leave hole in 'em, funnel cake
Exterminate I come and spray I terminate ain’t nothing safe
I’m a humble nigga but my semi ain’t boy it spit and sing like it’s drizzy Drake
When I kick bo’s like I’m Billy Blanks it’ll wet a nigga like he in a lake
So you sell weight gettin’ plenty cake say you war ready but you really ain’t
I got hittas that a crack a head open for a little change like a piggy bank
Squad

[Verse 3 – Talley of 300]
Like lightning is strikin, like lighting is frightening
This world for the mighty, so come prepared to clash with the titans, yeah
I’m strapped like security flash my light like the night-shift
Heard you hard and heart cold okay well bitch ima ice pack
Shoot like David at Goliath got the power to slay the giants
Bitch ima lion
A beast in these streets ima tyrant
No library but these bitches keep quiet or its a riot
Come front with a struggle its dire
But everyone wanna be sire, till they feel the fire
That pistol part of my attire
?????
Bitch I’m the flyest

[Verse 4 – Montana of 300]
My flow is so real, its so ill they say its sicker than Ebola
I got the heart of a lion but my shit colder than Cobras
Approach get stretched like aerobics
And we don’t bluff this ain’t poker we got tear drops in our faces like derrick rose with the fold ups
Look in the eyes of my enemies let em know ima solider
And for that bread I’ll burn you Montana stay with that toaster
My 7 up on you niggas you can get popped like a soda
This Gucci belt be my holster no I don’t smoke but I smoke ya
Squad
