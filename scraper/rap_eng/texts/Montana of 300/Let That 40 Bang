It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

[Verse 1]
Niggas think that it's a game, let that 40 bang
Let em know that you ain't playin', let that 40 bang
Put that thang up to his brains, let that 40 bang
Now everybody in the city sayin' shorty name
Gettin' scared everytime that they see shorty out
Hopin' he don't pull that mutha fuckin' 40 out
Cause they know he don't give a fuck, they know that shorty wild
Only two words that he know(what's that), that's 40 cal
30 clip extended, if he feel offended
Shorty squeezin' that trigger, til that mutha fucka empty
That's just how he do it, he know what he doin'
Once he off that 40, ain't no talkin' bitch he shootin'
Tear drops all in his face and in his trigger fingers
All he need is his 40 and his trigger fingers
Fuck a fuck nigga and fuck what that nigga thinkin'
Come to his spot and air him out, leave that nigga stinkin'

[Hook](x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came

[Verse 2]
He tatted up like tunechi, stay up in some gucci
Prolly in a black wing, he hop up out that hooptee
Then he get excited, cause you niggas look like groupies
All you niggas pussy, watch that 40 cal eat coochie
Where shorty from my nigga everyday is doomsday
So he stay with that 40 like they roommates
Hit up the block and let that mutha fuckin tool spray
And leave all you niggas lyin', April fool's day
He be on that killa shit, shorty far from innocent
You know what the business is, one of yo niggas been a vic
Right now you fuckin with a nigga that don't give a fuck
Ain't talkin phone numbers when I say shorty hit em up
It's 300, you already know what they're about
2 steps, find out his whereabouts and air him out
Now he flexin' on you niggas Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to reach for shorty chain, watch my 40 bang

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
If them niggas want beef, let that 40 bang
If them niggas think it's sweet, let that 40 bang
Ain't gotta meet me in the streets to let that 40 bang
I'll bring that shit to where you sleep, let that 40 bang(BANG!!!)
