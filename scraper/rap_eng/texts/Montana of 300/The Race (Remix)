[Verse]
I Just, I just beat another gun case
Now I can do shows outside the United States
I got shit locked it in the a motherfucking safe
Paper on paper like a nigga tryna trace
Gorillas with me and they love me they gone spray
But imma say I pray this cake don't turn my apes up into snakes. Let me find out I will not miss you I'm not case
Cause I'm gone shoot you right up in your fuckin' face fuck
Niggas always run they mouth and wanna hate
I'm taking all them bitches out elimi-date
Get outta line I bet this .40 set him straight
This bitch got kick, free my nigga Kevin Gates
My gun be singing, it be spittin' like its Drake
Mashed potato on the barrel, then I spit after it bake
Campaign, champagne when this .30 pop off
.40 bang blood drippin' down his clothes, Scott Hall
And you know I'm squeezing triggers until all my opps fall
For life, I got bars; I'm not Ray, I'm not Claude
And my broski 'nem up next like I'm Lonzo, I ball
Eating good and i put that on everything hot sauce, Don't act like I'm not God hope my flow is not flawed
Every bar is rock hard, bitch my lyrics drop jaws
Ever since I was a pup I knew I'd be top dog
Man you rappers not raw  hang it up like dropped calls, Bitch Im' the truth don't run no game you can't finesse
Make moves like chess up on these squares just call me fresh, Green like the Jets, slid through New York, ball like the Mets. Yo bitch she wet she peeped the dickprint in my sweats, went down they tried to count me just like a ref, bitch I'm self made, I'm CEO, i cut checks came in the game started killing, Thomas Chef caught my first .30 you couldn't tell me I wasn't Steph
Panda Express we cookin' cats I'm like the chef
I will Smith & Wesson up if he get jazzy like he Jeff
And i ain't perfect, hell yeah I done been in trouble before
Up in a, jungle with bro, we used to hustle and flow
Ain't shit to catch a body I done caught a couple before
Man its the drug deal killer still juggle the flow
Up in the rental with a pistol and a bundle of dough
Man i been flexing on these niggas since N.W.O
Bad bitch on me want to put that monkey on me like Aladdin
I'm fly and my dick gigantic, she want the pipe like an addict
She bounce on it like a rabbit she scream my name got it tatted, Pulled it out opened her mouth put my wood in just like a cabin, She a savage anytime, anyplace I nicknamed her Janet
Blew on me Orlando Magic thats gettin' top like an attic
Boy yo ass don't want no beef, don't want no smoke, don't want no static, toolie on my Gucci belt tote that hammer like a mechanic, when these clips leave everybody wet, you ain't watching Titanic, wreaking havoc, heaters blasting sound like they speaking Spanish, I get busy with this .50 it singing like Lenny Kravitz, blow a hole in you and yo bro like you was Goku and Raditz, bitch you average, I be spazzin I'm major pain on you maggots
FGE we keep green on us, like we from planet namek, May 20th "Pray for the Devil" on the way!
Rap God bitch I just did the Race
