(Hahahaha)
Class in session, I hope you came here to listen
I give you what they ain't gon’ mention
I keep it a buck, you can't find this knowledge in college
It's priceless, just pay me attention
See my teacher told me, "One day you gon’ wake up in prison"
'Cause I used to stay in detention, I made a decision
To avoid some fatal collisions by being my greatest invention
The greatest that did it, every line got 'em hooked, right now I'm takin' 'em fishing
I am LeBron, I do more than just play my position, I'm Phil, Rodman, MJ and Pippen
Shake off the sadness, regain your ambition, to put in that work is to pay your admission
When I come and cook 'em, it ain’t in the kitchen, I’m just warming up though, like making some biscuits
Preparing my students, testing their faith for their vision, they wonder what grade I'ma give ’em
And when you're a god you don't wonder if heaven exists, you just wonder which way you gon' kill ’em (Woo, woo)
See life is a bitch and she's beautiful, but her attitude ain't the prettiest
Reality ain't got no sympathy, no man is a failure until he quits
See, half of y'all won't understand me, but my music's not for the idiots
God is my host and the haters get ghost soon as they see these clips ain't insidious
It's time to go in, I turn up like keys in the whip, pardon my English, I'm lit
I go hard in the paint, like a bitch that was keying your whip with a heart that don't even exist
Who would've thought, all of the pain and the struggle I went through would lead up to this?
I done took off, success is the reason they pissed, I got all the ingredients, bitch
(Chemistry class) Don't show your true colors and die, 'cause I am the teacher that drips
Ready for that action, they can't end my movie too early, so I got to squeezin' a clip (Let me talk to 'em)
Life doesn't need to me do it's job, so I'm not here to give you a tough time
But the reason that you claim you ain't eating is 'cause you do too much talking at lunchtime
See I had to go through some dark days to make sure my daughter and son shine
I gotta take care of what's mine, I can't put nothing above mine
I got a gun up in my desk, if the devil walks in Im'a bust mine
What the fuck you think I keep the metal for? Most of y'all won't catch that was a punch line
When I got that work out it wasn't gym class, I got more weight off than SlimFast
I had lots of green on me like Kick-Ass, now like Santa Claus I got a big bag
Bitches wanna wrestle 'cause they heard a nigga seein' seven figures like a phone number
Tell 'em kick rocks like Dwayne Johnson, see the cold shoulder, Stone Cold Stunner, huh
I can't seem to shake all my savage ways, I praise God and then go let that ratchet blaze
You gon' think I was Thor with my hammer raised, then I bang at your top, Diamond Dallas Page
Got my opposition tryna watch and listen while I kill 'em with bars, call that riot prison
You so stubborn that you forgot how to listen while you sit around waiting on God to fix it
See I knew it was something beyond the trenches, I knew riches don't ever respond to wishes
And when life wasn't fair to me, God was still there for me, my lyrics therapy, lots of healing
I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and see my best friend and my competition
Passion all in my labor, I'm optimistic, got money off the mic like I'm Robin Givens
I'm heaven sent I was airborne, the pain is what got me in rare form
See Malcolm X told us that the future belongs to the ones that prepares for it
They didn't witness your struggle so they cannot judge you at all because they wasn't there for it
Tell my haters Montana's prepared for 'em, fuck they lives and fuck whoever cares for 'em
I jumped off the porch at age seventeen, was the flyest killa that they ever seen
James Bond in that Chevy thing shoot until blood into your eyes that's that 007 screen
I finally moved on to do better things, once I divorced the streets with no wedding ring
Put my life in these bars like I'm Claude and Ray, worked my magic then left, Penny Hardaway
God didn't write none of these books, it was the humans that touched it
How you askin' for strength and forgiveness but scared to ask God if a book was corrupted?
We are students of life so we keep learning, 'cause the truth is we never get out of school
I had to get on that right track, I had to hurdle them obstacles
You gone train or complain bitch you gotta choose, I share knowledge with y'all 'cause I rock with you
Anything you do good that's the God in you, I'm just here to bring more of that out of you
I'm everyone's favorite teacher, I am the one you should watch for
When it comes to that fire I got more, now you niggas know what's in my top drawer
