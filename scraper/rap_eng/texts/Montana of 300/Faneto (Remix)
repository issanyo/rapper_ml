In the whip cruising through the town
Hustling moving pounds

Never threw in towels
Made my goonies proud
Model bitches wanna do me now
They like groupies now

Better move around
No mechanic but no need to panic
Keep theat tooley round

45 to his chest
Call him Boobie Miles
Shoot em' up
Then I shoot em' down
We don't fool around
Wet em' up
Come swim with the sharks
I bet you will drown
Yo squad filled with pussycats
Make yo crew meow
Extendo clips

Patrick Ewing style
I'll smoke everybody in this bitch
Like a hookah lounge
Broski nem blowing fruity loud
My whole crew be wild
GANG!
