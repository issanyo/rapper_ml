[Chorus: No Fatigue]
I had a dream I took a shot, and I made it
People started hating, sneak dissin, wanna say shit
Dreamed that I was flexin, on the daily
Was broke then I was rich, yeah
Man that shit was crazy
Yeah I dreamed I was really up in first place
Yeah I dreamed that I made it out my birth state
Yeah I dreamed I was saucin' and they couldn't take it
Yeah I dreamed I was on and they couldn't say shit
I had a dream, yeah
I had a dream, yeah

[Verse: Montana of 300]
Like Doctor King I had a dream, my face inside a magazine
Sometimes I sit back and I think to when I didn't have a thing
Yeah
Birthdays was the worst days, til I got it crackin' with the flow like an earthquake
Dreamed then I woke up and I chased it
Didn't smoke or drink to ease my pain, I went and faced it
Had some ups and down but somehow I managed to stay strong
Told myself I just gotta make it way before Trey Songz
Made it to the top now you hate him because my cake long
Talking for no reason, no changin' me like a payphone
I took a shot and got shit crackin' like a bar fight
Sharper than a sharks bite
I had to play my cards right
I used to dream inside my head
I don't complain I grind instead
Bitch, I been listening, Simon Says
They beef with me you'll find em dead
Pray for forgiveness, climb in bed
I know they road like driver's ed
And when I road I took my bro
He had my back, that's riding pegs

[Chorus: No Fatigue]
I had a dream I took a shot, and I made it
People started hating, sneak dissin, wanna say shit
Dreamed that I was flexin, on the daily
Was broke then I was rich, yeah
Man that shit was crazy
Yeah I dreamed I was really up in first place
Yeah I dreamed that I made it out my birth state
Yeah I dreamed I was saucin' and they couldn't take it
Yeah I dreamed I was on and they couldn't say shit
I had a dream, yeah
I had a dream, yeah

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
When you next to blow, all these bitches wanna be next to blow
But when it rains the fake one's won't pop out like they umbrella broke
Keep on digging cause if you don't, my nigga you'll never know
Don't give up on your dreams
Listen to your heart like a stethoscope
I swear I used to pray for this, always knew I was made for this
My flow so hot, got Satan pissed
He's snappin' like I'm taking pics
Album sound like Greatest Hits
I lock shit down, no Jadakiss
And I stack up while haters diss
They taking notes like waitresses
40 cal, I stay with this
Don't think that I won't spray this bitch
I put that on my son
You know his daddy will, like Jaden Smith
Shoot whoever hackin, like them nights I got shit crackin
Caught a gun case for the ratchet
Then I beat it, Michael Jackson
Fresh to death without the casket
Drips sauce on them, get some napkins
Ike and Tina, my shit smackin'
Told my niggas let's take action
Time to push just like contractions
Be immune to all distractions
Mark my words just like a caption
We gon' take off with this rapping
Squad!

[Chorus: No Fatigue]
I had a dream I took a shot, and I made it
People started hating, sneak dissin, wanna say shit
Dreamed that I was flexin, on the daily
Was broke then I was rich, yeah
Man that shit was crazy
Yeah I dreamed I was really up in first place
Yeah I dreamed that I made it out my birth state
Yeah I dreamed I was saucin' and they couldn't take it
Yeah I dreamed I was on and they couldn't say shit
I had a dream, yeah
I had a dream, yeah
