Little mama sexy as she want to be
She want a pop that pussy for a G
Some big ol’ titties and that ass fat
Girl go on bounce it like a bad check
Reached in my pants and pulled my thang out
Girl go on and show me what that brain ‘bout
When I go in she scream my name out
She say she love me cuz always fuck her brains out
I always fuck
I always fuck
I always fuck her brains out
She say she love me cuz always fuck her brains out
I always fuck
I always fuck
I always fuck her brains out
She say she love me cuz always fuck her brains out

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
Finger ready I slide two inside
Pussy so wet that I could scuba dive
Say bitch I’m covered up with tattoos
Got my dick harder than a statue
She suck this dick just like a vacuum
I’m talking more brain than a classroom
I sat her on the sink up in her bathroom
I fucked her there then carried her into the backroom
I hit that ho hard like a running back
I pull her hair when I hit from the back
My baby ain’t gotta play with toys
She always cum when I be takin’ charge
Girl bite this pillow you keep making noise
I just put my sons to sleep bitch you might wake the boys
I stretch her out just like a La-Z-Boy
And she love daddy dick I ain’t no baby boy

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
If you know me you know I like to let the water run
Super soak that pussy squirt just like a water gun
And shawty like to scream my name out
I grab her neck hold up her legs and fuck her brains out
I suck them titties while she ride me
Her box got more juice than a Hi-C
She say it’s mine ain’t gotta ask her
When she ride it backwards shawty make that ass jump
Some big ol’ titties and a fat cat
I feel like Rico throw that ass back
This bitch got cakes like it’s her birthday
I make her shake just like a earthquake
Lil bitch so bad I had to spank her
Fucked up her hair, fucked up her makeup
I put this dick down like a anchor
That’s why she only pop that pussy for a gangsta
