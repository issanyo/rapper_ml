[Intro: Montana of 300]
Alright
Them niggas that you with, they don't give a shit about you
You say you with the shit, 'till i shoot the shit up out you
Nigga, imma shoot the shit up out you
Say you with the shits, 'till i shoot the shit up out you
My nigga, imma shoot the shit up out you
I'll shoot the shit up out you and than forget about you

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
I'm that nigga they hate on, my cake long they face long
I'm that same nigga i'm just cakey now, no changing me no payphone
Get money's my addiction, I stay strapped like Red Redemption
Fly as fuck is my description, flow so ill need a prescription
I'm that chi-town city slicker, flow colder than any nigga
Put you in a cast, for the mills, no Philly nigga
My niggas is really hittas, whenever them semis bligga
I shoot the shit up out you cats, bang bang, kitty litter
Fuck whoever birth you, it's nothin' for me to merk you
You and every single clown in that circus you call a circle
Yo actin' need some rehearsal, i gotta go in, no curfew
I come through yo door like Urkel and smoke you, granddaddy purple
God you know that i don't play that, you know that i stay strapped
Next nigga try me, imma send them to you ASAP
Like fuck who love him, fuck who knew that nigga
He tried it with me so i had to do that to that nigga
Fuck nigga don't start shit, we keep 30 in all clips
40 hit you in your face and turn you into harpe diem
My flow so hard i can't lie on it, my shit need a carpet
I was trained to go in like fire department
No denyin' my bars sick, i stay in some sharp shit
Every time i change my clothes, i get flyer than Clark Kent
Yo bitches on our dick, her head game retarded
Bet i shoot off in her mouth, like her tonsil my target
I go ape bitch call me Caesar, i'm serious as a seizure
And when this dick up in her face, man yo hoe know the procedure
I swear she got my dick hella hard, my magnum like extra large
Shawty was so bad I had to hit her, domestic charge
Fuck my enemies, I hit the scene they pissed as me
Gold chains like i'm Mr. T, wrist froze look like Mr. Freeze
Bad bitches want dick from me, dirty boy they diggin' me
Old hoes sendin' texts while i'm flexin say they missin' me
Shout out to them niggas I done bodied, yeah they history
See it was either them or me, i wiped away they memory
Another unsolved mystery, and police ain't got shit on me
And if i go to jail you still ain't safe all of my killers free
And if i can't get to you, it's nothin' i'll have my man approach ya
Black hoodie, black ski-mask, and a toaster
Come and rob you for your life, pussy hand it over
Pop a hole in your top, like a can of soda
Mask over, i'm takin' your planet over
This that shit your general and lieutenant should panic over
I merked him along with you and than turn into commander soldiers
Like, do what i say, 'for i shoot in your face
I'm Kobe Bryant with that iron, i got that shoot first mentality
I don't talk, my gat it'll speak, i get at you like allergies
I'm outchea on my fuckin' grind, never leave my gun behind
And for that i'm facing time, and might be forced to leave my sons behind
My nigga, i will fuck yo life up
Boy, i been 300 since the motherfuckin' Chrysler
You pissed about this shit, you should be wearing a diaper
That chopper get to spittin', you would think it's in a cypher
I do this, and ain't nothin more important than the mula (than the mula)
Shoutout J Real (shoutout J Real), yeah that's my shooter
He keep that steel, i tell him drill that's what he do, yeah
We get it poppin' (bang, bang), 4th of July
I come and get you while your sleepin, Freddy Kruger
I keep that ooh im at the scene, bang, do ya
I pull that tool out, put it to ya, it go booyah
First they bag him, toe-tag, and slide that nigga in a cooler
I'm that nigga ya heard, well equip with them burners
I got bodies and bars, like i'm in prison for murder
These other niggas just rappin', nigga this how i'm livin'
Life so cheap in my city than anybody could get it
