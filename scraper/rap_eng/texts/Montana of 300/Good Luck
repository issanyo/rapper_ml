[Intro]
B-B-B-B-Benson

[Chorus]
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas
Broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
I wish nothin' but luck to you niggas
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas (Uh huh)
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas (Uh huh)
I broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas (Uh uh)
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
Good luck to you niggas

[Verse 1]
We was a team, we was all strong
When them checks came, we was all on
I told you to go put your money up
You ain't listen, you handled it all wrong
Now you wanna switch up 'cause it's all goin'
You ran when it got rough, now my dog doomed
From the biggest favors to a small loan
Nigga I was the one you could call on
And even though my fans paid to see me perform
I made sure I shared my stage with you
'Coulda had you standin' on the side by the DJ
Waitin' for the day that they pay for you
But that ain't how I rock, that's why I let you rock with me
All 'cause I want you to make it too
Put my money and time and my faith in you
They say that no one that quits ever makes it through
Shootin' dice while we tour, laughin', crackin' jokes
I guess when the weak folds then they gotta go
Won't hold you hostage, give you what you're askin' for
Just keep on spazzin', don't go back to trap and dope
All I did was show you how to get it, nigga
But you couldn't stay the fuck out your feelings, nigga
You let people put poison inside of your ear
And tricked you right up out your position, nigga
Name a guy that showed more love to you than I
When you didn't have shit I gave you a job
I told you do you like I'm do or die
Had free time in the stud' you didn't utilize
When you quit felt like you commit suicide
Man, our cyphers were illa than U of I
It's just sad that you couldn't see through the blinds
I hope you and your family are doin' fine

[Chorus]
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas
Broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
I wish nothin' but luck to you niggas
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas (Uh huh)
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas (Uh huh)
I broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas (Uh uh)
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
Good luck to you niggas

[Verse 2]
I know niggas envy, but just like a belly
I'ma be up front with you niggas
I shared valuable wisdom and knowledge
I just hope that shit stuck with you niggas
If the opp started up, just like a garbage truck
Woulda pulled up and dumped for you niggas
I'd roll up, light 'em up like a Dutch
No homo, but you know I done touched a few niggas
Niggas wasn't loyal, I still got love for you
But I cannot fuck with you niggas
I just pray that the niggas I'm with is legit
And ain't none of 'em cut like you niggas
Niggas talk like they real 'til it's goin' down
Get discouraged as soon as that storm sounds
Yeah, I had niggas fadin' on Georgetown
You was ballin', you watchin' the scores now
Said you wanna get hype on the goal line
You the type to give up when it's fourth down
Tried to run with the fuckin' clout, you took another route
Didn't know it would lead to a fuckin' drought
Mama told me, "Them hoes gonna swear to you
That nigga, they gonna wanna get next, too
And watch all the niggas you next to
They might just be there 'cause they wanna flex, too
Happy for you or happy they met you
You give 'em money, but give 'em a test, too
If you was fallin', how many gon' catch you?
Say you gon' eat or see who gon' say F you
In due time they'll see what made you special
They was never with you if they left you
But reality's what we ingest, too
Superman can't come to everyone's rescue"

[Chorus]
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas
Broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
I wish nothin' but luck to you niggas
All I did was show love to you niggas
You know that I kept it a buck with you niggas (Uh huh)
You down and you stuck, you know I'm pullin' up
I guess I was too clutch for you niggas (Uh huh)
I broke bread from the jump with you niggas
Shouldn't have never put so much trust in you niggas (Uh uh)
My friendship you're missin', no this not a diss
Good luck to you niggas
