Verse
I been ballin
Could've skipped college
I'm a bad boy with that big popper
12 gauge when I head shot him
Bust his head open like a pinata
Like Percy Miller I've been bout it
Come find your ass like Bin Laden
I kill a clown over my guala
Don't give a fuck if it was 10 dollars
Don't trust niggas don't trust bitches
I know these ho's like a pimp scholar
And it's MOB till the day I drop
And these stupid thots don't get nada
And these dick riders try to steal from me
Gon feel the heat when that lead pop em
I whack a bitch and then walk away with blood on my shoes that's red bottoms
Bought a new gun with two clips
I can't wait to use it
And that bitch stick to my hip like I glued it
I hope you do trip as soon as you do it
I'll pull that bitch out K-9 unit
And kiss your ass goodnight, like, (bang bang) that's smooches
No top that's clueless
I'm ruthless, I do this
I'm ballin these ho's, yeah, they all on my pool stick
And you mad at your main bitch cause that bitch bumpin my new shit
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
I can see you pussy like a miniskirt
Keep talkin you gon get it first
And the toughest with you gon' get it worst
Now go order up about 20 shirts
RIP with they face on it, had to show they ass how that semi work
Yeah they got smoked April 21st
The next time you see 'em gon' be in a hearse
Always sayin somethin' but ain't sprayin nothin'
When it's beef I don't wait for nothin'
If I see a opp broad day in public
Then I'm shootin shit like Azae Production
Got word they be out there every night
I'm talking deeper than Barry White
We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White
They catching bullets, he Randy Moss, he Terrell Owens, he Jerry Rice
And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
I roll up like a blunt, I don't lurk bitch I hunt
Hoodie on like a monk, I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump
This bitch got kicked like a punt it usually sit in my trunk
But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
I'm a dough stacking
Dope rapping, no lacking
Po' packing, Four blasting
Soul snatching, toe tagging, cold bastard
Better close your mouth or get a closed casket
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in two, make them disappear, when I spit fire, that's old magic
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
Might fuck his bitch or say fuck this shit, and get straight face, that's no passion
I'm the illest nigga that you ever heard
I'm the flyest killer that you ever seen
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Okay fuckboy you softer than Nerf
I'm lurking all through your turf
That semi pop and start sending shots
I'll put you in a box like Houdini
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't give a fuck who see me

Hook
And Now we are gathered here today
To hate and to listen to what Montana gotta say
I swear you don’t want to witness this savage in ya place
He’ll come and ravage where you stay
Slap bananas in that k and put them blammas in ya face
