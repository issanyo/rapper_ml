I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco

[Verse]
Click clack, beef with me? That's a no no
When I kick doors they like, oh no
Bitch I make neighbors call the Po-Po
(Boom Boom Boom) He catching bullets like he Ocho
Yall won't see that pussy no mo'
Caught my first body with a four four
I fucked his bitch and gave her slow strokes
Pussy is okay but I'm in love with the throat though
Break bread with broski but be quick to tell a ho no
No Young Thug, that's no homo
Bitch where was you when I was broke though?
No we can't kick it stupid bitch, this ain't no Dojo
Like hockey rinks you know the flow cold
I run this bitch you would think I'm coaching Flo Jo
Get fucking paid like a  ho stroll
Stay in the field with them poles like a goal post
Was selling bud for the low low
Reggie, mid, I even sold dro
Still independent, got more wisdom than the old folks
Stop selling drugs now I get 10k for a show though

Bitch I'm Lebron, I'm way ahead of my time
Fuck who ain't rocking with me
Compared to you niggas, Tony is way ahead of you niggas
You don't need binoculars to see
Bad yellow bitch and she driving for me
40 cal under the passenger seat
Like D Wade, since day one been riding with the heat
Had to do what I did to survive in these streets
You already know if you don't grind you don't eat
Can't take no more L's, don't got no time for defeat
Ainâ€™t get help from nobody, so I went and got it
I'm honest nothing was promised to me
Ain't no stoppin' my shine, to the top I'mma climb
Hope I make on time for my mama to see
My brain is bionic, atomic, I guess I can come and teach you about astrology
Fan say they love when I'm riding the beat
I'm good with the flow, I can mop, I can sweep
See niggas be hating then hop in a whip with a bitch and she got the Rap god on repeat
Cursed With A Blessing on Itune right now, If you buy it you feel like you copping a ki
Back in 08' I was copping them P's
Now I get paid just to hop on the beat
Someone tell DJ Drama to holla at me, I Jeffrey Dahmer a beat
Go talk to the Devil and ask him who is he
He'll tell you that he wish he was hotter than me
I'm armed in this bitch, Iverson rocking the sleeve
Goofys get popped when I squeeze
Although I'm cool as a tropical breeze, I will let this bitch blow like a thot on her knees
I feel for you niggas like I can not see
I shoot like Ray Allen when popping the three
Stop and pop up from the top of the key
Don't want problems with me, bitch I got what you need
I don't twitter beef, boy them choppers will speak
Come to your crib and then rock you to sleep
Body your ass then hop in the jeep, boy that 187 ain't mean nothing to me
Slide on them at night, they pajamas to me
Get popped in your noggin, your partners retreat
Every move I make them piranhas with me
I promise you don't want to collide with a beast
So fuck what you thought
We gonna outline these squares up in chalk like they playing hopscotch in the streets
When I come with them goons ain't no goblins with me
There ain't no way in hell you're surviving the heat
Broski know how it goes
We done been here before we gonna kick in the door and then pop them on three
I been popping niggas, my big poppa spitting
Bitch I got that Christopher Wallace with me

Just bought a mac to flip you niggas like a laptop
Get in my face watch me shoot it like a bad shot
This shit like Nicki, get your ass shot
You know I'm bodying that bitch like a mascot
Extended clips holding three O
Watch me shoot them like a free throw
My 40 singing like it's Ne-Yo
That's bullet holes in your whip, now you Cleo
You know I ball like a peep hole
Chain swinging like It's Debo
I make them piss like a PO
All their hair falling out, chemo
I'm taking over, bitch I'm taking over
I'm taking over, bitch I'm taking over
Do them like I did the last nigga
Shoot them through the glass nigga
