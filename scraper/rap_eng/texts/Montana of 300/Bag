Shout out my squad
I never had shit
Made it out of the hood, now I'm doing good and got me a bad bitch
I pull up in a fast whip
Don't call unless you talking cash shit
So come with that bag, cause I'm in my bag
I stay in my bag bitch
(2x)

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
See me
I put God first and he put me in this position
I made it up out the hood
I had to complete that mission
See everything is expensive
I'm in my bag like magicians
I am, of no religion but my Louboutins are Christian
Fly Guys they can't tell us shit
Money team, Mayweather shit
Wings up, bitch I'm Pegasus
This what we do, no predicate
Sauce everlastin'
These bitches feeling my fashion
I just bought a Mac 10
It pop make an op do a back bend
Graaa!

[Verse 2: Jalyn Sanders]
Don't ask me shit about my bag won't let you hold that
I stack it up, don't spend a dime can't even ford' that
Bitch bad like Dennis had some [?] when she throw it back
She cut it, I count it up
If its my money I'm so in love
Switching lanes in the foreign
Haters mad, can't ignore it
These bitches piss like a toilet
Dripping all the sauce, they done stole it
Shout out my squad yea, we eating we some carnivores
Straight to the money, we ball out my ACL just tore

[Verse 3: Talley of 300]

Look I'm an 80s baby, momma sayin' these streets raised me baby
But now we made it baby
Never knew how much they hated baby
Came a long way, remember I used to go crazy baby
With that lil .380 baby
Open out and got to pay me baby
Flipped the money make it stretch
Like I'm coaching for gymnastics
Got it cracking like a egg
Now my pockets on Jurassic
Got and went and got a bad bitch
Got her looking like a actress
For fame and the name shame, I was making hits like I'm Cassius
Had to be a pusher
Now I just got pulled like a wagon
Reptile I spit acid
I'm eating, got green like some cabbage
Haters be mad sick
Give bitches more wood than a cabin
And they worry bout' jack shit
They itchy on my like a rash bitch
Got stripes like a ref
Chip swag in my bag
I might go and cop the vette
Just so I can do the dash
I'll burn your chest, if you doubt fire, then its tootle doo to the cash
I don't see the truth in you like a [?]
But just know my shooters shoot when I ask
POW!
