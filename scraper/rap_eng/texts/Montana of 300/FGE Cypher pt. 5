[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Yeah
TO3

Im on these niggas necks
Like their fuckin' heads
And I don't care what you rep
I'm too much to press
Step down and get swept down
Like fuckin' stairs
Leggo my eggo, how I like cuttin' squares
One click I'ma load a clip, I'm about to go live
Get spent like 90 cents, that's two shots from the 45
That way they can't drop no dimes, get it?
Thats a hunnid nigga no lies, like a nigga really know God
Livin, but the truth said so free and I'm so fly
I walk in a spirit, like I was born a ghost
And I'm no magician, but I'll get you gone in smoke
Dock like you on a boat, see headshots in your horoscope
Boy I'm rock like boilin' coke
Ever think that you can horn a goat, better realize you on a slope
Shit'll go down, like bundles we roll out
Red dots on your nose, clown
Fireman, you get hosed down
Watch you shake like it's cold out
Hail Mary on the go route
How we scorin, who runnin'
We always go 100, yeah
And the worst when I catch up and leave you like I'm forgettin' something
And then I get back to my sense, I mean, it's back to the money
Legend on the mic I preserve, then wrap it like a fuckin' mummy
And I do it for the ones who love me
And those who came out that muddy
Want change, haters get the nickel
Thats the thing, it cap for the dummies
See, levelin' up it's a specialty
Go hard or go home it's the recipe
I been outcast like a refugee
Know that water like I trot the seven seas
So I plan to ball hard in every league
On guard with them clips like I'm beverly
Callin' all the bullshit like a referee
And I kick this shit off like a special team, squaa

[Verse 2: No Fatigue]
FGE shit man, y'all know how squad comin' man
'Tigue shit
I'm at that door like an usher
Feel my balls like they punctured
It's No Fatigue on the beat
Go follow me no instructions
My niggas movin' with structure
Be patient, niggas be rushin'
Streets not a game, this ain't pixel
I hope that you owe us something
Just bought some new poles, they came in just like a rookie
If she mine, I don't trip, I go Luscious for my cookie
I'm Mighty Joe when I'm Young, that bitch wanna fuck with me
Yo bitch said she want the D, oh, watch out for that tree
I be feelin' like I'm Caesar it ain't mini just like me
Smarter than what you think, I get shit done in a blink
Gotta hit her with that tommy, bring that power where you sleep
R.I.P. Prodigy I be with Mob, like I'm Deep
Won't spend on niggas like linen
Flex on 'em from the beginnin'
Talkin' bout hoes on my dick, I got a lot like a dealer
He cross me leave him in hot sauce, no I can't go like I'm blocked off
Bitch I go in like the locks off, hoes try lock me down like I'm popped off
Niggas change just like majin buu, up like in Chyna
Send him he shootin' and robbin' you
First they start jockin' you then they start mockin' you
Hatin' and tryna put a stop to you
Niggas be lame anyway, step on squares and light 'em up, MJ
Then I go blow on some MJ, this shit you hit get the rent paid
She slide me that cookie and I give yo baby D
She up in here tryna mate with me
Not in my circle then you get that K on me
Do not come get in my way on me
Didn't fuck with me until I got glow
I cuff that bitch like the waist on me
I bet them niggas gon' hate on me
I bet them bitches gon' wait on me

[Verse 3: $avage]
Yeah!
FGE shit, Mob shit
You know we run this shit

You know what it is, big pimpin' since a little nigga
Life's a gamble, I just get my cards, and I deal with it
Shake them haters off, take that shit just like a boss
I lost homies I lost money but I never took a loss
Comin' from the jungle with them alligators no Lacoste
Come through all black like the Raiders throwin' bullets, Derek Carr
Long range, and you bitches know my name
If you wanna play them games with me
Nigga you can die, like it's Saw
Put them targets on yo jaws, put your brains on the walls
Just so I can see that goofy ass shit that you thought
Knock you off and beat the case, they catch me I do the race
Real shit, Will Smith I'm an enemy of the state
I got hitters in the NO they blitzin' shit like the Saints
Do this shit so confidential, knock you off them tinted windows
Wash it down return the rental while I'm laughing to the bank
Big cash, big gold chain, chrome pistol
Fly Guy, sub-zero 'cause a nigga kicks cold
Niggas change, bitches change, you know how this shit go
Live fly, if a nigga try, put him in the sky
On these beats, ain't no other niggas eatin' like mine, squaa

[Verse 4: Montana of 300]
Rap God, FGE shit man
You already know what it is man
CP5 in this bitch man

I spit fire like Pete's Dragon
Got more game than season passes
Stay up in expensive shit and I ain't talkin' Caesar's Palace
Dress and drip no caesar salad
Haters mug ain't even savage
Lookin' hard no reading glasses
Easily could lead to caskets
I got this shit mastered like Leroy
I been in my glo like I'm Sho'nuff
These pussy niggas got no nuts
These niggas gayer than gold dust
Don't none of my shooters give no fucks
For they bread they gon' pop up with toasters
For that dough they put holes in you, doughnuts
You don't wanna meet up it ain't cold cuts
With this draco nigga I'm cold as ice
They disrespectful but when I show up I swear they so polite
I ain't with the talking big choppas on me no overbite
I bet I shoot the crap out them bitches like I was rolling dice
Turned 'em into packs, I had to murder me some cats
Left big shells on the ground that's Ninja Turtles on they backs
Bitch I'm saucy you just salty, I got flavor every season
And I'm ballin', bitch I got them blue faces like Lance Stephenson
I water the seeds that I've planted until I'm under Earth
I push my son on that court like he Jesus Shettleworth
Some winners fail but don't be a quitter, there's nothing worse
Possess a hunger so strong that your fucking stomach hurt
Rap God, I'm who they call the man, I'm so fly never gotta walk again
But if I ever do I just bought some land, I take all your bitches
Turn them all to fans
I be saucin' when I hit the mall with bands
Fifty thousand in my jogger pants
Keep the green on me like a Boston fan
Ballin' with my bros, Big Baller Brand, squaa!
