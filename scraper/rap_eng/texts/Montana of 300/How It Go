Fake Niggas Always Feed You Propaganda
Im About to go ape, shit I kill for my bananas
Rap game looked me in the eye
And said this big ole light of mine
Nigga im gonna let it shine
Yeah I'm One of a kind
And Im unsigned
And you can't underestimate a prodigy
Im all about my green, like broccoli
Im here to fulfill my prophecy
And honestly, you wannabes ain't stopping me
My flow sick, I need a vaccine
My bars heat, get yo sunscreen
When I pull up Ima have yo Dawgs Cause A Stampede
If you ain't Johnny bitch don't come across Cuz I kill niggas that cross me
You snoozing on me, I bet you never felt like you lost sleep
She call me Tyreese when I grab her by the WAIST then I go in DEEP
My guns speak, Their the only ones that are all talk
And I stay grindin' no skateboards no tony hawk
Nigga I'm the shit, my haters' full of salt
If you fuck with me, you won't like the result
I'll go in for murder not just assault
Man Im in this ho Kinda like golf
And she told me that yo dick is micro soft
These broke niggas be like
Another day another dollar lost
I spit heat, My flow cold, and my cold heart won't defrost

FGE the logo
I hop on tracks no pogo
I go loco for my dough though
Bitch I kick it like a dojo
I go nuts no low blow
Man but back when I was poor though
With no money for no polo
My OG was off that coco
Now Im 10k for a show though
Me lacking thats a no go
Run up on me thats a no no
I clap then I get low though
You get whacked, I gave you promo
Like D Wade I Keep HEAT on me But you know Im from the Go though
Okay, I got all these Haters
I got all these hoes
I got all this paper
I be ballin' like D Rose
I make a bad bitch leave a nigga
Tell em Adios
My Crib feel just like a strip club cuz nigga I got all these poles
I got hella Guap,And I got hella Thots
Sneak diss on me? Boy you better not
Let that metal pop, I don't ever box
Bitch it's Hammer time, I be nailing opps
When im poppin' shit, its an apocalypse
Man I shoot em up like a rocket bitch
You ain't stoppin' shit you ain't robbin' shit
Get yo noggin split, when them choppers spit, Squad
