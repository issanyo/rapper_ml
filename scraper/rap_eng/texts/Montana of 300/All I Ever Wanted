[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was to make a fucking difference
Knew a lot that never did it
Tryna be the one who did it
Grew up in the project building
Witnessed dealings and some killings
Devil grinning with how we living
Niggas sinning just to get it
Used to go to bed at night while watching roaches on the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because there wasn't enough dishes
Taught to share with all my siblings, If I got it they can get it
I remember watching my OG get high up in the kitchen
I remember finding pipes she hid up in the oven mitten
How I used to throw them out
The ninth floor window like I'm pitching
Then act like I never did it
Thinking that would make her quit it
I still pray to God for healing
If you're real I know you hear me (Ahhhh)

[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was to make it to the top
Used to look up to my Pops, and all he played was Big and Pac
I figured if I rapped like them well maybe i could get this guap
Put me on TV, I can't see me in no can or in no box
Never thought I had to hussle, never thought I'd tote these Glocks
Never thought I fight them cases, sleeping counties on a cot
Niggas think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me then bodies drop
Boy you dont want to be my opps
And I dont leave no witnesses so can't nobody can tell the cops
Niggas snitching, choppers take them out the picture when I crop
Never planned on popping pussies or nobody getting shot
But I ain't never complain about mine, Nigga you know how I rock

[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Bridge: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, was to give my people hope
And get their backs up off the ropes
Make my people proud, keep your heads above the clouds
Bought my momma a big ol' house, I just wanna see you smile

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was my OG off of drugs
Used to wash clothes in the tub, Never thought I'd be the plug
All I ever wanted was to make it with this rapping
First I'll trap and get to stacking and invest and make it happen
All I ever wanted to see my niggas shine
Never thought that you would be jealous
You was hating all the time
Had that fuck shit on your mind, don't know how you was designed
But the Lord didn't make me blind, I know how to read them signs

[Hook: Dallas Eli & Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good
