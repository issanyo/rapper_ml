[Hook]
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Before the rappin', the trap house is where I hung
Was outchea gettin' it, you could catch me in no club
But cared for none, I went for none, didn't give no fuck
I use to be the plug
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Was on my grizzy, we got hustlin' in our blood
Just put God first and never put nothin' above
Stop sellin' drugs, didn't wanna get took from our sons
I use to be the plug

[Verse 1]
Yo daddy use to be the plug
That's just how it was
Now I'm hustlin' with this rap shit, flow so hard it need a rug
I stopped sellin' drugs, but I'm still shinin' like the sun
Same niggas bump they gums
See me, then they bite they tongue
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Read more than most and soaked up knowledge like a sponge Like Daph and Rudy Huxtable, had pounds of bud
But before that had sandwich bags filled up with doves
Priorities, I had a handle like a mug
Was gettin' funds, didn't give a fuck bout havin' fun
Rather spend time with my son
Way before the buzz
Way before the fans
I was pullin' out the scale
I was addin' up them grams
I was duckin', dodgin' 12, on my way to get them bands
And I wasn't takin no L, kept a pistol in my pants
Been arrested, posted bail, got the fuck up out the can
Got a lawyer paid him well, had to get up out that jam

[Hook]
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Before the rappin', the trap house is where I hung
Was outchea gettin' it, you could catch me in no club
But cared for none, I went for none, didn't give no fuck
I use to be the plug
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Was on my grizzy, we got hustlin' in our blood
Just put God first and never put nothin' above
Stop sellin' drugs, didn't wanna get took from our sons
I use to be the plug

[Verse 2]
I started off with half a zone
Worked up to pounds of loud, from here then it was on
Made money in two cities like I had a clone
Was hustlin', ballin', with no job like Tommy Strong
Bad bitches and clientele blowin' up my phone
Wasn't never stingy, I showed love, put niggas on
Slide in my throne, strapped up, feelin' like Al Capone
Stashed .40 cal's in different rooms inside my home
I built that shit on my own
I wasn't like these other guys who didn't think or use they minds
Got high on they own supply, then fall off and wonder why
I was wise, I strategized
I didn't feed into them lies
I saw shit for what it was, son just open up your eyes
Let your setbacks be a lesson, that's a blessin' in disguise
There's more options for a black man than the bars or sellin' pies
I'm just shinin' light on the darkness of how your daddy lived
So you don't make the same mistakes, sellin' drugs like your daddy did
I love you

Yo daddy use to be the plug

Stop sellin' drugs, didn't wanna get took from our sons
I use to be the plug
