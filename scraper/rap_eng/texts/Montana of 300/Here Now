[Intro]
I decided to dedicate myself to hip-hop
And to everyone that's a product of it

[Hook]
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now

[Verse 1]
My conscious told me
Come like this and bring that pain wit’cha
Keep faith in God and make sure that you keep that thang wit’cha
You got a purpose
Don't sit around like these lame niggas
Y'all ain't the same
Jus’ cuz y'all came from the same trenches
If they ain't fight in that fire
Stand in that rain wit’cha
Then they ain't wit’cha
Don't let ‘em get on that plain wit’cha
Make sure the ones you call Broski Nem on that same mission
Stay alive and stay focused
Stay out that cage, nigga
Heart of a hustler
It's pumpin all in ya veins, nigga
Don't smoke or drink
But yo’ high is when you on stage, nigga
Remain humble
And blow up like a grenade hit’cha
And never change
No matter how hard the fame hit’cha

[Hook]
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now

[Verse 2]
I liberate when I illustrate
On my tribulations
When I go in, penetration
Triggers yo’ stimulation
Long as I'm feeding my brain
It ain't no limitation
The greatest flow in the building
I'm hip-hop's renovation
My day one homie jus told me
Tony don't give me Nathan
It feels amazing just seeing
One of my niggas make it
And then I thanked him
For being loyal and never changing
Remaining true and not being
One of dem niggas hatin'
I came a long way from rappin'
Inside of niggas basements
Promised my girl
Ima get us up out this situation
Cut back on sinning
And changed the way I was living
So my sons ain't have to come see they daddy in prison visitations

[Hook]
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now

[Verse 3]
Hip-hop ain't never seen such
They gon’ remember his wrapping
Like he was he was King Tut
Yo’ favorite rappers couldn't match me if they teamed up
It's FGE, bitch, we take pictures wit our Wings Up
I took the shot, I had to take to put my team up
I pushed some packs and made racks
And let them things bust
Flow like the Devil with sickle-cell
That's sick as hell
Rap God gone bless you
And rescue you like I’m Chip n Dale
Hip-hop ain't dead
Watch me save that bitch with my hard drive
It's only right
Cause she saved me from all my hard times
I can’t forget you
My heart and soul's what I give you
Uplift you with what I been through
And when U gone I’m gon’ miss you

[Hook]
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
