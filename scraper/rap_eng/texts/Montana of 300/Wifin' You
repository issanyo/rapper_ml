[Hook]
I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swear, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

[Verse 1]
You be my woman, my wife, I promise to love you for life
You got more juice than Sunny Delight
I'll be your plumber, give you pipe
See, she make me think I can sing, make me forget that I rap
She cook me breakfast on the stove, I slide my dick in from the back
I'm in love with this bitch
While she ride this dick, I be rubbin' her tits
Sometimes I can't help it, I think to myself
Man, this pussy so good, I might cum in this bitch
Say yes or say no, the decision is yours
Was gettin' lots of bitches, now mission abort
I cut bitches off like umbilical cords
Now come ride this dick cause it's yours
I'm ridin' with you to wherever God take us
The haters can't break us, girl let's stack this cake up
I feel on your booty while you do your makeup
I make time for you just like my name was Jacob
I don't ever worry cause I think you worthy
Like, James left the game, and I hung up my jersey
It's DBC gang, yeah that's why I talk dirty
And every time we bangin', you bust like my .30

I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

[Verse 2]
I used to have lots of hoes, shawty thought I was a pimp
See, she fell in love with my stroke, she ain't know that I could swim
She throw that ass back for a G, she know she fuck with a boss
I love when she cum on my D, hop up and she lick it all off
Got me gravitatin' with infatuation
Had to cut em' off, baby, amputation
Made that cancellation for a damn queen
Now my hands clean, baby, sanitation
Colder than winter, don't wanna lose her
She a winner, my favorite place is up in her
Slide in like a splinter, might treat that pussy like dinner
Legs in the air like antennas
Then climb up on top like a wrestler, she down for the count
Hold her leg up whenever I pin her
I cut like a dealer, my baby cum, I cum with her
Take care of that box, I deliver, she wet like a river
She drippin', we lit like a candle
I'm thumbin' the clit like I'm flickin' through channels
We switch positions, I spank her with no paddle
I came on her back like a camel, she shake and I rattle

[Hook]
I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you

Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
