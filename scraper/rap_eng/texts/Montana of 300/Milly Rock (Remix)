That beef with me ain't even nice
I got big guns, no need to fight
See my dark side then see the light
Nail his ass down Jesus Christ
Slide back the doors on that van shooting
I'm throwing bullets like Cam Newton
I'll Milly Rock when my semi pop
And this bitch spitting like Remy Ma
Rap God imma warn ya, imma bless ya, imma teacher
When they see your grass is greener fake niggas gone try to team up
Yea my pockets Johnnie Cena
I get paid off shows and features
Before that, sold pounds of reefer
Use to serve more than Serena
I got teardrops on my fingers
30 in my nina
This bitch sing like Selena
Take your block out like its Jenga
Then I watch them bitches fall just like August no Alsina
I watch the news with all my goons and then we laugh just like hyenas
White sheets on them niggas look like I just killed the Klan though
Now all his friends and famo bluer than Orlando
FGE for life Bitch, You know what that stand for
And everytime we step we be strapped like a sandal
They lock me and foe nem up, threw us in that can though
I bonded everybody out, got us out that jam though
They say I stay fly, I say I don't know how to land though
Don't play no instruments but I be playing with them bandz though
Doors up like a lambo, this remix for my fans though
My merchandise be selling, had to ship it like a damn boat
His bitch on my dick because she know that I'm the man though
She grabbed it like a handle then, blew me like a fan though
She like the way I fuck, I stroke that pussy like a banjo
And come up out that water and start bussin like I'm Rambo
Muhfuckers mad cause I Fuckin' gas , Every track I fuckin' spazz
Im bodying it like [?] I treat the beat like my punching bag
Paper, I chase it like that's who I bank with
I'm winning, I'm eating, everyday's a banquet
Take notes bitch no waitress I'm cut like I weight lift
Fuck 12 and they bracelets, My wrist game on cake mix
If my gun drawn, not erasing shit
We got one when that bass hit
I put that 30 to em, I tote big clips like Blake Griff
Bars back to back, no Drake diss
Im greatness, embrace this
Fire In The Church bitch, My album drop May 6
Squad!
