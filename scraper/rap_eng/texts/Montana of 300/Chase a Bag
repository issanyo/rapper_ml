[Chorus]
Started with a dream that's all I ever had yeah
Haters talking 'bout me I done made 'em mad, yeah
Now all I know is count my blessings count this cash, yeah
Too paid to chase a bitch so I'ma chase a bag, yeah
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag, yeah [x2]
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag
Chase a bag, yeah yeah, chase a bag, yeah

[Verse 1]
Started with a dream, now I swear to God I'm winning
I come from the bottom, nigga, look how my pockets sittin'
$50,000 in 'em, been chasing that bag since a youngin'
Cops and robbers, nigga
We chase a bag, yeah, we make 'em mad, yeah
We all lit around this bitch laser tag yeah
I count my blessings twice before I bless the mic
I check a bag like I'm catching flights
I'm in my bag right now I think they mad right now
See I was running round wild could have fouled out
Ooh child things are gonna get a little easier
Had to fix the antenna so the TV worked
Invested with the money off the weed he served
From the bottom had to grind 'til everything reversed
Word

[Chorus]
Started with a dream that's all I ever had yeah
Haters talking 'bout me I done made 'em mad, yeah
Now all I know is count my blessings count this cash, yeah
Too paid to chase a bitch so I'ma chase a bag, yeah
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag, yeah [x2]
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag
Chase a bag, yeah yeah, chase a bag, yeah

[Verse 2]
Life's way too short to take a break I had to make a way
Didn't wait for nothing I got shit done
Fuck niggas can't relate
I sold more zips to niggas in the 'hood than Bathing Ape
I got that swag I'm in my bag just call me Jake The Snake
They talk that shit but show respect
When we meet face-to-face
Might teach they ass about subtraction when I take away
From the bottom like some roots
Yeah me and God been in cahoots
My mama told me lock shit down
I said I will just like a boot
I'm like 2Pac I got the juice
And bitch I got more kicks than Bruce
I'm in Balmain bitch fuck a suit
I slide LVs all through my loops
I'm fresh as hell I'm bustin' moves
Gettin' to dough just like a coupe
I been had hoes like I was Luke
Your hoe wanna blow me like a nuke
She said she'll blow me like some soup
I told her blow me like a flute
Then she blew on me like I'm Duke
Gave me top just like a roof
If you want beef that's on my daughter
Like Kyle Korver I'ma shoot
This rapper smoke shit like he Snoop
And then get right back to the loot

[Chorus]
Started with a dream that's all I ever had yeah
Haters talking 'bout me I done made 'em mad, yeah
Now all I know is count my blessings count this cash, yeah
Too paid to chase a bitch so I'ma chase a bag, yeah
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag, yeah [x2]
Chase a bag, chase a bag, chase a bag
Chase a bag, yeah yeah, chase a bag, yeah
