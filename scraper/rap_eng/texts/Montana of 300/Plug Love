[Hook]
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love

[Verse 1]
Love with a boss
I got drugs, I got sauce
Keep a gun in my drawers
While I'm duckin' the law
Give a fuck what you thought
I'm like Russ when I ball
Shawty loves when I call
I'm the plug in a wall
Her family said that I was trouble
But you understood my hustle
You know I came from the struggle
We went through it like a tunnel
Coulda bragged, but you stayed humble
Wavy with more chips that Ruffle's
Hundred thousand in my duffel
Let you count it 'cause I trust you
My name was ringin' like a bell
But still she didn't let me nail
She made me wait just like a scale
I wanted to fuck her bad as hell
I loved her voice, I loved her smell
I loved her hair, I loved her nails
Yeah, she was fly and shy as fuck
I had to bring her out that shell
And all that hatin' from females
She see through it like a veil
When I took L's or shit was movin'
Like a snail, she didn't bail
When police came, she didn't tell
I went to jail, she sent me mail
She helped me up the times I fell
I had to cuff her like a twelve

[Hook]
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love

[Verse 2]
My mans watch me get at her
She got class and she got swagger
Tryna become shorty man
Like fourteen grams, I have to bag her
I told her, "I am the plug
And you gotta learn to adapt to
The way I move with this steel
And this weight is like I'm a tractor
I find you highly attractive
I swear I'm caught up in your rapture
Put my number in your phone
And feel free to hit me up after
And if you fall in love with me
I promise you I'ma catch you
And start a whole 'nother chapter
Flip money just like a spatula
She understands, like metaphors
We become one, like Megazord
That money callin', I press ignore
I'm slidin' in and out of that pussy like dresser drawers
Ridin' dirty with this 30, extra clips up in her purse
But when we get back to the crib, I put this dick up in her skirt
Duffel bags full of dirty money, baby count that cash twice
I used to life that fast life, but that was in my past life

[Hook]
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love with the plug
She single, got her fallin' like some ones in the club
Had to cuff her, and I told her from the jump what it was
I keep guns and some drugs
I'm the plug, yeah
She done fell in love, yeah
She done fell in love
