Hook

Tell a pussy nigga we don’t play round, from Detroit Michigan to chi town, no playgrounds we don’t play round no playgrounds we don’t play round (x2)


Verse (Felix)

Tell a pussy nigga we don’t play round
One of the realist niggas reppin’ D town
Boy we cop a pound just to break it down
Weed so loud it blow ya speakers out
You took the easy way I went a different route
Pussy talkin tough boy what you yappin bout
Put the foe Nickel up to yo snout
Then blat Blat blat blat blat
We runnin’ out the House
Fge and live Hype
Yeah Nigga what now
Got the diamonds drippin’ Water on me
Nigga bling Blau
I’m like a rap unicorn I kill you wit a freestyle
Take ya shot I’m goin’ Shaq when I grab a rebound
A superior Nigga boy you can’t ger in my bracket
Wanna take this shit to violence Brody tuckin’ the ratchet
I’m nasty wit it my nigga I got a habit
I take a beat and chew it up then put it under my mattress
Mr Felix undefeated other rappers is lackin’
Can’t ever lose that’s why the don is immaculate
I was ballin’ after school big bro was pumpin’ Then packages
Never worried bout a pussy send my Niggas to handle it
Dreaded nigga from the motherland
My niggas savagaes they kill you wit they hands
I’m creepin’ through the window like I’m Brotha man
We takin’ everything even the tv stand
Always perpin’ flexin’ for the gram
But when I caught you out boy you ain’t want the hands
Cookin’ up like we got pots and pans
I’m goin’ Bobby shmurda do my schmoney dance
Didn’t hear that pussy Nigga hold on come again
That’s what the fuck I thought somebody get ya mans
Took a Nigga chick and had to change up plans
Now we in my crib she scream like laurel lance
You niggas is amateur (you Niggas is amateur)
Yo bitch suck my banister (yo bitch suck my banister)
I woke up in Panama scene panoramic I feel like a chancellor
(Feel like a chancellor)
Shout out to 50 (shout out to 50)
Cause this is a massacre (this is a massacre)
I’m killin’ these rappers you niggas low caliber I’m the ambassador

Verse (Montana of 300)

When it’s war time bitch I’m really wit it
Big Draco it got 50 in it
I ain’t just a rapper bitch I’m really different
When I’m on yo heels no Achilles’ tendon
Bro gone drop me off then park up the block
Told em leave it I ain’t out in 20 minutes
Meet the real you then I’ll kill you
And whoever love you they gone really feel it
Big poppa blastin’ call that biggie spittin’
Bunch of hoes on em like he really pimpin’
Actin’ innocent when I really I did it
When I said I’ll kill em bitch I really meant it
All kinda clips and all kinda guns we be strapped up like the A team
Run up on em let the drake sing spray at his head like Behring
I keep a gun on me nigga
I’m ready for whoever come for me Nigga
I ain’t worried bout none of these niggas
Put that on my kids I be sonnin’ these Niggas
Fuck wit mine I’ll be huntin’ these Niggas
I hunnit round drum then I’m done with these niggas
This ain’t no joke man 4 nem gone smoke em
Then bro nem gone roll up a blunt of these niggas
I got a whole lotta choppas but you know the Draco my favorite
(Draco my favorite)
Although I’m fly like a raven I promise I’m not one to play wit
(Not one to play wit)
My Draco put in that work
I dance wit my shit when I play this
(And if I raise it)
I squeeze it and wave it
(BLATTT!)
Now his brains all over the pavement
(Uh huhhh)
