[Hook] (2x)
Pockets on swole, I’m so caked up
That paper don’t fold no bitch I’m so caked up
Married to money and we won’t wake up
Bitch this 300 and I’m so caked up

[Verse 1]
I’m that same nigga, I’m just cakey now
I do my thing nigga I done caught yo lady eye
I make them bitches wonder like a lazy eye
These hoes take me down they wanna have my baby now
Hey it’s Montana bitch, uh-huh that crazy guy
Cuckoo bird swagga on you naggas I am crazy fly
I’m all about my money so don’t play wit mine
Kidnap yo kids you won’t get to tell yo baby bye
Stacks of money in my hand, picture this like Instagram
I smack them bitches together like erasers then hit my dance
Swing my dreads like it’s my jam, only Ben Frank fit my pants
It’s FGE bitch this the fam, my chain oh god, my wrist god damn
Let there be light, I lift my hand it’s DON we twist our hands
I shine so bright, you wish I tanned
Bitch I stay fly, you wish I land
I get money wit my mans, you niggas broke my bitch got bands
Got yo bitch cheering in the stands, I balls out like I split my pants
(300! )

[Verse 2]
I’m ballin’ bitch, I’m a pro at this shit
Peep the snow on my wrist, shout out to the dough that I get
These hoes so on my dick, haters know I’m the shit
Four-Zero on my hip (Bang) so you know how it get
Aww this yo main bitch? I stuck my pipe in her
She blew on a nigga like some dice nigga
Niggas wit money this that shit you don’t like nigga
We throwin’ cake around this bitch food fight nigga
Hate me cuz I’m cakey I stay turnt up on the daily
Swagga drippin’ on the ladies dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
Got a house sittin’ on my pinky stretchin’ money like a slinky
I got bitches countin’ money like Stoney, Cleo, and Frankie
You want a feature better pay me flow so sick my shit got rabies
I am all about cash money like my name was Slim and Baby
Bitch 300 be gettin’ money like they say they be
Ask dem bitches bet they say he be all about C-A-K-E
