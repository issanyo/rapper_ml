I got them racks up in my jeans (Ballin’)
Man every time I hit the scene (Ballin’)
All the bitches surrounding me (Ballin’)
And I ain’t worried about a thing cuz bitch I stay with that thing
Don’t know what the fuck you thought I’m (Ballin’)
And every time I hit the mall I’m (Ballin’)
Sometime it’s just me and my dogs (Ballin’)
Yet I’m a ball until I fall
Stacking my money tall
I got them racks up in my jeans

[Verse 1:Talley of 300]
I Cross ‘em and drive hard then slam dunk a bitch
A penetrating pass cuz I don’t cuff a bitch
But for what it’s worth they treat me like a nurse
They say they got that wet wet I tell ‘em I can surf
And yeah bitch I’m ballin’
Me and my team hustle hard no stalling
We stay fly with high minds no falling
And only answer for that money and it’s calling
Player of the year watch me kick up a gear
If you hear them bitches cheer then I must’ve just appeared
I’m stone cold muthafucka another ones assumptions
Bitch we going for the ball man it’s time to get it jumpin’
Haters feelin’ my degree, I’m in another league
Runnin’ till the clock stop and never show fatigue
We get it from the bottom so shinin’ is not a thing
But get hot over that ice and you could fuck around and freeze
Cuz we outchea (Ballin’)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
Ay all the bitches feelin’ dude
After the game I’m that nigga they want to interview
I ball so fucking hard, I swear I should have my own tennis shoes
The number one question they asking  is what I finna do I said I’m (Ballin’)
Bitch right after you give me head I'm (Ballin’)
And when I hop up out the bed I’m (Ballin’)
And right after I get my bread then slide on just like a sled
Don’t know what the fuck you thought
Every time I hit the mall
When you see me wit my dogs or if I’m mackin’ to yo broad
My nigga I ain’t never slippin’
Keep that pistol by my draws
And if you tried you can dine on a boss I won’t get caught
You niggas mad cuz yall bitch want us
You niggas ain’t ballin’ yall benchwarmers I shit on yall
When I step out they say that nigga dress raw
I leave the scene like Mr. Clean they say that nigga just balled
I swear I’m (Ballin’)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Montana of 300] (2x)
I do this for my team ho
I should get a ring ho
I should be on the cover of slam magazine ho
You ain’t never seen tho, nigga throwing C-notes
I ain’t trippin’ bitch I got more chips than a casino
