[Hook: Jalyn Sanders]

She ride it like a stallion
When I hit it I be stylin
That money keep calling its piling
Pop bands baby I don't call it
Killin the ref don't get T'd up
When we touch down better ease up
No trickin just stacking that cheese up
No falling, i'm balling no ring
And it's no denying
I flex without trying
Your bitch keep eyeing me
I'm sick like a virus
I'm fly like a pilot
I can not hide it

[ Verse 1: Jalyn Sanders]

Can't you just tell I stay glo'd, yea
She wanna give me knowledge like an old head
And I'm willing to learn just like a smart kid
Girl, i'm gone rock it like i'm harden
Stay fly like an attendant
See my team winning, no losing, no benching
I'm never cold stay on that not to fucking mention
Got [?] waiting on me in Canada
Wanna kiss on my chest because i'm tatted up
It's two of them yea one of me
Don't matter let's add it up
I got them killers right beside me
So if you pull it then they shooting like they Spike Lee
So if you try, yeah
Everybody dies, yeah

Got a box up like an island
Where you can't  see it like violet
Trying to run it up like a RB
Clip hold a lot like a RV
Shawty talkin bout she wanna stay the night
Need it in the morning like coffee

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]

When I slide on these squares these bitches break they necks
Boy, I will take your queen like we was playing chess
Before we fucking she sucking D Generation X
My pistol under my pillow I have the safest sex
I got bitches up in Dallas
I be styling like a stylist
Robin Jeans full of thousands
Dripping dressing like a salad
I laid her down like a pallet
Doggy style it got me growlin
She moan I love the way she soundin
She can't take it throw the towel in
Now when she see me she be smilin
Her nigga hating like he Calvin
But I done snuck the 40 cal in
No ref I'm blowin' if they foulin
When we touch down bitch it's wings up
I got chips I could slide like a Visa
Sometimes I go slow then I speed up
No cups but your bitch just got D'd up
