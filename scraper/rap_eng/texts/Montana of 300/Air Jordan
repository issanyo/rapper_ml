Bitches wanna kick it like my name Chuck Norris

Got bitches on my heels like Forrest
If I hit her with the dack, my nigga its a wrap
I'ma have that bitch hooked like a chorus
Give the bitch more wood than a forest
I'ma cut her just like the surgeon
My swagga tight as a virgin
Just hit a lick on the vic, I'm splurgin'
Throw money like it ain't no limit
Two bitches on my lap thats kissin'
If you niggas keep sneak dissin'
Then my nigga, he gone shoot like Pippen
Love the game like Mitch, but I ball like Mike
Everybody take pics, when a nigga take flight
Shawty all on my dick, Like I'm finna say hike
I'ma hit that bitch like a nigga named Ike
These fuck niggas be hatin' hard
They move some, my tool bust
And I shine hard, cause I grind hard
And these thotianas be crew lovin'

My niggas icy like cool runnin'
Yo boo blush when I wink at her, we leave the club bout 2 some
Hotel room, with yo bitch, I go to sleep, yo boo suckin'

Hit that bitch, snooze button

Money stacked tall as the Eiffel, cockin' bitches like rifles
OK now shawty got her tongue out, uh huh, tongue out on a nigga like Jordan
Gettin top from a thot named Morgan
In the parkin' lot with the 40 in the foreign
Already cocked, tell the opps I ain't goin'
Shawty still blowin' don't stop keep goin'
I don't play around, i'll spray around, lay a nigga down, on top read the paper in the mornin'

Goofy, you Patrick Ewing
Uh huh, I love the game, and I'm tied to it
F.G.E. I'm signed to it
I'm with the shits, I don't sit the bench
I don't drive the lane, I glide through it
You ain't ballin', shame on you
Bitches on us, but they ain't on you
I'm in V.I.P., With yo ho on my lap
Get the ho a stack, make it rain on you

Come watch me ball like Spike Lee (Yeah!!)
Yo girl all on my dick, you shouldn't have came with her
