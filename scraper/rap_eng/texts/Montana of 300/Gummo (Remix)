[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
Shorty hit me up, she like "Tony pick me up"
She wanna lick me up, want me to beat that kitty up
Shorty thick as fuck, ass look like Nicki butt
She like her pussy ate, and she like her titties sucked
Don't ask me questions, uh-uh bitch this ain't no trivia
Cause I'll dub a bitch and I don't mean I'm 20 up
Was hustlin' in the trap, I used to bag that sticky up
Was moving ounces out that bitch just like a sippy cup
Pounds in garbage bags the bitches looked like missy uh
One thing about me had two bodies by age 21
These haters envious I love when they act really tough
Hit 'em with the pump it look like I shot Ricky up
I stay litty uh, saucy plus I'm drippy huh
You can't stick me up, bitch I keep the glizzy tucked
I'm Suge mixed with Pac, Diddy mixed with Biggie uh
I'm signed to myself, my net worth 8 milli uh
I do this for my fans, and for la familia
My daughter pretty uh, sweeter than Olivia
From the land of Larry Hoover nigga, keep a group of hittaz
Kill a opp while he fuckin' sleep I'm Freddy Krueger nigga
One shot'll lift him up and drop him like a Uber nigga
Cold blood I guess he poolin' nigga, family view a nigga
Told y'all I keep that iron close if he think I'm a joke
Air him out, like the dryer broke if he try to poke
Real nigga in this Gucci shit I made her coochie drip
I'm tatted up, like I'm Tunechi bitch made her leave who she with
She blew on me like I'm tookey bitch don't try no flukey shit
Cause this MC stay with the hammer but this bitch ain't too legit
Banana clips, when this uzi spit it ain't no fruity shit
Pop a opp, like a roofie quick kill all that goofy shit
Remember when, I was mad broke, before the cash flow
My OG, on and off that base, like an astro
Prayed to God for better days he gave me what I asked for
Rap God you see me goin' in, like a glass door
Every track I gotta spaz tho like it's my last tho
It's only snakes, in the grass so I cut the grass low
Niggas 12, acting like they mob, Donnie Brasco
Keep a stick, like a staff hoe go do the math hoe
Gun cases, tell 'em google that I always had pole
Couldn't wait to get it jumpin' like a fuckin tadpole
I'm just tryna be a dad tho don't be an asshole
Cause I'll switch back to my past, hoe, quick as Flash hoe
And if I pop up in that mask hoe, I'm on yo ass hoe
Glock 50's bitch we slash throats don't get yo ass smoked
Pick his top, like an afro then do the dash hoe
And if you hatin' bitch you better skate Lupe Fiasco

[Outro]
These haters envious I love when they act really tough
Hit 'em with the pump it look like I shot Ricky up
Go buy my album that bitch dropping on May 20th
Pray for the Devil and make sure you pray for Libya
