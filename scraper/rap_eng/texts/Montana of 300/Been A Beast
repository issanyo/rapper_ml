[Chorus]
Remember when I was hustlin', strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough, rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes
Remember when I was hustlin' strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough, rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes (B-r-r-r-ah)

[Verse 1]
These bitches want me to crack (Uh huh), because I look like a safe now
I'm not alone in my whip (Huh?), I keep a bad bitch with her face down
I wish a fuck nigga would trip, I'll bus' his ass like a greyhound
I will shoot while you lay up, don't play foul, you get boxed when I come through that's takeout (Woo!)
I had to fight a few gun cases, this rapper battle, no eight mile
I felt I was winnin' because I was sendin' and gettin' that money, no PayPal
Always did my dirt by my lonely 'cause I heard niggas be singin' like H-Town
Nowadays I feel like I'm Lil' Weezy so please don't make me pull a Drac' out (Yeah)
I came a long way, young nigga cryin' and sniffin', my mama gettin' high in the kitchen
I made up my mind that I cannot die in the trenches, I told myself I'm on a mission
To go get that dough off the clients, supplyin' the piff and invested in rhymin' and spittin'
I went through the rain hopin' the pain I was feelin' would disappear like a magician
Wasn't scared of the fire, I been through all kinds of conditions, I'm thankful I'm not up in prison
I wanted a Rollie, one with the diamonds that glisten, I had to get fly on them bitches
Wasn't worried 'bout haters, I'm slidin' with blickers and after that probably gon' slide in they bitches
Was squeezin' them tools and it wasn't no pliers I'm grippin', this boss used to fire them bitches

[Chorus]
Remember when I was hustlin', strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough (Uh huh), rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes
Remember when I was hustlin' strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough, rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes (B-r-r-r-ah)

[Verse 2]
No shirt on, bitch I'm tatted up, I never had good luck
Start baggin' up, shit start addin' up, bank roll's fat as fuck
Bitches lookin' while I'm passin' slow like, "There that bastard go"
Hop out drippin' like a fashion show, you play, you gotta go
Click-clack-boom! Let that ratchet blow, that 40 snatch his soul
Casket closed, them bullets hit his face, Michael Jackson nose
Now shit Gucci, my earrings say burr, had whores on me, no spurs
Was flippin' packs and ballin' like I'm Chef they can't change who we were (Nuh uh)
Back in high school on a half a day, I was crackin' bitches while they folks was gone
Little bad nigga, but his dough long, I was movin' grams, old folks home
I was grindin' like a slow song, had to sit still when the dope was gone
Pistol on my lap and both phones, wit' a cutie with me, not four zones, huh
Young nigga lit with his dogs (Dogs), hustlin', riskin' it all (It all)
He got back there we kickin' in doors (In doors), takin' your shit like a stall (Stall)
Big rims and tint on the car (Car), we was just livin' to ball (Ball)
Strapped up when we hit the mall, I ain't duckin' shit but the law

[Chorus]
Remember when I was hustlin', strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough, rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes
Remember when I was hustlin' strapped up packin' poles?
Spendin' money on expensive clothes, flexin' crackin' hoes
Stackin' dough, rollin' up on opps, lettin' ratchets blow
I been a beast, ask the ones still livin' and go ask they hoes (B-r-r-r-ah)
