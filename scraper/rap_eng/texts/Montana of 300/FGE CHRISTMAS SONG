Uh-huhhh

[Chorus: Montana of 300]
Dashin' through the snow
Pulled up in a Wraith
I come with that bag so you know a nigga paid
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes
Dashin' through the snow
Hopped up out the Wraith
I come with the bag so you know a nigga paid
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes

[Verse 1: No Fatigue]
Feel like Santa Clause, baby I got all the hoes
Cold ass nigga, bitches fallin' like the snow
On top yea no cold
Hoes on me no coat
I stay by the pole
Might light up your home
Fly just like the sleigh
She look at me, glad you came here
Prance on over here, get on this dick and make it rain dear
Come and sit it on me
Tell me what you want for Christmas
I'm gon' put it down like I wrote it on my gift list


[Verse 2: $avage]
Hotbox full of smoke
Dashin' through the snow
Shawty smelled my Christmas sweater she already know
She gon' give me head underneath the mistletoe
And that molly in my sock, we call it stockings full of coal
Pocket full of dough, try to take it no you won't
Lay a  nigga down, that's a angel in the snow
Heater in my coat baby, so I'm never cold
Like a Eskimo, baby, I stay by the pole

[Verse 3: Jalyn Sanders]
I run it up, don't get no sleep until I got a bag
I got them hitters, slide like a sleigh, I'm pop em' like a tag
Put em in the bag, put em in the past, smellin fresh like a drag
Skirt off in the wraith, do the race
Talkin' like a Migo, do the dash
I'm cold and on point like a ice pick
She freaky, she naughty on my list
Bands in my pants call it shoplift
I'm fly like an angel I'm super lit
I'm singing so much slowly like the snow
When she get it call her Rudolph, she gon' glow

[Chorus: Montana of 300]
Dashin' through the snow
Pulled up in a Wraith
I come with that bag so you know a nigga paid
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes, yeah
Dashin' through the snow
Hopped up out the Wraith
I come with the bag so you know a nigga paid, yeah
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes, yeah

[Verse 4: Talley of 300]
You know I got that bag with me I came to play
Yo bitch wanna ride, heard bout how I slay, yeah
Bitch I'm suited up, big strap on my waist
I stay by the pole, it get colder everyday yeah
Light up like Christmas nigga
No Saint Nicholas, I'm gifted nigga
All year I'm uplifting niggas
I don't ever part from this spirit nigga
Got haters green, pissed until they meet the Grinch yea
I'm probably, what on they bitch Christmas list
No mistletoe, she want to give it a kiss yea
No candy cane, but I let her lick the stick
I end fast but I start slow
Beat it up, harpo
No message back, Morse Code
Jack frost my heart cold

[Verse 5: Montana of 300]
Told myself as a kid that when I get older I'm gonna get
My kids everything that my moms and pops couldn't afford to get
Now all year round, I buy my sons and daughter all sorta shit
Lit like Christmas trees, bitches wanna hang like an ornament
I'm on my glow like I'm Rudolph
I swear you fuck niggas too soft
These bitches feeling my whole squad
We get to bussin, no shoot-off
She wanna be where my shows is
She wanna know how the pole is
She say she wanna come sit on me
She want to me to slide down her chimney
I got that bag like I'm shopping
Move with that steal like the Grinch
Cuz I know them haters be watchin'
And I'ma slide with no problem
Fuck niggas know how I'm rockin'
You don't want me and my helpers
Inside yo house with them stockings

[Chorus: Montana of 300]
Dashin' through the snow
Pulled up in a Wraith
I come with that bag so you know a nigga paid
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes
Dashin' through the snow
Hopped up out the Wraith
I come with the bag so you know a nigga paid
Saucin' with my bros
I stay by my pole
I'm like Santa Claus, baby I got all the hoes
