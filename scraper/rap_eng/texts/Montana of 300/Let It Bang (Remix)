[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
You like hoppin' out on them Lakers, ballin' out on my baby
Drop top Mercedes, what you want, my baby?
Fuck around with my baby, I go bang bang for my baby
Switch lanes with my baby, sip lean with my baby
Countin' up goin' crazy, stackin' up with my baby
Hit the mall with my baby, blow it all on my baby
You is just a stain to a nigga
And she gon' let it bang for a nigga

[Hook: Fetty Wap]

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
I swear to God I'm gon' keep it one hunnid with you
I been that nigga, yeah I use to hit a bunch of bitches
But now I'm grindin' with my baby, fuck them other bitches
They just be hatin', wishin' they could be in her position
I tell them bitches fast forward, no rewindin' that
Shorty like my .40, I'm the clip, I'm 'bout to slide in that
Montana turned that pussy to a pool, and then I dive in that
No trap house, I grind in that
Jewelry on, I'm shinin' that
I'm the one she cater to
My baby be hater-proof
Strapped up while we skatin' through
I promise I won't play with you
My pass her that pistol, then pull up and let my baby shoot
Blow your top off, raise the roof
You bitches know my babe the truth

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Don't fuck 'round with my baby, man I swear she let it
And when it come to money, all we know is get it
And we gon' grind hard but we gon' shine together
Don't fuck 'round with my baby, man I swear she let it
Bang, bang, baaang, bang
Don't fuck 'round with my baby, man I swear she let it
Bang, bang, baaang, bang
Don't fuck 'round with my baby, man I swear she let it
Bang, bang, baaang, bang
Don't fuck 'round with my baby, man I swear she let it
Bang, bang, baaang, bang (Bang, bang, baaang, bang)
