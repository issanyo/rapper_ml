Fa a couple hunnids, nigga you can get yo life ended
We can drown the block, pull up masked, with all the windows tinted
Yeah, masked up like we surgeons, my legacy is emergin
We pull up on any lurkin, to pop em open like virgins
Remember when I was hurtin, couldn’t find god but I was searchin
All that pain it had a purpose, all that grinding now it’s worth it
Niggas rock wit us, claim they real, but playing both teams
Make sure we get them pussies from all angles like a porn scene
Gotta secure the bag and make sure I’m always strapped
Cause they done took my niggas, no I can’t get em back
Jump suit with the grip on a pole like ma niggas running track
Glizzy tucked in my sweats and that big choppa resting on ma lap
Paper on top of paper, I set plays like I’m the quarter back
That iron go reckless, don’t do no talking while I’m holding that
Buddy looking at me and he thinking I’m next
Til the thought was reciprocated and hollows eating chest
I made this shit out of nothing and got every reason to flex
And I’m on these niggas heads I think I got a few in this tech
No sympathy fa no nigga, leave the scene with bare expressions
I don’t joke with niggas, clips longer than bitches hair extensions
I don’t even pay attention to shit lacking an @ or mention
Sad that I gotta pop up and pop off, just to release the tension
Raid a nigga shit like the insecticide
Blow his shit back leave his whole entire head section wide
Sticked up like the feds ma nigga see our collection prime
Product of environment, 810 is where connections ride
On a mission, dropping niggas that’s blocking ma tunnel vision
Niggas switching, said they’d never change, nigga can see the difference
Brought the Drummond, with my niggas, think that I’m rolling with Pistons
Man I been about this shit, dripping sauce and pumping ambition
I take all the shots, no need of assistance, think I’m Kobe
I done did a lot of shit, I know karma gone bring back on me
Try to up the score on us, send that shit back just like a goalie
Never put trust in these hoes man I wish I listened to brody
It’s a shawty on that tip, she said she love me, bitch stop
Just come through for a quickie, get fixed up like pitstops
Show me momma raised a freak, clapping soon as that ass drop
Deep stroking in that pussy and kill her with backshots
Aye, I’ll go to war for my family, no I am not afraid
You don’t know how many days I stayed up and prayed fa change
It be the ones on yo turf that’s praying fa you to fall
Keep my guard up, realized most of you niggas ain’t real at all
Said go to war for my family, no I am not afraid
You don’t know how many days I stayed up and prayed fa change
It be the ones on yo turf that’s praying fa you to fall
Keep my guard up, realized most of you niggas ain’t real at all. ​
