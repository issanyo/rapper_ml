[Intro - Jalyn Sanders]

[Verse 1 - Montana of 300]
I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
Mr 40 bang kicking niggas damn door
Up this bitch on everybody hit the damn floor
If you love your life you better let them bands go
I was out here tryna get it being broke I can't go
I ain't never lacking I stay with the damn pole
30 and this 40 I feel like I'm Rambo
They know I've got bodies they don't want no damn smoke
I used whip the Chevy sitting on them damn 4s
We strapped up in the club pistols on the dance floor
Now I'm 5k for a feature 10k for a damn show
Started from the bottom got it off the damn floor
Still gripping on my pistol I ain't never lettin' go
And I can ride with my baby
I'm just at the mall I'm getting fire with my baby yeah
And no bitch fine as my baby
Pussy soaking wet can't wait to slide in my baby yeah
Looked in the eyes of my baby
And told her that I love her I'd die for you baby yeah
Bonnie and Clyde with my baby (uh huh)
Shawty down to ride, committing crimes wit my baby (hey, whats up, hello)
I remember back in the day when I was bagging up country
I started trapping for money now I'm rapping for money
They say I snap and go dumby it's a wrap like a mummy
Ain't gotta mack to the honeys that comes naturally to me
And bitch I carry Glocks I done buried ops
So pussy come and get your cherry popped
Bet I wet a nigga like a fucking pool
When I catch a body like belly flop
I'm poled up with bronem
Count show money at the Marriott
Like fuck a deal I'm already hot
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Some might sit and wonder like "why he be on that savage shit"
But they don't know the half of it
Growing up not having shit
Momma off of crack and shit I'm at school being bad as shit
In front of the projects bumping backward flips on matresses
Grew older, weight on shoulders I start hustling and baggin' zips
Whole time I was trapping I was mastering this rapping shit
With hopes our sons would never have to hustle like their daddys did
That's why I'm so passionate
I used to imagine it
I'm so talented I got niggas who hate me blastin' it
Planet of the apes me and broskinem tote banana clips
My partners posing pictures with pistols call that a action flick
I told 'em fuck proving to them pussy niggas we packing shit
And taking pictures with theyself snitchin' bro that's that backwards shit
Start whackin' shit the rest'll start vanishing like a magic trick
Who better than me your hypothesis is inaccurate
So it don't really matter your favorite rapper's inadequate
Cause once I get to snappin' immaculate meets extravagant
I'm Maximus, Achilles and Spartacus mixed with Gannicus
Invested in myself just like vending machines with shades I'm stackin' chips
Go holla at KP 'fore I show ya broski my management
Big paper in pocket 'bout to fall out
So many fans can't even shop inside the mall now
Oh bitches see me on, oh they wanna call now
Shout out my haters who keep Tony dick in your mouth
You diss on me, me and my hitters up in your house
Caught a body, took the pistols to my dog house
Shawty riding for me I lay back she ride it for me
And understand that I'm the man and hella bitches tryna fuck me
Even though I am a killer she still love me bride of Chucky
And if she's poetic justice well I guess that I am lucky
She's my numero uno I don't know what you bitches think
She like me and just like me she don't smoke and she don't drink
She stay focused and her flow sound like a boat so we don't sink
Three hundred dollars worth of groceries got it all off of her link
Head fire, pussy good and you know that pussy pink
When I slide up in that pussy keep me warm just like a mink
Set that bitch up on the counter fucked her on the kitchen sink
And when I'm done she always bring me a wet towel and something to drink
And I'm like (ahh)
And she go hard for her nigga
See shawty held me down when times was hard for a nigga
Rent me cars, crack me cards bring it all to a nigga
If it's a foul yo she gon' take the charge for her nigga
And if I pass the pistol she gon' spark for her nigga
Up that iron and start sprayin' like stars for her nigga
Bring me back another broad then menage with her nigga
One sucking my dick one sucking the balls on a nigga
They eat me like a shark and turn to Jaws on a nigga
Let me cum all on their faces Santa Claus for a nigga
And when I'm on the road she help withdrawals for a nigga
Snapchat she make it clap I mean applause for a nigga yeah
Bitch I got bars like a prison
These other rappers weak you better toss 'em the spinach
And I promise they can't see me they Ray Charles to a nigga
And I'm all about my commas like a pause in a sentence
So make sure it's 'bout money when you calling a nigga
I'm a dog on a mission, flow's so raw and efficient
I go hard I'm consistent ain't no fraudulent business
Even haters talkin' shit was all a part of my vision
I told bro get on your shit so we can all make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let my family starve in the trenches
No brakes I'm so driven I could cause a collision
If I kill you on sight, then I'm offing the witness
I'll be off in 60 seconds you get lost in a minute
So go ahead and dig a hole I'll put your coffin up in it
Niggas used to be my dogs now they all in they feelings
But it's FGE for life I'm taking off with the realest SQUAD!
