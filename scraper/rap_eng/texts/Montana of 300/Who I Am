[Chorus: Montana of 300 & (Jayln Sanders)]:
Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
Been in a couple jams, had to rearrange some plans
But it made me who I am (Yeah it made me who I am)
Yeah it made me who I am (Who I am, who I am)
Never asked for a hand
Didn't have too many friends
Tryna stay out that can
While I hustle for these bands
But it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah, it made me who I am

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]:
Yeah, straight from the ground like a push-up
I had to become a pusher
Like Master P, had the hook-up
A lot came with it but I never been shook up
Done been through it all
From jail, gettin' shot, almost dieing, but I knew to look up
God showed me the light through the cloud
The hate all around
But look what it took us
No daddy watchin' mama struggle too
Me hittin' them streets, had to hustle too
I'm feelin' like Meek, everything I use to be not what I was accustom to
And then came the beef, where we came with choppas Asserted like brothas do, they snitch in them streets
I promise 12 the only trouble we run into
Now we whippin' cases
So many thought we wouldn't make it
Even me sometimes I had to face it
We did it so quick like I was taken
But now I'm on my shit
All you hard readers can't get a cent
Aim so straight I can't miss
Be in my face, I don't know how to quit

[Chorus: Montana of 300 & (Jayln Sanders)]:

Yeah it made me who I am (Who I am, who I am)
Never asked for a hand
Didn't have too many friends
Tryna stay out that can
While I hustle for these bands
But it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah, it made me who I am

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
Flown way to the top, just like heaven gates
Knew with God on my side, I would never break
Just a young nigga, straight outta section 8
Project buildin', livin' around hella snakes
Mama buyin' from dealers that's sellin' weight
Still had sister, never put me second place
Shit wasn't never sweet
Just so I could eat
Sometimes she went days when she never ate
Done seen so much struggle, I'm comin' with it
Not ashamed of my pain, motha fuck a critic
Our refrigerator had nothin' in it
Told myself "then I gotta go fuckin' get it"
I remember days it was cold nigga
Our thermostat was the stove nigga
Way before the rappin' I was poor nigga
I was who was sleepin' on the floor nigga
Niggas seen niggas changed money made em' do it
I know the struggle well, I'm no stranger to it
Middle finger to it
I could make it through it
If there is a heaven, I ain't racin' to it
Had to sit drugs up on my scale
Dependent on clientele
Done took way to many L's
Sat in counties with no bail
Doin' push-ups in my cell
Time passin' like a snail
Never told, I'll never tell
Held that water like a pail
Got up every time I fell
Niggas tried me they got nailed
Trigger happy like Pharrell
Nina singin' like Adele
Got away with murder twice, hope I don't get sent to hell
Thankful I ain't in no grave or up in somebody's jail
All my niggas trust my vision, told em' hold on like a rail
I ain't never led us wrong, like I don't know how to spell
I get paid for every thought, like a fuckin' wishin' well
This is Fire in The Church, coldest thing to drop since hail

Yeah, it made me who I am (Who I am)
