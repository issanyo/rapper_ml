[Hook: No Fatigue]
FGE we eating
Get your own plate
Bitch I be with shooters
And their form great
I perform great, got all these women on me
Got million dollar DNA, bitch I was born great
(2x)

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Come alive in the night like I'm Dracula
When I hit the stage, I be acting up
Fuck whoever hatin' them straps with us
Put your whole team on ice, like a pack of puff
Or we could fight bitch, I pack a punch
You get bagged, you get tagged, you could pack your stuff
If you knew what I knew bitch, you rather run
I was born with that fire, the dragons son
FGE like a buffet
All type of flavor bitch, all type of taste
Everyone eating, we all got a plate
Sauce we just drip it, all over the place
Too bright for your light, yea I know why you hate
Bitches, we toss em up like a bouquet
Haters can catch it, like Beckham you play
Then I light your top up just like the new Wraith
See, I've been seeing dollar signs nigga
And what's on the heart of all of my niggas
No new brakes, I'm on the grind and go make home even if I gotta slide nigga
But bitch I ain't runnin' from nothing
And ain't up and running for nothing
Somebody tell Humpty I dump em
It won't be a fake when I pump em
Then shoot in they face like a jumper

[Hook: No Fatigue]
FGE we eating
Get your own plate
Bitch I be with shooters
And their form great
I perform great, got all these women on me
Got million dollar DNA, bitch I was born great

[Verse 2: Jalyn Sanders]
She want me to call like Barack I'm sharper, god damnit you should really know that
I'm riding to shoot and then kill, go after them bills in all black, no Kodak
Wet em up no poured on
Shoot em up Coach Carter
Now everybody in your city they claim that they knew you when you was important
But they didn't know you no, No
You probably should know that I ball, ball
Your bitch wanna fuck me on tour
She want me inside like d√©cor
Yeah, she see a nigga water all froze
So nigga want to do the fucking most
Hit the club
Turn it up
Bad models
Wanna fuck
Link up
Money longer no Uzi
Cartiers got a new face
Hermes belt got it new ways
Balenciaga just got a new pace
Like a new wave
Haters wanna ride a nigga new wave
See my vision clear like a Blu-ray
You can clear me real like a toupee
Bitch you know I know your whole crew fake

[Hook: No Fatigue]
FGE we eating
Get your own plate
Bitch I be with shooters
And their form great

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]
Haters know we eating
I made my own plate
Dropping crack like my iPhone ain't got no phone case
FGE got more cake
They're great, fuck you cornflakes
These labels can't afford me
My glory is the lords grace
These other rappers fourth place
I am uno, dos, tres
Rap God I'm so cold that I could make the devils soul shake
And even when I sold weight
I always had that on me
So if you shoot at me you bet' not miss me like a court date
I'm sliding on them pussies except I don't do no foreplay
That's killers up in your place
Pistols up in your face
Dressed in all black with two straps just like a pair of chrome 8s
I shoot like Robert Horry
I cook em like a gourmet

[Hook: No Fatigue]
FGE we eating
Get your own plate
Bitch I be with shooters
And their form great
I perform great, got all these women on me
Got million dollar DNA, bitch I was born great

No alert, I'm a baller
Perform great, yea I'm awesome

On every track I go the hardest
Shawty let me feel the Joseph peach no Keke, Ima palm her
Cut her good like a barber

Made my own plate, I'm that nigga
Eatin' good like a fat nigga
Was sleeping on me Snorlax nigga
Ain't no time to relax niggas
Shooters with me so don't try it
I'm bullet blowing like they sighing
He don't hit him like he drying
Then make room for the sirens
He steady blowing up her phone
Ima run his mane like a lion
Came out on water like a pirate
Back to that money, I'm the flyest

When they see me niggas always got the long face
But when I was broke man all you niggas was my homies
Bitch I did my own thing

You don't want no smoke bitch every line is dope its cocaine
Hang around these pussy niggas neck just like a gold chain
