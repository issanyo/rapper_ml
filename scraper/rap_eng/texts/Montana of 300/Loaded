[Verse 1: J Real]
I done told y'all niggas, now I gotta show y'all niggas
How I'm bout when I pose on niggas
Back in the day we done stole on niggas
Shorty got a forty and unload on niggas
Hop in the foreign and get ghost on niggas
Police interrogate, I don't know nothing nigga
Want beef with me, better smoke some nigga
I'm a shoot em with a shooter when I roll up nigga (yea)
These niggas is tweaking if they think this shit is a game
Fuck all of this fame, I'ma find out where you stay
Kick in the door to your place, put this gun to your face
And its over with after that
Bang Bang Bang

[Verse 2: No Fatigue]
Please don't get in my way with no interference
Don't get out yo body just like a spirit
Mac up to his chest, yea I'm bout to clear em
She go below like she bout to spear him
Slide in them DM's just like Yo Gotti
These hoes go fast just like Bugatti
Like a taste test these hoes wanna try me
I Stay in first so they can't go by me
Give me top, feel like a cap and gown
Don't fuck with niggas just like a Nazi
And i'm No Fatigue go follow my IG
Ben Franklin always somewhere that's by me
Watch I get big like The Great Khali
Young but I'm just great call me Ali
My flow is so cold, and it's not lowkey
I'm FGE and bitches know me

[Verse 3: Talley of 300]
No solution and I been a problem
Ever since [?] the lockers
Been a little nigga all of my life
But I will get big to Goliath
Juggin at 16 till they robbed him
That just turned me to a monster
But still I will go, even with no pole,[?]
I was airing shit out like a clothesline
Everyone walk on their toes now
[?], Then they get ghost
They know I keep trumpets and blow mine
But now my mind is a gold mine
I'm dropping hits right now writing no lines
I get 3k for the flow now
These bitches all on my pole now

[Verse 4: Don D]
Big guns
I ain't playing with nobody
Nigga cross the line put some holes in his body
All that tough talk you doing, you ain't scaring nobody
Got some niggas come and see you, and I put it on shotty
Hold on, now a nigga mad cuz he was sneak dissing
He was all in the grass, talking down bout the gas
Tryna finesse him out a bag, now you still on the block looking broke looking bad
You a pussy nigga, you ain't hitting no shit
Could bring the green gone and I'm still with the shits
Slide down on yo block everybody getting hit
[?] bullets, with the red hollow tips
Niggas call my phone like "Don what's the deal?"
You goofy ass nigga man it is what it is (FGE Shit Nigga)
It is what it is, you pussy ass nigga it is what it is

[Verse 5: $avage]
I ain't come to kill you, but any ill moves and that's what i will do
Cuz  niggas get wet up over the green, and left on the scene like some mildew
And yea I was trapping before I was rapping
I had them packs and I still do
And I got Glocks and you will get shot and put in a box like you kill moves
I'm ready If you niggas thinking you ready just say the word it's going down
Pussy try me get blown down
I was broke but I get dough now
So Tony told me keep the pole
I wasn't going in you know I can't go now
If he home we kick the door down
Get to blowing them niggas gone now

[Verse 6: Montana of 300]
I be flyer than a kite bitch
I be sharper than an ice pick
Put in work when it's dark out, me and nina like to work the night shift
Looking for them pussies like a dike bitch
30 shots sit in my clip
When I squeeze that tool like vice grip
Bullets get to flicking like a light switch
Now you niggas know it's not a game now
Had to show them niggas how that thing sound
Slid on him like James Brown, then i blew his motherfucking brains out
Its FGE bitch we fly you ain't, you watch me get paid
Boy that's why you ain't
Got gang with me up inside a tank, and I'm sucker free like inside a bank (Bow)
