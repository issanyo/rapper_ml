I thought you knew that I'm the man on me
Got all these bitches want dance on me
None of ‘em can’t wait to get their hands on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me
Keep the tooly keep some bands on me
I’m never lackin’ I be damned on me
Brand new Glock that bitch won’t jam on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
From the bottom of the bottom is where I came from
Fought fire with fire nigga I had a flamer
I turn my hell into heaven yup I done came up
Had to kick disloyal subjects up out of my kingdom
Whether they hate me or not they still bring my name up
But I only rock with the ones who ain’t never change up
It’s kind of funny when haters start smellin’ money
Everybody want to hop all aboard like here the train come
Remember whippin’ through the town on me
A couple thou’ forty cal on me
I put food in mouths servin’ pounds on me
And niggas hate I graduated cap and gown on me
A bunch of jewelry bunch of tats on me
That ass was fat she threw it back on me
Her nigga mad cuz I got racks on me
But boy I come like overalls you know the straps on me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
Forty on my hip again, thirty in my clip again
I feel like Diddy wit L.O.X. I’m about my Benjamin
Had to hustle in this concrete jungle we livin’ in
Been down before let the devil know I ain’t giving in
I put God first and he put me back on my shit again
These haters pissed again they throwing a fit again
But soon as I win again they back on my dick again
I’m making banks uncle Phil up in Vivian
No injury but lots of ice on me
Heard you wanna poke me like a knife on me
I hope you really bout that life on me
Cuz once I’m up you know I’m shootin’ like the dice on me
A bunch of haters wishing death on me
Don’t get a casket tryna flex on me
Cuz I’m a turn into to a ref on me
That tool eject up out this Tec that how he left on me

[Hook]
