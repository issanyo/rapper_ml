Every time I was up they was around
Everytime I was down, nowhere to be found
Now I'm up now, and yeah they stuck now
In they old ways I'm getting money while they hands out
Every time I was up they was around
Everytime I was down, nowhere to be found
Now I'm up now, and yeah they stuck now
In they old ways I'm getting money while they hands out


Verse 1 : $avage
Look
I was down and I was out but, never down for the count
All they every did was hate and all I did was make it out
Turned they back and they looked down so you won't see me turn around
Only come back for my niggas taking shots to make it count
Weigh it up and break it down
All my homies get a piece
Watch what's coming out your mouth and nigga practice what you preach
I was battling for cheap remember practicing for weeks
So I gotta praise the lord for every benefit I reap
Spit the truth and give the game to the shorty's like I teach
It's like they love you when you hungry and can't stand to see you eat
R.I.P to big bro
OG told me once you change roads like they paying tolls you the one they change on

Verse 2: No Fatigue

When I was up, like a orange, everyone was around
When I was down they disappeared no where to be found
No drake they showing fake love and fake smiles
Had to flip a couple packs to get up off the ground
Screaming free my nigga Billy since the 3rd grade
I woke up and seen the news that shit hurt me
They took my lil bro [?] that shit hurt me
I had to choose to make a way or go and make them pay, yeah
But you live and you learn
When I was down nobody gave no helping hands I had to stand firm
I got up like DMX and had to get it myself
I went through these loops in life like a belt
It never bailed up

Verse 3: Montana of 300

Practiced this rapping while trapping till I got cold at it
They broke, they mad, and they hating because I'm dough stacking
I've kicked doors, I've sold weed, I've sold ratchets
To see a difference I had to shake all them old habits
They just want to ball with you with hopes you give they ass assists
Attracted by flashy shit
Always there when cash exist
As soon as you fall off they'll disappear on you like magic tricks
They doubt that you gone bounce back when you do tell them, "don't ask for shit"
See when they see you eating, they reaching, want you to feed them
So down to ride when you see them but occupied when you need them
Old friends turn to haters they hate the way that I touch down
And those that stuck around shining with me
Thank God we up now
