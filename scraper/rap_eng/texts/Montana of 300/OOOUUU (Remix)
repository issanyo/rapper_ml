[Intro: Montana of 300]
Rap god, man, FGE shit, man. You already know what it is man
You already know why I'm here, man
I ain't like this fucking beat. Only doing this shit cause my fans asked me
In the studio, eating Halls and shit. Still sick with this shit

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
These haters on my dick piss em off
Take a pic with his bitch flick him off
These rappers trying to steal my swag get the sauce
They sold they soul for a loan niggas lost
I was lit like a new torch,streets was my new sport
Belt buckle double g's like two forks
Was drug dealing freakin balling like I'm Too $hort
Was serving niggas in the mall like a food court
Deuce 5 on me I was Derrick Rose in New York
Had to put some squares in a box like some Newport's
I grew older and my heart got colder
And my mind got stronger
And my money got longer
And them bitches got naked,and them people started hatin'
And my guns got bigger,so my flow got sicker
Let me tell you about this young cat,I always used to front packs
Was known for poking niggas for that paper like a thumbtack
I told them come rap, stop hangin with them dumb cats
It's free J Real until the day my nigga comeback
I used to pull up on the block with the bass banging
Big Strap hug a nigga like he waist training
I catch you clowns running around get your face painted
I put the chrome to his dome cause I hate aiming
10K for a show, you better hurry before the price change up
Rap god the light bringer,The life changer
I hope they pull it, 30 bullets in my banger
Versace shoes on looking like the white ranger
And these bitches not my problem they ain't stressing me
Bitch if you not my you bitch you can't question me
And shawty wanna blow my whistle she be beggin me
You call her Stephanie?, I call her referee
Shawty got that fire head that's a specialty
Head down between my legs OOOUUU pedigree
KP just called said he got another check for me
Like why you keep on sonning them I should get a vasectomy
Flow heavenly G.O.D. keep on blessing me
On my legacy
Saucing they want the recipe
I'm flyer then a Frisbee got all the bitches fetching me
And your bitch like my song she know every word like a spelling bee
Boy I swear we will be nothing breathing ahead of me
Came a long way from selling weed, wetting shit like the 7 seas
Stacking dough,and cracking hoes filling niggas with jealousy
Way before the felony's had these bitch niggas scared of me
I promise if you threaten me, When I see you you better be ready to back it up because I'm on your heels like i'm Beverly
Killing the infidelity,After U like the letter V
Gun smoking so much I think God might just be inhaling me
My swagger said,Might bag ya bitch
Go through walls like casper shit
Might sent her back after I hit,Then go home to the baddest bitch
Thats savage shit,I spaz and shit
Rap god to some I'm blasphemous
I've mastered this,They mad as shit
They can't stand me like Kapernick
I've passed the grace,Steve Nash assist
My wrist matches Michael Jackson's kicks
That 40 in my lap and shit,No poking me like cactus's
And no more moving packages
I'm stacking chips,my cash is thick
They broke as hell but paying tithes
Reason there pastor is rich
Pole inside my jumpsuit look like I be running track and shit
This 30 be my magic stick
I shoot like I'm T Mack with it
Catch an opp in traffic like Lebron you know I'm glassin' shit Don't joke and play,Just hope and pray one day I don't go back to this
Trunk fly in the front on some Dumbo shit
Bitch I'm flying until I die on my Nutso shit
Now run and tell all your friends how I went nuts on this
I'm cutthroat bitch,I promise I don't trust no bitch
And I ain't even gotta meet her I can fuck your bitch
Balling like Krillin bet I cut like a destructo disc
You play with mines I'm on your ass fuck all that humble shit
The greatest pussy never seen a killer come so quick
Clip out the window hanging longer then Rapunzel shit
It go BRAAAAAAATTT until my gun go click
Pussy's always in there feelings about something I said
Yelling "Gang, Gang, Gang" until one of them dead
You gotta brain better use it or get one in the head
I got killers like porn stars there gonna come for the bread
But I'm so independent with it I'm coming with it instead
I'll pop you up until you drop like you was jumping in bed
Go wash my hands after I leave the scene covered in red
Then kiss my momma on the head and tuck my sons into bed
Caught em lackin' up in traffic and got clean on em
Ease on em, let my trigger finger squeeze on em
Put that pressure on the nigga like it's weed on em
Smoked his ass,Hit the gas(VROOM), Speed on em

[Outro: Montana of 300]
Demons dressed as friends better watch them they envious
Don't Doubt The God album dropping May 20th
These haters on my dick piss, em off
They never..Whatchu' thought
FGE got it on lock, man of course
Hater's on my dick,piss em off
