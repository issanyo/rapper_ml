[Intro]
I feel like it's my, it's my uh, my responsibility to do that and to give you something good, you know. Whether they know it or not, you basically... you're a teacher. You got somebody's attention. And, you actually givin' them something. I'm finna give it to you. Every kind of way, you know, the good and the bad

[Verse]
Fire in my eyes, like when the stove blaze
I am the revenant, I done been through those cold days
Fighting demons, trying not to turn to my old ways
Like you lackin' traffic, I'm blasting ratchets, that's road rage
Ya'll using structures, you niggas ain't using logic
One shot in-between ya eyes, and you closing em like a closet
The afterlife isn't promised, only death, we can't dodge it
This life we live ain't forever, so make the most while you got it
Don't fry your brain with narcotics, see God is my only chronic
Your demons might bring you down, but he'll bring you up like hydraulics
I'm full of wisdom and knowledge, and sharin' it like a prophet
So love me all for my actions, not cuz of what's in my pockets
Just counted a thousand hunnids, my momma proud of her son
And she smilin' cuz now I'm buzzin'
Knew I would amount to something
She told me "all smiles ain't smiles, all grins ain't grins
Watch every nigga around you, all friends ain't friends
Don't be no fool, stay on your shit
All love ain't love, my son, all snakes don't hiss"
I got so much knowledge bottled up
Check up on me, no follow-ups
Teachin' all of my follower's
Till' they nail me like Yeshua
Look, don't sell your soul
Real nigga's don't ever fold
Just set and pursue your goals
The truth that was never told
Is they'll bribe you with cars and clothes
Shiny diamonds and gold
Performin' at hella shows
And after that, nailin' hoes
I've been grinding on my own
They can't bribe me with no loans
Before I live as a slave, I'll be dying on my throne
Don't do lying in my songs
Bitch, I'm flyer than the drones
Taking giants out they zones
Tell Goliath "bring it on!"
Rich thoughts while I'm living broke
Was sweeping, stumping, killing roaches on that kitchen floor
Sent to get eggs, but was stealing while was in the store
Went many winters with hoodies, didn't have no winter coat
Fuck that, start dealing dope
Got paper like an envelope
Was fuckin' paid, no gigolo
I swear I was so fresh that even Zest thought I invented soap
I ran into the fucking cops, fell off, had to kick a door
Lost lots of green like pigalo
I'm just thankful I'm still afloat
Remindin' God that I'm thankful, I always tell him that
While hoping the people we've lost is wherever heaven's at
And I know what that struggle like, robbin', stealin', sellin' packs
When this christmas come, your kids don't wonder where they presents at
The bar's been set, go be better than those that came before you
Flex like bodybuilders, and shine on nigga's like baby oil
But try not to slip cuz the prison system got places for you
Don't get the picture, my nigga, here let me paint it for you
The same nigga's that say they love you and claim they loyal
Ain't gon' pay no lawyers or let alone, raise your babies for you
It don't make you real cuz there's diamonds inside your damn watch
And never left your hood, and you always reppin' your damn block
And It don't make you savage cuz you be totin' no damn Glocks
Or popped it at no opps, so you ran away from no damn cops
Or sold a bunch of grams, or be standin' over them damn pots
Or you stay in the field, like them lil nigga's off Sandlot
If you don't want your momma to see you up in no damn box
Just aim straight, for that ain't cool, like Ken Shamrock
Used to watch Rap City, had dreams to be at the damn top
Now labels on my dick, with hopes they can get my John Hancock
Nobody famous reached out to me, or gave me no damn shot
Lately I'm adding dough to my knots, until rubberbands pop
I caught a couple gun cases that still steel with him
My fans love when I'm going in for the kill, nigga
Like hopin' out whips with them pumps if I'm on your heels, nigga
You better heal, nigga, I'm just here to heal nigga's
Give em the real, you may never know how that feels, nigga
I don't complain or chill, I got too much will, nigga
Made it this far, and I did it without a deal, nigga
Just cuz you got a dead homie don't make you real, nigga
Every man dies, but not every man lives
And I'm thankful for my banks, like I married aunt Viv'
But I'm wonderin', why is hell still a punishment?
If they say Jesus died on that cross for, every man's sins
Nobody's safe, nobody's pure, nobody's sure
Your spots a maybe, you're crazy, no spots secure
Put God first, I don't make a move unless he's involved
Fightin' demons off while I'm droppin' jewels like I've seen it all

[Outro]
And you need to understand that and give them something, you know, give them something good, give them something they can use. You know, here and there. Instead of giving them all this, uh, bullshit, that they want, that the majority of people want, you know
