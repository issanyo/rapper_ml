[Hook]
Went from trappin' with my bro's, sellin' O's off pounds of dro
Drivin' on the road, we was gettin' it for the low
Now I see lots of moolah off these features and these shows
I got bands, I got dough, but I don't trick off with these hoes
Went from trappin' with my bro's, sellin' O's off pounds of dro
Drivin' on the road, we was gettin' it for the low
Now I see lots of moolah off these features and these shows
I got bands, I got dough, but I don't trick off with these hoes

[Verse 1]
Pockets on swole, while I'm strapped up with that pole
That is how I roll, every time I hit the road
In and out of town, we was juggin' off them pounds
Couldn't wait to break it down, and turn 10K to 20 thou
I'm the shit, haters pissed, ah, rap God in this bitch
I'm on top, haters watch, I know hella nigga's sick
Ain't no doubt, I got clout, been had bitches on my dick
Fuckin' thotties, catchin' bodies, I was really with the shits
I let your boo slide in my whip, she put my tool in her lips
And I promise I don't smoke, but I'm gettin' blew behind the tent
When I cut, she think she dreamin', Freddy Krueger in this bitch
I do got chips, but these hoes don't get no moolah from a pimp

Went from trappin' with my bro's, sellin' O's off pounds of dro

[Verse 2]
Way before this rap, I was gettin' it out the trap
Pushin' packs and buyin' straps, play with my money and get whacked
I spit facts, I don't act, bitch I've been about my dough
They used to ask how much my dro
Now it's "how much you charge a show?"
Times was hard, had no job, I was gettin' it out the mud
Hit my plug, pray to God I don't get caught with the bud
I was doin' it for my squad, I was doin' it for my blood
Tryna bubble like some suds, me, my pistol and the drugs
I'm Steph Curry with the Glock and if I lurk you gon' get popped
Had to murk a couple opps while I was workin' to the top
These bitches thirsty cause I'm hot, won't fill your purse up with no guap
Bitch you ain't work for what I got, and you ain't make these verses hot
