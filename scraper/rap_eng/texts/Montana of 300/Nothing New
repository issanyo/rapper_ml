[Hook]
Stackin' up that loot
This ain't nothin' new
These bitches wanna choose
This ain't nothin' new
Fuck niggas hate the crew
This ain't nothin' new
Run up on 'em and shoot
This ain't nothin' new
Ay

This ain't nothin' new
These bitches wanna choose
This ain't nothin' new
Fuck niggas hate the crew
This ain't nothin' new
Run up on 'em and shoot

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
I get money and bitches so I'm riding lowkey
Case I get in a jam I'm never riding on it, keep that fire on me
Now run while you can
Bitches gon' know the squad, we going hard
Swearing they love it
Well hope they bout money like giving it to me
And when it come to bread I like cuttin'
See I keep it pimpin' you hear me?
These bitches gon' choose, gon' do what they do
But I'm bout that business my nigga
I'm making these moves I'm paying these dues
While these fuck niggas sneakdiss then them shells hit 'em
And whoever dwell with 'em
They out on display, the truth is they all wanna hate I send 'em to hell with 'em
Anyway bitch FGE on the rise
These streets won't deny
Thank God for my hittas, shout out to my squad
They with me til' I die
See we just 'bout gettin' and gettin' and hustlin' and stackin'
Never know what can happen we pimpin', we mackin'
We see how these bitches be acting, these haters can't stand no reaction
But that's what it do when you been fly bitch we flew-ish
Straight to that money don't know what you doing but the haters amusing
See you looking flagrant but don't do it
My billions let's move it
Man why you strapped up I'ma shoot you up like you was using and back to that loot bitch
This ain't nothin' new

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
Been the best out my city
Bitch I been on my grizzy
All the hoes wanna pick me
They wanna get busy
I know they can't roll if they iffy
I fuck and get sucked like a hickey
I hope God forgive me for putting a body on my semi
Lord knows I ain't right like I'm Drizzy
So fuck nigga miss me
Montana ain't shy with that Glizzy
Then lay niggas down that done diss me
Don't think I'm too busy
Get your ass shot like Nicki
Been riding around with big poppers like Diddy
And it spit faster than Bizzy
I slide then I bust then be gone in a jiffy
Bitches we call that a quickie
Try to run if you want Imma do 'em like Ricky
Put one in his back like he Penny
Get turned to a pack of that sticky
You know I'm the man
I'll turn your bitch to a fan
You know that I can
I stay fly I won't land
450 for my pants
Just to stuff 'em with bands
Got dough like a buscuit came out of that can
Then I got straight to them grams
Don't got no time for playin'
Heat on me like a tan
So fuck is you sayin'?
I'm gon' blow like a fan
Load this bitch then go blam
And that's on my soul
If the opps wanna roll
You get popped like a Xan
Leave you right where you stand
I'm the truth
I flex like Rick Rude
I keep that pistol on me, glued
I stay with that tool
Shit ain't new

[Outro}
Stackin' up that loot
This ain't nothin' new
These bitches wanna choose
This ain't nothin' new
Fuck niggas hate the crew
This ain't nothin' new
Run up on 'em and shoot
This ain't nothin' new
