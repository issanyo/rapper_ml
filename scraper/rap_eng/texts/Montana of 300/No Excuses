Put a price on ya head yeah, ya life will get fuckin bought
And I don't mean good sex, when I let nina fuck you up

No fatigue, no pause, no pain, no gain, no heart
Know the game, know the ball, know the streets, know the bitches, know the law
Watch ya bitch cuz I'll hit her pull a hamstring know ya broad
Niggas always hating on me they just really wanna feel so involved
Until I'm riding in the cut
9 when it tucked I leave em red mmm fire in a truck
I be gassing up i be riding higher than a bus
These hoes out blowing but i ain't hit em up
Imma give her dick break her back had to sit her up
Niggas out here in they feelings they be giving up
If you waking up another day you better give it up
I be tryna chase a bag i be tryna live it up
Fuck with fam then somebody dying
I'm a man with no heart with that iron
Rollin metal like optimus prime
Now the game its gone be a true crime
And i took the wrist and timed the watch
While you sleeping at them hiding spots
Niggas think they funny red fox
Like a kids meal he getting boxed
