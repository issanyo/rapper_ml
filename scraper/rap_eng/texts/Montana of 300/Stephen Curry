[Hook: Montana of 300]
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry

[Verse 1: J Real]
Don't come around my block nigga
Knowing damn well we don't rock wit ya
30's off in these Glocks nigga
Squeeze that bitch it don't stop nigga
Imma ? nigga, I pop niggas
If he riding with ya, he gon die with ya
Pull up right beside niggas
And let the whole clip ride nigga
Blowing shit, I go broke in shit
Then I'm poking shit doors get kicked
223 with a 50 clip
It take two hands to even hold the bitch
Fuck niggas I can't trust them
Did once and I learned my lesson
Crossed the nigga like an intersection
Had to pick his ass like an interception
Hit his ass with that Smith & Wesson
Murder shit, I think I got a fetish
When I shoot that gun and I see that blood
Everybody dead so ain't nobody tellin'
They like there he go, yeah here I am
Not to long ago, I was in the can
Now I'm fly as peter pan
And these bitches wanna kick it like Jackie Chan
FGE bitch we the clan
?
Your bitch blue like a pepsi can
And I'm a pimp nigga, I ain't never payin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Real]
Don't know a misdemeanor only class X
30 shots when I blast tecs
Hop up outta that Aztec
Counting bodies like I'm Mad Max
I'm in the Windy City brought some killers with me
Bitches fuckin for a fifth of ?
That's why I can never love a ho
Kick her out before she get comfortable
I'm J Real I won't lack, opps know that I'm on that
Meet a nigga at his doormat
Run up on him let the pole clap
Momma told me mutha fuckers phony
Don't trust a nigga, far as you can throw him
Fuck the feds they trying to slam my bro
These niggas hating on me, I don't even know em'
Fuck I need to come back for
Got mine hope you got yours
40 Cal that's my boy
Send a nigga to the top floor
Like boom bitch nigga take this
Remember jackie and I had to hold a clip
But the motha fuckers still ? spit
So I ain't give a fuck, I was drilling bitch
