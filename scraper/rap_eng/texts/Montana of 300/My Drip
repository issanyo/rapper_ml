Check out my drip
Im saucing on  (?)
Check out my wrist
Look at my neck and my ears
See haters know they can't afford this
All Eyes On Me 2Pac Shakurish
And give my all but i want your bitch
Can't wait till i get up touring
(2x)

{Verse 1: Montana of 300}
She just text messaged me now
Daddy when she be addressing me now
She horny she wish she was next to me now
And telling me how she be f'ing me now
Shawty like a spy
She be all on my IG
She just like a cashier she be checking me out
On point like a javelin
Call when im traveling
She want to blow like a referee now
Might drip on your main bitch
Im fly as Liu Kang kicks
My name in their mouth cause im sharper than fangs bitch
I dont wet no plain shit
Can't fuck on no plain bitch
Top while i lane switch
Ghost Rider my chain lit
Put ice on my wrist that bitch look like i sprained it
Killers i hang with
Options to leave whoever you came with

{Verse 2: Montana of 300)
Your bitch want to do me
Im tatted like Tunchei
My socks FGE bitch my flip flops is Gucci
Got more kicks than Bruce Lee
I slide right up out them then slide in that coochie
Just like a jacuzzi
His chick is a dime and im martin on blue streak
Saucing and groovy
Gave me that box i deliver like Mookie
Ball like a (?) then go sauce on a bitch
Get green on me i got that bag like the Grinch
Diamonds on my wrist and they flick like a switch
She gon' throw soon as i come back like a hitch
Before i go do in she do down like a ditch
And suck like a tick her tongue longer than Kiss
After the top she gon' climb like a fence ride this wood like a witch and then go nuts like a wrench
