We done came up on our own
All my niggas on
Got a wifey at the crib, Imma play her on the low
(?)
I been blowing hella cones
We done came up from nothin now I finally feel at home
Ain't too many niggas, that's gon' ride with they niggas
And go get it when they get it then they split it 50/50, uh
Momma never worried, shoot, she never gotta ask
Cause her son signin niggas , trendy topic, that's a fact
But they stay on the line
Jewels automatic shine
Bro want a free feature, but money is time
Say they know me now they lyin
Shoot, we was never close
Old dude was a snake and old girl was a hoe
Back up don't run up
Can't tell, but Domo got it tucked
You niggas don't know us, as much as you think you're one of us
First get yo flow up
Then click up and roll up
Then y'all get yo dough up
Play your role, on your own

[HOOK]: Innocent
Real niggas come up on the low
You wait for moves, we gettin dough
The only thing that I have for you is this L
All I hear is "bro, cuz", how these niggas know us?
I'm so on that I just might turn down a deal [X2]

[Verse 2]: Montana Of 300
UH HUHHH
Rap God, every song cold
I'm a hunnid nigga like a old soul
Tony Montana, with the coke nose
I don't feel a thing so I won't fold
This the wordsmith, standin firm bitch
Turnin down deals, what I'm known for
Could've been rich but I ain't dumb
Took the small route that's a long road
Gettin dough, chauffeur
Big chips, I could poke her (poker)
Want them big checks, gotta invest, put yo bread in like a toaster
Went from sellin weight, now we celebratin
Drinks on me like a coaster
And I ain't worried homie cause this 30 on me keep me real warm like my coat fur
I'm lit bitch, I'm up hoe
I am on nigga like a light switch
Known for having bars and killin niggas
I am sharp nigga like an ice pick
I was in the field like Mike Vick, squeezin hella tools, no vicegrip
Kept a big strap for them pussy niggas that be actin hard like a dyke bitch
When I'm takin off, broski flyin wit me
When I'm navigatin, know that iron wit me
Always buyin Glizzys, come and try it wit me
Bitches wet, I'm wavy, like Poseidon wit me
Everybody witness how I'm bodyin this
Came up on my own they wonder "how he did it?"
Ain't no flashin money, I be stashin money, and plus how much I make ain't everybody business
SQUAD
