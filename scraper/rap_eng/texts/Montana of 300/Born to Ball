I was born to ball
Ima stack that money tall
After i get mine ima share it with my dawgs
Got to carry out the plans cause you only get one chance
Yeah i do this for my fam
Haters hate the way i ball
I was born to ball
Ima stack that money tall
After i get mine ima share it with my dawgs
Got to carry out the plans cause you only get one chance
Watch them haters turn to fans
They gone love the way i ball

{Verse 1}
They like the way im ballin they want to see a replay
Ima run it back i got more cuts than any DJ
Spin moves like DJ
Blowing cake no B-Day
Ive been that dude since Pre-K
Im in the game like EA
More drive than a freeway
Im focused i can see straight
My homies on the same track
But this ain't no relay
Every time we march you April fools dont want to see May
And shout out to my coach yeah
I only do what he say
And i bet i make my mama proud
My greatness make my mama smile
I came this far no stopping now
My defense tight i lock them down

Cause i snap like a crocodile
I got it cracking Bobby Brown
Im sonning yall no problem child
