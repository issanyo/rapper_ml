Chorus (Montana of 300):

Watch out bitch I'm coming through
Strapped up I will punish you
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah I'm that fucking dude
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Haters hate that's nothing new
I'm always in something new
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm thumbin' through
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Ooh aah Bitch I'm that fucking dude

Verse (Montana of 300):

I've been that dude since preschool
Gotta keep the heat glued
Just bought a new crib and I got pistols up in each room
And they can't wait to break your ass down like a weak stool
I dare these cats to speak rude
Get boxed up like Chinese food
If you niggas deep I'm switching clips faster then previews
Niggas think they sharks but to my chopper they just seafood
Sometimes you gotta teach fools
Practice what you preach to 'em
Than bag his bitch like sugar
Watch me scoop her like a teaspoon
I cut her like a deep wound
These hoes on my dick now
My Gucci coat cost 6 thou
My son asked are we rich now
I spit like my tooth crack
Your money short go loop back
You softer than a fruit snack
You loud until I mute that
We under where your roof at
Steve Urkel I'm too strapped
And everybody with me got text like a group chat
Put that pussy in the freezer I'm about to do that
Have everybody who knew you
Talk about he was a cool cat

Chorus (Montana of 300):

Watch out bitch I'm coming through
Strapped up I will punish you
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah I'm that fucking dude
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Haters hate that's nothing new
I'm always in something new
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Ooh aah Bitch I'm that fucking dude

Verse ($avage):

Gucci to my fucking shoes
Flyest nigga in the room
Bitch it's $avage
No this ain't no 21 or 22
Big ass .40 on me
No this not no fucking .22
Put a nigga on the news
Than I take off to the moon
Stephen Curry with that 30
I'm a fool with that tool
Leave the cops without a clue
Leave a opp without his (trues?)
Pull up on that nigga
Blow him down like the hottest soup
These bitches know I got the juice
FGE my squad solute

Chorus (Montana of 300):

Watch out bitch I'm coming through
Strapped up I will punish you
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah I'm that fucking dude
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Haters hate that's nothing new
I'm always in something new
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm thumbin' through
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Ooh aah Bitch I'm that fucking dude

Verse (No Fatigue):

Watch out bitch I'm coming through
Hating that's what suckers do
I update when somethings new
Bosses don't tell what they do
They just make them fucking moves
Know I who the fuck is you
Don't taken L's just W's
No way I can fucking lose
Everybody know I'm like abc's
Young nigga fly not DC
And your bitch watch me on her PC
Cause I'm shitting on them like VC
All I want is back like double A's
Both hands on em now I'm doubling
Like blue faces I don't fuck with green
Don't trust bitches, hoes billy jean
I bought up my shades and my chains
Watch haters [?] what I gain
On heat with a mask like I'm Kane
Put this on your forehead no Bang
Got the round my waste no plane
You can get smoked like Jane
When I up em aiming for the brain
I"m a change a nigga no lane
Ooh aah
Count big faces everyday
Ooh aah
You know I had to make a way
Ooh aah
I'm flexing on em, Luke Cage
Ooh aah
I think I'm stuck up in my ways

Chorus (Montana of 300):

Watch out bitch I'm coming through
Strapped up I will punish you
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah I'm that fucking dude
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Haters hate that's nothing new
I'm always in something new
$1600 for the shoes
Big faces I'm coming through
Ooh aah who the fuck is you?
Ooh aah Bitch I'm that fucking dude
