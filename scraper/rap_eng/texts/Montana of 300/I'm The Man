[Hook]
Ever since a youngin
I knew I'd be the man
Jumped off the porch I start hustlin
Made my way to them bands
Yeah I turned nothing to something
Cuz I stuck to the plan
I got my fam out that jam
Thats how I became the man

Im the man, Im the man, Im the man yes I am
Im the man, Im the man, I got bands in my pants
Im the man, Im the man, I got fans in the stands
Im the man, Im the man, Im the man
Yes I am

[Verse 1]
I was gang
Bangin like a judge
Bitch I was the plug
Movin drugs, holdin like a grudge
Thumbin like a smudge
Used to count, money on the couch
Fish scale like a trout
Hit the road, If we saw a drought
Odell with the route
Half a zip to a pound
Yes I was pushin them packs
Like chicken pox I got scratch
Used to get cheese out the trap
Now I get paid for these tracks
Put FGE on my back
My gucci bag filled with racks
Armed with that steel like im Jax
And If its jail that you talk
My 40 blow like a sax
Just blew a bag up in Saks
Yo main bitch want me thats facts
You know she will let me cut
Because im sharp as an axe
Might crack yo chick like she hatched
I hope she dont get attached
Im talkin way before the buzz honey
I was gettin drug money
Known for comin round here ballin
Breaded like a hush puppy
Had hoes sellin drugs for me
Some was holding doors for me
Diving in them hoes-WOO! Sauce
Like im bugs bunny

Im the man, Im the man, Im the man yes I am
Im the man, Im the man, I got bands in my pants
Im the man, Im the man, I got fans in the stands
Im the man, Im the man, Im the man
Yes I am

[Verse 2]
Always move with a purpose
I hustled cuz I had to
Sellin dope like its hope
While I collect like the pastor
I was gettin to the dough no matter what
You'd think I pick locks
In the liquor store just bought some baggies in some zip locks
Trappin everyday til it got hot
And then we switched spots
Like nino got shit crackin
Had em actin like they chris rock
Coppin from this rapper
Not like 2Pac off of Gridlock'd
Fly nigga no hitchcock
Twenty on my wrist watch
Riding with that big Glock
Stunting while the kids watch
And they all ran up to me
When I pulled up like a pit stop
Rap god all my raps is clever
And I'm stacking cheddar
Told my squad, we should rap together
We can't trap forever
Still on fire
Sharp as master shredder
Thats why cats got jealous
If you try
You'll get whacked, get wet up
With this black beretta
Niggas died and no more moving packs
I thank god I'm through with that
Had clients running through the trap
But now all I do is rap

Ever since a youngin

Im the man, Im the man, Im the man yes I am
Im the man, Im the man, I got bands in my pants
Im the man, Im the man, I got fans in the stands
Im the man, Im the man, Im the man
Yes I am
