[Hook]
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
'bout to pop like rubber bands
Have them bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go niggas know I keep the pole
Heater on me like I'm cold
Light your top up like a stove
Broski roll with me before
Therefore he know how it go
If these opps ain't out on the block
Then we hopping out kicking doors
I just bought a K nigga I just bought a pump
And they right here in this van we ain't gotta pop the trunk
See, he thought it was safe, he thought all I did was rap
Till I showed up with them straps then I turnt up to the max yeah
I be getting paid nigga I be getting guap
I tell bronem get the dough like I heard somebody knock
Niggas hate me and my mans because we be getting bands
40 in my pants, tell the opps it's time to dance
Boy don't make me come and find y'all
I be letting the iron off
Head shots when I'm firin' off
Your brains on the sidewalk
And right after I pop 'em I swear I forget about 'em
Niggas claim the with the shits until I shoot the shit up out 'em yeah

[Hook]
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
Bout to pop like rubber bands
I bet bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck

[Verse 2]
Bitch I think I'm Nino mixed with Al Pacino
Stacking chips like Pringles
I ball like Ochocinco
Ice man Dean Malenko
My wrist look like sprinkles
Iron in my pants like I'm getting out the wrinkles
Take a nigga out and I ain't talking 'bout a date
Cook a nigga like a steak and fix his niggas like a plate
Like a pepsi you get popped
Send your ass to heaven's gates
Got the police on your block
Decorate with yellow tape
(Go to church)
Okay fuckboy you softer than Nerf
I'm lurking all through your turf
When I pop at you I turn families blue
I'mma pop a nigga no smurf
These niggas clowns and Imma kill a clown so jokers don't post up
Been no joke, I don't smoke but Imma burn hard when I roll up
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't give a fuck who see me
That semi pop and start sending shots
I'll put you in a box like Houdini
Get smoked like loud packs when I pull up where your house at
Y'all bitch niggas, Y'all fugazi
My crew crazy we bounce back

[Hook]
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
Bout to pop like rubber bands
I bet bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
