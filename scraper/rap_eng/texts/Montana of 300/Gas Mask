[Verse 1: Talley of 300]

Shit I'm too much
Too much for my damn self
Hit the streets and go hand in hand I place that paper like damn stamps
Try, bitch Imma teach you 'bout drumming, and blowing trumpets that's band camp
I'm only coming to tell you sweet dreams, bitch I'm the Sandman
Take every shot at his top like he wearing a head cam, yeah he a dead man
If he survive then I swear it's a miracle, but he gon' need a bedpan
Leavin' 'em pissed, let's go take his life and don't leave him with shit
Watchu know 'bout blowing the Reaper a kiss, I promise six feet ain't the deepest it get
That's why I keep God, pray and play smart, keep the DA and my face with a charge
Keep tools on me in the street like martial law, and fuck the police I'm on national guard
If we ain't in business then you ain't the fam
Then you don't eat, Ethiopian
Fuck with the team, yeah he hope he can
So he suicide like the Holy Quran
Yo bitch I ain't meet, that ho in a trance
Better get a leash before she go off command
If we in the sheets then she gon' know the clan
And I keep it up front so she know where I stand
TO3 if you ain't know who I am
Heat on me bitch I'm gon' blow like a fan
GOD with me and so are these bands
FGE in and we so in demand
Yeah
Coming from the sole like old boots
Nigga Imma vet like old troops
This shit is accustomed like a old school
And you niggas just old news
Do it all, go hard like I don't bruise
I stay on alarm, bitch I won't snooze
Repairman yeah bitch I know tools
Get in these muddy waters you gon' know blues
No trust for these niggas, they could be the po-lice
Gotta watch for the Snake Eyes, without rolling no dice
They hate when you gettin' and pimpin'
And bitch I'm so dynamite, but I'm known to leave a bitch froze
(boom, boom)
Disney on Ice

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]

I'm a killer in a gas mask
I was headed up a bad path
Infatuated with the fast cash
Pounds no hashtag
Brought 'em in a trash bag
Got the weight off like lipo
Don't ever play around with my dough
The last nigga that you beefed with didn't make you full of steel but this one wheel (will) unicycle
Smooth criminal, Michael
I'm so focused like a tight rope
FGE that's what I ride for
Started moving hydro, now I'm going viral
Everything I spit is pyro
Watch me kick it like Tae Bo [?]
Youngin from the ninth floor, nice flow
Verses so deep that you gotta translate 'em like the Bible
Breakin' rules with my dudes up in school with them tools but I didn't go to Columbine
I got so much money on my mafucking mind that I tattooed a dollar sign
I'm self-made I'm self-paid that's the bottom line
I'm just fine I ain't signing no dotted line
Talk shit and see me, or just keep your mouth closed, who knows you might just live to see father time
When you beefing with me in these streets boy I know exactly what to do with ya
It's B.O.B.E when we suiting up
This murder shit ain't nothing new to us
I never call my shootas up
They call me like "Yo, you want me to shoot him up?"
Ha!
The looks on they face is so priceless when they come to realize it's two of us
Like Jesus get nailed to the cross when it's MC Hammer, I ain't come here to screw with ya
Get nailed with these shells when this ruger up
I gave 'em hell just like God did to Lucifer
Your son or your daughter, your mami, your papi, your granny I don't give a fuck who with ya
See first I whack you then slide dick in your boo
She get passed on to my crew then I'm through with her
I got head in the whip, spread the legs on that chick, yup I beat that pussy no drumstick
Two pussies in one night that's fun shit
I let that bitch off til' my gun click
Right between his eyes then they closed up
Yo nigga got whacked then you froze up
No strip club but bitch I stay poled up
Like Lamborghini doors, my dough's up
