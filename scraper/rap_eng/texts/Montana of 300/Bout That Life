Money and murder

Money and murder

You ain’t about that life, fuck nigga you about to die

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tally of 300]
Okay bitch I’m rollin’ pistol totin’ got that 40

Empty it to reload it, gasoline let’s explode it
Ain’t no turning back once this killa shit control me
Money and murder, fuck you know bout it?
When we come get it, don’t be violent cuz you be silent
Cuz we be wildin’ then get back to the cash cuz bitch we bout it
Phone hit all day, Glock on me broad day
In a white tee, Nikes don’t worry bout why I ain’t icy
Just know that I gotta pocket full of money yall dummies
And the shit yall niggas talkin’ don’t excite me
Money and murder get to it don’t talk bout it just do it for the day you cross a nigga like me (bang-bang)
