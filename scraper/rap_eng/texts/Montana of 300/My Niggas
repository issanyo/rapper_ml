[Hook: Montana of 300]
Women, we swimming, my niggas, we winning
Got thirties, and .40s, my niggas, stay with them
The windows, they tinted, my niggas, they in them
I send them, they sinning, put work in, like Minions
[X2]

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Don't get caught in this onslaught, locate ya like OnStar
Fuck both of you and leave the scene wet, and I ain't no porn star
No padded room but I'm strapped up, not Jason but I'm masked up (uh-uh)
And that chopper with me, just make sure I don't catch up or get blessed up
Leave you holier than the Pope, nigga, hang your ass like a coat nigga
You no different frm a transsexual, it ain't hard to tell you're a hoe nigga
And you don't want war, nigga, your mama might have to go, nigga
Auntie, grandma, but that's mandatory for your bro, nigga
Let Pinocchio hit ya
Rush ya like bull it's gon get ya
Better not have your hoe with ya, or she gone do-si-do with ya
They hold hands, that's spinning, from two Glocks
I'm twinning, that's 187, yeah there's been a killing
Better pray about it, (uh-uh) hope God find you a way up out it, nigga
Before you drip like baby bottles, (uh-uh) dust your ass like baby powder, nigga
Ain't no way around it, you gon' get soaked like paper towels, nigga
Steam roll how I'm laying down a nigga, that's flat, that's that (bang)

[Verse 2: $avage]
FGE, 300, my niggas, we run it
I'm coming, from nothing, you see me, I'm stunting
You like it, I love it, we shooting, in public
I look like, a stuntman, heads up, I'm dumping (boom! x10)
Pussy nigga tried to play me, but it's not a movie
Don't be foolish, bump into us, better watch your movements
Cause it ain't shit to call my killas like it's time to do it
Red and green beams on 'em like he rockin' Gucci
Young nigga getting paper, raised by pimps and players
50s with the lasers, bought 'em for a fuckin hater
Icy charm around my neck look like the Himalayas
Diamonds fighting in the ring look like the Undertaker
Chain swinging, diamonds bite like a Mike Tyson fight
Birds in the trap sing like Brian McKnight
Dollar sign in my name like I'm Travis $cott
Blast a Glock, smash a thot, and get back to the guap

[Hook]
Women, we swimming, my niggas, we winning

[Verse 3: Don D]
Bro called me like "the pounds late," run shooters up we on the Interstate
All black whip with the tinted windows, can't see up in 'em with [?]
Niggas be talking 'til I get up on 'em, and now they even ain't got nothing to say
And yeah, I got a Dominican bitch, I just fuck her good, then she give us Ks
Niggas be talking that 'round me, but got bangers on stage and in the crowd, nigga
[?] 30 down nigga, yeah [?] our folks just bought a 100 rounds nigga
And I swear any nigga can get it
All blacked up when I'm on that mission
Money on his head, then I'm getting that ticket
Pop up where he lay, found out where he kick it, yup
My nigga, we with that, you run off, get kidnapped
Got thirties, and .40s, with extendos, they kick back
I'm on your ass boy, yeah I'm on your ass boy
If I find out, then I'm riding out, my niggas ain't even gotta ask boy (can I get that address)
You [?], you ain't rough, you act hard, you play tough
You bamboozled, you laid up, she treat you, I pay her
I'm like nah nigga, (bang bang bang bang)
You pussy ass niggas shouldn't have crossed my mans

Women, we swimming, my niggas, we winning
