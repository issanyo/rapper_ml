This right here that real rap
This beat I'mma kill that
My pockets uncle Phil fat

Yehhhh it's Montana yeh I'm the one your bitch like
I'm your bitch type nigga you that bitch type
You wanna go to war you must hate your life life
And all that money don't mean shit If I come take your life
New world harder i wear heat like the slodder
Got gunz inside of your daugther don't fuck around or get slaughtered
You niggas say you want beefing i got that murda shit for ya
Caught 2 gun cases last year in got christmas all with my lawyerr
Bitch I ball like a Hoya
Go get brain from LaToya
Then go slide dick in her sister
I cut that bitch like a butcher
All of my niggas is pushers
We fucking paid like a hooker
You wanna play with a gangster
You better be Ashton Kutcher
This is more than that rappin
This is how this shit happened
Round of applause with them choppers
Me and my partners be clappin
All of my niggas is eating
Like Tally pass me a napkin
I swear this niggas ise acting; Samual Jackson
I can like stay bout that action
I turn that ass to a fraction
If niggas asking I'm whacking
It ain't no day that I'm lackin
So everyday bitch I'm packin
While i hussle and sackin
That ratchets under my jackets for niggas thinking about jacking
I just up with them popping cop this the day that I'm coppin
Real nigga shit try to knock it that bitch blast off like a rocket
And bitch i promise i don't play with ya we are not the same nigga
You ain't in my lane nigga i've never been no lame nigga
No this is not a game nigga i come there where you stay nigga
Like knock knock who's there it's mister let that 40 bang nigga
Blow out your fucking brains nigga message to those who hang with ya

Got plans around the ocean
Yo cuz some shit just ain't for
But nigga you dont wanna see me  come out that whip like a genie
Spray your ass like graffiti  and put that on my next CD
My calico be loaded Lux so nigga you gon' get this work

Put his ass in the dirt and now this fag on a shirt
That's no joke, he got smoked, like a bag of that purp
Its FGE and HF they know im flyer than em
You can think you sweet if you want it you can come and try it nigga
You're not a rider them Pradas don't come with tires nigga

Im Freddy Krueger mixed up with some Micheal Myers nigga
Jeepers creepers and Jason yes im the flyest killer
And I can back up all this shit that I talk
Boy I've been fly for so long I forgot what it feels like to walk
And I got super swag, I bet you hate mine
Your girl all on my dick uh huh she wanna taste mine
I get my Gucci belt, that bitch ain't gon' waste time
Im on my iphone getting head; facetime
Im at the side I ain't gotta let the nine pop
Murder up put the beat in a pine box
And as long as im living ima keep killing shit when I spit so never will crime stop
They say im hot when im colder than a bomb pop
Watch froze you would think I made time stop
Chain swinging like its playing for white socks
Come with the strap like a fresh pair of hot tops
Whip fly like im sitting in the skybox
Got eyes wide open like an eyedrop
See im over you niggas like a eye dock
You niggas couldn't be fly if she sky dropped
Watch your chick cause the bitches on my cock
Better keep an eye on it like a cyclops
Cause if you dont then she coming back to my spot
And ima fuck her like you never could why not
A bitch nigga thats the shit I dont like
A bunch of pussies acting hard thats what we call dykes
Your bitch on the phone like: this nigga can't bone right
Come get me that long pipe and i'll be in my zone like
Cause bitch I ball like, the one they call mike
30 shots I let them bitches loose like a dog fight
My bars cold, nigga Klondike
No paper no pen nigga I don't write
