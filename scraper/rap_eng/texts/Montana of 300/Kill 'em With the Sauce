[Intro]
Ayy DeCicco, what up my nigga?

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill ’em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill ’em with the sauce
I'm a killa, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill ’em
Kill ’em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill ’em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Woo, I’ma straight dog on you crooked cats
They tore down where my hood was at, I come from where you shouldn't lack
Was running 'round the field, yeah, like I took a lap
Zip block bags with kush in that (But hey), no more joogin' packs (Took off)
I ain't looking back (Sauce), rap god cooking crack (Lyrics)
I'm too good with that, it's so unfair I shouldn't rap
I've mastered this, I whip the track, I'm who your bitch was looking at
I slide up in her in front of the mirror, I Iook good in that
Doggy style I smack her ass, I grab her hair, I pull it back
My pockets fat, her pussy fat, she still can't get none, Sister Act
They can't take me or put me back, me and my squad ambush the track
And me and TO3 go back like baggy clothes and crooked hats
(Haters) No, they couldn't match (I know) it hurts to look at stats
'Cause when it comes to bodies, yeah, my old opps know what's good with that
Put money down, they shook like craps, I'm with that steel, I look like Jax
Write down what y'all need and they right back up like they took a nap
Then I look at my girl just like Kobe Bryant used to look at Shaq
Choppers on deck, I get shit crackin' like a wooden bat
Be careful who you woofin' at, I promise you, you could get whacked
Don't flip your wig, I'll push it back, my kids pure like when Pusha rap
Go pull his back, I'm puttin' cats, leave pussies where we douche 'em at
Then peel out on them bitches like I'm Bill Jell-O puddin' packs
Killa with the sauce, what the fuck these niggas thought?
They say my lyrics piss 'em off, get out your feelings, bitch you soft, yeah

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
I'm a killa, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't play games like Nintendo, but when I'm blowin' this cartridge
Bet all dem fall like it's August, I put 'em all up in coffins
Keep that steel on me, Colossus, turnt all my niggas to bosses
The whole world could quit on me, go M-I-A like the Dolphins
Bitch I'ma get it regardless, I got more drip than a faucet
Don't expect life to be flawless, what have you learned from your losses? (Huh?)
You can't live off hopes and wishes, fragile to you, broke the dishes
You can learn through all these bars and you don't have to go to prison
Bible say to follow Jesus, Jesus was of no religion
If I'm not home then I'm headed to the door, Jehovah Witness
Strapped up on that road to riches, sauce at every show, I'm drippin'
Wings up, pose for pictures, I got flavor, so delicious
Player's club, diamonds dancin', I got money, pour some pitchers
Go the distance, go ballistic, big spendin', throw the discus
Big racks and straps like double Ds, L-Vs on down for double Gs
Michael Jordan jersey on, ink all down my fuckin' sleeve
No confession, I'm comin' clean and bitches wanna fuck my team
Because we all breaded 'round this bitch just like some onion rings
Bad bitch on her fuckin' knees while I count a hundred Gs
You play here, pop in R&B, then it's a wrap, my gun gon' sing
Shootin' out the window, thought my car transformed to Bumblebee
Choppers split your double chin then I rolled off like tumbleweed
Bitches gettin' fucked, niggas gettin' chalked
And I ain't Jesus Christ, I'm the wrong nigga to cross, yeah

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
I'm a killa, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
Kill 'em with the sauce, kill 'em with the sauce
Kill 'em with the sauce, uh huh, yeah
