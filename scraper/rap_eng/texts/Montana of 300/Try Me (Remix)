[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

[Verse 1]
Ay let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a kill his whole mothafuckin' family
Put him on TV like the Cosbys
I'll be bustin' through ya door like it's Johnny
Got the shotty in my pants walkin' like a zombie
Black gloves, black mask when I'm doin' grimey
Everybody gettin' headshots like an I.D
Follow niggas just to shoot 'em like the paparazzi
And I ain't spairin' nobody
I'll pop up at his wake and kill his fuckin' auntie
Keep that 40 right beside me like we Siamese
I stay ready 24/7 tell 'em come and find me
Kill you then go kill a beat that's a double homi
I'm Lebron with the heat Jordan in the 90's
I'm the fuckin' greatest, Ali
Tyson mixed with Floyd that's why the wanna sign me
Snap my fingers bitches on me it's like I'm Fonzie
Need a bitch that's 'bout her money like Bonny
I got shooters right beside me and more behind me
My two chains iceberg but you ain't gon' rob me
Make a gangsta lean pop him like a molly
We gon' leave him with the show, money and a body
Shout out my nigga G-boy shout out to Don D
Broski high as palm trees lookin' Chinese
Shout out to my fans I promise to keep it comin'
Same nigga still strapped still reppin' dirty or nothin' man
I been sonning you niggas, I feel like I'm Mr. Drummond
Packin' heat just like an oven you niggas know how I'm comin'
Got that 30 and this 40 Nick Cannon how I be drummin'
I put niggas underground I feel like Harriet Tubman
Hope them angels watchin' over you and you real good at duckin'
Once I up that bitch
I'm bussin' my nigga ain't no discussion
40 bang 'em in the head boy that ain't no concussion
Keep that nina in the club I told Keisha to sneak the gun in
Get to fussin' and my girl gon' smoke him like David Ruffin and
Got you main bitch on my woody so niggas know that I'm buzzin'
Puttin' dick up in your women she feel it all in her stomach
While working 9 to 5s I'm piping her like I'm plumbin'
Talkin' shit ridin' clean sumthin' like a preacher
Black tints super keyed up with my heater
Steppin' out fresh as hell everyday it's Easter
Tell them haters move around like they fuckin' lease up
High school gettin' head from my student teacher
Big shout out to Tina she was an eater
Boy there's level to this monster I feel like Frieza
Illest nigga to ever come out a set of speakers
Everytime I drop a remix the rappers freeze up
Bitch I gotta feed my sons I won't ever ease up
Got a bitch that got a friend say she wanna team up
Shawty always call me when she want that pussy beat up
Ass fatter than Serena you shoulda seen her
Put that bitch up on the wall y'all Mona Lisa
Then I laid her on her back while I had her feet up
She like when I fuck her slow and when I speed up
All my haters in the bleachers get your cheese up
If you really doin' you then what you watching me for
Homie you don't wanna smoke you don't want no beef bruh
Slide on money like a Visa and get to squeezin'
Only aimin' at your windows glass cleaner
Cook a nigga slide him in a box like a pizza
Pussy, catch a body then catch amnesia
Ain't no talkin' to the refs get your ass T'd up

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

[Outro: Montana of 300]
Ay let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a kill his whole mothafuckin' family
I swear to god I ain't playin' with no body
Ask about me and my niggas bitch we got them bodies
Ay let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a kill his whole mothafuckin' family
I swear to god I ain't playin' with no body
Ask about me and my niggas bitch we got them bodies
