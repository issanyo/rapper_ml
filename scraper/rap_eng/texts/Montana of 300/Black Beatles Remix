[Intro: Montana of 300]
Rap God lookin' like I'm black Jesus
FGE No Surrender No Retreat (humming)
Album dropping January 17th!

[Hook: Jalyn Sanders]
Money got it cash and Visa
Never go nowhere without no heat
Haters mad for whatever reason
[Gunshot] Pop his top watch him fall slowly
Backshots, shawty's ass fat as Serena
She serve me up down to do the whole team
FGE these other niggas so beneath us
Fly Guys No Surrender No Retreat

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Tatted on my face I'm a inkhead
Mixing Henny with Ros√© bitch I drink red
Like I'm blood thirsty, bad bitches under me
Dime beavers but to me they only fuck-worthy
Pill poppin' yeah they rockin' we some rollers
Told her not to fight it she let it control her
I'ma have her drop it 'til she tell me hold up
Give your girl a spankin' and let you console her
All around playa bitch, a pimp without the gators
All these ratchets with the flavors
Drippin' bitches tryna taste us
Stacking chips on a trip
Won't never let a hater take us
Last one try me caught the vapors
Drop ya shit like hot potatoes
Bringing static like I'm major
A addict by my paper
Yeah I'm leavin 'em I gas
Like helium I'm on my way up
Bring the matches to the hater
On ya block I block ya later
Like to play in Vegas but I rock out like a crater

[Verse 2: $avage]
Let her know I'm in the city for the weekend
Hit the show do the most then we leavin'
Act up and my niggas get to tweakin' ay
Cut the roof off the coupe like The Weeknd ay
Bad hoes keep our music on repeat
Fly Guys No Surrender No Re-treat
Only high tec, no weak drink
Xannin' hard I done fell into a deep sleep
Off the Xans and I'm not sleepin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
Big bank on you lil' bank ass niggas
I'm a shark all you fish tank ass niggas
They treat me and my amigos like the
Fuckin' black beatles I'm the one goin' dumb with
Them drums call me Ringo
No casino blow me like some candles on ya birthday
Gold hangin' on my neck so she know I'm first place, MOB

[Hook: Jalyn Sanders]
Money, got it cash and Visa
Never go nowhere without no heat
Haters mad for whatever reason
Pop his top watch him fall slowly (slowly)
Backshots, shawty's ass fat as Serena
She serve me up down to do the whole team (whole team)
FGE these other niggas so beneath us
Fly Guys No Surrender No Retreat

[Verse 3: No Fatigue]
'Tigue shit man
I be flexin' look like money when you see him
Ay I hit the stage and get it bustin' like yo BM
Ay after the show she choose a playa like a GM
Hit her from the back she say ooouuu what I'm 3 M's
I like all my bitches thick, yeah deep dish
And check my pockets, yeah them bitches thick
Looking deep dish, bro got that rocket if a nigga
Want it yeah I beep shit

Or I'm slidin' hoes goin' just like live, yeah
On the come up everyday like the horizon
No Ellen no but I do shits for I, yeah
Her head fire, she eat me, Jambalaya

[Verse 4: Montana of 300]
I used to sell reefer
Now I'm 7k a feature
He think his bitch is a keeper
That bitch went fast as a cheetah
His bitch on me cuz she see I'm fly as hell boy
Watch my dick slide in that pussy pink as hell boy
Jacket open big ass forty bitch I'm Hell Boy
Versace on me bitch I think I'm Uncle Elroy
I get that dough I got that bag I'm like a bellboy
Caught two bodies thank God I ain't go to jail for it
Rap God I'm a rock star
Every line's a hot bar
Beef with me it's not smart
I will let them Glocks spark
You'll get wet up pussy nigga you are not hard
I swear these squares soft in the middle like some pop tarts
Big toaster light his top up like a cop car
Give his top ten, he got hits just like the pop charts

[Hook: Jalyn Sanders]
Money, got it cash and Visa
Never go nowhere without no heat
Haters mad for whatever reason
Pop his top watch him fall slowly (slowly)
Backshots, shawty's ass fat as Serena
She serve me up down to do the whole team (whole team)
