[Chorus]
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see

[Verse 1]
I know you see all this designer and all this money
And I got hoes in other countries that want to fuck me
You see the drip but this ain't honey, lil' bitch, ain't nothin sweet
Don't need my bro's, I might come one deep and let my gun speak
This bitch got kick, I call her Chun-Li, you'll be the one sleep
Get dropped and stretched just like a bungee, they'll say it was me
And when ya'll see that pussy bleed, bitch, it ain't no monthly
Come to your pad, get on your ass, boy, don't get too comfy
Hundred round chopper that bitch hug me, I think it love me
It just keep shootin' like it's rusty, that bitch look lovely
And when I tell you I got shotgun, it ain't the front seat
Armed with that strap just like a junkie, come try to touch me
Yeah, yeah
Bitch, I keep the pole, I come from where it's freezing cold
Turn up until my speakers blow
At your neck like a sleeper hold
Firing TEC's 'til your eyes is shut
Sleep, but this time you'll keep 'em closed
No more dreams and goals, and no bitches, they'll see you leave a hoe

[Chorus]
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see

[Verse 2]
I got more flavor than a smoothie, we keep them toolies
Them bitches be at all my shows, yeah, like a groupie
Inside Burberry or this Gucci, this shit get spooky
I turn your diamonds into rubies, with this Uzi
Aye, aye
That money maker, I hope it don't let my money make you
Come fuck with mine, get a tombstone, Undertaker
Try and touch me, I been on point like a cactus, nigga
If he feel he ready, A.I, ain't talkin' 'bout practice, nigga
When I come across him, no question, I bet I whack this nigga
Caught him in bed and shot him dead, air mattress, nigga (woo)
That ain't smart, niggas talk like Shannon Sharpe
Until I come through after dark, with big choppers like a shark
It ain't just bars we let 'em swing after we slide just like a park
They never thought they'd see this rapper at they necks just like a scarf
I'm a dog without the bark
He's the Tin-Man with no heart
But if he act like Iron Man, I'll light his chest up, Tony Stark

[Chorus]
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see
Don't think shit sweet cause you see money, this shit get ugly
My shooters with me be goin dummy, my niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, trust me
You'll get zipped up just like a onesie, my nigga, come see
