[Hook: Montana of 300]
I'm ridin' with my goonies
We all we got, came from the bottom with my goonies
Straight to the top, you know I'm climbin' with my goonies
You lookin' for me, you can find me with that tooly
Grindin' with my goonies
I'm ridin' with my goonies
We all we got, came from the bottom with my goonies
Straight to the top, you know I'm climbin' with my goonies
You lookin' for me, you can find me with that tooly
Grindin' with my goonies

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
I'm ridin' with my goonies, it's not a movie
Bitch, we really tote them toolies, just bought a uzi
Pop a opp just like a rufie, hangover goofies
Wet yo ass like a jacuzzi, get smoked like pooky
Concrete jungles where we hustle
They show love but they don't love you
I'm a dog, I need a muzzle
I done did more dirt than shovels
I done been in hella traps, I had to dig up out that tunnel
We bought guns to build our muscle, ain't no takin' from this puzzle
We kick doors to get our foot in, did things we shouldn't
Hustlin', strugglin', we was pullin', finessin', juggin'
I still rep the hood I stood in, disrespect, I'm trigger pullin'
With this ratchet, I'm bout action, no acting, no Cuba Goodin'
Pull that mac out, then I black out, let off this pain
I never been the type to tap out, heroine had my OG noddin', bout to pass out
No one, I really, really, lived up in the traphouse, couldn't pull no map out

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Breakin' bread, Jesus, yeah
Diamond teeth, rubber band bar
Round table, Bread Winner subject
Big discussion with the other landlord
Sellin' tan, art my God, youngin' wiggin on the xan bar
'Bout to light a stick of cancer, got along with a dancer
Hustlin', I'm not retirin' man
Blowin' the loud, I get high everyday
Movin' in silence, try me
We open fire, just like a firing range
When the love gone, don't come around
(Gun noises), shells on the ground
Free my nigga Rule Boy Blacka
Prison cell, I pray you make it out
Lately, I've been prayin' on the loud
Never no respond to me at all
I am not afraid to be a muslim
Christian people look at me and frown
Fuck the haters, I'mma keep it pushin'
In my circle, they are not allowed
We on now, don't come around
Pay cuts, handshake and smile
But nothin' public, thuggin', crack a smile
I just flew another nigga but
Shorty say she love if I was dressin' bummy
Probably wouldn't wanna stand in front of me
I'm a shooter with a shooter
Bred to win, but born a loser
I done came to the conclusion
This is just a big illusion
