[Hook x2]
She be like "Tony I don't trust ya"
You know I love ya, never put nothin' above ya
"But you a rapper, I don't wanna be a sucka"
She don't believe me, I can tell she wanna leave but love how I fuck her

[Verse 1]
She be like "Tony I don't trust ya"
She love my D, plus all these other niggas bustas
I stroke that pussy nice and slow like I was Usher
Leave her exhausted when I pipe her like a muffler, shake when I touch her
She said I'm takin' her for granted
She said I'm selfish and I'm stubborn, she can't stand it
Swear up and down I stole her heart just like a bandit, ain't how she planned it
She said I got a long stick and got game like I'm Gambit
She be complainin', she be naggin'
But don't complain about a thing when I be smashin'
We ain't just fuckin', shorty love me with a passion
Just what a G need, I'm Aladdin, she my Jasmine, love everlastin'
If it ain't one thing, it's another
Went from friends and turned to lovers
But she act like a detective when we ain't up under covers
Man I swear she always tryna bring up old shit like a plunger
She go off just like a buzzer, that's my baby and I love her

[Hook x2]
She be like "Tony I don't trust ya"
You know I love ya, never put nothin' above ya
"But you a rapper, I don't wanna be a sucka"
She don't believe me, I can tell she wanna leave but love how I fuck her

[Verse 2]
(She said) I make her mad (sometimes) I make her sad
She cuss me out, then take it back
I make her laugh, escape the past
I break her back, then I go chase a bag
Shorty think that I be pimpin'
Always trippin' up until I slide my dick in
This dick too long for her to try to keep her distance, feelin' defenseless
Yeah I could tell she a need a fixin', Imma come fix it
She know that shit 'bout to be lit when I roll up like dutches
That pussy instantly get wet every time that I touch it
She love the way I pull her hair when she go down and suck it
She love the way I grip that ass, how I smack it and cuff it
The way I choke her when I stroke her, she love all that rough shit
I beat that pussy like a drumstick, makin' her cum quick
She can't get up, can barely walk man she gon' need some crutches
I put an end to all that fussin', end of discussion

[Hook x2]
She be like "Tony I don't trust ya"
You know I love ya, never put nothin' above ya
"But you a rapper, I don't wanna be a sucka"
She don't believe me, I can tell she wanna leave but love how I fuck her
