[Hook: Montana of 300]
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)

[Verse 1: Talley of 300]
Your flame ain't high enough
Still, I suit up, bring them boys to put that lil shit out like a firetruck
Speakin' of trucks I'm a monster, you talkin' 'bout rollin', better get your tires up
No energy services but when I visit your home it's to light it up
You love em, we tie em up
'Less I feel like their time is up
It ain't grade school but we line em up
Anything sweet, it's some kind of dust
While you be with the rats like you Donald Duck
It's irrelevant to put the nail on the reason they hatin' us
Just know if you pull a hoe,  reap what you sow, like I sold a penny, I'm takin' one
One after one, 'till they payin' up
Bodies gon' drop if they get out of hand
When this at your ear, you gon' hear what I'm sayin'
All of that dirt gon' turn into quicksand
Too late to get out the shit that you in
Set's in yo throat
I guarantee you gon' choke
Your section don't want no smoke
I do a hit, blow you away like that dope
Ashes to ashes, you go
You bastards should know

[Hook: Montana of 300]
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
FGE bitch, I'm just way too fly to land
Watch out, my chain swing like it's spiderman
If you think this shit sweet, then come try it fam
I'll be sprayin' shit up like a fireman
Cookin' em just like a frying pan
I bet money that pussy won't try again
Tony keep the steel on him like iron man
You better hope that my iron jam
Got a .40 with a 30 in this bitch and it don't hold back
Try to run up, ran up on him in the mornin', made that bitch go brrap
Try to pull it with my niggas pullin' triggers, boy yo ass gon' die
All facts, no lie, put that strap to his neck, bowtie
Get smoked like a cluck
Like asthma I come with that pump
Don't get your ass popped like a trunk
Flow cold like a hockey rink but I will slide like a puck
Pull up sprayin' like I was a skunk
I don't give no fuck
It's fuck all you niggas like Trump
Like Donald bitch, you better duck
Was runnin' your mouth, now you ran out of luck
I pull up like a garbage man, hop out and dump
Don't get your ass slumped

[Hook: Montana of 300]
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)
No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)
No joke, get smoked
Like dope, you don't want no smoke (no smoke)
