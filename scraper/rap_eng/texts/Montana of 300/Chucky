Every day I shut up got a killer
Ain’t nobody fuck with me
How many niggas that you know would ride in the streets
You a hit, uncle beat, I’mma side with this bitch
We got beaf, we got honey

All my niggas try to blow, ain’t no high in the city

How many niggas that you know would ride in the streets
You a hit, uncle beat, I’mma side with this bitch

All my niggas try to blow, ain’t no high in the city
