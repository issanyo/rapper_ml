[Intro]
I love my bitch [x4]

[Hook][x2]
She bought me that, she bought me this
Yeah, I love my bitch
She never rat, she never snitch
No no, I love my bitch
She got my back, she make me rich
Yeah, I love my bitch
She throw it back, she super thick
Uh huh, I love my bitch

[Verse 1]
She bought me that and bought me this
Yeah, I love my bitch
She bought me fits and bought me kicks
Yeah, I love my bitch
She put all that ice in my wrist
Yes, I love my bitch
She bought me houses, bought me whips
Uh huh, I love my bitch
See she love me and I love her, I never get tired of her
Me and my bitch knotted up, connected till our time is up
Riding down the fucking strip, all these nigga’s bitches thirsty, wanna jump on dick
And I put that on 300, I don’t stunt on shit
Honest to god, I promise I done did a bunch of shit
And no homo when I tell you that I’m fucking rich
And tell them haters I be waiting when they come for it
Make sure you tell em that this murder shit gon come with it
Ain’t talking waste baskets when I say I be dumping clips
No fucking minute man, but beeyoch I be busting quick
My car be gon in 60 seconds when I jump in it
Back to my fucking bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I check on her, make sure she straight
No implants over here, but never came up boobie fake
Me and my boo be on a Prada Gucci Louis date
Got all this moolah on me, goofy think that tooly ain’t?
Click clack, I love my bitch
Realest shit, no baby nate
Real nigga, ain’t Nathan fake
Your bitch want my jake the snake, she want to see how great it taste
I hustle hard, no taking breaks
I’m making cake, so they can hate
I’m fortyed up, my thirty clip
Be action packed like Jason Statham
So now you know what I be bout, them fucking chips
I get jammed up she buy me out, yeah, I love my bitch
She never fuss, no acting up, I swear my bitch bad as fuck
We hit the club and flick it up, got these haters mad at us
We so caked up, she thick as fuck, and plus I’m tatted up
Dip in and grip her then I flip her like a spatula
This shit I’m talking ain’t barking, my bitch can back it up
My cash is up, I add it up, she help me stack it up

[Hook]
