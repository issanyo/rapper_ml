[Verse 1: Jalyn Sanders]
I'ma count it twice, gotta make sure it's all here
I don't need a invite, gotta make sure it's out here
Cause i got them killers, gotta get it any way
Gotta get paid
After she fuck me and suck me she gotta go
I gotta kick her out like I'm Lui Kang
Gotta flip it make it tumble baby
Money talkin' Jimmy Kimmel baby
I gotta get back on the road, gotta get back to these shows
Gotta get back at you more
I run the track up you know it
Might fuck around and just blow it
Might just come back to your town
Cause I know you want it right now
And I know you really miss it

And I know you need a fixin'
Put that pipe down I know you fiendin' for a fixing

[Verse 2: Talley of 300]
Like private tutors she make home visits
Soon as she hit the door we gon' get it
Give it to her let her have that
Then I'm headed where the cash at
But before she get her bags packed
I'ma pound it like a hashtag

[Verse 3: $avage]
You know I'ma run it up like I'm a halfback
Get in that pussy drive her crazy like I'm Mad Max
Another body on my belt I had to add that
She knowin' just how I do her I'm trained to go like my shooters

[Verse 4: Montana of 300]
She blow me just like a tuba
And give me brain like a tutor
I spank her ass with this ruler
Then pick her up like a Uber
I cut her like Freddy Krueger
She understands my maneuvers
Yeah, she know after I do her I gotta go get that mulah
Squa!

[Hook: Jalyn Sanders]
