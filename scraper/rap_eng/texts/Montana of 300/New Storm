[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
They never seen it coming
Way before he was buzzing, he was hustling
Now he getting paid for giving beats concussions
He forced himself to snap out of it and stop dreaming of it
Start bringing substance and murdering everything he touching
They got me started, I'm Leatherfaces chainsaw
Freddy Kruegers glove, John Travolta take your face off
Wacking shit until you get the picture this ain't baseball
I'm nobody's slave y'all, rap god Imma save y'all
Punchlines going nuts, Johnny Cage y'all
Nah, they can not see me like they Ray Charles
Fuck that they can not see me like I'm Adolf
And my flow got more bodies than a graveyard
Cursed with a blessing, my sickness is where my strength is
The truthest god is my witness, the sun rose from the trenches
I'm independent and getting it, don't owe no one for expenses
Ain't moving unless it's business, the simple minded ain't getting it
And FGE be the squad
I got a whip no garage
Execution is my job
I'm Farrakhan in the mass
[?] beat like the mob
Can get you wacked, get you robbed
Don't think this shit a mirage
We wetting shit like a spa
Going against the odds still giving glory to god
And bodied so many rappers, shit I should make a collage
I'm charging them like it's dodge
They hook like a fish and a rod
I'm eating off of my pain and I throw it up like a lob
