[Chorus]
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)
I made shit right, shit coulda went the wrong way (Wrong way)
My mama told me that you fuck niggas gon' hate (Gon' hate)
I told her that's okay, if they run up I'm gon' spray (B-r-r-r)
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)
I made shit right, shit coulda went the wrong way (Wrong way)
My mama told me (My mama told me) that you fuck niggas gon' hate (Gon' hate)
I told her that's okay, if they run up I'm gon' spray (Gon' spray) (B-r-r-r-ah)

[Verse 1]
Look
I came from hunger cries (Yeah), watchin' my mother strive (Yeah)
Watchin' my brothers die (Yo), others buried under time (Yup)
So fuck all y'all cunnin' lies (Fuck), I see through all y'all covered lives (Yup)
Everybody traumatized (Yo), so fuck how y'all justify
Bitch, I keep my cannons up (Woo), ain't nobody made no plan for us (Woo)
I'll be damned if I ain't standin' up (Woo), our current Presidents are bad enough (Bad)
In action like they got the cameras on, no actin' bitch, it ain't no playin' with us (Nah)
Three rounds for the amateurs, it's dirty you don't wanna dance with us (Nah)
Lord knows I was headed the wrong way
And the nina was blowin' (Blowin') and you know it's on faith
Hit an opp on my block (Block), that shit gon' go a long way
Yeah, that's when shit was dark (Dark), I made it rain in broad day (Day)
Look at me now, nigga (Look), remember when I used to frown, nigga? (Yup)
Everybody lookin' down, nigga? (Yeah) now they wanna be around niggas (Fuck)
Teach 'em no amount of ropes in this water, makin' sure they never drown, nigga (Look)
Lifeguard, I know the sharks around, nigga, and I'm make sure everybody sound, nigga
Squa-

[Chorus]
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)
I made shit right, shit coulda went the wrong way (Wrong way)
My mama told me that you fuck niggas gon' hate (Gon' hate)
I told her that's okay, if they run up I'm gon' spray (B-r-r-r)
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)

[Verse 2]
They makin' comments while I'm makin' moves, all these faces blue
It's gon' cost just to see the boss, bitch, this Pay-Per-View
Back on me, try to plot on me, boy I'll pray for you
You gon' learn like on your way to school, not to play with dude
Go on and do it, Tim from Home Improvement, bitch I stay with tools
I'm at the crib, big sticks on the table, I ain't playin' pool
I'm all ready, tell 'em play and lose, I'll spray when they intrude
I'll leave 'em lyin', this ain't April Fool's, bitch you'll make the news
Stuck in the dezzy, I had the gun by my belly, ballin' like Buns off of Belly
Was sellin' mixtapes straight out the trunk of my Chevy, the streets though, they fucked with it heavy (Whoo)
See, up in the books, we ain't had shit, you woulda thought we was fastin'
Was all up in school, breakin' them rules and sellin' packs in between classes
Tryna see who could get it the fastest, shit, I coulda been in a casket
But I gave 'em shots like a basket, had to smoke 'em and drop 'em like ashes
I took out haters like a bouncer, better ask my old opps, they could voucher
Mama worried about me in the streets, back and forth on that highway like three times a week (Facts)
I finally walked out of the trap (Facts), started bendin' that dough like a pretzel (Yeah)
Wasn't takin' no slaps on the wrist (Uh), I was facin' more time than a bezel
Mama told me when you shine too hard, they police gonna wanna arrest you
And a couple of niggas gon' test you, better make 'em say uncle like nephew
And these bitches gon' try to impress you, have your baby then try to finesse you
Then she told me, "Tony, I suggest you watch the ones to your right and your left, too"
From the ones that been with you from day one, to the last person you sent a text to
Never let the fake fit in your schedule, if I didn't love you, I wouldn't correct you

[Chorus]
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)
I made shit right, shit coulda went the wrong way (Wrong way)
My mama told me that you fuck niggas gon' hate (Gon' hate)
I told her that's okay, if they run up I'm gon' spray (B-r-r-r)
Lord knows that I done came a long way (Long way)
I made shit right, shit coulda went the wrong way (Way)
My mama told me (My mama told me) that you fuck niggas gon' hate (Gon' hate)
I told her that's okay, if they run up I'm gon' spray (Gon' spray) (B-r-r-r-ah)
