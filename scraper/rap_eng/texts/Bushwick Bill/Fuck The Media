Yeah, getting ready to slash to media...
You see, what you need to do is start jocking the right information...

Fuck the media coming straight from The Terrorists crew
I don't love none of ya'll hoes so fuck you
You never understand the things I write
Until you spend a night in the South Park twilight
I'm steadily trying to reach my black folks
But all you wanna see is a nigga with black locs
And you be knowing what the fuck we be saying
And you know damn well we ain't playing
Now, as simple as that, stop spreading lies
Before I place M-60 right between your eyes (Yikes!)
Cause now ya'll got me mad as hell
And all you jealous pens' writing tattle tales
But I don't give a fuck about your ass
See, ya'll just mad a nigga rolling in cold cash
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot
Now I got a lot
And I'll be damned to let you fuck over what I got
I kick that knowledge on a roughest tip
Call Egypt soft, you be bloody with a busted lip
All because I rap with a slang and hang...
With the South Park Coalition game
Together forever, hard niggas real tight
Everybody strapped with them 9's and we will fight
Crashing bodies and throwin 'em in the trash
Grab their pens and pads and shove it up their ass
Fuck the media...
