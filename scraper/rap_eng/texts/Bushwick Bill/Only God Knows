[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill]
Every now and then I stop to think about my life
Wonderin' if it's even worth this stressin' tryin' to strive
All I ever do is get high everyday
Even fuck my girl then I sleep the rest away
I rarely comes out before night I ain't employed
Why should I wake up early in the muthafuckin' morning
All Imma do is smoke a sack of green
And throw 2 or 3 rocks at the penitentiary
No one seems concerned about my world beein'
It seems my life's already ended that's why I'm spendin'
So much time in the 5th ward high as a kite
It's too late for me to try to live my life right
Shit, if I should die today who would really care?
If I should die today who would come and stare?
If I should die today who would carry me?
On my last day above dirt and who would bury me?
Damn...!!

[Chorus]
How will I die?
(Homie only God knows)
How long will I live?
(Homie only God knows)
How will I die?
(Homie only God knows)
How long will I live?
Tell me...damn

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
What is life and just how long will it last?
Will you be happy and satisfied when you've passed?
Will you die young or old and wise?
If you face your killer will there be tears in your eyes?
Will you holler and backscream and crawl?
Will you die like a bitch or stand tall thru it all?
Will you fight if you're givin' the chance?
Or will you ball up like a baby and shit in your pants?
Damn..!
We'll never know until it's your time Loc
You'll never know what you gon do until that ass get smoked
So you can miss me with that tough man trash
Until you're layin' in the streets with hollow tips in that ass
Hot metal to the dome couldn't take me away
I'm talkin' point blank range and I'm still here today
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
When I lay my head to rest now who could answer me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bushwick Bill]
I'm in so much pain it hurts my heart to wake up
I've done lost my sense of gain I feel about to brake up
Stress is eatin' and my mind is playin' tricks again
It's tellin' me that I ain't shit
It's tellin' me to quit
In one's words: when I stop to think a kind of agree
Even with one good eye my future's hard to see
The end is rushin' at me homie shit I damned it down
I tries to duck I tries to hide but shit I just can't run
It's like I'm trapped inside this world of mines and just can't win
I'm overcomed by suicidal thoughts but damned that's sin
I need my mama cause she'd be always there by my side
To help me out when I ain't strong enough to make the right
If I die who would teach my sons right from wrong?
If I die who would teach my sons to stand strong?
If I die who would teach 'em nuthin' comes for free?
I can't die cause won't nobody teach 'em shit but me
Damn

[Chorus x2]
Tell me, somebody
