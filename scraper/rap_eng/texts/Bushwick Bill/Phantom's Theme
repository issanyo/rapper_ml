[Bushwick Bill & woman]
(Bushwick I got to get this bio done
The record company keeps calling up)
Ah
(Look)
Whatever
(Bushwick you know I'm cool with you)
Right
(But you know how the press is
The media, they)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(They don't understand rap
And they certainly don't understand you)
Right
(So, I just got to ask you some questions for the new bio)
Aight, make it quick, what is it?
(Cool, okay, first question Bushwick:
Why did you decide to name the album Phantom of the Rapra?)
Well, I named it Phantom of the Rapra cause I like opera
And it deals with sex, rape, violence, incest, and suicide
You know
And it's accepted by the same people
That are willing to ban rap
When rap is opera to people in the ghettos
Cause it's dealing with the same issues
(Okay, I can understand about rap and opera
You know "rapra"
But, Bushwick, where does the phantom come from?
Where does the phantom fit in?)
Heh, it's a secret
(Bushwick, what are the secrets that are hidden in the temple?)
Haha
