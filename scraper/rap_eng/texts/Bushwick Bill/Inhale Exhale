[Intro: Bushwick Bill & Menace Clan]
(Niggas wanna smoke)
Oh my fucking goodness
(Niggas wanna smoke Bill, I'm tellin' you man)
Ehehehehe
Oh boy
(You understand, get fucked up, you know what I'm sayin')
(Treat this shit like you know, you know how we do nigga)
Goin' off around here
Ehehehehahaha
(I don't even where nigga, fuck that, nigga)
Goin' off around here
(Nah nigga)
Y'all come back now ya hear?
(Smoke this shit right here)
(Check this out)

[Verse 1: Menace Clan]
Look what I did
I scored a lid
Now I'm high as fuck
Cause I smoked it deep down my throat
Damn near bust a gut
What the fuck?
Thought I heard a truck crash, through my room
Damn near pissed my Fruit of the Looms, man

Nigga you be tweakin'
Every weekend we have smoke-outs, choke-outs
What I tell ya about smokin' that shit?
Pass it to me, so I can take a hit (alright)
Inhale, find my brain cells
Exhale, light another joint
Oh well, I'm not Bill Clinton
So I just...

[Chorus: Menace Clan]
(Inhale)
Until I'm feeling smoke
'Til my mind feels high
(Exhale)
When I'm always 'bout the choke

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
(Smoke some)
Can't get none
This one got my name on it
I'm Bushwickin' Bill
Roll another, smoke together
I'm gon' kill this one
I've got to get my mind tight
So I can bust this shit right
Can't see the stage through the fog

[Verse 3: Menace Clan]
I stepped into a cloud of smoke
Choke, I get fucked up off gin
Then, do it again
Now I'm drinking Hennessy
Menace C-L-A-N
Hittin' endo
Po' mo' drink into my fucking cup
If you look at my eyes
You can see that I'm fucked up
But can I hit that?
I'm with that six-pack
That shit that you smokin' too
Ooh, that's endo
I'm from South-Central
We smoke good shit
Nigga, you can't see me in rappin'
You smokin' bullshit
I'm down with Bushwick
Took shit to the other level of the game
When I get high off mary jane
Cause I just...

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4: Menace Clan]
All of the smoke
You got my vote on another one
Chri-zon got me floatin'
Smokin' with the Jetsons
Every second is an hour
Every hour is a century
I'm from South-Central
So ya know I'm thinking vi-lent-ly
Chri-zon, whi-zon
Got this shit like Vietnam
Niggas blastin' shit, leaving it like napalm
Hit it, then pass it back
I'm on this shit like crack
You lucky that you smokin' fool
This my only bag muthafucka
So why you wanna suck shit up?

[Verse 5: Bushwick Bill]
I don't give a fuck
You made mistakes before
Now it's in the hands of Chuckwick
I've got to get my shit lit
You know I'm not gon' pass it
So why the fuck you askin'?
Ain't nothin' happenin'
Ya best to blaze ya own guz
Cause I'm the last muthafucka that ever wanna trust
With them herbals
I give them fools verbal lectures
Can this ghetto boy get high off this killa here in Texas?
(Ya eyes are bloodshot)
You blood clot, I love pot
I smoke up all that killin'
I took yo' spot
And I won't spot
Bad-um, why ask why do I get high when I get high?
When I'm done I just come back and I get high as I...

[Chorus x4]

[Outro]
No muthafuckin' joke
