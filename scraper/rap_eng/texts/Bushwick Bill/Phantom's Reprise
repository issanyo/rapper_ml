[Bushwick Bill & woman]
(What do you mean you can still see it?)
I can still see the stars and stripes of the American flags
The stars would represent the badge of the oppressors and the stripes would represent the oppressed who are held behind bars
(Well, Bushwick where should I pledge my allegiance?)
Uh-heh
Only God knows, cause it all looks grim to me
Everyone who say they are really ain't
It's like, it's like they all wear a mask
Ya know what I'm saying, which allusion is the ultimate weapon?
(Is that the secret that's hidden in the temple?)
Precisely
We all have to use our own "temple" to find out the hidden secrets... within
