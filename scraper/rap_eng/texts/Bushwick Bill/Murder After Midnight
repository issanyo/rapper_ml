(There's gonna be a killin after midnight)

Say what?

[ Big Mike ]
Niggas bustin caps on a Sunday
I'm ridin through the park with my white six bloody
Thinkin to myself, What the fuck is this?
I grab my motherfuckin shit, load the clip and then I get
The extra hollow points out the box in the backseat
I can't believe these motherfuckers tried to x me
Once again I'm in the middle of some fuck shit
A busted window and a dead nigga they left me stuck with
I grabbed the cellular phone and called my nigga Face
Had to beep him 911, he wasn't at his place
The phone rang, I picked it up, I heard, What's up, black?
Some ho-ass niggas bust a cap and shot my nigga Mack
They killed my nigga, now I think them hoes are after me
Just dump the body and meet me over at the draft, G
7 o'clock I dumped the body, now I'm changin cars
Get 'em up with Face, now it's time to take them hoes to war
Called up Billy, told him to meet us on the southwest
Bring a bag of buddha cess and a extra vest
And a fifth of E&J to get this shit right
Cause it's about to be a murder after midnight

(There's gonna be a killin after midnight)
(You can say this one's a murder by a lunatic)

Say what?

[ Scarface ]
3 or 4 minutes to twelve o'clock
Rollin in a undercover huntin for a IRoc
Let's hit the spot and find them hoes who tried to cap ya
Were they killers, yeah, or were they tryina jack ya?
It's hard to tell, we lost our boy behind this punk shit
And when we catch him we gon' chuck him in the trunk, slick
I gives a fuck about the sorry motherfucker
He crossed the family, now I'mma make the nigga suffer
I'm rollin hard, I got my daddy's Smith & Wesson
Six-shot, nickel-plated .357
So keep your eyes peeled, nigga, we gotta find 'em
Turn off the lights and let's creep up behind 'em
We got some burners protectin us
But keep a low pro cause they'll be expectin us
We spotted a Z off at Quarter Lane
I'm killin the bitch, I don't know the man
Creeped up slow, dropped the back window
Hehe... now what's up, ho?
Let off a couple of shots but he had posse
The nigga came out the door and like just shot me
It didn't hit me cause I ducked down
We jumped our ass out the car and turned that bitch into Bucktown
I bring my gats to a fist fight
And bust a cap in a bitch and it ain't gotta be at midnight

(There's gonna be a killin after midnight)

[ Bushwick Bill ]
11:45 I pull up on the set
With some down-ass niggas and a van full of gats
Jumped out, fired up my Phillie, went to bustin shots
Had to let 'em know Bushwick Bill was on the fuckin block
Niggas started haulin as I heard Big Mike callin
Jumped in the van, slammed the door and started haulin
Ass around the corner, catch the niggas who had ran
Oki jumped out and went to bust him once again
Uh, makin niggas take cover fast
Cause we was puttin somethin on they motherfuckin ass
Yeah, nine millimeter shells, twelve gauge pumps and shit
So nigga, don't bother runnin for your trunk and shit
1-2-3-4 shots from the infra-red
Left 1-2-3-4 motherfuckers dead
And no witnesses in sight
All Bido said is that it happened after midnight
