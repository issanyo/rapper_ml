Hello? Is anybody out there? Can you hear me?
It's about to happen

(chorus) x13
Dr. Wolfgang Von Bushwicken the Bavarian Bill
[Watch me] [Kill]

Straight outta nightmares, somewhere
A rare glimpse of Bushwick
I'm off on some sick shit
My mind still plays tricks
It is I says me, I agree with my inner self
Thinkin' and contemplate on all the pain that my enemies felt
At the hands of this madman
Catscans can't prove that I'm crazy
I wanna chop bodies daily
Oh God save me, Dahmer was a minor case
Get a load of Chuckwick
Eye to eye, face to face
Evil thoughts hit me when I get distraught
Easily hidden, I'm never gettin' fuckin' caught fool
Lucky Chuckie
Trust me in your house and watch
You'll go into shock, chokin' on your blood clot
Don't mind me

And you just try to survive a visit from the

Chorus x8

Haha, horrifyin', part of me's a big man
I went to Cypress Hill they learned how to kill a man
Menace Clan showed me who the devil was

Just because, to show the world I ain't a punk
I got dead bodies rottin' in my Benz trunk
Trunk of funk, call it what you want to
Make sure I'm gone, and not behind you
Because in dreams, I'm breemin' Scotty dead bodies
Don't try to run, you can't escape this (????) dread
Yes I'm dead, and always stay a step ahead
And if I stay behind your ass is mines anyway
Play it wit shark, I like to kick body parts
It's an art, to choppin' up hearts kid
Did what I did because I know in this mind I'm sick
And you just try to survive a visit from the
