[Bushwick Bill]
Hello? Is anybody out there?
Alright, well check it
You've all been cordially invited
And as you can see it's a full house, heh
To Bushwick's house of pain
Now as your game warden, I'm gonna test your skills
Your will to live, and your ability to survive
Let's see what type of technique you can come up with
Everything we fightin for, is a fight to the finish
Only the strong can survive in this game
The winner is the only one alive {*chuckling*}
So uhh, for the rest of your listening pleasure
Sit back, relax, and see if you can endure
The physical torture, of every day life
And let the games begin, the game warden has spoken
Dr. Wolfgang Von Bushwickin the Barbarian Motherfunky Stayhigh Dollar Billstir
You haven't heard? Now you know
Knowin is half the battle
No rules
