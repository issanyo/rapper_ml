[Intro]
Heh, Once again
The other damn level again
Told you I'd be back up at you, part two, uhh
(I can still fuck all my ex girls)
I'm Wolfgang-banging, ah-heh, ah-heh, heh
(I can still fuck all my ex girls)
Them bitches livin true lies
(I can still fuck all my ex... girls)
Peep the deception, ahahahaha
I be breakin 'em off and stickin' them thighs
While you lookin at her eyes, and hearin' nuttin' but lies

[Bushwick Bill]
Now I can still fuck all my ex girls
I can give a fuck if they were Johnny Gill's
Or even Keith Sweat's girls
I can push up on yo' stunt
So you can woo woo, and mao mao, all the fuck you want
Niggas get mad when they see the 'Wick comin'
Just because they bitch used to be my woman, um
And I can't really blame you trick look at you right
Cause I can take your hoe home with me tonight, nigga!
Must be somethin' 'bout the way I used to hit that juice spot
That keep yo' bitch hot, and ridin' on my jock
Cause once I hook her it's on
I'll beat that on the boards, motherfucker yo' hooker's gone
Player don't sweat it ain't shit you can do
I got the comeback stroke an' it's hundred proof
So once I fuck your bitch I'm always in her world
Yeah, the rude boy dread, can fuck all his ex girls!

[Chorus 2x]
(I can still fuck all my ex girls, nigga)
(I can still fuck all my ex girls)

[Bushwick Bill]
(Still fuckin') Now I can still fuck Michelle
Even though 'Chelle's got a nigga named Mel
Now Mel's got it goin' on, worldwide ballin'
But every time Mel's gone, 'Chelle start callin'
Cause 'Chelle know that I'ma tap that ass real good
Mel's out of town, but I'm in the hood
So beep beep beep shit I'm on it, I hate to see her frown
Meet me at the 'tel in a gown
Now Mel's got a gang of hoes so he can't remember
That I'm that nigga made his main bitch shiver
She used to rent me cars, Cadillacs and Cherokees
Even swooped yo' shit, got an extra pair of keys
Niggas be forgettin' about this man, sittin' next to the man
Sittin' next to the ex with the plan, and
That ex man is Muah
The nigga with the excellent repertoire
I can still...

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill - over Chorus]
I don't know the reason why, I should be tellin' you
Quiet as kept, nigga what? (laughing)
So I hear you wanna marry a bitch?
(I can still fuck her)

[Bushwick Bill]
Now I don't give a Fuck, if you went and sprung for a ring
I can make your main bitch sing
So keep her real close, never let her outta sight
The phone ring it's me hangin' up late at night
Just because you won't let her out to club
Don't mean that I still can't get her love
So don't fall for the okey-doke, if you got a hunch
We be at the Motel 6, and your bitch is lickin' nuts
When it come to fuckin' ex hoes I'm the best
So you better keep yo' bitch on house arrest
And don't you ever go to, jail
Cause I bet I'll fuck yo' bitch, before you make bail
Once you get out, check the mileage on your Beemer
And check your credit limit loc I schemed her
I got my whole crew rollin' through yo' world
Cause you got married to my ex girl, trick!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(I can still fuck her)
(I can still fuck all my ex girls)
(I can still fuck her)
