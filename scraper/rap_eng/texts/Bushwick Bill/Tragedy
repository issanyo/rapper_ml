[Bushwick Bill]
Oh shit! Ay {*laughing*}
On a collision course with death, every breath brings me closer to it
Inevitable, the funeral, done deal
Dead issue, old age or if Bushwick twist you
The day's comin, and nothin'll save you
That gun makes you braver but the question is nigga
Will a bulletproof save ya? Drama and your momma can't help it
You can't help yourself
Bleedin on a gurney, wishin that he shot someone else
Now you're hit, drown in your spit, fucked up predicament
The real shit nigga
Bullet holes and pulled triggers equal injured motherfuckers
We all gon' die, but I ain't goin out
All y'all niggas gon' read about a gun battle
Headlines from M-I-A to Seattle
Readin "They killed that nigga, but he took some with him"
Family's grievin wishin they never FUCKED with me~!
Thought my baretta wouldn't let you have it?
IT'S A PART OF LIFE SO WHY IS IT TRAGIC?!
Semi and fully automatics run the streets around here
ADDICTS AND FULL BLOWN AIDS, WATCHIN YO' WEIGHT DISAPPEAR
And crack smoke, nigga it's no joke
IT'S TRAGEDY!!! SECONDS FROM INSANITY
FEEL LIKE A DEMON IS GRABBIN ME TRAGEDY ALL AROUND YOU
Then, the +Mind of a Lunatic+ steps in
This is where your hell begins, it's
TRAGEDY!!! SECONDS FROM INSANITY
FEEL LIKE BUSHWICK IS GRABBIN YOU TRAGEDY ALL AROUND YOU
Then, the +Mind of a Lunatic+ steps in
This is where your hell begins, it's

Comatose due, to a dose of your own medicine
The good that you did in life, now it's irrelevant
Between life, to the right of the light
So serene and pristine look how it glitters and gleams
To the left is true death, pitch black space and time
Reserved for the wicked and those of your kind
Your past time is killin but you ain't willin to die
You don't want have your momma sittin in the church pews and cry
While you live life this trife shit just caught up
You know GOD DAMN WELL it ain't the way that you was brought up
What it all boils when the ending is this
You will do no more wrong nigga but sit in the midst of
TRAGEDY!!! Seconds from insanity
Feel like Bushwick is grabbin you tragedy all arounds you
Then, the mind of Bushwick sets in
This is where your hell begins, nigga, it's
TRAGEDY!!! SECONDS FROM INSANITY
FEEL LIKE THE DEMON IS GRABBIN YOU TRAGEDY ALL AROUNDS YOU
Then, the +Mind of a Lunatic+ steps in
This is where your hell begins

Between your last breath in life and death
The Demon had a gun and crept on ya and shot
Victim of a plot, took your {?} from others
Now your momma'll cry and try to hold on
But the Demon's grip is too strong
How you expect to live? Livin negative
Got your body like this, the holes are massive
YOU'RE PISSIN IN PLASTIC, and don't even know it
Situation get drastic IN THE GHETTO DON'T IT?!
Fight to live all night, but your fate is sealed now
Your faith in God's the only thing that's real
You knew it would end nigga but not like this
Want to die an old man, not caught in my twist
Seekin sympathy near death in a fetal position
Why this world so cold (nigga) they had no pity
And then completed my mission
'Bout to reside on that other side and can't turn back
Cause I have no pity nigga, now your body is trapped in
TRAGEDY!!! Seconds from insanity
Feel like Bushwick is grabbin you tragedy all arounds you
Then, the +Mind of a Lunatic+ sets in
This is where gravity begins, nigga, it's tragedy
