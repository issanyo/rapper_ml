[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill]
Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking, I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I'm wastin'
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Looking through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peeping tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, "If you scream, I'm cuttin'"
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin'
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit when they're fucking with a lunatic

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going for guts
Boys used to die when I'm full of that fry
I be amping when I'm high
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo, get a grip
And bitch, come equipped, ain't taking no shit
Cause here comes a lunatic

[Verse 4: Scarface]
My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out, "Brad!"
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on Brad's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (Freeze, motherfucker!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said, "Die, motherfuckers!" as I blasted
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying, from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A raging psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders was watching; set an example
I popped one, "Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mother fuckers coming with me"
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up in an asylum
Bein treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

[Verse 5: Willie D]
November 1st 1966
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I should of been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behavior
Fuck with me, and I'll slay ya
Ass, beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to Borden
You'll never find a mother fucker, so save your milk cartons
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

[Verse6: Willie D]
I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your motherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold to some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
This is fact, not fictional, son of a bitch
I got the mind of a lunatic
