Feat. Bucket Loc, Pimp Dawg
[Bushwick Bill]
Gangsta funk, on a whole 'nother level
(P-Funk's my shit, so here, run get a shovel right)
Gangsta funk, on a whole 'nother level
(P-Funk's my shit, so here, run get a shovel right)

[Chorus]
Ding-dong, damn, who's at my do'?
(It's my brother Pimp Dawg and he fresh from the liquor sto')
Ding-dong, damn, who's at my do'?
(It's the brother Bucket Loc and he fresh from his latest show)
Ding-dong, damn, who's at my do'?
(It's my brother Pimp Dawg and he fresh from the liquor sto')
Ding-dong, damn, who's at my do'?
(It's the brother Bucket Loc and he fresh from his latest show)

[Pimp Dawg]
Well I'm quick on the draw, and I put that on my pah
I'm takin two to yo' jaw and sittin right on the log
Because it ain't no need for tryin to scatter in a hurry
When my Mac shout, takin them suckers out in a flurry

[Bucket Loc]
Just another skifflin, scandalous past, brother from the clique
That's hanging out up in Old City shit, 'bout to make this pretty trick
My name is B-U-C, how you doin? Fine
Lookin at her thighs I can tell she ain't never lied
And eyes like they're takin me on a +Voyage+, but it ain't +Fantastic+
Unless I'm packin the plastic, elastic
Stretch pants got my hands wantin to rub you
Passin by the bud house, stopped and got me a dub fool - cool~!

[Pimp Dawg]
A fat sack of hydro, plus this fine hoe
I got out and locked the car do', bailed into the corner sto'
Sippin on some Hendo call it the Hennessy
I hit the dank and then the drank and wait for the bus to hit, me
But let's talk about these minute men brothers that say they don't love hoes
Bust a nut and get up, that ain't the way it goes
I'm lickin them hoes elbows and on up to yo' nose
And I guarantee that if you with me you comin up off them clothes

[Bucket Loc]
Froze is how I leave her, a firm disbeliever
That ain't no need to front right pullin them stunts like Cochiba
Deeper, here it come, creeper, ain't it bomb
I'm packin the biggest DEICK, to hit it and leave it sprung, bow down

[Chorus]
