Bushwick Bill:
There was three little piggies and they all went to the market
And two short motherfuckers, hahaha
Chopped them down, because, uh
One little short motherfucker was born into greatness
Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh
Bushwick, A.K.A. Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck

I got the strength of six men
With the heart to run up on a motherfucker six ten
I dare, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet. (Throats get cut)
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true! (that ain't true!)
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no motherfucking strap
We could get it on cause i feel i got a real cool scrap
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfucking mob

(Chorus x2)
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
(CJ) You the biggest, little motherfucker I know
I'm the biggest, little motherfucker you know
(CJ) You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
Now what you do that for?
Now I got to knock your ass out
With the one, two jump to the chin
I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again
That's what you get for trying to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick
I can't stand a motherfucker full of talk
You pull his ho cord and he can't walk the walk
Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble
Thinkin' cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble
I got a punch as big as Streisands nose
Running motherfuckers like some panty hose

Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckers up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

[Hook x2]

Now I'm eeny-meeny-miny-fucking-mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck with Chuck no more
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever since I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smiling
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whining
I told you motherfuckers size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheating bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigger finger
And don't ever fuck with Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucker you know trick

[Hook x2]
