[Bushwick Bill]
It's Bushwick Bill, I be that motherfuckin nigga
Four foot two, a couple of inches and I'm steady gettin bigger
Straight from the motherfuckin G
To the E to the T to the O, you know the spellin ho
I had to come up strong to get where I'm at
Moved by myself, I had nobody to watch my back
Back in the day I used to play with Tonka toys
Now I'm paid and shootin dice with the big boys
Shoot a G, bet a G, now watch me hit a lick
I ain't worryin about no shit because I packed my shit
I pull my shit and take a shit cause that's the way I do it
And when it comes to handlin shit, there ain't nothin to it
Bushwick Bill, the motherfuckin thinkin nigga
Gotta stay smart, to keep me from sinkin nigga
Cause if you sleep, you'll get beat, on the street
Understand, get it that's the plan, from the Little Big Man

(Yeah.. hahhh.. come again!  Uh, yeah..)
(Peep game)

[Bushwick Bill]
Now when it comes to bitches I play games with they minds
Cause once you get that head, you gon' get the pussy any time
And it's a proven fact
I'm hittin bitches from the back, Bushwick Bill
Neighborhood - mack
In and out the crib like a motel
Fucked her so well, the ho had to go tell
Her friend and then I fucked her too
Got 'em both claimin that they in love wit you know who
Now what am I to do, but pass her to the crew
And let the fellas get that ass and bust a couple of nuts or two
Cause that's the way we do it, fella
The Little Big Man, takin bitches to that other level!

(Yeah.. uh, uh, uh, ahh)

[Bushwick Bill]
How many motherfuckers wanna test the
B-U-S-H-W-I-C-K, blowin niggas away, clickin every day
Cuttin niggas up, into Kibbles 'N Bits and shit
Gougin out your fuckin eyeballs and then I skullfuck you, bitch
Hey nigga, don't you know, today's the first day
In the last moments of your life, run and tell your fuckin wife
Little nigga, little nigga, pullin trigger, gettin bigger
Gravedigger bury nigga like me how the fuck you figure
There's nothin worse than bein, caught up in a gridlock
With a fuckin dreadlock, cause you know I bust shot
Notty dred, notty dred, come slave driver
Buck 'em dead, buck 'em dead, Bushwick gettin liver
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, BUCK, watch dem fall fast
Little Big Man, buck buck, bustin 'nuff ass!
