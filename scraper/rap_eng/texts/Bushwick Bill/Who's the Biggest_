[Intro]
There was three little piggies and they all went to the market
And two short motherfuckas, hahaha
Chopped them down, because, uh
One little short motherfucka was born into greatness
Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh

Bushwick, aka Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck
I got the strength of six men
With the heart to run up on a muthafucka six ten
I swear, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no muthafuckin strap
We could get it on cause I feel I got a (?????)
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfuckin mob

Chorus X3
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
You the biggest, little motherfucka I know

I'm the biggest, little motherfucka you know
You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
[Now what you do that for?]
Now I got to knock your ass out
With the one, two jump to the chin
I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again
That's what you get for tryin to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick
I can't stand a muthafucka fulla talk
You pull his ho cord and he can't walk the walk
Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble
Thinkin' cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble
I got a punch as big as Streisands nose
Running motherfuckas like some panty hose
Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckas up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

Chorus X4

Now I'm eeny meeny miny fuckin mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck wit Chuck NO MOE!
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever sonce I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smilin
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whinin
I told you motherfuckas size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheatin bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigga finger
And don't ever fuck wit Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucka you know trick

Chorus X4
