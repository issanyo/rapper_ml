Lyrics from a snippet

[Intro]
No cap, no cap, no cap, no cap, no cap (yeaah)

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
I don't fuck with them niggas 'cause they so iffy iffy
Don't get caught up in situations so sticky sticky
All alone out in traffic I keep my blicky blicky
(Yeahhh) Ride with my lil icky vicky
Tryna elevate, yeah I like a hippy hippy
Hi that bitch from the back and then I dippy dippy
All I need is two cups and then I sippy sippy
I'm feeling loose today, trynna get trippy trippy

[Verse 1 : Trippie Redd]
I'm moon-walking in Channel
I got to hold for myself I can't go to jail
They tryna lock me away, n give no bail
And if the day come, that imma give 'em he'll (yeah)
Just know imma stay silent I ain't never gon' tell (yeah)
You tryna stop me you gon F.A.I.L
Fear god on my body but I ain't scared to go to hell
I ain't do nothing wrong so imma let that shit prevail

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
I don't fuck with them niggas 'cause they so iffy iffy
Don't get caught up in situations so sticky sticky
All alone out in traffic I keep my blicky blicky
(Yeahhh) Ride with my lil icky vicky
Tryna elevate, yeah I like a hippy hippy
Hi that bitch from the back and then I dippy dippy
All I need is two cups and then I sippy sippy
I'm feeling loose today, trynna get trippy trippy

[Verse 2 : Rich the Kid]
Foreign bitch I make her licky licky
Popped a perc Iâ€™m gettin sippy sippy
I got my lil bitch Chanel you thought I was trippin
She fucked the whole team why you thought she was different

[Chorus : Trippie Redd]
I don't fuck with them niggas 'cause they so iffy iffy
Don't get caught up in situations so sticky sticky
All alone out in traffic I keep my blicky blicky
(Yeahhh) Ride with my lil icky vicky
Tryna elevate, yeah I like a hippy hippy
Hi that bitch from the back and then I dippy dippy
All I need is two cups and then I sippy sippy
I'm feeling loose today, trynna get trippy trippy
