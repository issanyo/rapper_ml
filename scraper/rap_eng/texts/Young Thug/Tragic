[Intro]
Uh, uh.. yeah, yeah, yeah
London on the track bitch!
Hahahahaha!
Aye this the truth
Dolly
London on the track bitch!

[Hook]
(What you got?)
Got London on da track bitch
(London)
Hell yeah, I'm a savage
Pussy wet, fuck a pad you need some napkins
Hit the club, get some ones, and make it tragic
I'mma make it rain inside the club
I'mma pop some bottles, make her bub
Homie I'm not looking at her, baby I do it just like I does

[Verse: 1]
I just do my thang in these streets, yah!
I'm the biggest, toughest wildebeest
All these starving niggas didn't come with a feast, yah!
I'mma put a super charge in a caprice, yea!
If you really havin' birds, lemme see yea!
I just got a new iPhone and I ain't sync it
So I might don't got your number
If a nigga play, I might turn it like  I channel
Caught me banging with a red bandana
Not no February scary bandana
Yeah! don't get the scary bandana
I just might blow on that ho, no candle
No clothes baby that's my standards
Jamaicans smoking on cabana
Purp make me forgot I'm not having stamina
Every Tuesday, I throw racks at amateurs

[Hook]
(What you got?)
Got London on da track bitch
(London)
Hell yeah, I'm a savage
Pussy wet, fuck a pad you need some napkins
Hit the club, get some ones, and make it tragic
I'mma make it rain inside the club
I'mma pop some bottles, make her bub
Homie I'm not looking at her, baby I do it just like I does

[Verse 2]
Shoot a nigga down tragic, hold you number tragic
Your momma a tragic, your daddy a tragic
I pull up and trash shit, the whole bitty bastards
All my crew like trashing, let them have it
Wet his face no baptist, Lil' boy Larry
Sit your little ass down like I used magic
I got more wood than a fucking palace
Dolly White told to me sit back, just point and laugh at
These niggas and these bum bitches
Porn bitches nigga come and get it
Nigga if I make it rain, let these bitches get it
I just want a long neck like a chicken, get it?
Every YSL member get it
I left weed in my fender, get it
Bring a tender, you a member get it
No puppet, no pretending I'mma fuckin menace

[Hook]
(What you got?)
Got London on da track bitch
(London)
Hell yeah, I'm a savage
Pussy wet, fuck a pad you need some napkins
Hit the club, get some ones, and make it tragic
I'mma make it rain inside the club
I'mma pop some bottles, make her bub
Homie I'm not looking at her, baby I do it just like I does
