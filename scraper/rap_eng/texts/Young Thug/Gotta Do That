Hop up out the coupe, hop up out my shoes ,hop inside your boo
Hop up out the Rover, hop up out the Rollie, hop inside the shawty

No, yeah you don't gotta do that, (aye)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Lotion down
Round two and then
Beat her down, she's the way she never did
Beast Mode, like i'm from Seatle bitch
The case closed, I just dodged a big old bitch
Ridin' with your baby bro
Stay down with your baby bro
Ridin' with your baby bro
Stay down with your baby bro
Ride for the case, you know
Too fine for the place, she know
You fine and you blaze, you know
You ridin' with a case, you know
Ridin with a case, you know
Die by the case, you know
Multiply by the case, you know
Beat the Kevin pop a case, you know
Put the bitches in your face, you know
Like a nigga sprayed mace, you know
Diamonds hit you in your face, you know
Like a nigga sprayed mace, you know

[Chorus]
And i'm like help me (aye)
Every time I wanna see it
Best believe she let me see it (aye)
Every time I wanna be slick
She said you ain't gotta do that do that
You, you ain't gotta do that do that
No, you ain't gotta do that
No, yeah you don't gotta do that, aye
