I stacked it up and keep my cash up

I'ma pop the seal and pour the Act up
Nigga Gang banging nigga flagged up

Excuse my french, but you can’t find a bitch we ain't bagged up
Negative 4 Degrees, Negative 4 Degrees

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Nigga bracked up, nigga stacked up
Nigga acting tough, but ain't bad as us
Got a bad bitch she don’t like you
But I’m too rich for her so I backed doored her
I saw my name on a Coke-Cola, it said Jeff, shoulda said Thugga
They say me and my cup is the best couple
Cause I drink it for breakfast, lunch, and supper
I made a million and they pocket wide
I made the money then they switching sides
I knocked em off and didn’t hide
I'm not a fuck nigga, didn't go to the other side
Bitch I’m still here, my momma told me slow it down
I just poured up a four in a beer
And, If I pull up my sleeves it's Negative 4 Degrees

[Verse 2: Shad Da God]
Talk to me just like a tender
The bent coupe match the sprinter
We on Actavis Dinner,  on Actavis Dinner, on Actavis Dinner
Triple seal on the binack
Blue stripes on the cinat
Roll us some grizzam with finam (aaah)
I got that M with the Kizzam
Hold up, first you gone smash her, then you gone hit it
Got a bitch I peeped you for you, popped digits
I fuck her, hold on the end though
That be the extendo, 33 pull up get endo

[Verse 3: Duke]
YSL Shit, Diamonds on Negative 4 Degrees
Florida water got these hoes on they knees
Dive through the body, cologne is by creed
My bitch need a translator she cannot speak
Chris with the rock and the way with it
This is not church but I'm praising this bitch
Burning rubber I pull of in the street
Popping these percs and I’m bout to OD
Bad little bitch with me but she low-key
They know my name and I run with OG's
Niggas snitching we call them slowly
Rolling up backwood we smoke out the P (roll em up)
We fly and we fucking up g’s (ellionte)
Run it up I want a spot in Belize
Niggas is ratting like mice for the cheese
20k got my Apple Watch on freeze
I think its like
