[Intro]
Playmakers
Run that back Turbo

[Chorus: Gunna]
Two door Maybach, back to back
Four door Maybach black on black
Lifestyle high maintenance, oil change cost a couple racks
Fuck these ho, can't get attached
Condo got a touchscreen pack
High-Tech, red addict
Act on Act, Act on my back

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Money my motherfucking bag
Money on my motherfucking back
I was drinkin' Actavis and nothing else, yeah I was drinkin' Act on Act
I was just was dancing with the devil in the back
I was just was dancing with him jack
I just took a Percocet bigger than a marshmallow
Then I went playing in the cat
I just went karats on karats on karats, I just went Roger Rabbit
I didn't use a rubber, I went in bare, yeah I'm back at it
Made these bitches stop and stare at the craft jacket
I had sixteen plaques like Mad Max

[Chorus: Gunna]
Two door Maybach, back to back
Four door Maybach black on black
Lifestyle high maintenance, oil change cost a couple racks
Fuck these ho, can't get attached
Condo got a touchscreen pack
High-Tech, red addict
Act on Act, Act on my back

[Verse 2: Cheat Code]
I was looking for the addy (who got addy?)
I was focused, tryna open this strip, no active
Thugger told me teach you stick, pour deuce you ratchet
Bitch I got lions, no tellin', bleu cheese, no salad
These here baguettes, ain't gotta wash these, L-V, look plastic
Like voodoo I'm free savvy
Act on my back, back to back Maybach, pass it
I got reach, I stretch out and touch you, I'm elastic
And y'all ain't eatin', y'all niggas snacking
So you gon' be hungry again, I got it on me again
Drop top back like a boiling pan
On perc, fuck her over and over again
This plain Roley a ten
That's my ex-bitch in that Benz
Let her drive and go fuck on her friend
I said that ass look like it gin
That Bentley tail fish with the fin, yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
Two door Maybach, back to back
Four door Maybach black on black
Lifestyle high maintenance, oil change cost a couple racks
Fuck these ho, can't get attached
Condo got a touchscreen pack
High-Tech, red addict
Act on Act, Act on my back
