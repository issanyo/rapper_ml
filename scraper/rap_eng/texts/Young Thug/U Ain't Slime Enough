[Chorus: Young Thug]
I slime you out, so I have you on this wing jet
I slime you out, and split it with the team, yeah
I slime you out, we pull up with the sting, yeah
I slime you out, they caught it with a machine, yeah
I slime you out, I slime you motherfuckers out
I slime you out, we comin' burnin' up your house
I slime you out, you can see it in my eyes
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Karlae & Young Thug]
Outside lookin' in, there is no comparison (mh-mhm)
You put them bitches in a line and I'll embarrass them (mhm)
Magnificently written, all this shit that I be kickin' (mhm)
Ain't no queens of the jungle, really all these bitches kittens (meow)
Who they kiddin', they be smitten
Tell 'em bye and then good riddance (good riddance!)
And they freestyles by? I can tell that shit good written (Slime, slatt slatt!)
Excuse me!
See we different, everybody out here braggin' 'bout their dough
But when it's time to spend that money, where that bread go? (mhm)
I beat that shit like congo, I pass hoes Rondo (slatt)
If I go inside that Louis purse, run hoe
Rousey I kick shit, with thousands money pilin' up (slatt slatt slatt slatt)
Y'all be on that internet, but money is not dialin' up (slatt slatt slatt slatt)
Your wild dreams ain't wild enough, so what you come at me for? (slatt slatt slatt slatt)
I'll invade your lane, I suggest you take a detour (woo, woo!)
And please check the decor, and y'all drinkin', we pour (Hey! Hey!)
Never say that we poor, y'all can act an ass
Bitch, I'm goin' Eeyore, is it just me or... these hoes need to level up? (Level up, bitch!)
Just bought a green Birkin, call her 7-Up (slimey!)
Your reel isn't real enough, so tell me what you fishin' for

[Refrain: Karlae & Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah these bitches ain't slime enough (mhm)
Yeah (slatt slatt) yeah these niggas not slime enough (slimey)
Yeah (slatt slatt) yeah these bitches ain't slime enough (mhm)
Yeah (slatt slatt) yeah these niggas not slime enough (slimey)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I slime you out, so I have you on this wing jet

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I scream, "Slime, slime, slime," they come in a rush (slatt slatt slatt)
I got snakes tatted on me and my chains to my nuts  (slatt slatt slatt)
I slimed out my grandma (slatt slatt slatt)
Diamonds on my Cartiers, I see farther than Farrakhan (woo)
I know niggas gettin' extorted, like the common cold (ooo, yeah)
I done ate cereal out a plate, I done ate cereal out a bowl (ooo, yeah)
Niggas ain't slimey enough, niggas ain't grimy enough (ooo, yeah)
I got black diamonds like my grandpa snuff
Way more money than you, ain't no sympathy, no (ooo, yeah)
Niggas'll wipe your nose like you're sick, you know? (ooo, yeah)
All my niggas shoot first like a damn intro (ooo, yeah)
I get boxes of dough, Kimbo
You a slimey motherfucker Karlae, tell 'em the truth  (slime x9)
You'll catch a body for me, motherfucker, tell 'em the truth (slime x9)
All of these thotties 'bout to think I'm super slimey for you (slime x9)
But you the hottest you lil motherfucka, that's my boo, yeah (slime x9)

[Refrain: Karlae]
Yeah, yeah these bitches ain't slime enough (mhm)
Yeah, yeah these niggas not slime enough (slimey)
Yeah, yeah these bitches ain't slime enough (mhm)
Yeah, yeah these niggas not slime enough (slimey)

[Verse 3: Duke]
I'll slime you out (slime you out)
All these other bitches thirsty, they want clout (they want clout)
Dick in her mouth (dick in your mouth)
I'm on her hip like a pouch (pouch)
She like when I'm beat her down (down)
Name ringin' bells in the town (brrt)
I was just servin' them ounces (ounces)
Now we poppin' them bottles
We all in the VIP and we standin' on couches (couches)
Surrounded by nothin' but vultures (vultures)
I gotta keep it in motion (motion)
You see me, you know that I'm totin' (totin')
Playin' 'bout none of my bros
And if I see you, I'm wipin' your nose

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I slime you out, so I have you on this wing jet
I slime you out, and split it with the team, yeah
I slime you out, we pull up with the sting, yeah
I slime you out, they caught it with a machine, yeah
I slime you out, I slime you motherfuckers out
I slime you out, we comin' burnin' up your house
I slime you out, you can see it in my eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
