[Hook: Young Thug]
Hunnid' bands, hunnid' bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it man
Pop me a Xannie I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic man
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True religion, Buddha man
My money stack tall as Ludacris afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that
I just hit for 9 birds, what I'ma do with that?
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh you so through with that
If you are a nerd, everything here you not cool with that

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Yes you not cool, no you not bool
I don't give no damn I'm not calling you boo
My bitch she a jewel
You can't prove a point, boy you know you so doomed
You know you so doomed
I swear I'm so lost with no clue, don't know what to do
Over loud, over loud
I over loud on these niggas
Ain't know how to milk these cows
She made that dick grow now it's big like a tower
Yaow, front pockets filled up with bands, no Bible

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Pull up, hop out the block
They tuck in they tail, I go "who the clan?"
Dressed in all black, I'm always on the road, just like a Uber man
We wrappin' and sendin' them packs
Soon as they land we movin' em
Blame it on the OG's, they influenced me (I'm riding with felons)
Ain't gonna count money nigga, I ain’t juh met money, nigga
I put lipstick on the 'rari, she say that's delicious
Who that is in that Crown Vic, he look suspicious (Shhh)
I just jugged 100 pounds, I made a...
