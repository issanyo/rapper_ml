[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Uh
Wheezy beats
This money turnin' me on
(Yo, turn me up bro)
Misery, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
This money turnin' me on, ayy, this money turnin' me on
I'm thinkin' out loud, but these hunnids got a nigga gone (woo)
Three hundred racks for a Bentley truck, yeah yeah
Take the factories off and go and lift it up, yeah yeah
Cash all on your bitch, she on the living room floor
Having a private party, you know how it go

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Music all in my ears
Instruments in my ears
I'm in the backyard feeding deers
I'm in a condo popping seals
I got po-po's in my rear
I bought CoCo with my deal
I missed a couple shows with my deal
If I could take it back I will
And don't you take that to the head
You know I got you in my whip
It don't matter if it don't work out
Man I know you with me for real
You helped me balance my skills
You helped me over the hill
You got my mind right when I was thinking 'bout going and go kill
Young lil' nigga popping shit
High school, I played quarterback
I ain't never had to hit a lick
Never had to touch a nick
Never had to risk shit
But this wealth, cause if you played then it's death

[Chorus: Young Thug]
This money turnin' me on, ayy, this money turnin' me on
I'm thinkin' out loud, but these hunnids got a nigga gone (far gone)
Three hundred racks for a Bentley truck, yeah yeah
Take the factories off and go and lift it up, yeah yeah
Cash all on your bitch, she on the living room floor
Having a private party, you know how it go

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hunnid fifty thousand for a show
On the east or the west coast
Give a couple bands to the woa
Jet to Miami with some zoes
Hunnid fifty thousand for a show
Hunnid fifty thousand for a show
On the east or the west coast
On the east or the west coast, ayy
Every night I snuck my way outside
Started skipping school and I snuck up on a ride
My brother in law let me shoot a choppa when I was five
Ever since that day, man I been riding 'til I die

[Chorus: Young Thug]
This money turnin' me on, ayy, this money turnin' me on
I'm thinkin' out loud, but these hunnids got a nigga gone (far gone)
Three hundred racks for a Bentley truck, yeah yeah
Take the factories off and go and lift it up, yeah yeah
Cash all on your bitch, she on the living room floor
Having a private party, you know how it go
