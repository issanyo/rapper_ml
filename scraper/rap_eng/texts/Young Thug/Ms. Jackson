[Chorus]
Lil mama
She flooded with carrots just like a rabbit
I know I
Caught her slipping baby girl is not average
I know I
Got a lil taste cause my bitch is the baddest
I'm 'bout to touch it cause its so fat and plus I found out its Ms Jackson
Ms.Jackson [x7]
Yeah thats Ms.Jackson
I can't believe my face
She the baddest one in this place. (aye aye)

[Verse]
Baddest bitch in the building
Throwing ones to the ceiling
Bentley coupe no ceiling
Aye baby no remy
She ain't poppin that pussy
Chain cost me that fifty
This bitch love touching
Smelling good all my hoes

Back in the day we bowled
Big boxers Girbauds

Dabbing in a nigga hoe
Whoa-oh-whoa-oh
