[Hook: Young Thug]
She just wanna get this paper
Yeah, stay away from all of these haters
I'ma run it up to the sky like a skyscraper
Drinkin' purple and yellow, feelin' like a Laker
Thugger Thugger, OG Boo Dirty, we a Laker
Yeah I wanna know, we are a Laker
Fuckin' bitches, fuckin' bitches like we a Laker
Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker
I'm a Laker, Laker, Laker, yeah I'm a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
She cummin' twice like a Laker, bought a hundred acres like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team

[Verse 1: OG Boo Dirty]
Aye Thugger Thugger roll up while I pour up the jelly
Sauced up like spaghetti, my bitch fine as Halle Berry
I hit it, stick it, stab it just like I was Freddy
And make that pussy sing to me... R Kelly
You niggas funnier than Jim Carrey
While I'm grindin' for my nicks, call me Raymond Felton
Drop a juice and get a quarter back like Jim Kelly
Choppers with machetes, I don't think you ready
My sack loud, you can't even turn it down
Smokin' out the pound while your bitch goin' down
My goons move in silence, they won't make a sound
We starvin' for the paper, fuck nigga we gettin' pounds

[Hook: Young Thug]
She just wanna get this paper
Yeah, stay away from all of these haters
I'ma run it up to the sky like a skyscraper
Drinkin' purple and yellow, feelin' like a Laker
Thugger Thugger, OG Boo Dirty, we a Laker
Yeah I wanna know, we are a Laker
Fuckin' bitches, fuckin' bitches like we a Laker
Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker
I'm a Laker, Laker, Laker, yeah I'm a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
She cummin' twice like a Laker, bought a hundred acres like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team

[Verse 2: King Myers]
I'm livin' life just like a Laker
I be smokin' purple, drinkin' yellow Fanta
And I don't drink no Actavis
But I'm active when I'm in the Panamera
My niggas leanin', your niggas dreamin'
We Lakers, we got bitches screamin'
And all of 'em bad, none of 'em decent
When you think of the Lakers, you think of Kobe
So my niggas got 2 guns for the niggas that owe me
I far fetch
Schoolin' these niggas, give 'em Artest, now they want beef
Plenty women in the sea, like Derek, I fish when I need
I'm just tryna eat that whole meal, I'm grindin' for my own deal
We don't just get on the board, we break the board like O'Neal
I started trappin', but better at rappin'
All I had to do was make it happen, got sick of the Magic
And shout out to Jamal for the trap, you can't finesse a finesser
Gave you six racks, you should go buy your girl a real necklace
I could have fucked her, cause I'm ballin' like a Laker
I'm after this Kareem, ain't got no time for these haters

Fuckin' bitches, fuckin' bitches like we a Laker
[Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker]
I'm a Laker, Laker, Laker, yeah I'm a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
She cummin' twice like a Laker, bought a hundred acres like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team
