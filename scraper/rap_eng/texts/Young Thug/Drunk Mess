[Chorus: Kooly Bros]
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex
I'm a drunk fest, get your drunk sex
Pour it to the top, pour a little more
I can barely walk, I just want some more
I'm a drunk fest, get your drunk sex
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex

[Verse 1: Kooly Bros]
She just fell a vic' to the style (to the style)
I'm a mess, cup spilling, getting wild (wild)

Ooh, I could smash it all night yeah
Oh I could take your hoe, I know
Don't you know we on live (true story)
I'm the one you want again

I'm a drunk fest, get your drunk sex
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
All type of drugs
Percocet

Call a nigga SEX, call a nigga SEX (SEX, SEX)
Three-wheeler T-REX, I'm boarding a jet (skrt, skrt)
SEX playing with a check, who told you that?
Give you drunk sex, give you drunk sex (yeah)
Bang on your neck like a drum set (yeah)
Deep-throat her, where her tonsils at (where your tonsils)
Shorty got good hair like a bunny (ay)

[Verse 3: Kooly Bros]
I just had like 6 shots (shoot 'em up)

Buckhead with my teammate
Baby girl I'm eating like that, you won't go back, kitty
Fucking with the Kooly, you gon' lose your breath
Yeah I brought the tooly, shoot it on your breast (boom, boom)
Fucking with the best, I confess I'm blessed
We at the club that we wreck, I got a mess on your dress

[Hook: Kooly Bros]

I'm the one you can't let go

[Chorus: Kooly Bros]
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex
I'm a drunk mess, give you drunk sex

Pour it to the top, pour a little more
