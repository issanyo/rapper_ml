[Hook]
My whole life I liked to gang bang
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me stack these chips like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke, this drink I drink's no joke
Youn-Young Thug ain't no joke, my old lady ain't no joke
YSL's ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke, no joke, no joke, no joke, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Verse 1]
Hey, you got them racks, Young Thugga there
Plus I got more power than a damn electric chair
Looked her in her eyes and now she clashin' our dope here
I'm gettin' stoned, that's (?) wearin' summer gear
Shoot his ass in the face, leave his ass by the lake, no trace, no case
Got a band right below my waist
You can touch like a board, I ain't hit a sweepstakes though
After all them eats, better eat off my plate, pasos by the caseload
Call Rich Homie, he got you, Mexico with Maceo
Alright, I'm ridin' 'round town, and put my hands down
If that's a nigga from your crew then put his hands down
Better watch his ass, better watch his ass
Cause if you let this shit pass, your career ain't gon' last

My whole life I like gang bang

This drink I drink's no joke
Youn-Young Thug ain't no joke
My old lady ain't no joke
YSL's ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke
No joke, no joke, no joke, I swear

[Verse 2]
Fuck all y'all niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck my bitch, cause I'm down with these bitches
I'm gettin' 'round with these bitches
I'm down for my nigga, aye
My ice like a cooler, I got on a Franck Muller
Act tough and I'll shoot ya, point at Chris no Luda
Trunk of my car look like a Buddha
Catch ya bitch and recruit her
Brush ya hair for oodles and noodles
Like Shawty Lo, I'm foolish
Got her turnt down like she work at Hooters
Got her red like Freddie Krueger
Open the door for my shawty
Gas tank on E no 40
AP look kinda sporty, sheesh
