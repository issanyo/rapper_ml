[Chorus: B.o.B & (Young Thug)]
Feelin' xantastic
Weavin' through traffic (weave)
Girl, next to me nasty (weave)
Fine as all get out (weave)
I reckon she the baddest (bad)
She be too attached to me (attached)
Might pull out the Aston (Aston)
Make 'em all sit up (weave)
They say we too flashy (weave)
All designer fashion (weave)
We ain't never had shit (weave)
That's why we gotta put on (weave)
Diamonds on me spazzin' (weave)
Keepin' this passion (weave)
In case you was askin' (weave)
Get down for the get down

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Snortin' cocaine while you're yawning
Do everythin' under the sun (doin' everything)
Shootin' dice until the morning
Like a phone, if you not rock star, you boring (ring)
Piccadilly, wrists spilled me, Richard Mille
On they wish list, and they riches, really, really
Cocaine like a mob boss, taller than my ceiling
I can spark a world war, bring me back your kiddy
I can be your ring tone
I'm flyin' to the clouds, yeah
And no I ain't comin' down, yeah
My mama moved my round, yeah
Cloud 9, ninth round, yeah
Repeat my sound, yeah
Repeat my sound, yeah

[Chorus: B.o.B & (Young Thug)]
Feelin' xantastic
Weavin' through traffic (weave)
Girl, next to me nasty (weave)
Fine as all get out (weave)
I reckon she the baddest (bad)
She be too attached to me (attached)
Might pull out the Aston (Aston)
Make 'em all sit up (weave)
They say we too flashy (weave)
All designer fashion (weave)
We ain't never had shit (weave)
That's why we gotta put on (weave)
Diamonds on me spazzin' (weave)
Keepin' this passion (weave)
In case you was askin' (weave)
Get down for the get down


[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I'm walkin' sleep but still awake
I honestly can't feel my face, no
She askin' me am I okay
I shoot a wink and take a drink, yo, yo, yeah
What, you don't want me to party? (What don't you want?)
What, you gon' want me to molly?
You want me stuck in apartment?
Family feud with Steve Harvey
See out the bullet in Charlotte
They showin' ass and titties
What you want me to pretend
Like all of this don't exist?
All of these Xans, they hit (they hit)
All of this cannabis
Twist every chance I get (I get)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I keep sayin' I'ma quit (yeah)
Keep sayin' I'ma quit (yeah)
But every day I contradict
Ain't that a bitch?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: B.o.B & (Young Thug)]
Feelin' xantastic
Weavin' through traffic (weave)
Girl, next to me nasty (weave)
Fine as all get out (weave)
I reckon she the baddest (bad)
She be too attached to me (attached)
Might pull out the Aston (Aston)
Make 'em all sit up (weave)
They say we too flashy (weave)
All designer fashion (weave)
We ain't never had shit (weave)
That's why we gotta put on (weave)
Diamonds on me spazzin' (weave)
Keepin' this passion (weave)
In case you was askin' (weave)
Get down for the get down
