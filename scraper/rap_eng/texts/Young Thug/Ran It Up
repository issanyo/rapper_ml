[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Your main bitch the one you hate

Give a fuck about magazines, pistol came with magazines
They hating’ on me I don’t care, Fendi socks and underwear
In love with the man in the mirror
Hold up ran up a sack then brought it to the trap
We forever on the map
Breaking my wrist bring it back
The Mazi paint it matte black

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I put more rings in my fingers

Walkin’ in trap with my banger
A mansion I don’t got no neighbors
Pocket stuff got a check just to fuck it up
Ran it up they been hatin’ I don’t give a fuck
