[Bridge:]
Hey, hey
Bitch I got nuts like a cantaloupe, I have a problem with hunting hoes
I been a threat since a juvenile, I feel like I'm from the Cali-o
I think her diamonds are yellow so I ride her banana boat
(Banana, banana boat)
I just might buy her some Mentos, yea, right after she SANDOS

[Hook:]
(Hell is you doin'?)
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge:]

[Verse 1:]
Niggas stay high like a balcony
The fact that I'm hot got her after me
Nigga could hit on a second date
Now the bitch call me your majesty
That bitch call me master
Bitch eatin good, gettin' fatter
Bitch you can't see her, she Casper
I tackled ya, sacked ya, Brian Urlachered ya
I ain't a fool nigga plan on gettin' killed
I ain't fuckin' her with (?)
(?) deal
Then I look into their faces and see nothin' but guilt
I know that you wishing you were here
I know that you wishing you were here
Nigga going so fast I can see him in the rear
Throw the pussy for the homie, no sweat, no tears

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I like to take their virginity then let them handle the bums
I like the fact that she young, I like to fuck her colon
She like to keep the cat warm, all her panties made of yarn
These niggas living like James, jiminiy hoes got a gun
I get my Active from shitty, that he get nothing pour with it
I don't know why, anything to get them digits
I shoot the cop, leave em frigid
I don't know why, running straight through the city
I don't know why, next thing you know no more whip
I don't know why, nigga get showed through the mother
East coast, west coast, through the mother
Nigga get high by the feds, living that YSL lifestyle
Every time she give me head, I swear she knock my little lights out
She like help me make the bed, girl I'm an entrepreneur
I look at it first, and then I pursue it, and then I do it
And I swear it feels amazing every single time
And I swear it feels amazing every single time
God, it feels amazing every single time

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
And I swear I do not know why
And I swear I do not know why
I really do not know why
