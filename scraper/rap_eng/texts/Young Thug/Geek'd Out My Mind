[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (I'm geek'd up)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (Ooh, I'm so high)
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you (Thugger!)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She text me one word (What's that?) "Pipe"
She get me out of there, her name under night night
She like, "How the hell you honor roll every time?"
Nigga, sprite dirty, red YSL wine
If you get stoned, you my kind
I might eat it on that loud
That lil bitch got some good head on her shoulders
Young Thugger wish she could rewind
I love getting high with my siblings
I ain't casino, but I'm killin' it
Two hundred bands, got me fishin' it
Bands on the steak, got 'em listenin'

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you

[Verse 2: Code G]
Back to back, we're smoking on repeat
Rolling baseball bat blunts full of trees
Hit it one time, I don't run, I'm geek'd
I only hit the chick one time, she sleep
Came in this bih with the nine in my jeans
I grind in the streets like I grind up the weed
Blunts stay stuffed like my pockets full of green
Take a bad ass bitch and pass her 'round through the team
Molly in her system and it's workin'
Money on the floor, got her twerkin'
Missed calls in my phone, about ten times
I been geek'd out my mind, straight lurkin'
She burpin' and I'm from the gutter
It's worth it, but I never love her
I only wanna bust, no shutter
Find me geek'd up, Code G and Young Thugger (Hey, geekin')

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (I'm geek'd up)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (Ooh, I'm so high)
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you (Take off)

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Thugger geeky geeky, rats inside my trap
Cricket like the demon, knowing that everything ours
Not washing dishes, get out of the kitchen
And brrr, them birds take a shower
Racks that don't like me just (What?)
The weed I smoke sour and louder
Two new panoramic twin towers
You high, I'm not asking who you are to me
Golden [?] my feet
YSL [?]
Run down my bands, now it's harder to reach
All I'm saying is I done ran down my bands so it's harder to reach

[Hook: Code G & Young Thug]
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (YSL stoners)
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high (I'm so high)
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I swear I'm flying like them eagles
I'm so high above the clouds, I can't see you (I'm geek'd up)
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (I'm so high)
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (Ooh, I'm so high)
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind
Geek'd out my mind, geek'd out my mind (Stoner, stoner, Thugger)
