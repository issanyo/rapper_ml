[Hook: Young Thug]
I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can’t beat me with that wooly, they gon swear it’s a problem
I’m gon slide down your hood when you and your girl having problems
OG bag ‘pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Imma wrap my money it look like Oprah Winfrey
Imma sell one of my mansions, everything new but the kitchen
Ain’t no cypher, nor no wrestler, but a rapping invention
And I'm master selling them P’s, now my money no limit
I got my bread up! No, shut up! Don’t let up! No police, I’m fed up!
They cannot forget us, I got your schedule, I fuck up your schedule
I shoot at your head, your dreads, they dye us
These bitches just know it’s too hard to get by us
I’m not advertising but boy you can try us
I sang to your bitch and she call me Mariah
I see and read everything round me but bibles
Bugatti I swear, I’m not gonna hurt anybody
I swear I’m not gonna tell anybody
Just take this molly and stand right beside me
I’m with PeeWee Longway
You know every day a long day
You know I’m not Kanye, but I been rocking since the first day

I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems

Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can’t see me with that wooly, they gon swear it’s a problem
I’m gon slide down your hood when you and your girl having problems
OG bag ‘pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pull up in that new coupe then drop the roof
Take your boo and then tend to her like a boo
She love my dirty drawers even though I'm a crew
I love her even though I know lil' mama's swoo
Cop a Rollie then I Kawasaki ride a bike
Keep a pint, I'mma throw you my bro he white, he white
You not on my level, cause I, I done got my straddles up
Woke up with a nice, bad bitch inside my bed like fuck
Aye I'mma trip across and stick 'em up, don't play
