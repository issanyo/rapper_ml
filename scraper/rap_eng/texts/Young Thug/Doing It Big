[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Thugga!
Wheezy Beats
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Slatt

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over quarter million
It cost me like 260, I eat with the 5 stars
That perc got a nigga high, right now I'm a fly star
You can get popped with the twelve gauge
Don't let a cop get a shell case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace
Bitch, I'm so high as the nosebleed
Lil bitch got a booty like Rakishi
Lil bitch looking hot as a Taki
Beat all these boys like I'm Rocky

[Verse 1]
Bitch I got green like a lobster
Fuck all these hoes like a pornstar
My momma she said I'm a born star
We got that stuff white like a corn starch
I tatted my body like king toes
We let that shit fly like flamingo
That bitch done lucked up like a bingo
I think that I'm Future, the peacoat
I told her come get some these cash baby
I know that you heard by these last baby
You going against me you gon cry baby
You going against us it won't last baby
We sit back, get geeked and just laugh baby
We ball like we play with the Cavs baby
Lil momma she's tall, she a stall' yeah, yeah
Her dirt in the bike like a falcon
Penny loafers with alot of told you birds like Robbins
Come here down bleeding on that Texas floor just choppin'
Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash never stoppin'
Pull up in a dash nigga splash in the choppa
Baby I know you gon tell if I smoke em
Meanwhile just stroke on my dick like a stroker
Bitch I'm a big B, no honey, no poker
Bitch I'm a slime I'm a snake I'm a cobra
No slippin' not going out bad
No going out sad don't do that
Never slippin' grab the mac, never slippin' grab the mac
Catch me fucking all your folks
Catch me stroking like a boat
Got her slurpin till she croaks
Rhyme like a book nigga coat
Twist your flag like a Taliban, kill your man like Afghanistan
I'm getting cheese like a Packer fan
I ran it up and I bought the lamb

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over quarter million
It cost me like 260, I eat with the 5 stars
That perc got a nigga high, right now I'm a fly star
You can get popped when the twelve gaze
Don't let a cop get a shared case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace
Bitch, I'm so high as the nosebleed
Lil bitch got a booty like Rakishi
Lil bitch looking hot like a Taki
Beat all these boys like I'm Rocky

[Verse 2]
Pour up some Actavis and park the car
I just now ride the Bentley, fuck the law
Hop out another foreign right beside you
Hop out and watch them bitches drop their jaw
Put on some ice and ride them niggas Porsche
Hit like Mike Tyson why that nigga war
Looking so ratchet nigga get the point
Let all these real niggas out of the joint
Hittin these grandma's go get it
I'm on their head like a fitted
I'm a bad ass like them Billy's
Pull out and nut on them titties
I might bless her with a baby
Left her shot like a taser
In the club with some players
I kept grindin' and now I'm paid up
(Really rich, really rich, yeah)
Wheezy Beats

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over quarter million
It cost me like 260, I eat with the 5 stars
That perc got a nigga high, right now I'm a fly star
You can get popped when the twelve gaze
Don't let a cop get a shared case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace
Bitch, I'm so high as the nosebleed
Lil bitch got a booty like Rockies
Lil bitch looking hot as a tire key
Beat all these boys like I'm Rocky

[Outro:]
Penny loafer with alot of told you birds like Robbins
Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash never stop it
Baby I know you gon tell if I smoke em
Bitch I'm a big B no hundred no poker
