[Intro]
Hey
Screwed up
You look like a double cup stuffed ( yay!)
Don't do that babe , I love you
I love it

[Hook]
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , nooooo

[Verse: Dru Smith]
Don't never bitch come before mine
Double cup we go slow grind
If I'm doing time she gon write a nigga
Keep my books straight do the whole nine
She gon raise her right hand take her stand
Ride on her witness
I like to buy bags, spoil her feet
Have her flying in Fendi's
Keep it 1k, my bitch Ray Remler
Fell in love with her first day I hit her
Right all summer fuck her all winter
Took 'er to her momma' house, then I missed her
She a real nigga, had her ridin' with the killas
Let her head down when she ridin' with the smither
Don't trust these niggas told her ride with the pistol
We scrobbin' through we riddin' all silly

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no
No ceilings

[Verse 2: Squab]
I used to fuck this bad bitch
This bitch name was Trisha
She had a fat ass and that pussy was delicious
Now Trisha worked at the booty club
She had this one lil friend
Her friend name was Keisha, fat ass and waist thin
Keisha gave me that top
Real good chewin', did have no feelin's
Told her we can even get down on the floor if it ain't no silly
I fucked Keisha's best friend she was a bartender at the club
She ask me could she ride this pole
I told, baby girl ain't no love
Got my dawg off the chain and I'm out here chasin' cat
It is what it is give me that pussy, I'll break yo back
Let's get down, bend ova, and I'll put it all over yo spine
I'mma let my patna Thug tell ya Thugga, please tell her

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no
No ceilings

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Got me chillin', I left the girl fo' Philly because she gave me no sillies
I kept the girl chilli because she gave me no feelings
She had me numb, but I chilled on the soul
She know the dealin', now that I see her I know
She say I wanna kill her
She say her lil fume and how she couldn't heal 'im
I fucked all of her friends, now her friends
She wanna kill 'em
But it's only in her fuck, causee when we fuck
She used to tellin'
Especially this one bad bitch named Emilia
See I was sex limit, the fact it was like a million
And I ain't gon' lie, I liked her when she told me
But she shouldn't tell her
Cause she was like Wendy Williams

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no
No ceilings
