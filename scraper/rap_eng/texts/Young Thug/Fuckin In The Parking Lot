[Intro: Young Thug]
Ay, pussy nigga recording in the studio
Got me thinking he getting footage for my whole hoe
I'm paranoid, I'm glad that these ain't my hoes
I can't let 'em backstage at the crowd door
Wheezy beats

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, again (woah woah), again (woah woah), again, again (woah woah)
Pull up, fucking in school, right in the parking lot (smash, smash)
Again, then I found out on my teacher's spots (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot, again

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I put a hunnid racks to my brother (hunnid racks)
I spent another hunnid in the pen (hunnid more)
I been getting money, I don't need no other (need no niggas)
Nobody helped me, bitch I'm independent
All type of cash in my jeans, yeah (jeans yeah)
All type of cash on her spleen, yeah (put it on her spleen)
Only Chanel bags in her closet (all type)
Quarter ticket and they bragging (half millionaire dreams)
Foreign belt, this ain't no sagging (the world know what I'm dreaming)
You knew we living lavish (I had a dream)
Knew we living lavish (YSL on the street)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, again (woah woah), again (woah woah), again, again (woah woah)
Pull up, fucking in school, right in the parking lot (smash, smash)
Again, then I found out on my teacher's spots (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot, again

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Came up in the trap, but I started to rap, but I do this shit here for my kin now (kin)
They wondering how the fuck did I blow up and I went blow my buck in the Benz now (Benz, skrt)
I just want the money, don't need new friends (I don't)
I'm sitting back and I'm counting backend (count it up)
Mama proud, I been bringing racks in (Mama proud)
Bitch I [?] my ten
Soon as I wake up, get in
I had to pray and I knew I would win
Fuck with the rhythm, won't break or won't bend
Taking on twelve and I'm jumping the fence (taking on twelve)
Wrap it up, pack it up, shoot it long distance (wrap it up)
Stood on the block and I had to go get it (stood on the block)
Jewelry so cold just like fridges (fridges)
All of these bitches know that they with it (with it)
We in the city (city)
Chop the top off and I'm showing the titties (titties)
We living life and we living relentless (relentless)
Used to ride MARTA, now we ride in Bentley's (Bentley's)
Got in them bands, and then we popping wheelies (wheelies)
I lost my heart and I don't got no feelings (I don't)
I had to stack it and run up them digits (I had them)
Came from the block, I was dealing (dealing)
Signed to YSL, he gave me a milly (Duke)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, again (woah woah), again (woah woah), again, again (woah woah)
Pull up, fucking in school, right in the parking lot (smash, smash)
Again, then I found out on my teacher's spots (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot (smash, smash, smash)
Pull up to the school and fuck her in the parking lot, again
