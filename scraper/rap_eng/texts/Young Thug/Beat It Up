Why my bitch cheating on me?
What the fuck I do to her?
I ain’t did nothing nigga
Why she wanna play with me?
My feelings done got involved
Nah that bitch can't stay with me
Swear to God on my Grannie
Rest in peace to, Annie
Now the bitch got two daddies
This a reunion, no family!
I wanna fuck you in your best outfit girl put it on, Yeah
David Copperfield, baby girl I can get it gone, Nair
You the picture, Imma put you on the wall
I’m the hammer, you the nail
Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it!

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Put your ass to sleep, baby girl tempur-pedic
Cuhz whip it up, in a pan like Pita
Love big titties, turned on by them C Cups
Did a show in Boston drinking lean out a tea cup
No party, I’m sorry
Ridin’ round in the motorcycle, no Harley
That lil ho retarded, had to nickname lil bitch.. tortoise
Shootin’ shots, I ignore it
Pants saggin’ cause I walk around with that 40
Nigga talkin’ beef, eat it up cause I’m hungry
Fuck YARS, nigga im extortin’
Feelin’ like J-Prince nigga
J-Prince son Jas, fuck with me every time
I was in LA chillin’ at Jas Prince house
A deal, I ain't never signed
I ain't never ever ever lost shit
Kill a nigga, knock em off, what's a fuckin' lawsuit?
Shoot a nigga momma house up, no talkin’
(Shh) Too much talkin’…
Ran off with a 100 bands, I ain't playin'
Cut a promoter, thought I was playin'
Got a 2-2-3 Lebron James, Cleveland
Why am I insecure bout my woman?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I don’t lick pussy but tonight I might eat it
I don’t want that shit lil bitch, I just want my receipt back
She grippin’ on my nuts, Michael Jackson I might beat it
Her first name Victoria, I know she got some secrets
I don’t wanna fuck with her, if she ain't gon’ keep it
Real with a nigga till the end, girl I need ya
Let me put my dick inside your hole, peep it
Thugga want your soul, he need it

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
She ain't got too many times, she got 3 stripes like an Adidas (Ay)
Let the lil bitch come roll me like tempur-pedic (Ay)
Throw that pussy, I catch it like a receiver play
If she find out I cheated, she might just leave that day
Put that lil bitch on her feet, no bengay
Jonesboro South raised me, that’s what kids say
And my diamonds they come wet like a fish tank
Lil money big bank take lil bank (Yeah)
Lil nigga wanna play, I’ll leave em in a wheel chair
Yellow bone bitch from Toronto, she a regular
When I kiss her, I be suckin on her neck like Dracula
And I’m a motherfuckin’ lion, nigga cats kill
