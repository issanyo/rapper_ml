[Intro: Skeme]
Who dat? Who dat? Who dat? (woah)
Who dat? Who dat? Who dat? (woah)

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Young S K E woah
Some folks say he so
G A N G S T A
T T G O
I won’t cut cake these hoes
Man I’d rather chase this dough
Only suckers put pussy over paper
Fuck y’all take me for?
And before I eat steaks with fakes I throw a ski mask on my face
Put my right shoulder to a front door and then run in and snatch me a safe
Went and made a meal then I said my grace
Then I cleaned everything on my plate
Then I hit a bad bitch, I made her cum first
Then I came fashionably late

[Hook: Skeme & Young Thug]
Right, don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga (on bloods)
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga (on bloods)
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Rari for the trash and a Rari for the luxury
Bands for my mama’s kids and bands for my children
Come and make a deal like a motherfucking pickle
I am so for real, sold half a million ‘fore I killed you
I’m after shawty, his bitch think that I am the bomb like a muhfucking missile
Catch me in traffic when you see me don’t look suprizzled
You don’t want war we kill niggas, and go bout our day like it’s nizzle
I’m so proficient ain't talkin Trey Songz with the Trigga

[Hook: Skeme & Young Thug]
Don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga (on bloods)
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga (on bloods)
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Reviewing deals on my iPhone, you know paper be my priority
But that paper don’t sit over loyalty
I follow G codes, ain’t no ho in me
I’m that nigga, that nigga that pull up with killers
And knock on the haters that say they don’t feel us
Been triller, so triller, get skrilla for realer
My bank account overstuffed, keep them shits filled up
Overloaded, bloated, pockets overflowing
Got to get this dough and blow it like I grow it
Necklace heavy, glowing
And I leave this show in gold grills, looking like I rep the Nolia
I got too much drive to call a fucking chauffeur
High as heaven, tryna parallel the rover
In this beeper bitch we going [?]
You niggas out here be sweet as Russel Stovers

[Hook: Skeme & Young Thug]
Don’t compare me with no rat niggas
Came from the trenches, now look where we at nigga
Been balling for a stretch, check the stats nigga
I’mma fuck around and change my name to that nigga
