[Intro]
BL$$D
Hah, yeah, yeah
Future, baby, Thugger Thugger
Ayo Chef
Pocket

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I got came from a lick
Ice on all my watches, I'm the shit
Underneath the turf's the worst it's gon' get (It's gon' get)
Whipped up water on my wrist, came from a fish (Young BL$$D, boy, you saucin')

[Chorus]
Dip and dab out the bag (Dab out the bag)
I got Crips on Old Nat (Got Crips on Old Nat)
You don't want problems for somethin' (Don't want problems for somethin')
Need to get you some racks (Need to get you some racks)
She gon' bring it to Daddy (She gon' bring it to daddy)
Eat the cake out her panties (Eat the cake out her panties)
I was cool as a cat (I was cool as a cat)
State all facts
If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Still rich)
Three million dollar house, came from evictions (Hood rich)
Out here on a jet and a cruise ship (Cruise ship)
Last night I stole the yacht to cruise in it (Cruise in it)
If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Hood rich)
If I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (Hood rich)
If I fuck these hoes, then I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
I can't fuck these hoes, they might try to pull a trick (And what?)
Ain't no slippin' (Let's go)

[Verse]
The coupe is outside and I'm styled in the best (Yeah)
I see you killin' these niggas, you doin' it the best
Solitaries, ain't nothing, to me
Coca leaves like I got leukemia
For real, la familia, I go gorilla, I'm part of the Bape team
Fuck you thought?
Supreme Louis quilt, hang low as a drag queen
I'm in a bronze Benz, I think it's the wagon
Ever since mom's titty, bitch I was flaggin' (Woop, woop)
She got some water on, she my Cancun thing (She my Cancun thing)
I got some black diamonds, my wrist is on Beijing (My wrist is on Beijing)
I'm tellin' all of my hoes give they orders to the maid (Hold on, turn up)
I got 20 bitches with me and they ain't throwin' shade (Woo, woo)
I got 20 closets, I could dress accordin' to the wave (Yeah, yeah)
I'm with 20 models, but I dress accordin' to the bae (Hah)
I'm goin' all in 'bout my bro and my paper (What?)
Ain't got no fuckin' neighbors (And what?)
Ain't got no neighbors
Yeah
No neighbors, oh

[Chorus]
Dip and dab out the bag
I got Crips on Old Nat
You don't want problems for somethin'
Need to get you some racks
She gon' bring it to daddy
Eat the cake out her panties
I was cool as a cat
State all facts
If I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Hood rich)
If I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (Hood rich)
If I fuck these hoes, then I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
I can't fuck these hoes, they might try to pull a trick (And what?)
Ain't no slippin' (Let's go)
