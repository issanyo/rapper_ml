[Verse 1]
How the fuck a nigga gon' try tell me
Bout the motherfucking ice that I'm rocking
'Bout the motherfucking bitches that I'm fucking
And, sucking and putting them in a bucket then
Beat that pussy up like it's the twelfth round
Up in niggas towns with my Zoe Pounds
I don't go around since it come around
Wet diamonds in my mouth if I kiss her she drown
If I leave a nigga white T-Shirt red
It'll be a peppermint or a baseball nigga
I know they sick and tired of hearing bout my jewelery
But if it fall on the ground
Yeah you might just slip and fall nigga
She a shark she like a jaws nigga
Your bitch says she wants a tall nigga
You are one midget you too small nigga
She suck my dick and rub my balls nigga
Big money over here, man
Still active don't let me show all my skills man
Yeah my jeans they blue dolphin not no SEALs man
I run up money run up gold like a pilgrim

[Chorus]
Nigga how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes
Yeah, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
And them boys they had no dope I was selling you mine
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
Little nigga go ahead tell me what's all on your mind
Yeah, all on your mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Nigga, big bands on my mind nigga
Nigga, catch these ones like the swine nigga
Nigga, you be cuffing with no ties nigga
Twin dimes and they mine, fold em like a pork rind
I know bloods that rock burgundy, no wine
Told that nigga best believe imma stay one round
In the back of the car screaming YSL hold it down
Yeah, hold it down till he come back off on an appeal
That's the real deal
I'mma eat that pussy down then I'mma roll up some kush straight out the fields
I told her straight to her face if she don't do it I know someone that will
You know the deal
I don't want to drink no lean with these niggas if it's not double sealed
And that's the real
Nigga big B balling no budget
And my car is rare like a mullet
I've seen this bitch from up the stairs she ain't ugly
Bitches bome up to my room and they get slutty
Bitches ball me Jeff and the F stand for fuck it
One more time for my jewelry, yes it's flooded
Take that dick up out her coochie, then I butt it
All these niggas with me blooded, like we cutted

[Chorus]
Nigga how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes
Yeah, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
And them boys they had no dope I was selling you mine
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
Little nigga go ahead tell me what's all on your mind
Yeah, all on your mind, yeah
