[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah
Woah woah, woah, woah, woah
Aye

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion (Woo!)
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian (Beast!)
Told my baby next February we're married (On blood!)
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious (Hah!)
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (pew pew pew pew)
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (on blood)
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (skrrrrrt)
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (gah gah gah gah)
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Aye, I fuck that bitch just like a centipede (Damn!)
I'm not no pussy, so they on my D (They on my what?)
I flood out shawty's wrist and now they digg (Roll it! Roll it! Roll it!)
I'm whippin' soda up in NOLA, bitch (Woop! Woop!)
The inside of my car lizard like a sofa, bitch (Swoo!)
I wear it like Cinderella, then I smoked the bitch (Cinderella!)
Hey, my ice is skating, where my roller, bitch? (Gah!)
The dope can get a lil colder, like a polar, bitch (Whip! Whip!)
I, answer the call then put it right beside me (Skrrrt!)
Two, hundred on that pussy like the new Spyder (Skrrrt!)
Keep, your mouth closed, I'm the supplier and buyer (Woah! Woah!)
I, just might one night her, I might go and wife her (Damn!)
Hey, I'm bangin' green like the lizard with Geico (Woo!)
I, might catch you and burn your top like Michael (Woo!)
I, got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles (Gah! Gah!)
No Chief Keezy but I might bite her, then

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm not gon' pass, I'ma smash 'em
She want that nut so I blast her
My Bentley grey like a pastor
Whippin' that snow, no Alaska
Good head, she got her masters
Shawty a long way from dumb
Your money flat like a plasma
Good kush, smoke is the bomb
I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red
I don't fall in love, I run over it instead
Hey, babe, bobble, that big ol' head
I'm like, "lil baby, I don't know your kid"
I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead
They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy
Baby take a picture, get that photo cred
She make me lean back like a sofa bed

[Hook: Young Thug & Jim Jones]
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion (Woo!)
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian (Beast!)
Told my baby next February we're married (On blood! Word)
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious (Hah!)
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings (Word)
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (pew pew pew pew)
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean (Chill)
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (on blood)
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme (C'yeah)
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (skrrrrrt)
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team (Word)
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (gah gah gah gah)
Yeah! (Jones, Jones)
