[Hook]
I got a thick bitch I know how to dress her
I ran my money up then I stuffed my bezel
A lot of thick bitches coming by the zeroes
And I didn't show none of this bitches the schedule
I gotta horse looking bitch that like to wrestle
I got all my niggas looking so successful
I want fuck all these Little bitches like R Kelly
I'm the reason all of these niggas looking scary
All my niggas we gone leave this life daily
I want a bitch from San Diego Bay
I swear to God I want that pussy I would pay
Calm down boy I'm home you away
Ok my bitch let me dive from the dresser
Boy I done been to a hundred islands no dressing
I want to teach you like Thug a professor
I think she did pray to god cause I'm a blessing

[Verse 1]
And I got a thick bitch I know how to dresser
I'ma walk straight up on that lil bitch and I'ma press her
Baby I'm the king, Elvis Presley (king)
Baby don't wanna come out that dream she super waking
Suck my mother fucking Nutty Buddy (nutty)
Even if I'm legally blind I'm still busting (bitch)
Even when I was dead broke bitch I wasn't bluffing (racks!)
I won't get 5 percent without my muddy
Riding round the city with my daddy (psh)
Real gold on, bitch, I need a Grammy
Fuck I'm too geeked up I need some dabbies (rrt!)
Got gas can't smell no body
YSL got racks no wallets (racks!)
That's all you see little baby
Still geeked up in the lobby (ah!)
You know the routine little baby (routine)
I might buy a hot Benz, change the VIN on it
I might walk inside club and go Sudan on it (woo)
I might shoot a gun at you by my fan homie
Not playin' got a band
With saran on it, and
Stayed down with me and my man homie , and
Got a bottle full of Hen and a xan on it, and
You can pull all of my tips in the can homie (what?)
If the guy ain't seen put the man on it
(woo)
