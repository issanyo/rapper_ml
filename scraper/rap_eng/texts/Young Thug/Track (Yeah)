[Intro : Young Thug]

[Verse 1 : Lil Duke & Young Thug]
Hit a nigga bitch from the back, while I'm pulling on her tracks
So I do it like that
Get a bitch bitch come back, like crack
And I'm like...
Yeahhhhhhh
That will get ya mothafucking mind right, riding round on a late night
On a bitch ass like some break lights
Ask her do she wanna see what i taste, like and she like...
Yeahhhhhhh
And she let me ride on her back like pegs
She just wanna watch a nigga move like the feds
If a nigga play with me his ass going to bed
Bullets going threw a nigga head, like dreads
Yeahhhhhhh
Trapping and serving them fish scales
I brought up work and I don't need a scale
Boxes just land and they came threw the mail
Yeahhhhhhh

[Verse 2 : Young Thug]
Flooded water, she got lemon head, lemon head
I like head, she like head
Both of us like head
Yeahhhhhhh
Bone crusher Thugga Thugga, I'm not never scared
Bitch you boneless and you gooey like a fucking Egg
Yeahhhhhhh
And I won't waste my time
I won't waste my time (No!)
Even though I ain't write these, these are dedicated lines
Yeahhhhhhh
Hit that bitch from the binnack
I might pull out all her trinnacks
Old man asking is the girl coming binnack
And I'm like...
Yeahhhhhhh
I don't play games, baby girl I ain't lame
Take the bitch behind the building, let her suck my thang
She gonna die with me, she insane
So I'm like...
Yeahhhhhhh
Kaww! Woooooo!
Young Duke come poppin' out the roof
He gonna blow a bitch ass, I'm something like a flute
My old lady say I'm lame, but my hoe say I'm the truth
And my fans like...
Yeahhhhhhh
