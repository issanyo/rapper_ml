[Verse: Young Thug]
It was ice to the bird make him chirp
My niggas gon' shoot it off first
Take another sip, and then burp
Raise yo' bitch and make her work
Got yo' bitch slurpin' on her knees
All a nigga gave her was a perc
Make a nigga nut, and then leave!
Let a nigga put it on your shirt
These bitches gon' suck on the low
These bitches gon' suck on the ball
These bitches gon' suck on my sausage
These bitches gon' suck on the north
These bitches gon' suck on the south
These bitches gon' fuck in the east and west
I'm high, my clouds are south
These bitches act up cause they know you best
Let lil' bitch go and slurp
Now she actin' like she know a nigga
These niggas they drinkin' on Watson now
And then they try and get outta pocket now
Yo bitch, her knees, they knockin' now
I know you mad, I'm poppin' now
And I got everybody watchin' now
I fuck around shoot at your socket now

Bought me a pound, its bout to go down

These bitches tryna' get grants
Out in bel harbor all on the re-up
Passing Chanel with the girls
Got me some diamonds and pearl
Run up on that nigga watch you get swirled
I got real niggas thats all in the can
I'm gonna hop up if I get the chance
I check up on my momma make sure shes alright
All the fake niggas just be like some dykes

[Verse 3: Trez]
It was certain shit I couldn't explain
A lot of shit that I never had
Remember I didn't have enough cash
Remember all the cold nights on the block had to get it back
Remember rappin' for big jack he told me I need to push that
These days I just wanna see my whole hood back
I'm wishin' that my cousin never even took that
Ran it up tell myself to never even look back (I ain't goin' back)
Cause when I make it, I could bring juug back
And money I'm good with that
Remember rappin' for zara in four seasons
You think about its, say damn twice
I know you rappin', its your season
Really on the block for no reason
Gotta watch the boys that ain't eatin'
They creepin', But I ain't sleepin'
I'm eatin' pizza at CiCi's pizza
