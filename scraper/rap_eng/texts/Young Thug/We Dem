Niggas don't know, where they really can see
And them niggas won't go, where they wanna be
And I really don't know, why they wanna hate me
But I already know we right there where they wanna be

That's us, ahh
Ok my [?] transformer and my blunts are enormous
Burnin' rubber like a muthafuckin' condom
That lil bitch know that I like her, she got tipsy from persona
Climbin' on her like a lil lissy iguana ahh
Eat that pussy like a little creamy mama ahh
Beat that pussy, bet it look like I just thumped her ahh
Nigga cookin' fish scale while my toilet thot
Get rocks till I die, scream fuck the cops
On my block, we sell bricks and rock (what)
Set up shop, whatya, all I got (stop)
On that clock, diamonds with no mop
And if money grow on trees, I'm a fuckin' sloth
Bitch play with my ball, get stuck with a foul
Yeah, based on my swagger, should I put this shit out?
Now, these hoes adore ya, ya swaggin' like Thugger
You should say happy mothers day cause I'm ballin' wit mother
See you lil niggas, man...
