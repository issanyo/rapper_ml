[Hook]
You
You the one I spend my time with, i'm with you
Ima run and buy you mink just like a zoo
Ima treat it like a real man supposed too
Buy you diamonds with the matching Robbins too
If i'm riding, boy, you know she riding too
She gon ride it like a Kawasaki, woo
If you don't know her boy don't walk up like you do
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1]
Ima cash out even though I'm not Ca$h out
Ima pull up with a mink just like a chow
So much money you can't go in, boy stay out
50,000 on the teeth and she don't even talk
Mella Vanilla I put that dick straight in her mouth
Bitch i'm the realest, i'm the one million in the house
A B C D E F bitch you know that i'm a G
All over boss, a case see, like she know Jodeci
Won't you please come around when i'm in the town baby?
She don't got weed but when she text me she use pounds baby
Shopping spree we take this to a couple towns baby
Then when I lay you down, don't want no drawers baby

[Hook]
You
You the one I spend my time with, i'm with you
Ima run and buy you mink just like a zoo
Ima treat it like a real man supposed too
Buy you diamonds with the matching Robbins too
If i'm riding, boy, you know she riding too
She gon ride it like a Kawasaki, woo
If you don't know her boy don't walk up like you do

[Bridge]
I, I, I wanna marry you
You are art, one uncomparable
Baby other pussy so terrible
I might spend 50 thousand on ?

[Verse 2]
Walk in my territory
I come, fast in a hurry
She go slow when she slurp it
Ima buy it then work it
I got sprite mixed with purp
Break that pussy like a burglary
I was broke, now i'm worthy
I'm just living, live and learn it
All my partners, they working
My hoe cute with no surgery
I keep buying her these purses
Mink, rollie's, these perfect
I will come in her pussy just like a surgeon

[Hook]
You
You the one I spend my time with, i'm with you
Ima run and buy you mink just like a zoo
Ima treat it like a real man supposed too
Buy you diamonds with the matching Robbins too
If i'm riding, boy, you know she riding too
She gon ride it like a Kawasaki, woo
If you don't know her boy don't walk up like you do
