[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what you heard about me
Don't believe what them people said, they talkin'
Close your ears, they know nothin' 'bout me
They be talkin' tryna find out about me
I don't know what you might heard about me
I don't want her first if she not no virgin
I tell her hold on to her purse and it get caught on swervin'
You may not know what you're worth, but I'm glad I found you

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I thought I had her, but she left
Her faby glass, it was Chanel
She leave me all out by myself
Don't know where to go, I need help
Cry a river just to wash your tears
These bitches all on me like shelves
No candy, I want M's
She dancin', cuz I'm him
That me, that dude 'fore talkin' "I'm higher than a blimp"
I know I'm gon' keep it real
I know I am not from Houston
I know I'm gon' keep it trill
I know exactly why I do it, to kill or be kill
In this game, it is what it is

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Glad I found you, baby if you get sick, I wanna go buy the soup
And even when we get married, I wanna help find a suit
Baby you go dyin', I wanna go die with you
If I go missing lil mama could find me
She wanna live life like a dream
Make me wanna find you
And I'm gon buy that bitch a coupe
She gon' whip it out just like a tool
She got me actin lame like I'm her dude
I got.. the key to her heart, yeah, that's my boo
I could play poker, bet everything except for you
Loaded with this shit just like a jew
And just, I just
