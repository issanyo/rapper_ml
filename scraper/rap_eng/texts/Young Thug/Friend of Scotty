She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
She was a friend of Dolla, now she a friend of molly
I slid up on that pussy like I'm playin' hockey
She hopped up on my dick like a fuckin' jockey
Made me cum quick like a fuckin' 'Rari
Hop out the bed
Gotta get back to the bread
Roll up and smoke on the kush
Pull up and fuck on your bitch
I know I ain't shit, she think I'm the shit
In designer shit, and a foreign whip
Got her brainwashed, brainwashed
This money got her brainwashed, she don't think twice
I want her some more, I want her some more
I want her some more, ooh yeah, yeah

I'ma do my best, like the fifth-grade test
Gotta make it to the six, my bro gone buy me that new vet'
No Michael Vick, but these bitches want a dog like Lil Tic
No homo, but my blunt look like a dick
Punchanella, punchanella, I'mma make it rain
Bring your umbrella, check the schedule
I can lick your ear soft as a feather, hello
How ya doin? This for my neighbor, Carmelo
Brainwashed, brainwashed, little buddy got me brainwashed
I can't think twice
I want her some more, I want her remorse, I want her remorse

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I got three best friends, they tell me 'bout all of my hoes
You wanna bool with me? Cause I give 'em a hundred to wash my clothes
We built off unity, I got them young nats callin' me early like I'm truancy
They wanna get with me, make a flick with me
Thugger Thugger, baby, take her to Italy
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road, I know she missin' me
But I'mma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Birds fly high, but you fly higher
You got a man, and I don't want to but I got to despise you
For dinner time, come heeere, come heeere, woah woah
