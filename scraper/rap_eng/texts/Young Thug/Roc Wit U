[Intro]
Yeah yeah

Hey yeah

[Hook: Young Thug]
Ride on top of my head
Pullin' all on my dreads
Pin her down to the bed
I'mma keep my neck on top of her neck
I want rock, I want rock with you
Start from the bottom, go to the top with you
Smoke OG, then some moon rock with you, yeah
Never can't stop never never stop with ya

[Verse 1: Arean]
Yeah
Goldie locks, with the golden Glock
Two golden socks, take her over stock
She walk with a coach a lot
Sixteen suite down floors both a lot
Can't say with the way they staring
Because you're wearing piercings and earrings
Daydream, thats the way I felt
Can't play you, the way I love
Plus I want it fresh out the seal
And you gotta ass that could stretch out brazil
Hit it from the back, pull the mess out your hair
You ain't gotta ask, I'm the best, I can tell, still
Lay with you and to play with you on the real
Hand with you and to stay with me on the hill
Everyday its the same thang, in the 8th grade we ain't never had it this way, oh well
Your eyes, tell me the reason for your lies
I cannot say what she needs me for
Fell in love with a eastside boy
Come on by you could be my toy
Stay with me, I play with you

[Hook: Young Thug]
Right on top of my haters
Pullin' off on my dreads
Treat her down to the best
I'mma keep my left top of her neck
I want rock, I want rock with you
Start from the bottom, go to the top with you
Smoke OG, then some moon rock with you, yeah
Never can't stop never never stop with ya

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Tootsie roll, I was stoppin' by but I'm leavin' now
But I thought you should know
The way you work the pole
The way you work them knees
The way you work them bowls
The way you surf the bro
The way you work the bro
The way you work for more
Make that Coochie cum like a vibrator
I'ma fly through like a skyscraper
I swear to god, I done slip and fell in love, love, love, love
Dick a sword, I'ma cut cut cut
I'm Jeff where the fuck is my mud
Cherries all on the top
Bitch you know what time it is like clocks
I would never lose like Papa Doc
We at the spot, I hit her spot and now she

[Hook: Young Thug]
Right on top of my haters
Pullin' off on my dreads
Treat her down to the best
I'mma keep my left top of her neck
I want rock, I want rock with you
Start from the bottom, go to the top with you
Smoke OG, then some moon rock with you, yeah
Never can't stop never never stop with ya
