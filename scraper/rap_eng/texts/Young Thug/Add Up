[Chorus: Starrah & Young Thug]
Spend it all, make it back, counting up another stack (Count up)
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
I look like a robbed a back, suit it up I need a tank
Mad dough, mad dough, mad dough
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough (Yee!)
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up
Spend it all, make it back, counting up another stack (Count up)
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
I look like a robbed a back (Suit it up)
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough (Thugger)
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough (Add up, add up yeah)
Add up, add up, add up (Add up, add up, add up yeah)
Add up the mad dough, suit it up I need a tank (Woo!)
Add up, add up the mad dough (Woo!)

[Verse: Young Thug]
I flipped the packages (I flipped the packages)
Perform at the Madison (perform at the Madison)
My life's so [?] (my life is so crazy)
He ran and I captured it ([?])
Run up on my teachers (woo!)
Ran into some features (woo!)
I'm a really rich 90s baby (swag)
I don't know 'bout no beepers (I promise)
I was just boolin', caking money with my time
She said she don't leave me, she in love with how I grind (swear)
Lot of hundreds on me, make it look like I got thighs (damn)
I'm a king cobra bitch, I'm aiming for your spine (slime!)
Dancing all on me, working and twerking all on me (yeah)
[?] all on me (yeah)
Keep up with my circle, you don't know me (yeah)
They all tryna do me, now I'm loony (woo)
I drink on that shit until I'm woozy (woo)
I wanna hold back and put all loot in (yee)
I'm back on the block and back boomin', I promise

[Chorus: Starrah & Young Thug]
Spend it all, make it back, counting up another stack
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
I look like a robbed a back, suit it up I need a tank
Mad dough, mad dough, mad dough
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up
Spend it all, make it back, counting up another stack
Rack up, rack up, rack up
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
I look like a robbed a back (Suit it up)
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
Add up, add up, add up the mad dough
Add up, add up, add up
Add up the mad dough, suit it up I need a tank
Add up, add up the mad dough
