[Intro: Young Thug]
In the booth with money in my hand
I love the feeling
It give me chills, ya digg


[Verse/Hook: Young Thug]
I heard love don't last forever, but I'ma change
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, bang anything about that cheddar, yeah
But really I allow whatever
I'mma bang, bangin' bout that mozzarella
And yes I'm bangin', I'm bangin' [?]
I'm bangin' like I'm not a rapper
Forreal I got mine (I got mine, aye)
I could care what you do with yours as long as I got mine
(as I got mine, yeah)
A rich nigga so she miss it
I'ma [?] with the wrist aye


[Verse: Young Thug]
Mixin' purple with the green like a turtle
Went in for my baby
Bitch I'm goin' in for my lady

On it when she [?]

[Verse: Future]
Thats the mood thats the motto
Twenty bad bitches, like to feed em seafood
Twenty real niggas

[Hook: Young Thug]
I heard love don't last forever
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, anything about that cheddar
I'mma bang bout that mozzarella

[Verse: Young Thug]
Got a tool on me in the Wraithy and the Tahoe

[Hook: Young Thug]
I heard love don't last forever
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, anything about that cheddar
I'mma bang bout that mozzarella
