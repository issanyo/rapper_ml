[Pre-Hook]
I got me a K in this place
Baby, don’t play in this place
You can call me ace in this place
Ten thousand dollar vase in his face
Bring them racks out the safe
Go to church like Mase
Put a mask on my face
Beat the case in my case any day

[Hook]
Fuck a nigga bitch, that’s all
Grabbin' on my dick, that’s all
Stuntin' with my bitch, that’s all
Grindin' with my clique, that’s all
My cup gotta be muddy, that’s all
She tell me that she love me, that’s all
I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh)
She fuckin' all my buddies, that’s all

[Verse 1]
She fuckin' all my buddies
I might love fuckin' it, but I just cannot love it
I might catch a nigga bitch and fuck her right on Gresham
Bitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly
I might pull up with all of my jewelry on like Busta
Got a unique body, my clothes, get ‘em from Russia
I might pull up and pimp that bitch just like a sucka
I don't give a fuck about these lil shrimps, I got my mustard, ketchup, nigga
Nigga loaded pimpin', pimp tight, game right
I might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes
Treat that pussy Tempur-Pedic, and call it a night
She compliment on my fly, and I ain't talking no flight
And therefore I love her
She make a nigga shine without using butter
My partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother
We don't want no one other, we got one another
She know I got her, we got each other
She know I'ma grip her weave when I fuck her
She know I'ma go over C's like a Blood
Hey baby my name Jeff and Mudd

[Pre-Hook]
I got me a K in this place
Baby, don’t play in this place

Ten thousand dollar vase in his face
Bring them racks out the safe in this place
Go to church like Mase any day
Put a mask on my face any day
Beat the case in my case any day

I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh)
She fuckin' all my buddies, that’s all

[Verse 2]
I wanna hit that middle like a mullet
I can see straight through you like a bullet
Shawty want my closet like a hood
Fuck all of my fellas, no good
Bitch I am a tiger, no wood
I done see more holes than Tiger Woods
When she with me she just do it
She can't fit into these jeans don't do it

[Bridge 1]
She remember me
She remember everything about me
She remember me
She remember, she remember everything
She remember me
She remember me
She do it, she do, she do

[Verse 3]
She remember I'm a young nigga
Every time she sees those racks she wants a son, nigga
She know I'm in her mouth just like some gum, nigga
I might give her my all, then some, nigga
I'm strapped, my fingers itching, check my palms, nigga
My girl gon' relax, and dressed in Toms, nigga
I got Lil' Bobby say I am a tall nigga
You know my cup is pink, like bubblegum, nigga

[Bridge 2]
Easter pink, pussy wetter than a sink
I'll get down on my knees
If I can't have you you're deceased
That means I couldn't be
Baby, I can't see, curiosity
In love with the opposite of me
Do you dig it?

[Hook]
Fuck a nigga bitch, that’s all
Grabbin' on my dick, that’s all
Stuntin' with my bitch, that’s all
Grindin' with my clique, that’s all
My cup gotta be muddy, that’s all
She tell me that she love me, that’s all
I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh)
She fuckin' all my buddies, that’s all
