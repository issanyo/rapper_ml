[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, I'm on the run
Here I come, I'm with your mom
(Fuck all that, let's go)
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus: Young Thug]
If the opp come, I get to squeezin' on the mop
I'm on the run, bitch, I just took off on the cops
I don't need a charm, bitch, I need a lawyer in rocks
I got the drum, bitch, 'bout to connect some of these dots, ayy
I just might hop inside a cab today (skrt)
Lamborghini Urus, paper tag today (aye)
When I bend the corner, man, the rims bent (bent)
Burberry guts what the captain say (Slatt)
Chanel, she can get a little tab today (Chanel)
Fuck around and drop a few bags today
I just might do the whole dash today (woo!)
Might do Balenciaga rags today (oh, damn, woo!)

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Niggas might kill for biscuits
Trappin' out the intercontinental (hey!)
Bitch can't wait 'til my check clear
Bitch gon' act like she triller (act like she triller)
Baby tryna trip me outta check (woah)
Nigga tryna pour my red
All a nigga know is take meds
Nigga, stop drinkin' my red (woo!)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Slime all these niggas, I'm tired of trie
I just sit back and smoke out a pound of weed (smoke out)
I got rollies galore, ain't no clowning me
I got woadies with me speaking Chinese (got woadies right now, now)
I get fed up and throw a catastrophe (fed up)
In the drop, me, my dog had 'em ten key (woo!)
Secret service, so everything is touchscreen
I had walked in the loft, didn't insert a key (blast-off)
Okay, pattycake, baguettes, the karats, no carrot cake (baguettes! Yeah, bitch)
For God's sake, stack up your racks, put it all away (ooh, let's go)
Polish your ass, polish your stomach
And polish your face (polish your face)
Stack up the cash, go buy Richard Mille, that's all I can say (woo!)
Whole lotta gang shit, whole lotta this and that
Whole lotta ain't this (whole lotta, whole lotta)
Whole lotta cash over here, no whole lotta playing (oh, oh)
I spent your stash box on a little Mercedes
I popped at the last opp, and I end up escapin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
If the opp come, I get to squeezin' on the mop
I'm on the run, bitch, I just took off on the cops
I don't need a charm, bitch, I need a lawyer in rocks
I got the drum, bitch, 'bout to connect some of these dots, ayy
I just might hop inside a cab today (skrt)
Lamborghini Urus, paper tag today (aye)
When I bend the corner, man, the rims bent (bent)
Burberry guts what the captain say (woah woah woah)
Chanel, she can get a little tab today (Chanel)
Fuck around and drop a few bags today
I just might do the whole dash today (woo!)
My new Balenciaga rags today (oh, damn, woo!)

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Offset]
Niggas might kill for biscuits

Bitch can't wait 'til my check clear
Bitch gon' act like she triller
Baby tryna trip me outta check (woah)
Nigga tryna pour my red (woah)
All a nigga know is take meds (woah)
Nigga, stop drinkin' my red
Woo, woo, woo, woo woo, Offset!

[Verse 2: Offset]

Fuckin' bitches with my bitch on lock (lock, lock, lock)
