[Bridge]
I was livin' large with the racks in the bar
I was livin' large with the straps on the couch
I was livin' large with rats in the house
I was just gonna shoot 'em in the back of the scalp
I was just gonna ride with the girl, RiRi
We would tear up the streets, told my mama get it all
I was just gon' change like the World Metta Peace
Like I was gon' shoot a nigga back of the couch

[Chorus]
Let that cash talk (cash)
Let that cash talk (cash)

Sprinkle that shit with that water
Watch that cash breed

Nigga, play with YSL, we make a whole scene
Let that cash talk
