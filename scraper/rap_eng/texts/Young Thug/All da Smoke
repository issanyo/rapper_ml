Stackin' it tall (Thugger)
Every nigga out my city became a boss (Became)

Pyrex, cook it up like Kyrie, trade you off (Let's go)
Green and white like Celtics, don't play with me, play with a fork (Play with a woop)
I'm superior, I'm imperial, I ain't feelin' you (Ooh)
I could eat me some heroin or buy a brick (Yeah, yeah)
I got Barry Bonds on my wrist (Yeah)
Blowed your college fund (Where?), on my bitch (Woo, woo)
Out the slums, taking a chance, toting tommy guns (Brrt)
Left out of school, started selling rocks, bought me a drop (Skrrt)
Cartier frames, Cartier rings, Cartier socks (On God)
Homicide Gang, they gon' put you on Fox (Homicide, Homicide)
Putang ran up a whole M sittin' in the box (Facts)

Far gone, I'm so gone on it
Three hundred racks for a Bentley truck, yeah yeah
Take the factories off and go'n and lift it up, yeah yeah (Lift it up)
Cash all on your bitch, she on the living room floor (Yeah)
Having a private party, you know how that go (Let go)

And don't you take that to the head (No)
You know I got you in my will (Yeah)
Told big dawg bring the bricks in
Got a hundred more at the crib (Ayy)
Make the dope do the windmill (Yeah)
Nigga swing through at your wheels (Brrt)
They done quoted two on killed
And I was in Miami countin' a mil' (Ayy)
I told my bitch, "No more ass shots"
She stopped all the way like a stop sign when it's traffic time
My diamonds dark brown like Budweiser (Like Budweiser)
Count a half a mil with my bitch, now her feelings sloppy (Yeah, yeah)
Came up out the projects, ain't have shit, yeah (On God)
I wiped a nigga nose for a ticket (Slime)
Hit it from the back (Yeah)
Make her say slime, say slatt (Yeah, yeah)

Whipped up the fish Parkay and got racks, ayy
