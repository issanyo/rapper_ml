[Intro: Young Thug]
Know your place, okay?
I want to speak to Pablo
Not to you shit chickens

[Hook: Figg Panamera & Young Thug]
I came to see Pablo
The man that has all of the coca
I came to see Pablo
His face is all over the posters
I came to see Pablo
The man that has all of the coca
I came to see Pablo
His face is all over the posters


[Bridge: Young Thug]
I came to see Pablo
I came to see Pablo
I came to see Pablo
I came to see Pab-
Blow, that dick blow
That kush she blow
That coca blow
That mota blow
Woaah, blow, like I gon' blow
Woaah, blow, like candle blow

[Verse: Young Thug]
Suck on my dick, then she gon' suck on the clit on my bitch
And I got bandz on the one way, they coming, they coming, they give me double what I get
Where they got Wilson on Wilson, these guys they look like they his bitch
I swear to god If I don't make it, I'll quit rapping, I'm taking trips, no quick
Balls are inside of my necklace, all on my jewelry, it's hidden, it's treasurement
We just might stack on your bestest man, he got on white, now it's red like a peppermint
You do not look too official, you come up right here, boy they gon' have to check you, man
I swear to God man Young Thugga be booling like motherfucking fire flames

[Hook: Figg Panamera & Young Thug]
I came to see Pablo
The man that has all of the coca
I came to see Pablo
His face is all over the posters
I came to see Pablo
The man that has all of the coca
I came to see Pablo
His face is all over the posters
