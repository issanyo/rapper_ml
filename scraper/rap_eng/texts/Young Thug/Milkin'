[Hook: Young Thug & (Problem)]
Milkin' these hoes, milkin' these hoes
Milkin' these hoes, milkin' these hoes
Cuffin' my bros, cuffin' my bros
Cuffin' my bros, cuffin' all bros
Milkin' these hoes, cuffin' my bros
(Get to the money, let's get to the money, yeah)
Milkin' these hoes, cuffin' my bros
(Get to the money, let's get to the money)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Milkin' these hoes, cuffin' my bros
2 million dollar mansion with a swimming pool in the back like it ain't cold
Deal a nigga actin' like he won't roll back that concert till that 40 showed
Up! Put the bitch in the boat
Concierge said the cops are comin' up
Hurry wit' the racks and don't forget a cup
Nigga get stuck just like chuck, Band-Aid on Band-Aid
Put the lil bitch on the IG, now she think she done struck
Lil bitch, start a fan page
Put a hole in his jaw wit' a hole in the wall, ooh-ooh!
Shit! Lay it down, now the boy lost
My shoes havin' is the tightest, we stay high, nigga, kite us
My money long like a rifle, no one-shot, we not snipers
I wan' bust her like a bubble, bitch I'm chewin' now like a snuffle
When I bump from my racks, bitch I want a million ordered!
No shovel!

[Verse 2: Problem]
Milkin' these hoes, balcony flows
Colder than how I be doin' my hoes
Conference my shooters, I'd read' to expose
That most of these rappin' ass niggas is hoes
Yeah and your bills I just spent on my clothes
Trustin' my bros 'fore I listen to hoes
Fuck these bitches, but I still wanna fuck these bitches
And that's on my mama though
Bought it brand new, yeah, the mileage low
You claim you hood but that's comical
Bands on bands, that's logical, money nigga
Drug dealer, he's cheaper but my drugs realer
She's a rat but I fuck wit' her
She's hush while I hush wit' her, shhh
Quiet, bitch, 'fore a nigga cause a riot out
Never was no love, valentine take a motherfuckin' timeout
Still motherfuckin' white on the table
Tell my killers go and sniff a line out
And drop a baby mama, drop a nigga drawers
Fuck that till them motherfuckers timeout
