[Pre-Hook]
I call lil mama Makaveli she gon' ride with me
Mama booty thick as some bread I need some thighs with it
I'ma hold on to all that ass and I'ma die with it
I'ma snake inside this grass and I'ma survive with it
I ain't never had a problem I'm tryna tie with it
I couldn't afford a pair but I can bike ride with it
I'm like 'Ed, Edd n Eddy' baby I try with it
Now all them diamonds going splash, pussy dive in it

[Hook]
And I want her ass cause she hot no Clay
She got a nigga sitting inside all day and
She make a nigga find her somewhere to stay
When she get mad she moving in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passing New Orleans

[Interlude]
My P.O. tripping and shit man
So I can't smoke so I'm just drinkin the fuck out this drink you know
Popping them motherfucking Percs nigga
No Xans, no downers nigga we up
Fuck you mean

[Verse 1]
Baby girl know that I'm a king
Hustle hard, million views without a machine
I just might marry that little bitch and call her my thing
Marry her two times the way she suck on my d-ding
Put her out the house and make her leave all of the things
I bought her, I caught her cheating with a nigga such a stalker
But I don't give no damn cause she mine yes I bought her
I pull up in the Lamb after school pick up her daughter
Every time she get mad she acting like she don't remember
She don't remember nothing good but she remember tenders
She remember they hopped on that wood and caught a splinter
She remember that time when they cooked me that TV dinner
She remember that time every time I snuck in the house all late
And I remember the time when she was serious she'd never play
Damn how you know bro
Got a new ho sat butt ass naked right in front of nigga stove
Nigga money stacked up like Ludacris afro
Got a hundred hoes I lie to like I'm Pinocchio
When they say they bout to leave I'm like baby don't leave
I'ma run it up even if it come down to selling weed
I'ma stack them big bucks, yes I want that Chuck E. Cheese
I want them Ms no Mickey D's
Then I bounce back on them
I'ma catch a bitch and make her bite like a piranha
She gon suck that dick and spray all over her all summer
I used to be broke and now they coming by the bundle
Take her on the date and then I cut her like a barber
Pull up on the fair with a bale of them birds
Piss on your bitch mouth like it's a curb
Cartier swag on my face, no nerd
I don't like talk bro tell em no words

[Bridge]
Officer...
Save me
I'm gone, so gone off a Perc
I done went from rapping to reggae

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hottest baby blaze me
Akeem mink no '80s
Grown money so you can't age me
Gators on my feet got scabies
Hundred thousand hoes on my Avi
I'll send that pussy boy to Grady
I'll leave them pussy niggas skimpy
God, why'd they get me started?
Quan said he riding with four choppers no Harley
I'm known for drawing on the plugs yes arson
I'ma put them bitches in they place so then they barking
Mama had me inside of a store cause I'm the Target
Baby you still sucking cheap meat, it's like a market
I got a spot in Dunwoody with a WD Arthur
Bird told me these pussy niggas gon try to murk me but umm

[Refrain]
I call lil mama Makaveli, she gon ride with me
I call lil mama Makaveli-veli-veli-veli
I call lil mama Makaveli, she gon, she gon
I call lil mama Maka-Maka-Makaveli-veli

[Hook]
And I want her ass cause she hot no Clay
She got a nigga sitting inside all day and
She make a nigga find out somewhere to stay
When she get mad she moving in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passing New Orleans

[Verse 3]
Chopper City!
Fuck a Gates we chop that bitch, lil boy you tripping
I'm the realest nigga Notorious BIG
First I kill you boy and then I make your bitch suck dick
Suck that dick lil bitch, cuff that, spit lil bitch
Swallow that nut lil bitch, shit it out when you shit
I'm a creature, I'm amazing
Sit on that wood like you just walked inside a gymnasium
And your bookin' while I’m acein'
Playing games on my turf you got to be a gangsta
I hope you ain't doing nothin' boy you a wanksta
You should know you want beef with Thugger gon cater
You should know that these Bloods gon be the waiters (soo-woo)
Hundred S double M’s
Hundred motherfucking whoadies
Hundred motherfucking ganstas
Hundred motherfucking troops
Hundred thousand of my people
Hundred thousand Pirus
Hundred thousand geeked monsters
Hundred thousand no bullshit
Better know what you're doing before you do it
Cause when I pull up I'ma let it loose I'm not pursuing
I'm a motherfucking gangsta nigga know I have 'em right
As Kurt no Angle I'ma slap him with the banger
First I got the money then the power, no ranger
Just because you don't see me don't mean that I'm a stranger
Twenty thousand dollars on a smile no anger
I'm a beast bitch you can not tame me
