[Intro: Skypadwar]
Hey, I'm a product, you can order me
It's Audemars, Gucci, and Louie V
Them hoes used to throw up, now them bitches swallow
I used to drink shots, now it's out the bottle

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Skypadwar)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Okay)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (War)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 1: Skypadwar]
I bossed up on 'em when I copped the coupe
And opened up their eyes when I dropped the roof
I ain't Rick Ross, but I'm a fuckin' boss
I told her she could ride if she gave me mouth
But she gotta hurry up, cause we headed South
And she gotta do Thug if I switch the route
They say I'm bougie 'cause I travel with my Louis bag
But when I reach, I take my Gucci out my Louis bag
New boss, y'all out, vetoed
I'm transferrin' money from my evo
New house, so I'm lookin' through the peephole
'Cause ain't nothin' s'posed to be here but the kilo

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
No homo, but we balls on y'all
I fell to the sky, call it a skyfall
No, we do not fall, we are not y'all
We go the hardest, ROC crew smartest
New condo, I can see Madison's garden
And I'm in the 4 with the green, no Rick Marvin
Now I got to work for the fiends, no more starvin'
No more starvin, Marvin
I'm ridin' this beat like it's taking me to a million
They gonna take me to prison, 'cause I made a killin'
10 racks on me, my whole money, no written
And if you try to take it, you'll be left with no ceilings
Shoot him in the chest several times, that's no feelings
Shoot the fuckboy from the upstairs, still no feelings
If he fuck up with the money, no more dealings
Still fuck with white boy, shouts out to Willie
Your bitch in the condo suckin' on all us (all us)
She'll be suckin' on all us
She's an anteater, she's just suckin' on all us
(And what if we skeet?)
So just swallow this dick

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Capokam)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Capo)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 3: Capokam]
Okay, now hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band
And fuck them haters, they ain't shit, 'cause they ain't got a plan
I got a vision for the paper, y'all just think I'm playin'
Life bigger than what you see but y'all ain't even carin'

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Capokam)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all (Okay)
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Let's go)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Okay)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 4: Capokam]
Straight off the top, I can name niggas that really bitches
But Corey got the beat runnin', so no time for snitches
Now that I'm on, I can get you all off like light switches
Now I ain't switchin', I'm just tellin' you how it is
Most of my niggas died, but they never got to live
I do this shit for us, let's go

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Outro: Young Thug]
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I call on y'all
I ever fall, I fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
Too straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now I'm so straight I'm gonna fall on y'all
We out
