You can never never bash me
You can't ever say you laugh at me
You ain't ever ever hot G. (?)
You can never never match me
With that rollie, nigga skate up on it
That my baby, that my centerfold
That my baby, man, she never leave
Y'all now hanging with my kinfolks
She want everything I know, I know
She got Chanel purchase by the load/long. (?)
She wants the purse in the US. (?)
She wants that purse with the LeSport. (?)

I spoil you
I adore you
I give you everythin' you want
That's what I'm tellin' you
(that's what I'm tellin' you)
That's what I'm tellin' you
(what I'm tellin' you)

I let you wild out in the foreign car
That's what I'm tellin' you

And Imma let you be the dog, let you fuck the dog
I'm very loyal

It's been personal. (?)
And it ain't nothing personal

(Hey, yeah)

I gotta foreign outside
Just asked, she replied
She don't know when'll be tired
She wanna ride the dick the whole time
I know howaboutcha ball the Balmains
Gotta compensate her whole life
Get the sentence inside a suit and tie. (?)
Take the booty...

...we all the time
Aaayyyy

Imma see inside my waters so I tell you the time. (?)
I'mma king, I'm wait right here for my rock/ride
I like pretty people, with pretty feet, and real things
At least it feel like the truth when it's a lie, lie, lie, liee
I see a lotta pretty people not sure and "lie, lie" to me .... (meal) (?)

I spoil you
I adore you
I give you everythin' you want
That's what I'm tellin' you

That's what I'm tellin' you
