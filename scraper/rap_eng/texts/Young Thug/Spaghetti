[Intro: Young Thug]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Metro Boomin]
Metro, that's my muhfuckin' bro
We got these little bitches jumping like toads
I spent a hundred on my wrist and it's froze
I'm screaming "I won!" cause my neck look like a trophy
BURR! All in my ear
No chill, but I pop a pill
Metro, he up like a Lear
Don’t cry cause I won’t fuck your tear
Hey!
Wait! Don't nut till I come up out ya butt!
I got your bitch and would like some head
Can't hurt me like I cut off all my nerves
911, where is Wyclef nurse
Wearing Balmain when I pull up on ya
He don't know nothing, you might as well
Call it quits, say sorry, yeah
Hot boy but my neck look like a cooler
I'ma burn his ass like an overcooked strudel
I'ma pull up on him in a Hummer with his baby mumma
I’m the Band Camp like I’m Adrien Broner
I'm sitting up high, I'm in the nosebleed
I pour out the pint, don’t drink no O-Z
I'm a dinosaur B, but fuck your OG
If you bring me 40, you get a whole B
Pussy nigga, I'm bangin' Blood, but I'm livin' like royal
They suckin' and they fuckin' but I want my cash back
CB, they ain't loyal
I'ma Ca$h Money Brother, CMB/YSL, we the shit like a toilet
Say L-O-A-D-I-N-G
Motherfucker, we loaded

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, aye
I want me spaghetti like meat ball, ahh (I want some spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like meatball, wahh (woah, I want spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like a meatball, aye (want some spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like a meaty ball (SPAGHETTI!!)
I want some spaghetti, I'm bleeding like Freddy
I want some spaghetti, I want some spaghetti
I hope that you're ready, you might get discouraged
I'm bleeding like Freddy
I'm bleeding like Freddy
I'm bleeding like Freddy Krueger
I'm bleeding like a bitch (bleeding)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'ma eat it up like chow, baby
I'ma drive that young girl brazy
I designed her in the latest
Pussy tighter than a baby
Nigga been like my persona
I'ma cash out on my mama
I'ma cash out on my father
Then I'm gon' cash out on my brothers
I'm looking like suck on my Milky Way
Her natural hair look like a doll head
I make it rain, she got that fall head
I make her wet, I got that stall head
Wait, don't bite that dick, don't want no shark head
I got that gas but you can't park here

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, aye
I want me spaghetti like meat ball, ahh (I want some spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like meatball, wahh (woah, I want spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like a meatball, aye (want some spaghetti)
I want some spaghetti like a meaty ball (SPAGHETTI!!)
I want some spaghetti, I'm bleeding like Freddy
I want some spaghetti, I want some spaghetti
I hope that you're ready, you might get discouraged
I'm bleeding like Freddy
I'm bleeding like Freddy
I'm bleeding like Freddy Krueger
I'm bleeding like a bitch (bleeding)
Yeah
