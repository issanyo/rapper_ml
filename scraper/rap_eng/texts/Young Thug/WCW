[Hook: MPA Duke]
Smokin', kickin' shit, fuckin' bitches with my niggas
Got a hundred, whole round, bitch you cannot take no pictures
Magazine in the 30 round, you gon' get your issue
Don't come around me, when nigga's pop, I don't got no feelings
I fucked your WCW
And I swear I don't love her
Fucked her on top of the covers
Know I had to use a rubber
Diamonds on me and they're custom
Soon as we spot 'em we rush 'em
I got more rhymes than Busta
I had the grind, had the hustle
Now I got muscle

[Verse 1: MPA Duke]
Thugger, he poured up a four, I said gimme a shot
Came from the bottom, went straight to the top
Went through the struggle, I came from the block
Now I'm on top, a young nigga got guap
I'ma keep goin' and I'm never gon' stop
Rockin' the stage and we sellin' 'em out
We out the street, how the fuck we gon' fly?
Book you a show, it gon' cost a whole block
Caught tryna rob and you're gonna get popped
Know you heard 'bout me sendin' them shots
These niggas, they hatin', they watch and they plot
Got mine out the mud and it came out the pot
Flyin' on in, I don't fuck with no thots
Don't have to show 'em cause they know what we got
This is our year, you know we on fire
YSL shit, bitch you know what we 'bout

I got more rhymes than Busta
I had the grind, had the hustle
Now I got muscle

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
If you play, I'ma bust 'em
And my diamonds so brazy
They go crazy, they're custom
I'ma stay big like a buzzer
Put that check on your head like a Muslim
Fuck her real good like I love her
Fuck her real good like no other
Tee top ridin' in a drop, nigga stop, shop
AKs fillin' up the spots, nigga, black ops
Serve a lot, mothafuck the cops, nigga what you got?
Red beams cover your whole body like the chicken pox
I'ma make her ride inside my ride
She my main bitch? Oh yeah she lied, she my side
And I got more karats than a bunny, Clyde
No transmission, bitch, I'm never slippin', slide
You dig that?

[Bridge: Shad da God]
Cut
Trappin' out the dresser
Had them hoes in the SUV and Sprinter bus
Bitch say that they got in on a perc then we can't touch her
God pop that A3333 'fore I bust her
When I slang that mothafucka
Cut

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Remember me from that trap shit?
When I was knee high with a 3-5
Expensive denim and exotic leather
Nigga I ain't ever wore Levi
One hunnid, we solid
Real nigga forever, gon' be there regardless
You don't ever break the code, nigga
And never go against your partner for no ho, that's some fuck shit
They were teachin' pimpin', now we're masterin' the subject
They say the early bird get it, fuck who ain't up yet
Fuck is you mean? Fuck nigga you lookin' for me?
I be
