Slime

[Chorus]
Fuck nigga playin' 'round, young nigga hopped out and went ran down on 'em
Hit right between cars, then I went ran down on 'em
Apologies not sorry nigga I'm gon' run down on you
Aye, playin' 'round? I ain't playin' 'round, nigga run down on 'em
He gon' get hit up, don't let up
Fuck around and hit up, don't let up
I just put a shark on, land
Fuck around and put up, get wet up
Hey, hands up, hands up!
Nigga don't let up, let up
I'm not playin' around
I ain't gon' let up, let up

[Verse 1]
Mama got a house on [?]
Gotta get some money for ya dad's sake
Pull off in a Lamb, I'm laughing
SKRRRRTTTT, 2k
We ain't fallin' out 'bout hoes
We ain't gotta wear each others clothes
Young nigga came out the south
Only thing we gotta do the same is go
Nigga get beat like Nitti
I'ma turn up these bitches
New habitat, we living
So real, they thought they were [?]
Still got a bag [?]
Still tryna serve y'all folks
Still fuckin' all y'all hoes
Y'all ain't gon' do nothin', bro
Niggas ain't gon' play crazy
We gon' come and shoot, we ain't lazy
Ain't gotta prove to you, baby
Play, and we comin' like the Navy
I think I bumped my head as a baby
We ain't never shooting, we spray it
And I'm boutta lose these babies
Bitch roll, no Mercedes

[Chorus]
Fuck nigga playin' 'round, young nigga hopped out and went ran down on 'em
Hit right between cars, then I went ran down on 'em
Apologies not sorry nigga I'm gon' run down on you
Aye, playin' 'round? I ain't playin' 'round, nigga run down on 'em
He gon' get hit up, don't let up
Fuck around and hit up, don't let up
I just put a shark on, land
Fuck around and put up, get wet up
Hey, hands up, hands up!
Nigga don't let up, let up
I'm not playin' around
I ain't gon' let up, let up

[Verse 2]
Dropped out in 9th Grade, went and got money like nine ways
Bitches say they wan' fuck me and suck me for crying sake
Hands up, nigga better have his hands up, nigga, like all day
Playin' round, get left around, nigga hashtag, needa die today
Pay the investigator, beat us a grande
Now he back home, gettin' his stand on, he ain't said none, gotta lie, hey
Done day, YSL on a [?]
Choppa make a lotta sound, hey
Pockets full, nigga, pound cake
[?] that's my round, hey
[?] where ya son? Hey
Big house, got slime gates
Perfume on a Sunday
Beautiful like Sean Kingston
Draw down, and they all leavin'
Bell ringin' like a busy bee
I ain't pressed, so she feelin' me

[Chorus]
Fuck nigga playin' 'round, young nigga hopped out and went ran down on 'em
Hit right between cars, then I went ran down on 'em
Apologies not sorry nigga I'm gon' run down on you
Aye, playin' 'round? I ain't playin' 'round, nigga run down on 'em
He gon' get hit up, don't let up
Fuck around and hit up, don't let up
I just put a shark on, land
Fuck around and put up, get wet up
Hey, hands up, hands up!
Nigga don't let up, let up
I'm not playin' around
I ain't gon' let up, let up

[Outro]
Don't let up
Don't let up, don't let up, don't let up
