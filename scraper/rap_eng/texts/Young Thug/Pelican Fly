[Hook]
You're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly
Baby, you're pelican, fly, oh yeah, you're pelican, fly
Oh yeah you're pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god

[Bridge]
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Thug the bomb like propane, aye
40k the price for bricks a day, aye
Niggas know I'm runnin' off, no pay

[Verse 1]
Black diamonds dancin', I'm night today
Thug built a teepee on the runway
No Falcon, but I see birds every Sunday
Magic city on a Monday, ayee
Throw a whole 50 on a bitch ass, ayee
Smoke a whole ounce of gas, ayee
Nigga drinkin' lean in E-class
Private flights, you gotta grind, you can't get it overnight
Lean, lean, mix the Sprite, the green or the red? I drink it straight
RIP to Pimp, C-C-C-C, I'mma drink you everyday

[Hook]
You're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly
Baby, you're pelican, fly, oh yeah, you're pelican, fly
Oh yeah you're pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god

[Bridge]
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Thug the bomb like propane, aye
40k the price for bricks a day, aye
Niggas know I'm runnin' off, no pay

[Verse 2]
Take off runnin' down the damn street
Take off runnin' with this 30
Ain't gotta say it, you know I believe
I don't give no damn 'bout what you say to me
That's a bad boy ridin' through the hood
Man I got a hood, I'm Trayvon good
My car got no hood, misunderstood
I nick-named your ho timber, she love the wood
I'm in my zone, can't find my way home
If everything ain't right, then something gone go wrong
Man they flooded Atlanta, RIP to the dome
No harmony, she gone bone cause she stoned

[Hook]
She pelican, fly, she pelican, fly, she pelican, fly
Yeah, she a pelican, fly, oh shit, she pelican, fly
Oh yeah she pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god

Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Thug the bomb like propane, aye
40k the price for bricks a day, aye
Niggas know I'm runnin' off, no pay
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Thug the bomb like propane, aye
40k the price for bricks a day, aye
Niggas know I'm runnin' off, no pay

[Outro]
Think I'm runnin', think I'm runnin', think I'm runnin'
