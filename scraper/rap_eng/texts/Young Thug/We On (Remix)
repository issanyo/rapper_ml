[Intro: Young Thug]
Yo, it’s Thugger
BDM, Ape Gang, Garci
Let’s get it!

[Hook: Garci]
Money all I know, all I know is I’ma get rich
We stackin’ all this paper, ain’t got no time for these haters
See her after my show, I’m probably gon’ roll out with your bitch
We don’t owe you niggas no favors, we ball hard like D. Waiters
Ay nigga we on, ay my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, all my niggas we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, look my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Fuck your couches, nigga we on, ay my nigga my nigga we on

[Verse 1: Garci]
Ay nigga we on
Look at that shit we doin’
We came a long way, we made it
Double E Hill with my nigga Meek Mill
Bitches throwing me the pussy like a young nigga famous
Same mu’fuckers used to claim that they love me
Be the same jealous mu’fuckers sitting back hatin’
Mmm-mmm-mmm, real niggas relating
Don’t blow my high, mu’fucker I’m faded
Ay nigga I’m faded, yeah I’m faded
Percs and lean got a young nigga leaning
Everything I say just know that I mean it
I’m really out here, I be serving Serena
Pull up in your city like nigga you see us
Pull off in the block like skkrt in the Beamer
Riding through these streets in the whip so dirty
Know that whip so dirty still that bitch be the cleanest
Bitch fuck you, meet us
All this fur I got on, somebody call PETA
In a brand new two seater with two divas
Just spent two thousand dollars just on my sneakers
And you haters y’all can keep hating but y’all can’t reach us
Nigga we on

[Hook: Garci]
Money all I know, all I know is I’ma get rich
We stackin’ all this paper, ain’t got no time for these haters
See her after my show, I’m probably gon’ roll out with your bitch
We don’t owe you niggas no favors, we ball hard like D. Waiters
Ay nigga we on, ay my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, all my niggas we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, look my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Fuck your couches, nigga we on, ay my nigga my nigga we on

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Walk out a nigga's bitch spot like money's all I know
Turn around, drop it down, and give it to my bro
Willy got ones, the stripper bankroll gon' grow like Pinocchio nose
In a condo in New York with a mink on like a nigga sellin' that dope
New coupe, drop the roof, hoop, oh
Damn, stoned, uncle shoot, what up bro?
Nigga got hoes on deck, seven [?] on deck
Put the dick in her with a wrestling move
Pick her up then drop her on the neck
Ooh, here it comes, I hope you can catch
If you can’t catch, doesn’t mean let it fall
If you do bitch I hope you can fetch
God damn, woah woah, nigga money went up, ketch’ (ketchup)
I hope you get that ‘cause I don’t because

[Hook: Garci]
Money all I know, all I know is I’ma get rich
We stackin’ all this paper, ain’t got no time for these haters
See her after my show, I’m probably gon’ roll out with your bitch
We don’t owe you niggas no favors, we ball hard like D. Waiters
Ay nigga we on, ay my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, all my niggas we on, ay nigga we on
Nigga we on, look my nigga we on, ay nigga we on
Fuck your couches, nigga we on, ay my nigga my nigga we on
