[Intro: Future]
Freebandz Gang, that's a cash gang
That's a boss gang, shoot up everything, yeah
That's a boss gang, that's a killer gang
Killer, killer, woo, woo

[Chorus: Doe Boy]
I be walkin' in Givenchy, broke nigga miss me
Got your thotty tryna kiss me, she seen that Bentley
My young nigga servin' chickens, get a ten piece
You ain't talkin' 'bout no figures, nigga miss me
You not gang, you not with me, do you dig me?
Got a rod with that semi, racks I got plenty
Nigga said he gon' get me, broke boy that's risky
Niggas gossipin' like bitches, they talk like Wendy

[Verse 1: Doe Boy]
Got an iced out burr and that bitch white gold
When you're gang then I'm sharing, you can get my poles
Okay hold up, all my young shooters lift your poles up
All my trap niggas turn your stoves up, okay hold up
Never see you in your hood, no that's not where you're from
Put them fifties in the glizzies, we gon' slide then you're done
In the Bentley, I'm in traffic, bitch I'm riding with my gun
Ain't no chicken, I ain't aiming, ain't no thighs with this drum
Uppin' this extension, step on my Givenchy
Ridin' with that semi, I don't talk like Wendy
I been pourin' up this dirty, red got me trippy
Leave a hater with that angry face like my Fendi

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Rock Chanel with the Fendi, speaking of Fendi
Shoot the F off a Fendi, you niggas envy
Swear to God right now I just took off a Hercules
I got dogs with me now but most of my niggas in Cleveland East
Got a new slime chain and that bitch just ride in Rolls
I got shots, I got thots, place my balls in Kenneth Coles
I got good Mall of America on my wrist, suck my toes
Bitch that's weather, change the motherfucker right from ice to cold
Patty cake, patty cake
In the kitchen cooking, I couldn't wait
I'm out the way, I give up space
I can never have her go for a rate
I will never slow it down, catch the rate
I put Rollies on the inside the plates
Watch yourself when you're eating
You just might eat a karat, ayy

[Verse 3: Future]
Yeah, dress in new Givenchy, I got the semi
Drag race the Lamborghini, this not a hemi, ayy
Strapped up with the police, they like the old me, ayy
Bitch suck me so long, she done caught a nosebleed, ayy
I been on this drink, shit this lean on me shit, yeah
I done popped a bean, man I can't eat shit, nah
Pull up east of Cleveland, I'm in a Rolls Royce, yeah
All my niggas shooters, they got the polls out, yeah
Lil one caught a body, he want another one now
Yellow bandana, you need to be cautious, yeah
I popped one more Tesla, I was in a Ferrari
I got blue diamonds on, Snoop Doggy

[Chorus: Doe Boy & Young Thug]
I be walkin' in Givenchy, broke nigga miss me
Got your thotty tryna kiss me, she seen that Bentley
My young nigga servin' chickens, get a ten piece
You ain't talkin' 'bout no figures, nigga miss me (miss me)
You not gang, you not with me, do you dig me?
Got a rod with that semi, racks I got plenty
Nigga said he gon' get me, broke boy that's risky
Niggas gossipin' like bitches, they talk like Wendy (let's go)
