[Intro]
All my niggas across the world
We broadcasting live from Atlanta G.A

[Chorus]
Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like pass me the torch
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but aye aye bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to 2 cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get 2 cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

[Verse 1]
L-E-A-N-I-N-G
Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean lean lean
500 horses inside my machine
500 DNAs in my ding ding
Come here bitch, what you chasin' cash?
2 guns up, Ferrari smash
100 pound green, herbie kerbie, trash
Smoke a whole ounce, leave ya bitch the ash

[Chorus]
Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like pass me the torch
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but aye aye bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to 2 cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get 2 cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

[Verse 2]
AR 15 inside my trench
Plus I blend in with the fuckin' trenches
100 crushed diamond for my fuckin' misses
Take the bitch shoppin' cause I fuckin' missed it
Ralph Lauren boxers every day and night
Bitch, I ain't Barry, but I play with white
Bitch, I ain't scary, I could never fright
100 black choppers like a fuckin' night

[Chorus]
Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like pass me the torch
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but aye aye bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to 2 cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need 2 cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get 2 cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

[Outro]
Thugga, Thugga, baby
