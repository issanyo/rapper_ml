[Intro: Lil Duke]
This that real shit, you know
Ah

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
So many niggas turned they back on me
That's why I keep that strap on me
Flyin' in a falcon, B
I stay high like a balcony
Countin' these numbers like 90, bitch, you wanna hassle me
Leava after the show and they runnin' right after me
She suckin' my dick and she just wanna pamper me
She throw that ass like you know I'm gon' handle it
Can't go trustin' these bitches that scandalous
She say she love me, "Baby you're so talented"
I'm so in love with the money, I married it
Pull up and hop out the Lambo, they starin' now
Yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I told shawty the bag comin'
I hit the ground with that bag runnin'
And I'm still screamin' "Free Yak Gotti!"
He comin home, he ain't ran or nothin'
I sit my trunk on some meek katanas
He got a bitch with a bad body
Shawty bad, I put a bag on it
Shawty bad, I spend a bag on it, yeah
See the street like Sonya
Bae, keep callin', see ain't home, never
Money ten feet tall, she want me now
And I still go AWOL on that nigga and his homies now (go AWOL)
I just put some diamonds in her plane jane rollie
I just put some icey on all of my woadies (fancy)
I just put some pack in the street, nigga rolled it (facts)
But I can't give none to you 'cause I heard you ratted bruh

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
So many niggas turned they back on me
That's why I keep that strap on me
Flyin' in a falcon, B
I stay high like a balcony
Countin' these numbers like 90, bitch, you wanna hassle me
Leava after the show and they runnin' right after me
She suckin' my dick and she just wanna pamper me
She throw that ass like you know I'm gon' handle it
Can't go trustin' these bitches, they scandalous
She say she love me, "Baby you're so talented"
I'm so in love with the money, I married it
Pull up and hop out the Lambo, they starin' now
Yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I'ma get money, won't back down
Keep makin' mum and dad proud
Break on the car and just pack down
They say I get money, don't know how to act
My bitch know I'm fly like a private jet
Say we don't fly nothin' but them private jets
I don't wanna fuck, baby, I just want me some neck
On the grind, I'm tryna get me a check
I tell her all her time she is amazin'
I just might need that pussy, got me cravin'
And she know she wanna have my lil' babies
I can't explain how I get dangerous
We takin' flights out to Vegas
We screamin' fuck you know you gotta pay me
And we all for the takin'
Percocets, Henny, she got me faded

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
So many niggas turned they back on me
That's why I keep that strap on me
Flyin' in a falcon, B
I stay high like a balcony
Countin' these numbers like 90, bitch, you wanna hassle me
Leava after the show and they runnin' right after me
She suckin' my dick and she just wanna pamper me
She throw that ass like you know I'm gon' handle it
Can't go trustin' these bitches that scandalous
She say she love me, "Baby you're so talented"
I'm so in love with the money, I married it
Pull up and hop out the Lambo, they starin' now
Yeah, yeah
Diamonds dancin'
Yeah, yeah
