I just wanna see you do your thing for this money
And I just wanna see you bust it open for me running
And I don't wanna see you by yourself keep it hundred
Watch me drop these bands on your life like its nothing

[Verse 1: Benzino]
Pick her up in that foreign
Round the city we tourin'
Pullin' up in that club pop that pain know its pourin'
Sparkle up in this bitch, fuck that rain nigga its pourin'
Save all that drama, and them games cause niggas ain't for it
V neck, Tattoos and you see that
.40 on my waist, just in case it happens to be that
You stood up so nasty in these streets niggas might relapse
You stood up so nasty in these streets niggas might relapse

[Hook: Snypa]
I just wanna see you do your thing for this money
And I just wanna see you bust it open for me running
And I don't wanna see you by yourself keep it hundred
Watch me drop these bands on your life like its nothing

Making million dollar plans on some million dollar shit

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Even though I count it fast like I got 12 fingers
I drop it on her like I got half of 12 fingers
Count it fast, his fingers slow thats that snail fingers
Left hand only for molly, don't no pale fingers

Gettin' twin nose piercings, no bull
She's a monster, and I'm her sponsor
And for them bands, she gon' hunt ya
And she green but she don't so I saw slow slow
And I keep that .40 so DK don't mean no solo
Chopppa with them balls, no spartan
So don't act like Martin or you end up in the garden

[Hook]

And I just wanna see you bust it open for me running
And I don't wanna see you by yourself keep it hundred
Watch me drop these bands on your life like its nothing
