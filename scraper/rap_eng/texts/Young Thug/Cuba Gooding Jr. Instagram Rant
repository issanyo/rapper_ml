thuggerthugger1: SLIMESEASON 111 ... OTW !!!! HAPPY C-DAY TROUP

cubagoodingjr: This is better than literally anything the Beatles ever put out

thefronk90: This sounds like a drunk deaf person on crack found some beats on YouTube and paid somebody to combine it with a children's song. Please go back to the crack house you came from with your tweaker dance moves and uncivilized superficial style and lack of brain cells. @thuggerthugger1

thefronk90: @cubagoodingjr Really. Fucking really?

cubagoodingjr: @thefronk90 how dare you insult thugga. I was in "Snow Dogs" and won't stand for this shit.

thefronk90: "Thugga" sounds like a joke name for a mentally ill dog. I saw snow dogs when I was little. I laughed about twice. Also the Beatles made music, not shit on a mic with someone elses lyrics for it to be autotuned and put on a track made by 3 other people that still sucks @cubagoodingjr @thuggerthugger1

cubagoodingjr: @thefronk90 fam, I SWEAR you finna make me catch a body. First off: Thug is an amazing rapper on a pure technical level, as well as being a great lyricist and stone cold G. And SECOND how DARE you speak ill of "Snow Dogs" which was the top grossing movie of the YEAR?!? The Beatles NEVER had a movie and NEVER had any songs as good as Thug

cubagoodingjr: @thefronk90 how many Oscars you have, punk? How many songs you have with Guwop, punk? Don't you EVER besmirch EITHER Thugga or My name again. Otherwise I won't be "showing you the money", I'll be showing you these fists ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯
