[Intro]
Sticky kush, sticky kush
Tell me your name

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Nigga have you ever dreamed?
I was the man and you a thing
One and two
Anytime I get mad, I can goodbye to you
God damn, who the hell let rats in the house?
King of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?
Houston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch
I'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse
We roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though
Suck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound
I lost a Lear, no bucks, still waitin' on that Bentley truck
Stop playin', lil bitty boy, you a duck
He ain't YSL, nigga, he ain't in the hut
I might stop by and let that little bitch lush
I pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus
Little nigga, you know what it was
You know what it is, you know what it does
I'm makin' your old lady shake it
She suckin' too slow, I'm impatient
My diamonds so wet like a basin
Don't know where to go, I'm amazin'

[Hook: Jacquees]
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? (Amazing is a grateful thing)
I might accept your apology
I mean you throw L's up if you ain't followin'
I am a beast, your life I'll be swallowin'
And I've been drinkin', I need to bottle this

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Man I'm so tired of these niggas man
I am so tired of these bitches
I'm so magnificent, studio workin'
I'm wearin' a top like I'm pimpin'
Your bitch want my milk
I'm sittin' at the top lookin' down at these wimps
These hoes just roll me a blunt
And you know that they stuff it, it cannot be imps
I never had cutlass and donks
I based up my bankroll then based out my trunk
I might fuck that lil bitch in the mornin'
I might put her out and call Tyrone
Snoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone
I'm big ballin', bitch put me inside the dome
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the tight way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the right way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the scary sight way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the goodnight way)
Take some sand to the beach
Party with a couple foreign freaks
Kim K lookin' hoe, Yeezy
Florida livin' nigga, Pork N Beans

[Interlude: Jacquees]
Yeah, and I'mma ride this bitch tonight
And I just might ride this bitch tonight
Pork N Beans where you at baby?
Pork N Beans where you at baby?

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Brown sugar on that bitch
Pull up with a hoe and she know I'm ready to
Bust her, pay her, leave her, fuck her
I don't wait up, hold up, let me check my mail
He broke, he servin' his squad with a scale
I make it rain, I hope all is well
I pull off deep like what in the hell?
Hoe give all my niggas some bails
Wait I'ma lay down 'fore I'll tell
Pull up in old school Chevelles
I don't save pictures, they might get revealed
How many times have I asked are you well?
How many times have I popped a perc pill?
How many homies at home on the bail?
How many times have I told you you shell?
How many meals have I ate until I burp?
Dropping the top on the Mulsanne ain't no hot top on merchs
Hey I worked so hard to get out that dirt
Hey I was thinking this is not that work
