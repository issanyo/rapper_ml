[Verse 1: Trapboy Freddy]
911, it's emergency
You better hurry, it’s a murder scene
I heard it's smoke up in the city, somebody gotta get it
Felon with a weapon, rather get caught with it
I got my eyes in my rearview, I'm checking my surroundings
Can’t let these fuck niggas around me
Fire alarms are going off, you see the sirens in the streets
Get you smoked like a pound of weed, livin' in the streets

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
It’s gon’ go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon’ go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out

[Verse 2: Trapboy Freddy]
In the club with my pistol on, you cannot search on
Bitch, we ride like surfboards, better yet, the DART bus
When it's time to go to war, you better pull that pole out
Empty the whole clip and you better not hold out
I’m downtown, we ridin' lowkey, I'm tinted up
Gotta watch my back, can't let one of these niggas pull up and beam me up
Can't believe my partner slippin', Oak Cliff sick as fuck
That was my last tear for this year, gotta go get me a nigga
Put a hundred guns on the street, let's go to war, I'm riding
Niggas movin' like Nemo the fish, you can't find him
We stayed down for this shit, grindin'
If they tell you otherwise, they lyin'

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No matter where I go, I gotta make sure I got smoke out
(When I hop out the car, keep that motherfucker on me right now, on God)
Yeah (Yeah), Pateks, Rolex, boogers in the stone, yeah
I'm ready for smoke like a black stone
We just knockin' heads off, gettin' them racks on
G-Wagon in your spot with no tags on it
Tinted windows and they come through the garage on 'em
And I can't get reception with this chop, chop, chop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They tracked it down and we gon' shoot up the block
If it's hard top then we convertin' the top (Yeah yeah)
How you can revive him without all his body parts?

[Chorus: Trapboy Freddy]
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
It's gon' go down if you want some smoke now
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out

[Verse 4: Trapboy Freddy]
Can't put that smoke out, gotta let it smoke out
No we can't hold out, no, you cannot roll now
I don't wanna talk now, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
These J's walk up in this bitch, I make 'em walk it out
Shootouts a hundred times, I ain't scared
Must ain't got an aim, I ain't dead
He should be ashamed for what he said
He should be ashamed for what he did
Every nigga with me gon' bust
I don't even gotta say nothin'
Better crawl low when it's smoke
Be at your door like Dominos
It's gon' be smoke, gotta let it go
It's gon' be smoke, gotta let it blow
