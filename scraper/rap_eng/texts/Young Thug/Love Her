[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Dun Deal on the track
Ay, ay, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ay

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
I say she in that finger pointing at me
She can get anything she want from daddy
Beauty pageant, boy my ho the baddest
These dark shades on, I got on, she don't know who I'm looking at
My main ho got a cute lil' kitty
And that's why I love her, love her, love her, love her
I swear I love her, love her, I love her (I swear I love you baby)
I love, love, love, love
L-O-V-E, I love, I love, love, she ready (You know I love you baby)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
L-O-V-E, small word but it get you hurt lil' nigga
Hit it from the back, make her squirt my nigga
Young nigga move that work my nigga
Walk inside the strip club, throw a lotta ones, make her twerk my nigga
Hit it from the back, make her hurt my nigga
Fuck her like a dog, make her hurt my nigga
Lean back, shooting like Dirk my nigga
Used to have her [?] my nigga
Still putting in that work my nigga
I'll hurt y'all niggas, I ain't muhfucking playing
Throwing up gang signs like I'm deaf, what the fuck is y'all saying
[?] I'm turning to tan
I'm taking orders out of a soccer van
Nigga acting like he want it, fuck around I'll pop your mans
Rich Homie Quan and YSL my fam
Big ol' minks, I feel like a fucking lamb

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
I say she in that finger pointing at me
She can get anything she want from daddy
Beauty pageant, boy my ho the baddest
These dark shades on, I got on, she don't know who I'm looking at
My main ho got a cute lil' kitty
And that's why I love her, love her, love her, love her
I swear I love her, love her, I love her (I swear I love you baby)
I love, love, love, love
L-O-V-E, I love, I love, love, she ready (You know I love you baby)

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Thug, I love you like my mother
Quan, I love you like my father
Thug, I love you like no other
Quan, I love you like my lover
Thug, we gon' be at it forever
Quan, we gon' be rich forever
Thug, tell me who we're better
Than us lil nigga
Nigga money longer than a bus lil nigga
Ear popping cause I'm at the top of the building
Threesome with your main ho, put her in the middle
Got a red Gucci backpack, no Skittles
Big ass softer than a muhfucking pillow
I'ma take off like a muhfucking missile
I was up early, no early than missus
Quan get 'em
I don't have sex unless the birthday cake in my face, hey
And I ain't tryna fuck unless she got big tits and a waist
And in the player club, I'll fuck around and blow up the whole place
I got money stacked to the ceiling, some more off in the safe
I say, I say, hey

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
I say she in that finger pointing at me
She can get anything she want from daddy
Beauty pageant, boy my ho the baddest
These dark shades on, I got on, she don't know who I'm looking at
My main ho got a cute lil' kitty
And that's why I love her, love her, love her, love her
I swear I love her, love her, I love her (I swear I love you baby)
I love, love, love, love
L-O-V-E, I love, I love, love, she ready (You know I love you baby)
