[Intro: Young Thug]
Wheezy Beats
Yeah
Yeah
Roast the weed one summer babe (You the GOAT)
Roll it as we celebrate, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rome Fortune]
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up (Hands up)
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up (Hands up)
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
Haha, better budge your budget
Group home for my new old buddies
My old old buddies got new homes and unlimited funding
I seen some things that'll make you question God, man
I hear my pain when I swipe my credit card, man
That's a whole lot of guap that I got on me
Shout out to my old chick, I gotta wait in Tennessee (Ayy, ah, ah)
If you gon' hate, then do it with some feeling (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
Fuck all that strugglin', like revelries, the deal is, huh

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rome Fortune]
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up (Hands up)
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up (Hands up)
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up

[Post-Chorus: Rome Fortune]
(Stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it)
A ho trust, think money ain't the issue
(Stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it)
A ho trust, think money ain't the issue

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
Popped up out of the dark
I'm gon' get it regardless of talk
I let 'em talk, got a lot on my heart
Doin' the wrong thing, it gave me a rush
Put the Porsche in park
They took my drip, I made my mop
It's okay, I get it, niggas is lost
Follow the leader again if you want
Hands up if you really a boss

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rome Fortune]
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up (Hands up)
If you, get that money, put your hands up
If you, blow that money, put your hands up (Hands up)
If you, stack that money, put your hands up
Pussy nigga, bet I stand up

[Post-Chorus: Rome Fortune]
(Stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it)
A ho trust, think money ain't the issue
(Stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it, stack it and get it)
A ho trust, think money ain't the issue
