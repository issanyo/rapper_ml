[Hook: Young Thug]
Cash talk, cash talk
Baby, you know I make my cash talk
Cash walk, baby you know I make my cash walk
Cash out, baby you know I brought that cash out
Cash out, baby you know I want that cash money
Cash money, and you I talk that cash money
Cash money, and know I want that cash money
Cash money, you I talk that cash money
I talk, I talk, I talk, I talk that cash money

[Verse 1: Figg Panamera]
I'm a Young Thug with an Offset
My team strong, we ain't lost yet
Taking trips on a boss jet
We counting money, it don't cost shit
We thumbing through it and I'm paranoid
Fillmoelanta that's a lot of boys
We smoking loud and that's a lot of noise
Thought it's Christmas time when they seen the toy
Taking my coat and my shoes off
Red bottoms, call them Rudolph
Red Jag with the roof off
With a red bitch with her boots off
Designer, designer, designer
And all of my diamonds be one of a kind(er)
Gucci be down from my head to my feet
It's cash involved and we all gotta eat
Pockets on swole when I'm rolling the ?
Cookies be stuffed in my blunt when I eat
She fucking with me, then she paying a fee
And she paying a fee, then we making some Gs
I don't think you, I do
Really wanna fuck with you
But I'd rather let that...

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I hit the club, I got them bands on me (racks)
We ain't getting searched, they ain't putting they hands on me
Young Thug gon' mac a ho, like ?
Her outfit tight like it's Saran on it...
Get her in the car and pop a pill
?
Make her play doctor, no Phil
MTV, how do I live?
She let me nut on her ribs
?
?
I'm beating my chest like a lion
?, now she the finest
Her booty colossal, colossal
Her waist look like she on a diet
I'm gon' chew you, I'm gon' chew you, chew you
I'm gon' chew you like Trident
I'm gon' do you, I'm gon' do you, do you
I'm gon' do you like violence

[Verse 3: Offset]
My niggas they talking 'bout money
Dubs, fifties, the hundreds
Smoking on gas, fungus
Hit a hundred-band juug on Monday
I'm kicking it with Bigga Figga, my nigga
You know we got bigger figures
My momma say "Go read a scripture"
Cause I be killing these pussy ass niggas
Motion picture, my nigga
We sipping on Actavis, good on the liquor (LEAN)
My niggas they too official, no whistle
These VVS diamonds my nigga, design, no crystals
These bitches they love a young nigga
They wanna take pictures, they wanna see visuals
I'm one of a kind, my diamonds gon' blind
My bitches are quarters, no dime
You catch me on BET watching, young nigga
My nigga, this ain't no Vine
More money than you and your niggas combine
My diamonds albine (bino)
No, I don't know you, you broke
My niggas move coke
On a boat!
