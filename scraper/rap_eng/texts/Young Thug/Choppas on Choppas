[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa:]
Young Khalifa got pounds in the trunk, fuck a none smoking son rolling up for the one
Imma rich nigga I don't walk through the front and I'm been getting paid so I don't really got to stunt
You don't get fly, you don't get stoned, you don't get high your bitch gave me dome
You don’t make 2 million off a tour dawg I’m just getting home
You don't got 2 or 3 bitches that’s better than muhfuckers sending them pics through your phone
You don't got kush in your cone, You don't got millions of clones
You don't get fresh and go way overseas with your name on a plane you just flown

I'm make a stain out you dissing no little shit that Imma aim at you man

[Chorus: Young Thug]
