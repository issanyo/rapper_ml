[Chorus: Young Thug]
Old English, 800 capsules of Molly
Just be very still, I ain't gonna hurt anybody
Hell nah, I ain't twelve, but if I like it I cop it
I met papi and he said he good at uploadin' wallets
Catch me ridin' with them slimes, them my youngins
Catch me boolin' with them slimes, them my youngins
I be slimin' with them slimes 'cause they my youngins
Catch me slidin' with the slimes 'cause them my youngins

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Chrissy Carter bezel inside my baby pampers, eww
I get off the work and let the J's snort the scale
My bitch ride slow with the yay like she get L’s
I wear that white, I cook that white, but I am not no chef
Add a little soda, put the tan on it
I got the shit for my L O and my shawty want it
I drink more mud than a pig, I think porky want me
And the front of the Mazzi look like a fork don't it?
Let it breathe
I'm not no rat but Young Thugger be chasing cheese
I want the M's and I’m not talking Micky D’s
My jewelry gold like the tokens at Chuck E. Cheese

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Old English, 800 capsules of Molly
Just be very still, I ain't gonna hurt anybody
Hell nah, I ain't twelve, but if I like it I cop it
I met papi and he said he good at uploadin' wallets
Catch me ridin' with them slimes, them my youngins
Catch me boolin' with them slimes, them my youngins
I be slimin' with them slimes 'cause they my youngins
Catch me slidin' with the slimes 'cause them my youngins

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin' with my youngin’s, couple hundred onions
Breaking down them 20’s what you need, we got it for you
Chop a chicken down to chicken nuggets for my cluckers
Spray that Cutlass, threw them Forgiato's on that motherfucker
Gangsta Gibbs ho'
Fresh up off a powder pack, solo on the ‘94, bitch I brought that powder back
Geekers do that zombie walk
Bitch, I let the chopper talk
Niggas get to talking, ch-ch-chop ‘em off like Tomahawks
Ch-ch-chop ‘em off like Tomahawks
Eight thousand capsules of molly
Yeah, selling dope, and robbing, momma I dropped out of college
Yeah, jumped off on this rap shit, I've been one hundred solid
Yeah, police ever catch me then they gon’ catch a body

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Old English, 800 capsules of Molly
Just be very still, I ain't gonna hurt anybody
Hell nah, I ain't twelve, but if I like it I cop it

Catch me boolin' with them slimes, them my youngins
I be slimin' with them slimes 'cause they my youngins
Catch me slidin' with the slimes 'cause them my youngins

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, ‘cause her momma got cancer
She can’t work in the states because her green papers ain’t legal
Fuck a "dame un beso", she be like "run de un peso"
Push the molly to Pedro, so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole
She can’t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo-lian
I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, there she get money vicarious off her friends though
Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando
She robbed Birdy for birdies now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy, and Birdy killed my Cuban ho...
