[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
You can keep all your fake love
Bitch fucking up my sheet with all that makeup
I still slide through the project to get my tape off
Im on a screw bout the only time I lay up
It's a bigger lead, bigger lead, oh yeah yeah yeah
Doin bigger things, bigger things, with all my motherfuckin' kids
I'm a bigger lead type of nigga boy, you gotta stack some more bread
It's a bigger lead, it's  a bigger lead, young nigga young nigga

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Skoob and Slime on the new ghost
Pimping strong still stuck on her like a Newport
I don't give no fucks bout God I play Kukoc
Play my position to get the millions shit like Judo

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I want some bands, some cash
I want some mags, some bags
Doin' my dance, yeah
Blow out your brains, yeah
I'm doing my thang, yeah
I'm killin' yo mane, yeah
They bring him back up from the dead
I do it again, yeah

[Verse 3: Trouble & Young Thug]
Why I treat these hoes like some straight mutts
I thought my dick gon give you shit, I caught a fake nut
Prolly didn't even hit the bitch, just got my sock blowed
They talkin' bout Trouble "you retarded" You know my top blowed
I got your bitch in La Parrilla eating taco
Wan' suck my dick while I blow on the other pothole
Thought you might be the plug, thought that she watching Narcos
She tried to tell a nigga 'bout the boy El Chapo
Yeah, turn her a freak, to be the freak of the week
She wet as a pool, with her friend shawty so cool
Dawg, I can't near make this hoe mine
Ain't no pussy that good, yo' fold-blind, shoulda
Hit it then pass it last
I'mma stretch it like elastic
I'm getting it fast
My diamonds they dancing, they dancing
These niggas so mad 'bout that
But ain't gon' do jack 'bout that
She got every bag again
She make 'em look bad, oh yeah

[Verse 4: Trouble]
I came through with bags again
Hoe niggas got mad again
I came to pick up my lil' cheddar
My grandma calling me [?]
I eat it, beat it altogether
[?] she freakin' like forever
Sheriff kinda heated like a kettle
It look like some beetles in ya bezels

[Verse 5: Young Thug & Trouble]
Slow speed, diamonds dripping on my motherfucking shirt
Pussy nigga play, they got the front row in the hearse
Dripping sauce on yo bitch, make her burp, thirst
Let it calm down then come back first
Bitch do yo bars for the YSL
Bitch don't kick her out, she might tell
I said don't kick her out the room, she might tell
I know that bitch well, she gon' tell someone they ain't gon' even give you a bail
And these niggas gon' tell
The fuck shit that they didn't ask, fact
Wondering what the hoe 'bout
Them folks shoulda been told to pack a mat
Yeah, shoulda kept it real, shoulda told 'em it was that
But since you ain't real nigga, you deserve to have jack

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
You can keep all your fake love
Bitch fucking up my sheet with all that makeup
I still slide through the project to get my tape-up
Im on a screw bout the only time I lay up
It's a bigger lead, bigger lead, oh yeah yeah yeah
Doin bigger things, bigger things, with all my motherfuckin' kids
I'm a bigger lead type of nigga boy, you gotta stack some more bread
It's a bigger lead, it's  a bigger lead, young nigga young nigga
