[Verse 1: Shakka]
I fuckin' told you before
Don't call me, don't call me
'Less you're in pain on the floor
Don't call me, don't call me
Only you made your choice
Turned your back on my voice
So why's your name on my phone?
Don't call me, don't call me

[Chorus: Shakka]
Call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Honey you, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Only you

[Verse 2: Shakka]
Your mom said more than hello
Cause we're talking, must have loved it
I paid attention and dough
I could hardly afford it
I was all you needed and more
All the signs I ignored
Still you made him your choice
Don't call me, don't call me

[Chorus: Shakka]
Call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Honey you, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Only you

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Do your thing, baby
Do your thing, baby, baby do your thing, baby
Yeah smoke out your brains, baby
Yeah, let's get stoned, do the same, baby
Tomorrow, yeah, and if you broke, bae you can borrow it
Yeah, I want you, baby no sorrow
I do this shit because I got it, oh
I got bitches with me, I got on a poncho
And I know you wanna beat it like brrrambo
Yeah but I got 'em sittin' up in the nosebleeds
You can't see 'em 'less you own a helicopter, oh
You throwed off, you should go and see a doctor, bro
I'm standin' up tall on my bankroll
One, two, three, make the crowd roar
Nigga, one, two, three, make the crowd go
Crazy

[Chorus: Shakka + Young Thug]
Call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Ayy Carnage, I got you, mothafucka
So why's, call me, back on my voice
I swear to God, nigga, you dig?
Win a gold and share an iced out AP, not the Rollie bezel, oh
Honey you, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
So why's, call me, back on my voice
Only you
