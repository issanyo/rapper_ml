Got some head in Minnesota, racks still load 'em (big racks)
Spendin' racks on weed and I don't have glaucoma (woohoo)
I'm flying 'em in and flying 'em out of Daytona (hey, hey)
She said she wanna fuck me, she like my persona (private plane)
Yeah, just to see, missin' my baby (my baby, yeah)
I wanna hit it, penetrate it (woo)
Trippin' out on a bean, baby want you wildin' out (Slatt)
I want you to hold that conversation, what the fuck you talkin' 'bout (Slatt)
Crayola, all the pockets filled with colors (hey)
I throw racks inside the Strokers and my diamonds blue like oceans
I just sprayed her with the lotion, I just did what I'm supposed to
Came a long way from the roaches, now ten thousand spent on sofas
We get it in, yeah we cash out Tesla Roadsters (Slatt)
When you gettin' it in, you can cash out when you wanna (woohoo)
I'm bad boy and I'm ballin' 'til I'm gone (bad boy)
And my friend was just drippin', you can smell it 'round the corner, yeah (slime)

[Chorus]
'Bout to squeeze the trigger, don't panic (damn)
