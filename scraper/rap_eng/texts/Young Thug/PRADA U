[Intro: Johnny Venus]
From the heart, from the heart this time
All of these dreams that you don't need true
All of these things you don't give too
Call on me, I'll carry you
There ain't no thing I wouldn't do
Lions, tigers, bears and all of these things
They could never come between me and you

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
We having designer sex, crawling on top of me
While I keep my timing yeah everything beating
Help you get your body breeze, conspiracy, yeah
Drip from my head to my sock and I'm whipping a new machine
I got the percocets, I got the guap
And I got me a cool nervous thing
She went to whipping it
Had to tell her "Lil baby I'm proud of you"
Flex your bank account without a salary
In this bank and this lettuce and radish due
Ima keep it clean in case I see you
She said "Babe, tell me how you missing but you never ride by
I got all little girlfriends" that is really cool
And I can tell you all the time

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
She put the Energizer batteries in my bank
I can eat PM brownish
Tell her how I feel, just like Harriet Tubman
Take me to feed 'em like Harriet Tubman
Pray for me even though I don't deserve it
Get off your knees and bend over and bust it
We nobody, get the poser, not business
TV's made it easier to have a discussion
Wow, wow, I'm so fucking proud
Keep taking backshots like that
Fuck around, give your ass a child
You are a keychain of colors
On me fireworks she fucking wild
I can see it now, I believe first
No bandwagon, no T-Shirt
Know you're going like a fucking meteor
Did you bring a friend? I ain't see her
Tell her digitally tryna keep her
Proud of you, I study you, I do the research baby
