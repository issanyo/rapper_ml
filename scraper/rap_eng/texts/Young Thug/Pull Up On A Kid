[Intro: Young Thug]
I know all my whips are foreign, I know all your bitches borin'
I know I gained me some weight when I was tourin'
Fresh and clean like a new born, I wet that bitch and then wet yours
I ride that beat with no insurance, what you tell 'em Thugger?

[Hook: Young Thug]
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, baby pull up on a kid (Skrr, skrr)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
You need to pull up a on kid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

Ooh she bad, damn she bad, yeah she bad, yeah

Balmain jeans, extended tee, that my swag, yeah
Bad bitch, know I'm loaded, so they taxing, yeah
Write it off, hold it, make her come back like she owe me
She know it, I tapped on that ass and she turn around and show it
Oh lord, moved down to Miami now she think she's Zoeing
They know her they taught her they showed her
Fresh as a peppermint, threesome like sandwiches
Almost couldn't handle it, I don't establish it
Popping these Xannies and Percs, I'm dranking that lean and I'm smoking that good
Told that little bitch I want to see her topless just like a hood

Minor setback for a major fucking comeback
Rap the fucking show, rock and roll, this a death trap
Playing with my slimes, you won't make it out the exit
Mr. Brazy Hoe (hoe), Mrs. Brazy Hoe (hoe)
Anybody get it, eenie-meenie-mo'
