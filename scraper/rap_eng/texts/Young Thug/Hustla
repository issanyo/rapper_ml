[Intro]
Goose wit another one

[Pre-Hook: Lil Duke]
Lil mama know she stuck with me
All she wanna do is pull up with me
Tellin' all her friends she don't fuck with me
You know that's a lie, she probably would die
If couldn't get in touch with me

[Hook: Freaky]
Lil mama know I don't trust her
I was in the streets, baby, know that I'm a hustler, yeah
Lil mama know I don't trust her
I was in the streets, baby, know that I'm a hustler, yeah
Lil mama know I don't trust her
I was in the streets, baby, know that I'm a hustler. yeah
Lil mama know I don't trust her
I was in the streets, baby, know that I'm a hustler, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, yeah
Ketchup, nigga mustard
All gold chains, no trinidad
Suck that dick like a sucker
Keep that flow no hustle
Take cameras, sisters and brothers
Diamonds still drippin', no flood
All my jewelry light like bud
I might catch a nigga down and beat 'em, and tell 'em it ain't you
And I swear that pussy fuckin' wild like a fuckin' acorn
And I'm alway frigid  with my brothers, fuckin' neighbors
I remark and (?) callin' my bar and what?
Suck that dick perfect, put it on her head
Quarters on head, lay up on my bed
I'm drinkin' easter pink, I'm a pig
Yes I'm livin' soo free, but I swear...

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
(what do they know?)
She know that she want me, she all on my bumper
Her face is soo cute and her ass is humongous
I'm still in the trap, and she know I do numbers
I could never love her, I do not wanna be number
I just wanted to get commas
I not guilty to your honor
I am soo gifted I'm wanted
We are soo dangerous we're armed
I just spent 10 on a charm
You cannot catch me, I'm gone
Broke bitches leave me alone
Opposite of off, I am soo on
I am the king, like a game ace of spades
Bitch, you know I'm gettin' paid, like 6, 7 ways
While you on the block makin' minimum wage
I work 'round the clock sittin' at the top and I'm gettin' face
