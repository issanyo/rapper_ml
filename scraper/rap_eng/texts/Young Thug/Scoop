[Intro]
I got a text message, from one of my new hoes. She say she gotta go to New York then after that she free...

Thugga...Thugger!

[Hook]
My lil mama say she know I stay G fresh (I'm G Fresh)
When I get home she lay on my chest like a vest (lay on my chest)
She like "I was so clean, but I'm a mess" (I'm a mess)
And I'm like "yeah you the best and that's a bet" (that's a bet)
I wanna go with you, you G fresh
She leavin' him for me like so what?
I'm coming for you like I'm a vet
I just might scoop up all of the rest

[Verse 1]
I might scoop her up like I'm a pooper scooper (scoop!)
I be like "girl stop playing, baby you know I knew ya"
I just might put my glasses on when I pursue ya
She got me going to church, now I say hallelujah
Bring that ass to the Thugger, bring that ass baby
And you know I see straight through that ass like glass baby
I turn into a monster without a mask baby (GAR!)
You know I'll be ya sponsor, I'll help you pass baby
Roley Roley, girl suck up my whodie
I am loaded, there's no need to show it
My trap spot rolling like rolley pollies (rollie rollie)
And I'll buy her a focus, cause she's focused (thugger!)
