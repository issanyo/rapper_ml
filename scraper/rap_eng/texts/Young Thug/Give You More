[Intro]
Aye, bring me the lighter, Slimeball
Rich Gang
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, hah
We got London on the track
Wooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I know grand larcen', I pull up with dogs and they biting, not barking
I am the king and I'm serving all white like a mo'fuckin' Porsche, and
Bitch you best not leave out the house with nothing, you know that I bought it
Even though that I'm not booling with Drake, bitch, you know that I started it
Loving this kush that I stuff in my face
Boy, I get my cookies straight from the Bay
How could your diamonds be real and you fake?
And I'm just tryna catch a seal with a bae (what?)
Ayy, ooh, do not get me started
No STD, but I'm runnin' my warden
I'll get you killed just because I'm important
I don't wan' go back and forth, no seas, ho (I don't wanna)
Momma lips are so big, she suck my whole team off (suck it off)
Ayy, I'ma pass that bitch around without my hands, dawg
Hand in my third strike like a standoff

[Chorus]
Baby girl, I can get it, I can give you more
He can give you this, but I can give you more
Baby girl, I can get it, I can give you more
He can give you this, but I can give you more

[Verse 2]
Pimping these bitches just look at my hashtag
Dropping these niggas dead, read all my hashtags
I just spent like four bands on that Celine bag
I just bought lots of saran for my new minivan
Boy, your bitch just text me "Yes" and she ain't gon' tell you
Ayy, ever since I ran up my bands, I've been actin' too rebellious
Your lil bitch say you're the one, she be my treasure
She wanna be in my life, I ain't gon' never let her
Never, never
She won't never wanna leave, no
I think I seen her in all my dreams, no
Baby, I'ma fucking OD (never)
I can buy you shit like it's your B-day

[Chorus]
Baby girl, I can get it, I can give you more
He can give you this, but I can give you more
Baby girl, I can get it, I can give you more
He can give you this, but I can give you more
