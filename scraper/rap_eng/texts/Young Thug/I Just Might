[Hook]
I just might spend a whole milli (racks)
I just might throw to the ceilin' (c-note)
I just might spend a lil' dub today
I just might spend a lil' twenty
I just might spend a lil' million
I just might fork up a billion
I just might come out there broke today
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hunnas
I might just turn to a stunna (sheesh)
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a hunter
I might pull up in a Honda
I just might get to these riches
I might go broke with these bitches

[Verse 1]
Whippin' the dope, ride the pot like a peg
Nigga got the whole rock under my feet, no Pro Ked
These bitches like when I go crazy, I swear I go crazy like spazz
Nigga could never be none of you, never ever, you're not it
Consider our street soldiers, run with the wooly
Lil' Mexico lingo lingo
Yes I got a will, but you're not included
All because you're not cutthroat (slime)
Yes I got bales in the pantry
Yes I got pounds in the attic
I don't like you
Yes I'ma turn my head on you like you a lil' faggot
If I ever take a trip to the chain gang you know they embracin' lil' homie
The warden on me, they pourin' on me
You think it's a dream, you blurry on me
My skin is tatted, you can tour on it
Matter fact you can explore on it
You should go down on your numbers, my nigga
You overexaggeratin', plural on it

[Verse 2]
I just might, I just might, I just might, I just might
I just might, I just might think that I'm [?]
I dive in the sky, I really believe I can fly
I be like "Hurry and buy"
I fucked 'em both I'm connivin'
I'm an angel in the sky
I look down on the drive by's
Hundred bands inside of my pants
YSL loaded
I don't like gold jewelry no more
Put it up like a trophy, I'm the coldest
Smell like flowers, she's the bomb
I just call her "Lotus"
Dick get hard on her butt
My nickname "Hokus Pokus"
