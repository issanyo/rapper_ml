[Hook: Lil Duke]
My country boy’s on the way, I’m finna serve him
I want you to hold this K, and don’t act nervous
Them goons around me, and they working
We getting them birds in, and that’s for certain
He claim that he a boss but he never took a loss
Playing both sides, that’s that shit that’ll get your ass offed
Got some shooters on a budget, they’ll kill your ass for nothing
Run up on you with that carbon, 40 clip into his noggin
They vicious

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Your bitch is naked washing dishes
She like my lifestyle, she say we live too religious
Two thousand for my gators, them bitches look itchy
Bitches got bumps, and I’m rich like Donald Trump
Driving around with that pump, pockets look like a lump
Weed smelling like skunks, blunts big as a stump
Bitches wan’ fuck Young Thug and they wanna fuck on Duke, uh
Thugger not with the bullshit, baby I just want fun
Boolin’ out in the [?] baby, I came up off midget
Now we not getting pulled over but my whole crew got them tickets
Baby I’m YSL, I’d love to come to the funeral
No I’m not no physic but I got powers just like Yugi-oh

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I’m in the front of the line like the motherfuckin’ hearse do
I know Thugger killed verse one, I’m ‘bout to kill verse two
DK in a new Ferrari, damn we runnin’ ‘round the lobby
We so high off life, and we ain’t got no fucking option
Reel them ducks in, we call it going fishing
Washing machine all that money, we call it cleaning dishes
Making birds take a bath, we call it shaving pigeons
And I ain’t PeeWee Longway but your ho know I’m dealing
I’m cold hearted, I don’t got no feelings
In that new drop top, I don’t got no ceilings
The roof is absent, ball like I got cancer
I’m the man in Atlanta, ask your favorite dancer
