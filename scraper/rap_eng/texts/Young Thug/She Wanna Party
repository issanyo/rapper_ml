[Bridge: Young Thug & Milie Go Lightly]
Drinks in the air
Rich nigga, put that Ace of Spades in the air
Mack a couple bitches, yeah, we played everywhere
Shake it up and pop it, now we sprayed everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Milie Go Lightly]
And we be saucin'
I love her, so you know I got her flossin'
I'm not a dentist, but a nigga flossin'
I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coffin

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm 'bout to turn it up
She wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party with a real nigga
Shawty wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party, she wanna party
She wanna party, she wanna party

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Twist it like a Tootsie Roll, Roll, Roll
Like a movie play your fuckin' role, role, role
Can't believe my circle small like Cheerios
Hate to say it, but it saved another Bankroll
She tryna pop it all for me
Lil shawty tryna drop it all for me
But I see right through her body
That she just want her money, she not vibin'
And if you look, that shit is what I'm poppin'
I left you with a brick, better re-rock it
Fucked her good, now her heart is in my pocket
Her heart beatin', mind racin', but we gotta pace it
Sit on my face, that pussy wet like she fresh out the lake and
I milked this place, I beat the case, crank up my generator
I got some X, I got some syrup, I'm smokin' turtle tank and

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Millie Go Lightly]
And we be saucin'
I love her so you know I got her flossin'
I'm not a dentist but a nigga flossin'
I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coffin

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm 'bout to turn it up
She wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna burn it up
She wanna party with a real nigga
Do it with a real nigga
Shawty wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party with a real nigga
Now she wanna party, she wanna party
She wanna party (shawty wanna party), she wanna party

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I wanna know if you gon' roll with me
I'm tryna see if you gon' stroll with me
Jeffery tryna roll, ayy
You should try livin' with a gangster
Stay down with me if I'm banged up
I'ma do or die with you no matter what
No matter what
Everything about you please me
Darlin' I'm hungry, I wan' eat that pussy
From you, away could never push me, darlin'
I want you for real
And if you feel like I wasted your time, I reimburse
Now I don't mind puttin' a little interest on it
Okay about you, I'm ready to kill
I'ma come back on it, appeal
Look at my kick game, reimbursin'
And I might put a lil interest on it

[Bridge: Young Thug & Milie Go Lightly]
Drinks in the air
Rich nigga, put that Ace of Spades in the air
Mack a couple bitches, yeah, we played everywhere
Shake it up and pop it, now we sprayed everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Milie Go Lightly]
And we be saucin'
I love her, so you know I got her flossin'
I'm not a dentist, but a nigga flossin'
I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coffin

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm 'bout to turn it up
She wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna burn it up
She wanna party with a real nigga
Do it with a real nigga
Shawty wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party with a real nigga
Now she wanna party, she wanna party
She wanna party (shawty wanna party), she wanna party
