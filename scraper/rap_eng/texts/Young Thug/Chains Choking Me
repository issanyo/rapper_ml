[Intro: Young Thug]
Ye, ye
Yeah
Wheezy Beats

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I might die from all these chains choking me in my sleep
I been travelin' with the 'chete like lil' savage wit me
Last night I had a 15, it was 12, on me
Tryin' to get rid of me but I won't go
Favorite noise is when we sexing
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh-oh-oooh (mmm)

[Verse 2: Gunna, Young Thug, and Both]
Put a lear inside the sky, hunnid thousand some feet
(thousand some feet)
Chrome hearts covering my eyes, Yeezy boosts on my feet
(boosts on my feet)
We get high fly through the clouds, I'm as high as can be
(high as can be)
Forgiatos on my ride, gettin' that money like Meech
(money like Meech)
Diamonds all under my chin, you gon' know these VVs
(know these VVs)
I been cashin' out on drip, this Supreme Louis V
(Supreme Louis V)
I just popped another pill, pour that lean in the peach
(lean in the peach)
Hope my cousin get his appeal, make it back to these streets
Floatin' through the atmosphere, I am out of your reach
(out of your reach)
I ain't have to sign no deals, still got hunnids on me
(hunnids on me)
Coupe with 24 inch rims on that "Big Bentley B"
Run inside the crib, treat this bitch like a suite
I might die from all these chains choking me in my sleep
I keep stackin' all these backends, keep my bitches on fleek
Last night, I had a 15, so there was 12 on me
Now-ooh-ooh, bring the love right back, yeah

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I bend it over face down, ooh
I got the team racks now, ooh
I'm tired of riskin' my soul
Plain jane, on a bust down
Rep the set, I'm gon' get down
I make sure you wake up like a Bachelorette
Sprinter or tour bus, we got used to that
Nappin' on a jet, 'cause we barely rest
Plain Jane AP, I put ice in that
Probably on x and that angel dust
I got a little  coke, what you want, but you gotta use your nose
Light brown diamonds on my wrist like Corona
I hopped on the jet with a stick, we big as the law when we rich
My pilots are doin' the dash, I be getting jet lash
I put the tint on the tag, I don't do the clearance tags
Won't wear the same thing, I'm a brat
I ran up this money, don't lack
I'm tired of the backstabs, put that dick in her abs like
Oooooh (Wheezy Beats)
Won't you bring on my lovin' back here
You-you see that hoe? you better not fall in love with me
Ain't got a caution tape, 'round all this hole baby girl
You better not fall in love with me
I'm runnin' back just how she backflips
Oh baby, I know she back there lookin' like
Ooh-ooh-oooooooh
Do not fall in love with me
