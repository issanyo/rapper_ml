[Intro: Peewee Roscoe & Young Thug]
Thugger
Ya digg?
Yeah, we got more rings than Michael Jordan
And, um, we ain't shot no jumper
But we have shot a couple niggas, you know
You digg?
I digg
Thugger, I digg
Ice on, and I digg
(London On Da Track, bitch)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Y-S-L, we gon' catch a couple bodies
If these niggas think we sweet in these streets (yeah, whoa, yeah)
I know I'ma fuck that bitch from the bottom to the top
I'ma buy her a brand new watch, nigga, yes, indeed (yah)
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
You with that same ho, boy
You 'posed to swap out with them bitches (what?)
If she the truth, you 'posed to show that lil' bitch riches (you, what?)
They wanna fuck my bitch 'cause she fly as a Frisbee (fly as a Frisbee)
I stuffed that pussy with a broom like a witch (what ya tell 'em?)
Yeah, I'm screamin' yeah like I'm E-40
Yeah, I drank that lean, but I'm not snorin'
Yeah, sing to her like Lil' Corey (what?)
Yeah, I wanna fat baby like Norbit (swoop)
Ooh, she wanna tell me she for real and how she livin', how she feel right now
Ooh, I usually don't give her no head, but I'm so drunk, I'm goin' down

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Y-S-L, we gon' catch a couple bodies
If these niggas think we sweet in these streets (hrrrrrat)
(London On Da Track, bitch)
I know I'ma fuck that bitch from the bottom to the top
I'ma buy her a brand new watch, nigga, yes, indeed
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck that bitch from the bottom
Fuck that little bitty bitch from the bottom
I'ma go an' pop my motherfuckin' collar
I'ma big ol' blood, I'ma pop my bollar
I'ma go shootin' your motherfuckin' father
And my kids gonna know, "God damn, he was ballin'"
And my partner gon' shoot at your motherfuckin' partner
Got so much water, I can buy me a dolphin
You can run off with a nickel or a dime, or an ounce
Or a motherfuckin' bird, nigga, still get a coffin, yeah
Got a whole dirty bird on a motherfuckin' fish scale, yeah, no dolphin
I'ma fuck me a bitch in the hole, I'm a dog
You ain't a real street nigga, you ain't took no losses
Why the fuck your clique ain't talkin' when I catch 'em?
I'ma pop your ass, y'all ain't no ballers (woo)
I'ma slow it down like I'm on a MARTA bus
And we control this town, boy, ain't no clownin' us
Yeah, these niggas some haters, I see 'em frownin' us
Meanwhile, these niggas' bitches love being 'round us

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Y-S-L, we gon' catch a couple bodies
If these niggas think we sweet in these streets
(London On Da Track, bitch)
I know I'ma fuck that bitch from the bottom to the top
I'ma buy her a brand new watch, nigga, yes, indeed
Ayy, yeah
