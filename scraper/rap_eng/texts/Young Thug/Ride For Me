Tell me you gon' ride for me (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, ride)
Tell me you gon' die for me (you gon' die)
Tell me you gon' die by what you live for (live for)
Tell me you gon' ride wit' me (tell me you gon' ride for me, ride)
Tell me you gon' fire on a bitch, baby
These niggas fake like a display, nigga (yeah)
Catch a murder case, then skip states with him

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bet, bet, nigga leakin' on his sheets (pow, pow)
That's the shit I get when I get (when I get that)
Buy a bag and smoke it like a zip (like a zip)
Tell me where's the logical event?
Bustin' a bazooka, turn your noodle to chalupa
[?]
Livin' like a dork, fuck a geek
You don't gotta work mama (work no more)
You can go get everything you see (everything about that)
I was just was chillin' with your bitch
And I went on and cut the chase and told her, "Suck a nigga's dick or somethin'" (SANDOS)
I was 17 and I was gettin' it like a fuckin' ball player
Then I took care all my kids for somethin' (big [?] shit)
Big player, I'ma pop into the end zone (yeah)
Good lookin', she gon' chew it like some bubblegum
I'ma spend a lot of money 'cause it's more to come (money)
I was havin' zero dollars, now a nigga on (yeah, yeah)
Tell you when I get back (tell you when I get back)
Tell me when I cash out (hah)
Tell me why you ran from my mama
Yeah yeah, you know I ain't scared of that (you know I ain't scared of that)
These bitches know a nigga ballin' (ballin')
And you know we playin' with these bands (playin' with them bands)
Spyder shit, the Bentley crawlin' (ah, ah, ah)
My lil' nigga dead on them Xan (dead on them Xan)
Big dawg shit off the rip
Big bag make a nigga limp (blat)
Put five bands on your lip (blat, blat, blat)
You better nip it in the bud like a chip (nip it in the bud)
Little red robbin' nigga, do it (do it)
Little red ridin' in the hood nigga (hood)
Pablo got me chokin' on that good (good)
And you can't do it better than he could (could)
Fuck Donald Trump, leave him ditch slumped
Trap boomin' like I'm ISIS nigga, big bomb
Whole lotta shit, that's what your bitch need, no
Whole lotta dick is what your bitch get though (yah)
Whole lotta money got these bitches changin' minds
Whole lotta money got them wanna stay around (swear)
Way too much money, quick, get that shit down (bitch)
Bitch, don't you trip, don't you make a fuckin' sound

[Chorus: Young Thug & 24hrs]
Tell me you gon' ride for me (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, ride)
Tell me you gon' die for me (you gon' die for me)
Tell me you gon' die by what you live for (live for)
Tell me you gon' ride for me (tell me you gon' ride for me, ride)
Tell me you gon' fire on a bitch, baby
These niggas fake like a display, nigga, yeah
Catch a murder case, then skip states with him

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
24hrs
Me and A-Trak in a two-seater (skrrt, skrrt)
Fuck around and waste the whole two liter (damn)
She said, "Twenty, boy, you don't care" (You don't care)
Chain lit up like a fair (bling bling)
TYO my mothafuckin' blood brother (blood brother)
Hundred bands a week, I keep it undercover (count it up)
Put a 50 on your head for my little brother (50)
Pullin' up to Vegas in a helicopter (hey)
VVS diamonds like a chandelier
Shawty, she give ass, I cannot handle it
Money stacked tall, it's not little (sheesh)
She said, "Twenty fuck me like a little... beast"
I feel just like Raji on the jetski (damn)
I'ma buy her diamonds if she let me (bling)
Sippin' on mimosas with the jeweler (jeweler)
Only measure money with a ruler (ruler)
"Twenty, you been on my mind
A-Trak, you been on my mind
Thugger, you been on my mind"
Hello, pussy really call my line
You should really call my line
You been on my mind
You should really call my line
You been on my mind
You should really call my line
You been on my mind
Hello, you should really call my mind

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Tell me you gon' ride for me
Tell me you gon' die for me (you gon' die)
Tell me you gon' die by what you live for (you live for)
Tell me you gon' ride for me (ride)
Tell me you gon' fire on a bitch, baby
These niggas fake like a display
Catch a murder case, then I skip states
Catch a murder case, then I skip states

[Outro: 24hrs]
You been on my mind
Oh, you been on my mind
Oh, you been on my mind
Oh, you been on my mind
Oh, you should really call my line
Oh, you should really call my line
Oh, you should really call my line
Oh, you should really call my line
