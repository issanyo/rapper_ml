Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave

Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave

If you tryna fuck  one , not all the dawgs
Young Aviator Keyyz, gotta pass the law
Young Aviator Keyyz, never stoppin'
Aviator Keyyz, right behind me
Aviator Keyyz, change the climate

[Verse 1]
Hundred thousand YE's
I pull up with a hundred pounds of weed
Aviator Chanel, double C's
I got every single kind out
Told the girl ain't no timeout
I perfected this rhymin'
Nothin' but foreigns I'm ridin' in
Finally rich and it's showin', and I'm lettin' it
I've been goin' near the sun lately
Everything that I'm in, yeah, it came, yeah
I got 26 Cuban Doll chains, yeah
Nigga takin' this shit down Sunset

[Chorus]
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
If you tryna fuck one, not all the dawgs
Young Aviator Keyyz, gotta pass the law
Young Aviator Keyyz, never stoppin'
Aviator Keyyz, right behind me
Aviator Keyyz, change the climate

[Verse 2]
I like the way she give head
I call her Mitchell and Ness
I keep a drum on the TEC (brrt)
I gotta protect all my kids (brrt)
I don't need no help with this (brrt)
Bitch, put my kids on your tits
I put your name on my wrist
Fat Richard Mille on my wrist
See my bag, bitch, see my bitch behind me
Gold diamonds with, match the side-kick
I made promises, and I'm keepin' it
Get the Range Rover, autobiography
Talkin' crazy, slap his ass with the shine (brr)
Put the, light up wrists at any time (brr)
Ric Flair with the times, eww
Big B's everywhere, suu whoop (brr, brr)
Shawty said I be the realest
Can't get enough of this killin'
The weed that I smoke smell like chitlins
Boosie & webbie im trillest
I been tied in with the killers
I been tied in with the dealers
I put some rings on my fingers
Hand shinin' like the Thriller
Whippin' it, go grab the trigger
Foreigns behind me, BMF
Boardin' the jet with the real plug
Two hundred racks of skrilla
Red bottoms, she a killer
Red bottoms, she a killer
Gucci slides for the chillin'
Jimmy Choo when I miss her
Three times a week nails
Shawty takin' good care
Wheezy went and popped a bail
Young Keyzz go Alicia
Who ya man? oh well
I could never ever tell
I'm not tryna Dwell
Buy Chanels for your tears

[Chorus]
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
Young Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave
Wheezy the wave, young Wheezy the wave, tsunami wave
Wheezy the wave, tsunami wave
If you tryna fuck one, not all the dawgs
Young Aviator Keyyz, gotta pass the law
Young Aviator Keyyz, never stoppin'
Aviator Keyyz, right behind me
Aviator Keyyz, change the climate
