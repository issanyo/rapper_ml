[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Hit-Boy on the beat, HS87 the plug
You know MMG in the street so them real niggas showin love
We ain’t throwin' up no ones like we movin' in, we came with bags
Folarin said no hands, let me see you clap!

[Hook: Wale]
Clappers to the front, front, front, front
Clappers to the front, front, front, front
Shawty got a big ol’ butt
Oh yeah!!!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Real niggas gon' clap, I’m still holdin' on my strap
Real hoes act right and all these fake hoes get left
All I want is that check, smell this Bel Air on my breath
Rich Forever my set, that mean I can’t sleep with no debt
Wale my nigga, workin' tight on all that we rep
Walkin' round my new estate like I’m the king of Zaire
Mastermind right here, I got 30 rounds right here
Know I burn it down right here, nigga we certified 'round here
Kilo 35 'round here, we gon' tear him down right here
Half a mil' in one night, I’m the king of the diamonds right here

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
I said clap, clap, clap it to the front, girl is yo back stolen?
Clap, clap, I think I’m 'bout to front you on a bag or somethin'
Clap, clap, clap, matter fact, most times I be the cause of that
Show me where yo baddest bitch, I’ll show where you lost her at
2 Rolex like 40 stacks, may just go and floss it back
I just left some rendezvous, my broad said she could take off a month
I be with CB, Virginia, that's Tappahannock
I be with CB's, shout out to Chase and Zackie
There go jazzy spinners, supper clubbin' 87
Animals be cross-breedin', don't you see my mink is draggin'?
I got it bros and I think y'all need some grownup values
I’m thinkin' my jewel investors, you thinkin' them Jordan Gammas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
Look, I like a real fat bubble back
Gucci bag, Louis trap
King of diamonds, DOA
An Onyx thot, I'm throwin' knots
Show me tits, I’ll show you stacks
Throw it back, I’ll throw you racks
Geechi, bring Corona back
Gold Rolex, that 40 stacks
Bring one back to DC ’03
East street where the border at
My new bitch had to bring a new bitch
Cause fuck a one bitch, I’m bored of that
Bel Air Rose, Ciroc no chase
Little bit of OJ order that
Clappers where my tour was at
I think we need some more of that
Made her twerk or place a work
Couldn’t you wait? Yall here to fuck
TIV, I did it first
Dick 'em D, make em hurt
Shawty got a big ol butt, that’s what’s up
I wanna touch but for how much? I got enough
Let's get it!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Big butt bitch
You wanna drop it, shake yo big butt bitch
Back it up, back it up, back it up, hold up, is that for me?
Booty big, I tell Stevie Wonder, "Would you like to see?"
Do what y'all doin for me, do it
Do what y'all doin for me, do it
Do what y'all doin for me, do it
This hard earned cash gon be yours only if you do it
Now clap it clap it clap it clap it let’s grab it
Wale want you to do it
Thugger want you to do it
Hit Boy want you to do it
Fat Trel want you to do it
Ricky want you to do it
I see you want to do it
Meechy want you to do it
All the skrippas please do it

[Hook]
