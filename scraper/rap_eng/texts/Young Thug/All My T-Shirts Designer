[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I poured up a four then I spiked it with a Xan now my day real slow (yeah)
Imma go big, lit, jump off it, do it slow motion

Baby speed up, can you re-up re-up

You fuck niggas after me
The rats was chasing and they captured me
Rich school, I'm a graduate
All my old hoes harassing me
All these po-pos harassing me
How am I supposed to give back
When every time I do it, man, they raid that?
My paper say I'm claustrophobic
They still put me in the paddy-wagon
They wonder why we capping back at them
I fell and now I'm right back at it
These diamonds got these bitches staring at it
These diamonds got these niggas plotting on it
But how you gonna take something from them [?]
Plus this blood money
