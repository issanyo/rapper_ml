[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger, Jeffrey, Hendrixx, Wizard, ah
Dripset, dripset, dripset got the ho lit, wet, lit, wet, ooh
Slime, yeah!

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Slurpin' me up
Monica Lewinsky, ooh
Massacre, massacre (massacre)
Fuck who all in it (brrr)
I fuck with the robbers (I do)
I fuck with the shotters (I fuck with the shotters)
I broke on the red dogs
Took off and didn't stop
Yo, money stand up through the roof
And point at that shit and say goals (goals)
I'ma slime ball 'em, I'ma kill 'em and give his momma my condolences (condolences)
Yeah, my drip gone stain like hot sauce (ooh)
Know real gangstas like Narcos (ooh)
No slow money, no turtle (no, no, turtle)

[Verse 1: Future]
I was just sittin' in the Bentley (yeah)
I got some Monica Lewinsky (I got some Monica)
I'm goin' crazy in Fendi (I'm goin' crazy)
I cannot trap in the Hemi (I cannot trap)
I'm stackin' it way up like Remmy (I'm stickin' the wheel)
I got more syrup than Denny's (I got more syrup)
We at the Playhouse with Lenux (we hit the [?])
Cookin' the dope like a chemist
My brothers, ain't none but some menace
Ain't rob me a nigga in a minute
I'm a rock star, John Lennon
Got my doors up, no pretendin'
My Aventador ain't rented
The big Lambo look extended
Racks on me, I admit it
Gold on me like Olympics
Diamond gold an Atlantic
Hottest nigga in the planet
Uzi on me and a cannon
Swangin' through, panoramic
Got a call, major damage
Feed my dogs more Xanax
YSL, hang with gang bangers
Hope them niggas understand me

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Slurpin' me up
Monica Lewinsky, ooh
Massacre, massacre (massacre)
Fuck who all in it (brrr)
I fuck with the robbers (I do)
I fuck with the shotters (I fuck with the shotters)
I broke on the red dogs
Took off and didn't stop
Yo, money stand up through the roof
And point at that shit and say Ghost (Ghost)
I'ma slime ball 'em, I'ma kill 'em and give his momma my condolences (condolences)
Yeah, my drip gone stain like hot sauce (ooh)
No real gangsta's like Narcos (ooh)
No slow money, no turtle (no, no, turtle)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Shottas, let that shit hang like a rasta
Play with that bread and we toast you
I'm a big blood like my partner
We do not play with imposters
We don't talk to 'em, we knock 'em off
And we gon' kiss all your partners, yeah
We gon' fuck over your roster, yeah
And I'm still screamin' free Roscoe, yeah
She suck me up with a waffle, yeah
I beat it up like a boss do, yeah
Uh, don't take it personal (no, no)
Double R, with the stars and the Wraith
Bentley trunk outside, right now

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Slurpin' me up
Monica Lewinsky, ooh
Massacre, massacre (massacre)
Fuck who all in it (brrr)
I fuck with the robbers (I do)
I fuck with the shotters (I fuck with the shotters)
I broke on the red dogs
Took off and didn't stop
Yo, money stand up through the roof
And point at that shit and say Ghost (Ghost)
I'ma slime ball 'em, I'ma kill 'em and give his momma my condolences (condolences)
Yeah, my drip gone stain like hot sauce (ooh)
No real gangsta's like Narcos (ooh)
No slow money, no turtle (no, no, turtle)
