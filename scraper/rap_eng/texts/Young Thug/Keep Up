[Chorus]
Fuck I just can't keep up
And it’s cause I love you both, aye
And don't you ever ever think about
Treating me the worst way cause I love you both, aye
I'm still running ’round this bitch thugging
I'm still running 'round this bitch dirty
I'm still running 'round this bitch busting
Can't believe I ain't gave it up yet
We gon' leave a nigga head on today
We gon’ leave a nigga neck on his chest
Got myself saying fuck a nigga bitch
Can’t believe it
Can't believe I ain’t gave it up yet

[Verse 1]
For this cash ain't no difference (lit)
On his head like a Mitchell & Ness
Went to bed with a bitch then she text
Yeah this cash make her different
Burberry bag on my back
You're a plain Honda Civic lil bitch
The fuck is you doing with the cash
Gon' end up missing bitch
We letting off sticks at your car
Hah, ya digg
We spazz on yo ass like you down with the law
Pull up the Bentley, the choppa be whole little bitty boy
Pull up with stacks
I got more money than you and your whole little squad
Touching them babies, hah
Do ’em the worst way, hah
Keep acting crazy, do no more hear or say
How many chickens gon' lay an egg, I need some rackades
I stack up some green like Saint Patrick's day
Imma try but

[Chorus]
I can't keep up, hey!
I care for you both, aye!
So don't you ever ever think about
Treating me the worst way cause I love you both, hey!
Still in the streets thugging, yeah
I'm still in the streets thugging, yeah
