[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Ayo kiddo, I like chicken, I like birds
Leave a nigga brains on the curb, I'm Picasso
Lil' nigga whats the word (Brrr, what's that?)
Whats that? Lil' nigga done the birds

[Hook: Bloody Jay]
Keep that pistol close, call it paranoia
Smoking on back to back, call it paranoia
Gotta look over my shoulder, call it paranoia
I call it being on point, they call it paranoia

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Migos drop them birds, it leave me paranoia
Thugger too loud inside church, I'm screaming 'Hallelujah!'
Miley Cyrus, tan sand stand for Cociyola
Make these bitches suck me up until I know I owe em
My toilet's too high, I'm pissing molly water
I'm gon' keep one in to stop these hoes from gettin' on yah
You know Thug and Bloody Jay about that action
[?] diamond bezels look just like the damn sun
I know she a Cinderella but you keep 'em out your business
They be crying for spaghetti while my pockets sittin' on lettuce
Count my fetti, riding on a bike, your bitch on the pegs
I want M&M's instead, and by that I'll leave you red

[Verse 2: Bloody Jay]
Riding with all these straps they call it paranoia
They say I'm paranoid, kick a nigga in the ass, hemorrhoids
That's them 'Anybody did it?' boys
Are you niggas making any noise?
That chopper make a lot of noise
Toys R Us, yeah we got a lot of toys
Clip long as Geoffrey the Giraffe neck
When that thing get to hittin'
Niggas get rocked like a drum set
Oops I mean Thugger
Niggas get it how they live, so they all gon' be like Slugger
Constantly looking over my back
I should of listened to my mother
[?] yeah thats my blood brother
