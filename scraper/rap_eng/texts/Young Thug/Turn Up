Turn up for the club (turn up, turn up)

Alright just turn up for the club

Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back

[Verse 1]
Electric slide, baby slip and slip and slip and slide, slide, slide
Turn up on the side, turn up side to side, side, side, side
I got what you want, I got what you need (I got it)
I got what you want, I got what you need
I know you crazy, I know what you want
I know what you like, just come home with me
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock side to side
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock front to back
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride on this side
What, walk, walk, walk, walk, front to back (Thugger!)
I want it, fuck it, baby, show it
I got big racks and I'm loaded
I want somethin' and I know it
Bring it straight, straight to me
Party boy, is my first name
Playboy is my last name
Fuck you slow in the fast lane
Suck me up 'til I'm crashing
Crash into your pussy
Chains on and it's gushy
All these niggas be wishin' they was in my position
Thugger, Thugger, Thugger!

[Verse 2]
I fucked her good and she know it
I ate it good and she owe me
She suck me good and she hopin'
I put it all in her throat and
Now she wanna drink my babies
Pussy wet and I'm soakin'
I want green like a lettuce
Bought a massage with my lotion
Yeah, like a boss do it
Yeah, I might talk to it
Yeah, I might walk to it
Fuck it, I might walk through it
Fucked her on a bean bag
Black tiger, white Jag
Bitch I'm ridin' with old lady
Nah I can't Skype back
But I can late night that
Mayweather, I fight that
And I don't even know her, really
Break her jaw like I'm Gilly
Two years, four milli'
I just want a sore kidney
Got it and she know I'm gettin' it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna be about it
I just wanna hit it once
You can let him do it second
Balmain with zippers on 'em
Yeah this a private pocket
I deserve a Big Meechy
We don't cuff the thottie thotties
