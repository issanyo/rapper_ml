[Verse 1: Premadonna]
If I send you nudes you better not expose
What you mean is I a freak? I mean I suppose
I walk in the room and unlock the door
I be Aaliyah and we finna rock the boat, we finna rock the boat
But don't capsize
Pussy so wet it'll baptize you
Welcome to my water park
The only one that's open after dark
Not to mention, you got free admission
Any thing you like come and get it
Nasty bitch, I fit that description
I won't please without your permission
Feelin' sick without your prescription
Take me in the kitchen
On the counter
Into the ceilin'
Fill me up with your cream fillin'
You a cool nigga and I'm a hot girl
Niggas want me but I'm not theirs
In the porsche, you hung like a horse
And I always wanted to be a cowgirl
You and me was meant to be
So let's take over it's our world
You and me was meant to be
So let's take over it's our world

[Verse 2: Premadonna]
You got me excited
You know just how I like it
Swear your ass must be a psychic
Reverse cowgirl when I ride it
I be fiendin' bout you daily
Almost wrecked my Mercedes
Had to slow down when I go down
I swear you rep this O town
I love it when you throw down
It's too wet baby, don't drown
And if I get too freaky don't you think that I'm a ho now
My panties, they are see through
No threesome, just me and you
Do not tell them what we do
Just eat it like some seafood
Just eat it like some seafood
I'm not tryna be rude
Just chill you know you my boo
You know it's all about you
Eat it like some seafood
I'm not tryna be rude
Just chill you know you my boo
You know it's all about you
