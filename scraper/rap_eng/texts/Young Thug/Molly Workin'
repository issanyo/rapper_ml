[Hook]
I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pulled me a couple just cause molly workin'
Stick from my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody

[Verse 1]
Geeked out my motherfuckin' mind
I got a whole lotta shit and ain't paid a dime
I take everything, I steal the scene
I take nigga's bling, cause money talk like Charlie Sheen
I got horse lookin' bitches
That move a lot of weight like I sponsored them with fitness
But I sponsored them with chickens
And they trick you niggas to the bait like fishes
One time for all of my J's that
Treat me like a king, but my queen is a maid
I don't play no games but I'm boo and I'm higher
If I don't (?) those blunts then I need me a new lighter

[Hook]
I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pulled me a couple just cause molly workin'
Stick from my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody

[Verse 2]
Molly everywhere like a faucet
Call me screech cause I'm a motherfuckin' geek
At the monster
Dive in that pussy like kowabunga
Woah, woah
Geeked up pull a no show
Cause I been had a check, first .44
Look at him, he tryna save her, that's a no-no
Just for that I'll let the little boy crow
Hocus-pocus
She let us fuck her everywhere, holy molley
My team red like Ravioli
They'll cut your hair like Sam, no sosi

[Hook]
I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pulled me a couple just cause molly workin'
Stick from my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody
