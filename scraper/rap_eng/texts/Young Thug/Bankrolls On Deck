[Hook: TI]
Man we got big bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Got big bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck

Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck

Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob

[Verse 1: TI]
Keep the mils in the bank, get the racks on person
50 to 75 at a time, on purpose
Shittin' in the hood with the gats on person
If a nigga out of line the .45 go to squirtin'
And I ain't fuckin' around, am I?
I'ma probably about the hardest ever out of Atlanta
It's a ring of real niggas, got the game in the slang
Nine out of ten, it's my homeboy number

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I told my ho back up, oh shit, don't need no beotch
I get on beats and talk my shit just like a beotch
Ho you a beotch, girl you a beotch
Bae you a beotch
Forever I love Atlanta like a FILA
I pull up in Houston, used the hitstick Madden, Eli
I might get caught up with lots of guns like TI
I don't want your ho, I want your honey like a beehive
I don't want your ho, I want your honey like a beehive
Big bankroll rolls

[Hook: TI]
Man we got big bankrolls on deck

Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck

[Verse 3: Shad da God]
Bankrolls bustin' out Balmain
Plain hundreds, they like Jane
Bitch I'm all in these streets like a Reindeer
Your ho not gonna stutter my name
She actually gone say that shit clear
You know I drop loads of pimpin' in her ear
Make the lil' ho do a split like a check
Then I lost her like police in my rear
I can put this on God
Dope get smoked like some dope in lean
Dope in the lean, lots of dope in the lean
Lots of dope in the liter
Who is drinkin'? I need oil with me
Jigga, Thug, gotta pay lawyer fees
Bitch we really with the trap and the reef'
Too much cheese, got that Mac all on me

[Hook: TI]
Man we got big bankrolls on deck

Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck

Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck

[Verse 4: TI]
The trap went left while we stayin' down with it
While you bullshit, we the one playin' around with it
Keep a nigga wouldn't walk around with a 50 in the clip
I ain't even need to stand around with it
And I demand all 50, states in the states, everybody ride with me
For you to go to Queens probably gotta call 50
When I'm in the pizzeria and I got it all with me
What the fuck you thought little ho? Got big bankrolls on deck
Break a quarter mil just to blow, put Phil and Doe on that

[Verse 5: Young Thug]
Rush a nigga standin' on the block
Got a whole bunch of pills in the sack, and they blue dolphins, pussy nigga playin',  he get left in the coffin
I been jumped off my momma porch
And I go crazy when bored
Give education like Du Bois
Cliff, I'm a bloody little dog
12 inches in her like a yard
Big bankroll without fraud
These little niggas not makin' any noise

[Hook: TI]
Man we got big bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Got big bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob](9052839)
Bankroll, no check, bankrolls on God
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
Bankrolls on deck, bankrolls on deck
We the bankroll mob
