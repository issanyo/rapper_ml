[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Human trafficking, we got these hoes for sale, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got the Aventador fully, yeah
I'm mixing Act in all my sushi, uh oh oh
I make her tell me that's my pussy, yeah
Gotta drink that syrup, gotta smoke that cookie, yeah
Ayy, they red dot you on my say so
Two hundred racks and now the case closed, yeah
We gettin' cheese like we was Esco's
They throw tacos and we catch those, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Casino]
Money old like the temptation
Diamonds froze like an igloo
Just got three hundred bags in
Sold 'em all in twenty minutes
Range Rover, cost the same as a Bentley
Old money like an Atari
I'm gettin' new money, PlayStation (FreeBandz)
Jump on a jet, change the weather
Red dot like you got chicken pox
Change your mind if you tryna rob
My chain weigh a key, I'm heavyweight
My bitch she got a lot of followers
But I have way more paper than her
Plain rose gold Audemar
I ain't got a lot of jewelry on
Two diamond ropes cost me ninety bands

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got the Aventador fully, yeah
I'm mixing Act in all my sushi, uh oh oh
I make her tell me that's my pussy, yeah
Gotta drink that syrup, gotta smoke that cookie, yeah
Ayy, they red dot you on my say so
Two hundred racks and now the case closed, yeah
We gettin' cheese like we was Esco's
They throw tacos and we catch those, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
AK's on the floor (slatt)
Money on the floor (let's go)
I keep bitches on deck (and what)
Got Louis Vuitton drawers on my dick (let's go)
You used to trap at the store (yeah)
We used to rob at the store (yeah)
Now I'm gettin' a hundred-fifty for a show, woah
Yeah, Hellcat in the garage, I gave that shit to my bro
Everything she want she got it, she gave a nigga six hundred poor
Yeah, I took bricks of molly, I got bricks of both
Yeah, I just got bitches slidin', I got hoes on coast (let's go)
Your drip outer space and you fresh as saran
You was out of place and they made you ran
Invite the old me
Yeah, my bitches bad in they panties
Get all the bags, they can't stand me
I know you and your mans in the back seat
Had the Bentley Sport, I was mashing
I put on eight rings, I had 'em kissing

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got the Aventador fully, yeah
I'm mixing Act in all my sushi, uh oh oh
I make her tell me that's my pussy, yeah
Gotta drink that syrup, gotta smoke that cookie, yeah
Ayy, they red dot you on my say so
Two hundred racks and now the case closed, yeah
We gettin' cheese like we was Esco's
They throw tacos and we catch those, yeah

[Outro: Casino]
Balmain, two diamond ropes cost me ninety bands
Balmain, two diamond ropes cost me ninety bands
