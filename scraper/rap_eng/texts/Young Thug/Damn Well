Too many damn karts on my neck and wrist and ear
Could feed a fam of rabbits

[Verse: Young Thug]
I bought a trap car on Moreland Ave
Big lean making me lake no bath
Just bought a pair of gators they look like they got stabbed
After school picking up kids, attracting the staff

[Verse]
Bought my third fourway for my partner
And he faded me so my partner go back and robbed him
No Fight Club
Boy you know that we got choppers
Like Burger King
Have it your way, get hit with the whopper
Blatt blatt blatt

[Young Thug]
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slime season nigga
Bobby brown tender, 25 on me no [?]
Nigga wanna be a slime, cross out your family member
You don't wanna cross out your family member
That .25 gon' hit on your temple

[Hook: Young Thug]

I'ma slimer boy you know damn well
I'ma slimer, you know damn well
Boy you know damn well
I'ma chase it, chase it, chase it
You know damn well
I'ma get it til ain't none left
Oh you know damn well, damn well
