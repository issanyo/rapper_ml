[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Thugger, Baby
Thugger don't do nothin' for free, baby

Money stay talking to buckets
And no I'm not talkin' bout sex
They gon' keep rushin'
And I'm gone keep ducking
These niggas on speed dial for shit
Girl do your thing and I don't play games on no Wii
Hey Officer, Officer
You gon' have to use your hand, your feet, your gun
Ain't nothin' for free
I got these racks straight out the gutter, nigga
My young bitch out of college in love with a baller nigga
Balmain Jeans and Extendo Tees I mean like old Gorilla
Ain't nun for free
She won't even let a young nigga feel her
Yeah, she bad
I just might Michael Jackson that thriller
We won't do nun for free, we can't do nun for free
Hell yea, I can cut your lights off, ain't got a sword
I can't go back to bein' broke, I piss Tom Ford
If you did get it free, then Lil Mama, that is yours
Got em free, roller coaster ride, Thugger college dorm

[Bridge: Zonnique & Young Thug]
No we don't do shit for free
No we don't want nun for free!
All of my bitches be rollin' up
All of my niggas got lean in they cup
All of my niggas got plant & Dough
Throw some bands and watch 'em go

[Verse 3: Zonnique]
We showin' out

When you see us
We turnin' up
Just like it's nothin'
Can't help ourselves
Haters can't say nothing

[Hook: Zonnique & Young Thug]
And everybody in the club right now
It don't matter
They pay us to come and shut shit down
No, we don't do shit for free
They pay us to come and shut shit down
