We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks all day, oh yea yea
We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks
Hit the gas, no breaks, baby girl
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got ice on my wrist, your girl couldn't resist
I pour the drinks, she told me no
I told her, "girl, I insist"
I smell like kush, you Creed cologne
I have half of bag of this shit
The bag so heavy when we shop, my girl be dragging this shit
I got a girl from the 6, she helped me out on a leak
Gave me ten bands as a gift, and sealed the deal with a kiss
I got a girl from Gwinnett, you know her daddy is rich
But she keep coming to the hood without no panties and shit
I ain't no regular nigga, can't date no average bitch
I let her hang with them boys, she swear she grow on the clique
Pick diamonds stuffed in the navel, if can't re-watch on them tits
Look like a bag of money, bag of Kush, a bag of them bricks

Hit the gas, no breaks, baby girl
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I really, really run around
16K to get a Tummy Tuck
Surrounded by them bosses with a lot of funds
Bought that bitch a Phantom, cause she wanted one
Soon as I hit the door, she tearin' down the stairs
Soon as I hit the room, she tearing down my belt
Soon as I enter her, I feel her body melt
The thing is super-weird, I feel like Michael Phelps
I'm the last foe for my main ho
I buy her real gold, she no longer frost
Pinocchio bam we straight up by the bow
Dear, dear President, you know my main hoes

We can ride around the city with it
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
