[Intro: Young Scooter]
Can't trust these niggas you dig, they so broke
Watch out for these niggas playing both sides, a-hah
Brother with me in this bitch you digg, that's one til infinity

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Watch out for these niggas playing both sides
BM, FBG nigga til the day I die
Watch out for these bitches playing both sides
I fuck with slime and I ducktape my bricks everytime
Bitch I'm on a paper trail 'til the day I die
Seen shawty locked up and his brother died
Real nigga that's the only reason that I'm still alive
I never cross my niggas, playing both sides

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Whippin' a brick, right out a crock-pot
Put me a coupe on some sticks, drinkin on [?]
We the slimiest it get, you wanna swap sides
My bitch is black and they white, I don't do [?]
I'm in a chocolate Ferrari, yeah, I look like a spider
My fifth pocket molly
My partner on Roxies, yeah, my bitch caught a body
She eat up lil bitch like a [?]
She play with my drip I'ma dump her
She say I'm the best so I tongued her
Pimp the bitch, [?]
If you fuck my dog, make sure you keep it sexy

We got a few out of town it's the nosebleeds
I just got a call from Scooter, and he told me

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Watch out for these niggas playing both sides
BM, FBG nigga til the day I die
Watch out for these bitches playing both sides

Real nigga that's the only reason that I'm still alive
I never cross my niggas, playing both sides

[Verse 2: Future]
Triple cross, triple black cross, woah-oh-oh
Niggas they'll look at you just like a mill, eat you like food
Where I grew up there were warlords
Where I'm from we worship the drug lords
I'm on molly and xan, with the black card
And this gang done
Gave me a black heart
We bury cash at the graveyard
Tatted my chest with them angels
Tell my bitch to keep away the danger
Money inside the problems
Puttin' the gang on a private
You need to see life through my eyes
Mercedes all white navy blue top
I gotta get me another vault
Niggas ain't doing the withdrawals, gotta keep acty on deck
I gotta keep Becky on deck
I keep it real, it ain't no flex
Twenty five hundred for Actavis
I'm on a yacht with some convicts
Come from the gutter live lavishly
Keep one in the head automatically, yeah

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Watch out for these niggas playing both sides
BMFBG nigga til the day I die
Watch out for these bitches playing both sides
I fuck with slime and I ducktape my bricks everytime
Bitch I'm on a paper trail 'til the day I die
Seen shawty locked up and his brother died
Real nigga that's the only reason that I'm still alive
I never cross my niggas, playing both sides

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
You my nigga but I don't trust your man, damn
He a CEO, but why he take the stand, damn
In every verse I be wrappin' grams, yams
Just made a twin and played Uncle Sam, damn
Playing both sides'll get you killed quick
I know you down to ride, but is you gon' snitch
Trap the corner off [?] just me and rick
I get money in every zone, from one to six
These dirty bitches play both sides
Don't trust these hoes cause all of them lie
These dirty lawyers they play both sides
They'll Swap you out and make you do some time
A true feeling

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Watch out for these niggas playing both sides
BM, FBG nigga til the day I die
Watch out for these bitches playing both sides
I fuck with slime and I ducktape my bricks everytime
Bitch I'm on a paper trail 'til the day I die
Seen shawty locked up and his brother died
Real nigga that's the only reason that I'm still alive
I never cross my niggas, playing both sides
