(Intro)
These niggas ain't shit
(they ain't shit) (x2)
They mad though? or nah?
(they ain't shit) (x2)

(Verse 1: Wankaego)
I know these bitches ain't shit (I know, I know)
So I can never be a lame bitch (n-no, n-no)
Look at all these groupie ass niggas
These stupid ass niggas
Comin on with a though, all cupid ass niggas
Ain't shit, ain't shit, i would never change shit
Same clique came up, but i'm still the same bitch
I'm chasin' money babe, money babe
I ain't rich so i hustle for that check, for that set
For that dick, bitches never pay you back
So don't ever loan em shit
Bitches talk behind yo back, in yo face don't say shit
Kaego, all i know is Kaego
Must speak when i see you, but i don't fuck with you fake hoes

(Pre-Hook: Wankaego & (young Thug))
One minute they love you
Next minute they yellin' they hate you, (they yellin' they hate you)
They spellin' yo friends
But behind yo back, they trynna play you, (they trynna play you)
The same ones you heard
Be the same ones who claimin' they made you, (claimin' they made you)
They still owe you money, they know it, but they never payed you

(Hook: Wankaego)
I know these niggas ain't shit
I know these bitches ain't shit (x2)

(Verse 2: Young Thug)
These bitches ain't shit and these niggas ain't shit
These bitches lame bitches
When i went broke, i'm looking to break my wrists and shit
I'ma pull up with my clique, then we go fuck on yo bitch
Put it there right in here ass
Watch her shake like the (?), stuffin' my safe with them racks
I do not chase, but i catch, I (?) like woosh
Nigga get flipped just like (?)
Arm & ham one of these necks
I need a J and that mayo, and my niggas pullin' out
Like where the fuck do these K's go, (Where they go?)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Officer, these bitches ain't shit!
Officer, these hoes ain't shit, I swear to god, I swear to got, I swear to god
She ain't got no gun but when she leave all of us hit!
Pwff, pwff, pwff, pwff, pwff, pwff, pwff

(Verse 3: Foxx)
Ok, it's a milli-on
I get a whole lotta hate
Is it my birthday look at all this cake
Gotta couple tattoos in my face
I got a 454 do a nigga wan waste
I'll put a nigga back in his place
I got a gun so big can't fit on my waist
I'm from baton rouge nigga where it ain't safe
Tell a nigga back up i'ma need a little space
Niggas ain't shit, these niggas ain't shit
Nigga damn near rich, got a benz on my wrist
Red bone on my dick, 5 grand for my dick
5 grand for ya bitch, 5 grand for tha hit
Make a nigga ride through ya hood
And if i been comin, niggas dyin' in ya hood
Trill to the death, broke niggas to the left
You ain't talkin' bout no money
Nigga I'ma play def
Really!
