Devo
He say she be dabbing and she say he be dabbing but I just be like...nah, nigga don't be dabbing

[Chorus: Skippa Da Flippa]
Black Gucci shoes (woah)
Black Gucci suit (swear)
I was Gucci'd down, when Gucci made the news (what else)
Spiked Louboutin's (spikes)
I bought some for my friends (what else)
Givenchy on my kin, I can't wait to do it again (swear)
I'm moving fashion forward (fashion)
I'm moving fashion forward (fashion)
And when I go walk in they show love and close the store (thyow)
I'm moving fashion forward (what else)
I'm moving fashion forward (what else)
Ten pair of new Margiela's, go to Neiman's cop some more
I'm moving fashion forward (Flippa)

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
I'm here to the fashion (swear)
Vacay in the cabins (swear)
Before I take off, recline the seat and make sure the belt's fastened (vroom)
My jewelry game tragic (gold)
My shoe game is drastic (what else)
Told my momma bury me a G, Givenchy me clean in my casket (Givenchy me)
Been did Hugo Boss (Hugo Boss)
Eat it up right in ya jaw (say eat it up)
Louis'd down on the nawf (Louis'd down)
Gucci'd down on the nawf (say Gucci'd down)
All black Prps (hoe)
Bape shirt for the breeze (Bape)
I love shoes, I'm a fiend
Spent the grip up for the jean (thow wow)
Maison Margiela stepper (Maison Mar)
What would you do for the cheddar? (what would ya)
She only do what you let her
Get a lil' paper, you'll dress a lil' better (swear)
And I know I'm that captain (and I know)
I put you on to the fashion (I put ya)
Hoe game been on the fashion (game game)
Too much sauce, need a napkin

[Chorus: Skippa Da Flippa & Young Thug]

Givenchy on my kin (kin), I can't wait to do it again (again)
I'm moving fashion forward (forward)
I'm moving fashion forward (forward)
And when I go walk in they show love and close the store (store)
I'm moving fashion forward (forward)

Ten pair of new Margiela's, go to Neiman's cop some more (Jeffery)
I'm moving fashion forward (Slatt)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pour red in the raspberry (lean)
My swag everlasting
Bitch, I'm sharp I could stab you
I'm so fresh they all wanna harass me (woo)
Getting sucked up by Jasmine (sucked up)
Slurping my wood, cabin (slurp)
Skippa he started that dabbing
Lock 'em up for kidnapping, they jacking (hold on, wait)
When you did fuck shit for the tutor (tutor)
Even when I eat I'm clean (clean)
Watch a nigga dress these noodles (facts)
I got pink and green on looking like my Franck Muller (drip)
Gators on my feet with a King Kong mink, man fuck the zoo (argh)
Watch me pay my dues (bet)
Black boot cut Choo's (Choo's)
Sneeze, Jimmy Choo (Choo)
Skinny jean, can't move (can't move)

My gun black like Obama ('bama)
And it's a bazooka (zoo zoo zoo)
