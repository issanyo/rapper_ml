[Intro: Zuse]
Look 'pon me, look

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Thugga, I'm kill one of these suckers
Pussy ass nigga can't tell me nothing
Beat a nigga head with a Louisville slugger
Shoot a nigga dead then feed him to the gutter
Beat him, like a little bitch I treat him
It's on, on sight, like this I greet him
Pow! Talk that shit, nigga, now
Get your ass gunned down, nigga, this my town, I run it
Sucka nigga know he don't want it
Ain't nobody gon' keep me from walking up on it
Nigga love running 'round talkin' tough, don't he?
Pray to God, may I die, let 'em fly on my opponent
Hol' up, we will roll up, hop out of that Corolla
Spitting this AK outchea, at your chest until it blow up
Cuz, you are so done, absolutely no one
Can save you from the wrath I'm bringin' to yo' ass, I'm goin'
In on you and everyone you knowin'
I ride on you till no end, you ain't even gon' know when
I suffocate you, smother you, I ain't gon' leave you no wind
Everybody know you ain't got no win, cause I'm
Known to clown, hit the town, kick your door in
I'm lookin' at the hammer, barrel end at your end
Put dough in the back 'fore the thang start blowin'
The yop get goin', splatter your brains on the floor, I'm like

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Eww, eww, eww
Eww, eww, eww, eww

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
What you gonna do when I pull up on you, nigga?
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger
(For sure, for sure)
Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Eww, eww, eww
Eww, eww, eww, eww

[Verse 3: Zuse]
Catch a motherfucker at the stop light
Point, point, point, hold the Glock tight
Yeah, I'm bout the spinach, boy, Popeye
Niggas want beef, where my hot fries?
Cross me, nigga, get baptized
Yes, motherfucker, I'm the bad guy
Blow you away like a landmine - dead, flatline
I'm a God and I put that on mankind, huh
Bullet turn you into stop sign, huh
Swat a pussy nigga if he that fly
Light a nigga up, me no talk and beg
Crack a nigga up like the yolk out a egg
Smoke a nigga out like an ounce from a dread
These niggas straight pussy, ain't vouchin' for them
Ice cold nigga like a motherfuckin' gem
Branch out, nigga, like a motherfuckin' stem
Cut a nigga off, ain't tied up for them
Tell a bitch nigga I'm fire with the pen
Lay a nigga down, watch him die at the end
Four-five nigga, it's a nine, that's a ten
Pussy on my dick, you and I and my friend
Which one of ya'll wanna try this again?
Which one of ya'll wanna try me again?
Big body six, I'm high in the Benz
Flippin' the flow, on timin' again
Riggidy ruggidy rhymin' again
Pussy nigga, it's applying to him
V-I-P, ain't no line in for him
Fuck around, nigga, your chances are slim
Flexin' on 'em, exercise in the gym
Ballin' on 'em, got my hand in the rim

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Eww, eww, eww
Eww, eww, eww, eww
