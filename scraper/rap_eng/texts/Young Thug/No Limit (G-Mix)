I told her man that we cousins, ay
I made this remix for Usher
I did it for trappers and hustlers
I gave the game to my youngsters
I showed 'em how to get paper
We takin' trips to Jamaica
I've been bout it bout it since "Bout It, Bout It"
Bad bitches gon' come up out it
We ain't even gotta talk about it (uhh)

If the love has no limit, why your ass decline? (straight up)

Just one thing to make this finish if you cross the line

Okay you're fine, shawty you know that you're fine
I pull you out of the line
Then I recline, I put it right in your spine
I make you smile all the time
I pour you wine, I'm puttin' Act' into mine
I take it back like rewind
I take you back, put you in back of the Bach
I got my hand on your thighs
I am the ice cream man, no limit (yeah)
Pull up in a two seater with four women baby (mmm)
Mouth full of golds, lick you from head to your toes
All these lame dudes get exposed
Only the real, I give an F how you feel
I spent a check on these clothes
I make a wish in a Rolls, I got the stars on the roof
I am a dog, I go woof
I am the shit, I am the Pepe Le Pew (pew)
I got a rep in the crew (crew)
I got a plan with a partna (mm), I got her out of the Honda
I just might get her a tank
I give a fuck what you think
Takin' selfies in the bank

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
I'm Silkk The Shocker, clothes designer
Fendi, Prada, mama got the illest nana
Beat it proper, eat it up just like lasagna
Make me holler "Oh my God"
Call me daddy, but I'm farther from her father
Smoke the coochie up like marijuana
Do the honors, long as she mow the lawn up
Make her scream like "uhhh"
I'm the new Dave P Miller, yeah
Might ball in that chinchilla, ay
Probably try out for the A, ay
Cause I score more than these niggas, ay
'Member them TV dinners
Now I go to Nobu for the mean dinner, ay
I'ma go with the grilled steak, ay
Swear it feel good to be richer

[Chorus: Usher]
Make-make you say uh, no limit
Got that Master P, no limit baby
If I give you this black card (wizzop), no limit
Just know right now it’s the G-Mix
There's no limit baby

[Verse 5: Gucci Mane]
I done fucked with this one and that one
A white one, a black one
I've been there and done that now I ain't even on that
But these hoes ain't on shit anyway
And at the end of the day man I don't even want that
I lucked up then I fucked up and we broke up
Then we made up but I got locked back up
But it ain't how you fall, it's how you get right back up
I'm a one man army and my bitch my back up
Now it's sit ups, pull ups, drips, and push ups
Thinkin' bout the one who kept it triller
That's my chick, she kept it realer
None of these hoes ain't fuckin' with her
You my private soldier mama, can I call you meal? (huh)
It's truly ain't no limit bae and I can't wait to see you (whoo)
Everything you think you want, know I can't wait to give (it’s Gucci!)
Let's lay a rock solid foundation bae cause I just wanna build (yeah)
Your wildest dreams and fantasies, the way that you should live
Like Master P with golden ceilings babe and diamond chandeliers (brr)

[Outro: Usher]
Make you say uh, no limit
She put that Master P on me, no limit baby
Got her sitting courtside, no limit
Just know how it go if you put it on me
There's no limit baby
Make you say uh, no limit

Just know when you call and request it uh
Y'all asked for the G-Mix
