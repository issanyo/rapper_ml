[Intro: Young Thug and Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
You know we can get away
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Because I'm calling your name

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'ma hit it, never pass it
Booty fat like she eat asses
You can't see, you need glasses
They can't see me like masks
I know a way, I know I need
I won't misread, specs on when I treat it
I show my face when it's real
I'll share my place when it's real
Promise me that you won't squeal
I am your doctor, your Phil
Suck this dick, peppermint, hey baby
I see you're far, yeah, far, baby
Hercules, Hercules
I feast on you, you nurse on me
I love you strongly, they phony
I'm drunk on her, she all on me
Haiti slang, girl you the business
I'm hungry, eat her like Denny's
On this Hannah Montana
Their jewelry's sunny, yours windy
Every day I see you, I wan' fuck you by the pound
I came to the town, discovered it, lost and found
Baby you know I am the one that you want right now
I need two cups whenever I beat it up or down

[Hook: Young Thug]
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt
Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves
Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there
By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12
Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there
Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels'
Pull on up, baby, pull on up
Guns R Us, baby, Toys R Us
I'm livin' that life
Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'ma put that pussy in saran for yah
I'ma pop a Xanny for that ass for yah
I'ma play dead, just like a cask on yah
I'ma bleed red when I go smash on yah
Suck this dick, peppermint, hey baby
I see you're far, yeah, far, baby
I'ma check that bitch up and down in the street
Ain't gon' hold my head down when they see me
I'm a lion, nah fuck it, I'm a beast
But nigga my water blue like a genie
Too much money to go to jail, they can't have a freebie
I bring them racks out the shell, bitch you know they're bleeding
Too crazy, too crazy
Like you could be my baby, lady
Three crazy, three crazy
I just might come for you like the Navy
One crazy, two crazy
New coupe Mercedes
Hey I'm just like this
Too hot, I need a fan, no Tasia

[Hook: Young Thug]
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt
Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves
Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there
By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12
Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there
Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels'
Pull on up, baby, pull on up
Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us
I'm livin' that life
Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I just drink that lean on me, I promise ain't goin' broke
When I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope
I know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes
I know, I know, I know, I know how to get that paper
I know, I know how it feels to stack racks up like acres
I know, I know how it feels, 2,000 channel cable
Ali-ani-ani got me lookin' like the mayor
What you be, Thug? I'm a player
And what, Thug? I'm a slayer
And what, Thug? I make bail
And plus? I won't tell
You're a winner, in a Bimmer
And what? And I'm drinkin' 4 ounces in liter

[Hook: Young Thug]
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt
Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves
Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there
By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12
Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there
Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels'
Pull on up, baby, pull on up
Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us
I'm livin' that life
Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte

[Outro: Young Thug and Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
