[Intro]
(Thugga, Wheezy)
(Yeah! Yeah, yeah, Yeaahh!)
(Haaaa!)

[Chorus]
Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama I'm sorry, got it in order hey
Ballin' like I'm spalding, bitch I'm only startin'
Blowing  money, call it ballin', put some rims inside the water
Everything I say I do it, Hawks game, Thugger on the wood
Eat that jello like pudding, put this log in her life, no wood
(Yeah!)
Before I leave, I'ma make sure that she would
(Yeah!)

[Verse 1]
I won't be a pet, no counseling, I'm gon' make it work
I'll shoot but I ain't talking no bird
I'm screaming flex, she screamin flirt
And now she on me like a perc
My fuckin' weed smell like a turd
I just made 10 mill off of merch
When I take boost I'm so alert
Droppin' my top when I pull up
They bring out the block for me (Skrrr!)
Capital J-O-I-N cause they know there’s no stopping me
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Got my weight up
I must’ve been eating my beef and my broccoli
Bossed up young nigga
Man I don't hit the mall, they shop for me

[Chorus]
Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama I'm sorry, got it in order hey
Ballin' like I'm spalding, bitch I'm only startin'
Blowing  Money, call it ballin', put some rims inside the water
Everything I say I do it, Hawks game, Thugger on wood
Eat that jello like pudding, put this log in her life, no wood
(Yeah!)
Before I leave, I'ma make sure that she would
(Yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Running my money up for all my kids and my niggas
Bitches dont try me they know I bang red I can’t never be cuz
Don't care if you cousin boy it’s disrespectful if you call me cuz
I’m havin' toys and them toys no R Us
Come get your bitch off my dick, sucking my blood like a tick
And I cannot feel or stop it (Yeah)
We are the best, dominant, I zipped down my pants
She gone snort like a pig, she gone out of control
Lil momma know she got a nigga out of control
She know I'ma bring out the sauce just like Chipotle
Shawty pussy wet as a ocean and I know it

[Chorus]
Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama I'm sorry, got it in order hey
Ballin' like I'm spalding, bitch I'm only startin'
Blowing  Money, call it ballin', put some rims inside the water
Everything I say I do it, Hawks game thugga on the wood
Eat that jello like pudding, put this log in her life, no wood
(Yeah!)
Before I leave, I'ma make sure that she would
(Yeah!)
