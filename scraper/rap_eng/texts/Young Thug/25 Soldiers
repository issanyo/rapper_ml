[Bridge: Teddy Sinclair]
This is my soldier symphony
This is my soldier symphony
Guns blazin', hearts racin', we don't play nice
Guns blazin', hearts racin'
'Cause young hearts never die
This is my soldier symphony
This is my soldier, yeah
This is my soldier symphony
I am not afraid of flashin' lights
Red and blue and handcuffs
Afraid not in my life
But justice yet to come
This is my soldier symphony
This is my warzone

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Young Thug]
I got 25 soldiers and 25 holsters
I got 25 soldiers with 25 horses (25)

Yeah you know we ain't the games, you know we pop the things (Ain't about no games)
25 soldiers, 25 holsters (25)
I got 25 soldiers, 25 horses (25, 25)
Man, we ain't about the games, we not about the games (Not about the)
Yeah you know we ain't the games, you know we pop the things, huh

[Outro: Teddy Sinclair]
Yeah, don't test me, I'm not responsible
Don't test me, I am not responsible
Guns blazin', hearts racin', we don't play nice
Guns blazin', hearts racin'
Me a warrior
This is my soldier symphony
This is my soldier symphony
